                        "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy, marked by progressive muscle degeneration with an incidence evaluated at about of 1/5000 males in the general population. The disorder is X-linked recessive. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes for the protein, dystrophin. Dystrophin interacts with other proteins to maintain the integrity and structure of musculoskeletal fibres in skeletal and cardiac (i.e., striated) muscle. In DMD patients, mutations of the DMD gene lead to a complete lack of dystrophin production.",
                        "Involvement of striated muscle begins in early childhood, generally before age of three years and is predominantly observed in males. Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) also involves the DMD gene, and is characterised by residual dystrophin production, so that BMD patients present later and a milder clinical phenotype.",
                        "Deletions of one or more exons of the DMD gene account for approximately 60-70% of pathogenic variants in patients with DMD and BMD. Recently, novel therapeutic approaches to DMD involving exon skipping have been developed to induce the synthesis of a truncated and partially functional dystrophin protein. Eteplirsen (Exondys\u00ae) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 for the treatment of DMD in patients who carry a confirmed mutation that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Several other similar approaches, such as, suvodirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, casimersen, or rAAV-U7snRNA-E53, targeting exons 51, 53 or 45, are currently under evaluation to expand the spectrum of treatable DMD patients.",
                        "Apart from exon-skipping approaches, several gene therapy strategies are also under investigation. Ataluren (PTC124), a drug enabling ribosomal read-through of premature nonsense mutations to produce full-length, functional dystrophin, has shown promising results in several studies. Approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), ataluren is eligible for approximately 13% of DMD patients. Gene therapy using microdystrophin has proven efficacy in different canine models of DMD. Three phase 1/2 clinical trials are currently ongoing to assess safety of AAV-microdystrophin intravenous injection (ClinicalTrials identifier: NCT03368742, NCT03769116, NCT03362502). Many other downstream therapeutic alternatives are currently under investigation, such as, upregulation of utrophin, using GALGT2 gene therapy, idebenone, givinostat, or edasalonexent.",
                        "Considering the current advances in DMD treatment, implementation of comparatively widespread DMD screening such as particularly new-born screening (NBS) for DMD is increasingly being contemplated. To date, technical aspects of population-based screening for DMD have been evaluated in a few pilot studies. These assessments systematically considered the quantification of creatine kinase (CK), or its muscular isoform, CKMM, on dried blood spots (DBS) as a primary marker of DMD. However, CK is a marker of the disease process and does not directly reflect the genetic defect, and both false negatives and false positives occur using either CK or CKMM assays as a first-line test. Accordingly, the sensitivity and specificity of CK- or CKMM-based tests tends to be unsatisfactory. For example, the Wales DMD new-born screening program showed a sensitivity of 81.6% and positive predictive value of 38.6% (Moat et al. Eur J Hum Genet. 2013, vol. 21(10), 1049-1053)."

                        "As corroborated by the experimental section, which illustrates certain representative embodiments of the present invention, the inventors provide highly sensitive and specific assays for the genetic analysis of the DMD gene. Genetic alterations in this gene underlie Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked devastating muscle disease with an early onset. The present assays allow to detect the presence or absence, such as a deletion or partial deletion, of at least exons 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54 and/or at least exons 7, 43, 45, 49 and 51, preferably at least exons 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54 of the DMD gene. Deletions of one or more of these exons can be amenable to currently available exon skipping therapies, in particular exon-51, exon-45, exon-53,exon-8, exon-44, or exon-50 skipping treatments, and hence the present methods provide highly valuable information on the potential occurrence of such treatable DMD mutations (DMD patients eligible for either exon-51, exon-45 or exon-53, exon-8, exon-44, or exon-50 skipping treatments account for approximately 30% of all DMD cases). Indeed, there is rising awareness that DMD patients amenable to exon-skipping should be treated as early as possible (i.e., from birth) in order to maximise the beneficial therapeutic effect. A trial is also ongoing to study the safety and efficacy of eteplirsen in children as young as six months (ClinicalTrials identifier: NCT03218995). The present assays thus offer a reliable and robust test that may be used to detect DMD patients carrying deletion(s) of one or more of the aforementioned DMD exons even in new-borns, facilitating very early initiation of the required treatment (currently, due to a delay in clinical diagnosis of 1.3-2.5 years after the appearance of first symptoms, the mean age at diagnosis of DMD patients is 4.43 years, which reduces the chance of an early and successful therapeutic intervention). Additionally, pre-treating patients before gene therapy using an exon-skipping approach could present major benefits as pre-treatment by exon-skipping therapy potentiates the effect of gene therapy. Such pre-treatment would allow the use of lower\u2014and therefore safer\u2014doses of vector to bring about a higher level of dystrophin expression in the long term. The assays may further optionally detect one or more additional genetic alterations in the DMD gene, in particular one or more pathological mutations in the DMD gene. In certain embodiments, the methods detect the presence or absence of at least exons that are selected such that a deletion in the DMD gene spanning one or more of the exons shifts the reading frame of the DMD gene downstream of the deletion and the reading frame can be restored by exon-skipping therapy. Exon-skipping approaches using antisense oligonucleotides (AO) \u2018masking\u2019 a particular DMD exon such that said exon is omitted from the DMD transcript are conceptually well-understood. A schematic illustration of exon-skipping of DMD exon 51 to restore a reading frame shift caused by the deletion of DMD exon 50 is shown in FIG. 2. Additionally, multi-exon-skipping approaches in which all DMD exons from exon 45 to exon 55 are skipped are also known. Such approaches can potentially address any mutation or deletion in any of these exons which alters the reading frame (such mutations are found in as many as 63% of DMD patients). A DMD transcript in which exon 44 is linked to exon 56 has restored reading frame, and produces internally deleted (\u039445-55) dystrophin, which is known to be at least partly functional from BMD patients.",

                        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD gene), a large protein containing an N-terminal actin-binding domain and multiple spectrin repeats. Dystrophin forms a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) which bridges the inner cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing result in numerous distinct transcript variants and protein isoforms for the DMD gene. Deletions, duplications, and point mutations at the DMD gene locus may cause the severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), or cardiomyopathy. Approximately two-thirds of the mutations in both DMD and BMD are deletions of one or more exons in the dystrophin gene. Although there is no clear correlation found between the extent of the deletion and the severity of the disorder, DMD deletions usually result in frameshift.",

While certain sequences are specifically individualised herein, the skilled person understands that the native nucleic acid sequences of a given locus, gene, exon or intron may differ between or within different individuals of the same species due to normal genetic diversity or variation within such species, and that such naturally-occurring sequence variations or polymorphisms are subsumed by the reference to such genetic elements.",
                        "The instant methods may be contemplated to provide a principally binary answer to the query whether the genetic material of a subject contains or does not contain exon 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and/or 54 of the DMD gene. By means of an example, the methods may thus conclude that any one, or any two, or any three, or any four, or any five, any six, any seven, any eight, any nine, or all ten of DMD exons 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54 are absent from the genetic material of the subject, whereas the remaining ones of DMD exons 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54 are present. For example, the methods may thus conclude that any one, or any two, or any three, or any four or all five of DMD exons 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54 and/or any one, or any two, or any three, or any four or all five of DMD exons 7, 43, 45, 49 and 51 are absent from the genetic material of the subject, whereas the remaining ones of DMD exons 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54 and/or DMD exons 7, 43, 45, 49 and 51 are present. The relevance of this information lies in the fact that a large proportion of pathogenic mutations in patients with DMD or BMD are deletions of one or more DMD exons, including one or more DMD exons selected from DMD exons 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54. Because the dystrophin gene resides at the X chromosome, males only carry one DMD gene allele, i.e., are hemizygous for the DMD gene, and the deletion of one or more exons in that DMD gene allele will mean that such exon or exons will be altogether absent in the genetic material of a male subject. Typically, a deletion in the DMD gene may span more than one exon, such as for example a deletion may span or remove DMD exons 13-44, 20-44, 46-55, 45-55, 46-53, 46-52, 45-50, 45-48, 45-47, 45-46, 46-48, 45-47, 45-48, 48-55, 49-54, 51-55, or 51-64, or so on. Accordingly, where two or more of DMD exons 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54 are absent from the genetic material of the a subject, these will typically be two or more exons that are adjacent or successive in the series 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54.",
                        "Disease-causing deletions in the DMD gene may commonly eliminate the whole or entire sequence of one or more DMD exons, and in case of the deletion of multiple exons also the intronic sequences interposed there between. Hence, the reference to the absence of an exon may typically contemplate the deletion of an entire exon, i.e., the deletion of the complete exon sequence (typically together with the intronic sequences adjacent to the exon), but the deletion of a portion of the exon is also encompassed. A portion of an exon in this context denotes a substantial portion of the exon, such as the deletion of at least 20% or at least 50% or at least 70% of the exon sequence, rather than minor deletions such as deletions affecting a single one or only a few nucleotides.",

Preferably, a human subject may be within the first 5 days, more preferably within the first 48 hours from birth. In certain embodiments, the present methods, which can be run in practical and cost-effective way, can allow to make DMD screening a part of the standard new-born screening (NBS) tests, which typically employ dried blood spot (DBS) material as explained elsewhere in this specification. Advantageously, in many countries DNA is already extracted from DBS material for the new-born screening of spinal muscular atrophy, and such DNA material can also be readily used for the present methods.

For example, the detection of the presence or absence of at least exons 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54 of the DMD gene may be multiplexed in one single polymerase-based nucleic acid amplification reaction, and the detection of the presence or absence of at least exons 7, 43, 45, 49, and 51 of the DMD gene may be multiplexed in another, separate single polymerase-based nucleic acid amplification reaction, whereby the two separate multiplexed reactions can together yield information on all exons 7, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 54.

In many embodiments, the primer extension reaction conditions are amplification conditions, which conditions include a plurality of reaction cycles, where each reaction cycle comprises: (1) a denaturation step, (2) an annealing step, and (3) a polymerisation step. The number of reaction cycles will vary depending on the application being performed, but will usually be at least 15, more usually at least 20, and may be as high as 60 or higher, where the number of different cycles will typically range from about 20 to 40, preferably from about 30 to 40, also preferably about 40 such as exactly 40. For methods where more than about 25, usually more than about 30 cycles are performed, it may be convenient or desirable to introduce additional polymerase into the reaction mixture such that conditions suitable for enzymatic primer extension are maintained. The denaturation step comprises heating the reaction mixture to an elevated temperature and maintaining the mixture at the elevated temperature for a period of time sufficient for any double-stranded or hybridised nucleic acid present in the reaction mixture to dissociate. For denaturation, the temperature of the reaction mixture will usually be raised to, and maintained at, a temperature ranging from about 85 to 100\u00b0 C., usually from about 90 to 98\u00b0 C., and more usually from about 93 to 96\u00b0 C., for a period of time ranging from about 3 to 120 sec.

In this embodiment, the annealing and extension processes occur in the same step. The temperature to which the reaction mixture is lowered to achieve these conditions will usually be chosen to provide optimal efficiency and specificity, and will generally range from about 50 to 75\u00b0 C., usually from about 55 to 70\u00b0 C., and more usually from about 60 to 68\u00b0 C., more particularly around 60\u00b0 C., e.g., 60\u00b0 C. or 61\u00b0 C.

Where the reaction fails to amplify any of the DMD exons (which may be possible if all exons are deleted), the inclusion of a positive control in the multiplexed reaction can serve to quality control the reaction. If the real-time PCR reader is constrained in the number of channels such that a positive control cannot be included in the multiplexed reaction, it is for example possible to re-run the sample in duplex qPCR reactions, combining each individual DMD exon with a positive control such as the RPP30 reference gene to confirm the DMD exon deletion.",

Real-time PCR using molecular beacons. Methods Mol Med 54: 295-310; Marras SAE. 2006. Selection of fluorophore and quencher pairs for fluorescent nucleic acid hybridization probes. Methods Mol Biol 335: 3-16; Marras SAE et al. 2006. Real-time assays with molecular beacons and other fluorescent nucleic acid hybridization probes. Clin Chim Acta 363: 48-60 for further discussion of molecular beacons detection). Another system is the Light Upon Extension (LUX\u2122) system commercialised by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) and described in detail in Nazarenko et al. 2002 (Nucleic Acids Research 30: e37) and Nazarenko et al. 2002 (Nucleic Acids Research 30: 2089-2095). For additional description of ways to detect and evaluate amplification products in real-time (e.g., using adjacent probes; 5\u2032-nuclease probes such as Taqman\u2122; Light-up probes; Duplex scorpion primers; Amplifluor primers; and further alternative fluorescent hybridisation probe formats) see, e.g., Marras SAE et al. 2006.
