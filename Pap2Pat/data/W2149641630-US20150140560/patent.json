    "abstract": "The disclosure provides a label-free viscosity-based analyte detection system using paramagnetic beads as an asynchronous magnetic bead rotation (AMBR) microviscometer. It is disclosed herein that the bead rotation period is linearly proportional to the viscosity of a solution comprising analytes surrounding the paramagnetic bead. Optical measurement of asynchronous microbead motion determines solution viscosity precisely in microscale volumes, thus allowing an estimate of analyte concentration. The results demonstrate the feasibility of viscosity-based analyte detection using AMBR in microscale aqueous volumes.",

Chem. 43(11): 2021-2038 (1997); Valasek et al., Adv Physiol Educ 29(3): 151-159 (2005); Mandal et al., Am. J. Food Technol 6: 87-102 (2011); van Oorschot et al., Investig genet 1(1), 14 (2010)]. In medical diagnostics, especially for infectious diseases, DNA detection technology such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and ligation detection reaction (LDR) are crucial diagnostic tools [Landegren et al., Science 242(4876): 229-237 (1998); Kubista et al., Mol Aspects Med 27(2-3), 95-125 (2006); Handal et al., Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics 6(1), 29-38 (2006)]. Fluorescence has been used almost exclusively as the DNA detection method in these tools due to its simplicity and high sensitivity [Kubista et al., Mol Aspects Med 27(2-3), 95-125 (2006); Handal et al., Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics 6(1), 29-38 (2006)]. Recently, numerous efforts have been made to seek more cost-effective DNA detection technologies, notably for use in the developing world, yet none of them achieve the same sensitivity and applicability as fluorescence-based methods [Li et al., PLoS ONE 6(12): e29224 (2011); Diakite et al., Lab Chip 12(22): 4738-4747 (2012); Leslie et al., J.

Chem. 77(2): 383-392 (2005)]. The viscosity of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) solution at a known temperature depends on the mass concentration and the average length of the DNA strands. The solution viscosity can indicate DNA concentration and/or length [Huggins J. Am. Chem. Soc. 64(11): 2716-2718 (1942); Ross et al., Biopolymers 6(8): 1005-1018 (1968); Tsortos et al., Biopolymers 95(12), 824-832 (2011)]. In restriction digestion reactions the solution viscosity decreases as longer DNA strands are cut into shorter pieces. Alternatively, in PCR, the solution viscosity increases as the length of the DNA increases, through polymerization of the target sequence."

AMBR detection monitors the rotational motion of a free-floating magnetic bead placed in a rotating magnetic field and uses changes in this motion to infer physical properties of the surrounding solution. When the rotation rate of the external field exceeds a critical value, the bead rotates at a speed different from that of the external field. The rate of this asynchronous rotation is viscosity dependent. Readily available paramagnetic microbeads can thus be used for measuring changes in analyte concentrations or average lengths of specific analytes, such as, without limitation, DNA.",

                        "Described herein are methods for analysis of one or more analytes using magnetic particles. In particular, described herein are asynchronous magnetic bead rotation (AMBR) methods for analysis of analytes. AMBR is additionally described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,846,331, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The methods of the disclosure are based on the use of a magnetic particle, which magnetic particle is free in the sample volume and is not tethered to the analyte of interest. As a result of a change in state of the analyte, the viscosity of the sample is varied. Such a variance in the viscosity is detectable by the magnetic particle and the use of AMBR technology, and is correlated with the change in state. The change in state can be translated to, for example and without limitation, the concentration of the analyte in the sample and/or the average length of an analyte. Moreover, the present techniques are able to detect microviscosity changes which correlate to small scale changes in the analyte, such as small scale changes in the length or concentration of the analyte. Moreover still, these microviscosity changes that can be measured may be used in various other physical state change and chemical change applications. For example, viscosity changes, measured through an AMBR technology can be used to detect deterioration of chemicals in a solution, e.g. deterioration of engine oils over time, olive oils, etc. Plus these chemical changes may be measured at scales heretofore un-attainable through conventional means, not without expensive equipment such as molecular imaging techniques, and the like.",
                        "In a specific aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of detecting amplification of a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) in a sample in real-time. In such an aspect, the change in viscosity that occurs in the sample via the polymerization of DNA is detectable by the magnetic particle using the methods described herein.",
                        "As can be seen, generally speaking, the present techniques may be used to determine any number of small scale physical state changes and chemical changes, in solution, so long as those changes result in and correlate to small-scale, e.g., microviscometric. changes in the solution, i.e., viscosity changes detectable through the techniques described herein.",
                        "The advantages of using the methods provided by the disclosure center on the ability of the AMBR microviscometer to detect very small changes in the viscosity of a sample. Further, such small changes in viscosity are detectable in small sample volumes. It was unexpected that such small changes in viscosity (e.g., the changes in viscosity generated in a sample in which qPCR is being performed) could be detected using the AMBR technique. In view of such an ability of the AMBR technique, however, new applications are made available. For example, and without limitation, use of the methods provided herein eliminate the need for a label (such as a fluorescent label) and also allow for rapid quantification of an analyte in real-time.",

                                "Typically, in AMBR, a magnetic particle (e.g., a bead) is exposed to a driving rotating magnetic field that is rotating above a critical frequency so that the rotational rate of the magnetic particle is sensitized to changes in the shape or size of the particle including object bound to the particle. In some cases (e.g., particularly with ferromagnetic beads) at low driving rates the magnetic bead rotates synchronously with the driving magnetic field, referred to as the synchronous mode. When the magnetic particle rotates at a rate that is slower than the driving rate, the system may be referred to as operating in the asynchronous mode. In contrast to the synchronous mode, in the asynchronous mode the rate of rotation of the magnetic particle slows as viscosity of the solution comprising the analyte increases. While the magnetic particles remain in the synchronous mode, changes in viscosity do not slow the rotation of the magnetic particle.",
                                "The magnetic particles that may be used for AMBR are, in various embodiments, paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, or ferromagnetic. Although the various examples described herein refer to analytes that are DNA, other analytes may be detected, including but not limited to molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, etc.), nucleotides, cells, and the like. If the analyte is a cell, such as a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell or cells (e.g., bacterial, cancer cells, etc.), the rate of rotation of the magnetic particle in the asynchronous rotation mode may depend upon the concentration or aggregation of the cells in a solution. Changes in the cell number or changes in the aggregation of the cells will alter the rotational rate of the magnetic particles. Thus, by monitoring the rate of rotation of the magnetic bead or beads in the asynchronous mode, it is possible to detect and monitor changes in viscosity of the solution comprising the analyte.",
                                "Currently, AMBR systems may monitor the rotation of magnetic particles under the driving rotating magnetic field to detect the asynchronous rate of rotation. The rate of rotation is typically monitored using a laser (e.g., focusing laser or coherent light source), a microscope, camera, and typically software to help visualize and detect the rate of rotation. Devices, systems and methods performing AMBR are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,846,331, incorporated herein by reference, in relevant part.",
                                "AMBR devices use magnetic beads that may rotate asynchronously when a driving magnetic field used to rotate the magnetic beads exceeds a critical frequency. Above this critical frequency, the particle's rotation is asynchronous with the external field, thus the particle is in an asynchronous condition. In some of the variations described herein, the magnetic beads are clustered so that the AMBR technique may be applied by rotating the entire cluster (or in some variations multiple clusters) of magnetic particles in the asynchronous mode. Changes in this asynchronous rotational rate of the entire cluster of particles may be used to detect changes in viscosity of a solution. Furthermore, measurement of a cluster's rotation can be performed with any of the AMBR devices described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,846,331 using low-cost and readily available electronic components, e.g. diodes and photodiodes, allowing for broad applicability. Rather than only being able to measure changes in viscosity, the AMBR methods described herein are powerful in that they are able to correlate small changes in viscosity with a quantification of the concentration of an analyte and/or the average length of an analyte such as a nucleic acid.",
                                "Relative to previous understanding of AMBR, the methods of the disclosure advantageously work in small sample volumes.

Essential amino acids cannot be made by the reference body, typically a human body. As a result, they must come from food. The nine essential amino acids for humans are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. \u201cNonessential\u201d means that the body, such as the human body, produces an amino acid, even if it is not obtained from the food we eat. Nonessential amino acids include alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. Conditional amino acids are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress; for humans, these include arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, glycine, ornithine, proline, and serine.",

                                "A linear relationship was found between the solution viscosity and the rotation period of the bead in the solution. A series of glycerol/water solutions with varying glycerol mass fraction were analyzed by the AMBR microviscometer and, in parallel, with an Ubbelohde viscometer [Cragg et al., Can. J. Chem. 39(1): 203-215 (1961)]. The microviscometer results matched both the Ubbelohde viscosity values and the theoretically predicted values for the mixtures over a viscosity range from 0.89 to 2.8 centipoise (cP) (FIG. 1(c)) [Sheely, Industrial & Engineering Chemistry 24(9): 1060-1064 (1932)]. A correlation curve relating the bead rotation period with the solution viscosity was constructed and yielded excellent uniformity (FIG. 1(d)). The experimentally observed linear relationship between rotation and viscosity agrees well with the theory developed for the paramagnetic AMBR system [Kinnunen et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 26(5), 2751-2755 (2011)]. Additionally, the linear correlation is robust to variation in the magnetic field driving frequency (FIG. 3), and for three different bead sizes tested, with the 45 \u03bcm beads giving optimal linear correlation results (FIG. 4). The slope of the curve as defined by Equation (3) increases with decreasing magnetic responsiveness of the magnetic beads and increasing bead sizes (FIG. 4). The magnetic responsiveness takes into account a combination of factors, such as the volume of the magnetic content and the magnetic susceptibility, as defined in Equation (3). The data show that a smaller magnetic responsiveness gives a larger rotation period, under the same field, resulting in a larger slope (compare FIG. 4B with FIGS. 4A and 4C); also a bigger bead size improves the sensitivity of the viscometer, when the magnetic responsiveness is about the same (compare FIGS. 4A and 4C). These experimental observations are in agreement with the theoretical predictions indicated by Equation (3) (see below).",
                                "However, the linearity does not hold as well for a frequency close to the instability threshold, as shown in FIG. 3. Furthermore, the measurement of rotation period is not as reliable, because the jerky motion affects the image analysis.",
                                "The observed linear correlation between solution viscosity and bead rotation period can be explained by the nonlinear magnetic oscillation theoretical framework [Kinnunen et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 26(5): 2751-2755 (2011); McNaughton et al., Sens. Actuators, B 121(1): 330-340 (2007); Sinn et al., Lab Chip 11(15): 2604-2611 (2011); Helgesen et al., Phys. Rev. A 42(12): 7271-7280 (1990); Helgesen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 64(12): 1425-1428 (1990)]. At a low driving frequency, the bead rotates at the same rate as the driving magnetic field. However, as the driving frequency increases, the bead cannot overcome the viscous drag exerted by the surrounding fluid, and thus cannot follow the rotating magnetic field. The bead then rotates slower, and asynchronously, with respect to the driving magnetic field (FIG. 1(b)) [Kinnunen et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 26(5): 2751-2755 (2011); Sinn et al., Lab Chip 11(15): 2604-2611 (2011); Helgesen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 64(12): 1425-1428 (1990); Chevry et al., Phys. Rev.

The nonlinear oscillation only occurs in the asynchronous regime. In a low Reynolds number environment, the force balance between the magnetic torque and the viscous drag yields the relationship between the bead rotation period and the solution viscosity. The effects of interaction between the magnetic bead and the solid surface can be neglected under the experimental conditions described herein. For a paramagnetic bead, the magnetic torque due to the induced magnetic dipole can be expressed as [Kinnunen et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 26(5): 2751-2755 (2011)],",

                                "To advance the practical utility of the asynchronous rotation method, the influence of the variation in bead properties on bead rotation periods was investigated. A relative standard deviation of approximately 10% is observed due to the variation in bead properties, such as size and magnetic content. As shown in FIG. 5(a), the rotation periods of 20 beads in the same solution do not show a clear bead-size dependency. Thus, bead-size non-uniformity is not the primary contributor to the variation in the rotation period measurement, despite the expected correlation in Equation (3). More likely, the bead magnetic properties, such as magnetic volume and susceptibility, are more significant for the inter-bead variation than is the size variation. The scattered pattern in FIG. 5(a) supports the averaging over multiple beads in the construction of correlation curves and viscosity measurement experiments.",

The differences in rotation period over time are much smaller than the differences between two beads in the same experiment (FIG. 5(b)). The relative standard deviation for a single bead over time is approximately 1%, 10 times smaller than the standard deviation in the rotation period among 10 beads. Therefore, the observed measurement error is smaller than the error caused by bead non-uniformity. A wide variation in commercial bead properties has been observed before [Connolly et al., Bio-Med.

With the experimental relationship given in FIG. 1(c), the viscosities of the DNA EcoRI digest solutions were estimated, at different concentrations, using the measured bead rotation periods. A linear relationship was found between the solution viscosity and the DNA concentration (Table 1 and FIG. 6(a)), confirming the assumption that these solutions were in the dilute solution range. The viscosities of the DNA solutions measured using the AMBR microviscometer are within the theoretically estimated upper and lower bounds.",

                                "Measurements of restriction digestion samples confirm that the AMBR microviscometer is sensitive to viscosity changes caused by the DNA size changes. As shown in FIG. 6(b), a clear difference in bead rotation period can be seen between the digested and undigested lambda DNA solutions. Thus, the AMBR microviscometer can detect DNA sequence variation using a site-specific restriction endonuclease to essentially alter the solution viscosity.",
                                "Measurements of PCR samples over the course of the reaction show that the AMBR microviscometer can detect the formation of PCR products in real time. As expected, the reactions with the higher initial template concentration reach the maximum product concentration sooner than those with lower template concentrations (FIG. 6(c)), and the plot of reaction cycle number versus log of initial DNA concentration yields a linear correlation (FIG. 7). Comparing the AMBR measurements with the gel electrophoresis results on the same samples (FIG. 6(d)) confirms that the viscosity-based method is approximately 5 cycles delayed, relative to gel electrophoresis detection.",
                                "Using commercial paramagnetic beads, the AMBR microviscometer is found to be sensitive to the viscosity changes associated with DNA reactions. The results on PCR, with a product size of 4500 bp, yielded a 10% relative error in the rotation period measurement. The AMBR microviscometer is able to detect PCR product sizes that are about 1000 bp, assuming a conversion of more than 95% of dNTPs to polymerized product (i.e., 0.42 g/L final product concentration). However, this sensitivity can be further improved so as to meet the need of monitoring DNA reactions with smaller viscosity changes (e.g., PCRs with shorter DNA products) by optimizing the bead size, shape, temperature, vibration, and magnetic properties. Based on the 1% relative error observed for single-bead measurements, over time, the AMBR microviscometer is able to detect PCR with product size as low as 50 bp. By measuring the changes in viscosity of DNA solutions, the methods disclosed herein can measure either the difference in molecular length for a known concentration or the difference in concentration for a known length.",
                                "In summary, the viscosity-based approach using an AMBR microviscometer introduces a new option for label-free DNA detection and for reaction monitoring. In the viscosity range of common DNA reactions, the measurement is completed within one minute, and a typical AMBR microviscometer set-up allows continuous, real-time measurement during the course of any reaction. This viscometer requires only a small amount of sample, and volumes in the picoliter range are accessible if integrated into a microfluidic device. A laser-photodiode apparatus can easily replace the microscope detection setup used in this work, so as to make the measurement more cost-effective [Hecht et al., Biosens. Bioelectron. 48: 26-32 (2013)]. Although demonstrated with DNA solutions, the viscosity-based technology described here can be applied to any polymer reaction or degradation system, as used in the broadest sense of the term \u201cpolymer\u201d to refer to conventional chemical polymers and to such aggregations and dis-aggregations as would be found in cell-cell interactions. The improved understanding provided herein of the AMBR microviscometer performance in complex fluids enables new applications, including without limitation mapping the viscosity in living cells, understanding drug delivery mechanisms, and diagnosing blood clotting."
