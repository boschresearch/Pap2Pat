                        "Conventional prenatal diagnostic methods with invasive procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, carry potential risks for both fetuses and mothers. Noninvasive screening of fetal aneuploidy using maternal serum markers and ultrasound are available but have limited sensitivity and specificity (Kagan, et al., Human Reproduction (2008) 23:1968-1975; Malone, et al., N Engl J Med (2005) 353:2001-2011).",
                        "Recent studies have demonstrated noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidy by massively parallel sequencing of DNA molecules in the plasma of pregnant women is feasible. Fetal DNA has been detected and quantitated in maternal plasma and serum (Lo, et al., Lancet (1997) 350:485 487; Lo, et al., Am. J. hum. Genet. (1998) 62:768-775). Multiple fetal cell types occur in the maternal circulation, including fetal granulocytes, lymphocytes, nucleated red blood cells, and trophoblast cells (Pertl and Bianchi, Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001) 98:483-490). Fetal DNA can be detected in the serum at the seventh week of gestation, and increases with the term of the pregnancy. The fetal DNA present in the maternal serum and plasma is comparable to the concentration of DNA obtained from fetal cell isolation protocols.",
                        "Circulating fetal DNA has been used to determine the sex of the fetus (Lo, et al., Am. J. hum. Genet. (1998) 62:768-775). Also, fetal rhesus D genotype has been detected using fetal DNA. However, the diagnostic and clinical applications of circulating fetal DNA is limited to genes that are present in the fetus but not in the mother (Pertl and Bianchi, Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001) 98:483-490). Thus, a need still exists for a non invasive method that can determine the sequence of fetal DNA and provide definitive diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities in a fetus.",
                        "The discovery of fetal cells and cell-free fetal nucleic acids in maternal blood in the past few decades and the application of high-throughput shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma cell-free DNA make it is available to detect small changes in the representation of chromosomes contributed by an aneuploid fetus in a maternal plasma sample. Non-invasive detection of trisomy 13, 18, and 21 pregnancies have been achieved.",
                        "However, as some studies show, GC bias introduced by amplification and sequencing placed a practical limit on the sensitivity of aneuploidy detection. GC bias might be introduced during the sample preparation and the sequencing process, under different conditions such as reagent composition, cluster density and temperature, which leads to differential sampling of DNA molecules with different GC composition and significant variation in sequencing data for chromosomes that are GC-rich or GC-poor.",
                        "To improve sensitivity, protocols for removal of the effect of GC-bias have been developed. Fan and Quake developed a method to computationally remove GC bias by applying weight to each GC density based on local genomic GC content, to ameliorate the number of reads mapped in each bin by multiplying corresponding weight (Fan and Quake PLoS ONE (2010) 5:e10439). However, the method has difficulty in dealing with sex chromosome disorders especially chromosome Y relevant disorders for the reason that the process may cause slight distortion of data which will interfere with the precision of detection.",
                        "Here, we describe a method to computationally remove the GC-bias in order to get a higher sensitivity in fetal genetic abnormality detection as well as avoid data distortion. This method defines parameters used for statistical test according to GC-content. In addition, we introduced the estimated fetal fraction into the diagnosis by binary hypothesis which showed higher sensitivity and specificity. Our method also shows it should be possible to increase the sensitivity of noninvasive detection of fetal genetic abnormality to preset precision for maternal sample containing a low fetal DNA fraction by sequencing more polynucleotide fragments. Resampling of maternal plasma in later gestational weeks may also increase the sensitivity of diagnosis."

                                "Monosomy X (XO, absence of an entire X chromosome) is the most common type of Turner syndrome, occurring in 1 in 2500 to 1 in 3000 live-born girls (Sybert and McCauley N Engl J Med (2004) 351:1227-1238). XXY syndrome is a condition in which human males have an extra X chromosome, existing in roughly 1 out of every 1000 males (Bock, Understanding Klinefelter Syndrome: A Guide for XXY Males and Their Families. NIH Pub. No. 93-3202 (1993)). XYY syndrome is an aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes in which a human male receives an extra Y chromosome, giving a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the more usual 46, affecting 1 in 1000 male births while potentially leading to male infertility (Aksglaede, et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab (2008) 93:169-176).",

Typical females have two X chromosomes, but in Turner syndrome, one of those sex chromosomes is missing. Occurring in 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 phenotypic females, the syndrome manifests' itself in a number of ways. Klinefelter syndrome is a condition in which human males have an extra X chromosome. In humans, Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 1,000 males. XYY syndrome is an aneuploidy of the sex chromosomes in which a human male receives an extra Y chromosome, giving a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the more usual 46. This produces a 47, XYY karyotype. This condition is usually asymptomatic and affects 1 in 1000 male births while potentially leading to male infertility.",

These templates are sequenced using four-color DNA sequencing-by-synthesis technology. See products offered by Illumina, Inc., San Diego, Calif. The presently used sequencing is preferably carried out without a preamplification or cloning step, but may be combined with amplification-based methods in a microfluidic chip having reaction chambers for both PCR and microscopic template-based sequencing. Only about 30 bp of random sequence information are needed to identify a sequence as belonging to a specific human chromosome. Longer sequences can uniquely identify more particular targets. In the present case, a large number of 35 bp reads were obtained. Further description of a massively parallel sequencing method is found in Rogers and Ventner, Nature (2005) 437:326-327.",

We used software to produce the reference unique reads by incising the hg18 reference sequences into 1-mer (1-mer here is a read being artificially decomposed from the human sequence reference with the same \u201c1\u201d length with sample sequencing reads) and collected those \u201cunique\u201d 1-mer as our reference unique reads. Secondly, we mapped our sequenced sample reads to the reference unique reads of each chromosome. Thirdly, we deleted the outlier by applying quintile outlier cutoff method to get a clear data set. Finally, we counted the coverage depth of each chromosome for every sample and the GC content of the sequenced unique reads mapped to each chromosome for every sample.",
                                "In order to investigate how GC content affects our data, we chose 300 euploid cases with karyotype result and scattered their coverage depth and related GC content of sequenced reads into a graph, which showed a strong correlation between them, and this phenomenon was unreported previously (FIG. 2). In FIG. 2, coverage depth correlated strongly with the GC-content, and showed an obviously downward trend in some chromosomes such as 4, 13, etc., while upward trend in other chromosomes such as 19, 22, etc. All chromosomes were arranged in ascending order by their inherent GC-content and a downward tendency is present in lower GC-content group chromosomes while upward tendency in higher GC-content group chromosomes as shown in FIG. 3. It can be interpreted that if the polynucleotide fragments being sequenced for one sample has a higher GC-content than the other sample, the coverage depth representing this sample would drop comparing to that of the other sample in lower GC-content group chromosomes while rose in higher GC-content group chromosomes.",
                                "The possible explanation for such a different changing tendency among different GC-content chromosomes is the differences in GC-content composition in different chromosomes shown in FIG. 4 combined with the GC-bias introduced in the sequencing process. The GC content of every 35-mer reference unique reads for each chromosome is used to classify GC content into 36 levels. The percentage of each level as the composition GC of each chromosome was calculated and then used to draw the heatmap with the Heatmap2 software. Take chromosome 13 as an example, large part of it consists of lower GC-content sequence segments but small part of it consists of higher GC-content sequence segments. If conditions during the sequencing or PCR process is in favor of sequence those segment with higher GC-content, then a relative large part of chromosome 13 with low GC-content would be hard to be sequenced with a result that the coverage depth in this sample's chromosome 13 was becoming lower. In comparison, in a higher GC-content group such as chromosome 19, the coverage depth in this sample's chromosome 19 is becoming higher for that a large part of chromosome 19 was of higher GC-content to which the sequencer prefers. No matter in which chromosome, GC-poor and GC-rich segments were hard to be sequenced but the influence introduced by GC-bias was different to different chromosomes with different GC-content composition. Every reference chromosome was divided into 1 KB bins, the GC content of each unique reference read in the bin was calculated. The GC content of each bin in the proper interval form [0.3, 0.6] divided by step size of 0.001, and the relative coverage in every interval is calculated. FIG. 5 shows plots of relative coverage and GC content for each chromosome.",

                                "Measuring aneuploidy remains challenging because of the high background of maternal DNA (Fan, et al., Proc Nall Acad Sci USA (2008) 42:16266-16271) and arbitrary small fetal DNA fraction was the most significant restraining factor for aneuploidy detection by massively parallel genome sequencing (MPGS) approach to this day. However, there was no big breakthrough in determining the minimum fetal DNA fraction clinically before MPGS detection especially for female fetuses while the only clinical clue related to implicate the fraction of fetal DNA was gestational weeks. It was reported that there is a statistically significant correlation between the fetal DNA fraction and gestational age previously (Lo, et al., Am. J. Human Genet. (1998) 62:768-775). In our study, to investigate the relationship between estimated fetal DNA fraction and gestational age, we plotted in FIG. 12 the fetal DNA fraction of all those participating cases with male fetuses (totally 427 cases) referred to estimation Formula 10. The estimated fetal DNA fraction for each sample correlates with gestational age (P smaller than 0.0001). It also showed that even though in the gestational age 20, there were 4 out of 65 cases with fetal DNA fraction less than 5%, which would adversely affect the detection accuracy. To evaluate the fetal fraction estimation method we selected some cases hierarchically distributed in estimated fetal fraction, and then Q-PCR helped to calculate another relative fetal fraction. Then we got a correlation standard curve showing a strong correlation between them which demonstrated the estimation of fetal fraction by our method is credible.",
                                "Meanwhile, the sequencing depth (the number of total unique reads) was another significant factor affecting the precision of aneuploidy detection embodying in the value of standard variation. The standard variation for each chromosome employed in our GC-correlated approach could be fixed under a certain level of sequencing depth when the reference case number reaches 150 (FIG. 13). To investigate how the sequencing depth influence the standard variation for each chromosome, we sequenced 150 cases not only in our 1.7 million level but in another sequencing depth level with the number of total unique reads reaching 5 million (SD=1.7 million). Depending on these two sets, we found the standard variance is linear with reciprocal of square of the total unique reads number demonstrated in FIG. 6.",
                                "For a given fetal DNA fraction, we could estimate the total unique reads number required in our method to detect deviation of chromosome copy number from normal at t1 equal 3 (FIG. 14). It showed that the less the fetal DNA fraction was, the greater sequencing depth required. In our 1.7 million unique reads set, our approach is able to detect aneuploidy fetuses for chromosome 13 and X with fetal DNA fraction more than 4.5% and aneuploidy fetuses for chromosome 21 and 18 more than 4%; while in our 5 million reference set, our approach was capable to detect trisomy 18 and trisomy 21 even with the fetal DNA fraction about 3%. If we want to identify fetuses abnormal in chromosome X such as XXX or XO with the fetal fraction about 4%, the required total unique number in those cases and corresponding reference cases should reach 5 million. If the fetal DNA is less than 3.5%, the sequencing depth requirement would beyond 20M. And if the DNA fetal fraction was lower the detection would become incredible and difficult so we proposed another strategy, that is, we should re-sampling the pregnant woman's plasma, re-do our experiment and re-analyze the data when the gestational age become larger on the great probability that fetal DNA fraction would be elevated along with the increasing of gestational age. And this strategy also can be applied to samples suspected to have small fetal DNA fraction.",

                                "We calculated the theoretical sensitivity of aneuploidy with following steps. Firstly, we applied regression analysis to fit fetal DNA fraction with gestational age {circumflex over (f)}ri=\u0192(gsai), where {circumflex over (f)}ri is the fitting mean of fetal DNA fraction in ith gestational age gsai, and estimated the approximate fetal DNA fraction distribution by employing Gaussian kernel density estimation (Birke, (2008) Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 139:2851-2862) mainly referring to estimated fetal DNA fraction distributed in 19 and 20 gestational weeks before extrapolating the fetal DNA fraction distribution in the other weeks according to the relationship between fetal DNA fraction and gestational age",

Secondly, we estimated the standard variance according to total unique reads number as we mentioned before {circumflex over (\u03c3)}=\u0192(tuqn) where tuqn is total unique reads number. Finally, to calculate the sensitivity in every gestational age at a certain sequencing depth level according to the fetal DNA fraction distribution and standard variance estimated in each sequencing depth, we computed the probability density of false negative in every fetal DNA fraction (here, we supposed that the fetal DNA fraction fluctuation normally distributed) and then integrated them to get a false negative rate (FNR) in a gestational age consisting of all levels of fetal DNA fraction FNR(fr, week)=\u222b01pd(fr)\u222b0a/\u03c3=3 exp(x\u2212fr)2/2\u00b7\u03c3j2dxdfr where j is chromosome j. Easily, the theoretical sensitivity in a certain sequencing depth in this gestational age is calculated as 1-FNR. FIGS. 15-21 show the resulting plots of our calculation. The student-t larger than 3 was set to identify female fetus aneuploidy while for male fetus, when computing probability density of false negative in every fraction, a logarithm likelihood larger than 1 was employed as the critical value we mentioned in Binary hypothesis which helped to achieve a higher sensitivity comparing to female ones.",
                                "However, our inference is relative conservative for the reason that it is hard to get a distribution infinitely approximate to real distribution of fetal DNA fraction along with gestational age especially in small gestational age in small-scale sampling."
