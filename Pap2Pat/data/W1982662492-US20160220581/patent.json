                                "Chromium is an essential trace element. The essentiality of chromium in the diet was established in 1959 by Schwartz. (Schwartz, \u201cPresent Knowledge in Nutrition,\u201d page 571, fifth edition (1984, the Nutrition Foundation, Washington, D.C.)). Chromium is essential for optimal insulin activity in all known insulin-dependent systems (Boyle et al. (1977) Southern Med. J. 70:1449-1453). Chromium depletion is characterized by the disturbance of glucose, lipid and protein metabolism and by a shortened lifespan. Insufficient dietary chromium has been linked to both maturity-onset diabetes and to cardiovascular disease.",
                                "Dietary supplementation of chromium to normal individuals has been reported to lead to improvements in glucose tolerance, serum lipid concentrations, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin and insulin binding. (Anderson (1986) Clin. Psychol. Biochem. 4:31-41). Supplemental chromium in the trivalent form, e.g. chromic chloride, is associated with improvements of risk factors associated with adult-onset (Type 2) diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Chromium supplementation has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia, as well as promote weight loss, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,929,066, 6,329,361, and 6,809,115, which are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In a clinical study, Anderson et al. (Metabolism (1987) 36(4):351-355, 1987), chromium supplementation was shown to alleviate hypoglycemic symptoms and raise serum glucose levels out of the hypoglycemic range. In another study, chromium supplementation to overweight children with Type 1 diabetes did not result in any cases of hypoglycemia (May, 2007). In yet another study, chromium supplementation to adults with Type 1 diabetes did not result in any cases of hypoglycemia; and allowed a 50% reduction in insulin dose (Ravina et al. (1995) J. Trace Elements in Experimental Med. 12:71-83).",
                                "The principal energy sources for the body are glucose and fatty acids. Chromium depletion results in biologically ineffective insulin and compromised glucose metabolism. Under these conditions, the body relies primarily upon lipid metabolism to meet its energy requirements, resulting in the production of excessive amounts of acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies. Some of the acetyl-CoA can be diverted to increased cholesterol biosynthesis, resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized in large part by glycosuria, hypercholesterolemia, and often ketoacidosis. The accelerated atherosclerotic process seen in diabetics is associated with hypercholesterolemia. (Boyle et al. (1977) Southern Med. J. 70:1449-1453).",
                                "Chromium functions as a cofactor for insulin. It binds to the insulin receptor and potentiates many, and perhaps all, of its functions. (Boyle et al. (1977) Southern Med. J. 70:1449-1453). These functions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. (Schwartz, \u201cPresent Knowledge in Nutrition,\u201d page 571, fifth edition (1984, the Nutrition Foundation, Washington, D.C.)). The introduction of inorganic chromium compounds per se into individuals is not particularly beneficial. Chromium must be converted endogenously into an organic complex or must be consumed as a biologically active molecule. Only about 0.5% of ingested inorganic chromium, however, is assimilated into the body. (Recommended Daily Allowances, Ninth Revised Edition, The National Academy of Sciences, page 160, 1980). Only 1-2% of most organic chromium compounds are assimilated into the body.",

Nos. 4,315,927 and Re. 33,988 disclose that when selected essential metals, including chromium, are administered to mammals as exogenously synthesized coordination complexes of picolinic acid, they are directly available for absorption without competition from other metals. Describes therein are compositions and methods for selectively supplementing the essential metals in the human diet and for facilitating absorption of these metals by intestinal cells. These complexes are safe, inexpensive, biocompatible, and easy to produce.

U.S. Pat.

                                "Nicotinic acid and picolinic acid form coordination complexes with monovalent, divalent and trivalent metal ions and facilitate the absorption of these metals by transporting them across intestinal cells and into the bloodstream. Chromium absorption in rats following oral administration of CrCl3 was facilitated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin and indomethacin. (Davis et al. (1995) J. Nutrition Res. 15:202-210; Kamath et al. (1997) J. Nutrition 127:478-482). These drugs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase which converts arachidonic acid to various prostaglandins, resulting in inhibition of intestinal mucus formation and lowering of intestinal pH which facilitates chromium absorption.",

The present embodiments disclosed herein address this need by providing a safe, inexpensive, drug-free therapeutic agent, and methods of administering the same. Different forms of chromium exhibit different and unpredictable absorption and activity profiles in vivo. In order for a chromium complex to exert a biological effect in vivo, it must (1) be absorbed by the body; (2) be absorbed in the right cells (tissues or organs); and (3) must be released from the complex once within the cells. The fact that a particular chromium complex may be absorbed by certain cells does not necessarily guarantee a biological effect. Whether a particular form of chromium will be effectively absorbed, let alone whether the chromium will be released from the complex once absorbed to exert any physiological effect is unpredictable."
