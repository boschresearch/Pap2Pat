    "title": "Anti-diabetic potential of chromium histidinate in diabetic retinopathy rats",
    "date": "2015-02-05",
    "abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is commonly used as a complementary medicine for diabetes mellitus. Several studies suggest that Cr intakes may improve glucose metabolism and decrease oxidative stress. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effects of chromium histidinate (CrHis) supplementation using a range of reliable biomarkers of oxidative damage and histopathological changes in rats with diabetic retinopathy.Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin [(STZ), 55 mg/kg] by intraperitoneal injection in male Long-Evans rats. Three weeks after STZ injection, rats were divided into four groups, namely, untreated normal controls, normal rats receiving CrHis (110 \u03bcg/kg/day); untreated diabetics and diabetics treated with CrHis (110 \u03bcg/kg/day) orally for 12 weeks.In the untreated diabetic group, levels of serum glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC) and retina malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased, while expressions of retina insulin, and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) and level of serum insulin were decreased. CrHis supplementation was found to reduce the levels of glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol and MDA and to improve the GLUT1, GLUT3 and insulin expressions in STZ-induced diabetic rats. CrHis prevents the changes in the expressions of GLUT1, GLUT3 and insulin and the level of MDA in the retina tissue, confirming the protective effect of CrHis supplementation against the retinopathy caused by STZ. Histopathologic findings suggest that the CrHis-treated diabetic group had normal retinal tissue appearance compared with the untreated diabetic group.These results verify that CrHis has critical beneficial effects against retinal complications. Although detailed studies are required for the evaluation of the exact mechanism of the ameliorative effects of CrHis against diabetic complications, these preliminary experimental findings demonstrate that CrHis exhibits antidiabetic effects in a rat model of diabetic retinopathy by regulating the glucose metabolism and suppressing retinal tissue damage.",

                "Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in working-age population. The pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy is complex and multifactorial. The pathogenic process involves intricate interactions between oxidative stress and hyperglycemia [1,2]. Oxidative stress, increasing in diabetic retina during hyperglycemia, is linked to the augmented retinal basement membrane thickening, which is the hallmark of microangiopathy seen in diabetic retinal disease. In addition, the retina is the neurosensorial tissue of the eye and is extremely rich in polyunsaturated lipid membranes. This feature makes it especially sensitive to reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Diabetes mellitus increases oxidative stress and induces vascular leakage and increased retinal vascular permeability, perhaps causing macular edema which correlates with vision loss in diabetic retinopathy patients [3-5]. A strong association between hyperglycemia-induced retinal oxidative stress and the development of retinal histopathology has been supported by studies in diabetic animals treated with multiple trace elements. Certain trace elements supplementation can inhibit diabetes-induced retinal abnormalities associated with increased oxidative stress and can be directly and/or indirectly regulated by their interrelated homeostatic mechanisms to ensure normal retinal function [6].",
                "In a high energy-demanding tissue such as retina, the regulation of glucose uptake and its utilization is important for the maintenance of normal retinal function. It is well known that glucose uptake is regulated by glucose transporter proteins (GLUTs) and all mammalian cells contain one or more members of this GLUT protein family. Among these transporters the GLUT3 and GLUT1 isoforms have been expressed in retinal cells [7,8]. Glucose uptake into retina cells occurs across the blood-retinal barrier via the GLUT1 and GLUT3 transporters. Glucose uptake into cells can vary among cell types, and such differences might be important in determining which cells are adversely affected by hyperglycemia [7].",
                "The incidence of diabetes mellitus is associated with various events such as obesity, increasing age, physical inactivity etc. Furthermore, certain nutritional deficiencies have also been associated with a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus [8,9]. Chromium (Cr) deficiency has been associated with elevated blood glucose levels and diabetes mellitus [9]. Chromium is required for optimal insulin activity and normal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism [9,10]. Moreover, Cr improves glucose utilization through cellular signal transduction and glucose transporters. Results from the trials show that Cr supplementation in patients [10] and animals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes can improve both glucose and insulin metabolism [11]; in contrast to some studies rejecting the importance of Cr in treatment of type 2 diabetes [12]. For example, Kleefstra et al. [12] reported that no significant differences were found over time between the control and Cr treatment in the form of chromium yeast groups for fasting plasma glucose levels, blood pressure, body fat percentage, weight, lipid profile, and insulin resistance. However, as a novel Cr chelate, chromium histidinate (CrHis) is absorbed better than other forms of Cr compounds tested in human subjects [13]. Anderson et al. [13] reported that that humans absorbed an average 3.1 mcg of Cr from the CrHis complex, compared to 1.8 mcg from chromium picolinate (CrPic), 0.4 mcg from chromium chloride and 0.2 mcg from chromium polynicotinate. However, the exact mechanism by which supplemental CrHis exerts hypoglycemic action in diabetic diabetic retinopathy has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study was specifically planned to evaluate the effect of CrHis, a form of Cr developed to enhance stability and absorption of Cr supplementation, on metabolic risk factors and to determine the effect on the retinal tissue damage status of diabetic retinopathy rats."

Serum glucose concentrations were measured by using ACCU-Chek Active (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Serum insulin levels were measured with the Rat Insulin Kit (Linco Research, St Charles, MO) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Elx-800, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) were measured by diagnostic kits (Sigma Diagnostics, St Louis, MO). Blood glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was also measured by routine kit (Alfabiotech, Milano, Italy) using the autoanalyzer. After rats were sacrificed, both eyes were enucleated and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C for the measurements of MDA, GLUT1, GLUT3 and insulin.

                "Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes. It remains a major cause of vision impairment or blindness in the world and high blood sugar level is considered the chief instigator in its development. The pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy are rather obscure. Many hyperglycemia-induced metabolic abnormalities are implicated in its pathogenesis, such as increased oxidative stress, and increased advanced glycation endproduct formation and other tissue proteins, which are observed during long-term hyperglycemia [6]. The retina has a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the highest uptake of oxygen, which are vulnerable to lipid peroxidative damage. Free radical oxidation of the retinal photoreceptors adversely affects visual processing after the loss of lipoprotein membrane content [3,4]. Animal studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress, increasing in retina during hyperglycemia, is linked to the retinal capillary basement membrane thickening, which is one of the earliest abnormalities of the microangiopathy seen in diabetic retinopathy [4,5]. Hyperglycemia is generally recognized as a primary cause of diabetic complications and is associated with increased serum level of MDA [3,17]. In regards to diabetes mellitus, MDA levels are increased, indicating increasing lipid peroxidation. Diabetes induced oxidative stress can be responsible for the development of diabetic complications [17]. Trace elements and oxidative stress are associated with glycemic control and diabetic complications and trace elements supplementations such as Cr may help diabetic patients to slow the progression of this threatening complication of diabetes [9-11]. These findings were supported by a significant increase in MDA levels in retina tissue of diabetic retinopathy rats compared to other groups in our study. However, levels of MDA were significantly lower in the CrHis administration group and these research results were consistent with those obtained in other studies and in agreement that supplementation to diet of some essential trace metals such as Cr may play a role in the improvement of diabetes mellitus complications.",
                "The risk of loss in visual acuity was correlated with the degree of retinal hard exudates, reducing serum lipid levels in patients with diabetic retinopathy [18]. The most common lipoprotein pattern in diabetes, also known as diabetic dyslipidemia, consists of an increase in triglyceride levels and decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [19]. This is consistent with the study carried out by Yan et al. [20] to elucidate the relationship between diabetes and increase in serum cholesterol level. Faulkner et al. [21] clearly showed that the control of impaired glycaemic, which is defined by HbA1c, was proportionally related with degree of dyslipidemia. In addition, Cefalu [22] found that Cr supplementation improved glycemic control of type 2 diabetics by decreasing HbA1c% concentration. Jain et al. [23] also recorded that Cr is a key mineral for protection from heart diseases in streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats by reducing cholesterol levels in blood. In parallel with previous research, our study demonstrated that CrHis supplementation lowered total cholesterol level, and improved the HbA1c level in diabetic rats.",
                "As one of the essential trace elements, trivalent cr plays a significant role in the regulation of glucose and insulin metabolism. Chromium is biologically active as part of an oligopeptide\u2013chromodulin (low-molecular-weight chromium binding substance)\u2013potentiating the effect of insulin by facilitating insulin binding to receptors at the cell surface. With Cr acting as a cofactor of insulin, Cr activity in the organism is parallel to insulin functions [24]. Cefalu et al. [25] stated that Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes receiving Cr experienced significant improvements in HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, 2-h glucose, and fasting and 2-h insulin. Similarly, Sahin et al. [9] reported that supplementary CrPic reduced blood glucose, total cholesterol levels and free fatty acid concentration and increased serum insulin levels and the composite insulin sensitivity index in rats. These results were also in agreement with Anderson et al. [26]. In addition Chen et al. [27] indicated that Cr supplementation has significant positive effects on glucose and insulin metabolism in patients with diabetes. This agreed with results of several authors such as Ravina et al. [28] who demonstrated that 10\u00a0days of treatment with CrPic (200\u00a0\u03bcg/Cr day) significantly increased insulin sensitivity in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes and also enabled reductions in dosages of insulin and/or oral antidiabetic drugs in these patients. In the present study, the beneficial effect of Cr supplementation in diabetic retinopathy rats was observed in improvements in blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Complications of diabetic retinopathy were also shown to slow significantly while the same trend was observed for the carbohydrate metabolic profile as reflected in improved values of insulin expression and glucose transporter proteins.",
                "Chromium has consistently indicated improvement in glucose transport in various tissues both in vitro and in animal models. Several mechanistic studies have demonstrated improvements in insulin receptor/postreceptor signaling, leading to enhanced activity of GLUTs. Interestingly, Cr can directly bind insulin, making the insulin more stable and possibly prolong its duration of action. Chromium treatment also helps the translocation of GLUTs and increases membrane fluidity by reducing the plasma membrane cholesterol [29]. The retina tissue has a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids and high metabolic rates that require a constant and abundant supply of glucose from the circulation to meet their metabolic demands. Therefore, glucose uptake by this tissue plays an important role in determining glycemic control. In the retina, glucose is transported by GLUT1 [30] and GLUT3 [31] across the blood\u2013retinal barrier. GLUT1 levels in the retina increase in relation to glucose transport and metabolism and tissue growth, whereas GLUT3 levels in neuroretina increase in relation to functional neuronal activity [32]. In the retina, endothelial cells express GLUT-1 [33], whereas neurons express GLUT3 [32]. Some studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of retinal disease. Klip et al. [34] indicated that whole-body glucose uptake is decreased in streptozocin-induced diabetic animals and in type 2 diabetic humans. In the diabetic retinopathy model, the observed lower expressions of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the retina indicate the cellular biological properties similar to those of a combination of neurons and endothelial cells. Moreover, CrHis treatment effectively reversed this decrease in the retina. Increased GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressions in retina tissues upon hyperglycemia may be a response to compensate glucose need (Figure\u00a01). Chromium serves as a cofactor for insulin action and enhances insulin signaling in animal models [35]. As examples, Cr supplementation has alleviated insulin resistance, enhanced intracellular insulin signaling in high fat diet/STZ rats, depressed lipolysis in adipocytes and inhibited gluconeogenesis in rats. Another study also reported an inverse association of Cr intake with fasting insulin level and several studies have reported benefits of chromium supplementation on insulin sensitivity in adults with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus [9]. Chromium supplementation can alleviate blurred vision and improve poor insulin binding and impaired glucose intolerance in human and animals [36]. These observations suggest that CrPic supplementation improves insulin sensitivity and improves retinal function by recovering retinal chromium concentration. Chromium can modulate the activity of insulin by increasing the insulin-sensitive cell receptors or binding activity and enhancing intracellular insulin signaling activity [37]. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake in various tissues by inducing the translocation of GLUT from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane [38]. The hypoglycemic effect of trivalent chromium was reported under insulin-deficient conditions [39] and exhibited significant antidiabetic potential in STZ-induced diabetes in rats. Our findings demonstrate that diabetic retinopathy syndrome in rats is associated with a reduction in retina tissue insulin levels, which reflects impairment in glucose uptake. This is further supported by other blot test examinations of retina tissues. Treatment of diabetic retinopathy rats with CrHis succeeded to normalize the lower retina insulin level. This may explain the reported effectiveness of CrHis treatment on the retina tissue levels of insulin."

CrHis supplementation offer improvements to markers of disease risk, including hyperglycemia insulin sensitivity, and increased oxidative stress. These findings are encouraging and warrant further clinical trials of this promising CrHis supplementation."
