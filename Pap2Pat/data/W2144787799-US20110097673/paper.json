    "title": "Chemical Looping Combustion with Different Types of Liquid Fuels",
    "date": "2011-02-22",
    "abstract": "CLC is a new promising combustion process for CO2 capture with less or even no energy penalty compared to other processes. Up to now, most of the work performed on CLC was conducted with gaseous or solid fuels, using methane and coal and/or pet coke. Liquid fuels such as heavy fuels resulting from oil distillation or conversion may also be interesting feedstocks to consider. However, liquid fuels are challenging feedstock to deal with in fluidized beds. The objective of the present work is therefore to investigate the feasibility of liquid feed injection and contact with oxygen carrier in CLC conditions in order to conduct partial or complete combustion of hydrocarbons. A batch experimental fluidized bed set-up was developed to contact alternatively oxygen carrier with liquid fuels or air. The 20 mm i.d. fluidized bed reactor was filled up with 45 g of NiAl0.44O1.67 and pulses of 1-2 g of liquid were injected in the bed at high temperatures up to 950\u02daC. Different feedstocks have been injected, from dodecane to heavy fuel oils No.2. Results show that, during the reduction period, it is possible to convert all the fuel injected and there is no coke remaining on particles at the end of the reduction step. Depending upon oxygen available in the bed, either full combustion or partial combustion can be achieved. Similar results were found with different liquid feeds, despite their different composition and properties.",

                "Over the last 10-15 years, chemical looping routes have started to be investigated in order to provide clean and efficient solutions for several applications such as combustion and hydrogen production. CLC is one of the promising route for CO 2 capture since no specific separation of O 2 from air nor CO 2 from flue gas is required, resulting in expected much lower energy penalties. The chemical looping concept is based on the use of Oxygen Carriers (OC) materials with oxidation-reduction cycles that can either oxidize or reduce feedstocks. Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) is a flameless combustion technology where there is no direct contact between air and fuel. In combustion, CO 2 rich effluents can be directly produced, enabling subsequent CO 2 transportation and storage. Theoretical analyses of the technology indicate that its use results in increased power efficiency compared to regular combustion [1].",
                "This combustion process is divided into two steps (see Fig. 1): reduction and oxidation. In the reduction step, fuel is oxidized by reduction with a metal oxide via the following reactions:",
                "(where Me x O y is the metal oxide, and Me x O y- 1 is the reduced metal oxide). In the oxidation step, the reduced metal oxide is reoxidized by contact with air via the following reaction:",
                "The net result of these two steps is the direct combustion of the fuel gases with oxygen:",
                "Most of the power plants in the world today burn coal and gas. However, power plants using liquid fuels such as heavy fuel oils still represent a significant portion of the market in the range of 10-15% worldwide. Furthermore, based on the increasing production of very heavy oils and oils sands, very heavy unconverted hydrocarbon liquid feedstocks may be available in the future for energy production.",
                "Up to now, most of the researches in Chemical Looping Combustion have focused on the use of gaseous fuels [2][3] or solid fuels [4][5][6][7]. It was found that CLC combustion with solid fuels is more challenging than CLC reactions with gas fuels. Indeed, with solid fuels, reaction mechanisms are resulting first, from a gasification step and then, from combustion of the syngas produced in the first step. The gasification step is rather slow compared to syngas combustion and, most likely, remains the limiting step [8].",
                "There are a lot of challenges to face when considering the combustion of liquid fuels. Some of the difficulties may be related to the fuel injection at high temperature in the fluidized bed. Coke may also deposit on the OC materials, which may limit the oxygen release from the material. Furthermore, it may be difficult to separate coked OC materials from non coked OC materials when returning particles from the fuel reactor to the air reactor. However, up to now, there is no detailed experimental work reported in the literature concerning CLC with liquid fuels."

K-type chrome/alumel thermocouples are used to measure continuously temperature of the oxygen carrier bed. In standard conditions, the bed is filled up with 45 g of OC material that is preheated in an inert atmosphere (N 2 ) to the desired experimental temperature and then exposed to air to ensure that particles are fully oxidized before the reduction period.",

However, with this system, the quantity of liquids injected in the bed with this configuration was not very accurate nor reproducible. Carbon balance during experiments ranged typically 70-75%. In order to compare results obtained with different feedstocks, an improved system was developed, shown as the B configuration in Figure 3 with B1 and B2 sequences was used. Carbon mass balance during one experiment with this new system improved a lot and typically ranges between 90-105% except for the heavier feedstock tested (Fuel 2, see Tab. 1) where carbon mass balance is in the range of 80-90%.

Furthermore, due to vaporization, pyrolysis, gasification and combustion reactions, the volumetric expansion of gases in the reactor is very large during the reduction. Gas flowrates and pressure change rapidly and are not easy to estimate accurately."
