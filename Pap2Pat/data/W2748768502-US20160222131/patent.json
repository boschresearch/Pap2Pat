    "title": "ATRX AS A COMPANION DIAGNOSTIC FOR CDK4 INHIBITORS",
    "date": "2016-04-21 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the use of one or more biomarkers to evaluate the likelihood that a CDK4 inhibitor would produce an anti-cancer effect in a subject. It is based, at least in part, on the discovery that cancer cells expressing ATRX prior to treatment are more likely to undergo cellular senescence in response to treatment with a CDK4 inhibitor. It is also based, at least in part, on the discovery that ATRX is phosphorylated in cancer cells that are not as responsive to CDK4 inhibitor therapy. Accordingly, in non-limiting embodiments, the present invention provides for methods, compositions, and kits for a companion diagnostic for CDK4 inhibitors, and in particular, to the use of ATRX expression as a biomarker for determining the likelihood that a cancer can be successfully and/or unsuccessfully treated by CDK4 inhibition.",

                        "CDK4 inhibition therapies are currently in numerous U.S. clinical trials for several cancers including liposarcoma, ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, lung cancer, multiple myeloma and glioblastoma. Although patients typically are pre-screened for genetic lesions that would render their disease responsive to the drug (i.e., Rb protein expression, CDK4 amplification or loss of CDKN2A depending on the trial), responsiveness to therapy is nonetheless uncertain. For example, in the Phase II trial for liposarcoma carried out at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, approximately 66% of patients achieved progression-free survival that met the trial criteria, while 3% of patients achieved RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) response. The remaining 31% of patients had progressive disease while being treated with the drug, indicating that predicting the efficacy of these drugs on patient outcome is problematic.",
                        "Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) is encoded by the atrx gene. ATRX is a SWI/SNF helicase/ATPase that can regulate gene expression via chromatin remodeling and is associated with pericentric and telomeric heterochromatin (McDowell et al. PNAS 1999; Eustermann et al. NSMB 2011). Its primary clinical indication is mutations in the mental retardation syndrome \u03b1-thalassemia/MR, X-linked (ATRX syndrome) (Picketts D J et al. Am J Human Genet 1996). Although ATRX can interact with several proteins that are involved in senescence including PML bodies (Xue et al. PNAS 2003; Luciani et al. J. Cell Science 2006), HP1 proteins (McDowell et al. PNAS 1999; Eustermann et al. NSMB 2011) and macroH2A (Ratnakumar et al. Genes and Dev 2012), ATRX has never been directly associated with senescence. Studies have shown that ATRX negatively regulates macroH2A (a facilitator of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci formation) incorporation into chromatin (Ratnakumar et al. Genes and Dev 2012)."

The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized ATRX is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to ATRX, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized ATRX is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized ATRX is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to ATRX.

                                "Senescence is perceived as a favorable clinical outcome due to its ability to inhibit tumor progression. Rb-positive liposarcoma cell lines have the capacity to undergo either cell cycle arrest or cell cycle arrest with activation of a senescence program in response to CDK4 inhibition. In soft tissue sarcomas such as liposarcoma, as well as other types of tumors (reviewed in Johnson J E and Broccoli D, Curr Opin Oncol 2007), the phenomenon known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which is a mechanism by which cells maintain their telomeres independent of telomerase, is quite common. ALT is used by cancer cells as a mechanism of immortalization independent of telomerase activity.",
                                "To determine whether ALT plays a role in senescence induced by treatment with the CDK4 inhibitor, PD0332991, ALT was measured in responder and non-responder cancer cell lines. Cell lines that under growth arrest are referred to as non-responder cells and cells that undergo growth arrest that is associated with the induction of senescence are referred to as responder cells. ALT can be detected either via accumulation of high-molecular weight telomeric DNA in the terminal restriction fragment (TRF) southern blotting assay or by the presence of a few large, brightly staining foci as measured by telomeric FISH (Henson et al. Clinical Cancer Res 2005, Slatter et al. American Journal of Pathology 2010). ALT, as measured either by telomere FISH (FIG. 6) or by telomere restriction fragment length (FIG. 5), did not correlate with the definition of a responder in any of the cell types analyzed.",
                                "ALT-positive cells are further characterized by a loss or mutation of Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) protein expression (in 90% of ALT-positive cells), a failed capacity to repair double strand breaks and elongated telomeres (Lovejoy et al. PLoS Genetics 2012; Heaphy et al. Science 2011). To determine if ATRX expression is altered in responder cells compared to non-responder cells, ATRX protein was analyzed. ATRX was found to be exclusively detected using the Bethyl antibody by Western blot in the responder liposarcoma cell lines, LS8817, LS141 and LS0082, and in the breast and glioma cell lines, U87MG, U251, SNB19, DBTRG-05MG, MDA453, T-47D, ZR-75-1 and MCF7 (FIGS. 1 and 7). No correlation was observed between loss of ATRX protein and the ALT phenotype, as measured by both TRF and telomeric-FISH in the responder and non-responder cells (FIGS. 5 and 6). Without being bound to a specific theory, these results suggest that ATRX detected by the Bethyl antibody might be involved in the senescence pathway induced by treatment with a CDK4 inhibitor, and may be acting in a way that was unrelated to ALT.",
                                "To determine if ATRX plays a role in the senescence pathway induced by treatment with a CDK4 inhibitor, the expression of ATRX was genetically manipulated in the responder cell line, LS8817. Knockdown of ATRX (FIG. 2) was performed in LS8817 cells that were treated with PD0332991. The presence of ATRX in scrambled control shRNA (shSCR)-treated cells and the ATRX shRNA-treated cells was detected by the Bethyl antibody. The accumulation of perinuclear associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) shSCR-treated cells and the ATRX shRNA-treated cells was measured (FIG. 3). In LS8817 cells infected with shRNA directed to ATRX, the number of SA-\u03b2-gal positive cells observed after exposure to PD0332991 for seven days was greatly reduced as compared to PD0332991-treated LS8817 cells infected with shSCR, without serious consequences to cell proliferation as measured by BrdU (FIG. 3). Abrogating ATRX expression, as detected by the D5 antibody, prevented the loss of MDM2 that has been shown to accompany induction of senescence following treatment with PD0332991 (FIGS. 3 and 8A). As shown in FIG. 8B, reducing ATRX levels in the responder cell line L8817 prevented CDK4 inhibition-induced acceleration of MDM2 protein turnover (FIG. 8B). To determine if ATRX was also downstream of MDM2 loss, we subsequently infected the ATRX deficient cells with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs that targeted MDM2. In the responder cell line, LS8817, accumulation of SA-\u03b2-gal was still compromised even though the level of MDM2 was reduced (FIG. 4A). Similar results were seen in the LS8313 non-responder cells-ATRX knockdown prevented senescence induced by knocking down MDM2 (FIG. 4B). Thus, a form of ATRX was required for both PD0332991-induced loss of MDM2, and downstream of MDM2 loss to establish a senescent state."

                                "We have shown that ATRX was important for an INK4A- and p53-independent senescence program. First, a form of ATRX detectable by immunoblot using the Bethyl antibody was present in the responder cells and not in the non-responder cells. Reducing all forms of ATRX in responder and non-responder cells does not interfere with the ability of PD0332991 to induce cell cycle exit, but it does prevent the down-regulation of MDM2 in responders. Flow might ATRX contribute to MDM2 turnover? ATRX interacts with DAXX (Lewis et al., 2010). DAXX is required to bridge HAUSP, a deubiquitinase, to the MDM2 complex (Tang et al., 2006). In this MDM2/DAXX/HAUSP complex, MDM2 autoubiquitination is reduced and ubiquitination of other substrates is favored (Li et al., 2004; Meulmeester et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2006). Proteins that interact with DAXX can disrupt this complex. For example, upon DNA damage the activation of the DNA damage responsive kinases (ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK) enhance the ability of RASSF1A to interact with DAXX disrupting the MDM2/DAXX/HAUSP complex. This leads to MDM2 autoubiquitination and turnover (Song et al., 2008). ATRX may use an analogous mechanism in responder cells. Triggered by the inhibition of CDK4, ATRX could compete for DAXX driving the autoubiquitination and degradation of MDM2. Non-responder cells lack this form of ATRX and thus MDM2 would be stabilized. Given that the immunoblot detectable form is one type of ATRX in cells, we suspect that regulation may be more complex than simple titration and the relationship between ATRX and the MDM2/DAXX/HAUSP complex and its modulation by CDK4 inhibition warrants further investigation.",
                                "Secondly, reducing all forms of ATRX in both responder and non-responder cells prevents senescence following the loss of MDM2. This indicates that ATRX is required downstream for senescence. ATRX/DAXX facilitates the deposition of histone H3.3 into telomeric nucleosomes and pericentric heterochromatin (Clynes et al., 2013; Drane et al., 2010). There are other histone H3.3 chaperones, and at least one, the HIRA/ASF1 containing complex, is involved in the deposition of H3.3 in senescent cells (Banumathy et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). Recently, however, HIRA/ASF1 was shown to operate largely in cycling cells (Ray-Gallet et al., 2011) and many of the target genes are transcriptionally active (Pchelintsev et al., 2013), but the HIRA complex and histone H3.3 are involved in chromatin silencing in some situations as well (Sherwood et al., 1993; van der Heijden et al., 2007). Thus, these histone chaperone pathway could contribute to distinct local histone H3.3 enrichment in different contexts (Goldberg et al., 2010). ATRX/DAXX may play a significant role in the pathway induced by loss of MDM2."

In the responder cell line, unmethylation and dimethylation at amino acid R2474 of ATRX was detected (FIG. 12). Dimethylation at amino acid R2480 of ATRX was detected (FIG. 12). In non-responder cells, there was no evidence for acetylation at amino acid K2490 of ATRX (FIG. 12). However, phosphorylation of amino acid S2487 was detected in non-responder cells (FIG. 12).
