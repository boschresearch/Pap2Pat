    "title": "GREB1 induced by Wnt signaling promotes development of hepatoblastoma by suppressing TGF\u03b2 signaling",
    "date": "2019-08-28",
    "abstract": "The \u03b2-catenin mutation is frequently observed in hepatoblastoma (HB), but the underlying mechanism by which Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling induces HB tumor formation is unknown. Here we show that expression of growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) depends on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HB patients. GREB1 is localized to the nucleus where it binds Smad2/3 in a competitive manner with p300 and inhibits TGF\u03b2 signaling, thereby promoting HepG2 HB cell proliferation. Forced expression of \u03b2-catenin, YAP, and c-Met induces HB-like mouse liver tumor (BYM mice), with an increase in GREB1 expression and HB markers. Depletion of GREB1 strongly suppresses marker gene expression and HB-like liver tumorigenesis, and instead enhances TGF\u03b2 signaling in BYM mice. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides for GREB1 suppress the formation of HepG2 cell-induced tumors and HB-like tumors in vivo. We propose that GREB1 is a target molecule of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and required for HB progression.",

                "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation during development and tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation is associated with numerous diseases1. In physiological conditions, Wnt stabilizes \u03b2-catenin by inhibiting the Axin function, and stabilized \u03b2-catenin is then translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to transcription factors, T-cell factor (TCF) and lymphocyte enhancer factor\u00a0(LEF), leading to expression of various genes2.Mutations in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling components occur frequently in cancer and result in constitutive \u03b2-catenin accumulation3. For example, the APC gene is mutated in 70\u201380% of colorectal cancer cases and the \u03b2-catenin gene (CTNNB1) is mutated in 15\u201320% of cases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the \u03b2-catenin and Axin genes are mutated in around 30% and 5\u201310% of cases, respectively4. Although rates of active mutations of the \u03b2-catenin gene in adult HCC vary among tumors associated with different etiologies, a high rate (50\u201390%) of mutations in the \u03b2-catenin gene was found in hepatoblastoma (HB)5.",
                "HB is the predominant hepatic neoplasm in infants and young children, with an incidence of a few cases per 1 million children6. HB differs from HCC by distinct morphological patterns reminiscent of hepatoblasts and their arrangement in the developing liver7. Clinically, advances in surgery and postoperative chemotherapy have improved outcomes for HB, resulting in 5-year survival rates averaging 82%6. However, there are still aggressive forms that remain difficult to treat. Therefore, new treatments are needed for advanced-stage tumors, and an understanding of HB pathobiology is necessary for developing targeted therapies.",
                "Growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) is a gene induced by estrogen in MCF7 breast cancer cells8, and expressed in estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1)-positive breast cancer cells but not in ER\u03b1-negative cells. ER\u03b1 binds to the promoter regions of the GREB1 gene, and expresses GREB1, which\u2014in turn\u2014interacts directly with ER\u03b1 and activates its transcriptional activity9. Knockdown and overexpression of GREB1 suppresses and promotes proliferation of breast cancer cells, respectively10. The GREB1 promoter region has an androgen response element, GREB1 is induced by androgen in androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cells11. GREB1 knockdown also inhibits the proliferation of AR-positive prostate cancer cells. Thus, GREB1 could be a potential therapeutic target for hormone-sensitive cancers. However, it remains unclear whether GREB1 expression is involved in tumor formation in cancers that are not hormone-sensitive.",
                "In this study, we identified GREB1 as an uncharacterized target gene expressed by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, and found that GREB1 expression is critical for HB cell proliferation. GREB1 was frequently detected together with \u03b2-catenin in the tumor lesions of HB patients, and GREB1 inhibited TGF\u03b2 signaling, and thereby promoting HB cell proliferation. In addition, GREB1 depletion inhibited HB cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Here we propose a function of GREB1 in HB cells and the possibility of a therapeutic strategy for HB using amido-bridged nucleic acid (AmNA)-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target GREB1."

                        "To clarify the mechanism of tumorigenesis of HB, we screened uncharacterized downstream target genes of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HepG2 HB cells, which were established from liver tumors with characteristics of HB and had a truncated mutation of the \u03b2-catenin gene at exons 3 and 45,12. RNA-sequencing analyses were performed in HepG2 cells transfected with control or \u03b2-catenin siRNA. A total of 76 candidate genes were selected based on the criterion that they were abundantly expressed (FPKM\u2009\u2265\u20093) and that levels decreased by more than threefold in \u03b2-catenin-depleted cells compared with control cells (Fig.\u00a01a). Whether the candidate genes possess the DNA-binding sites of TCF7L2 (TCF4) was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in HepG2 cells using a gene set of ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding Site Profiles (TCF7L2_HepG2_hg19_1), and the criteria identified 11 genes (Fig.\u00a01a and Supplementary Table\u00a01). Most of the selected genes, including NKD1, LGR5, SP5, ZNRF3, RNF43, Axin2, CCND1, and DKK1, were well-known target genes of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Therefore, GREB1 was further analyzed because whether GREB1 acts downstream of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has not yet been established.Fig. 1GREB1 is a downstream target gene of Wnt signaling in HB. a Downstream target genes of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HB cells were identified by RNA-sequencing analysis. The heatmap of genes which has changed in expression in control and \u03b2-catenin knockdown cells and some candidate genes are shown in the lower panel. b Chromatin from HepG2 cells was immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. The putative TCF4-binding region (\u2212443 to \u2212448) of the precipitated GREB1 gene was analyzed by PCR with region-specific primers. c HepG2 cells were transfected with control or \u03b2-catenin siRNA and real-time PCR analysis for GREB1 mRNA expression was performed. The obtained results are expressed as fold changes compared with control cells and the results shown are means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Whole lysates of control and \u03b2-catenin knockdown HepG2 cells were probed with the indicated antibodies. d HB tissues (n\u2009=\u200911) were stained with anti-GREB1 antibody and hematoxylin. Percentages of GREB1-positive cases in the tumor lesions and nontumor regions are shown in the right panels. Areas that stained positive for GREB1 were classified as indicated. Solid and dashed squares show enlarged images. e HB specimens were stained with the indicated antibodies and hematoxylin. Solid and dashed squares show the region where \u03b2-catenin staining is high and low, respectively. f GREB1 gene expression in 5 nontumor and 50 HB cases, which were obtained from public mRNA profile dataset of HB, was analyzed. Results shown are scatter plots with means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. **P\u2009<\u20090.01, t test. g Scatter plots showing correlation between target genes of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway (Y-axis) and GREB1 gene expression (X-axis) were obtained from the dataset of HB.

                        "The ChIP assay revealed that TCF4 and \u03b2-catenin form a complex with the putative TCF4-binding site in the 5\u2032-upstream region \u2212443 to \u2212448 of the human GREB1 gene (Fig.\u00a01b). \u03b2-Catenin knockdown decreased GREB1 expression, as well as Axin2, at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells (Fig.\u00a01c). However, GREB1 expression was unaffected by treatment with the ER degrader ICI.182.780 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). A GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021, which activates the \u03b2-catenin pathway and increases Axin2 mRNA expression, induced GREB1 expression in a bipotential mouse embryonic liver (BMEL) cell line and \u03b2-catenin knockdown suppressed GREB1 expression in Huh6 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b, c), another HB cell line that harbors G34V somatic activating mutation in CTNNB1 gene13 and expresses GREB1 less than HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). In ER-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells, GREB1 expression was dramatically decreased by treatment with ICI.182.780 and also reduced by in response to CHIR99021 (Supplementary Fig. 1e), indicating that HepG2 and MCF7 cells regulate GREB1 expression in a different manner.\u00a0Furthermore, CHIR99021 treatment did not induce GREB1 expression in HLE, SNU387, SNU449, and Huh7, human HCC cell lines in which GREB1 was little expressed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f). Taken together, these results suggest that GREB1 is a specific downstream target gene of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HB and immature liver progenitor cells.",
                        "HB is a rare disease and 11 cases were analyzed immunohistochemically (Supplementary Table\u00a02). GREB1 was detected in the nucleus of tumor lesions of 10 HB cases (90.9%), while it was not detected in the nontumor regions (Fig.\u00a01d). \u03b2-catenin was detected in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of the tumor lesions of nine cases (81.8%), and all nine cases were also positive for GREB1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01g and Supplementary Table\u00a02). The region-specific expression pattern of GREB1 in HB tissue tends to be positively correlated with the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in consecutive sections (Fig.\u00a01e). There were two types of tumors in HB tissues. One showed solid structures with unpolarized cells, and the other had tubular structures with polarized cells. GREB1 was specifically expressed in the former tumors (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01h).",
                        "GREB1 gene expression and its correlation with expression of target genes of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in HB were analyzed using a public dataset of HB patients (GEO ID: gse75271)14. Both parameters were available for 50 tumor lesions and five nontumor regions in HB cases. In the tumor lesions, GREB1 mRNA was significantly upregulated compared with the nontumor regions (Fig.\u00a01f). In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between expression levels of GREB1 and those of target genes of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, such as Axin2, DKK1, NKD1, and glutamine synthetase (GS) in HB (Fig.\u00a01g). However, expression of target genes of ER signaling, including PRLR, and XBP1, did not significantly correlate with GREB1 expression (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01i). These results support the idea that activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, but not that of ER signaling, induces GREB1 expression in HB patients.",
                        "The public dataset of HB patients also revealed that GREB1 expression is unchanged between HB cases with WT CTNNB1 and those with CTNNB1 mutations and deletions at exons 3 and 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01j)14. Expression of \u03b2-catenin target genes such as GS and LGR5 expressions was also unchanged in HB cases regardless of the presence or absence of CTNNB1 abnormalities (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01j). Therefore, GREB1 expression in HB is correlated with \u03b2-catenin signaling activity but not always be associated with mutations and deletions at exons 3 and 4 of CTNNB1. Other CTNNB1 mutations or CTNNB1 mutation-independent activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling could occur in these cases."

To examine the roles of GREB1 in HB cell proliferation, GREB1 was depleted by two different siRNAs, which target the 3\u2032-UTR (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). GREB1 knockdown did not affect expression of \u03b2-catenin and Axin2 at protein levels or that of PRLR and XBP1 at mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b, c), suggesting that GREB1 does not function upstream of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and ER in HB cells. GREB1 knockdown decreased HepG2 cell proliferation using two-dimensional (2D) culture conditions, and exogenous GREB1 expression rescued the GREB1-knockdown phenotypes (Fig.\u00a02a).Fig. 2GREB1 expression is involved in HB cell proliferation in vitro. a HepG2 cells expressing mock or GREB1 were transfected with control or two independent GREB1 siRNAs and cultured on a 2D plastic dish for the indicated numbers of days.

                        "When HepG2 cells were grown using 3D culture conditions with Matrigel, GREB1 knockdown reduced the area of tumor sphere (Fig.\u00a02b). Conversely, micro-lumens were frequently observed in GREB1-depleted spheres, suggesting that HepG2 cells are transformed into a differentiated state with epithelial polarization (Fig.\u00a02b). These results are consistent with the observation that GREB1 was specifically expressed in the solid structure tumors with unpolarized cells in HB tissues (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a01h). GREB1 knockdown also decreased expression of a hepatoblast marker AFP, an imprinted gene PEG3, and a HB marker DLK1 in HepG2 cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Consistently, there were strong positive correlations between expression levels of GREB1 and those of DLK1 and TACSTD1 (another HB marker gene) in HB (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d). Furthermore, GREB1 overexpression in HepG2 and Huh6 cells promoted cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e,f).",
                        "GREB1 knockdown also decreased protein expression of cell cycle markers, including cyclinA, cyclinB, and phosphorylated histoneH3 (Fig.\u00a02d). The public dataset revealed a positive correlation between mRNA expression levels of GREB1 and MKI67, as well as GMMN and PCNA, which are involved in cell cycle progression (Fig.\u00a02e). These knockdown phenotypes including cell proliferation, HB marker genes expression, and cell cycle progression were confirmed using GREB1-knockout HepG2 cells, which were generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 system, and GREB1 expression rescued them (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02g\u2013j).",
                        "Furthermore, GREB1 knockdown showed an increase in cell death indicated by propidium iodide staining in HepG2 cells, and the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD suppressed GREB1 knockdown-induced cell death (Fig.\u00a02f). Consistently, intracellular levels of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP1 increased in GREB1-depleted HepG2 cells (Fig.\u00a02g). Taken together, these results demonstrate that GREB1 is not only necessary for cellular proliferation but also for cell survival of HB cells."

When the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (amino acids 310\u2013319) was deleted, HA-FLAG-GREB1-\u0394NLS was present throughout the cytosol (Fig.\u00a03a). To clarify how GREB1 regulates cellular proliferation of HB cells, possible interacting proteins were retrieved using the BioGRID database (https://thebiogrid.org/) (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Among the possible GREB1-binding proteins, we focused on Smad4, a central mediator for TGF\u03b2 signaling16. HA-FLAG-GREB1 formed a complex with GFP-tagged Smad3 (Co-Smad) and Smad7 (I-Smad), but not Smad4 (R-Smad) in X293T cells (Fig.\u00a03b). Conversely, HA-FLAG-GREB1-\u0394NLS associated with GFP-tagged Smad4 but not Smad3 or Smad7 (Fig.\u00a03b). Since GFP-Smad3 and GFP-Smad7 were localized to the nucleus while GFP-Smad4 was localized to the cytosol in X293T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a), these results indicate that GREB1 bound to all these Smad family members. In HepG2 cells, GREB1 bound to Smad2/3 endogenously (Fig.\u00a03c), but the interaction of GREB1 with Smad7 or Smad4 was hard to detect. GFP-GREB1 expressed in Huh6 cells also formed a complex with endogenous Smad2/3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). Other nuclear proteins, \u03b2-catenin and c-Myc, did not interact with GFP-Smad3, 4, or 7 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c).Fig. 3GREB1 forms a complex with Smad2/3. a Schematic representation of the GREB1 and GREB1-\u0394NLS (310\u2013319) are shown.

The MH2 domain, but not the MH1 domain, of recombinant GST-Smad2 bound to endogenous GREB1 in HepG2 and Huh6 cell lysates (Fig.\u00a03e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d) under the conditions that GST-Smad2 MH2 domain formed a complex with Smad4.

Consistently, GREB1 knockdown in HepG2 cells increased expression of TGF\u03b2 signal target genes, such as PAI-1 and SNAIL2, and the phenotypes were rescued by GFP-GREB1 expression (Fig.\u00a04c). PAI-1 mRNA was also increased in GREB1 KO HepG2 cells and GREB1 expression restored it (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). In addition, ALK5 inhibitor counteracted upregulation of PAI-1 and SNAIL2 mRNAs induced by GREB1 knockdown (Fig.\u00a04d). However, GREB1 knockdown did not affect TGF\u03b2-dependent nuclear translocation, binding of Smad2/3 to Smad4, or phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c\u2013e).

                        "Transcriptional coactivators such as CBP and p300 possess histone acetyltransferase activity to modify chromatin structure18. The MH2 domain of R-Smads (Smad2/3) directly interacts with CBP or p300 and the interaction is required for the transcriptional activation function of R-Smads19. Endogenous interaction of Smad2/3 and p300 was increased by GREB1 knockdown in HepG2 cells (Fig.\u00a04e). GFP-Smad2/C containing the MH2 domain interacted with p300 in X293T cells, and overexpression of HA-FLAG-GREB1 inhibited their interaction (Fig.\u00a04f), suggesting that GREB1 competes with p300 for binding to Smad2/3. The ChIP assay revealed that GREB1 knockdown increased levels of acetylated histone H4 (acH4) at the PAI-1 locus (exon2) of HepG2 cells, irrespective of exogenous TGF\u03b2 stimulation (Fig.\u00a04g). Expression of constitutively active mutant of TGF\u03b2 receptor 1 (TGFBR1T204D) increased the SNAIL2 and p15/CDKN2B (target gene of TGF\u03b2 signaling) mRNA levels, and GFP-GREB1 but not GFP-GREB1/\u0394M lacking the Smad2/3-binding region inhibited the upregulation (Fig.\u00a04h). Under the same conditions, GREB1 overexpression did not affect Axin2 mRNA expression (Fig.\u00a04h). Consistent with the observation that TGF\u03b2 signaling suppresses AFP and DLK1 in rat fetal hepatocytes and HCC cells20,21, TGFBRT204D expression in HepG2 cells indeed decreased the levels of AFP and DLK1 mRNAs; Smad2/3 knockout rescued GREB1 knockdown-induced decrease in AFP expression (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04f\u2013h). Therefore, GREB1 may prevent Smad2/3 from binding to p300 and inhibit expression of target genes of TGF\u03b2-Smad signaling. However, since Smad2/3 knockout did not rescue DLK1 gene suppression induced by GREB1 knockdown, the mechanism of TGF-\u03b2 signal-mediated regulation of DLK1 expression remains elusive.",
                        "Based on RNA-seq data from the cancer cell line encyclopedia, HepG2 cells expressed much higher levels of TGFB1 than TGFB2 or TGFB3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a). Knockdown of both TGF\u03b21 and GREB1 canceled upregulation of PAI-1 mRNA by GREB1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b). Knockdown of TGF\u03b21 and GREB1 increased and decreased, respectively, HepG2 cell proliferation, and knockdown of TGF\u03b21 in GREB1-depleted cells rescued the growth suppression (Fig.\u00a04i and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). GREB1-depleted cells exhibiting normal cell growth and PAI-1 expression by additional knockdown of TGFB1, showed an increased response of PAI-1 expression to TGF\u03b21 stimulation in the range from 0.01 to 1\u2009ng/ml compared with cells transfected with control or TGFB1 siRNA alone (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d). Among TGF\u03b2-regulated cytostatic genes, including p21, p15, and p27, p15 was dramatically increased by GREB1 knockdown in HepG2 cells and the phenotype was rescued by Smad2/3 knockout (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05e, f). p15 knockdown rescued GREB1 depletion-induced growth suppression and cell death (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05g, h), suggesting that p15 is a key mediator of both growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest, followed by cell death. Consistently, Smad2/3 knockout inhibited the decrease in cell proliferation induced by GREB1 knockdown (Fig.\u00a04j). Thus, GREB1 depletion may increase the susceptibility to autocrine TGF\u03b2 signaling, resulting in the inhibition of cell proliferation.",

                        "GFP-GREB1 was observed as punctates in the interchromatin compartment rather than the chromatin territory of the nucleus of HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). The GREB1 punctates were not colocalized with fibrillarin, SC35, PML protein, or coilin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b), suggesting that GREB1 foci are independently present of nucleoli, nuclear speckles, PML bodies, and Cajal bodies. GFP-GREB1 and FLAG-Smad3 were colocalized and the complex was observed in the interchromatin compartment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c). Endogenous GREB1 and Smad2/3 were present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of HB cells, and TGF\u03b2 stimulation led to dominant accumulation in the nucleus (Fig.\u00a05a). Phosphorylated Smad2/3 clearly formed foci in the nucleus of TGF\u03b2-treated cells and colocalized with GREB1 (Fig.\u00a05b). In addition, PLA assays revealed that TGF\u03b2 stimulation led to close association of Smad2/3 with GREB1 in the border zone between the chromatin territory and interchromatin compartment (Fig.\u00a05c). GFP-GREB1/N or GFP-NLS-GREB1/M was present throughout the nucleus but did not form foci, whereas GFP-NLS-GREB1/C was observed as foci as well as GFP-GREB1 (Fig.\u00a05d), suggesting that the C-terminal region is critical for the localization of GREB1 to the spatially specific region of the nucleus.Fig. 5Interaction of GREB1 and Smad2/3 in the nucleus inhibits Smad-dependent transcription. a HepG2 cells were untreated or treated with 10\u2009ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 30\u2009min, followed by staining with the indicated antibodies and Hoechst33342.

Nascent RNA molecules were observed in the interchromatin compartment of HepG2 cells expressing GFP-Smad3, some of which were colocalized with nuclear foci of GFP-Smad3 (Fig.\u00a05e). Conversely, when HA-FLAG-GREB1 was expressed, EU labeling was decreased on the nuclear foci of GFP-Smad3 (Fig.\u00a05e). These results suggest that transcriptional activity associated with TGF\u03b2-Smad signaling is selectively suppressed by the interaction of Smad2/3 with GREB1 in the border zone of the chromatin and interchromatin regions."

In our conditions of hydrodynamics transfection, YAPS127A and \u0394N\u03b2-catenin (BY model) induced small solid liver nodules but the nodules little expressed GREB1 and DLK1 (Fig.\u00a06b). The combination of c-Met and \u0394N\u03b2-catenin (BM model) induced liver nodules expressing GREB1 and DLK1 to the small extent (Fig.\u00a06b)22. In contrast, the combination of \u0394N\u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met (BYM model) induced larger and multiple liver nodules throughout the liver surface and the tumor nodules highly expressed both GREB1 and DLK1 (Fig.\u00a06b). Tumor nodules of BYM model expressed mRNAs of GREB1 and TACSTD1 higher than those of BY or BM model (Fig.\u00a06c).

However, knockdown of YAP and TAZ in HepG2 and Huh6 cells did not affect GREB1 expression (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b). In addition, treatment of Huh6 cells with CHIR99021 and/or XMU-MP-1, which inhibits Mst1/2 kinase to activate YAP27, increased expression of Cyr61, a YAP target gene, but rather decreased GREB1 expression as well as Axin2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c). Therefore, YAP and TAZ are necessary for promoting HB tumorigenesis but is not essential for GREB1 expression.",
                        "c-Met knockdown in HepG2 cells decreased expression of Axin2 and GREB1 mRNAs, but rather increased expression of ANKRD1 and Cyr61 mRNAs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d).

Thus, c-Met would activate \u03b2-catenin signaling, thereby increasing GREB1 expression.",
                        "HB-related gene expression and histological appearance of six tumor nodules taken from each BYM mouse (C1-C7) were investigated. The volume of whole livers and serum AFP values in the mice of BYM model dramatically increased compared with WT mice (Fig.\u00a07a, b). Real-time PCR analyses revealed that BYM-tumor nodules express all three exogenous genes although the expression levels were variable (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a). The GREB1 mRNA level in individual tumor nodule was higher than that in the nontumor regions and normal liver tissue (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b). Heatmap visualization revealed that GREB1 mRNA levels vary according to tumor nodules in individual mice, and we classified the tumors into high (C1, C4, and C6) and low (C2, C3, C5, and C7) expression groups. In the high GREB1 expression group, TACSD1, DLK1 (HB marker genes), AFP, GPC3 (undifferentiated hepatoblast marker genes), PEG3, MEG3, BEX1 (imprinted genes), and Axin2 tended to be higher than the low GREB1 expression group (Fig.\u00a07c). There was a strong positive correlation between the expression levels of GREB1 and HB-related genes such as DLK1, TACSTD1, GPC3, MEG3, and Axin2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c and Supplementary Table\u00a04).Fig. 7GREB1 expression is involved in HB-like tumorigenesis in vivo. a Images of livers from untreated mice (NL) and mice injected with \u0394N\u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met (BYM) with or without GREB1 shRNA at 8 weeks after hydrodynamic tail vein injection of plasmids.

Tumors from the low GREB1 group of mice mainly contained well-differentiated bigger cells with a clear cytoplasm, uniformly round nuclei, and small nucleoli (Fig.\u00a07d; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08d). Thus, targeted coexpression of \u0394N\u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met in mouse hepatocytes preferentially drives development of well to moderately-differentiated HB-like tumors, which are reminiscent of human crowded fetal HB24.

Tumors developed in BYM GREB1 KD mice (K2 and K4) that expressed low levels of GREB1 mRNA, and their DLK1 and TACSTD1 expression levels were downregulated compared with the high GREB1 expression group of control BYM mice (Fig.\u00a07f). These tumor cells contained well-differentiated HB-like cells with clear cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a07g). The expression of N-cadherin, a target gene of TGF\u03b2 signaling, was lower in the tumor lesions compared with the nontumor regions of BYM mouse livers, whereas in BYM GREB1 KD mice livers, N-cadherin was upregulated in the tumor lesions and became comparable to the nontumor regions, suggesting that TGF\u03b2 signaling was activated by GREB1 depletion (Fig.\u00a07h). Therefore, GREB1 is involved in HB-like histological patterns, marker gene expression, and tumor formation in this mouse model."

                "This study clarified the molecular mechanisms by which GREB1 promotes HB cell proliferation. GREB1 is an estrogen-induced gene product that interacts with ER, and mediates ER-dependent transcription8,9. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, GREB1 is induced through ligand-dependent binding of ER\u03b1 to three estrogen response elements located 1.6, 9.5, and 21.2\u2009kb upstream of the GREB1 transcription start site31. Here, we found the TCF4-binding site located 0.45\u2009kb upstream of the GREB1 gene. In addition, ER\u03b1 is not expressed in HepG2 cells, and ICI.182.780 did not affect GREB1 mRNA expression; in MCF7 cells, C\u0397\u0399R99021 did not induce GREB1 mRNA expression. Therefore, the GREB1 gene could be expressed by different mechanisms depending on cell type, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal-dependent GREB1 expression may be confined to specific cells, including hepatoblasts.",
                "The crosstalk between the Wnt and TGF\u03b2 pathways has been extensively studied, and it was shown that components of Wnt and TGF\u03b2 signaling physically interact and mutually regulate each other, resulting in the fine-tuning of the development process and homeostasis32\u201334. TGF\u03b2 usually inhibits (but sometimes stimulates) cell proliferation in a cell-type specific manner16. The key finding in this study is that the Wnt signal transcriptional target GREB1 binds to Smad2/3 in the nucleus and inhibits TGF\u03b2 signaling, resulting in the stimulation of cell proliferation. GREB1 is localized to the chromatin-free space in the nucleus. Although the interchromatin space contains speckles, Cajal bodies, and PML bodies35, GREB1 was not colocalized with them but with phosphorylated Smad2/3. Since chromatin loops can expand into the interchromatin space where transcription and splicing factors freely roam36, GREB1 could inhibit TGF\u03b2 signaling in this space by competing with p300. These results indicate that GREB1 regulates cellular functions independently of estrogen and androgen signaling and uncovers the involvement of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-GREB1-Smads axis in HB pathogenesis.",
                "Several types of HB mouse models have been generated, including tissue-specific transgenic mice with expression of c-Myc or Lin28b, and mice hydrodynamically transfected with activated \u03b2-catenin and YAP22\u201324. These murine models can phenotypically display both HCCs and HBs25,37, however, HB mouse models that recapitulate human HB characteristics are still limited. In this study we demonstrated that forced expression of YAP with \u03b2-catenin and c-Met accelerated tumor formation with characteristics resembling human crowded fetal HB cells24 and expression of liver progenitor marker genes compared with BY or BM model. However, the BYM model tumors with low expression of GREB1 contained well-differentiated cells with a clear cytoplasm and small nucleoli, which are difficult to distinguish from HCC cells. Since YAP antagonizes Wnt activity in development and human cancer38, hyperactivation of YAP signaling was thought to suppress GREB1 expression. However, YAP did not affect GREB1 expression. Therefore, YAP could be important for rapid de-differentiation and proliferation of hepatocyte/hepatoblast in HB model. One of the reasons why c-Met promotes GREB1 expression in liver tumors would be due to the activation of the \u03b2-catenin pathway by phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin at Tyr654. Taken together, the BYM model would be the appropriate model for analyzing HB.",
                "Tumors of the high GREB1 expression group highly expressed HB and undifferentiated markers compared with those of the low GREB1 expression group. ShRNA-mediated GREB1 knockdown strongly suppressed marker gene expression and HB-like liver tumorigenesis in BYM mice. From the results of GREB1 depletion in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is believed that GREB1 may represent a molecular target for treating HB. Since GREB1 is a nuclear protein, one strategy for targeting GREB1 is by using nucleic acids rather than low molecular compounds or antibodies. We synthesized GREB1 ASOs, which were flanked by AmNA with a phosphorothioate backbone. This type of ASO is stable in the blood and can be highly incorporated into liver cells in vivo30,39,40, with the advantage of being less toxic41. Indeed, GREB1 ASOs suppressed HepG2-induced xenograft liver tumor formation and HB-like tumor formation in BYM model mice as well as inhibiting GREB1 expression. Thus, GREB1 ASOs may be a good candidate of molecularly targeted therapy for HB."
