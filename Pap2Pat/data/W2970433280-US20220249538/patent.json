    "abstract": "The purpose of the present invention is to provide a novel tumor treatment agent. In GREB1-positive tumors that do not exhibit sex hormone sensitivity, GREB1 is a downstream target gene of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal. Through the use as an active ingredient of a substance that can inhibit GREB1 expression, the growth of GREB1-positive tumor cells that do not exhibit sex hormone sensitivity can be effectively inhibited and such a tumor can be treated.",

                        "Hepatoblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the liver of a child. Hepatoblastoma, most of which occur before the age of 3 years, account for 90% of all malignant hepatic tumors of children younger than 4 years. In Japan, 30 to 40 new cases of hepatoblastoma occur each year, with an incidence of about 1 in 1,000,000 people in the world, and hepatoblastoma is considered as a rare cancer. Although causes of the development of hepatoblastoma are not known, it is found that approximately 70% of the patients have a deletion or an activation mutation in a region including exon 3 associated with \u03b2-catenin degradation, and hepatoblastoma is common to groups with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with \u03b2-catenin accumulation. Thus, it is thought that activation of Wnt signal contributes to the pathological conditions.",
                        "In hepatoblastoma patients, since whether or not complete resection has been achieved has influence on the prognosis, the selection of therapeutic strategies depends on staging after surgery. Although the prognosis after complete resection is good in cases of disease stage (stage) I, the 5-year disease-free survival rate decreases to only 36% in cases of disease stage IV with distant metastasis. Conventionally, in the treatment of hepatoblastoma, chemotherapy and surgical resection are given in combination. In chemotherapies, although a regimen including cisplatin has been established as a standard therapy, severe side effects such as myelosuppression and renal insufficiency are problematic.",
                        "On the other hand, GREB1 was discovered as one of estrogen-induced genes in breast cancer cells (see Non-Patent Document 1). It has been reported that the expression is directly induced by estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), and GREB1 is highly expressed in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells, but is not expressed in ER\u03b1-negative cells. It has been reported that ER\u03b1 binds to a promoter region of GREB1 gene to induce expression of GREB1, and its direct interaction with ER\u03b1 activates the transcriptional activity (see Non-Patent Document 2). Actually, it has been reported that the expression level of GREB1 mRNA is correlated with an ER\u03b1 expression level in a breast cancer (see Non-Patent Document 2). Moreover, it is known that knockdown of GREB1 suppresses proliferation of breast cancer cells, and overexpression of GREB1 accelerates proliferation of breast cancer cells (see Non-Patent Document 3). Furthermore, it has been reported that GREB1 is not expressed in ER\u03b1-negative cells, and that GREB1 is expressed in ER\u03b1-positive ovarian cancer cells and plays an important role in ovarian cancer cell proliferation (see Non-Patent Document 4). Because a GREB1 promoter region has androgen-responsive sequences, GREB1 is induced by androgen in androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cells, but is not induced in AR-negative cells (see Non-Patent Document 5). Thus, GREB1 acts as a mediator for proliferation of sex hormone-sensitive tumors.",
                        "However, it has still not been elucidated whether or not the expression of GREB1 plays a role in tumorigenesis of tumors other than sex hormone-sensitive tumors."

As a result, the present inventors have found that, in hepatoblastoma cells, liver cancer cells, malignant melanoma cells, neuroblastoma cells, or the like, although cell proliferation is not accelerated by sex hormones such as estrogen and androgen, there are tumor cells expressing GREB1, and found that GREB1 participates in proliferation of the tumor cells having such characteristics (i.e., GREB1-positive tumors that do not show sex hormone sensitivity). Specifically, the present inventors have found that, among the GREB1-positive tumors that do not show sex hormone sensitivity, in hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular cancer, GREB1 is a target gene for Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal, in malignant melanoma, GREB1 is a target gene for a transcriptional factor MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), and in neuroblastoma, GREB1 may contribute to gene amplification. Further, the present inventors have found that proliferation of the sex hormone insensitive GREB1-positive tumors is suppressed by siRNAs or antisense oligonucleotides against GREB1. In addition, the present inventors have also found tumor tissue-specific GREB1 expression in hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular cancer, malignant melanoma, and neuroblastoma by immunochemical investigation.

Examples of the sex hormone insensitive GREB1-positive tumors include hepatoblastoma, hepatocellular cancer, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma, and the like.

Specifically, when immunohistochemical analysis is performed on a sampled piece of tumor tissue using an anti-GREB1 antibody, and a region in which expression of GREB1 is observed accounts for 5% or more of the suspected tumor area, it is determined that GREB1 is expressed. When a region in which expression of GREB1 is observed accounts for 20% or more of the suspected tumor area, it is determined that expression level of GREB1 is high. When a region in which expression of GREB1 is observed accounts for 50% or more of the suspected tumor area, it is determined that expression level of GREB1 is particularly high.",

In this case, the determination of the expression level of GREB1 can be made by using a nonneoplastic region of the same tissue in the same case from which the tumor is sampled as a standard. Specifically, when the amount of GREB1 in the cell lysates of a suspected tumor region is larger than the amount of GREB1 in the cell lysates of the nonneoplastic region in the same case from which the suspected tumor is sampled, it is determined that GREB1 is expressed.",

In HepG2 cells transfected with control siRNA or siRNA against \u03b2-catenin (\u03b2-catenin siRNA), RNA sequence analysis was performed. As a result, in 8929 genes, 76 genes were selected as candidate genes based on the following criteria: expression level was high (FPKM\u22653), and in the cells transfected with \u03b2-catenin siRNA (\u03b2-catenin knockdown cells), expression level was decreased 3-fold or more as compared to the cells transfected with control siRNA (control cells) (see a of FIG. 1). Further, the candidate genes were narrowed down based on the presence of a DNA binding site of TCF7L2 (TCF4) found by ChIP sequence analysis in HepG2 using a gene set of ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding Site Profiles (TCF7L2#HepG2#hg19#1), and 11 genes were selected (see a of FIG. 1, and Table 4). In the lower image of a of FIG. 1, a heat map of candidate genes in which expression levels of the genes in control cells varied from those in \u03b2-catenin knockdown cells are shown. The genes shown in the lower left of a of FIG. 1 represent randomly selected 11 genes among the 76 varied candidate genes.",

GREB1, which is one of the candidate genes, is an estrogen-responsive gene in the estrogen receptor regulatory pathway, and it is known that the gene participates in hormone-dependent cancer cell proliferation in breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, it has been previously unknown that whether the gene acts as a downstream target gene of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal, and participates in tumorigenesis of a cancer that does not express an estrogen receptor. Thus, the present inventors have focused on GREB1 and performed further analysis.",
                                "By chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, it is revealed that TCF4 and \u03b2-catenin form complexes with a TCF4 binding site present in a 5\u2032-upstream region \u2212443 to \u2212448 of human GREB1 gene (see b of FIG. 1). In fact, in \u03b2-catenin knockdown HepG2 cells, a decrease in the GREB1 expression level and a decrease in the amount of the protein were demonstrated (see c of FIG. 1). On the other hand, when HepG2 cells was treated with an estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182,786 for 48 hours, and thereafter the expression level of GREB1 mRNA was measured by real-time PCR analysis, it was confirmed that the expression level of GREB1 was not affected by ICI-182,786 (see a of FIG. 2). In mouse fetal liver cells (BMEL) cells having dual differentiation potential, the expression of GREB1 was increased as in Axin2 by CHIR99021 treatment having a \u03b2-catenin signal activation activity (see b of FIG. 2). In Huh6 cells, which are cells of a hepatoblastoma cell line having a G34V somatic cell mutation in CTNNB1 (\u03b2-catenin) gene, the expression level of GREB1 was decreased by knockdown of \u03b2-catenin (see c of FIG. 2). In Huh6, the expression level of GREB1 mRNA was low as compared to HepG2 (see d of FIG. 2). In MCF7, which is an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, expression of GREB1 was dramatically decreased by ICI-182,786 treatment. However, expression of Axin2 was increased by treatment with CHIR99021 having a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal activation activity either in the presence or absence of ICI-182,786, whereas expression of GREB1 was not increased (see e of FIG. 2). Further, in HLE, SNU-387 SNU-449, and Huh7, which are human hepatocellular cancer cells, expression of Axin2 was increased by CHIR99021 treatment, whereas expression of GREB1 was not increased (see f of FIG. 2). From these results, it is suggested that GREB1 is a downstream target gene of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal specific to hepatoblastoma cells or immature liver progenitor cells.",
                                "An analysis was performed in 11 cases of hepatoblastoma. Specifically, hepatoblastoma tissues of the 11 cases were stained with anti-GREB1 antibody and hematoxylin. As a result, in 10 cases (90.9%) among the 11 cases, expression of GREB1 was observed in a neoplastic lesion area, whereas expression of GREB1 was not observed in a nonneoplastic area (see Table 5, and d of FIG. 1). Percentages of areas immunostained with the anti-GREB1 antibody with respect to the total area of the neoplastic lesion area were classified into three categories (<5% (Negative), 5 to 30% (Low), and 30 to 95% (High)), and the cases showing \u22655% staining were considered as GREB1-positive. The region specific expression pattern of GREB1 in the hepatoblastoma tissues demonstrated a tendency to show a positive correlation with accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in serial sections (see e of FIG. 1). The hepatoblastoma tissues were histologically divided into two types, in which one type of the tissue was formed of solid and unpolarized cells, and the other type was formed of tubular and polarized cells. Among these, GREB1 was highly expressed specifically in the former histological type (solid and unpolarized cells). Further, the hepatoblastoma tissues of the 11 cases were stained with anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody and hematoxylin. As a result, it was found that the expression level of \u03b2-catenin was increased in the neoplastic lesion area as compared to that in the nonneoplastic area (see g of FIG. 2). Percentages of areas immunostained with the anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody with respect to the total area of the neoplastic lesion area were classified into three categories (<5% (Negative), 5 to 30% (Low), and 30 to 95% (High)), and the cases showing \u22655% staining were as \u03b2-catenin-positive.",
                                "Further, using a public dataset of hepatoblastoma patients obtained from R2 genomics and a visualization platform database (http://r2.amc.nl), the correlation between the expression of GREB1 gene and the expression of a target gene of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal in hepatoblastoma was analyzed. Two parameters associated with the GREB1 gene expression and the target gene expression were available with respect to 50 neoplastic lesion areas and 5 nonneoplastic areas in hepatoblastoma cases. As a result of the analysis, it was found that, in the neoplastic lesion area, GREB1 mRNA was significantly upregulated as compared to that in the region of the nonneoplastic area (see f of FIG. 1). Further, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated between the expression levels of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal target genes, such as Axin2, DKK1, NKD1, and glutamine synthetase (GS), and the expression level of GREB1 (see g of FIG. 1). On the other hand, expression of downstream target genes of estrogen receptors, such as PRLR and XBP1, was not changed significantly (see i of FIG. 2). That is, from these results, it is confirmed that, in hepatoblastoma, activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal, rather than estrogen receptor signal, causes increase in expression of GREB1.",
                                "According to a public dataset of hepatoblastoma patients, in cases in which the region of exon 3 or exon 4 of CTNNB1 gene in hepatoblastoma had a mutation or a deletion, expression of GREB1 was not significantly changed as compared to that in cases without mutation (see j of FIG. 2). Similarly, in Axin2 and GS, which are downstream target genes of \u03b2-catenin, the expressions were not changed regardless of whether an abnormality of CTNNB1 gene was present or not. From these results, it is revealed that the expression of GREB1 in hepatoblastoma is correlated with the activity of \u03b2-catenin signal, but does not necessarily associate with a mutation in the region of exon 3 or exon 4 of CTNNB1 gene. Thus, it is suggested that a different types of \u03b2-catenin signal activation independent of CTNNB1 gene mutations or CTNNB1 gene mutations may occur.",

                                "As reported previously, knockdown of \u03b2-catenin decreased HepG2 cell proliferation (see a of FIG. 3). Further, expression of exogenous GREB1 partially restored the phenotype by the knockdown of \u03b2-catenin (see a of FIG. 3). Thus, to elucidate the role of GREB1 in HepG2 cells, knockdown of GREB1 was carried out using two different siRNAs. As a result of probing lysates of GREB1 knockdown cells with anti-GREB1 antibody, anti-Axin2 antibody, anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody, and anti-HSP90 antibody, it was demonstrated that although siRNAs (GREB1 #1 siRNA and GREB1 #2 siRNA) knocked down GREB1 (see b of FIG. 3), the knockdown of GREB1 had no effect on the expressions of PRLR and XBP1 as ER signal target genes (see c of FIG. 3) and also had no effect on the expressions of \u03b2-catenin and Axin2 (see b of FIG. 3). That is, these results suggest that GREB1 is not a gene that functions upstream of ER and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signals.",
                                "Mock HepG2 cells (having a vector only, containing no GREB1) or GREB1-transduced HepG2 cells were transfected with control siRNA or two different types of siRNA (GREB1 #1 siRNA and GREB1 #2 siRNA), then two-dimensional culture (plastic dish culture) was performed, and a relative cell number was calculated by Cyquant assay overtime. As a result, in GREB1 knockdown, proliferative capacity of HepG2 cells in two-dimensional culture was reduced. However, when GREB1-transduced HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNAs against GREB1 (GREB1 #1 siRNA/GREB1 and GREB1 #2 siRNA/GREB1), the proliferative capacity of HepG2 cells was not affected (see a of FIG. 4).",
                                "Further, HepG2 cells transfected with control siRNA or siRNA (GREB1 #2 siRNA) were cultured in 3D Matrigel for 5 days, and the cultured cells were stained with phalloidin to measure the areas of spheres (n=20). As a result, knockdown of GREB1 reduced the area of sphere to half (b of FIG. 4). On the other hand, in the case of GREB1 knockdown, it was found that the ratio of spheres having polarized lumens was increased (b of FIG. 4). The ratio of spheres having polarized lumens was calculated as a ratio of spheres having F-actin-positive central microlumen to the total spheres. From these results, it was suggested that GREB1 knockdown HepG2 cells were transformed into a differentiation state having epithelial polarization. These results were in agreement with the result that GREB1 was specifically expressed in solid unpolarized cells in hepatoblastoma tissues (see h of FIG. 2). In fact, GREB1 knockdown significantly decreased the expressions of DLK1, AFP, and PEG3, which are undifferentiated hepatic progenitor cell marker genes (c of FIG. 4). In agreement with these results, also in a public dataset of hepatoblastoma patients, a significant positive correlation is confirmed between the expression levels of hepatoblastoma marker genes, such as DLK1 and TACSTD1, and the expression level of GREB1 (see d of FIG. 3).",

That is, from these results, it is revealed that expression of GREB1 in hepatoblastoma cells constitutes one factor in increase in the proliferative capacity.",

As a result, it is revealed that knockdown of GREB1 decreases expression of cell cycle regulators including cyclinA, cyclinB, and phosphorylated histone H3 (see d of FIG. 4).",

                                "In agreement with a previous report in breast cancer cells, in X293T cells, HA-FLAG-GREB1 mainly localized in the nucleus (see a of FIG. 5). A mutant GREB1 (HA-FLAG-\u0394NLS-GREB1) in which amino acids at positions 310 to 319, which is a nuclear localization signal (NLS) of GREB1, were deleted localized in the cytoplasm (see a of FIG. 5). To elucidate the mechanism by which GREB1 regulates the proliferation of hepatoblastoma cells independent of ER signal, candidate proteins that may interact with GREB1 were identified using Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) (https://thebiogrid.org/). As a result, as candidate proteins that may interact with GREB1, proteins shown in Table 6 were found.",
                                "Among these candidate proteins, the present inventors focused on Smad4, which is a central mediator of TGF\u03b2 signal. Smad proteins include three classes, depending on the functions, consisting of Smad3 (Co-mediator Smad, Co-Smad), Smad4 (receptor-regulated Smad, R-Smad), and Smad7 (inhibitory Smad, I-Smad). In X293T cells, GFP-Smad3 and GFP-Smad7 were mainly localized in the nucleus, and GFP-Smad4 was localized in the cytoplasm (see a of FIG. 6). Thus, complex formation ability of Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 with GREB1 was evaluated. Specifically, first, cell lysates of X293T cells expressing HA-FLAG-GREB1, and GFP, GFP-Smad3, GFP-Smad4, or GFP-Smad7 were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Next, the cell lysates (Input) and the immunoprecipitates (IP) were reacted with anti-HA antibody or anti-GFP antibody. As a result, it was demonstrated that HA-FLAG-GREB1 formed complexes with Smad3 (Co-Smad) and Smad7 (I-Smad), whereas did not form complexes with Smad4 (R-Smad)(see b of FIG. 5). On the other hand, it was demonstrated that HA-FLAG-\u0394NLS-GREB1 formed complexes with Smad4 (R-Smad), whereas did not form complexes with Smad3 (Co-Smad) and Smad7 (I-Smad) (see b of FIG. 5). From these results, it is suggested that GREB1 binds to all Smad families depending on their intracellular localization. Further, when lysates of HepG2 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad2/3 antibody and the resulting immunoprecipitates (IP) were reacted with anti-Smad2/3 antibody and anti-GREB1 antibody, biding of GREB1 to endogenous Smad2/3 was demonstrated (see c of FIG. 5), whereas interaction between GREB1, and Smad4 or Smad7 was hardly observed (data not shown). Also, in Huh6 allowed to express GFP-GREB1, when cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and the resulting immunoprecipitates (IP) were reacted with anti-Smad2/3 antibody and anti-GREB1 antibody, binding of GREB1 to endogenous Smad2/3 was demonstrated (see b of FIG. 6). On the other hand, interaction of \u03b2-catenin and c-Myc, which are other nucleus proteins, with GFP-Smad3, GFP-Smad4, or GFP-Smad7 was not observed (see c of FIG. 6). Thus, functional interaction between GREB1 and Smad2/3 was further investigated.",
                                "It is known that Smad2 has two functional domain, that is, an MH1 domain and an MH2 domain (seed of FIG. 5). Thus, binding properties of Smad2 with GREB1 were evaluated using full-length Smad2 (Full), a Smad2 mutant (N) consisting only of a N-terminal region containing the MH1 domain in which a C-terminal region (amino acids at positions 266 to 467) was deleted, and a Smad2 mutant (C) consisting only of a C-terminal region containing the MH2 domain in which an N-terminal region (amino acids at positions (1 to 265) was deleted (see d of FIG. 5). First, lysates of X293T cells expressing HA-FLAG-mGREB1, and GFP or GFP-Smad2 (Full, mutant N, or mutant C) were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Next, the cell lysates (input) and the immunoprecipitates (IP) were reacted with anti-HA antibody or anti-GFP antibody. As a result, GFP-Smad2 (mutant C) formed complexes with GREB1, whereas GFP-Smad2 (mutant N) did not form complexes with GREB1 (see d of FIG. 5). In addition, the recombinant GST-Smad2/MH2 domain bound to endogenous GREB1 and GFP-GREB1 expressed in Huh6 cells in a pull-down assay under conditions in which endogenous Smad4 of HepG2 cells bound (see e of FIG. 5). On the other hand, under the same conditions, the recombinant GST-Smad2/MH1 domain did not bind (see e of FIG. 5). Also, in Huh6 cells allowed to express GFP-GREB1, the same tendency was demonstrated (see d of FIG. 6). From these results, it is suggested that GREB1 directly binds to Smad2/3 in hepatoblastoma cells.",
                                "Further, to identify the regions where GREB1 interacts with Smad2/3, mutant N (1 to 666) in which amino acids at positions 667 to 1954 of GREB1 were deleted, mutant M (667 to 1333) in which amino acids at positions 1 to 666 and positions 1334 to 1954 of GREB1 were deleted, and mutant C (1334 to 1954) in which amino acids at positions 1 to 1333 of GREB1 were deleted were prepared, and, in addition, NLS-GREB1 mutants (NLS/667-1333 and NLS/1334-1954) in which three copies of NLS sequence (SEQ ID NO: 109) derived from SV40T antigen were bound to the N terminal of the mutants M and C that have no NLS were prepared (see f of FIG. 5). Then, X293T cells expressing the GFP-GREB1 mutants were stained with anti-GFP antibody and Hoechst33342 (see f of FIG. 5). As a result, it was demonstrated that the GREB1 mutants (1 to 666, NLS/667-1333, and NLS/1334-1954) were localized in the nucleus.",

As a result, it was found that, in X293T cells, GREB1 mutant (NLS/667-1333) bound to Smad3, whereas GREB1 mutants (1 to 666 and NLS/1334-1954) hardly bound to Smad3 (see g of FIG. 5).",

Lysates of X293T cells expressing these mutants were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Next, the resulting cell lysates (input) and immunoprecipitates (IP) were further reacted with anti-FLAG antibody or anti-GFP antibody (see e of FIG. 6). As a result, it was demonstrated that the wild type GREB1 bound to Smad3, whereas the mutants in which amino acids at positions 667 to 1333 of GREB1 were deleted did not bind to Smad3 (see e of FIG. 6). From the above-described results, it is revealed that the amino acid region at positions 667 to 1333 of GREB1 plays an important role in the binding to Smad3. Further, these results suggest that the amino acid region containing amino acids at positions 667 to 1333 of GREB1 interacts with the NH2 domain of Smad2/3 and forms complexes in the nucleus of hepatoblastoma cells.",

On the other hand, expression levels of PAI-1 or GADD45B, which are target genes of TGF\u03b2 signal, were significantly decreased in tumor lesion sites as compared to those in nonneoplastic areas (see a of FIG. 7).

                                "Further, HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL of TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes, and the cultured cells were fixed and stained with anti-GREB1 antibody, anti-phosphorylated SMAD2/3(pSMAD2/3) antibody, and Hoechst33342. As a result, it was confirmed that, in the cells treated with TGF\u03b2, the phosphorylated SMAD2/3 accumulated in the nucleus, and colocalized with GREB1 (see b of FIG. 11).",
                                "Further, HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL of TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes, and the cultured cells were fixed and incubated with mouse anti-GREB1 antibody and rabbit anti-SMAD2/3 antibody, which were added to the cultured cells. Next, to these primary antibodies, secondary antibodies (PLA (proximity ligation assay) probe) were allowed to bind. As a result, it was found that Smad2/3 localized TGF\u03b2 stimulation dependently in the vicinity of GREB1 in a boundary area between the chromatin region and the interchromatin region (see c of FIG. 11). GREB1 mutant (1 to 666 and NLS/667-1333) existed over the whole of the nucleus, but did not form nuclear focuses. On the contrary, GREB1 mutant (NLS/1334-1954) formed nuclear focuses as in GREB1 (full length). Accordingly, it is suggested that the C-terminal region of GREB1 has an important role in localization of GREB1 in a specific region in the nucleus (see d of FIG. 11).",
                                "To elucidate the functional interaction of specific localization of GREB1 and Smad2/3 in the nucleus, transcriptional activity was visualized by analysis of RNA synthesis using ethynyl uridine (EU). Specifically, first, HepG2 cells expressing GFP-SMAD3 with or without expression of HA-FLAG-GREB1 were incubated in the presence of EU at a final concentration of 1 mM for 30 minutes. The incubated cells were fixed, and stained with anti-GFP antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, and Hoechst33342. It has been confirmed that when HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence of EU for 30 minutes and the incubated cells were fixed, EU-labeled regions in the nucleus can be detected (see d of FIG. 10). As a result of the above-described experiment, in HepG2 cells expressing GFP-SMAD3, newly produced RNA molecules were observed over the whole of the nucleoplasm, and it was observed that some of the RNA molecules colocalized with nuclear focuses of GFP-Smad3 (see e of FIG. 11). On the other hand, in HepG2 cells expressing GFP-SMAD3 and HA-FLAG-GREB1, the EU label did not colocalize with nuclear focuses of GFP-Smad3 (see e of FIG. 11). That is, from these results, it is suggested that transcriptional activity associated with TGF\u03b2-SMAD signal is selectively inhibited by interaction between Smad2/3 and GREB1 in a boundary area between a chromatin region and an interchromatin region.",

                                "Some mouse liver tumor models of hepatocellular cancer and hepatoblastoma have been developed using genomic manipulation and/or hydrodynamic transfection of oncogenes. Further, it is reported that overexpression of constitutively active \u03b2-catenin and YAP using hydrodynamic transfection acutely induces liver tumors having characteristics of hepatocellular cancer and hepatoblastoma. In fact, when hepatoblastoma tissues (n=11) were immunostained with anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody and hematoxylin, tumor cell-specific overexpression of YAP in the cytoplasm or the nucleus in 9 tissues (positive rate: 81.8%) out of the 11 hepatoblastoma tissues were observed, and \u03b2-catenin and GREB1 were positive in all of the 9 tissues (see a of FIG. 12). Further, it is reported that HGF-c-Met pathway was activated in hepatoblastoma, and constitutively active form of coexpression of \u03b2-catenin and c-Met induces liver tumor in mouse.",
                                "A search for effective combinations of \u03b2-catenin, YAP, and c-Met for hepatoblastoma formation by a hydrodynamic transfection method was carried out. In a mouse transduced with both \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, in which amino acids at positions 1 to 90 of human \u03b2-catenin were deleted, and YAPS127A, which was a YAP mutant in which serine at position 127 was substituted by alanine to avoid phosphorylation of the serine, in combination (BY model), a small tumor mass was formed in the liver 6 weeks after transduction, whereas almost no expression of GREB1 and DLK1 was observed immunohistologically (see b of FIG. 12). In a mouse transduced with \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin and c-Met in combination (BM model), small expression of GREB1 and DLK1 was observed immunohistologically in a tumor mass formed in the liver 6 weeks after transduction (see b of FIG. 12). On the other hand, in a mouse transduced with \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met in combination (BYM model), large multiple tumor masses were formed in the liver 6 weeks after transduction, and high expressions of GREB1 and DLK1 were observed immunohistologically (see b of FIG. 12). Further, when mRNA levels of GREB1 and TACSTD1 in tumor nodules of BY model, BM model, and BYM model were measured by real-time PCR, the mRNA levels in BYM mouse were higher than those in BY model and BM model (see c of FIG. 12). From these results, BYM model is considered as a suitable model for in vivo functional analysis of GREB1 in hepatoblastoma.",
                                "Next, the mechanism for regulating expression of GREB1 in hepatoblastoma by YAP and c-Met was investigated. Huh6 cells or HepG2 cells were fixed and stained with anti-YAP antibody and Hoechst33342, and it was found that YAP was strongly accumulated in the nucleus in Huh6 cells as compared to HepG2 cells (see a of FIG. 13). However, in Huh6 cells and HepG2 cells, knockdown of YAP/TAZ had no effect on expression of GREB1 (see b of FIG. 13). Further, when Huh6 cells was treated with CHIR99021, or treated with XMU-MP1, which has an inhibitory effect on Mst1/2 kinase and is an activator of YAP, or treated with CHIR99021 and XMU-MP1 in combination, mRNA expression of GREB1 was suppressed as in mRNA expression of Axin2 (see c of FIG. 13). From these results, it is suggested that YAP/TAZ is necessary for hepatoblastoma formation, but is not essential for GREB1 expression.",
                                "Further, when c-Met was knocked down in HepG2 cells, the expressions of Axin2 mRNA and GREB1 mRNA were suppressed, whereas the expressions of ANKRD1 and Cyr61, which are downstream target genes of YAP, were increased (see d of FIG. 13). It is reported that HGF-c-Met signaling pathway accelerates phosphorylation of tyrosine at position 654 of \u03b2-catenin and nuclear transport of \u03b2-catenin, and activates \u03b2-catenin signal. In fact, when c-Met was knocked down in HepG2 cells, phosphorylation of tyrosine at position 654 of \u03b2-catenin was weakened, and the expressions of GREB1 and Axin2 were decreased (see e of FIG. 13). From these results, it is suggested that c-Met induces phosphorylation of tyrosine of \u03b2-catenin, and thereby activates \u03b2-catenin signal to increase expression of GREB1.",
                                "Further, \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, YapS127A, and c-Met were administered to mice together with GREB1 shRNA, and the livers were collected 7 to 8 weeks after administration. As a result, in mice transduced with \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met (BYM mice, control), a plurality of nodules were observed on the entire surfaces of the livers (see a of FIG. 14). On the other hand, in mice transduced with GREB1 shRNA together with \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met (BYM GREB1 KD mice), the nodules in the liver were suppressed (see a of FIG. 14). In addition, when tumor nodules were obtained from the livers of BYM mice (C1 to C7) and the liver of an untreated mouse (NL mouse), and the expression levels of \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, YAPS127A, and c-Met were measured by real-time PCR, it was demonstrated that all of the \u0394N90 \u03b2-catenin, the YAPS127A, and the c-Met were expressed in BYM mice (see a of FIG. 15).",
                                "Further, total RNAs were extracted from the liver of an untreated mouse (NL), tumor nodules (n=42) of BYM mice, and nonneoplastic tissues (n=8) of BYM mice, and mRNA levels of GREB1 were measured by real-time PCR. As a result, mRNA levels of GREB1 in each of the tumor nodules were high as compared to those in the nonneoplastic tissues and the normal liver tissue (see b of FIG. 15).",
                                "Further, 6 tumor nodules were obtained from each of the BYM mice (C1 to C7), and the expressions of hepatoblastoma-related genes and histological appearances were investigated. As a result, by visualization using a heat map, it was demonstrated that the mRNA levels of GREB1 in the tumor nodules of the respective mice were different from each other (see b of FIG. 14). According to the mRNA levels, the mice were classified into two groups: a high GREB1 mRNA level group (GREB1 high: C1, C4, and C6) and a low group (GREB1 low: C2, C3, C5, and C7). The GREB1 high group had a tendency to express high TACSD1, DLK1 (hepatoblastoma marker gene), AFP, GFP3 (undifferentiated hepatoblast marker gene), PEG3, MEG3, BEX1 (imprinting genes), and Axin2 as compared to the GREB1 low group (see b of FIG. 14). Further, using tumor nodules obtained from the above-described BYM mice (C1 to C7), the expression levels of REB1, and mRNA expression levels of hepatoblastoma-related genes (DLK 1, TACSTD1, GPC3, MEG3, and Axin2) were measured, and it was demonstrated that there were strong positive correlations between the expression levels of GREB1 and the expression levels of hepatoblastoma-related genes (see c of FIG. 15, and Table 7).",
                                "Further, tissue sections of the livers resected from BYM mice in the GREB1 high group (C4) and the GREB1 low group (C3) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. As a result, it was found that most tumors in the GREB1 high group had high nucleus/cytoplasm ratios, and had high proliferative capacity (see c of FIG. 14, and d of FIG. 15). Further, tumors in the GREB1 low group mainly contained large differentiated cells each having definite cytoplasm, a uniform round nucleus, and a small nucleolus (see c of FIG. 14, and d of FIG. 15).",
                                "Further, tissue sections of the livers resected from BYM mice in the GREB1 high group (C4) and the GREB1 low group (C3) were stained with anti-GREB1 antibody or anti-DLK1 antibody, and hematoxylin. As a result, it was demonstrated immunohistochemically that the expressions of GREB1 and DLK1 in the neoplastic lesion areas were high as compared to those of the nonneoplastic area, and the levels of staining was correlated with the levels of differentiation (see d of FIG. 14).",
                                "When GREB was knocked down in BYM mice (BYM GREB1 KD mice; K1 to K6), the incidence rate of tumorigenesis was decreased, and any tumor was not observed in 4 out of the 6 mice (see a of FIG. 14). Further, in BYM+ GREB1 shRNA mouse, the weight of the liver and serum AFP level were dramatically decreased as compared to those of BYM mouse without GREB knockdown (see e of FIG. 15).",
                                "Further, total RNAs were extracted from tumor nodules of three BYM mice (C1, C4, and C6), four BYM mice (C2, C3, C5, and C7), and two BYM mice dosed with GREB1 shRNA (BYM GREB1 KD mice; K2 and K4), and the mRNA levels of GREB1, DLK1, and TASCSTD1 were analyzed by real-time PCR. As a result, tumors of BYM GREB1 KD mice (K2 and K4) had low GREB1 mRNA expression levels, whereas the expression levels of DLK1 and TACSTD1 were the same as those of the GREB1 low group of BYM mice (see f of FIG. 14). Further, tissue sections of the livers of BYM mouse (C4) and BYM GREB1 KD mouse (K2) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin or anti-GREB1 antibody, and hematoxylin. As a result, it was demonstrated that these cells had well differentiated hepatoblastoma-like cells having definite cytoplasm (see g of FIG. 14).",
                                "Further, it is known that N-cadherin is a target gene of TGF\u03b2 signaling, and the expression level is high in hepatoblastoma cells, rather than in mesenchymal cells in tumor tissue. Thus, tissue sections of the livers of BYM mouse (C4) and BYM GREB1 KD mouse (K2) were stained with anti-N-cadherin antibody and Hoechst33342. As a result, in the BYM mouse, the expression of N-cadherin was low in neoplastic lesion areas as compared to that in nonneoplastic areas. On the other hand, in BYM GREB1 KD mice, it was found that N-cadherin was upregulated in neoplastic lesion areas, and the expression level was the same as that in nonneoplastic areas (see h of FIG. 14). That is, from these results, it is suggested that TGF\u03b2 signaling is activated by suppression of GREB1 expression.",

The mice were sacrificed 28 days after grafting, and xenograft tumors were resected. The appearance and weight of the xenograft tumors were measured. As a result, subcutaneous xenograft tumors were formed in the case of wild type HepG2 cells, whereas the sizes and weights of tumors were decreased in GREB1 knockout HepG2 cells (see a of FIG. 16). Further, expression of GREB1 restored the phenotypes induced by GREB1 knockout, whereas the restoration was not observed by expression of GREB1\u0394NLS (see a of FIG. 16). In addition, since knockout of Smad2/3 restored the phenotype induced by GREB1 knockout, it was confirmed that GREB1 inhibited the suppression of TGF\u03b2 signal-dependent cell proliferation in vivo.",
                                "Further, lysates of HepG2 cells (Control), GREB1 knockout HepG2 cells (GREB1 KO), or HepG2 cells in which GREB1 and Smad2/3 were knocked out in combination (GREB1 KO+Smad2/3 KO) were probed with anti-GREB1 antibody, anti-Smad2/3 antibody, and anti-HSP90 antibody. As a result, it was demonstrated that the protein expressions of GREB1 or Smad2/3 disappeared (see e of FIG. 15). In addition, two-dimensional culture (plastic dish culture) of HepG2 cells (WT), GREB1 knockout HepG2 cells (GREB1 KO), or HepG2 cells in which GREB1 and Smad2/3 were knocked out in combination (GREB1 KO/Smad2/3 KO) were performed, and the cell number was counted over time. As a result, since the suppression of cell proliferation by knockout of GREB1 was restored by knockout of Smad2/3, it is revealed that the phenotype is Smad2/3 dependent (see f of FIG. 15). From these results, it is also confirmed that GREB1 can inhibit the suppression of TGF\u03b2 signal-dependent cell proliferation in vivo.",

Specifically, first, from thousands of candidate GREB1 ASOs, those which may have cytotoxicity were excluded, and twenty GREB1 ASO sequences were selected by higher order structure prediction. Based on these selected sequences, GREB1 ASOs with various modifications were designed and synthesized (Table 8).",
                                "Next, HepG2 cells were transfected with control ASO or each of the above-described GREB1 ASOs, cultured in a medium containing 10% FBS for 2 days, and the cell lysates were probed with anti-GREB1 antibody and anti-HSP90 antibody. As a result, among twenty GREB1 ASOs, it was found that ASO-6434, ASO-6921, ASO-6968, and ASO-7724 did not have cytotoxicity, and strongly suppressed GREB1 expression in HepG2 cells (see a of FIG. 17).",
                                "Further, HepG2 cells expressing GFP or GFP-GREB1 were transfected with control ASO or each of the above-described GREB1 ASOs, and cultured in three-dimensional Matrigel for 4 days. The cultured cells were stained with phalloidin and Hoechst33342, and the areas of spheres were calculated (n=50). As a result, ASO-6434, ASO-6921, ASO-6968, and ASO-7724 were capable of preventing sphere-forming activity in HepG2 cells, whereas, in HepG2 cells expressing ASO resistant GREB1 (HepG2 cells expressing GFP-GREB1), the inhibitory effects on the sphere-forming activity of ASO-6921, ASO-6968, and ASO-7724 disappeared (see b of FIG. 16). From these results, it is revealed that at least ASO-6921, ASO-6968, and ASO-7724 prevent sphere formation of HepG2 cells by on-target effect (not by off-target effect).",

Starting from day 3, 50 \u03bcg of control ASO (n=9), GREB1 ASO-6921 (n=5), or GREB1 ASO-7724 (n=6) were subcutaneously administered twice every week. At day 29 from grafting, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were observed. As a result, in both GREB1 ASO-6921 and GREB1 ASO-7724, as compared to control ASO, tumorigenesis by HepG2 cells was suppressed, and the tumor weights were decreased (see c of FIG. 16). Further, mRNA levels of GREB1 and PAI-1 in tumors of each of the livers were analyzed by real-time PCR. In addition, sections of the tumors of each liver were stained with anti-Ki-67 antibody and hematoxylin, and the ratios of the number of Ki-67-positive cells to the number of hematoxylin-positive cells (total cells) were calculated. As a result, it was found that GREB1ASOs-6921 and -7724 suppressed GREB1 expression in tumors of the livers, and reduced the number of Ki-67-positive cells (see d of FIG. 16). Further, sections of the tumors of each liver were stained with anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody and hematoxylin, and the ratios of the number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells to the number of hematoxylin-positive cells (total cells) were calculated. As a result, it was found that apoptosis of tumor cells was induced by GREB1 ASOs-6921 and -7724 (see e of FIG. 16). In addition, when mRNA levels of GREB1 and PAI-1 in the tumors of each of the above-described livers were analyzed by real-time PCR, the PAI-1 gene expression in hepatoblastoma tumor demonstrated a tendency to be increased by GREB1 ASOs-6921 and -7724 (see f of FIG. 16), and it is suggested that proliferation and survival of tumor cells are suppressed by activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling. Further, sections of a nonneoplastic part of each liver were stained with anti-cleaved caspase 3 antibody and hematoxylin. As a result, it was demonstrated that GREB1 ASOs-6921 and -7724 did not induce histological damage or cell death in the nonneoplastic areas of the livers (see b of FIG. 17). From these results, it is revealed that an ASO against GREB1 can be a novel therapeutic drug of hepatoblastoma.",

Appearance of the liver rumors 6 to 7 weeks after grafting was observed, and the ratio of the weight of the liver to the weight of whole body was analyzed. As a result, it was observed that the liver tumorigenesis had a tendency to be suppressed by administration of mGREB1 ASO-5715 (see c of FIG. 17). Further, when GREB1 mRNA levels in tumors of each of the above-described livers were analyzed by real-time PCR, it was demonstrated that the expressions of GREB1 in tumor tissues were suppressed in BMY mice dosed with mGREB1 ASO-5715 (d of FIG. 17).",

GREB1 was highly expressed in, in addition to previously reported breast cancer cell lines, skin cancer (melanoma) cell lines, neuroblastoma cell lines, and some hepatocellular cancer cell lines (see A of FIG. 18). The expressions of GREB1 in SKNDZ cells, CHP212 cells, and NBTU110 cells, which are cells of neuroblastoma cell lines, were analyzed at protein level, and it was demonstrated that the expressions were the same as those in GREB1 high expression HepG2 cells, which are cells of a hepatoblastoma cell line, and higher than those in GREB1 high expression Hep3B cells and JHH7 cells, which are cells of hepatocellular cancer cell lines (see B of FIG. 18). Expressions of GREB1 and \u03b2-catenin in neuroblastoma tissues of 13 cases were analyzed immunohistologically. As described above, in hepatoblastoma, which is a childhood liver cancer, GREB1 is expressed as a downstream target gene of \u03b2-catenin. GREB1 was detected in the nucleus of each of the tumor cells in 4 cases of neuroblastoma (30.7%), and \u03b2-catenin was detected in the cytoplasm or the nucleus in 11 cases (84.6%) (see C of FIG. 18). No significant correlation between the expression of GREB1 and the expression of \u03b2-catenin was demonstrated (see D of FIG. 18). From these results, it is suggested that GREB1 is overexpressed in neuroblastoma cells independent of \u03b2-catenin.",
                                "In neuroblastoma cells, the influence of GREB1 on cell proliferation was investigated. In CHP212 cells, when expression of GREB1 was suppressed using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), cell proliferation under plate culture conditions was suppressed (see E of FIG. 18). From these results, it is revealed that GREB1 is important for cell proliferation in neuroblastoma.",

                                "As described above, in hepatoblastoma, which is a childhood liver cancer, GREB1 is expressed as a downstream target gene of \u03b2-catenin. On the other hand, from the CCLE dataset, it is suggested that GREB1 is highly expressed also in some adult hepatocellular cancer (see A of FIG. 18). Accordingly, expressions of GREB1 and \u03b2-catenin in 210 cases of hepatocellular cancer tissues were analyzed immunohistologically. As a result, there were cases in each of which only GREB1 was highly expressed in the nucleus, cases in each of which only \u03b2-catenin was highly expressed in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, cases in which both GREB1 and \u03b2-catenin were highly expressed, or cases in each of which neither GREB1 nor \u03b2-catenin was expressed (see A of FIG. 19). GREB1 was detected in the nucleus of each of the tumor cells in 73 hepatocellular cancer cases (34.7%), and \u03b2-catenin was detected in the cytoplasm or the nucleus in 93 cases (44.2%) (see B of FIG. 19). Further, there was a significant positive correlation between the expression of GREB1 and the expression of \u03b2-catenin (phi correlation coefficient: 0.41, P value<0.0001) (see B of FIG. 19). In addition, the expressions of GREB1 in Hep3B cells, JHH7 cells, and Huh7 cells, in which expressions of GREB1 are high in the CCLE dataset, and HLE cells and HLF cells, in which expressions of GREB1 are low in the CCLE dataset, were analyzed by Western blotting. As a result, the expression level of GREB1 in Hep3B cells, JHH7 cells, and Huh7 cells, which are hepatocellular cancer cells, were somewhat lower than those in MCF7 cells, which are cells of a GREB1-positive breast cancer cell line, and HepG2 cells, which are cells of a hepatoblastoma cell line, whereas higher than those of Huh6 cells, which are cells of a GREB1 week expression hepatoblastoma cell line. On the other hand, in HLE cells and HLF cells, expression of GREB1 was not observed (see C of FIG. 19). In GREB1 high expression hepatocellular cancer cell lines, \u03b2-catenin-dependency of GREB1 was investigated. When the expressions of \u03b2-catenin were suppressed using siRNA in Hep3B cells, JHH7 cells, and Huh7 cells, the expressions of GREB1 were suppressed in all of these cells (see D of FIG. 19). From these results, it is shown that GREB1 is overexpressed \u03b2-catenin dependently in some hepatocellular cancer cells.",
                                "Next, in hepatocellular cancer cells, the influence of GREB1 on cell proliferation was investigated. In Hep3B and JHH7 cells, when expression of GREB1 was suppressed using siRNA, cell proliferation under plate culture conditions was suppressed (see E of FIG. 19). In addition, for the purpose of elucidating the involvement of GREB1 in in vivo tumorigenesis of hepatocellular cancer, GREB1 knockout Hep3B and JHH7 cells were produced, and xenograft subcutaneous tumorigenesis analysis was performed. As a result, in GREB1 knockout Hep3B cells and JHH7 cells, as compared to control cells, the tumor weights were significantly suppressed 6.5 weeks after grafting (Hep3B cells), and 2 weeks after grafting (JHH7 cells) (see F and G of FIG. 19). From these results, it is revealed that GREB1 plays an important role in cell proliferation of hepatocellular cancer and in vivo tumorigenesis.",

                                "From the CCLE dataset, it is suggested that GREB1 is highly expressed at a high frequency in cutaneous melanoma cells (see A of FIG. 18). Accordingly, the expressions of GREB1 in Mewo cells, SKMEL28 cells, and G361 cells, which are melanoma cell lines in which the expressions of GREB1 are high in the CCLE dataset, were analyzed by Western blotting. As a result. GREB1 was detected around 216 kDa, which corresponds to wild type, in hepatoblastoma cells HepG2 cells, whereas those in all of the melanoma cells were detected around 100 kDa (see A of FIG. 20). Therefore, to elucidate the expressions of transcriptional variants of GREB1, based on the TCGA dataset, exon expressions of GREB1 in breast cancer and cutaneous melanoma were investigated using TCGA SpliceSeq (http://projects.insilico.us.com/TCGASpliceSeq). Four isoforms (isoforms; IS) (transcriptional variants) of GREB1 are registered on The Universal Protein Resource (Uniprot). IS1 is also referred to as GREB1a, and is the full-length form having 1949 amino acids (216 kDa); IS2 is also referred to as GREB1b, and is a transcript, in which amino acids in the C-terminal region at positions 458 to 1949 are deleted, having 457 amino acids (49 kDa); IS3 is also referred to as GREB1c, and is a transcript, in which amino acids in the C-terminal region at positions 410 to 1949 are deleted, having 409 amino acids (43 kDa); and IS4 is a transcript, in which amino acids in the N-terminal region at positions 1 to 1002 are deleted, having 947 amino acids (107 kDa) (see B of FIG. 20). GREB1 consists of 38 exons, and expressions of whole of the protein coding exons (exons 4 to 38) were observed in breast cancer tissues. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that, in cutaneous melanoma, GREB1 was expressed starting from exon 24, and IS4 was specifically expressed (see B of FIG. 20). On the TCGA, cancers expressing IS4 are merely cutaneous and ocular melanomas (data not shown).",
                                "To elucidate the mechanism for regulating expression of GREB1 in cutaneous melanoma, a group of genes having positive correlations with GREB1 in melanomas was identified using the TCGA dataset. Among the genes in the group, top 10 genes having higher correlation coefficients include MITF, and 8 known downstream target genes of MITF (see C of FIG. 20). MITF is a transcription factor that regulates the expressions of melanin biosynthesis system enzyme genes, and regulates differentiations of melanocyte, or retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE), and the like. When the expressions of GREB1 and MITF in human melanoma tissues were analyzed immunohistologically, GREB1 and MITF were coexpressed in the same tumor regions in serial specimens (see D of FIG. 20). From this result, it is suggested that GREB1 can be a target gene of MITF in melanoma. Accordingly, in COLO679 cells, which are cells of GREB1 high expression melanoma cell line, when MITF knockout cells were produced, expression of GREB1 was reduced as compared to that in control cells (see E of FIG. 20).",
                                "In cutaneous melanoma cells, the influence of GREB1 on cell proliferation was investigated. In SKMEL28 cells and COLO679 cells, when expression of GREB1 was suppressed using siRNA (SKMEL28 cells) or an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) (COLO679 cells), cell proliferation under plate culture conditions was suppressed in both cases (see F and G of FIG. 20). From these results, it is revealed that GREB1 IS4 that specifically expressed in cutaneous melanoma is important for cell proliferation of melanoma."
