    "title": "Highly Sensitive Detection of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells by Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification",
    "date": "2022-06-03",
    "abstract": "For safe regenerative medicines, contaminated or remaining tumorigenic undifferentiated cells in cell-derived products must be rigorously assessed through sensitive assays. Although in vitro nucleic acid tests offer particularly sensitive tumorigenicity-associated assays, the human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) detectability is partly constrained by the small input amount of RNA per test. To overcome this limitation, we developed reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays that are highly gene specific and robust against interfering materials. LAMP could readily assay microgram order of input sample per test and detected an equivalent model of 0.00002% hiPSC contamination in a simple one-pot reaction. For the evaluation of cell-derived total RNA, RT-LAMP detected spiked-in hPSCs among hPSC-derived trilineage cells utilizing multiple pluripotency RNAs. We also developed multiplex RT-LAMP assays and further applied for in situ cell imaging, achieving specific co-staining of pluripotency proteins and RNAs. Our attempts uncovered the utility of RT-LAMP approaches for tumorigenicity-associated assays, supporting practical applications of regenerative medicine. Graphical Abstract",

                "Accumulating evidence from pioneering clinical trials and authorization of cell- and tissue-engineered products have demonstrated potential benefits of regenerative medicine. Thus far, a number of legally approved autologous products, (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs], chondrocytes, antigen presenting cells, limbal stem cells, neural cells, and epidermal or cardiac cell sheets) and approved allogeneic materials (e.g., MSCs, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and epidermal cell sheets) are used in regenerative medicine. Among various cell sources for regenerative medicine, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which include human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells, are attractive cell therapy materials due to their massive growth capacity and unlimited differentiation capability. Currently, more than 30 clinical trials using hPSC-derived cell therapy products are ongoing worldwide [1, 2].",
                "The safety and reliability of cell-derived materials in clinical applications requires prudent tumorigenicity risk assessments, which are mandatory and crucial especially for hPSC-derived materials, because undifferentiated hPSCs have the potential risk of teratoma formation [3, 4]. Under supportive conditions for tumor growth, hundreds of hPSCs were demonstrated to cause teratoma formation in an immunodeficient model mice [4\u20136]. Therefore, undifferentiated cells that stubbornly remain after the differentiation process indicate that there are considerable risks of hPSC applications. For treatments requiring a vast number of cells, such as 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 or more cells [7] for heart failure [8], acute graft versus host disease [9], and liver failure treatment [10], the detection of minor undifferentiated cells in hPSC-derived end materials is extremely difficult. To overcome these tumorigenicity issues, novel technologies have been developed to remove undifferentiated cells or accumulating differentiated cells [3, 11\u201315]. As for in vitro detection of undifferentiated cells, culture assay [16] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based nucleic acid tests quantitating pluripotency marker RNAs [17\u201319] have achieved sensitive undifferentiated cell detection. Nucleic acid tests can be performed in a day, and thus excel in test rapidity and throughput, whereas culture assays require days of cultivation for undifferentiated cell colony formation.",
                "For some methods of undifferentiated hPSC detection, the detection sensitivities are partly constrained by the upper limits of the available experimental scale or by limits of the input sample amount. For example, the sensitivity of a culture assay for undifferentiated cell detection could be improved but might adversely impact the expense, time, and throughputs if cells are seeded into more plates, undifferentiated cells are concentrated through cell sorting, or differentiated cells are eliminated with apoptosis-inducible systems [20, 21]. Although these approaches imply that the sensitivity of the in vitro nucleic acid test could be improved by increasing the input amount of the sample, a conventional PCR is not ideal for testing a large amount of nucleic acids in a single reaction. For general quantitative PCR (qPCR), excessive input of nucleic acids is not recommended because too much nucleic acids causes nonspecific DNA amplification and/or a decrease in PCR efficiency that is far below the ideal two-folds per cycle. In the case of emerging digital PCR platforms, which are robust to interfering substances [22], the analytical performance is exacerbated as the input sample increases, and, in addition, highly depends on the desirable quantitative range and the occurrence of false-positive droplets, which lead to laborious validation assays and threshold selection [23\u201325].",
                "Thus, for more precise, accurate, and sensitive detection of undifferentiated cells, we explored another nucleic acid amplification method capable of detecting subtle target RNAs among a vast amount of interfering substances and then determined that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [26] is the optimal solution. LAMP is known to be robust against interfering material due to the use of thermostable DNA polymerase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst), which possesses strong DNA strand displacement activity. Furthermore, four primers that recognize six regions on a target nucleic acid insure highly specific target amplifications. Besides, the simple addition of thermostable reverse transcriptase enables rapid one-pot RNA detection by reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP). Although LAMP is specialized to qualitative assays, the simple and rapid DNA amplification procedure enables a wide range of applications, including digital assays [27], lateral flow assays [28], and in situ target amplification. LAMP is especially suitable for the diagnosis of infectious disease as this technique has been adapted for the pulmonary tuberculosis detection kit recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) [29].",
                "In this study, we aimed to establish a more sensitive and robust nucleic acid test platform for the detection of undifferentiated cells by increasing the input amount of the sample. Through evaluations using various combinations of pluripotency marker RNAs and differentiated cells, the adaptability of RT-LAMP for the tumorigenicity-associated test was investigated."

Reverse transcription was performed at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and, subsequently, an isothermal amplification was performed for 70\u00a0min. Fluorescence was measured through the amplification phase, and the threshold time values (Tt values) were determined by the time at which the baseline subtracted fluorescence intensity reached to\u2009\u2212\u20091, except that of the multiplexed LINC00678 reached to\u2009\u2212\u20090.5, which reflected the probe annealing and quenching of fluorescent dye. For the multiplexed assay, Tt values were also determined based on the fluorescence increase of SYTO 63 intercalator by setting the threshold at 0.5. Tt values were set at 0 when the fluorescence did not reach the threshold intensity during reaction; instead, those were set at 80 (=\u200910\u2009+\u200970) for nonparametric statistical analysis to rank data appropriately. The detailed buffer and reaction condition of LAMP is summarized in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.

                        "To detect a subtle target molecule by distinguishing it from a vast amount of nontargets, the input amount of sample should be increased so as not to lose targets. Due to the cell-based environment (Fig.\u00a01A), we hypothesized that the sensitivity and reproducibility of nucleic acid tests could be improved by maximizing the input amount of sample so long as the test results are not influenced by the interferents. However, due to the obvious exacerbations of qPCR quantitativity in conditions with more than 1\u00a0\u00b5g interfering nucleic acids per test (Figs. 1B\u00a0and 1C), we constructed RT-LAMP assays (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01\u00a0shows the principle) anticipating sensitive and specific target amplification from a vast number of interfering materials. Indeed, the comparison of qPCR and LAMP clearly showed the superiority of LAMP in detecting 50 and 500 copies of targets even in the presence of 10\u00a0\u00b5g interfering nontarget nucleic acids in a mere 25 \u00b5L reaction volume (Figs. 1D\u00a0and 1E).",

Generally, the mass of total RNA in a human cell is known to be 10\u201330\u00a0pg [38], although this estimation depends on the cell type [39]. Thus, we assumed the amount to be 10\u00a0pg total RNA per cell, and 100 copies of the target were spiked into 100\u00a0\u03bcg interfering nucleic acids, modeling two hiPSCs contamination per 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 differentiated cells. This sample was assessed by LAMP and resulted in positive reaction, which indicated the LAMP could detect 0.00002% hiPSC contamination (Fig.\u00a01F). This robustness against interfering materials to achieve sensitive and specific target detection and the scalability of the isothermal reaction suggested a novel LAMP application for tumorigenicity-associated assays of cell-derived materials."

In hiPSC-derived HE, MC, and EC, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28A, the representative pluripotency RNAs, were not applicable for sensitive detection of residual undifferentiated cells because the expressions of these RNAs remain high in these cells, which hinders sensitive hPSC detection. However, ESRG and SFRP2, which are the pluripotency marker genes that are useful for qPCR-based assays, had lower expressions in these differentiated cells [17] (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02C). These findings reminded us of the utility of pluripotency marker genes, which have little or no expression in desired differentiated cells.",

This screening revealed the utility of PR/SET domain 14 (PRDM14) and long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 678 (LINC00678) for RT-qPCR assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Specifically, the expression of LINC00678 was subtle in all assessed differentiated cells, which indicates its potential as another reliable marker (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02C and 2D). In addition, these genes were commonly and highly expressed in the seven hiPSC strains, which suggested wide adaptability of the markers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05).",
                        "Subsequently, we simulated hiPSC detection sensitivity to estimate the advantage of increasing the input amount of RNA per test by RT-LAMP in comparison with RT-qPCR. Pluripotency markers with extremely high expression in hiPSC, like SFRP2 and LIN28A, would be more than 50 copies per hiPSC, whereas other pluripotency markers of interest would be more than 5 copies per hiPSC. Regarding those expressions in differentiated cells, markers that are expressed extremely low, like ESRG and LINC00678, could be less than 1 copy per 105 differentiated cells, whereas other pluripotency markers could be less than 1 copy per 104 differentiated cells.",

With RT-LAMP, we can control positive/negative cutoff copy number of target RNA per test between approximately 10 and 1,000 copies per test by adjusting the reaction buffer (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07) and temperature conditions [42]. This adjustability of the qualitative LAMP cutoff would enable 0% hiPSC contamination to be distinguished as negative and 0.001% contamination as positive based on several marker genes if the RT-LAMP assays were performed with 5\u00a0\u00b5g total RNA per test (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06)."

In our routine HE, MC, and EC differentiation processes, no residual undifferentiated cells were observed when culturing the commonly used hiPSC strains [35]. Thus, we employed the over-passed hiPSC as a model strain, which tends to induce the remaining undifferentiated cells in our HE differentiation process [35] and compared the results of the culture assay, RT-qPCR, and RT-LAMP targeting three pluripotency marker genes, ESRG, LINC00678, and PRDM14.",

Based on the observed colony number, the residual rates of undifferentiated cells were calculated (Supplementary Table 7), although the culture assay may have some quantitative limitations because not all the seeded undifferentiated cells form colonies, especially when the number of residual undifferentiated cells was small [43]. In this condition, RT-qPCR did not distinguish some residual undifferentiated cells, particularly if they comprised below 0.1% of the seeded cells, likely due to low target RNA copy numbers per test and measurement error in this low copy number range (Fig.\u00a02). However, RT-LAMP assays, whose cutoffs were set between 100 and 1,000 copies per test (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07), clearly discriminated between samples containing no undifferentiated cells and samples containing 0.001% or more undifferentiated cells, benefiting from the 80-fold greater RNA input per test than RT-qPCR.Fig. 2Discrimination between HE with and without residual undifferentiated cells by RT-LAMP. A Normal hiPSC and over-passed hiPSC were differentiated into HE and tested by culture assay, RT-qPCR, and RT-LAMP. The residual undifferentiated cells per HE ratio determined by culture assay are shown below the bars.

                        "To confirm the hiPSC detectability of our RT-LAMP systems, we compared the sensitivity between RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assays by using total RNA extracted from differentiated cells containing spiked-in hiPSCs. Firstly, serially diluted hiPSCs were spiked into hiPSC-derived endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells. To optimize the RT-LAMP conditions, the reaction conditions were finely tuned for each target gene and cell so as to discriminate the hiPSC spiked-in samples from hiPSC-free samples. By inputting 5\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA per test, we determined the RT-LAMP conditions that could detect 0.001% hiPSC contamination (Fig.\u00a03A). RT-qPCR using the same RNA samples further revealed the superior hiPSC detection sensitivity of RT-LAMP in concordance with our above simulation results (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).Fig. 3Sensitive detection of spiked hiPSC among hiPSC-derived HE, MC, EC, or NPC by RT-LAMP. hiPSC was spiked into hiPSC-derived cells and then extracted total RNA were assayed by RT-qPCR using 30\u00a0ng per test and RT-LAMP using 5\u00a0\u03bcg per test (N\u2009=\u20093 biological replicates\u2009\u00d7\u20093 replicate measurements, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD values for RT-qPCR and median values for RT-LAMP, Tukey\u2013Kramer test vs. 0% of each cell lot for RT-qPCR, *: p\u2009<\u20090.05, **: p\u2009<\u20090.01, Shirley\u2013Williams test vs. 0% of each cell lot for RT-LAMP, \u2020: p\u2009<\u20090.05, \u2021: p\u2009<\u20090.01). For RT-LAMP, each target gene was analyzed (A) by probe detection, whereas ESRG and LINC00678 were multiplexed in (B), and the Tt values were determined based on the fluorescence of SYTO63 intercalator",
                        "Subsequently, because we anticipated that RT-LAMP is also applicable for the evaluation of a wide range of differentiated cells, 293\u00a0T and HeLa cells were additionally examined as model human differentiated cells, assuming that cross-contamination of cells had occurred [44, 45]. This investigation also indicated the high sensitivity of RT-LAMP and that proper pluripotency marker selection enables the evaluation of faint hiPSC contamination in various cell-derived materials in addition to hPSC-derived materials (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08).",
                        "Finally, for more robust detection of undifferentiated cells, we developed a multiplex RT-LAMP assay targeting ESRG and LINC00678, keeping the high detection sensitivity without any nonspecific amplification nor nonspecific probe hybridization (Fig.\u00a03B). In these multiplexed measurements, although we anticipated obtaining either ESRG(\u2009+)/LINC00678(\u2009\u2212) or ESRG(\u2009\u2212)/LINC00678(\u2009+) wells as positive wells as the two genes are amplified competitively in each well, some ESRG(\u2009+)/LINC00678(\u2009+) wells were also observed, especially in samples containing more spiked-in hiPSCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), which possibly reflected the balanced abundance of the two targets in extracted RNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02B). Altogether, through assessing more than 1\u00a0\u03bcg of total RNA per test, RT-LAMP achieved a highly sensitive detection of undifferentiated cells among various differentiated cells, which indicated the applicability of RT-LAMP for tumorigenicity-associated assay."

                        "As a further application, the advantages of LAMP and the extremely low expressions of pluripotency marker RNAs in differentiated cells indicated that imaging-based detection of hPSCs was viable. The robustness against interference and high specificity of LAMP enabled in situ detection of nucleic acids originating from pathogens and physical disorders [46\u201348]. Compared with in situ PCR, a relatively mild isothermal reaction could be performed with simple apparatuses and presumably circumvents heat damage to the biological analytes. Thus, we supposed in situ RT-LAMP could detect undifferentiated cell colonies among hiPSC-derived differentiated cells in the culture assay process, as well as immunostaining of pluripotency protein markers.",
                        "In the process of condition screening, we found that immunostaining of the five pluripotency marker proteins, OCT4A, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA4, and TRA1-81, produced substantial fluorescent signals after the 2-h heat treatment necessary for RT-LAMP. Thus, we co-stained the various combinations of pluripotency proteins and DIG- or fluorolabelled LAMP amplicons for the specific detection of undifferentiated cells (Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). Intriguingly, some undifferentiated cell colonies were labeled nonuniformly in a speckled manner by in situ RT-LAMP (Fig.\u00a04A\u00a0and Supplementary Fig.\u00a010C), which possibly reflected the focally exponential target amplification in the later amplification steps of LAMP (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). These specific undifferentiated cell labeling techniques further convinced the sensitivity and specificity of our LAMP constructs and the specific abundance of pluripotency marker RNAs in undifferentiated cells.Fig. 4Specific detection of undifferentiated cells by in situ RT-LAMP. Undifferentiated cell colony detection by immunostaining and/or in situ RT-LAMP in the culture assay process visualizing DIG-labeled (A), double (B), or triple (C) fluorolabelled LAMP amplicons. In (A) and (B), pluripotency marker proteins were co-stained by immunostaining (Scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcm.). The whole well images are also shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a010. Compared to EC and colonies of hiPSC, HE and MC showed weaker DAPI signal presumably because these cells could not adapt to AK02 media during the incubation for undifferentiated cell colony formation"

                "Among various hazardous impurities in cell-derived materials for regenerative medicine treatment, the detection of tumorigenic undifferentiated cells requires sensitivity improvements due to their risk and rare proportion in the desired material. We hypothesized that an increase of input sample per test would enhance the detection sensitivity of an in vitro assay and explored nucleic acid amplification strategies alternative to PCR. We focused on the unique characteristics of LAMP, developed RT-LAMP systems that target six pluripotency marker RNAs, and achieved sensitive detection of undifferentiated cells among hiPSC-derived endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells.",
                "The hiPSC detection sensitivity of in vitro RT-LAMP assay is presumed to be at least 0.00002%, and higher sensitivity can be achieved by maximizing the input RNA amount. Using hiPSC-derived cells and model differentiated cell lines with several marker RNAs, the hiPSC detection sensitivity was 0.001%, which was more sensitive compared with that of RT-qPCR [17] and was comparable with the reported digital RT-PCR assays targeting LIN28A or TDGF1 [18, 19], with the simple and rapid one-pot assay process. In addition, the sensitive multiplexed assay and specific in situ RT-LAMP labeling of undifferentiated cells further clarified the utility of pluripotency marker RNAs and RT-LAMP. Our attempts indicated a novel solution for simple and sensitive evaluations of hPSC contamination in cell-derived products and residual undifferentiated cells among hPSC-derived materials.",
                "Our group is preparing for clinical trials involving a liver failure treatment using all hiPSC-derived liver buds (LBs). Based on the coculture technology of hiPSC-derived HE, MC, and EC [49], mass production of LB organoids through chemically defined animal origin-free differentiation has been achieved [35, 50]. As the transplanted LBs consisted of 108\u20131010 cells to be engrafted on the recipients\u2019 liver for years, the tumorigenicity risk has been cautiously assessed through functional evaluation of LBs and validation of operational procedures using mice, rat, and porcine models [51, 52]. Furthermore, based on the in vitro assays, the use of pluripotency markers and RT-LAMP presented in this study further ensures the safe application of our LBs.",
                "We utilized RT-LAMP assay targeting six pluripotency RNA markers and assessed six types of differentiated cells, which indicates the wide adaptability of this technique for the evaluation of various cell-derived materials. Because the expression level of each pluripotency marker RNA would widely differ among cell therapy products, prior marker gene selection would be mandatory for any nucleic acid tests. In this study, the RNA detection sensitivity\u2014alternatively, the qualitative cutoff copy number of RNA\u2014of RT-LAMP was deliberately determined for each marker gene and differentiated cell to discriminate between 0.001% and no hiPSC contamination. Nevertheless, for more practical assay development toward regulatory science, the cutoff values could be set beforehand for each marker gene from the risk and hazard perspectives of each cell therapy product; for instance, at 50 copies per 5\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA or at 50 copies per 1\u00a0\u03bcg total RNA, which exceed the general measurement ranges of qPCR and digital PCR. In principle, although the LAMP approaches have the potential to achieve 0.00002% or a more sensitive detection limit of undifferentiated cells, the sensitivity improvement was mainly hindered by the slight expression of pluripotency marker RNA from the differentiated cells used in hiPSC spike-in assays. To repress these background expressions, further refinements to the differentiation protocol [34] or simple techniques for the elimination of intermediate and immature cells would be effective. Plus, additional LAMP buffer condition screening would enable increase of input amount of RNA to improve sensitivity and reproducibility.",
                "Further technical improvement of RT-LAMP tumorigenicity-associated tests could involve a more rational selection of primer positions to optimize performance. Some pluripotency genes, such as OCT4 and NANOG, are known to have many pseudogenes and/or their cognate sequences all over the genome and those expression of RNA variants could be altered in a differentiation-dependent manner [53, 54]. Among the pluripotency marker RNAs assessed by LAMP, ESRG, LINC00678, PRDM14, and LIN28A have such homologous sequences on the genome that those transcripts might affect the performance of nucleic acid tests. Further, cutting-edge single-cell transcriptome studies revealed not only transitions of RNA expression but also alterations of RNA structures, including splicing variants and splicing intermediates, along hPSC differentiation [55, 56]. These differences in RNA structure throughout the cell differentiation process could refine RNA-based assays; we located the PCR and LAMP primers for USP44 at exon1-2 junction [57] and for PRDM14 at exon2-3 junction [58], which are more abundant in hPSCs than in differentiated or matured cells based on RNA structural studies [59]. Additional accumulations of single-cell and long-read RNA sequence data will support the discovery of novel pluripotency marker genes and their appropriate primer positions.",
                "Although RT-LAMP offers simple and sensitive in vitro tumorigenicity-associated tests, the requisition for a large amount of RNA might limit its use, especially for cell therapy products that require a small number of cells and are prepared at small scales. In contrast, this technique would be preferable for products that are manufactured in large batches, such as allogenic cell products, or when large numbers of cells are used to treat patients. Altogether, qPCR, digital PCR, LAMP, and other nucleic acid amplification methods possess different pros and cons [60], and their usage should be determined comprehensively.",
                "Because regulatory science in regenerative medicine field requires handling various cell therapy products and creating innovative evaluation technologies, further interdisciplinary collaboration would lead to remarkable solutions. In particular, an increase in the input amount samples or an efficient scale up of assays would be a pivotal approach for the sensitive measurement of subtle target analytes. Although LAMP assays have been used globally in the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases, genotyping, food safety, and environmental assessment [61\u201367], this study is the first to apply the LAMP approach to regenerative medicine, which paves the way for novel applications of isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods. The use of LAMP assays is not limited to undifferentiated cell detection but would be applicable for various evaluations of a wide range of cell materials used in industries like Chinese hamster ovary, baby hamster kidney, or Vero cells, and those treated for human like chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) or blood cells through sensitive and specific target detection."
