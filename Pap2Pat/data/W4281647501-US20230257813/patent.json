A method for detecting presence or absence of undifferentiated cells in a non-undifferentiated cell population, wherein RNA derived from an undifferentiation marker gene exhibiting a significant difference in expression level between the undifferentiated cells and the non-undifferentiated cells in a sample containing a nucleic acid derived from the cell population of interest is detected by the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. The kit for detecting presence or absence of undifferentiated cells in a non-undifferentiated cell population comprises a reagent with which RNA derived from an undifferentiation marker gene exhibiting a significant difference in expression level between the undifferentiated cells and the non-undifferentiated cells is detected by the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method.",

                        "Technical requirements for ensuring the quality and safety of products processed from human cells among regenerative medical products are stipulated in a plurality of guidelines (Non-Patent Document No. 1). Transplantation and administration of the final products to humans pose a risk of tumorigenesis due to residual undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, since such products are processed from human pluripotent stem cells having tumorigenicity as in the case of products processed from human embryonic stem cells (human ES cells) and products processed from human induced pluripotent stem cells (human iPS cells).",
                        "In order to prevent the contamination with undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells (hereinafter referred to as undifferentiated cells), it is required to increase the abundance rate of cells of interest by improving the differentiation efficiency (setting differentiation conditions such as medium components, cytokines and growth factors) and to eliminate the contaminating undifferentiated cells through enrichment\u22c5purification steps (e.g., selective separation using antibodies or lectins) as necessary. At the same time, for the practical application of therapeutic means for transplanting\u22c5administering a regenerative medical product, to humans, a test method for confirming the removal and remaining of undifferentiated cells is indispensable, and the ability to detect undifferentiated cells with the highest possible sensitivity is strongly required.",
                        "For the detection of residual undifferentiated cells in the intermediate products and/or final products of regenerative medical products, evaluation by an in vitro test of detecting specific molecular markers is effective. Examples of the method include not only a flow cytometry method utilizing the presence or absence of a specific antigen on the cell surface and a method for detecting molecular markers (e.g., podocalyxin, laminin and CD30, Non-Patent Document Nos. 2, 3 and 4) in the culture supernatants, but also quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, hereinafter qRT-PCR method, (Non-Patent Document No. 5) that targets genes confirmed to exhibit high-level expression in undifferentiated cells and a digital PCR method (Non-Patent Document No. 6). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR method), which is the basis of the qRT-PCR method and the digital PCR method, is theoretically capable of exponentially amplifying a target DNA level by repeating 25 to 40 times the three-step temperature changes: 1) thermal denaturation (94\u00b0 C. to 98\u00b0 C., 30 seconds, etc.)\u21922) primer annealing (50\u00b0 C. to 65\u00b0 C., 30 seconds, etc.)\u21923) extension reaction (68\u00b0 C. to 72\u00b0 C., 60 seconds, etc.). The amount of products amplified by the PCR method can also be quantitatively analyzed using probes labeled with fluorescent dyes etc., since the amount of PCR products correlates both with the amount of a template nucleic acid in a sample and the number of reaction cycles. Hence, the PCR method is recognized as a standard technique for gene amplification and specifically as a method capable of amplifying a small amount of a template nucleic acid in a relatively short period of time.",
                        "However, even if the qRT-PCR method, which is known as a sensitive method, is used for the detection of undifferentiation marker genes, the quantification and/or determination accuracy is not sufficient. This is because the number of the molecules of a target undifferentiation marker gene in the intermediate product and/or final product of a regenerative medical product, is so small that the amplification efficiency of the target molecule decrease, and that exponential amplification is hindered. In such a case, it is possible to ensure amplification efficiency by increasing the quantity of nucleic acids per reaction to increase the number of target molecules, but in the case of the qRT-PCR method with a typical liquid volume, the upper limit should be about 100 ng per reaction. This is because the amplification reaction is inhibited and non-specific amplification occurs as the amount of contaminating nucleic acids increases. In order to increase the quantity of nucleic acids beyond this upper limit, it is necessary to increase the reaction solution volume per reaction. However, the general PCR reaction is not preferable since in order to perform the above-mentioned three-step temperature changes quickly and accurately, the reaction solution volume is limited to about 5 \u03bcL to 100 \u03bcL at which the reaction tube fits in the thermal block on the thermal cycler as a dedicated device.",
                        "PCR is a reaction that has conventionally been performed in a single container, but digital PCR involves distributing a nucleic acid sample into microcompartments (oil droplets, etc.) to perform limiting dilution, followed by a nucleic acid amplification reaction, and is attracting attention as a method for quantifying the number of molecules of a target nucleic acid using a statistical technique. However, digital PCR has disadvantages such as the need for a special and expensive dedicated device and the high test cost, and thus has not been widely used.",
                        "Further, in facilities for handling multiple types of cells and cells derived from multiple individuals (cell donors), the presence or absence of cell contamination is analyzed by SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis, but contamination of cells of the same individual, for example, cross-contamination of undifferentiated cells into differentiated cells cannot be detected by SNPs analysis.",
                        "In numerous attempts to improve the PCR method, which is a standard nucleic acid amplification method, an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method has been developed, in which an amplification reaction is rapidly carried out under mild temperature conditions and by which a nucleic acid is amplified with high efficiency. As methods capable of amplifying nucleic acids under constant temperature conditions, multiple methods have been reported and they include, for example, a LAMP method (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification, Patent Document No. 1), a NASBA method (Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification, Patent Document Nos. 2 and 3), an SDA method (Strand Displacement Amplification, Patent Document No. 4), a TRC method (Transcription Reverse-transcription Concerted reaction, Patent Document No. 5), and an ICAN method (Isothermal and Chimeric primer-initiated Amplification of Nucleic acids, Patent Document No. 6). The respective methods have their own features, such as the one requiring multiple enzymes, the one limited in the types of template nucleic acids, and the one requiring special primers such as chimeric primers, so an optimum method should be selected according to the purpose.",
                        "All of these methods have an advantage of not requiring strict temperature control unlike the PCR method, because an amplification reaction in these methods proceeds continuously at a constant temperature (40\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C.). However, at the present time, there is no report that a method for detecting an undifferentiation marker gene with high sensitivity has been established by taking advantage of the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method."

                                "The present inventors have focused on the fact that in the PCR method, in which dissociation and polymerization are repeated with changes in reaction temperature, [1] the reaction solution volume is limited in order to control changes in reaction temperature quickly and accurately, and the quantity of a nucleic acid sample cannot be increased, and [2] when a large amount of nucleic acids other than target nucleic acids is brought in, non-specific nucleic acid amplification may occur, or nucleic acid amplification and detection may be inhibited. The present inventors have considered that through the use of an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method capable of nucleic acid amplification with high specificity and high amplification efficiency under constant temperature conditions, the reaction solution volume can be increased and undifferentiation marker genes can be specifically detected even when a large amount of nucleic acids other than target nucleic acids is brought in. As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have established a sensitive and simple detection method for detecting residual undifferentiated cells in the intermediate products and/or final products of regenerative medical products, through detection of undifferentiation marker genes that are expressed at high levels in undifferentiated cells by the LAMP method.

                        "In the present invention, undifferentiated cells are preferably human or non-human mammalian cells having pluripotency. For example, undifferentiated cells are at least one type of pluripotent stem cells selected from the group consisting of embryonic carcinoma cells (EC cells), embryonic stem cells (ES cells), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), embryonic germ cells (EG cells), somatic (tissue) stem cells, and the like.",
                        "In the present invention, non-undifferentiated cells may be any cells that can be distinguished from undifferentiated cells. Examples of the non-undifferentiated cells can include cells that are derived from pluripotent stem cells and which do not remain in the initial state as undifferentiated cells but are \u201cwell-differentiated cells\u201d and \u201ccells in the process of differentiation\u201d into cells of interest (e.g., hepatocytes, vascular endothelial cells, nerve cells, etc.) The degree of differentiation of \u201ccells in the process of differentiation\u201d is not critical and the non-undifferentiated cells may be cells differentiated to such an extent that they are destined to differentiate into cells of interest, or they may be differentiated to such an extent that they are yet to be destined to differentiate into cells of interest. The non-undifferentiated cells may be \u201ccells constituting a cell population in various states such as cells that are fully differentiated and cells that are still in the process of differentiation, on the way to differentiation into cells of interest (e.g., hepatocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and nerve cells)\u201d.

Such RNA derived from an undifferentiation marker gene exhibiting a significant difference in expression level between undifferentiated cells and non-undifferentiated cells may be any RNA that has a significant difference in expression level between undifferentiated cells and non-undifferentiated cells, and is preferably RNA showing a decrease in expression level with the passage of time as the differentiation process proceeds. For example, on the basis of the quantitative analysis data obtained by qRT-PCR, the presence or absence of a significant difference can be identified by determining a p value of less than 0.05 as the presence of a significant difference when the significance level is set to 5% in the Student's t test.",
                        "In the method of the present invention for detecting the presence or absence of undifferentiated cells in a non-undifferentiated cell population, it is desirable to detect RNA whose expression level is decreased in the differentiation process, and further, the decrease in expression level is desirably a remarkable one. In a test for the purpose of denying the contamination with undifferentiated cells, which requires sensitive detection performance, the higher the expression level of RNA to be detected in undifferentiated cells, the better, and what is more, the lower the RNA expression level in non-undifferentiated cells, the better. Specifically:",
                        "the ratio of the expression level of an RNA in undifferentiated cells to the RNA expression level in non-undifferentiated cells is desirably 104 times or more, more desirably 105 times or more, and most desirably 106 times or more; and/or the RNA expression level in non-undifferentiated cells is desirably 1\u00d7104 copies or less per \u03bcg of total RNA level, more desirably 1\u00d7103 copies or less, even more desirably 1\u00d7102 copies or less, further desirably 1\u00d710 copies or less, and ideally the number of copies is close to zero. Specific examples of RNA that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, LINC00678, SFRP2, PRDM14, USP44, ESRG, CNMD, LIN28A, SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, TDGF1, and TNFRSF8, as well as known genes disclosed in papers etc. to exhibit high expression levels in undifferentiated cells but low expression levels in non-undifferentiated cells, as determined by transcriptome analysis and by a quantitative PCR method.",
                        "Note that RNA may be RNA transcribed from genomic DNA (in the case of eukaryotes, genomic DNA possessed by organelles such as the mitochondrial genome is also included herein), which may be further modified or processed RNA after transcription, as exemplified by microRNA or circular RNA. Furthermore, such RNA may be RNA not encoding a protein, or may be a partial decomposition product of RNA containing a target sequence for nucleic acid amplification. The genome may be any one of the following: a region encoding a protein, a region encoding a transcriptional regulatory region such as a promoter or an enhancer, and a non-coding region other than these regions.",
                        "A difference in the RNA expression level of an undifferentiation marker gene between non-undifferentiated cells and undifferentiated cells, which is specifically described in the above section, can be described by the following calculation conditions (simulation).",
                        "Factors that determine the method by which undifferentiated cells present in trace amounts can be detected with high sensitivity are [1] the quantity of nucleic acids per reaction, [2] the RNA expression level of an undifferentiation marker gene, [3] the percentage of undifferentiated cells.",
                        "[1] In the quantity of nucleic acids per reaction, the culture status of a non-undifferentiated cell population as a test sample and the number of cells collected, the extraction rate of a nucleic acid sample in the extraction operation after cell collection, and the degree of purification and the concentration rate are involved. On the other hand, it is known that there is a certain limit on the quantity of nucleic acids per reaction in the gene amplification reaction. In the PCR method well known for gene amplification reactions in genetic testing, a great excess quantity of nucleic acids is known to inhibit the PCR reaction and interfere with the detection of target products. Factors responsible for this include a decrease in the function of polymerase due to the depletion of magnesium ions that contribute to the structural stabilization of nucleic acid, and a delay in the single-strand formation of a nucleic acid sample due to heat denaturation. Therefore, in PCR, in the case of human genomic DNA, a maximum of 500 ng (0.5 \u03bcg) per reaction is set as a guide for the upper limit of the quantity per reaction. In addition, in the case of the qRT-PCR method with a typical liquid volume intended for quantification, the upper limit is about 100 ng per reaction. For this reason, in the PCR reaction, the quantity of nucleic acids per reaction is limited to a small value, so it is difficult to further increase the limit of detection (LOD) of the percentage of undifferentiated cells. As a feature of the method of the present invention, it is required that nucleic acid samples derived from a cell population that may contain undifferentiated cells be subjected to a single genetic test in the largest possible amounts. Hence, a test method that is not inhibited or is not easily inhibited by a great excess quantity of nucleic acid samples is desired.\n\n[2] Regarding the expression level of an undifferentiation marker gene, RNA is desirably derived from a gene whose RNA expression level significantly changes in the process of the formation and specialization (differentiation) of cells, tissues, organs, and individuals from the state of undifferentiated cells. Specifically, RNA desired herein shows a decrease in expression level in the process of differentiation, with the decrease in its expression level being a remarkable change (high expression level in undifferentiated cells and low expression level in differentiated cells).",
                        "In the case of a gene having such a property that the RNA expression level remains unchanged or hardly changes in the differentiation process of non-undifferentiated cells as a test sample, the progress of the differentiation process or the percentage of undifferentiated cells cannot be confirmed even by a measurement system capable of quantifying the RNA expression level.",
                        "Further, if a gene expresses at no or trace RNA level in cells in an undifferentiated state, such a gene is not suitable as a marker in a test for denying the contamination with the slightest amount of undifferentiated cells having tumorigenicity.",
                        "As described above, requirements for the marker gene in the present invention are a high RNA expression level in undifferentiated cells and a low RNA expression level in differentiated cells. Moreover, it is further desired that a decrease in RNA expression level in the differentiation process is remarkable.",
                        "[3] The model case is shown below with specific figures in the range of undifferentiated cell percentage from 0.1% (1\u00d710\u22123) to 0%.",
                        "As an example, the RNA expression levels of a marker gene in undifferentiated cells and in the process of differentiation into non-undifferentiated cells are set as shown in the following conditions."

                                "Note that the test method based on the gene amplification method represented by PCR is a method that involves specifically amplifying a target sequence contained in a test sample and detecting the same after amplification or simultaneously with amplification; the detection sensitivity of this method is represented by the number of target sequence copies per reaction. Theoretically, an amplification reaction proceeds from one copy/test, and the test method is known as one that exhibits high sensitivity and high specificity. This property is shared by the LAMP method, which is one of the gene amplification methods. Clinical diagnostic test reagents (commercially available products) for the LAMP method are characterized by a minimum detection sensitivity of 10 copies/test (e.g., Loopamp SARS coronavirus detection reagent kit). In this way, in infectious disease tests that involve amplifying and detecting specific nucleotide sequences derived from pathogenic microorganisms, sensitive detection performance at the level of several copies/test is required. However, by varying the conditions for the reaction composition including the nucleotide sequences of primers to be used, the amount of primers, and the concentrations of substrates, enzymes and catalysts therefor, the detection sensitivity can also be adjusted from 10 copies/test to several thousand copies/test. In other words, the detection sensitivity of the tests is variable depending on the various conditions involved in the reaction. In particular, in the method of the present invention, it is possible to provide a method of adjusting the detection sensitivity via a reaction substrate (e.g., dNTPs).",

For example, in a reaction composition including a small number of template nucleic acid copies (e.g., 10 copies per test) and with the concentration of reaction substrates (dNTPs) being used as a sole variable parameter (for example, 0.5 mM to 2.5 mM), the presence or absence of amplification reaction and reaction rate are tested within a certain period of time (e.g., 90 minutes) after the start of the test. In this case, it can be said that the earlier the start of the amplification reaction (for example, within 20 minutes), the more optimum or the closer to the optimum the concentration of the substrates. Based on such tests, the optimum concentration of sensitively detectable substrates (dNTPs) can be determined.",

In a test intended for denying the contamination with undifferentiated cells, which requires sensitive detection performance, the higher the expression level of RNA to be detected in undifferentiated cells, the better, and what is more, the lower the expression level of RNA in non-undifferentiated cells, the better. Specifically, the ratio of the RNA expression level in undifferentiated cells to that in non-undifferentiated cells is desirably 104 times or more, more desirably 105 times or more, and most desirably 106 times or more. Further, the RNA expression level in non-undifferentiated cells is desirably 1\u00d7104 copies or less per \u03bcg of total RNA level, more desirably 1\u00d7103 copies or less, still more desirably 1\u00d7102 copies or less, even more desirably 1\u00d710 copies or less, and ideally the number of copies is close to zero.",

At this time, the number of RNA copies of an undifferentiation marker gene per reaction increases by a larger increment in non-undifferentiated cells containing undifferentiated cells than in non-undifferentiated cells containing no undifferentiated cells.

Among these methods, a method like the LAMP method in which nucleic acid amplification is performed with high specificity and efficiently is preferable. Hereinafter, the LAMP method will be described as a specific example, but the method is not particularly limited thereto as long as it is a nucleic acid amplification method having the same features. When nucleic acid amplification is performed targeting RNA by the LAMP method (RT-LAMP method), at least six regions of a nucleic acid (cDNA) synthesized from the template of RNA to be detected are amplified isothermally using at least four different primers, and DNA polymerase having a strand displacement activity (which may hereinafter sometimes be referred to as \u201cstrand displacement type DNA polymerase\u201d) is used for nucleic acid amplification. The term \u201cstrand displacement type DNA polymerase\u201d means a DNA polymerase which, when a double-stranded region is present in the direction of extension during a process of synthesizing a DNA strand complementary to a template DNA, is capable of continuing complementary strand synthesis while dissociating the strand.

Furthermore, since the B2c region of the loop on the \u2018 end side is single-stranded, BIP can anneal thereto, and the DNA strand is extended by DNA synthesis starting from the 3\u2019 end of the B2 region while displacing the previously synthesized DNA strand from the B1 region.\n\nSTEP 9 (FIG. 2 (9)): Next, in the structure of FIG. 2 (8), the DNA strand as extended from the B1 region that has been brought to a single-stranded state by being peeled by the DNA strand that has been obtained by extended synthesis from BIP has a complementary region on the 3\u2032 end and, hence, forms a loop. From the 3\u2032 end of the F1 region of this loop, DNA synthesis starts using the single-stranded DNA itself as a template. Then, the resulting DNA strand is extended while displacing the DNA strand from the double-stranded BIP, thus producing a structure shown in FIG. 2 (9).\n\nSTEP 10 (FIG. 2 (10)): Through the above process, the DNA strand synthesized from BIP converts to a single strand, and having complementary regions, F1c and F1 as well as B1 and B1c, at opposite ends, it self-anneals to form a loop, producing a structure shown in FIG. 2 (10). The structure of FIG. 2 (10) is completely complementary to the structure of FIG. 2 (7).\n\nSTEP 11 (FIG. 2 (11)): In the structure of FIG. 2 (10), DNA synthesis is performed using itself as a template starting from the 3\u2032 end of the F1 region as in the case of STEP 7, and furthermore, FIP anneals to the single-stranded F2c region so that DNA synthesis is performed while displacing the DNA strand from F1 region. As a result, a structure shown in FIG. 2 (7) is produced again through the processes of STEPs 10 and 11 in the same manner as the processes of STEPs 7, 8 and 10.\n\nSTEP 12 (FIG. 2 (12)): In the structure of FIG. 2 (9) or FIG. 2 (12), FIP (or BIP) anneals to the single-stranded F2c (or B2c) region, thereby synthesizing a DNA strand while displacing the double-stranded portion. As a result of these processes, amplification products are produced in various sizes presenting structures in which complementary sequences are alternately repeated on the same strand.",

The loop primers are primers (Loop primer B and Loop primer F, respectively) each having a sequence complementary to a single-stranded portion of Loop on the 5\u2032 end side (between B1 region and B2 region, or F1 region and F2 region) among a dumbbell-like structure that is the starting structure for amplification reaction and a loop structure region to be formed in an amplification product. The use of the loop primers increases the number of the starting points for DNA synthesis, and makes it possible to shorten the time of amplification reaction and improve specificity. The loop primers can be designed by \u201cLAMP method primer design support software PrimerExplorer V5\u201d (Fujitsu \u201cNet Laboratory\u201d).",
                                "The LAMP method can amplify both DNA and RNA, has extremely high specificity and amplification efficiency, and can perform treatments starting from amplification until detection in a one-step process based on the presence or absence of the formation of the white precipitates of magnesium pyrophosphate as a reaction by-product or the presence or absence of fluorescent color development due to a chelating agent, calcein. In principle, the LAMP method is one of the nucleic acid amplification methods and thus is also capable of distributing a sample into microcompartments for limiting dilution and performing a LAMP reaction in the same manner as in the above digital PCR, and then quantifying a target nucleic acid by a statistical technique (digital LAMP). Further, when an amplification product (characterized by having a stem-loop structure) is synthesized with a target nucleic acid template from a primer that serves as a starting point, the amplification reaction proceeds continuously from the single-stranded loop region under isothermal conditions, and thus it is less susceptible to reaction inhibition due not only to an excess of nucleic acids but also to impurities. Further, in addition to the basic four different primers, a loop primer by which a starting point for the synthesis of a single-stranded loop region of an amplification product is utilized more efficiently may be added to thereby make it possible to increase the amplification efficiency and shorten the amplification reaction. In the present invention, attention is paid to RNA structures such as exons and introns of undifferentiation marker genes whose expression varies significantly in the process of directed differentiation, and thus primers and/or probes for detecting RNA structures that are more abundant in undifferentiated cells than in non-undifferentiated cells can be set.",
                                "The use of the LAMP method makes it possible to consecutively perform the reverse transcription of RNA to be detected, its amplification, and then detection of the same. Reverse transcription, amplification and detection can be performed consecutively in one tube. The temperatures for reverse transcription and amplification may be varied, or the temperatures may be unified (for example, 63\u00b0 C.) to carry out transcription and amplification.",
                                "In addition, unlike the PCR method in which the reaction solution volume needs be limited to a small value (5 \u03bcL to 100 \u03bcL) in order to quickly and accurately control the rise and fall of the reaction temperature in seconds, the LAMP method continuously performs amplification reaction at an isothermal temperature. Hence, in the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, particularly the LAMP method, sample liquid volume can be increased, and the total quantity of nucleic acids (weight) per test can be 0.5 \u03bcg or more. Moreover, the total quantity of nucleic acids (weight) per test can be 5 \u03bcg or more, preferably 10.0 \u03bcg or more, more preferably 50 \u03bcg or more, and most preferably 100.0 \u03bcg or more. For example, when the reaction solution volume is set to 5 \u03bcL to 100 \u03bcL per test as in the PCR method, the total quantity of nucleic acids (weight) is 0.5 \u03bcg or more and less than 5 \u03bcg. When the reaction solution volume is set to 100 \u03bcL to 1,000 \u03bcL, the total quantity of nucleic acids is 0.5 \u03bcg or more and less than 50 \u03bcg. When the reaction solution volume is set to range from 1 mL to 10 mL, the total quantity of nucleic acids is 0.5 \u03bcg or more and less than 100 \u03bcg. Moreover, when the reaction solution volume is set to 10 mL or more, the total quantity of nucleic acids is 100.0 \u03bcg or more. In this manner, the total quantity of nucleic acids can also be increased by increasing the reaction solution volume.",
                                "As described in the above section, when the total quantity of nucleic acids (weight) per test is increased, a large amount of nucleic acids other than target nucleic acids are brought into the sample in an increased amount and, at the same time, the sample-derived components (proteins, lipids, sugars, etc.) other than nucleic acids are also brought into the reaction in large quantities. The PCR method is known to be problematic in that the function of polymerase deteriorates due to the depletion of magnesium ions contributing to the structural stabilization of nucleic acid and that the formation of a single-stranded nucleic acid sample is delayed by heat denaturation, whereupon an excess amount of template nucleic acids inhibits the specific amplification reaction. On the other hand, the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, particularly the LAMP method, is performed under mild heating conditions (around 60\u00b0 C. to 65\u00b0 C.) without the need of single-strand formation by heat denaturation and, instead, primers specifically anneal to a plurality of single-stranded regions synthesized in the structure of an amplification product, and a new amplification reaction proceeds from those regions which serve as a starting point for synthesis. Therefore, the method is not easily affected by reaction inhibition due to an excess amount of nucleic acid samples, and is not easily affected by impurities other than nucleic acids. Utilizing these features, it is possible to directly use a sample extract with a low degree of purification for amplification reaction. For example, a culture solution containing a food of interest which is commercially available is used as a reagent for food/environmental test and it is denatured by heating under alkaline conditions, neutralized and simply centrifuged to obtain a supernatant, which can be directly applied as a nucleic acid sample.",
                                "Each primer to be used in the present invention has a chain length sufficient to perform binding by base-pairing with a complementary strand while maintaining required specificity under a given environment in various nucleic acid synthesis reactions that constitute the present invention. Specifically, the length of the primer ranges from 5 to 200 bases, and more desirably 10 to 50 base pairs. Since the chain length of a primer that is recognized by a known polymerase that catalyzes a sequence-dependent nucleic acid synthesis reaction is at least about 5 bases, the chain length of an annealing portion needs to be greater than that. In addition, in order to expect specificity as a nucleotide sequence, it is stochastically desirable to use a length of 10 or more bases. On the other hand, it is difficult to prepare an unduly long nucleotide sequence by chemical synthesis, so the above-mentioned chain length is given as an example of a length within a desirable range. Note that the chain length given here as an example is just the chain length of the portion that anneals to a complementary strand. Speaking of FIP, it is composed of at least two regions, F2 and F1c. Therefore, the chain length given here as an example should be understood as the chain length of each region that constitutes the primer.",

                                "Magnesium pyrophosphate is produced as a by-product in the process of nucleic acid amplification reaction. Since this by-product is produced in proportion to the amplified product, it is observed as white turbid in the LAMP method which yields a very large amount of amplified products. Therefore, the presence or absence of a target gene can be confirmed by the presence or absence of white turbid. Turbidity can be measured with a turbidity meter.",
                                "The thus amplified nucleic acid can also be detected using fluorescence. Typical fluorescence detection methods include a method using an intercalator and a method using a fluorescently labeled probe; either or both of these methods may be used and, alternatively, another detection method may be used. For the intercalator method, SYTO63, ethidium bromide, SYBR (registered trademark) Green, SYBR (registered trademark) Gold, Oxazole Yellow, Thiazole Orange, PicoGreen, GelGreen and the like can be used. There are many types of fluorescently labeled probes, as exemplified by Qprobe (registered trademark), TaqMan (registered trademark) probe, MolecularBeacon, cycling probe and the like. In many cases of using fluorescently labeled probes, a fluorescent substance is combined with a quencher for detection based on the FRET principle. A fluorescent substance absorbs light of a specific wavelength to become excited and emits light of a wavelength different from the wavelength of the absorbed light when it returns to the initial ground state. Quenchers receive light energy from fluorescent substances and emit it as light or thermal energy. Examples of fluorescent substances can include FITC, TMR, 6-joe, Bodipy (registered trademark)-FL/C6, Bodipy (registered trademark)-FL/C3, TAMRA, FAM, and HEX. Examples of quenchers can include BHQ (registered trademark)-1, and BHQ (registered trademark)-2. Qprobe is a quenching probe and requires no quencher. In Qprobe, fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when guanine is present in the vicinity of a base complementary to a base modified with a fluorescent dye upon hybridization, and the fluorescence is quenched. Examples of the fluorescent dye possessed by Qprobe include FITC, TMR, 6-joe, Bodipy (registered trademark)-FL/C6, and Bodipy (registered trademark)-FL/C3.",

                                "The LAMP method has such a feature that an extremely large amount of nucleic acids is synthesized and a large amount of pyrophosphate ions is also produced as a by-product. When a chelating agent, calcein, is used as a fluorescence visual detection reagent, calcein binds with manganese ions to quench fluorescence before amplification, but emits fluorescence as the LAMP reaction proceeds to generate pyrophosphate ions and deprive manganese ions. Furthermore, the pyrophosphate ions bind with magnesium ions in the reaction solution to emit enhanced fluorescence. According to this principle, the presence or absence of amplification by the LAMP reaction can be easily determined visually based on the presence or absence of fluorescent color development.",

Those two RT-LAMP methods targeted the same undifferentiation marker gene, LINC00678, and yet they exhibited higher sensitivities than when set 1 was used. This is due not only to optimization of reaction conditions including the designing of primers and a detection probe but also to the result of increasing the weight of nucleic acids in a sample per test to 5.0 \u03bcg. This indicates that even if the amount of contaminating nucleic acids increases, a small amount of a nucleic acid containing a specific sequence to be detected can be detected adequately. Furthermore, even those cells which had been differentiated from iPS cells but which exhibited different cell functions from HE cells (hepatic endoderm cells) and EC cells (vascular endothelial cells) could also be tested by RT-LAMP to allow for detection of a trace amount of spiked-in iPS cells in those differentiated cells."

The undifferentiation marker gene to be detected should be selected from those which exhibit such a quantitative change that their expression level decreases in the process of differentiation. It should be noted that a versatile marker gene should be selected without being limited to a particular undifferentiation marker gene as shown in the foregoing Examples using a number of genes. Further, the non-undifferentiated cells in which undifferentiated cells may potentially be present are not limited to those differentiated and/or derived from pluripotent stem cells (human ES cells, human iPS cells, etc.) and somatic stem cells and they may be cells isolated from somatic cells such as HEK293T cells and HeLa cells.",
                        "For detecting the presence or absence of undifferentiated cells in the present invention, it is preferable that nucleic acid samples derived from cell populations that may potentially contain undifferentiated cells are used in as large amounts as possible, so a method that is limited in the volume of a reaction solution and the amount of nucleic acids to be used is not preferable. In general, PCR is susceptible to reaction inhibition in the presence of an excess amount of nucleic acids, so in order to detect a trace amount of iPS cells in a sample by PCR, their percentage must be relatively high by all means. On the other hand, in the LAMP method, even when the final quantity of RNA is in an excess amount ranging from 1 \u03bcg to 10 \u03bcg, satisfactory amplification reactions occur and the detection sensitivity is high, so the LAMP method is suitable as a method for detecting residual undifferentiated cells. Further, the undifferentiation marker gene to be selected as a detection target in the present method is preferably a gene having not only high RNA expression level in undifferentiated cells but also low RNA expression level in differentiated cells. As mentioned above, in the present method, the marker gene is not limited to any particular type, and the non-undifferentiated cells which may potentially contain undifferentiated cells are also not limited to any specific types and, hence, the present method should be recognized as versatile.",
                        "Further, in the isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods to be used in the present invention, particularly in the LAMP method, detection sensitivity can be adjusted from 10 copies/test to several thousands of copies/test by varying the reaction composition conditions including the nucleotide sequences of primers to be used, the amounts of the primers, the concentrations of substrates, enzymes, catalysts therefor, and the like. In other words, detection sensitivity is variable depending on various conditions involved in the reaction. This characteristic allows the detection of presence, absence, or amount of undifferentiated cells by preparing multiple reaction composition conditions for providing different detection sensitivities and subjecting one sample to tests under such various reaction composition conditions. Note that multiple reaction composition conditions for providing different detection sensitivities are not limited in any detail and may be set for each reaction vessel (tube) or may be in such a form that tests can be performed simultaneously under multiple reaction conditions in a single device which yet has branched internal flow paths."
