                        "The present disclosure describes a system and method for implementing a protocol for coupling a qubit to a register. The protocol comprises a sequence of pulses synchronized with an RF field, the protocol further comprising a timing, a phase, and a duration of each of the pulses comprising a single qubit gate, a period and amplitude of the RF field, and a number of repeats of the sequence, wherein application of the protocol controls a coherent spin exchange interaction between a register and a qubit having a zero magnetic dipole moment. The qubit comprises a first spin state and a second spin state both of which have a zero magnetic dipole moment and the register comprises multiple register spins having an energy level structure. The register spins are indistinguishable so as to be configurable in basis states including a superposition state used for storing the quantum state of the qubit. The system further typically includes a source of the pulses comprising an electromagnetic field tuned to excite a transition between the first spin state and the second spin state.",
                        "The quantum memory can be implemented using nuclear spin-wave like states that can be implemented in a variety of (e.g., solid state) material systems. In typical examples, the quantum register is implemented using utilizing high spin, spectrally-indistinguishable, dense, lattice nuclear spins surrounding solid-state qubits. The control protocols induce coherent interaction between a central solid-state qubit and surrounding lattice ion nuclear spins. Specifically, the protocols are used to generate entangled states between the solid-state qubit and local nuclear ensemble and to implement a deterministic quantum register using the same ensemble. These features are vital ingredients for building large-scale multi-node quantum networks.",

Via a dynamically-engineered spin exchange interaction, this nuclear spin ensemble is polarized to generate collective spin excitations, and subsequently used to implement a long-lived quantum memory. Unlike conventional, disordered nuclear spin based quantum memories [16-24], the platform is deterministic and reproducible, ensuring identical quantum registers for all 171Yb3+ qubits. The approach provides a framework for utilising the complex structure of dense nuclear spin baths, paving the way for building large-scale quantum networks using single rare-earth ion qubits [15,25-28].",
                                "The hyperfine levels of single 171Yb3+ ions doped into yttrium orthovanadate (YVO4), coupled to nanophotonic cavities, form high-quality optically addressable qubits [15]. The surrounding 51V5+ lattice ion nuclear spins generate a noisy magnetic field environment due to their large magnetic moment and high spin (I=7/2). Coherent 171Yb qubit operation is enabled by magnetically-insensitive transitions, leading to long coherence times (16 ms) and high gate fidelities (0.99975) (FIG. 6). Whilst decoupling from sources of magnetic noise achieves an excellent operating regime for the 171Yb qubit, the 51V nuclear spins also provide a readily accessible, local resource for quantum information storage due to their inherently weak interactions with the environment. To date, most research regarding host nuclear spin utilisation has focused on several spectrally distinguishable impurity nuclear spins coupled to a localised electronic spin, e.g. 13C coupled to colour centres in diamond or 29Si coupled to defects in silicon carbide, rare-earth ions, quantum dots or donor qubits in silicon [10,16-24]. Recently, a regime consisting of a large number of indistinguishable nuclear spins coupled to the delocalised electronic spin in a quantum dot has also been explored [29,30]. In contrast, the system described herein addresses a new regime where a small, deterministic cluster of spectrally indistinguishable nuclear spins are coupled to a single localized electronic spin. Specifically, the 171Yb electronic wavefunction is confined to the lattice site, and the YVO4 crystal consists of highly isotopically pure, 99.8% 51V, nuclear spins. This confined, dense nuclear spin ensemble could be used as a deterministic local quantum processor by creating and manipulating entangled states, such as collective spin wave-like excitations, for near-term quantum applications. Critically, interfacing with these nuclear spins whilst preserving high qubit coherence necessitates the development of novel quantum control protocols using magnetically insensitive transitions that are robust against environmental noise.",
                                "At zero-magnetic field the 171Yb ground state contains a pair of levels |0g and |1g, separated by 675 MHz, which form our qubit [31] (FIG. 1b). The |1g population is optically read out via a series of \u03c0 pulses at 984 nm, each followed by time-resolved detection of resonant photon emission (FIG. 5). This is enabled by coupling the 171Yb ion to a nanophotonic cavity leading to high transition cyclicity, reduced optical lifetime and high photon collection efficiency [15]. The local crystalline environment consists of 89Y, 51V and 16O ions. Of these, 51V with nuclear spin 7/2 has the largest magnetic dipole moment and zero-field structure due to a quadrupole interaction with the lattice electric field [32]. This leads to four quadratically-spaced, doubly degenerate energy levels, {|\u00b1m1}={|\u00b11/2, |\u00b15/2, |\u00b15/2, |\u00b17/2}, and three magnetic-dipole allowed transitions between these levels \u03c9a,\u03c9b,\u03c9c (FIG. 1b).",
                                "Local 51V ions are categorised into two complementary ensembles: the register and the bath. The register spins fulfil two conditions: (1) they are constituents of the frozen core: a set of 51V ions spectrally distinguished from the bath due to proximity to 171Yb; (2) the 171Yb51V interaction Hamiltonian can drive transitions between their quadrupole levels. As shown later, experimental evidence suggests that the register consists of four 51V spins, equidistant from the central 171Yb. At zero field, the 171Yb|0g, |1g states have no magnetic dipole moment and thus interactions with 51V register spins are forbidden to first order. However, a weak 171Yb dipole moment is induced by a random magnetic field originating from the bath (the nuclear Overhauser field, with z component B\u03c0OH), giving rise to an effective 171Yb-51V register interaction. Specifically, a second-order pertur-bation analysis yields the following Hamiltonian:",

Note that BzOH varies randomly in time as the bath changes state in a stochastic fashion, rendering this interaction Hamiltonian unreliable for register quantum state manipulation and requiring an alternative approach. To this end, we develop a protocol to generate a deterministic 171Yb-51V interaction via Hamiltonian engineering, which will be elaborated later.",
                                "An additional challenge is presented by the spectral indistinguishability of the register spins, necessitating storage in collective states. As originally proposed for quantum dots [14], single spin excitations of a polarised nuclear spin ensemble can be used for quantum information storage. These states are often termed spin waves or nuclear magnons and are generated by spin-preserving exchange dynamics. Preparing these collective nuclear spin states relies firstly on initialising the thermal register ensemble into a pure state, |0v=|\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193, where {|\u2191, |\u2193}={|\u00b15/2, |\u00b17/2} is a two-level sub-manifold of the nuclear spin-7/2 51V ion (FIG. 1c, d). Next, with access to exchange dynamics and 171Yb initialised |1a, we can transfer a single excitation from the 171Yb to the register. It is noted that the excitation is delocalised equally across the four register spins due to coupling homogeneity as determined by the lattice geometry, thus naturally realising the entangled four-body W-state |Wv [33] given by",

                                "(FIG. 1C). If the 171Yb qubit is initialised into |0g there are no spin excitations in the system and the 51V register remains in |0v. Crucially, these dynamics realise a quantum swap gate between a target state prepared by the 171Yb qubit, |\u03c8=\u03b1|0g+\u03b2|1g, and the |0v state of the 51V register, leading to",

Established pulse-based methods used to generate such interactions, e.g. Hartmann Hahn [34] and PulsePol [35], do not suit the requirements of the present application as they are susceptible to random noise from the bath (FIG. 7). To this end, the present invention uses a framework for robust dynamic Hamiltonian engineering [36] to design a new sequence tailored for qubits with no intrinsic magnetic moment (subsequently referred to as ZenPol for \u2018zero first order Zeeman nuclear-spin polarisation\u2019). ZenPol comprises equidistant \u03c0/2 and \u03c0 pulses combined with a synchronous, z-directed, square-wave RF magnetic field with tuneable amplitude, BRF, and period 2\u03c4 (FIG. 2a). The sequence is repeated M times leading to a total interrogation duration of tM=2\u03c4M. The RF field induces an alternating 171Yb magnetic dipole moment, thereby generating a similar 171Yb-51V interaction as B\u03c0OH in equation (1) but in a controlled manner. The sequence is synchronised with the 51V precession at one of the nuclear spin transition frequencies, \u03c9i, by satisfying",

At this resonance condition the leading-order dynamics are understood by considering the temporal interference between time-varying 171Yb spin operators and 51V precession in the interaction picture (Methods). The ZenPol sequence is designed such that RF-induced spin-preserving dynamics interfere constructively, while all other dynamics, including the bath-induced incoherent interactions, undergo destructive interference. As a result, the 171Yb-51V interaction is governed by the following timeaveraged effective Hamiltonian",

While the nuclear spin can stochastically occupy either the {|+mI} or {|\u2212mI} manifold of states, the protocol described herein is insensitive to this sign. Moreover, this pulse sequence operates at zero magnetic field where a long 171Yb coherence time can be maintained; it is insensitive to the presence of random noise from the bath; and is also robust to experimental imperfections, e.g. pulse rotation errors."

The presence of two nuclear spin ensembles is postulated: a distant large ensemble with unperturbed frequency (constituents of the bath) and a local small ensemble with a frequency shift due to crystalline strain in the vicinity of the 171Yb ion (the register).",
                                "Polarisation of the entire nuclear spin register relies on repeated application of the ZenPol sequence, resonant with a targeted transition, interleaved with reinitialisation of the 171Yb qubit leading to unidirectional transfer of 51V population. (FIG. 5c). Since a the spin-7/2 51V ions have four energy levels, high fidelity initialisation by independently polarising different transitions is achieved with different values of \u03c4. For example, to prepare the register spins in |\u00b17/2=|\u2193, a pair of ZenPol sequences is repeatedly applied which first polarise into |\u00b15/2 using the \u03c9b transition, and then subsequently into \u00b1|7/2 using the \u03c9c transition (FIG. 9). The data confirms that both \u03c9b and \u03c9c transitions of the 51V register are successfully polarised as indicated by the near-complete disappearance of the initial resonances (insets, FIG. 2b). Note that the resonances at 685 kHz and 1028 kHz are unaffected, corroborating the existence of two distinct 51V ensembles discussed above. The \u03c9a transition is not directly addressed by the ZenPol sequence due to spectral overlap with other resonances, however, this does not limit our polarisation fidelity, estimated to be \u224884%, as discussed in Supplementary Examples.",

Furthermore, a can be accurately controlled by var in BRF, allowing for fidelity optimisation of the swap gate (inset, FIG. 2c). By contrast, with 171Yb initialised in |0g, exchange interactions are forbidden and thus oscillations are suppressed (blue, FIG. 2c).",

This is verified by controlling the number of spins in the \u03c9c transition manifold and measuring the effect on Jex. This is implemented by first emptying the \u03c9c manifold via the application of downward-polarising ZenPol sequences, thereby pumping all four spins to |\u00b13/2 and |\u00b11/2. Subsequently, a single excitation is performed on the \u03c9b transition to flip one spin from |\u00b13/2 to |\u2191(=|\u00b15/2), leading to N=1 spins in the \u03c9c manifold. Applying a ZenPol sequence resonant with the \u03c9c transition, it is found that the resulting exchange frequency is reduced by a factor of \u2248\u221a{square root over (4)} (FIG. 2d); according to the YVO4 lattice structure, the register likely consists of the second-nearest shell of four equidistant 51V ions (Supplementary Examples). This assumption is supported by close agreement between experiment and numerical simulation in all cases (FIG. 10)."

As shown in FIG. 3a, there is a sinusoidal oscillation of the 171Yb population, modulated by a Gaussian coherence decay, whose contrast vanishes with a 1/e time of T2*=58\u00b14 \u03bcs. This oscillation has a frequency of \u03c9c/2\u03c0=991 kHz, originating from relative phase accumulation between |0v and |Wv during the wait time. The coherence time of the 51V register is predominantly limited by local magnetic field noise from two sources: a fluctuating 171Yb dipole moment (171Yb Knight field) and the nuclear Overhauser field (Supplementary Information). As shown in FIG. 3b, the noise created by 171Yb can be effectively decoupled from the register by periodically flipping the 171Yb magnetic dipole orientation via a series of \u03c0 pulses. Similar to the motional narrowing effect [37], the neutralization of the dipole moment arrests undesired phase diffusion of the register, leading to an increased 1/e coherence time of T2*=225\u00b19 \u03bcs. The coherence time can be further extended by performing dynamical decoupling on the 51V register to mitigate the decoherence effect of the nuclear spin bath. This relies on applying 51V\u03c0 pulses resonant with the \u03c9c transition whilst leaving the bath unperturbed (FIG. 11). In FIG. 3c, we apply two 51V\u03c0 pulses with variable inter-pulse delay, combined with periodic pulses applied to the 171Yb qubit, significantly extending the the 1/e coherence time to T2=760\u00b11.4 \u03bcs.",

Subsequently, the |1g state is also emptied by applying an optical \u03c0 pulse to the A transition followed by a microwave \u03c0 pulse to the fg transition in rapid succession, which similarly leads to excitation from |1g to |1e and decay into |0g. This process is repeated several times for improved fidelity.",

Specifically, periodic pulsed control can dynamically engineer the original Hamiltonian (equation (7)) to realize effective spin-exchange interaction between 151Yb and 51V ions of the form, {tilde over (\u015c)}+\u00ce\u2212+{tilde over (\u015c)}\u2212\u00ce+, in the average Hamiltonian picture [36],[44] One example of such a protocol is the recently developed PulsePol sequence [35], however, it relies on states with a constant, nonzero magnetic dipole moment and therefore cannot be used in our system since the 171Yb qubit has no intrinsic magnetic dipole moment. Motivated by this approach, we have developed a variant of the PulsePol sequence that accompanies a square-wave RF field synchronized with the sequence (FIG. 8a). The base sequence has a total of 8 free-evolution intervals with equal duration (\u03c4/4) defined by periodically spaced short pulses and is repeatedly applied to 171Yb. Following the sequence design framework presented in Ref. [36], we judiciously choose the phase and ordering of the constituent \u03c0/2 and \u03c0 pulses such that the resulting effective interaction has spin-exchange form with strength proportional to the RF magnetic field amplitude (BRF), whilst decoupling from interactions induced by the Overhauser field (B\u03c0OH). The sequence was designed to cancel detuning induced by both of these fields and to retain robustness against pulse rotation errors to leading order.

Firstly we initialise the 171Yb qubit into |0g and apply a sinusoidal z-directed RF magnetic field at \u03c9c/2\u03c0=991 kHz through the coplanar waveguide to induce an oscillating 171Yb magnetic dipole moment (FIG. 11a) This generates an x-directed field component at each 51V spin, where the driving Hamiltonian is given by \u0124drive=\u03bcNqvxAxB\u03c0osc sin(\u03c9ct)\u0128x with Ax=3 ln \u03bc0\u03b3z2/8\u03c0r3\u03c901.

Crucially, the amplification factor scales as Ax\u221d1/r3 with distance r from the 171Yb qubit, leading to a reduced driving strength for distant 51V bath spins. Moreover, the transition frequency of the bath, \u03c9cbath/2\u03c0=1028 kHz, is detuned by 37 kHz from that of the register, \u03c9c/2\u03c0=991 kHz, further weakening the bath interaction due to off-resonant driving provided that the Rabi frequency is less than the detuning.",

To calibrate 51V \u03c0 pulse times, we initialise the register into |0v=|\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193, drive the register for variable time, and read out the |0v population by preparing the 171Yb qubit in |1g and applying a swap gate to the \u03c9c transition. If the final 51V spin state is in |\u2193(|\u2191) the swap will be successful (unsuccessful) and the 171Yb qubit will end up in |0g(|1g). Using this method, we induce resonant Rabi oscillations of the register at a Rabi frequency of 2\u03c0\u00d7(7.65\u00b10.05) kHz (blue markers, FIG. 11c) which exhibit exponential decay on a 280\u00b130 \u03bcs timescale, limited by dephasing caused by the fluctuating 171Yb Knight field. This can be decoupled using motional narrowing techniques whereby we periodically apply \u03c0 pulses to the 171Yb every 6 \u03bcs during the drive period. In order to drive the 51V spins in a phase-continuous manner, we compensate for the inversion of the 171Yb magnetic dipole moment after each \u03c0 pulse by applying a \u03c0 phase shift to the sinusoidal driving field (FIG. 11b). This leads to an extended 1/e Gaussian decay time of 1040\u00b170 \u03bcs (red markers, FIG. 11c). The arrow in FIG. 11c indicates the 69 \u03bcs 51V\u03c0 pulse time used for dynamical decoupling.

This is achieved using two separate sequences: Readout sequence 1 and Readout sequence 2, applied alternately, which measure the {|0g0v, |0gWv} and {|1g0v, |1gWv} populations respectively. As shown in FIG. 13a, these sequences are distinguished by the presence (absence) of a single \u03c0 pulse applied to the 171Yb qubit at the start of the sequence. This is followed by a single optical readout cycle on the A transition; results are post-selected on detection of a single optical photon during this period. Hence the presence (absence) of the first \u03c0 pulse results in |0g(|1g) state readout after post selection. Furthermore, in all post-selected cases the 171Yb qubit is initialised to |1g by taking into account this conditional measurement outcome. Subsequently, an unconditional \u03c0 pulse is applied to the 171Yb, preparing it in |0g and a swap gate is applied, thereby transferring the 51V state to the 171Yb.

Assuming the swap and swapback processes are symmetric, a gate fidelity sw=\u221a{square root over ((1\u22122ppost)/(1\u22122ppre))} is obtained.

We use the same value of BRF=1.6G as in FIG. 2c, and optimise the polarisation level leading to 1\u2212\u03f5=0.8.

This method enables spin exchange between two systems with different transition frequencies by resonantly driving a qubit with a Rabi frequency that matches the energy level splitting of the environmental nuclear spins. In our case, we resonantly drive the 171Yb at 675 MHz to generate a pair of dressed states",

The 171Yb qubit is initialised into the |\u2212 dressed state by a \u03c0/2 pulse preceding the driving period. If resonant with a nuclear spin transition, the 171Yb qubit undergoes spin exchange at a rate dictated by the interaction strength. Finally we read out the 171Yb|+ dressed state population to determine whether spin exchange has occurred. FIG. 7b shows experimental results of Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy where we vary both the HH drive Rabi frequency (\u03a9) and also the HH pulse duration (t). The counts plotted on the colour-bar are proportional to the |+ dressed state population. Three clear resonances are found at evenly spaced pulse amplitudes 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45 corresponding to the \u03c9a, \u03c9b and \u03c9c 51V transitions; notably, unlike ZenPol, the HH sequence only has one harmonic leading to a single resonant interaction per transition. Also note the lack of oscillations when varying the pulse duration, t, on resonance with either of the three transitions: this is because the spin exchange is driven by the randomised, Overhauser field induced 171Yb dipole moment. For this reason, the HH sequence cannot be used to generate the coherent exchange interaction necessary to realise a swap gate for our system. In the case of no driving (\u03a9=0), the signal rapidly saturates as t increases as a result of Ramsey dephasing of the initial state. However, as \u03a9 exceeds the 171Yb spin linewidth (\u02dc50 kHz[8]), this effect diminishes due to the emergence of spin-locking effects and consequently leads to an increased saturation timescale when not resonant with the 51V transitions. The resolution of this measurement is also limited by the 171Yb spin linewidth, and we therefore cannot resolve the split-resonance structure observed in the ZenPol spectra. The results agree well with simulations (FIG. 7c) verifying that interactions with the 51V quadrupolar structure dominate these measurements.",

                                "Polarisation dynamics are explored using the PROPI method (polarisation readout by polarisation inversion) [11]. This sequence uses the back-action of the 51V spins on the 171Yb to measure the register polarisation after successive ZenPol polarisation cycles. For instance, when polarising into |\u2191=|\u00b15/2 on the \u03c9c transition, the 171Yb is initialised into |1g and undergoes spin exchange with any 51V population in |\u2193=|\u00b17/2. The 171Yb|0g population after interaction is therefore related to the residual 51V|\u2193 population. As presented in FIG. 9a, the 171Yb population is measured after each of 20 consecutive polarisation cycles and a saturation is observed after 10 cycles, indicating that the 171Yb polarisation has been transferred to the 51V register. The high-contrast signal obtained in this measurement is enabled by alternating the 51V polarisation direction, i.e. periods of polarisation into |\u2191 are interleaved with periods of polarisation into |\u2193. This mitigates the need to wait for slow register thermalisation (T1(0)\u22480.5 s, see Supplementary Information Section X) between consecutive experiment repetitions. These measurements are repeated with ZenPol sequences on the \u03c9b transition, demonstrating similar levels of polarisation saturation after approximately 10 cycles (FIG. 9b).",

As expected, the coherent spin-exchange oscillations emerge as an increasing number of polarisation cycles are applied.",

Based on simulations discussed in Supplementary Information, we estimate this protocol achieves \u224884% polarisation into the |0v state. Note the ZenPol sequence is not used to directly polarise the \u03c9a transition due to spectral overlap with \u03c9b and \u03c9c (FIG. 2b). We postulate that the high degree of polarisation can still be achieved even in the absence of direct \u03c9a transition control due to two factors:",

For instance, direct microwave driving of the register \u03c9c-transition would lead to Rabi oscillation between |0v\u2032 and |1v\u2032 and could therefore be used to realise local gates in this basis. Additionally, a second spin excitation is not allowed in this scheme, therefore the ZenPol sequence reproduces a complete two-qubit swap gate regardless of the 171Yb state.

In particular, when reading out this coherence, we apply a \u221a{square root over (swap)} gate which maps |\u03a8+=\u00bd(|1g0v\u2212i|0gWv) to |0gWv and |\u03a8\u2212=\u00bd(|1g0v+i|0gWv) to |1g0v. Note that reading out the 171Yb state is sufficient to distinguish the |\u03a8+ and |\u03a8\u2212 states in this measurement. We can account for the readout fidelity of the |\u03a8\u00b1 states by using a \u221a{square root over (,1)} factor (Methods), i.e. if the state |\u03a8+(|\u03a8\u2212 ) is perfectly prepared, 171Yb will be measured in state |0g(|1g) with probability \u00bd(1+\u221a{square root over (,1)}). To span the 171Yb-51V Hilbert space, we also need to consider the effect of the readout \u221a{square root over (swap)} gate when the system is initialised into the other two states: |1gWv or |0g0v. To this end, we assign imperfect readout probabilities of q11 and q00 for |1gWv and |0g0v, respectively.

The contrast Cparity of the parity oscillation between |105 + and |\u03a8\u2212 is extracted by measuring the difference in the 171Yb|1g populations measured at t=0 and t=\u03c0/\u03c9c, allowing us to estimate the Bell state coherence as |\u03c101|=Cparity/2\u221a{square root over (,1)}. This implies that uncorrected and corrected Bell state coherence values differ by a factor of \u221a{square root over (,1)}=0.72.
