    "abstract": "Solid-state nuclear spins surrounding individual, optically addressable qubits1,2 are a crucial resource for quantum networks3-6, computation7-11 and simulation12. Although hosts with sparse nuclear spin baths are typically chosen to mitigate qubit decoherence13, developing coherent quantum systems in nuclear-spin-rich hosts enables exploration of a much broader range of materials for quantum information applications. The collective modes of these dense nuclear spin ensembles provide a natural basis for quantum storage14; however, using them as a resource for single-spin qubits has thus far remained elusive. Here, by using a highly coherent, optically addressed 171Yb3+ qubit doped into a nuclear-spin-rich yttrium orthovanadate crystal15, we develop a robust quantum control protocol to manipulate the multi-level nuclear spin states of neighbouring 51V5+ lattice ions. Via a dynamically engineered spin-exchange interaction, we polarize this nuclear spin ensemble, generate collective spin excitations, and subsequently use them to implement a quantum memory. We additionally demonstrate preparation and measurement of maximally entangled 171Yb-51V Bell states. Unlike conventional, disordered nuclear-spin-based quantum memories16-24, our platform is deterministic and reproducible, ensuring identical quantum registers for all 171Yb3+ qubits. Our approach provides a framework for utilizing the complex structure of dense nuclear spin baths, paving the way towards building large-scale quantum networks using single rare-earth ion qubits15,25-28.",

Nanophotonic cavities were fabricated from this material using focused ion beam milling, see [41,42] for more detail on this process. The cavity used in this work has a Qfactor of \u2248 10, 000 leading to Purcell enhancement and consequent reduction of the 171 Yb excited state lifetime from 267 \u00b5s to 2.3 \u00b5s as described and measured in [15] and > 99% of ion emission coupling to the cavity mode. The reduced optical lifetime enables detection of single 171 Yb ions. The cavity is undercoupled with \u03ba in /\u03ba \u2248 0.14 leading to 14% of emitted light entering the waveguide mode. Waveguide-free-space coupling is achieved via angled couplers with an efficiency of \u2248 25% and the end-toend system efficiency (probability of detecting an emitted photon) is \u2248 1%.",

The device is tuned on-resonance with the 171 Yb optical transitions via nitrogen condensation. Residual magnetic fields are cancelled along the crystal c \u2261 z axis with a set of home-built superconducting magnet coils.",
                "The various optical transitions of a single 171 Yb qubit are employed for state readout and initialisation (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Optical addressing of the A transition for readout is established with a continuous-wave (CW) titanium sapphire (Ti:Sapph) laser (M 2 Solstis) which is frequency-stabilised to a high-finesse reference cavity (Stable Laser Systems) using Pound-Drever-Hall locking [43]. The laser double-passes through two freespace acousto-optic-modulator (AOM) setups leading to single-photon level extinction of the input beam, and pulse generation with \u2248 10 ns rise times. A second CW external cavity diode laser (Toptica DL-Pro) is used to address the F transition during initialisation. The laser passes through an identical AOM setup and is frequency stabilised via offset-frequency locking to the Ti:Sapph.",
                "The light output from the cavity is separated from the input with a 99:1 fibre beamsplitter, and passed through a single AOM which provides time-resolved gating of the light to prevent reflected laser pulses from saturating the detector. The light is then sent to a tungsten-silicide superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) (Photonspot) which also sits on the still-plate of the cryostat. Photon detection events are subsequently timetagged and histogrammed (Swabian Timetagger 20).",

A second microwave path is used for the excited state microwave control (3.4 GHz) necessary for qubit initialisation. The control pulses are generated by switching the output of a signal generator (SRS SG386) and amplifying (Minicircuits ZHL-16W-43-S+). The two microwave signal paths are combined with a diplexer (Marki DPXN2) and sent into the fridge to the device. A gold coplanar waveguide fabricated on the YVO 4 surface enables microwave driving of the ions.",

All experiments start by initialising the single 171 Yb ion into |0 g via a two-stage protocol [15]. Firstly the |aux g state is emptied with a series of 3 \u00b5s pulses applied to the optical F transition each followed by a 3 \u00b5s wait period. When the 171 Yb ion is successfully excited from |aux g to |1 e , the population in |1 e will preferentially decay to |0 g during the wait time via the cavity-enhanced E transition. Subsequently, the |1 g state is also emptied by applying an optical \u03c0 pulse to the A transition followed by a microwave \u03c0 pulse to the f e transition in rapid succession, which similarly leads to excitation from |1 g to |1 e and decay into |0 g . This process is repeated several times for improved fidelity.",
                "Readout of the 171 Yb |1 g state is performed by applying a series of 100 \u03c0 pulses to the A transition, each of which is followed by a 10 \u00b5s photon detection window. This process is enabled by the cyclic nature of the A transition. To read out the |0 g population we apply an additional \u03c0 pulse to swap the |0 g \u2194 |1 g populations before performing the same optical readout procedure.",
                "Extended Data Fig. 1c shows an exemplary pulse sequence used to store and retrieve a superposition state from the register consisting of four 51 V lattice ions. The sequence starts with initialisation of the 171 Yb qubit into |0 g and the spin-7/2 51 V register into |0 v = |\u00b17/2 \u22974 . A series of ZenPol polarisation operations are interleaved with 171 Yb re-initialisation sequences and alternate between \u03c9 b and \u03c9 c transition control to sequentially polarize the 51 V register towards the |\u00b17/2 level. After the initialization sequence, a single \u03c0/2 pulse is applied to the 171 Yb qubit to prepare a superposition state. Subsequently, the state is transferred to the 51 V register using a swap operation resonant with the \u03c9 c transition as detailed in the main text. After a variable wait time, the superposition state is retrieved with a second swap gate and measured in the x-basis via a \u03c0/2 pulse followed by optical readout on the A transition as detailed above."

See Supplementary Information for a detailed derivation of this effective Hamiltonian.",
                "As discussed in the main text, polarisation of the 51 V register and preparation of collective spin-wave states relies on induced polarisation transfer from the 171 Yb to 51 V and is achieved via periodic driving of the 171 Yb qubit. Specifically, periodic pulsed control can dynamically engineer the original Hamiltonian (equation ( 7)) to realize effective spin-exchange interaction between 171 Yb and 51 V ions of the form, \u015c+ \u00ce-+ \u015c-\u00ce+ , in the average Hamiltonian picture [36], [44]. One example of such a protocol is the recently developed PulsePol sequence [35], however, it relies on states with a constant, nonzero magnetic dipole moment and therefore cannot be used in our system since the 171 Yb qubit has no intrinsic magnetic dipole moment. Motivated by this approach, we have developed a variant of the PulsePol sequence that accompanies a square-wave RF field synchronized with the sequence (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The base sequence has a total of 8 free-evolution intervals with equal duration (\u03c4 /4) defined by periodically spaced short pulses and is repeatedly applied to 171 Yb. Following the sequence design framework presented in Ref. [36], we judiciously choose the phase and ordering of the constituent \u03c0/2 and \u03c0 pulses such that the resulting effective interaction has spin-exchange form with strength proportional to the RF magnetic field amplitude (B RF ), whilst decoupling from interactions induced by the Overhauser field (B OH z ). We also design the sequence to cancel detuning induced by both of these fields and to retain robustness against pulse rotation errors to leading order. We term this new sequence 'ZenPol' for 'zero first-order Zeeman nuclear-spin polarisation'.",
                "To understand how the ZenPol sequence works, one can consider a toggling-frame transformation of the 171 Yb spin operator along the quantisation axis ( \u015cz,tog (t)): we keep track of how this operator is transformed after each preceding pulse. For example, the first \u03c0/2 pulse around the y-axis transforms \u015cz into -\u015cx and the subsequent \u03c0 pulse around the y-axis transforms -\u015cx into + \u015cx . Over one sequence period, the togglingframe transformation generates a time-dependent Hamiltonian \u0124tog (t) that is piecewise constant for each of 8 free-evolution intervals, which can be expressed as",
                "Here, f OH x,y (t) describes the time-dependent modulation of the 171 Yb qubit operator along the z axis ( \u015cz,tog (t) = f OH x (t) \u015cx + f OH y (t) \u015cy ) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Note that f OH z (t) = 0 for all intervals. Since the externallyapplied square-wave RF field is constant for each halfsequence period, we can replace B RF (t) with the amplitude B RF and transfer the time dependence to f OH x,y by applying sign flips, thus leading to redefined modulation functions f RF",

Thus, the leading-order average Hamiltonian, \u0124avg = 1 2\u03c4 2\u03c4 0 dt \u0124tog (t), in the rotating frame is given by:",
                "Here, various terms are excluded as they time average to zero (rotating-wave approximation). The \u221a 7 prefactor comes from mapping the original spin-7/2 operators to the effective spin-1/2 ones. Additionally, the energy shift induced by B OH z and time-dependent B RF is cancelled since we are using square-wave RF. The Fourier transforms of the modulation functions f x,y (t), termed the filter functions [45], directly reveal resonance frequencies at which equation ( 9) yields non-zero contributions (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Resonant interactions with strength proportional to the nuclear Overhauser field are achieved at sequence periods 2\u03c4 which satisfy 1 2\u03c4 = \u03c9c 2\u03c0\u00d72 , \u03c9c 2\u03c0\u00d74 , \u03c9c 2\u03c0\u00d76 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ; interactions proportional to the RF field occur at sequence periods satisfy-",
                "Critically, these two sets of resonances occur at different values of 2\u03c4 , hence we can preferentially utilise the coherent, RF-induced interactions whilst decoupling from those induced by the randomised Overhauser field. This is experimentally demonstrated in Fig. 2b where the RF-induced resonances are spectrally resolved. In this measurement the linewidth of the register resonances are limited by that of the filter function. We also note that the \u03c9 a transition cannot be independently addressed by the ZenPol sequence due to the multiplicity of the three 51 V transitions determined by the quadratic Hamiltonian (\u03c9 a = \u03c9 b /2 = \u03c9 c /3).",

We define the coefficient b (k,\u03c9j ) which determines the interaction strength for the k th resonance addressing transition \u03c9 j (for example, b (5,\u03c9c) = -\u221a 7( \u221a 2 + 2)a x /10\u03c0). In the main text, we omit the primes on the 171 Yb qubit operators for the sake of notational simplicity. The same analysis can be performed for other transitions, yielding a similar spinexchange Hamiltonian, albeit with different interaction strength.",
                "Direct Drive Gates for 51 V Register Performing dynamical decoupling on the register requires selective driving of the froze-core 51 V nuclear spins without perturbing the bath and is achieved through a two-fold mechanism. Firstly we initialise the 171 Yb qubit into |0 g and apply a sinusoidal z-directed RF magnetic field at \u03c9 c /2\u03c0 = 991 kHz through the coplanar waveguide to induce an oscillating 171 Yb magnetic dipole moment (Extended Data Fig. 7a). This generates an x-directed field component at each 51 V spin, where the driving Hamiltonian is given by \u0124drive = \u00b5 N g vx A x B osc z sin(\u03c9 c t) \u00cex with A x = -3ln\u00b5 0 \u03b3 2 z /8\u03c0r 3 \u03c9 01 . Here, \u00b5 N is the nuclear magneton, g vx is the 51 V xdirected g-factor, B osc z is the sinusoidal RF magnetic field amplitude, \u00cex is the nuclear spin-7/2 operator along the x-axis, {l, n} are the {x, z} directional cosines of the 171 Yb-51 V displacement vector, \u00b5 0 is the vacuum permittivity, and r is the 171 Yb-51 V ion distance (Supplementary Information). The lattice symmetry of the host leads to equidistant spacing of the four proximal 51 V spins from the central 171 Yb qubit allowing homogeneous coherent driving of all register spins.",
                "In this direct driving scheme, we note that the effect of B osc z is amplified by a factor of A x \u2248 6.7 for the frozencore register spins at a distance of r = 3.9 \u00c5 (Supplementary Information). Crucially, the amplification factor scales as A x \u221d 1/r 3 with distance r from the 171 Yb qubit, leading to a reduced driving strength for distant 51 V bath spins. Moreover, the transition frequency of the bath, \u03c9 bath c /2\u03c0 = 1028 kHz, is detuned by 37 kHz from that of the register, \u03c9 c /2\u03c0 = 991 kHz, further weakening the bath interaction due to off-resonant driving provided that the Rabi frequency is less than the detuning.",
                "In a rotating frame at frequency \u03c9 c , the driving Hamiltonian \u0124drive gives rise to Rabi oscillation dynamics of the register spins within the \u03c9 c manifold, {|\u2191 = |\u00b15/2 , |\u2193 = |\u00b17/2 }. To calibrate 51 V \u03c0 pulse times, we initialise the register into |0 v = |\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193 , drive the register for variable time, and read out the |0 v population by preparing the 171 Yb qubit in |1 g and applying a swap gate to the \u03c9 c transition. If the final 51 V spin state is in |\u2193 (|\u2191 ) the swap will be successful (unsuccessful) and the 171 Yb qubit will end up in |0 g (|1 g ). Using this method, we induce resonant Rabi oscillations of the register at a Rabi frequency of 2\u03c0 \u00d7 (7.65 \u00b1 0.05) kHz (blue markers, Extended Data Fig. 7c) which exhibit exponential decay on a 280 \u00b1 30 \u00b5s timescale, limited by dephasing caused by the fluctuating 171 Yb Knight field. This can be decoupled using motional narrowing techniques whereby we periodically apply \u03c0 pulses to the 171 Yb every 6 \u00b5s during the drive period. In order to drive the 51 V spins in a phase-continuous manner, we compensate for the inversion of the 171 Yb magnetic dipole moment after each \u03c0 pulse by applying a \u03c0 phase shift to the sinusoidal driving field (Extended Data Fig. 7b). This leads to an extended 1/e Gaussian decay time of 1040 \u00b1 70 \u00b5s (red markers, Extended Data Fig. 7c).",

In contrast to the spin-preserving exchange interaction, this direct drive protocol provides independent, local control of the four 171 V spins with no constraints on the number of excitations, thereby coupling the 51 V register to states outside the two-level manifold spanned by |0 v and |W v . For example, at odd multiple \u03c0 times, we find",
                "both of which contain more than a single excitation. For this reason, we use an even number of 51 V \u03c0 pulses in our decoupling sequences to always return the 51 V register to the memory manifold prior to state retrieval."

As shown in Extended Data Fig. 9a, these sequences are distinguished by the presence (absence) of a single \u03c0 pulse applied to the 171 Yb qubit at the start of the sequence. This is followed by a single optical readout cycle on the A transition; results are post-selected on detection of a single optical photon during this period. Hence the presence (absence) of the first \u03c0 pulse results in |0 g (|1 g ) state readout after post selection. Furthermore, in all post-selected cases the 171 Yb qubit is initialised to |1 g by taking into account this conditional measurement outcome. Subsequently, an unconditional \u03c0 pulse is applied to the 171 Yb, preparing it in |0 g and a swap gate is applied, thereby transferring the 51 V state to the 171 Yb. Finally, we perform single-shot readout of the 171 Yb state according to the protocol developed in [15]. Specifically, we apply two sets of 100 readout cycles to the A transition separated by a single \u03c0 pulse which inverts the 171 Yb qubit population.

                "In addition to the ZenPol spectra discussed in the main text, we use Hartmann-Hahn (HH) double resonance [34] to perform spectroscopy of the nuclear spin environment. This method enables spin exchange between two systems with different transition frequencies by resonantly driving a qubit with a Rabi frequency that matches the energy level splitting of the environmental nuclear spins. In our case, we resonantly drive the 171 Yb at 675 MHz to generate a pair of dressed states |\u00b1 = 1 \u221a 2 (|0 g \u00b1 i |1 g ) with splitting \u2126 which we sweep over a range \u2248 2\u03c0\u00d7(0-2.3) MHz (Extended Data Fig. 3). The 171 Yb qubit is initialised into the |-dressed state by a \u03c0/2 pulse preceding the driving period. If resonant with a nuclear spin transition, the 171 Yb qubit undergoes spin exchange at a rate dictated by the interaction strength. Finally we read out the 171 Yb |+ dressed state population to determine whether spin exchange has occurred.",
                "Extended Data Fig. 3b shows experimental results of HH spectroscopy where we vary both the HH drive Rabi frequency (\u2126) and also the HH pulse duration (t). The counts plotted on the colour-bar are proportional to the |+ dressed state population. We find three clear resonances at evenly spaced pulse amplitudes 0.15, 0.30 and 0.45 corresponding to the \u03c9 a , \u03c9 b and \u03c9 c 51 V transitions; notably, unlike ZenPol, the HH sequence only has one harmonic leading to a single resonant interaction per transition. Also note the lack of oscillations when varying the pulse duration, t, on resonance with either of the three transitions: this is because the spin exchange is driven by the randomised, Overhauser field induced 171 Yb dipole moment. For this reason, the HH sequence cannot be used to generate the coherent exchange interaction necessary to realise a swap gate for our system. In the case of no driving (\u2126 = 0), the signal rapidly saturates as t increases as a result of Ramsey dephasing of the initial state. However, as \u2126 exceeds the 171 Yb spin linewidth (\u223c 50 kHz [15]), this effect diminishes due to the emergence of spin-locking effects and consequently leads to an increased saturation timescale when not resonant with the 51 V transitions. The resolution of this measurement is also limited by the 171 Yb spin linewidth, and we therefore cannot resolve the splitresonance structure observed in the ZenPol spectra. The results agree well with simulations (Extended Data Fig. 3c) indicating that interactions with the 51 V quadrupolar structure dominate these measurements."

                "Polarisation dynamics are explored using the PROPI method (polarisation readout by polarisation inversion) [52]. This sequence uses the back-action of the 51 V spins on the 171 Yb to measure the register polarisation after successive ZenPol polarisation cycles. For instance, when polarising into |\u2191 = |\u00b15/2 on the \u03c9 c transition, the 171 Yb is initialised into |1 g and undergoes spin exchange with any 51 V population in |\u2193 = |\u00b17/2 . The 171 Yb |0 g population after interaction is therefore related to the residual 51 V |\u2193 population. As presented in Extended Data Fig. 5a, we measure the 171 Yb population after each of 20 consecutive polarisation cycles and observe a saturation after 10 cycles, indicating that the 171 Yb polarisation has been transferred to the 51 V register. The high-contrast signal obtained in this measurement is enabled by alternating the 51 V polarisation direction, i.e. periods of polarisation into |\u2191 are interleaved with periods of polarisation into |\u2193 . This mitigates the need to wait for slow register thermalisation (T (0) 1 = 0.54 s, see Supplementary Information Section J) between consecutive experiment repetitions. These measurements are repeated with ZenPol sequences on the \u03c9 b transition, demonstrating similar levels of polarisation saturation after approximately 10 cycles (Extended Data Fig. 5b).",
                "We also demonstrate the effect of incomplete register polarisation on the spin-exchange oscillation by varying the number of polarisation cycles on the \u03c9 b and \u03c9 c transitions before each experiment (Extended Data Fig. 5c). As expected, we see that coherent spin-exchange oscillations emerge as an increasing number of polarisation cycles are applied.",
                "These results inform the design of polarisation sequences used in subsequent single-spin excitation experiments where 40 polarisation cycles interleaved between the \u03c9 b and \u03c9 c transitions are sufficient to polarise the register into |0 v = |\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193 . Based on simulations discussed in Supplementary Information Section D we estimate this protocol achieves \u2248 84% polarisation into the |0 v state. Note that we don't use the ZenPol sequence to directly polarise the \u03c9 a transition due to spectral overlap with \u03c9 b and \u03c9 c (Fig. 2b). We postulate that the high degree of polarisation can still be achieved even in the absence of direct \u03c9 a transition control due to two factors:",
                "1. The thermalisation timescale of the \u03c9 a transition is significantly shorter than the interrogation time. Specifically, our experiments typically run for several minutes whereas the \u03c9 a thermalisation rate is likely similar to T (0) 1 = 0.54 s. Thus, undesired population in the |\u00b11/2 level can still pumped to |\u00b17/2 once it relaxes to |\u00b13/2 . 2. Once successfully initialised into the \u03c9 c manifold the probability of shelving into the |\u00b11/2 level is small as it necessitates two consecutive decays on the \u03c9 b and \u03c9 a transitions, both of which are considerably slower than our experiment/polarisation repetition rate (20 ms).",
                "We tried to improve the polarisation fidelity by incorporating direct driving on the \u03c9 a transition using the method in Extended Data Fig. 7 during the polarisation protocol, thus leading to fast population exchange between |\u00b11/2 and |\u00b13/2 . However, there was no improvement to the contrast of the resulting spin exchange oscillations thereby indicating that shelving into |\u00b11/2 is not a limiting factor in our experiments."

More specifically, the spin-preserving exchange interaction, \u015c-\u00ce+ + \u015c+ \u00ce-, couples the state 51 V state with two spins in |\u2191 . To avoid undesired excitation to states outside of the effective {|0 v , |W v } manifold, we always prepare the 171 Yb qubit in |0 g before retrieving stored states from the 51 V register. Hence the swap gate realised by this interaction operates on a limited basis of states.",

The 171 Yb optical and microwave frequencies were re-calibrated for each ion, however, all aspects of the experimental sequences related to register control and readout were identical."

For instance, direct microwave driving of the register \u03c9 c transition would lead to Rabi oscillation between |0 v and |1 v and could therefore be used to realise local gates in this basis. Additionally, a second spin excitation is not allowed in this scheme, therefore the ZenPol sequence reproduces a complete two-qubit swap gate regardless of the 171 Yb state.

By applying periodic \u03c0 pulses to the 171 Yb, we flip its state between |0 g and |1 g , thereby switching the sign of the Knight field. This leads to the cancellation of 51 V phase accumulation between successive free evolution periods, resulting in a longer coherence time. We numerically simulate the register coherence times using the method outlined in Supplementary Information Section D. When limited by the 171 Yb Knight field, simulation yields a Gaussian decay with a 1/e coherence time of 33 \u00b5s (equivalent to experimental results in Fig. 3a). We also predict an upper bound for the coherence time when decoupled from the 171 Yb Knight field by turning off Hamiltonian terms associated with equation (S28), yielding an extended Gaussian decay of 417 \u00b5s (equivalent to experimental results in Fig. 3b).
