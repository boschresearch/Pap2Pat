                        "A main challenge in indoor localization arises from the lack of reliable distance measures due to the presence of walls, floors, furniture, and other dynamically changing conditions such as the movement of people and goods, varying temperature, and air flows. In this work, instead of direct use of unreliably measured distances, ordinal data that are obtained from pairwise distance comparisons is used. Such ordinal data are generally more reliable than direct distance measures. A computational framework, referred to as Ordinal UNLOC, estimates the location of target(s) based on ordinal data. The accuracy of location estimation using the framework is illustrated using numerical simulations.",
                        "A recent FCC document highlights the need for increasing the accuracy of localization when users call from mobile devices from indoor environments [1]. While the FCC recommends accurate localization to within 3 meters within 30 seconds, reports show that 90 percent of test calls have localization error greater than 100 meters. With a majority of 911 calls now being made from wireless devices, over 56 percent of which from indoor locations, the need for accurate indoor localization is paramount. A poor localization scheme can cause incorrect estimation of the room, the floor or even the actual building from which the call originates. In practice, despite being recognized as an important problem whose satisfactory solution can greatly improve safety, user experience, and be of critical importance in emergency situations such as rescuing people from collapsed and/or burning buildings, accurate indoor localization remains an open problem. In most buildings including the majority of schools, hospitals and shopping malls, there is generally no existing infrastructure (serving as \u201cindoor GPS system\u201d) to facilitate localization. While in most cases it is possible to set up such an infrastructure with WiFi routers or Bluetooth beacons, the indoor setting poses a challenge. This is because indoor environments generally feature complex mutlipaths due to the presence of physical obstacles and barriers (e.g., walls, furniture, and people) and other factors that makes the accurate measurement of distance, either directly or indirectly, unreliable. Without reliable distance information, accurate localization seems to be a hopeless task.",
                        "Predominant research on indoor localization focuses on addressing the lack of infrastructure, by utilizing wireless sensor networks (WSN). The main idea is to place set of (low-cost, mobile) wireless sensors (called anchors) in a given environment where localization is to be performed. These sensors, together with the target node that is to be localized, form a sensor network via wireless communications. Assuming that the communication between the anchors and the target produces reasonable estimate of the distance between those, such approximate anchor-to-target distances together with the known location of the anchors are used to estimate the location of the target. Under this framework, many methods have been developed for target localization based on noisy distance measures, including multilateration and triangulation, linear and nonlinear optimization. However, as noted earlier, these types of methods are not suitable for practical indoor localization since the distances measured between the sensors, typically inferred from proxies such as time and power signals, are generally unreliable in indoor environments.",

                        "The present disclosure is directed to an estimation framework, referred to as Ordinal UNLOC, for indoor localization from possibly incomplete and noisy ordinal data. In this framework, direct measurement of distances is no longer required. Instead, comparative distances between pairs of devices are obtained, using (for example) signal strength measures or receive clock times in the case of time delay techniques, producing reliable ordinal distance comparisons. Thus, the crucial difference between the proposed approach and conventional localization methods is that in the Ordinal UNLOC approach, accurate sensor-to-sensor distance information is not required. Instead, all that is needed is to determine, between any pair sensors, which one is closer to a given reference sensor. The objective is to use these ordinal data in order to estimate the location of the target. The first step involves solving a \u201crank aggregation\u201d problem, which, from the ordinal pairwise comparisons, produces a set of dissimilarities which serve as proximities for distances. Next, since the dissimilarities generally differ from actual distances, a set of functions are learned that transforms dissimilarities into distances, using available distance data measured among the anchorsthose sensors for which the locations are known a priori. Finally, using the anchor-to-target distances estimated in the previous step, the location of the target is inferred by formulating and solving a multidimensional \u201cunfolding\u201d optimization. Thus, the Ordinal UNLOC approach takes special advantage of established techniques from machine learning, statistics, and optimization, to solve an outstanding practical engineering problem in signal processing.",

                        "Referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment, is a sensor field 100 in an indoor environment. Sensors are classified based on whether their locations are known or unknown: sensors at known locations are referred to as anchors 102 and those at unknown locations as target nodes or simply targets (or nodes) 104. Sensors 102/104 are any hardware device configured with sensing and wireless communications capabilities, such as smart phones, for example. As an example, the sensor could be a sound sensor (microphone), such that audio inputs can be sensed and the methodology employed for localizing audio signals, such as in shooter localization, and tracking pests such as mice based on their squeaks. An aspect of the invention is to focus on the challenging problem of localization where direct distance measures are not available, but only ordinal data that come from comparative anchor-to-target distances, as describe by the system model below. The system contains m anchors 102 at known locations and n target nodes 104 at unknown locations within the indoor environment. The total number of sensors is denoted as:\n\n\n- - N=m+n.

Typically q=2 or q=3 in practical\n    applications. We classify the distances between sensor pairs into\n    three types: anchor-to-anchor, anchor-to-target, and\n    target-to-target, which we represent using three matrices:\n    D^(Y)=\\[d_(ij)^(Y)\\]_(m\u00d7m), D^(X)=\\[d_(ij)^(X)\\]_(n\u00d7n), and\n    D^(YX)=\\[d_(ij)^(YX)\\]_(m\u00d7n), respectively, where",

The unavailability of the anchor-to-target distances (as encoded in DYX and DXY) is in contrast to most localization setups. Instead, the only reliable information are ordinal comparisons between anchor-sensor distance measurements (we use ordinal comparisons since the actual distance measurements, especially in indoor environments are unreliable [16]-[18], [36]-[38]). In particular, for each sensor triplet (i, j, k), compare the \u201csignal strengths\u201d from sensor i and from sensor j can be compared to the reference sensor k, respectively, to determine which sensor (between i and j) is closer to k.",

Such set of spatial proximities (scores) are not unique, as any shifting and (positive) scaling preserves the ranking of the scores. Consequently, the scores obtained in this step cannot be directly used as (approximate) anchor-to-target distances for localization. Next, the estimated distance proximities among the anchors together with the (known) anchor-to-anchor distances are used to fit functions that best transform proximities into distances, and such functions are then applied to obtain an estimation of anchor-to-target distances. Finally, given the location of anchors and (estimated) anchor-to-target distances, we formulate a multidimensional unfolding optimization for each target, whose solution represents a (best) estimation of the location of that target. Below the details of each of these main steps are described, along with brief discussion of their effects."
