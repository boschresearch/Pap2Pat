    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade of programmed death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibody drugs has delivered breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer. Nonetheless, small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors could lead to increases in treatment efficacy, safety, and global access. While the ligand-binding surface of apo-PD-1 is relatively flat, it harbors a striking pocket in the murine PD-1/PD-L2 structure. An analogous pocket in human PD-1 may serve as a small-molecule drug target, but the structure of the human complex is unknown. Because the CC\u2032 and FG loops in murine PD-1 adopt new conformations upon binding PD-L2, we hypothesized that mutations in these two loops could be coupled to pocket formation and alter PD-1\u2019s affinity for PD-L2. Here, we conducted deep mutational scanning in these loops and used yeast surface display to select for enhanced PD-L2 binding. A PD-1 variant with three substitutions binds PD-L2 with an affinity two orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type protein, permitting crystallization of the complex. We determined the X-ray crystal structures of the human triple-mutant PD-1/PD-L2 complex and the apo triple-mutant PD-1 variant at 2.0 \u00c5 and 1.2 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. Binding of PD-L2 is accompanied by formation of a prominent pocket in human PD-1, as well as substantial conformational changes in the CC\u2032 and FG loops. The structure of the apo triple-mutant PD-1 shows that the CC\u2032 loop adopts the ligand-bound conformation, providing support for allostery between the loop and pocket. This human PD-1/PD-L2 structure provide critical insights for the design and discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors. Significance Statement",

                "Immune checkpoint blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 1 (PD-L1) has dramatically increased progression-free survival for many cancers (1)(2)(3). The first time that the FDA approved a cancer treatment based on a genetic biomarker rather than the primary site of origin was in 2017, when the monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda \u00ae ), received approval for use in patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient solid tumors (4,5). Indeed, mAb drugs inhibiting immune checkpoints have ushered in an exciting new chapter in oncology.",
                "Nevertheless, there is a desire for small-molecule inhibitors of immune checkpoints. First, in general, small molecules are expected to penetrate more effectively than mAbs into the tumor microenvironment, perhaps enhancing efficacy (6). In addition, if penetration into the brain is desired, small molecules can be effective (7,8). Second, there are rare but severe immune-related side effects of checkpoint inhibition that require immediate drug discontinuation (9)(10)(11)(12). Since mAbs have long half-lives in the body (typically weeks) (13), the treatment of such severe immunerelated side effects is primarily supportive. Small-molecule checkpoint inhibitors could offer convenient dosing (e.g., once per day) while allowing for prompt drug removal if desired (14). Finally, small-molecule immune checkpoint inhibitors would facilitate cancer treatment in low-and middle-income countries by reducing production costs and eliminating the need for refrigeration during transportation and storage, in contrast to mAbs (15). Despite substantial efforts (16,17), there are no well-characterized smallmolecule ligands for PD-1.",
                "The ligand-binding surface of human PD-1 is generally flat, lacking pockets considered suitable for binding small molecules (18). However, upon binding to PD-L1, a modest cavity forms on the ligand-binding surface of PD-1 (19). A similar cavity forms in murine PD-1 upon binding of PD-L1 (20). Importantly, when murine PD-1 binds a different ligand, PD-L2 (21), this cavity extends (Figures 1A-B) to a volume comparable to that occupied by established small-molecule inhibitors (22)(23)(24)(25). Unfortunately, this murine structure is insufficient to provide a structural model for the analogous pocket in the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex, as the human and murine PD-1 proteins share sequence identities of only 63% (26).",
                "Although the murine PD-1/PD-L2 structure was determined over a decade ago (21), the structure of the human complex has not been reported. Our previous attempts to obtain diffraction-quality crystals of the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex were unsuccessful. Analyses of earlier structural studies (21,26) revealed that formation of cavities on the ligand-binding surface of PD-1 is accompanied by changes in the structures of the CC\u2032 and FG loops (Figure 1C). We therefore hypothesized that substitutions in these loops could have an allosteric effect on the conformations of PD-1 in the pocket region and alter its affinity for PD-L2. Using deep mutational scanning (27,28) and yeast surface display (29), we selected for CC\u2032 and FG loop variants of human PD-1 with enhanced PD-L2 binding. We identified a triple-mutant PD-1 that binds PD-L2 with nanomolar affinity and is amenable to crystallization, both alone and as a complex. The resulting X-ray crystal structures confirm that a prominent pocket forms in human PD-1 upon binding of PD-L2 and support the notion of allostery between the pocket and the CC\u2032 and FG loops. The pocket identified here in human PD-1 can serve as a template for virtual drug discovery (30) and opens up additional avenues for the discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors."

                                "Substantial efforts by us and others (31) to crystallize the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex were previously unsuccessful. Earlier studies (18,19,21) indicated that the PD-1 ligand-binding interface consists of a hydrophobic core, the CC\u2032 loop, and the FG loop (Figure 2A), and that formation of a complex with ligands results in loop movement and pocket formation in the hydrophobic core. We hypothesized that mutations in these two loops of PD-1 were coupled to pocket formation and could alter PD-1's affinity for PD-L2. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that poly-glycine mutants of these loops in human PD-1 substantially decreased affinities for PD-L2 (Figures S1A-B).",
                                "Since we were particularly interested in the structure of the PD-1 pocket when bound to PD-L2, we maintained residues in the hydrophobic core and performed directed evolution exclusively in the CC\u2032 loop (residues 70-78) and the FG loop (residues 127-133) of human PD-1. We used deep mutational scanning (27,28) to construct loop-variant libraries with trinucleotides encoding each of 20 residues at each position. We next used yeast surface display (29) (Table S1) with a recombinant human PD-L2-human Fc fusion protein as the selection agent (Figure 2B). After two rounds of selection using magnetic-and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (MACS and FACS) (Figure 2C), we isolated human PD-1 loop-variant clones with single-residue substitutions. Substitutions at two residues were identified in the CC\u2032 loop (N74G and T76P) and at one residue in the FG loop (A132V, A132L) (Figure 2D). In contrast, when we used the same yeast library and selected with PD-L1-Fc, we only isolated the A132 substitutions as high-affinity variants (Figures S1C-E), suggesting that the N74G and T76P variants are PD-L2-binding specific. We chose PD-1 T76P as a template to generate a second PD-1 loop variant library and selected for further enhancement of PD-L2 binding (Figure 2C). As a result, we obtained a PD-1 triple mutant (Figures S1F-G) that contains all three substitutions identified from the first library: N74G, T76P, and A132V."

                                        "To validate the detected enhancement in affinity, we recombinantly expressed and purified human PD-1 and the loop variants, as well as the human PD-L2 and PD-L1 ectodomain proteins. Using bio-layer interferometry, we compared the binding of PD-L2 to wild-type PD-1 and to the variants (Figures 3A andS2A). Wild-type PD-1 binds PD-L2 with a KD of 500 nM; the variants all exhibit increased PD-L2 affinity, with KD values of 170 nM for N74G, 12 nM for T76P, and 69 nM for A132V (Figure 3C). Remarkably, the PD-1 triple mutant has a KD of 2.6 nM for PD-L2, constituting a ~200-fold increase in affinity (Figure 3C). The triple mutant also shows substantially higher affinity for PD-L1 (Figures 3B-C). The A132V mutant has higher affinity for PD-L1, consistent with previous reports (21,(31)(32)(33), but the N74G and T76P single mutants have minor effects (Figures 3B-C andS2B-C). Thus, this human PD-1 triple mutant exhibits a potent enhancement of binding affinity for both PD-L1 and PD-L2.",
                                        "Bio-layer interferometry of ligand binding also enabled us to determine association constants (kon). Compared to wild-type PD-1, all loop variants showed increased kon for binding PD-L2 (Figure 3C). The PD-1 triple mutant underwent a 3-fold increase of kon for PD-L2, and a 14-fold increase for PD-L1 (Figure 3C). These results suggest that these amino acid substitutions in the loops stabilize the ligand-bound state among the conformational ensembles of apo-PD-1 ((34); see however, (35))."

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove all N-linked glycosylation sites in each protein in an effort to aid crystallization (Table S2). Co-expression of the PD-1 triple mutant and the immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain of PD-L2 yielded a stable and 1:1 stoichiometric complex (Figures S3A-B). We successfully obtained crystals of the human PD-1 N74G T76P A132V /PD-L2 IgV complex and determined an X-ray cocrystal structure at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution (Figures 4A, S3C-D). The crystal contains one PD-1/PD-L2 complex per asymmetric unit, with space group P 21 21 21 (Table 1). This structure reveals that the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex adopts an overall architecture similar to that previously determined for the murine PD-1/PD-L2 complex (21) with a C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation (R.M.S.D.) of 3.8 \u00c5.

In the interface, notable interacting residues include the three highly conserved aromatics W110L2, Y112L2, and Y114L2 from \u03b2G of the PD-L2 IgV domain. The sidechains of these residues point into the center of the PD-1 ligand-binding surface (Figures S4A-B). To validate the interactions observed at the PD-1/PD-L2 interface, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on several PD-1 and PD-L2 interfacial residues. Bio-layer interferometry revealed reduced binding of PD-1 interface mutants to PD-L2, and PD-L2 interface mutants to PD-1 (Figures S4C-D), consistent with our co-crystal structure. The high-affinity loop substitutions of PD-1 localize to the interface (Figure 4B). Among them, T76P and A132V make additional contacts to PD-L2 that likely contribute to the increase in affinity (Figures S4E-H)."

Although the human apo-PD-1 variant has a flat ligand-binding interface (Figure 5A), there are rearrangements in this interface upon binding PD-L2. These rearrangements involve residues in \u03b2C (F63, V64, N66, Y68), \u03b2F (L122, G124, I126), \u03b2G (I134, E136), and the C\u2032D loop (E84) to form a deep and extended pocket (Figure 5B). Each of these residues in PD-1 is within 4.4 \u00c5 of a PD-L2 residue (Figure S4I). This pocket accommodates PD-L2 sidechains including the aromatic residues W110L2 and Y112L2 (Figure 5C).",

The human pocket adopts an open, funnel-shaped architecture. Compared to the murine pocket (Figures 1B, S6B-C), the human pocket has a wider entrance and a narrower exit (Figure 5B). The distinct pocket geometries arise from at least two factors. First, human PD-1 employs a different subset of interfacial residues to form the pocket than the murine version. Human PD-1 lacks an ordered \u03b2C\u2032\u2032 strand and thus the open pocket is formed by rearranging residues F63, V64, and E84. In contrast, the murine pocket is closed, with sidechains of A81 and S83 forming a boundary (Figures S6A-B). Second, several sequence variations exist among the residues that form the pocket. For example, V64 and Y68 in human PD-1 are substituted with M64 and N68 in murine PD-1, respectively (Figures 5B andS6B). To quantitatively evaluate the pocket dimensions, we measured pocket volumes using POCASA 1.1 (40). The human and murine pockets have volumes of 170 \u00c5 3 and 220 \u00c5 3 , respectively. Notably, these pockets are comparable in size to other protein cavities with established small-molecule inhibitors (160-800 \u00c5 3 ) (22)(23)(24)(25).",

Superimposing the two structures resulted in a C\u03b1 R.M.S.D. of 1.5 \u00c5 for PD-1 residues. Binding PD-L1 triggers formation of a much smaller cavity in human PD-1, with a volume of 80 \u00c5 3 (Figure S6D). PD-L1 lacks a large aromatic sidechain corresponding to W110L2, so the PD-1 rearrangement only involves accommodation of a small subset of the interfacial residues, including the sidechain of Y123L1, which corresponds to PD-L2 residue Y112L2 (Figures S6E-H). These results indicate that the core of the human PD-1 interface has remarkable structural plasticity, with the ability to form pockets with varied dimensions to interact with different PD-1 ligands."

Strikingly, in the absence of ligands, the CC\u2032 loop conformations of the PD-1 triple and double mutants resemble those of the ligandbound conformations (Figure S7A).

When the PD-1 triple mutant binds PD-L2, the sidechain of P76 maintains the same conformation as the unbound protein (Figure 6A).

                                                "We speculate that this pocket represents an attractive drug target. How would a pocket-binding drug bind to a flat protein surface? We conceptualize an ensemble of PD-1 conformations (Figure S8) in which the predominant species of apo-PD-1 has a flat ligand-binding surface (Ki < 1). A pocket-binding drug will stabilize the PD-1 conformation containing the pocket (Kiii). Drug binding via an induced-fit mechanism (Kiv > 1) can also occur.",
                                                "The human PD-1/PD-L2 structure reported here will facilitate virtual drug screening to identify potential lead compounds (e.g., (30)). Specifically, we envision a small molecule binding to PD-1 contacting all or many of the residues that form the pocket, particularly F63, V64, N66, Y68, E84, L122, G124, I126, I134, and E136 in a conformation similar to that formed in the complex with PD-L2 (Figure 5B). In addition, the structures of the indole and phenyl rings and neighboring sidechains of PD-L2 when bound to the pocket (Figure 5C) are potentially useful starting points for the design of fragment-based screening scaffolds (41,42).",
                                                "Since the PD-1 pocket is not populated substantially in the absence of PD-L2, it is not straightforward to use traditional drug-screening methods to identify small molecules that bind the pocket. Nonetheless, we speculate that conformational changes in the CC\u2032 and FG loops and formation of pockets in the ligand-binding interface of PD-1 are thermodynamically coupled (Figure 7) and that this coupling can be used to enable drug-discovery efforts. We envision that PD-1 exists in an ensemble of conformations in the absence of ligands, populating predominantly structures that contain a flat ligandbinding face (i.e., K1 < 1). PD-1 molecules with a pre-formed pocket have a higher affinity for PD-L2 (K3 > K2). Thermodynamics dictates that K1K3 = K2K4, so K4 > K1. In this model, the PD-1 loop variants studied here increase K1, and lead to a higher proportion of apo-PD-1 in the PD-L2-bound conformation.",
                                                "The higher association constants (kon) for binding ligands by the mutant PD-1, as compared to wild-type PD-1 (Figures 3C andS2C), support this model. Such kinetic properties are consistent with an increased fraction, relative to wild-type PD-1, of unliganded mutant PD-1 molecules that are in a ligand-bound conformation ((34); see however, (35)). In addition, the CC\u2032 loop shifts toward the PD-L2-bound conformation in the apo-PD-1 triple and double mutants (Figure S7A). (While there are only minimal changes in the pocket in both apo-PD-1 mutants (Figure 5A), the pocket residues and a neighboring FG loop have substantial crystal contacts in the lattice (Figure S5H) that likely interfere with conformational changes.)",
                                                "Coupling between the pocket and the loops would stabilize the pocket in the absence of a ligand, for example if the loops were held in their PD-L2-bound conformations with antibodies or aptamers. Alternatively, or in addition, new mutations (e.g., amino acid replacements, insertions and/or deletions) could be selected for or designed to induce conformational changes in the loops. This coupling could therefore enable more traditional approaches to small-molecule drug discovery, such as high-throughput screening (43,44) and/or the discovery of allosteric regulators of PD-1 activity. More generally, our work has implications for enhancing discovery of smallmolecule inhibitors of other \"undruggable\" protein-protein interactions."

For the amplicon, we used the cDNA encoding human PD-1 21-150 with 120 base-pairs of upstream and 227 base-pairs of downstream DNA sequences in the yeast-display plasmid of pST892 -pRS414 PGAL1-AGA2-PD1 21-150 -Myc. The upstream sequence is from the Factor Xa site to PD-1 P20 , and the downstream is from PD-1 E150 to the end of the ADH1 terminator. This amplicon was produced by PCR and diluted to 3 ng/\u03bcL. We combined forward oligonucleotides that contained a randomized NNN trinucleotide in codons encoding amino acids of the CC\u2032 ( 70 MSPSNQTDK 78 ) and/or FG ( 127 SLAPKAQ 133 ) loops of human PD-1 in equimolar quantities to create three forward-mutagenesis primer pools: one for the CC\u2032 loop, one for the FG loop, and one combining both loops.
