                        "Immune checkpoint blockade of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 1 (PD-L1) has dramatically increased progression-free survival for many cancers (1-3). For example, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae), received regulatory approval for use in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors (4, 5). While mAb drugs inhibiting immune checkpoints are highly useful in oncology, there is a desire for other types of inhibitors of immune checkpoints, such as small-molecules. Small-molecule drugs targeting PD-1 may lead to increases in efficacy and safety of cancer treatment, as well to improved access to cancer treatments."

                        "Other than mAbs, compounds targeting human PD-1 so far have been out of reach. Development of human PD-1-binding drugs is hindered by the fact that the ligand-binding surface of human PD-1 is generally flat, lacking identifiable binding pockets that can serve as drug targets during computational screening of small molecule libraries and computational drug modelling efforts. Only a small cavity forms when human PD-1 binds one of its in-vivo ligands, PD-L1. The small volume of the PD-L1 binding cavity in human PD-1 prevents its use for computational modelling of PD-1 interactions with its ligands. While it is known that, in murine PD-1, the PD-L1-binding cavity extends upon binding of a different in-vivo ligand, PD-L2, the cavity of murine PD-1 cannot provide a structural model due to low sequence similarity between human and murine PD-1 proteins. As described in more detail further in the present disclosure, the inventors were able to design a substituted variant of human PD-1 that binds PD-L2 with an affinity that is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type protein, and to crystallize and, using X-ray crystallography, determine to high resolution the structures of the human PD-1 variant and the complex of the human PD-1 variant with PD-L2. As a result, a prominent pocket on the ligand-binding surface of human PD-1 was identified. The structure of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 is described in the present disclosure. The structure of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 is useful, for example, in the drug discovery, design and optimization methods, such as, but not limited to, the methods that involve computational (in silico) screening of small molecule libraries for candidate small molecules capable of binding to of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1, the methods that involve computational identification of ligands capable of interacting with the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1, and any methods that involve computational docking of ligands to the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1. Such methods are included among the embodiments of the present invention and are described in the present disclosure.",

                        "PD-1 is a receptor expressed by T cells, B cells, and monocytes, and is a potent regulator of immune responses (16). PD-1 is an attractive target for anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. PD-1 has two known protein ligands in vivo, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which bind to the same region on the surface of PD-1. It would be desirable to identify other ligands, including, but not limited to small molecule compounds, that would bind to this region of human PD-1 and interfere with its binding to PD-L1 and/or PD-L2. Such ligands, once identified, may be used as lead compounds for drug development and tested for potential biological activity, such as anti-cancer activity, by suitable in vitro and/or in vivo assays. However, it is currently impossible to identify in silico the ligands that would specifically and efficiently bind to PD-1 ligand-binding site, because the PD-1 ligand-binding site lacks a defined binding pocket in the absence of its in vivo ligands. Although the structure of human PD-1/PD-L1 complex has been determined, and a model of PD-L1 binding cavity of human PD-1 exists, the volume of PD-1 binding cavity in the above model is too small for the model to be used effectively in computational studies of PD-1/ligand interactions. As a consequence, until the discoveries described in the present disclosure, effective computational of PD-1/ligand interactions were intractable, making it impossible, for example, to pre-select a reasonable number of lead ligands, such as small-molecule compounds for further testing with in vitro and/or in vivo assays for PD-1 signaling in order to identify biologically active ligands that can be used as drug candidates in pre-clinical and/or clinical testing. The absence of a model of binding PD-1/PD-L1 binding cavity also prevented in silico rational drug design and optimization studies.",
                        "The available structures of murine PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-1/PD-L2 complexes showed that a modest binding cavity was formed upon PD-L1 binding, and the cavity extended to a volume suitable for small-molecule ligands only upon PD-L2 binding to murine PD-1. However, the model of the structure of murine PD-1/PD-L2 complex is unsuitable for human drug development due to low sequence similarity between the human and murine PD-1 proteins. Since human PD-1 protein has a very mobile structure, all the multiple previous attempts to crystalize human PD-1/PD-L2 complex and determine the structure of PD-1 ligand binding pocket failed. As described in the present disclosure, the inventors were able to stabilize the structure of PD-1/PD-L2 complex by mutating several residues in two mobile loops (CC\u2032 and FG) of PD-1, which increased the affinity of PD-1 for PD-L2. The inventors were then able to crystallize the PD-1/PD-L2 complex and determine the structure of the PD-L2 binding pocket. The model of the structure of human PD-1/PD-L2 binding pocket can now be used for drug discovery and development. One non-limiting example of the drug discovery and development process in which the structure of human PD-1/PD-L2 binding pocket can be used, is a process that involves computational screening of compounds to identify PD-1 ligands (\u201cleads\u201d). In the above process, screened compounds can be small molecules. For example, libraries of small compounds (small-molecule libraries) can be computationally screed according to various procedures, some of which are described in the present disclosure, to identify candidate small molecules capable of binding to a PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1. Based on the results of the computational screening, potential leads can be tested by appropriate in vitro and/or in vivo testing to identify the compounds that affect PD-1 signaling. Another non-limiting example in which the structure of human PD-1/PD-L2 binding pocket can be used is a process that involves computational design and testing of candidate ligands (\u201cleads\u201d), which can subsequently be tested by appropriate in vitro and/or in vivo testing to identify the compounds that affect PD-1 signaling. Prior to the determination of the structure, described in the present disclosure, of human PD-1/PD-L2 binding pocket, it was impossible to identify computationally (in silico) the leads for subsequent in vitro and/or in vivo testing identify the compounds that affect PD-1 signaling. Although in vitro and/or in vivo testing without prior in silico lead identification was theoretically possible, it was, in practice, unworkable due to the high costs (including monetary, time, labor and animal lives required for the testing) that would be required to test large numbers of essentially randomly selected compounds with low probability of success. The discoveries described in the present disclosure permit carrying out the processes related to drug discovery, such as, but not limited to, screening of small molecules and rational drug design, in which in vitro and/or in vivo testing of lead compounds can be implement practically and effectively due to the now available capability to perform the initial steps of lead screening and/or design computationally, thereby drastically reducing the number of the leads that need to be tested in vitro and/or in vivo to identify biologically active PD-1 ligands that can serve as drug candidates in subsequent pre-clinical and clinical testing.",
                        "An exemplary amino acid sequence of human PD-1 protein is shown as SEQ ID NO:1. The present disclosure describes, among other things, structures of the human triple-mutant PD-1/PD-L2 complex and the apo triple-mutant PD-1 variant obtained using X-ray crystallography at 2.0 \u212b and 1.2 \u212b resolution, respectively. The structures described in the present disclosure revealed that binding of PD-L2 to human PD-1 was accompanied by formation of a prominent pocket in human PD-1, as well as substantial conformational changes of the CC\u2032 and FG loops. The structure of human apo triple-mutant PD-1 revealed that the CC\u2032 loop adopted the ligand-bound conformation, providing support for allostery between the loop and pocket. The structures of human PD-1/PD-L2 described in the present disclosure are useful for design and discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors. While mAb drugs inhibiting immune checkpoints, such as pembrolizumab, are highly useful in oncology, small-molecule inhibitors of immune checkpoints are highly desirable. Small molecule inhibitors are expected to penetrate more effectively than mAbs in the tumor microenvironment, which can enhance their efficacy (6). In addition, if penetration into the brain is desired, small molecule inhibitors can be effective (7, 8). Also, there are rare but severe immune-related side effects of checkpoint inhibition that call for immediate drug discontinuation (9, 10). Since mAbs have long half-lives in the body (typically, weeks) (11), the treatment of such severe immune-related side effects is primarily supportive. Small-molecule checkpoint inhibitors can offer the potential for convenient dosing (e.g., once a day), while allowing for prompt drug removal, if desired (12). Small-molecule immune checkpoint inhibitors can facilitate treatment of cancers in low- and middle-income countries by reducing production costs and eliminating the need for refrigeration during transportation and storage, as compared to mAbs (13). Despite substantial efforts, currently there are no well-characterized small-molecule ligands for PD-1 (14, 15).",
                        "In vivo, PD-1 binds two distinct ligands, PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1 or CD274) and PD-L2 (also known as B7-DC) (16). The ligand-binding surface of human PD-1 is generally flat, lacking pockets considered suitable for binding small molecules (16). However, upon binding to PD-L1, a modest cavity forms on the ligand binding surface of PD-1 (17). A similar cavity is formed in murine PD-1 upon binding PD-L1 (18). When murine PD-1 binds PD-L2 (19), this cavity extends to a volume comparable to that occupied by established small-molecule inhibitors (20, 21). Unfortunately, currently available structure of murine PD-1/PD-L2 complex is insufficient to provide a structural model for the analogous pocket in the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex, as the human and murine PD-1 proteins share sequence identities of only about 63% (22). Although the structure of murine PD-1/PD-L2 complex was determined over a decade ago, the structure of the human complex has not yet been obtained due to various difficulties. Previous attempts to obtain diffraction-quality crystals of human PD-1/PD-L2 complex were unsuccessful.",
                        "The inventors realized that formation of cavities on the ligand-binding surface of PD-1 is accompanied by changes in the structures of the CC\u2032 and FG loops. The inventors further realized that substitutions in these loops can have an allosteric effect on the conformations of PD-1 in the pocket region and alter its affinity for PD-L2. Using deep-mutational scanning (24) and yeast-surface display (25), the CC\u2032 and FG loop variants of human PD-1 with enhanced PD-L2 binding were selected. A triple-mutant PD-1 was identified that binds PD-L2 with nanomolar affinity and is amenable to crystallization, both alone and as a complex. The formation of a prominent pocket in human PD-1 upon binding PD-L2 revealed by the X-ray crystal structures described in the present disclosure supports the notion of allostery between the pocket and the CC\u2032 and FG loops. The pocket identified in human PD-1 can serve as a template for virtual drug discovery (26) and opens up additional avenues for the discovery of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors.",
                        "The prominent pocket formed in human PD-1 upon binding PD-L2 has a volume of 130 \u212b3, comparable to those pockets that bind small-molecule drugs (20, 21, 35). The structure of the pocket in human PD-1 described in the present disclosure is quite distinct from the corresponding pocket in murine PD-1 when bound to PD-L2 (19). The pocket in human PD-1 described in the present disclosure represents an attractive drug target. It is envisioned that a small molecule binding to PD-1 contacting all or many of the residues that form the pocket, particularly F63, V64, N66, Y68, E84, L122, G124, I126, I134, and E136 in a conformation similar to that formed in the complex with PD-L2, as illustrated in FIG. 2B. The structure of human PD-1/PD-L2 complex is useful for virtual drug screening to identify potential lead compounds (see e.g., (26)). In addition, the structures of the indole and phenyl rings and neighboring sidechains of PD-L2 when bound to the pocket, as illustrated in FIG. 2C, are useful for the design of fragment-based screening scaffolds (36, 37).",
                        "Conformational changes in the CC\u2032 and FG loops can be coupled to formation of pockets in the ligand-binding interface of PD-1 (FIG. 3). In this model, PD-1 exists in an ensemble of conformations in the absence of ligands, populating predominantly structures containing a flat ligand-binding face (K1<1). PD-1 molecules with a pre-formed pocket have a higher affinity for PD-L2 (i.e., K3>K2). Thermodynamics dictates that K1K3=K2K4, so K4>K1. In this model, the PD-1 loop variants studied here increase K1, and lead to a higher proportion of apo-PD-1 in the PD-L2-bound conformation. The increased association constants (kon) for binding ligands by the mutant PD-1s, as compared to wild-type PD-1 support this model. Such kinetic properties are consistent with an increase fraction of unliganded mutant PD-1 molecules that are in a ligand-bound conformation as compared to wild-type PD-1 (38, 39). In addition, the CC\u2032 loop shifts toward the PD-L2-bound conformation in the apo-PD-1 triple and double mutants. While there are only minimal changes in the pocket of human PD-1, as illustrated in FIG. 2A, the pocket residues and a neighboring FG loop have substantial crystal contacts in the lattice that likely interfere with conformational changes. Such coupling can stabilize the pocket in the absence of a ligand, for example, if the two loops were held in their PD-L2-bound conformations with antibodies or aptamers. Thus, the structures of human PD-1 described in the present disclosure are useful in drug development, such as, but not limited, to small-molecule drug discovery, such as by high-throughput screening (40, 41), and rational drug design. The structures described in the present disclosure can be used to discover, design and/or optimize PD-1 ligands, including small-molecule ligands, and can also be used in the discovery of allosteric regulators of PD-1 activity."

Interaction types may be either enthalpic or entropic in nature and may reflect either nonbonded or bonded interactions. Examples of nonbonded interaction types include, but are not limited to, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals (or dispersion) interactions between time-varying dipole moments (often related to steric complementarity), short range repulsion between overlapping atomic orbitals, hydrogen bonding, interactions involved with metal ion coordination, or interactions with one or more ordered or structural waters. Other examples of nonbonded interaction types may also include one or more solvation effects such as electrostatic desolvation (including self-reaction field polarization effects, solvent screening in a dielectric medium or interactions with a solvent-based ionic atmosphere), the hydrophobic effect, cavitation energy, and surface tension. Examples of bonded interactions include, but are not limited to, the intramolecular strain associated with distortions of equilibrium bond lengths, angles, torsions, etc., or the energy gap between cis-trans modes or the energy differential associated with changes in chirality of one or more chiral center. Examples of entropic-based interactions include the loss of conformational entropy of molecular subsets (including loss of rotameric entropy for protein side chains) upon binding or the favorable entropy gain obtained by the release of one or more ordered waters. Other more exotic interaction types may include \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, charge transfer, or other quantum mechanical phenomena.",

For example, when it is stated that the nitrogen acts as a \u201chydrogen bond donor\u201d it means that a hydrogen (H) bound to a nitrogen (N) is donated by the nitrogen as it electrostatically attracted to or accepted by an adjacent atom bearing a lone pair of electrons such as an oxygen. Similarly, when it is stated that an oxygen acts as a \u201chydrogen bond acceptor,\u201d it means that a hydrogen (H) bound to a more electronegative atom such as nitrogen (N) is electrostatically attracted to or \u201caccepted by\u201d an adjacent atom such as oxygen bearing a lone pair of electrons. Sometimes the hydrogen bonded atoms are called out without explicitly stating the origin and presence of an intermediate hydrogen atom. The term \u201chydrogen bonding\u201d is used wherever LigPlot Plus software predicts a hydrogen bonding interaction using its algorithm and applied parameters of 3.35 \u212b for maximum distance between hydrogen bond donor and acceptor. Not all hydrogen bonds may actually be in place simultaneously; this is evident for atoms that are shown to form 4 putative hydrogen bonds, where however, at any given time only 3 hydrogen bonds are chemically possible. In general, although crystal structures such as the co-crystal structural information herein does not directly show or detect hydrogen bonding, the software used to describe the co-crystal does predict such H-bonding exists. Therefore, throughout the disclosure when a H-bond is present and described, it may be said to be \u201cpredicted\u201d by software to be present.",

Steric effects are described, for example, in (48). For example, steric effects may result from repulsions between valence electrons or nonbonded atoms, leading to in an increase in the energy of the system. In the formation of a ligand-receptor complex, any group of atoms that is in van der Waals contact with the receptor or the biomolecule can be or is involved in the binding event. If a ligand binding pocket can adjust to any ligand, then no steric effect will be observed. If, however, the binding pocket has limited conformational flexibility, and this flexibility is not equivalent in all directions, then a steric effect will be observed. The steric effect will be dependent on conformational states, and the minimal steric interaction principle will probably be observed. This principle states that a substituent whose steric effect is conformationally variable will prefer a conformation that minimizes steric repulsions and will give rise to the smallest steric strain.",

The term \u201cpocket,\u201d \u201cbinding pocket\u201d or related terms can refer to a cavity on the surface or in the interior of a protein molecule that possesses suitable properties for binding a ligand. Amino acid and other residues (such as co-factors) around a pocket determine its physicochemical characteristics. Residues outside the binding site can also have a long-range effect on the properties of the binding pocket. Binding pocket can have a concave surface presenting amino acid residues in a suitable configuration for binding low molecular weight compounds (which can be referred to as \u201csmall molecules\u201d). The mobility of a protein molecule can permit opening, closing, and adaptation of binding pockets to regulate binding processes.

Chemical descriptors may be assigned based on application of one or more rules or concepts of organic (or inorganic, if appropriate) chemistry to represent chemical structures that must at least stipulate basic structural information such as element type and bond connectivity (i.e., minimally which nonhydrogen atoms are connected to one another) but may also contain some form of coordinate information. Such chemical structures may be stored and received in a number of different data representations. One common example of data representation, though many others are also possible, is that of a PDB file. Examples of currently available software programs that can be used to assign chemical descriptors include SYBYL\u2122 from Tripos, Chimera\u2122 from UCSF, and WhatIf\u2032 (for proteins), etc. Correct assignment of chemical descriptors may also include additional input regarding chiral centers and stereochemistry or even environmental factors, such as expected pH as related to assignment of ionization states.",
                                "The term \u201caffinity formulation\u201d and the related term refer to the energy model used to calculate approximate quantitative values for a given interaction type for a configuration associated with a molecular combination. Typically, there may be many different affinity formulations for a given interaction type from which to choose. The choice of affinity formulation may affect the amount of error associated with the quantitative approximation of a given interaction type. The choice of affinity formulation may also involve very different levels of modeling sophistication and hence computational complexity. A given affinity formulation may require one or more molecular descriptors for evaluation. Two different affinity formulations for a given interaction type may require a very different set of molecular descriptors, while others may share multiple molecular descriptors in common. For example, electrostatic interactions may be modeled according to an affinity formulation involving the use of a modified form of Coulomb's law with distance-dependent dielectric function as applied to a set of partial charges assigned to atomic centers in each molecular subset via use of a suitable force field. In another example, both electrostatic and electrostatic desolvation interactions may be modeled according to an affinity formulation involving a solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (linear or nonlinear) along with an assumption of point charges embedded in solute spherical cavities with size defined by van der Waal radius of each atom and the solute spheres placed in a homogeneous dielectric medium representing water with and possibly containing an ionic atmosphere. Alternatively, electrostatic interactions may be modeled based on quantum-mechanical solution of electronic ground states for each molecular subset. In most scenarios the modified Coulomb with distance-dependent dielectric formulation will be cheaper to compute but less accurate than a Poisson-Boltzmann-based formulation let alone a full quantum-mechanical solution. As further examples, van der Waals interactions may be modeled according to an affinity formulation based on use of a generalized Lennard-Jones potential or alternatively based on a steric complementarity. Hydrogen-bonding interactions may be modeled according to an affinity formulation based on use of a 12-10 Lennard-Jones potential with an angular weighting function or by rescaling of partial charges and van der Waals radii of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms such as that found in the Amber force field. The hydrophobic effect may be modeled according to an affinity formulation based on the fragmental volume approach or the solvent accessible surface area-based formalism. Intramolecular strain associated with dihedral changes may be modeled according to an affinity formulation based on use of Pitzer potentials or by inverse Gaussian torsional constraints. As yet another example, instead of using a Poisson Boltzmann-based formulation, electrostatic desolvation for a configuration may be modeled via an affinity formulation based on use of a variant of the Generalized Born approximation.",
                                "The term \u201ccomputation strategy\u201d herein refers to the computational technique used to quantitatively evaluate a given affinity formulation for one or more interaction types. The choice of computation strategy may be influenced by the available computational systems, apparatus, means and/or methods, the available memory capacity, and/or computing time constraints. As an example of different computational strategies for the same affinity formulation, consider the electrostatic interaction for target-ligand combination, for which a modified Coulombic affinity formulation with distance-dependent dielectric may be computed according to a computation strategy involving direct summation of pair-wise calculation between all possible pairs of partial charges across the protein and ligand. For a ligand with 100 atoms and a protein with 3000 atoms, this would entail the calculation of 300 K intermolecular distances let alone the number of distinct intramolecular pairs. An alternative computation strategy is to instead utilize a probe grid map approximation, whereby an electrostatic potential function associated with source charges on the protein is evaluated and stored on 3-D grid for coordinate locations enclosing the protein. Then for each ligand charge a corresponding electrostatic potential value is accessed from memory (or other storage) and the direct product of the charge and the potential is then accumulated over all charges in the ligand. This may significantly reduce computational effort especially in the context of screening a molecule library where many molecular combinations may feature the same target protein but different ligands. Of course, the probe grid map approximation may require significant storage in order to reduce numerical errors related to variation of the potential function. Moreover, such an approximation is only suitable when the source charges of the protein do not change positions between different configurations. An alternative for a target protein featuring a flexible binding pocket, may be to use a hybrid computation strategy involving the use of the pair-wise strategy for the portion of the protein containing mobile source charges and the probe grid map strategy for the remainder of the protein. In general, various different computation strategies may be applied to other affinity formulations for other interaction types. On the other hand, the choice of computation strategy may be limited by the nature of the affinity formulation or interaction type in question. For example, it is unlikely that one would a strategy appropriate for evaluation of intermolecular electrostatics interactions to instead compute intramolecular strain components involving bonded interactions. Other types of computational strategies exist than those based on pair-wise (e.g., interactions between pairs of atoms) or map or potential field (e.g., interactions of an atom with a potential field) calculations. For example, the evaluation of a Generalized Born solvation model based on the calculation of either volume integrals over the solvent excluded volume or on the calculation of surface integrals on the solvent accessible surface area. As yet another example, various formulations of bonded interactions may be evaluated according to a computation strategy featuring traversal of an appropriate data structure containing relevant coordinate and bond descriptors.",
                                "An \u201caffinity function\u201d is a composition of affinity components each of which corresponds to a combination of an interaction type, an affinity formulation, and a computation strategy. An affinity component may represent interactions for the whole or parts of one or more molecular subsets. An affinity function may contain multiple affinity components relating to the same interaction type. For example, two affinity components may represent the same interaction type but differ in either their affinity formulation and/or their computation strategy. Each distinct molecular configuration for a given molecular combination may produce different quantitative results for an affinity component and hence for the corresponding affinity function. In one embodiment, the analysis of a molecular combination may be based on determination of the configuration with the best value for the affinity function. In other embodiments, multiple favorable values for the affinity function corresponding to molecular configurations associated with one or more potential binding modes may be considered. In yet another embodiment, multiple affinity functions may be computed on one or more configurations of a molecular combination and some decision or action based on their joint consideration, such as for example the scenario of consensus scoring of a small finite number of configurations for each molecular combination explored in the course of screening a molecule library against a target molecule.",

Target validation includes determination of one or more targets that have disease relevance. Results of the target validation phase might include a determination that the presence or action of the target molecule in an organism causes or influences some effect that initiates, exacerbates, or contributes to a disease for which a cure or treatment is sought.

However, such methods are most useful where the target is simple to isolate, the ligand is simple to manufacture and the molecular interaction easily measured, but is more problematic when the target cannot be easily isolated, isolation interferes with the biological process or disease pathway, the ligand is difficult to synthesize in sufficient quantity, or where the particular target or ligand is not well characterized ahead of time.

Instead of actually combining molecules in a laboratory setting and measuring experimental results, another approach is to use computers to simulate or characterize molecular interactions between two or more molecules (i.e., molecular combinations modeled in silico).

                                "Rational drug design can use structural information about drug targets (structure-based) and/or their natural ligands (ligand-based) as a basis for the design of effective lead candidate generation and optimization. In the context of the present disclosure, PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 can serve as a drug target in the drug design process. In some cases, natural ligands PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 can serve as a basis for generating lead candidates. Structure-based rational drug design can utilize a three-dimensional model of the structure for the target. For target proteins or nucleic acids, such structures may be the result of X-ray crystallography/NMR or other measurement procedures or may result from homology modeling, analysis of protein motifs and conserved domains, and/or computational modeling of protein folding or the nucleic acid equivalent.",
                                "In the context of the present disclosure, the structure of the target can be a three-dimensional model of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 that is computationally derived (generated) from the structures of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 described in the present disclosure. For example, the three-dimensional model of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 can be computationally derived from atomic coordinates, provided elsewhere in the present disclosure, corresponding to crystals of a variant of human PD-1 comprising amino acid substitutions, such as substitutions in one or more of the residues (for example, each of the residues) corresponding to N74, T76 or A132 of SEQ ID NO:1. In some examples, in addition of a three-dimensional model of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 that is computationally derived (generated) from the structures of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 described in the present disclosure, structure-based in silico design, testing and/or optimization of human PD-1 ligands can also employ a three-dimensional model of human apo-PD-1 (meaning PD-1 without a ligand) that lacks a PD-2 binding pocket in a process that models formation of the PD-2 binding pocket and ligand-binding. The structure of a ligand may be computationally generated based on natural in vivo ligands, such as PD-1 and/or PD-2, or previously identified ligands. The ligand structure may instead be constructed ab initio from a known 2-D chemical representation using fundamental physics and chemistry principles, for example, when the ligand is not a biopolymer.",
                                "Rational drug design may incorporate the use of any of a number of computational components ranging from computational modeling of target-ligand molecular interactions and combinations to lead optimization to computational prediction of desired drug-like biological properties. The use of computational modeling in the context of rational drug design has been largely motivated by a desire both to reduce the required time and to improve the focus and efficiency of drug research and development, by avoiding often time consuming and costly efforts in biological \u201cwet\u201d lab testing and the like.",
                                "Computational modeling of target-ligand molecular combinations in the context of lead generation may involve the large-scale in silico screening of compound libraries, such as small-molecule libraries (i.e., library screening), whether the libraries are virtually generated and stored as one or more compound structural databases or constructed via combinatorial chemistry and organic synthesis, using computational methods to rank a selected subset of ligands based on computational prediction of bioactivity (or an equivalent measure) with respect to the intended target molecule.",
                                "In the context of the present disclosure, the target molecule is PD-1, and the structure of the target employed in the library screening can be a three-dimensional model of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 that is computationally derived (generated) from the structures of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 described in the present disclosure. For example, the three-dimensional model of the PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 can be computationally derived from atomic coordinates, provided elsewhere in the present disclosure, corresponding to crystals of a variant of human PD-1 comprising amino acid substitutions, such as substitutions in one or more of the residues (for example, each of the residues) corresponding to N74, T76 or A132 of SEQ ID NO:1.

                                "Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), discussed, for example, in (114) and (115), is another tool for discovering leads for drug development. FBDD first identifies starting points: low-molecular-weight ligands (\u02dc150 Da) (fragments) that bind to a target, for example, human PD-1. The fragments may bind to the target with the very low affinity. The identified fragments may be them grown or combined to produce leads with higher affinity. The three-dimensional binding mode of the fragments may be determined in silico and/or experimentally, using X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, and is used to facilitate their optimization into leads with higher activity. FBLD can be combined with screening.",
                                "Various terms and concepts are employed in computational modeling. For example, \u201cbinding mode\u201d refers to the 3-D molecular structure of a potential molecular complex in a bound state at or near a minimum of the binding energy (i.e., maximum of the binding affinity), where the term \u201cbinding energy\u201d (sometimes interchanged with \u201cbinding free energy\u201d or with its conceptually antipodal counterpart \u201cbinding affinity\u201d) refers to the change in free energy of a molecular system upon formation of a potential molecular complex, i.e., the transition from an unbound to a (potential) bound state for the ligand and target. The term \u201csystem pose\u201d is also sometimes used to refer to the binding mode. Here the term free energy generally refers to both enthalpic and entropic effects as the result of physical interactions between the constituent atoms and bonds of the molecules between themselves (i.e., both intermolecular and intramolecular interactions) and with their surrounding environment. Examples of the free energy are the Gibbs free energy encountered in the canonical or grand canonical ensembles of equilibrium statistical mechanics.",
                                "In general, the optimal binding free energy of a given target-ligand pair directly correlates to the likelihood of combination or formation of a potential molecular complex between the two molecules in chemical equilibrium, though, in truth, the binding free energy describes an ensemble of (putative) complexed structures and not one single binding mode. However, in computational modeling, it is usually assumed that the change in free energy is dominated by a single structure corresponding to a minimal energy. This is certainly true for tight binders (pK \u02dc0.1 to 10 nanomolar) but questionable for weak ones (pK \u02dc10 to 100 micromolar). The dominating structure is usually taken to be the binding mode. In some cases, it may be necessary to consider more than one alternative binding mode when the associated system states are nearly degenerate in terms of energy.",
                                "Binding affinity is of direct interest to drug discovery and rational drug design because the interaction of two molecules, such as a protein that is part of a biological process or pathway and a drug candidate sought for targeting a modification of the biological process or pathway, often helps indicate how well the drug candidate will serve its purpose. Furthermore, where the binding mode is determinable, the action of the drug on the target can be better understood. Such understanding may be useful when, for example, it is desirable to further modify one or more characteristics of the ligand so as to improve its potency (with respect to the target), binding specificity (with respect to other target biopolymers), or other chemical and metabolic properties.",
                                "When computationally modeling the nature and/or likelihood of a potential molecular combination for a given target-ligand pair, the actual computational prediction of binding mode and affinity is customarily accomplished in two parts: (a) \u201cdocking\u201d, in which the computational system attempts to predict the optimal binding mode for the ligand and the target and (b) \u201cscoring\u201d, in which the computational system attempts to refine the estimate of the binding affinity associated with the computed binding mode. During library screening, scoring may also be used to predict a relative binding affinity for one ligand vs. another ligand with respect to the target molecule and thereby rank prioritize the ligands or assign a probability for binding.",
                                "Docking may involve a search or function optimization algorithm, whether deterministic or stochastic in nature, with the intent to find one or more system poses that have favorable affinity. Scoring may involve a more refined estimation of an affinity function, where the affinity is represented in terms of a combination of one or more empirical, molecular-mechanics-based, quantum mechanics-based, or knowledge-based expressions, i.e., a scoring function. Individuals scoring functions may themselves be combined to form a more robust consensus-scoring scheme using a variety of formulations. In practice, there are many different docking strategies and scoring schemes employed in the context of today's computational drug design.",
                                "Whatever the choice of computational method there are inherent trade-offs between the computational complexity of both the underlying molecular models and the intrinsic numerical algorithms, and the amount of computing resources (time, number of CPUs, number of simulations) that must be allocated to process each molecular combination. For example, while highly sophisticated molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of the two molecules surrounded by explicit water molecules and evolved over trillions of time steps may lead to higher accuracy in modeling the potential molecular combination, the resultant computational cost (i.e., time and computing power) is so enormous that such simulations are intractable for use with more than just a few molecular combinations. On the other hand, the use of more primitive models for representing molecular interactions, in conjunction with multiple, and often error-prone, modeling shortcuts and approximations, may result in more acceptable computational cost, but will decrease modeling accuracy and predictive power.",
                                "Methods and concepts related to computational aspects of drug discovery and drug design are described in the publications summarized below. The process of high throughput docking and scoring and its applications are discussed in (46) and (49). A general approach to the design, docking, and virtual screening of multiple combinatorial libraries against a family of proteins is described in (50). The use of multiple computers to accelerate virtual screening of a large ligand library against a specific target by assigning groups of ligands to specific computers is described in (51). A number of examples of software tools are used to perform docking simulations. These methods involve a wide range of computational techniques, including use of a) rigid-body pattern-matching algorithms, either based on surface correlations, use of geometric hashing, pose clustering, or graph pattern-matching; b) fragmental-based methods, including incremental construction or \u2018place and join\u2019 operators; c) stochastic optimization methods including use of Monte Carlo, simulated annealing, or genetic (or memetic) algorithms; d) molecular dynamics simulations or e) hybrids strategies derived thereof.",
                                "The earliest docking software tool was a graph-based rigid-body pattern-matching algorithm called DOCK, developed at UCSF back in 1982 (v1.0), with more recent versions including extensions to include incremental construction. Other examples of graph-based pattern-matching algorithms are described in include CLIX (which in turn uses GRID), FLOG and LIGIN. The above and other software tools are described in (52-56). Other rigid-body pattern-matching docking software tools are described in (57-60) and include the shape-based correlation methods of FTDOCK and HEX, the geometric hashing and the pose clustering. In general, rigid-body pattern-matching algorithms assume that both the target and ligand are rigid (i.e., not flexible) and hence may be appropriate for docking small, rigid molecules (or molecular fragments) to a simple protein with a well-defined, nearly rigid active site. Thus, this class of docking tools may be suitable for de novo ligand design, combinatorial library design, or straightforward rigid-body screening of a molecule library containing multiple conformers per ligand. Incremental construction based docking software tools include FlexX (61, 62) from Tripos (licensed from EMBL), Hammerhead (63), DOCK v4.0 (as an option), and the nongreedy, backtracking algorithm of (64). Programs using incremental construction in the context of de novo ligand design include LUDI (65) (from Accelrys) and GrowMol (66_. Docking software tools also include the tools based on \u2018place and join\u2019 strategies (67).",
                                "Incremental construction algorithms may be used to model docking of flexible ligands to a rigid target molecule with a well-characterized active site. They may be used when screening a library of flexible ligands against one or more targets. They are often comparatively less compute intensive, yet consequently less accurate, than many of their stochastic optimization based competitors. Incremental construction algorithms often employ one or more scoring functions to evaluate and rank different system poses encountered during computations. For example, FlexX was extended to FlexE (68) to attempt to account for partial flexibility of the target molecule's active site via use of user-defined ensembles of certain active site rotamers. Computational docking software tools based on stochastic optimization (69) are described in (70-72) and include ICM (from MolSoft), GLIDE (from Schrodinger), and LigandFit (from Accelrys), all based on modified Monte Carlo techniques, as well as AutoDock v.2.5 (from Scripps Institute) based on simulated annealing. Other software tools based on genetic or memetic algorithms are described in (73-76) and include GOLD, DARWIN, and AutoDock v.3.0 (also from Scripps).",
                                "Stochastic optimization-based methods may be used to model docking of flexible ligands to a target molecule. They generally use a molecular-mechanics-based formulation of the affinity function and employ various strategies to search for one or more favorable system energy minima. They are often more computer intensive, yet also more robust, than their incremental construction competitors. As they are stochastic in nature, different runs or simulations may often result in different predictions. Traditionally most docking software tools using stochastic optimization assume the target to be nearly rigid (i.e., hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups in the active site may rotate), since otherwise the combinatorial complexity increases rapidly making the problem difficult to robustly solve in reasonable time.",
                                "Molecular dynamics simulations have also been used in the context of computational modeling of target-ligand combinations. This includes the implementations presented in (77) and (71) (along with Monte Carlo). In principle, molecular dynamics simulations may be able to model protein flexibility to an arbitrary degree. On the other hand, they may also require evaluation of many fine-grained, time steps and are thus often very time-consuming (one order of hours or even days per target-ligand combination). They also often require user interaction for selection of valid trajectories. Use of molecular dynamics simulations in lead discovery can be more suited to local minimization of predicted complexes featuring a small number of promising lead candidates. Hybrid methods may involve use of rigid-body pattern-matching techniques for fast screening of selected low-energy ligand conformations, followed by Monte Carlo torsional optimization of surviving poses, and finally even molecular dynamics refinement of a few choice ligand structures in combination with a (potentially) flexible protein active site. An example of this type of docking software strategy is (78).",
                                "There are a number of examples of scoring functions implemented in software and used to estimate target-ligand affinity, rank prioritize different ligands as per a library screen, or rank intermediate docking poses in order to predict binding modes. Scoring functions traditionally fall into three distinct categories: a) empirical scoring functions, b) molecular-mechanics-based expressions, or I knowledge-based scoring functions or hybrid schemes derived thereof. Empirically derived scoring functions (as applied to target-ligand combinations) were first inspired by the linear free-energy relationships often utilized in QSAR studies. An early example is that of B\u00f6hm et al. (65, 79) (used in LUDI). Other empirical scoring functions are described in (80-84) and include SCORE (used in FlexX), ChemScore, PLP, Fresno, and GlideScore v.2.0+(modified form of ChemScore, used by GLIDE).",
                                "In general, empirical scoring functions comprise the bulk of scoring functions used today, especially in the context of large compound library screening. The basic premise is to calibrate a linear combination of empirical energy models, each multiplied by an associated numerical weight and each representing one of a set of interaction components represented in a (so-called) \u2018master scoring equation\u2019, where said equation attempts to well approximate the binding free energy of a molecular combination. The numerical weight factors may be obtained by fitting to experimental binding free energy data composed for a training set of target-ligand complexes. Molecular-mechanics-based scoring functions were first developed for use in molecular modeling in the context of molecular mechanics force fields like AMBER, OPLS, MMFF, and CHARMM (described in (85-89)). Examples of molecular-mechanics-based scoring functions include both the chemical and energy-based scoring functions of DOCK v.4.0 (based on AMBER), the objective functions used in GOLD, AutoDock v.3.0 (with empirical weights), and FLOG. In general, molecular-mechanics-based scoring functions may closely resemble the objective functions utilized by many stochastic optimization-based docking programs. Such functions typically require atomic (or chemical group) level parameterization of various attributes (e.g., charge, mass, van der Waals radii, bond equilibrium constants, etc.) based on one or more molecular mechanics force fields (e.g., AMBER, MMFF, OPLS, etc.). In some cases, the relevant parameters for the ligand may also be assigned based on usage of other molecular modeling software packages, e.g., ligand partial charges assigned via use of MOPAC (90), AMPAC (91) or AMSOL (92). They may also include intramolecular interactions (i.e., self-energy of molecules), as well as long range interactions such as electrostatics. In some cases, the combination of energy terms may again be accomplished via numerical weights optimized for reproduction of test ligand-target complexes.",
                                "Knowledge-based scoring functions were first inspired by the potential of mean force statistical mechanics methods for modeling liquids. Examples include DrugScore, PMF and BLEEP (93-95). In general, knowledge-based scoring functions do not require partitioning of the affinity function. However, they do require usage of a large database of 3-D structures of relevant molecular complexes. There is also usually no need for regression against a data set of molecular complexes with known experimental binding affinities. These methods are based on the underlying assumption that the more favorable an interaction is between two atoms, at a given distance, the more frequent its occurrence relative to expectations in a bulk, disordered medium. These schemes are sometimes referred to as \u2018inverse Boltzmann\u2019 schemes, but in fact the presence of local, optimized structures in macromolecules and protein folds means that distance-dependent pair-wise preference distributions need not be strictly Boltzmann. It is also possible to introduce the concept of singlet preferences based on other molecular descriptors, e.g., solvent accessible surface area for approximation of solvation effects. Hybrid scoring functions may be a mixture of one or more scoring functions of distinct type. One example is VALIDATE (96), which is a molecular-mechanics/empirical hybrid function. Other combinations of scoring functions may include the concept of consensus scoring in which multiple functions may be evaluated for each molecular combination and some form of \u2018consensus\u2019 decision is made based on a set of rules or statistical criteria, e.g., states that occur in the top 10% rank list of each scoring function (intersection-based), states that have a high mean rank (average-based), etc. A useful review discussion of consensus scoring can be found in (97). Various file formats exist for the digital representation of structural and chemical information for both target proteins and compounds as related to structural databases. Examples include the pdb, mol2 (from Tripos), and the SMILES formats.",
                                "A discussion on the calculation of total electrostatic energies involved in the formation of a potential molecular complex can be found in (98). Computational solutions of electrostatic potentials in the classical regime range from simpler formulations, like those involving distance-dependent dielectric functions, to more complex formulations, like those involving solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (99, 100), a second order, generally nonlinear, elliptic partial differential equation. Other classical formalisms that attempt to model electrostatic desolvation include those based on the Generalized Born solvation model (101, 102), methods that involve representation of reaction field effects via additional solvent accessible or fragmental volume terms (103-105), or explicit representation of solvent in the context of molecular dynamics simulations (106-108). A lengthy review of full quantum mechanical treatment of electrostatics interactions can be found in (109).",

As shown, a configuration modeler 102 receives one or more input configuration records 106, including both the identities of and molecular descriptors for input structures for one or more molecular subsets from an input molecular combination database 104. The configuration modeler 102 comprises a configuration data transformation engine 108, an affinity calculator 109, and descriptor data storage 120. Results from the configuration modeler 102 are output as configuration results records 111 to a results database (DB) 110. Modeling system 100 may be used to determine or characterize one or more molecular combinations. In some embodiments, this may include, but is not limited to, prediction of likelihood of formation of a potential molecular complex, or a proxy thereof, the estimation of the binding affinity or binding energy between molecular subsets in an environment, the prediction of the binding mode (or even additional alternative modes) for the molecular combination, or the rank prioritization of a collection of molecular subsets (e.g., ligands) based on predicted bioactivity with a target molecular subset, and would therefore also include usage associated with computational target-ligand docking and scoring.",
                                "In a typical operation, many molecular combinations, each featuring many different molecular configurations, may be modeled. Since the total possible number of configurations may be enormous, the modeling system may sample a subset of configurations during the modeling procedure, though the sampling subset may still be very large (e.g., millions or billions of configurations per combination) and the selection strategy for configuration sampling is specified by one or more search and/or optimization techniques (e.g., steepest descent, conjugate gradient, modified Newton's methods, Monte Carlo, simulated annealing, genetic or memetic algorithms, brute force sampling, pattern matching, incremental construction, fragment place-and-join, etc.). An affinity function is evaluated for each visited configuration and the results for one or more configurations recorded in a storage medium.",

In another embodiment, the transformation of molecular configurations into newer variants may result in multiple new configurations from one configuration, such as, for example, the construction of a suitable (often randomized) initial population for use in a genetic algorithm. In some embodiments, the configuration data transformation engine 108 may be able to construct ab initio one or more entirely new configurations without the requirement of input geometrical descriptors from an input molecular combination database 104, though other types of molecular descriptors may still be needed.",
                                "As already discussed, in some embodiments, the set of configurations generated via transformation during the course of an analysis of a molecular combination may be determined according to a schedule or sampling scheme specified by one or more search and/or optimization techniques used to drive the modeling processes of the configuration modeler 102. In some embodiments, the search strategy or optimization technique may be an iterative process whereby one or more configurations are generated from one or more input configurations, then affinities are calculated for each configuration, decisions are made based on affinity and/or structure, and all or part of the new set of configurations are used as input seeds for the next iteration; the process continuing until a specified number of iterations are completed configuration modeler 102 or some other convergence criteria satisfied. In such embodiments, the input configuration records 106 obtained or derived from data in the input molecular combination database 104, may serve only to initiate (or also possibly reset) the iterative process (i.e., prime the pump). For example, in the context of the present disclosure, the input target molecular records may be based on atomic coordinates of PD-L2 binding pocket of human PD-1 included in the present disclosure, which are determined from co-crystals of a variant of human PD-1 with PD-L2 ligand. In one example, the variant of human PD-1 is a variant comprising amino acid substitutions in one or more of (such as in each) of residues corresponding to N74, T76 or A132 of SEQ ID NO:1,",
                                "In some embodiments, the search strategy or optimization technique may be stochastic in nature meaning that the set of configurations visited during analysis of a molecular combination may involve some random component and thus be possibly different between different runs of the configuration modeler 102 as applied to the same molecular combination. Here the term run refers to two different initiations of (possibly iterative) cycles of computation for analysis of the same molecular combination. In some embodiments, the combination postprocessor 116 may then base its results or decisions on configuration results records stored in database 110 but obtained from different runs. In some embodiments, the configuration data transformation engine 108 may produce new configurations sequentially, such as a new possible state associated with a given iteration of a Monte Carlo-based technique, and feed them to the affinity calculator 109 in a sequential manner. In other embodiments, the configuration data transformation engine 108 may produce multiple new configurations in parallel, such as a population associated with a given iteration of a genetic algorithm, and submit them in parallel to the affinity calculator 109. In other embodiments, the configuration data transformation engine 108 may not generate additional configurations and instead the configuration modeler 102 may operate solely on one or more input configuration records from the input molecular combination database 104, such as for example in some usages of modeling system 100 related to scoring of a set of known molecular configurations. In such embodiments, the configuration data modeler 102 may not include a search or optimization strategy and instead be used to perform affinity calculations on an enumerated set of input configuration records.",
                                "In some embodiments, various descriptor data related to the configurations of a given molecular combination may be stored or cached in one or more components of a descriptor data storage 120 via one or more storage (or memory) allocation means, structure or apparatus for efficient access and storage during the cycle of computations performed by the configuration modeler 102. In one embodiment, the descriptor data storage 120 may contain chemical or physical descriptors assigned to atoms, bonds, groups, residues, etc. in each of the molecular subsets or may even also contain environmental descriptors. In another embodiment, the descriptor data common to all configurations for a given molecular combination is compactly represented via a storage allocation means in one or more lookup tables. For example, often many physical and chemical descriptors may be identical for different configurations of a combination whereas one or more geometric descriptors are not. In yet another embodiment, the descriptor data storage 120 may also contain relevant geometric descriptors for the configurations arranged in one or more storage formats via a prescribed storage allocation means. As examples, such formats may involve, but are not limited to, records analogous to pdb or mol2 file formats. Additional examples include various data structures such as those associated with the molecular representation partitioning shown in Ahuja I. As a further example, perhaps stored descriptors for atoms and bonds may represent individual nodes in one or more lists or arrays, or may alternatively be attached, respectively, to nodes and edges of a tree or directed graph.",
                                "The whole or parts of the input configuration records 106, and, if applicable, selected configuration records 114 chosen by configuration selector 112, may be converted to data representations used in the storage allocation means of the descriptor data storage 120. Data constructs contained in the descriptor data storage 120 may be either read (i.e., accessed) for use by the configuration data transformation engine 108 or the affinity calculator 109 and may be written either at the inception of or during the execution of a cycle of computation by the configuration modeler 102. The layout and access patterns for the associated descriptor data storage 120 will likely depend on the needs of the affinity calculator 109 as well as the configuration data transformation engine 108.",
                                "The affinity calculator 109 may comprise one or more processing (i.e., affinity) engines, where each affinity engine may be dedicated to performing calculations related to one or more affinity components as defined previously in regard to interaction types, affinity formulations, and computation strategies. In some embodiments, different affinity engines are assigned to each unique affinity component. In other embodiments, one or more affinity engines may compute multiple affinity components according to similarity of processing requirements. In yet other embodiments, different affinity engines may be grouped or otherwise arranged together to take advantage of common subsets of required input data in order to improve any caching scheme and/or to reduce the number of, the bandwidth requirements for, or the routing requirements for various associated data paths.",
                                "For example, in one embodiment, affinity components for both the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions involving field-based computation strategies utilizing stored pregenerated probe grid maps, may be computed on the same affinity engine, where said engine requires access to both types of probe grid maps in storage and to various numerical parameters used in evaluating the affinity formulation for the two different interactions. As another example, affinity components for both the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions using affinity formulations featuring generalized Lennard-Jones potentials computed according to a pair-based computation strategy may be computed on the same affinity engine. In an alternative embodiment, the same two affinity components may be computed using two different affinity engines but grouped together in order to share common input data such as that relating to spatial coordinates and a subset of relevant chemical or physical descriptors."

                                "The methods related to drug design and discovery described in the present disclosure can include determining biological activity (including presence, absence or amount of biological activity, which can be also referred of \u201cefficacy,\u201d of a candidate compound or molecule (which can be, but is not limited to, a small molecule) identified and/or designed by computational (in silico) methods in an in vitro biological assay or in vivo in a subject (such as a model animal, for example, a wild-type animal, a laboratory-bred animal, or a transgenic animal model). The methods disclosed in the present disclosure can also include validating or confirming in silico predicted activities of a ligand, for example, in silico binding of the ligand to PD-1 conformation of the target protein, with the results of an in vitro biological assay, and/or with the results of an in vivo study in an animal model.",
                                "One assay in vitro platform suitable for evaluation of the ability of candidate compounds to block PD-1 interaction with its in vivo ligands is described in (116). The platform uses fluorescence-base transcriptional reporters based on the human Jurkat T cell line in conjunction with engineered T cell stimulator cell lines for investigating immune checkpoint signaling pathways, including PD-1 activity. A PD-1:PD-L2 cell-based inhibitor screening assay kit for conducting is a bioluminescent cell-based assay that can be used to screen and profile inhibitors of the PD-1:PD-L2 interaction is available from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, Calif.). In the above assay, as described in the assay data sheet, PD-1/NFAT Reporter/Jurkat T cells are used as effector cells; HEK293 cells over-expressing PD-L2 and an engineered T cell receptor (TCR) activator by transient transfection are used as target cells. When the cells are co-cultivated, TCR complexes on effector cells are activated by TCR activator on target cells, resulting in expression of the NFAT luciferase reporter. However, PD-1 and PD-L2 binding prevents TCR activation and suppresses the NFAT-responsive luciferase activity. In both scenarios, this inhibition can be specifically reversed by anti-PD-1 antibodies. This interaction also can be blocked by anti-PD-L2 antibodies. These neutralizing antibodies block PD-1 signaling and promote T cell activation, resulting in reactivation of the NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter. Another example of an in vitro assay suitable for evaluation of the ability of candidade compounds to block PD-1 interaction with its ligand in vitro is competition ELISA described in (117). As described in (117), the assay measures the amount of biotin tagged PD-1 that is able to bind to the wells coated with PD-L1. Similarly, PD-L2 can be used as an in vivo ligand. An example of an in vitro assay for testing biological activity of candidate compounds, also described in (117), is an assay testing the ability of candidate compounds to promote T cell function. As described in (117), the production of IL-2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) pre-treated with PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists (or inhibitors): neutralizing mAbs or candidate compounds before stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) for 72 hours. PBMCs include the cells that express/up-regulate both PD-1 (T cells) and PD-L1 (T cells, APCs) upon stimulation. In this assay, cytokine levels from cell culture supernatants would indicate that stimulated T cells treated with a-PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist produced significantly higher concentrations of IL-2 compared to untreated and stimulated cells, with the cells pre-treated by neutralizing mAbs serving as a positive control. Some other in vitro assays suitable for evaluating biologica activity of candidate compounds are described in (118). In one assay, PBMC from normal healthy donors are seeded at 1\u00d7105 cells/well and stimulated with SEB in the presence of candidate compounds. IL-2 secretion by PMBC is measured by ELISA on day 3 after the stimulation. In another assay, mixed lymphocyte response is assessed by co-culturing 1\u00d7105 cells CD4+ T cells with allogeneic monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) at a ratio of 10:1 (T:DC) in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates. CD4+ T cells and DC are incubated for 6 days in the presence or absence of a candidate compound. Culture supernatants are harvested on day 5 for ELISA analysis of IFN-\u03b3 secretion. One more assay measures nonspecific T cell activation. In this assay, candidate compounds are mixed with samples of heparinized fresh human whole blood to measure cytokine release. After a 4-hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the cells are pelleted, and the plasma fraction collected for measurement of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 using a cytokine cytometric bead array assay. Studies of potential anti-cancer effects of candidate compounds can also be performed in vitro in tumor-derived cell ilnes, such as D4m melanoma lines.",
                                "In vivo assays can be performed using animals, such as mice, with chemically induced or implanted tumors. Examples of in vivo assays using mouse models are described in (118). MC38 tumor cells are cultured in DMEM and implanted subcutaneously into female C57/Bl6 mice or B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J C57BL/6 mice. CT26 tumor cells are cultured in DMEM and implanted subcutaneously in female BALB/c mice. Tumor measurements are made 2-3 times weekly using an electronic caliper. Candidate compounds are administered to mice intraperitoneally on days 7, 10, and 13. For T-cell depletion studies, 500 \u03bcg of depleting antibodies for CD4 (GK1.5) or CD8 (53.6.72; BioXCell, W. Lebanon, N.H.) are administered on day 7. following subcutaneous implantation of MC38 tumor cells in the hind flank. The efficiency of CD4+ or CD8+ T cell depletion (>90%) is confirmed by FACS analysis of blood samples collected four days after administration of the depleting antibodies. Mice are sacrificed at the study termination or pre-determined endpoints. For immune response monitoring, tumors are harvested and processed using cell disruptors. The cell suspensions are clarified, pelleted, resuspended buffer or media, and counted. Cells are incubated with anti-CD16/32 mAb 24G.2 (BioXCell) to reduce background Fc\u03b3R binding and then stained with antibodies specific for CD8, CD4, and CD45. Cells are also stained with the a fixable viability. For intracellular staining (ICS), cell samples are fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies specific for FoxP3, Ki67, CTLA-4, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1 CT26 tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are identified using AH-1 MHC class I tetramers. Ex vivo AH-1 peptide stimulation is performed by culturing tumor or splenic cells with 2 \u03bcM AH-1 peptide (MBL) in the presence of brefeldin-A for 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Ex vivo cytokine staining is performed by fixing and staining cells as described above, directly after tissue harvest. Samples are analyzed on FACS flow cytometers. Cytokine assays of harvested tumor cells can also be performed using bead-bays cytokine arrays. Immunohistochemical studies of tumor sections can also be performed according to established procedures.",
                                "Any of the methods described in the present disclosure can further comprise determining the toxicity of the ligand in an in vitro, in vivo or in silico assay. As used in the present disclosure, toxicity refers to a harmful effect on a cell or organism. For example, and not to be limiting, the cardiotoxicity or neurotoxicity of a compound can be determined. In vitro methods for assessing cardiotoxicity are known in the art. For example, electrophysiology measurements can be performed in cells, including, for example single cardiac cells. The effect of one or more compounds can be assessed in cell lines that express the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG1) or in cells transfected with hERG1. The hERG safety assay from Cyprotex (Watertown, Mass.) can also be used. Cardiotoxicity can also be measured in vivo by conducting an electrocardiogram (ECG) in a subject (e.g., a wild type animal or transgenic animal) expressing hERG1 after administering the compound to the animal. In vitro cytotoxicity panels can also be used to measure toxicity in individual cells. For example, assays that measure nuclear size, mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular calcium, membrane permeability and/or cell number can be used. See, for example, the ADME-Tox panel available from EuroFins PanLabs, Inc. (Redmond, Wash.). In this assay, all five parameters are measured. Intracellular calcium and membrane permeability will increase in the presence of a cytotoxic compound. Conversely, nuclear size, cell number and mitochondrial membrane potential will decrease in the presence of a cytotoxic compound.",
                                "Genotoxicity studies can also be performed to identify mutagenic compounds. Gene mutations can be detected in bacteria, where they cause a change in growth requirements. The Ames test, which is conducted using Salmonella typhimurium is a widely used bacterial assay for the identification of compounds that can produce gene mutations, and it shows high predictive value with rodent carcinogenicity tests. Micronucleus assays can also be used to identify mutagenic compounds. Micronucleus formation is a hallmark of genotoxicity. Micronuclei are chromatin-containing bodies that represent fragments or even whole chromosomes that were not incorporated into a daughter cell nucleus at mitosis. The purpose of the assay is to detect those agents that induce chromosome damage leading to the induction of micronuclei in interphase cells. Assays that measure Cytochrome p450 (CYP) inhibition, CYP induction or drug transporter inhibition can also be performed.",
                                "Any of the methods provided in the present disclosure can further comprise determining if a candidate compound or molecule has an adverse drug reaction (ADR) or off-target effect in an in vitro, in vivo or in silico assay. It should be noted that off-target effects may be desirable or undesirable effects. In silico methods for determining off-target effects are known in the art. See, for example (110-112). In vitro assays for assessing off-target effects are also known in the art. See (113) for a review of in vitro assays that can identify undesirable off-target activity. Any of the methods provided herein can further comprise optimizing the ligand. A candidate compound or molecule can be modified or optimized for certain properties. For example, a candidate compound or molecule can be modified to reduce its toxicity, to reduce an undesirable off-target effect, to increase the binding affinity to a target protein, to decrease the binding affinity to a target protein, to increase a desirable off-target activity or to decrease an off-target activity."

                                "Substantial earlier efforts (23) to crystalize the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex were unsuccessful. Previous studies (16, 17, 19) indicated that the PD-1 ligand-binding interface comprises a hydrophobic core, the CC\u2032 loop and the FG loop, and that formation of a complex with ligands results in loop movement and pocket formation in the hydrophobic core. In the present study, it was conceived that mutations in these two loops of PD-1 were coupled to pocket formation and may alter the affinity for PD-L2. It was then experimentally confirmed that poly-glycine mutants of these loops in human PD-1 significantly decreased its affinities for PD-L2 (data not shown). The binding of sensor-loaded PD-1, the glycine-loop-mutants and the pocket mutant to 1.9 \u03bcM PD-L2 (left) and 17 \u03bcM PD-L1 (right) was measured using biolayer interferometry. Corresponding PD-1-Fc proteins were loaded onto anti-human IgG Fc capture (AHC) biosensors. Association was monitored for 2 min and dissociation for 2 min. Since the present study was particularly interested in the structure of the PD-1 pocket when bound to PD-L2, the residues in the hydrophobic core were maintained, and directed evolution was performed exclusively in the CC\u2032 loop (residues 70-78) and the FG loop (residues 127-133) of human PD-1. Deep mutational scanning (24, 27) was used to construct loop-variant libraries with trinucleotides encoding each of 20 residues at each position. Next, yeast-surface display (25) was used with a recombinant human PD-L2-human Fc fusion protein as the selection agent. After two rounds of selection using magnetic- and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (MACS and FACS), human PD-1 loop-variant clones with single-residue substitutions were isolated (data not shown). Substitutions at two residues were identified in the CC\u2032 loop (N74G and T76P), and at one residue in the FG loop (A132V, A132L). In contrast, when the same yeast library was used for section with PD-L1-Fc, only the A132 substitutions were isolated as high-affinity variants (data not shown). This result suggested that the N74G and T76P variants were PD-L2-binding specific. PD-1T76P was chosen as a template to generate a second PD-1 loop variant library and selected for further enhancement of PD-L2 binding. As a result, a PD-1 triple mutant was obtained, which contained all three substitutions identified from the first library, N74G, T76P and A132V."

Using bio-layer interferometry (BLI), the binding of PD-L2 to wild-type PD-1 and the variants was compared (data not shown). The binding of sensor-loaded PD-1 and the loop variants to 190 nM PD-L2 and 1.1 \u03bcM PD-L1 was measured using biolayer interferometry. Corresponding PD-1-Fc proteins were loaded on anti-human IgG Fc capture (AHC) biosensors. Association was monitored for 2 min and dissociation for 2 min. Fitting of binding curves was performed in Graphpad Prism 8 software using built-in equations of \u201cReceptor binding\u2014kinetics\u201d models. Means and standard deviations were calculated from 3-4 independent experiments. Wild-type PD-1 bound PD-L2 with a KD of 500 nM. The variants all exhibited increased PD-L2 affinity, with KD of 170 nM for N74G, 12 nM for T76P, and 69 nM for A132V. Remarkably, the PD-1 triple mutant had a KD of 2.6 nM, exhibiting a \u02dc200-fold increase in PD-L2 binding affinity. Table 3 summarizes the binding affinity (KD) and kinetic parameters (association constant kon, dissociation constant koff) for the PD-1 loop variants binding to PD-L2 or PD-L1. Fitting of binding curves was performed in Graphpad Prism 8 using built-in equations of \u201cReceptor binding\u2014kinetics\u201d models. Means and standard deviations were calculated from 3-4 independent experiments. The triple-mutant also showed substantially increased affinity for PD-L1. The A132V mutant showed increased affinity for PD-L1, consistent with previous reports (19, 23, 28, 29), but the N74G and T76P single mutants had minor effects. Thus, a human PD-1 triple-mutant exhibited potent binding affinity enhancement for both PD-L1 and PD-L2. Kinetic measurements of binding of the ligands by PD-1 with BLI also permitted the determination of association constants (kon). Compared to wild-type PD-1, all loop variants showed increased kon for binding PD-L2. The PD-1 triple mutant showed a 3-fold increase of kon for PD-L2, and 14-fold for PD-L1. These results suggested that these amino acid substitutions in the loops stabilized the ligand-bound state among the conformational ensembles of apo-PD-1 (17, 19)."

Co-expression of the PD-1 triple mutant and the PD-L2 IgV domain yielded a stable and 1:1 stoichiometric complex, which was purified. The crystals of the human PD-1N74G T76P A132V/PD-L2IgV complex were successfully obtained, and a 2.0 \u212b resolution structure of the complex by X-ray crystallography was determined.

The crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2.

In the interface, notable interacting residues included the three highly conserved aromatics W110L2, Y112L2 and Y114L2 from PG of the PD-L2 IgV domain. The sidechains of these residues pointed into the center of the PD-1 ligand-binding surface, as illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B. To validate the interactions observed at the PD-1/PD-L2 interface, site-directed mutagenesis on several PD-1 and PD-L2 interfacial residues was performed. Using BLI, reduced binding of PD-1 interface mutants to PD-L2, and PD-L2 interface mutants to PD-1 was observed. The observed reduced binding was consistent with the structure of human PD-1/PD-L2 complex. The high-affinity loop substitutions of PD-1 localized to the interface, as illustrated in FIG. 1B. Among them, T76P and A132V made additional contacts to PD-L2, likely contributing to the increase in affinity, as illustrated in FIG. 5."

                                "The structures of the human PD-1/PD-L2 complex and apo-PD-1 variants described in the present disclosure permitted the examination of formation of human PD-1 pocket in the PD-1/PD-L2 interface. Although human apo-PD-1 has a flat ligand-binding interface, as illustrated in FIG. 2A, the structures described in the present disclosure revealed that there were rearrangements in this interface upon binding of PD-L2. These rearrangements involved residues in \u03b2C (F63, V64, N66, Y68), \u03b2F (L122, G124, I126), \u03b2G (I134, E136) and the C\u2032D loop (E84) forming a deep and extended pocket (illustrated in FIG. 2B), accommodating PD-L2 sidechains including the aromatic residues W110L2 and Y112L2, as illustrated in FIG. 2C. Each of these residues in PD-1 is within 4.4 \u212b of a PD-L2 residue (Table 5).",
                                "Comparison of the PD-1 pockets in the human and murine PD-1/PD-L2 complexes demonstrated striking differences in pocket geometries. Human PD-1 pocket adopted an open, funnel-shaped architecture. Compared to murine PD-1 pocket, human PD-1 pocket has a wider entrance and a narrower exit (illustrated in FIG. 2B). The structured described in the present disclosure revealed that distinct pocket geometries arise from at least two considerations. First, human PD-1 was revealed to employ a different subset of interfacial residues to form the pocket, as compared to murine PD-1. Human PD-1 lacks an ordered PC\u2033 strand, and thus the open pocket in human PD-1 is formed by rearranging residues F63, V64 and E84. In contrast, murine PD-1 pocket is closed with sidechains of A81 and S83 forming a boundary. Second, several sequence variations exist among the residues that form the pocket. For example, V64 and Y68 in human PD-1 are substituted with M64 and N68 in murine PD-1, respectively. To quantitatively evaluate the pocket dimensions, pocket volumes were measured using POCASA 1.1 (34). Human and murine PD-1 pockets were measured to have volumes of 130 \u212b3 and 154 \u212b3, respectively. Notably, these pockets were comparable in size to other protein cavities with established small-molecule inhibitors (20, 21, 35).",
                                "The structure of human PD-1/PD-L2 described in the present disclosure was compared with the previously determined human PD-1/PD-L1 structure (17). Superimposing the two structures resulted in a Ca R.M.S.D. of 1.5 \u212b for PD-1 residues. Binding PD-L1 triggered formation a much smaller cavity in human PD-1, as compared to binding of PD-L2, with the cavity having a measured volume of 40 \u212b3. PD-L1 lacks a large aromatic sidechain corresponding to W110L2, so the PD-1 rearrangement was revealed to involve only a small subset of the interfacial residues to accommodate the sidechain of Y123L1, corresponding to PD-L2 residue Y112L2. These results showed that the core of the human PD-1 interface had remarkable structural plasticity and the ability to form pockets with varied dimensions, permitting the interactions with different PD-1 ligands."

Earlier studies showed that the CC\u2032 loop underwent a substantial conformational change when human PD-1 binds PD-L1 (17, 33). This CC\u2032 loop conformational change was even larger in the human PD-1/PD-L2 structure described in the present disclosure. Strikingly, in the absence of ligands, the CC\u2032 loop conformations of the PD-1 triple and double mutants resembled that of the ligand-bound conformations. For example, a 4.8 \u212b shift was observed between the Ca of T76 and P76 in the PD-1 triple mutant of apo-PD-1. When the triple-mutant PD-1 bound PD-L2, the sidechain of P76 maintained the same conformation. An increased population of the ligand-bound conformations in the mutant apo-PD-1 proteins was consistent with increased association constants (kon) of the PD-1 variants.",

Upon binding PD-L2, a large conformational change I in the PD-1 ligand-binding interface. A three-residue shortening of \u03b2C was observed, and \u03b2C and \u03b2F moved apart to create a deep cleft. The rearrangements that I in the pocket propagated to the edge of the FG loop, resulting in a remarkable 8.2 \u212b lateral shift. The overall change was less dramatic in murine PD-1. The closed architecture of the murine pocket did not require flipping of residues E84 and F63, as seen in human PD-1, and there was no secondary structure change of \u03b2C in murine PD-1. Taken together, the results described in the present disclosure provide a structural basis for systematic rearrangements at the human PD-1 ligand-binding interface coupling pocket formation and changes in the loops of PD-1 when it binds PD-L2."
