    "title": "Sweet Taste Receptor Gene Variation and Aspartame Taste in Primates and Other Species",
    "date": "2011-03-16",
    "abstract": "Aspartame is a sweetener added to foods and beverages as a low-calorie sugar replacement. Unlike sugars, which are apparently perceived as sweet and desirable by a range of mammals, the ability to taste aspartame varies, with humans, apes, and Old World monkeys perceiving aspartame as sweet but not other primate species. To investigate whether the ability to perceive the sweetness of aspartame correlates with variations in the DNA sequence of the genes encoding sweet taste receptor proteins, T1R2 and T1R3, we sequenced these genes in 9 aspartame taster and nontaster primate species. We then compared these sequences with sequences of their orthologs in 4 other nontasters species. We identified 9 variant sites in the gene encoding T1R2 and 32 variant sites in the gene encoding T1R3 that distinguish aspartame tasters and nontasters. Molecular docking of aspartame to computer-generated models of the T1R2 + T1R3 receptor dimer suggests that species variation at a secondary, allosteric binding site in the T1R2 protein is the most likely origin of differences in perception of the sweetness of aspartame. These results identified a previously unknown site of aspartame interaction with the sweet receptor and suggest that the ability to taste aspartame might have developed during evolution to exploit a specialized food niche.",

                "The ability to perceive sweet taste is a common trait in a range of animals that probably reflects the importance of simple carbohydrates as a dietary energy source (Kare and Beauchamp 1984). However, not all compounds that taste sweet are sugars and within the last 2 centuries, researchers have discovered several nonsugar sweeteners, such as saccharin and aspartame. These sweeteners are desirable because they are potentially safer for use among people who metabolize simple sugars poorly, for example, diabetics, and among people who wish to avoid the extra calories of sugar, for example, in sweetening coffee or tea. Some of types of high-potency sweeteners are large proteins found in plants, but many were synthesized, often by accident, in the laboratory (Dubois 2008).",
                "One high-potency sweetener, aspartame, is apparently not sweet to most mammals other than humans and closely related primates (Hellekant et al. 1980(Hellekant et al. , 1981(Hellekant et al. , 1994;;Naim et al. 1982;Sclafani and Abrams 1986;Thomsen et al. 1988;Glaser et al. 1992;De Francisco and Dess 1998;Bachmanov, Tordoff, and Beauchamp 2001;Schilling et al. 2004;Li et al. 2009). We say apparently since we do not know what an animal perceives, but we judge their ability by their behavior when offered aspartame-sweetened water to drink or food to eat. The differences among species in their behavior toward aspartame correspond to differences in afferent sensory responses of the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal gustatory nerves. For example, aspartame does not elicit gustatory neural responses in the aspartame nontaster species: mice (Inoue et al. 2001), gerbils (Jakinovich 1981), hamsters (Nowlis et al. 1980;Hellekant and Danilova 1996;Danilova, Hellekant, Tinti, and Nofre 1998), rats (Hellekant and Walters 1993), cows, (Hard af Segerstad andHellekant 1989a, 1989b;Hellekant et al. 2010), pigs (Hellekant and Danilova 1996;Glaser et al. 2000), prosimians and New World simians (Hellekant et al. 1980(Hellekant et al. , 1981(Hellekant et al. , 1993;;Glaser et al. 1995;Nofre et al. 1996;Danilova et al. 2002). However, in Old World monkeys and apes, aspartame evokes both behavioral preference and responses in gustatory nerves (Sato et al. 1977;Glaser et al. 1992Glaser et al. , 1995Glaser et al. , 1996;;Hellekant and Danilova 1996;Hellekant et al. 1996). The term aspartame ''taster'' and ''nontaster'' is used here to distinguish between species that prefer aspartame-flavored food or water to plain food or plain water or which have a vigorous taste nerve response to aspartame and those that do not. This term is adopted for simplicity but not all members of a species are necessarily the same in their behavioral response to aspartame. For instance, some mice prefer aspartame to water (Meliska et al. 1995;Bachmanov, Tordoff, and Beauchamp 2001). Likewise, there are exceptions to the observation that only humans and closely related primates prefer aspartame, for instance one species related to the raccoon is an aspartame taster (Li et al. 2009), as are fruit flies (Gordesky-Gold et al. 2008). These observations notwithstanding, the main point is that most mammals except for humans and Old World primates are indifferent to aspartame. The explanation for the species difference is unknown.",
                "Recent advancements in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of taste perception allowed us to form a hypothesis. Differences in taste perception among species, strains, or even among members of a population are often due to variant sites in specific receptor genes (Chandrashekar et al. 2000;Bachmanov, Li, et al. 2001;Kitagawa et al. 2001;Max et al. 2001;Montmayeur et al. 2001;Sainz et al. 2001;Jordt and Julius 2002;Kim et al. 2003;Reed et al. 2004;Bufe et al. 2005;Reed et al. 2010). Therefore, to understand species differences in aspartame sensitivity, we focused on the known sweet receptor, a heterodimer of 2 proteins, T1R2 and T1R3 (Max et al. 2001;Nelson et al. 2001Nelson et al. , 2002;;Li et al. 2002;Ariyasu et al. 2003;Damak et al. 2003;Zhao et al. 2003). From cell-based assays, we have learned that the human receptor (as opposed to the mouse receptor) is required for aspartame responsiveness (Xu et al. 2004).",
                "Introduction of the human receptor into a mouse or cell line humanizes its response to aspartame (Jiang et al. 2004;Xu et al. 2004). The preponderance of the evidence indicates that the logical first step toward understanding aspartame sensitivity would be to examine the T1R2 + T1R3 dimer, but we acknowledge that T1R homodimers or unknown heterodimers may comprise an alternative aspartame receptor in some species.",
                "These lines of evidence led us to formulate the hypothesis that disparate aspartame taste responses among primates and other species might be due to species variation in sequences of orthologs of the known sweet receptor genes. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced genes encoding T1R2 and T1R3 in 9 aspartame taster and nontaster primate species. We then compared these sequences with sequences of their orthologs in 4 other nontasters species and determined which of these differences were liable to disrupt the interaction of the sweet receptor to aspartame using computer-assisted modeling. Our goal was to identify the most likely DNA variant sites within the sweet receptor that account for aspartame sensitivity."

We included 4 additional nonprimate species because their responses to aspartame were known from previous studies and also because full-length sequences of the sweet taste receptor genes were available. Cats were eliminated from consideration because their aspartame insensitivity extends to all sweeteners tested (Li et al. 2005).",

Because mouse and human genes have the same intron-exon structure, we assumed that the primate gene structure would be the same as human too. We confirmed this assumption by sequencing the cDNA from one primate species, with the method as follows: we collected circumvallate and foliate papillae from a postmortem tongue tissue sample taken from a female Baboon (Papio anubis). We extracted total RNA from the taste papillae by using TRIZOL reagent (Invitro-gen), total RNA was transcribed to cDNA using Superscript III kit (Invitrogen), and reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using intron-spanning primers designed using baboon genomic sequences of Tas1r2 and Tas1r3.

After we obtained DNA sequences of the coding regions by PCR, we translated the DNA sequences into protein sequences based on the exon-intron junctions of human Tas1r2 and Tas1r3. The nucleotide and predicted protein sequences were aligned to detect nucleic acid and amino acid variants among the species using the ClustalW program (Thompson et al. 1994) (version 1.82; see Electronic Resources). The accession numbers for the primate sequences that we have obtained and deposited are as follows: Chimpanzee, DQ386295 (Tas1r2) and AF545573 (Tas1r3); Gorilla, DQ386296 (Tas1r2) and AF545574 (Tas1r3); Orangutan, DQ386297 (Tas1r2) and DQ381398 (Tas1r3); Patas monkey, DQ386299 (Tas1r2); Baboon, DQ386300 (Tas1r2) and DQ381400 (Tas1r3); Rhesus monkey, DQ386298 (Tas1r2); Squirrel monkey, DQ386301 (Tas1r2) and DQ381399 (Tas1r3); Marmoset, DQ386302 (Tas1r2) and DQ381401 (Tas1r3); and Tamarin, DQ386303 (Tas1r2). The sequences for nonprimate Tas1r3 and Tas1r2 and for rhesus monkey Tas1r3 were obtained from public domain. For some species (e.g., patas monkey), full-length DNA sequences could not be obtained after multiple rounds of primer design and PCR amplification. Consistent with the greater nucleotide diversity of Tas1r3 when compared with Tas1r2, the PCR using Tas1r3-specific primers were more likely to fail. Therefore, complete or nearly complete sequence for the Tas1r2 gene was obtained for most of the species studied, but Tas1r3 sequences for patas monkey and tamarin were not determined. Sequence variants that distinguished taster and nontaster species were identified after sequence alignment. Some areas of the genome of several species were difficult to sequence, and therefore, the data for some species are incomplete. There were no systematic difficulties sequencing particular areas, for example, in no cases was one region of the gene missing DNA sequence in many or all the species tested here. The final list included amino acid locations for which no taster species shared the same amino acids with any nontaster species.",

Structures were constructed for the human (aspartame taster) and mouse (aspartame nontaster) sequences. The experimentally determined structure of the rat metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (rMGR1) in its glutamate-bound (active) conformation (Protein Data Bank [code 1EWK]) was selected as a template. The taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 belong to the same class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as MGR1 and are expected to share their 3D structure. There are several structures available for MGR1 (Kunishima et al. 2000) in 2 free forms (1EWT at pH 8.5 and 1EWV at pH 7.5), bound to an antagonist (1ISS) and bound to its endogenous agonist glutamate (1EWK  (Thompson et al. 1997) was used to generate the alignments between T1Rs and the template (rMGR1) sequence. The template sequence was aligned to each T1R alignment (Figures 1 and2), which was kept unchanged during the process. This procedure is referred to as ''profile alignment'' in ClustalX. The inclusion of T1R sequences other than the ones being modeled increases the quality of the alignment and, hence, the accuracy of the modeled structure. The secondary structures for the template (actual) and for the human T1R (predicted) were used to set structure-dependent gap penalties. The T1R2 alignment was adjusted at region H318-G334 (hT1R2). This segment was originally aligned to a region of the template lying on the surface of the receptor and would have caused a beta-strand in the template, which is part of a 5-strand beta sheet, to be absent in the model for hT1R2. Therefore, the sequence alignment was adjusted to have the H318-G334 (hT1R2) segment aligned to the beta-strand instead, under the assumption that secondary structure elements are more conserved than unstructured regions on the surface. Model building began by copying the backbone coordinates of equivalent residues from the template onto the model structure. Loops not found in the template structure were added by fragment selection using a library of fragments from known 3D structures of proteins. Insertions/deletions in the modeled structure were regularized through localized energy minimization. Side chains were added using an iterative",

                        "HierVLS is a computational protocol that performs a series of steps in order to simulate the molecular docking of each ligand in the virtual library into a potential binding site of the target protein. HierVLS uses a hierarchical scheme that reduces the number of protein-ligand conformers being evaluated from thousands to one in multiple levels of accuracy. The ligands are fully flexible (i.e., all rotatable bonds are allowed to change during docking), and a large number (>10 000) of conformers are generated in the least computationally expensive step for each ligand. Subsequent steps reduce the number of docked conformers, whereas increasing the accuracy of the energy functions used to evaluate binding. ScanHierDock extends the molecular docking to include all potential binding sites within the protein and includes an additional step of all-atoms energy minimization for every ligand-protein complex generated, before the binding energies are calculated. Molecular docking of tastants to binding sites other than the assumed active (orthosteric) site allows the identification of putative allosteric sites. For T1R2 and T1R3, we refer as ''active'' or ''orthosteric'' to the site corresponding to where glutamate is found to be bound in the crystallographic structure of the closely related MGR1. This is consistent with current use of the term in the literature (Wellendorph et al. 2009). Binding energies were estimated for the predicted complexes using the Dreiding force field (Mayo et al. 1990), Gasteiger (Gasteiger and Marsili 1980) charges for the ligands, and CHARMM22 (MacKerell et al. 1998) charges for the proteins. The final binding energies include solvation energies calculated using a Generalized Born implicit solvent model (Zamanakos 2002). We used ScanHierDock to perform binding site scanning with hierarchical molecular docking in all T1R models (T1R2 and T1R3, each in active-close and activeopen conformation, for each human and mouse, to a total of 8 modeled structures). Calculated binding energies for the decoy ligands were used to assess whether values could be compared across binding sites within the same model and to determine threshold values to discriminate binders from nonbinders. These results are presented in Table 2 andFigure 3. Calculated binding energies and ligand-bound complexes for the sweet ligands were examined carefully for significance (Table 3) and consistency with experimental data from literature (in Table 4). The aspartame-bound models deemed to be the best representations of the T1R taste receptors bound to aspartame were analyzed to provide insights for the observed inability of mice to respond to this sweetener."

Results of alignments of T1R2 and T1R3 sequences show that these 2 proteins are conserved among species, and the degree of conservation reflects their known phylogenetic relationship, that is, humans and chimpanzees are much more similar in amino acid sequence than are humans and mice. For nucleotide similarity, the Tas1r3 gene was almost always less conserved compared with the Tas1r2 gene, but this relationship was not true for amino acid similarity. For amino acids, both proteins had approximately the same degree of similarity. This finding is illustrated by comparing chimpanzee and mouse: the percent identity between nucleotides (73%) and amino acids (73%) is the same for T1R3, but for T1R2, the percent identity in amino acid sequence (70%) is lower than in nucleotide sequence (78%)."

Variant sites associations were broadly defined to include any pattern of differences when none of the variant Sweet Taste Rreceptor Gene Variation and Aspartame Blindness 459 sites found among taster species were present in any nontaster species. This strategy was adopted because we did not know whether there is a single variant site that determines binding to aspartame or multiple interacting sites in the receptor, and whether acquisition of aspartame sensitivity was a single event in a common ancestor (and thus all sensitive species would have the same variant site), or there were multiple events (and then aspartame sensitivity can be due to different variants at the same site or variants at different sites). We allowed for both possibilities when assessing the amino acid variation in the receptors and therefore did not exclude locations in which one aspartame tasting species differed from another aspartame tasting species, as long as they did not share amino acids in common at that location with nontaster species. Using these criteria, we found 9 variant sites in T1R2 (Table 7) and 32 variant sites in T1R3 (Table 8). T1R3 is not more variable at the amino acid sequence level than T1R2 among all species assessed here (sequence identities range from 69% to 99% for T1R3 and from 69% to 98% for T1R2), but it makes a lopsided contribution to the variation that parses aspartame tasters from nontasters, with an approximately a 3-fold increase in the variation that separates tasters from nontasters in the T1R3 protein compared with the T1R2 protein. This observation may be an artifact from having only 2 nontaster primate species for the T1R3 protein (squirrel monkey and marmoset), whereas 4 nontaster primate species were used for comparative purposes for the T1R2 protein (patas and tamarin as well as squirrel monkey and marmoset).",
                        "Variation in the T1R3 protein is found evenly distributed across its sequence. The most common type of sequence variants associated with aspartame taster status were amino acid substitutions, but a 5 amino acid deletion at human amino acid positions 348-352 of the T1R2 protein was observed in some nontasters. The amino acids were deleted only in the nontasters but not taster primates. The other nontasters, mouse, rat, cow, and dog, did not have the deletion but do instead have amino acid substitutions that distinguish them from tasters at 2 of these 5 positions (349 and 351)."

The mean of calculated binding affinities for a set of decoy nonbinders can be used to set threshold values to identify binders. These threshold values (mean plus 2 times the standard deviation) are shown in Table 2. Ligands with calculated binding affinity at or below (more negative) these thresholds present specific binding interactions to the site and are, thus, expected to bind to the target receptor. Supporting this rationale, the calculated binding energies for natural sugars (Table 3), sucrose and dextrose, believed to bind to the VFT domain of hT1R2 and hT1R3 (Xu et al. 2004;Jiang, Cui, Zhao, et al. 2005;Nie et al. 2005;Zhang et al. 2010) are consistently below the nonbinder/binder thresholds for that site.

However, there is no consensus at the present on how one can determine when comparative analysis of calculated binding energies can be performed with reasonable confidence. In our analysis, we compare calculated binding affinities for the same ligand bound with different sites within the same target protein in different structural conformations. It is reasonable to assume that these energies can be compared since they are calculated for equivalent systems (same atoms, different coordinates). Moreover, the means of binding energies for the decoy ligands across multiple binding sites and multiple conformations of the receptors are within standard deviation of each other (Figure 3), consistent with the nonspecific nature of the intermolecular interactions that generated them. The means of binding energies for natural sugars are consistently lower than for decoys, which reflect the higher specificity of these ligands for the receptors (Table 3, Figure 3). These observations increase confidence in the validity of the comparative analysis of binding energies we present below. A caveat, however, is that although force-field-based binding energies can be used to rank ligands according to their affinity for the target protein, their absolute values are not expected to correspond to experimental binding constants (Ferrari et al. 2007;Grigoriev et al. 2007). This is mostly due to intrinsic exclusion of entropic contributions (Gilson and Zhou 2007;Hnizdo et al. 2008;Irudayam and Henchman 2009), which vary with the nature of the ligand.

For human, aspartame binding in the putative allosteric site is less favorable than binding to the active site in the active-close conformation. In contrast, this site in mouse T1R2 in the active-close conformation is as favorable for binding as the ac-tive site (Table 3). The residues comprising this allosteric site are: F27, L41, H42, K60, E61, Y62, E63, Y69, E340, W341, R352, T353, S354, Q355, and S356 (positions relative to human sequence; Table 10). The same residues are found to be involved in binding in independent analysis of mT1R2ligand complex structures. The positions comprising the putative allosteric site are well conserved among aspartame tasters, except for E340, which is V for palas monkey, baboon, and rhesus monkey, and W341, which is an R for half of the tasters. Interestingly, sequence variability is observed among nontasters for most of these positions. Mutation of E63 to K in human T1R2 was found experimentally to reduce aspartame response (Jiang, Cui, Ji, et al. 2005), which supports the idea that binding to this putative allosteric site is critical for response.

The fact that positions E302 in the active site and E63 in the allosteric site predicted in our molecular docking analyses were found to abolish or reduce aspartame response experimentally (Jiang et al. 2004;Xu et al. 2004) supports the idea that both sites play a role in aspartameinduced activation of the receptor.

In other words, Tas1r3 varies more among species at the nucleotide level but these differences are not translated into a more variable T1R3 protein. This observation is consistent with other types of analysis which suggests that the Tas1r3 gene has been subject to more purifying selection than the Tas1r2 gene (Shi and Zhang 2006), which should result in de novo mutations in the Tas1r3 gene to be more often eliminated by natural selection than for the Tas1r2 gene.

We identified 41 variant sites that differed among aspartame tasters and nontasters within the 2 sweet receptor genes, any one of which could potentially account for differential response to aspartame. Based upon the modeling work, however, the 5 amino acid segment P348-R352 in T1R2 is the most likely to be responsible for species differences in aspartame taste response. This variation is part of a putative allosteric binding site for aspartame that may compete for binding against the active site in nontaster species that preserve this segment (cow, dog, rat, and mouse). For nontasters with a deletion of this segment, the lack of this allosteric site may prevent the conformational changes which are necessary for dimerization and/or activation of the receptor by aspartame. Our hypothesis is, thus, that binding of aspartame to this allosteric site is a necessary step in receptor activation, but too much affinity for this site will halt the activation process. Other variant sites that may play an important role in aspartame response are I67 (hT1R2) at the entry of the flytrap and the pair V175 (hT1R2)-A176(hT1R3) at the interaction interface of the putative hT1R2/hT1R3 dimer. Their structural positioning suggests that I67 (hT1R2) is involved in the movement of aspartame from the allosteric to the active site, whereas V175 (hT1R2)-A176 (hT1R3) is important for dimer stability.",

The segment P348-R352 (hT1R2) (shown in green ribbon), which is a deletion in most aspartame nontasters and it is replaced with PMPNE in mouse from PPLSR in human T1R2, is key to the spatial arrangement of the putative allosteric site (its center is shown as a black sphere). Taster/nontaster variant sites V175 (hT1R2) and A176 (hT1R3) are found at the interaction interface between hT1R2 and hT1R3. These amino acids are replaced with R and D, respectively, in the mouse receptors. The introduction of charge interactions and steric effects due to the larger side chains at these positions may affect dimerization and/or activation after dimerization.",
                "aspartame binds preferentially and with strong affinity to the active site in human and mouse T1R3. For T1R2, however, a secondary site seems to be energetically favorable for aspartame binding, in addition to the putative active site. For mouse, an aspartame nontaster, the allosteric site is as favorable for binding as the active site in both active-close and active-open conformations. For human T1R2, the allosteric site is preferable in the active-open conformation, whereas the active site is better for binding in the activeclose conformation. The fact that many nontasters have a P348-R352 (hT1R2) deletion within this putative allosteric site further supports its involvement in sweet taste response to aspartame. Although there is no evidence for an activation mechanism that combines both sites, we can speculate that aspartame first binds to the allosteric site, inducing conformational changes that make binding to the active site more favorable. The binding of aspartame to the active site then induces activation and response. Whether aspartame migrates from one site to the other or 2 molecules are required for activation are among the questions that require further investigation into this proposed mechanism.",
                "Regardless of the particular mechanism, our variant analysis combined with modeling studies and supported by experimental mutation data suggests that aspartame may act as an allosteric regulator of taste response medi-ated by T1R2, in addition to the more traditional role of agonist for both T1R2 and T1R3. Allosteric regulation of GPCRs by physiologically relevant ions and small organic molecules has been observed for many GPCRs (May and Christopoulos 2003;Liu et al. 2005;Pin et al. 2005;Winnig et al. 2006;Springael et al. 2007;Conn et al. 2009;Servant et al. 2010).",
                "The curious case of the fruit fly and the lesser panda One relative of the raccoon, the lesser panda, strongly prefers aspartame (Li et al. 2009) yet does not have the signature sequence of T1R2 of the aspartame tasters species. Similarly, fruit flies have a different types of taste receptors altogether compared with mammals, also strongly prefer aspartame compared with water (Gordesky-Gold et al. 2008). There are at least 2 explanations for these observations: 1) to these species, aspartame may have a pleasant taste which is not sweet, for example, the di-peptide combination may be savory; alternatively, the ability of these species to taste and prefer aspartame may be an example of convergent evolution, in which the phenotype is the same but the mechanism supporting it differs. The motivating force for convergent evolution may be that some foods eaten by these species have compounds with a structural similarity to aspartame. Amino acids involved in binding that are identical in mouse and human T1R2 were omitted for clarity. Amino acids E340 and S356 (V and R, respectively, in mouse) are not visible because they are behind the aspartame molecules in this view. Amino acid E63 was found experimentally to reduce aspartame response (see Table 11). E63K (hT1R2) reduces but does not abolish response to aspartame, which is consistent with our proposed model of an allosteric binding site in addition to the active site at the center of the VFT. One of the taster/nontaster variant sites we have identified in hT1R2, R352, is predicted to be directly involved in binding of aspartame into the putative allosteric site. This taster/nontaster variant site corresponds to E356 in mT1R2, which contributes to the difference in geometry and orientation of aspartame into the site, as seen in the picture, and leads to stronger binding of aspartame to the mouse site compared with human.",
                "chemically diverse compounds. On the other hand, if aspartame or a structurally similar chemical is found in nature, it is possible that the primate T1R receptor evolved to respond to this compound. Primates that could taste this hypothetical, naturally-occurring aspartame-mimetic compound might have a larger food repertoire and therefore an advantage over nontaster primates. Chemicals like aspartame may exist in edible plants."

                        "There is a demand for new high-potency sweeteners with improved characteristics. Many consumers complain about after-taste characteristics or worry about negative health consequences of aspartame consumption, even though recent studies show no association between aspartame intake and cancer risks (Weihrauch and Diehl 2004;Gallus et al. 2007;Bosetti et al. 2009). Finding alternatives to aspartame with improved temporal profiles of taste activation or increased potency (i.e., achieving the same sweetness with a lesser amount) might allay some consumer concerns. Modifications in the structure of aspartame guided by structure-activity relationship studies successfully led to the discovery of neotame, a more potent analog of aspartame (Nofre and Tinti 2000). Findings of this study could guide design of novel sweeteners by modifying the structure of aspartame to take advantage of unsatisfied intermolecular interactions within the binding pocket. We might also use information about the interaction of aspartame with the primate sweet receptor to find naturally occurring plant or animal compounds that have aspartame-like structural characteristics. The discovery and development of a natural source of aspartame might also reduce consumer health concerns."

Here, we determined that the specific protein variant sites most likely to be responsible for aspartame tasting in mammals are within a putative allosteric binding site. Previous efforts to develop new sweeteners based on aspartames structure have been successful (Nofre and Tinti 2000), and the identification of this allosteric site provides a complementary method for the design of novel sweeteners and sweet taste enhancers."

We assume that animals perceive aspartame as sweet when they prefer it to water but they might perceive it as a different but desirable quality, like salty or savory. Therefore, nerve recordings are useful as objective measures because the pattern of firing to aspartame can be compared with sugars like sucrose, but this type of data is not available for all species. Conditioned taste aversion generalization data are another way to try to understand how animals perceive taste quality (Danilova, Hellekant, Tinti, and Nofre 1998). The combina-tion of different types of data would be a more ideal method to chose aspartame taster species because our reliance upon behavioral data alone could be misleading, as it was in the case of the effect of gymnemic acid in the chimpanzee (Hellekant et al. 1996;Hellekant, Ninomiya, andDanilova 1997, 1998)."
