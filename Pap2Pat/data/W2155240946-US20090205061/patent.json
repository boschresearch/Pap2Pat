                        "The sense of taste is important for determining food choice, for regulating food intake, and for ensuring efficient use of ingested nutrients. Taste can act as a warning system for the presence of potentially harmful foods, by, for example, the aversive sensations of sourness or bitterness, and as an attractant to potentially nutrient-rich foods, by, for example, the appealing sensations of sweetness, saltiness, and umami.",
                        "Taste stimuli are received by taste receptor cells assembled into taste buds that are located in the epithelium of taste papillae of the tongue (Kitagawa et al., Bioch. Bioph. Res. Comm., 283:236-242 (2001)). The stimuli are believed to be transduced by taste receptors at the surface of the taste receptor cells (Id.). The taste receptors encoded by the genes of a given species are reflective of that species' food choices. For example, the \u201csweet receptors\u201d of an herbivorous species are expected to be different from those of a carnivorous species, since the two consume completely different diets whose foods contain different primary stimuli. Since taste receptor specificity likely reflects food choice, it follows that receptor sequence homology among species may be as predictive or more predictive of food preferences of a given species as phylogenetic relatedness among species.",
                        "The behavior of the domestic cat (Felis catus), a carnivore, towards stimuli such as sweet carbohydrates, which it generally cannot taste, and towards L-amino acids, which it generally can taste, should be explicable by the specificity of taste receptors of other carnivores. Direct knowledge of taste receptor genes will allow insight into an animal's sensory world and may be useful for identifying modulators of the taste receptors encoded thereby to influence an animal's taste preferences.",
                        "Molecular receptors for the taste element of sweetness have been identified from human, mouse, and rat. Thus far, there are three known members of the T1R taste receptor family: T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 (Montmayeur & Matsunami, Curr. Opin. NeurobioL, 12(4):366-371 (2002)). The T1R3 receptor gene is located within the Sac locus, the primary genetic locus controlling preference for sweet-tasting stimuli in mice (Li et al., Mamm. Genome, 12(1):13-16 (2001); Li et al., Mamm. Genome, 13(1):5-19 (2002)). The human syntenic region for mouse T1R3 gene is on 1p36.33 (1162-1186 kb). The gene for T1R1 is located on human 1p36.23 (6324-6349 kb), which is \u02dc5 Mb from T1R3, and that for T1R2 is located on human 1p36.13 (18483-18729 kb), which is \u02dc12 Mb from T1R1.",
                        "Most of the T1Rs are G-protein coupled receptors with long N-terminal extracellular domains believed to be involved in ligand binding (Montmayeur & Matsunami, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 12(4):366-371 (2002)). The T1R receptors have been shown to dimerize. For example, homodimerization of T1Rs has been detected (Zhao et al., Cell, 115:255-266 (2003)). The taste receptors also heterodimerize. For example, coupling of T1R3 with T1R1 or T1R2 has been detected. In mouse, the T1R1/T1R3 heterodimer functions as a receptor for selected amino acids. The T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer functions as a receptor for stimuli considered sweet by humans. Current data indicate that the T1R3 component of the T1R dimer couples the taste receptor to cellular signal transduction processes, thereby ensuring that the stimulus-binding event is transduced to a neural signal. Thus, knowledge of the T1R receptors will lead to better understanding of species-specific reactions to sapid stimuli.",
                        "Currently, mechanisms for identifying novel taste stimuli for the domestic cat are limited, for example, to exhaustive and difficult feeding studies in which a novel ingredient is paired with a control ingredient and intake of the two are compared. Considerable time, effort, and expense can be expended in the discovery of a single stimulus. Furthermore, feline illnesses often are exacerbated by a cat's refusal to eat. Additionally, the molecular features that define acceptable taste stimuli for domestic cat remain largely unknown, making rational computational design approaches for taste stimuli difficult. As a result, knowledge of the feline taste receptor and its ligands may lead to a better understanding of cat taste perception and modulation thereof.",
                        "The present invention provides novel genes encoding the feline taste receptors T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3, the polypeptides encoded thereby, and methods of use of the receptors to identify compounds that can stimulate, inhibit, or modify the ingestive responses or general behavior of a cat. The screening methods of the invention allow the rapid screening of binding partners, agonists, antagonists, and modulators of the T1R receptors of the domestic cat. The results of the feline T1R receptor studies reflect the unique taste profile of the domestic cat."

A \u201csynthesized polynucleotide\u201d as used herein refers to polynucleotides produced by purely chemical, as opposed to enzymatic, methods. \u201cWholly\u201d synthesized DNA sequences are therefore produced entirely by chemical means, and \u201cpartially\u201d synthesized DNAs embrace those wherein only portions of the resulting DNA were produced by chemical means. The polynucleotides of the invention may be single- or double-stranded. The polynucleotides of the invention may be chemically modified and may contain non-natural or derivatized nucleotide bases as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. Such modifications include, for example, labels, methylation, substitution of one or more nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, etc.), charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), pendent moieties (e.g., polypeptides, etc.), intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), chelators, alkylators, and modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.).

Typically, amplification of either or both strand(s) of the target nucleic acid comprises the use of one or more nucleic acid-modifying enzymes, such as a DNA polymerase, ligase, RNA polymerase, or RNA-dependent reverse transcriptase. Examples of polynucleotide amplification include, but are not limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASB), self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), strand displacement activation (SDA), ligase chain reaction, Q\u03b2 replicase system, and the like. A wide variety of alternative cloning and in vitro amplification methodologies are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of these techniques are found in, for example, Berger et al., Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, ME152, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif. (Berger), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",

This short sequence is based on (or designed from) a genomic or cDNA sequence and is used to amplify, confirm, or reveal the presence of an identical, similar, or complementary DNA or RNA in a particular cell or tissue. Oligonucleotides comprise portions of a nucleic acid sequence having at least about 10 nucleotides and as many as about 50 nucleotides, often about 12 or 15 to about 30 nucleotides. They are chemically synthesized and may be used as probes. \u201cPrimer pair\u201d refers to a set of primers including a 5\u2032 upstream primer that hybridizes with the 5\u2032 end of a target sequence to be amplified and a 3\u2032 downstream primer that hybridizes with the complement of the 3\u2032 end of the target sequence to be amplified.",

Probes are used in the detection of identical, similar, or complementary target nucleic acid sequences, which target sequences may be single- or double-stranded. Longer probes are usually obtained from a natural or recombinant source, are highly specific, and are much slower to hybridize than oligomers, or shorter probes. They may be single- or double-stranded and are carefully designed to have specificity in PCR, hybridization membrane-based, or ELISA-like technologies. An \u201covergo probe\u201d is a DNA probe comprising two short, overlapping DNA sequences (e.g., 10-50 nucleotides each) with a complementary overlapping region (e.g., 5-15 nucleotides) that is used in an overgo hybridization strategy. For example, an overgo probe may be two 22 mers with an 8 bp complementary overlap, resulting in a 36 mer overgo probe. As another example, an overgo probe may be two 24 mers with an 8 bp complementary overlap, resulting in a 40 mer overgo probe.",
                        "As used herein, the phrase \u201cstringent hybridization conditions\u201d or \u201chigh stringency conditions\u201d refers to conditions under which a probe, primer, or oligonucleotide will hybridize to its target sequence, but to a minimal number of or no other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences will hybridize with specificity to their proper complements at higher temperatures. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target sequence hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium. Since the target sequences are generally present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are hybridized to their complements at equilibrium. Stringent temperature conditions will generally include temperatures in excess of 30\u00b0 C., typically in excess of 37\u00b0 C., and may be in excess of 45\u00b0 C. Stringent salt conditions will ordinarily be less than 1.0 M, typically less than 0.5 M, and may be less than 0.2 M. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. for short probes, primers, or oligonucleotides (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60\u00b0 C. for longer probes, primers, or oligonucleotides. Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents, such as formamide.",

Isoforms can be expressed in different tissues of the same organism as a result of, for example, alternative splicing of RNA. Alternatively, isoforms can be encoded by different genes. Homologous nucleotide sequences include nucleotide sequences encoding for a species variant of a protein. Homologous nucleotide sequences also include, but are not limited to, naturally occurring allelic variations and mutations of the nucleotide sequences set forth herein. Study of mutations and polymorphisms of the T1R receptor polynucleotide sequences may explain breed-specific and/or individual taste preferences of a mammal such as a cat. Additionally, sequence variants of the T1R receptors may be associated with specific disease states, such that knowledge of the genes allows diagnosis and treatment of T1R-associated disorders (e.g., obesity, diabetes). Homologous amino acid sequences include those amino acid sequences which encode conservative amino acid substitutions in polypeptides having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:61, or SEQ ID NO:64, as well as in polypeptides identified according to the methods of the invention. Percent homology may be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using the default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math., 2: 482-489, 1981). Nucleic acid fragments of the invention preferably have at least about 5, at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, at least about 50, or at least about 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. The nucleic acid fragments of the invention may encode a polypeptide having at least one biological property, or function, that is substantially similar to a biological property of the polypeptide encoded by the full-length nucleic acid sequence.",
                        "As is well known in the art, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, there are numerous DNA and RNA molecules that can code for the same polypeptide as that encoded by a nucleotide sequence of interest. The present invention, therefore, contemplates those other DNA and RNA molecules which, on expression, encode a polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid molecule of interest. For example, nucleotide \u201cinsertions\u201d, \u201csubstitutions\u201d or \u201cdeletions\u201d are changes to or within a nucleotide sequence. Such polynucleotide variants are within the scope of the invention. DNA and RNA molecules other than those specifically disclosed herein characterized simply by a change in a codon for a particular amino acid, are within the scope of this invention.",

The variation allowed in a particular amino acid sequence may be experimentally determined by producing the peptide synthetically or by systematically making insertions, deletions, or substitutions of nucleotides in the nucleic acid sequence using recombinant DNA techniques. Alterations of the naturally occurring amino acid sequence can be accomplished by any of a number of known techniques. For example, mutations can be introduced into the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide at particular locations by procedures well known to the skilled artisan, such as oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis.",
                        "A polypeptide variant of the present invention may exhibit substantially the biological activity of a naturally occurring reference polypeptide. \u201cBiological activity\u201d as used herein refers to the level of a particular function (for example, enzymatic activity) of a molecule or pathway of interest in a biological system. \u201cWild-type biological activity\u201d refers to the normal level of function of a molecule or pathway of interest. \u201cReduced biological activity\u201d refers to a decreased level of function of a molecule or pathway of interest relative to a reference level of biological activity of that molecule or pathway. For example, reduced biological activity may refer to a decreased level of biological activity relative to the wild-type biological activity of a molecule or pathway of interest. \u201cIncreased biological activity\u201d refers to an increased level of function of a molecule or pathway of interest relative to a reference level of biological activity of that molecule or pathway. For example, increased biological activity may refer to an increased level of biological activity relative to the wild-type biological activity of a molecule or pathway of interest. Reference to exhibiting \u201csubstantially the biological activity of a naturally occurring polypeptide\u201d indicates that variants within the scope of the invention can comprise conservatively substituted sequences, meaning that one or more amino acid residues of a polypeptide are replaced by different residues that do not alter the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the polypeptide. Such substitutions may include the replacement of an amino acid by a residue having similar physicochemical properties, such as substituting one aliphatic residue (Ile, Val, Leu or Ala) for another, or substitution between basic residues Lys and Arg, acidic residues Glu and Asp, amide residues Gln and Asn, hydroxyl residues Ser and Tyr, or aromatic residues Phe and Tyr. Further information regarding making phenotypically silent amino acid exchanges are known in the art (Bowie et al., Science, 247: 1306-1310, 1990). Other polypeptide homologs which might retain substantially the biological activities of the reference polypeptide are those where amino acid substitutions have been made in areas outside functional regions of the protein. The biological activity may be assessed by, for example, measuring binding of a T1R receptor of the invention to a dimerization partner. Biological activity of the polypeptides of the invention also may be determined by measuring ion conductance; ion flow; calcium imaging including with fura-2, green dextran activity, or aquorin activity; voltage measurement and/or voltage imaging with dyes or reporter genes such as \u03b2-luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, \u03b2-galactosidase, or \u03b2-lactamase; second messenger measurement, for example, IP3, cAMP, G-protein activation-based assays; or receptor phosphorylation.",
                        "A nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence of a nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide employed in the invention or of a compound identified by the screening method of the invention may be used to search a nucleotide and amino acid sequence databank for regions of similarity using Gapped BLAST (Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res., 25: 3389, 1997). Briefly, the BLAST algorithm, which stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool is suitable for determining sequence similarity (Altschul et al., J Mol. Biol., 215: 403-410, 1990). Software or performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pair (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence that either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., J Mol. Biol., 215: 403-410, 1990). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Extension for the word hits in each direction are halted when: 1) the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; 2) the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or 3) the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLAST program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (Henikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89: 10915-10919, 1992) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm (Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 5873-5787, 1993) and Gapped BLAST perform a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences. One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a gene or cDNA if the smallest sum probability in comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 1, preferably less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.",

Promoter and enhancer sequences are generally selected for the ability to increase gene expression, while operator sequences are generally selected for the ability to regulate gene expression. Expression constructs of the invention may also include sequences encoding one or more selectable markers that permit identification of host cells bearing the construct. Expression constructs may also include sequences that facilitate, or promote, homologous recombination in a host cell.

The need for control sequences in the expression vector will vary depending upon the host selected and the transformation method chosen. Control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding, and sequences which control the termination of transcription and translation.",

For example, tissue can be probed in situ with oligonucleotide probes carrying detectable groups by conventional autoradiography techniques to investigate native expression of this enzyme or pathological conditions relating thereto. Antisense oligonucleotides may be directed to regulatory regions of a T1R nucleotide sequence, or mRNA corresponding thereto, including, but not limited to, the initiation codon, TATA box, enhancer sequences, and the like.",
                                "Those of skill in the art recognize that the antisense oligonucleotides that inhibit the expression and/or biological activity of a T1R receptor of the invention may be predicted using any gene encoding a T1R receptor. Specifically, antisense nucleic acid molecules comprise a sequence preferably complementary to at least about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, 250 or 500 nucleotides or an entire T1R receptor gene sequence. The antisense oligonucleotides may comprise a sequence complementary to about 15 consecutive nucleotides of the coding strand of the T1R receptor-encoding sequence.",

The coding strand may also include regulatory regions of the T1R sequence. The term \u201ccoding region\u201d refers to the region of the nucleotide sequence comprising codons which are translated into amino acid residues. In another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule is antisense to a \u201cnoncoding region\u201d of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding a T1R protein. The term \u201cnoncoding region\u201d refers to 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences which flank the coding region that are not translated into amino acids (i.e., also referred to as 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR)).",

Given the coding strand sequences provided herein, antisense nucleic acids of the invention can be designed according to the rules of Watson and Crick or Hoogsteen base pairing. The antisense nucleic acid molecule can be complementary to the entire coding region of a T1R mRNA, but also may be an oligonucleotide that is antisense to only a portion of the coding or noncoding region of the mRNA. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be complementary to the region surrounding the translation start site of an mRNA. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 nucleotides in length.",
                                "Another means to inhibit the activity of a T1R receptor according to the invention is via RNA interference (RNAi) (see e.g., Elbashir et al., Nature, 411:494-498 (2001); Elbashir et al., Genes Development, 15:188-200 (2001)). RNAi is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene (e.g., is homologous in sequence to the sequence encoding a T1R receptor, for example but not limited to the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:99, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, or SEQ ID NO:63). siRNA-mediated silencing is thought to occur post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. For example, siRNA duplexes may mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing by reconstitution of siRNA-protein complexes (siRNPs), which guide mRNA recognition and targeted cleavage.",
                                "Accordingly, another form of a T1R inhibitory compound of the invention is a short interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against a T1R-encoding sequence. Exemplary siRNAs are siRNA duplexes (for example, 10-25, preferably 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 residues in length) having a sequence homologous or identical to a fragment of the T1R sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:99, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, or SEQ ID NO:63 and having a symmetric 2-nucleotide 3\u2032-overhang. The 2-nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang may be composed of (2\u2032-deoxy) thymidine because it reduces costs of RNA synthesis and may enhance nuclease resistance of siRNAs in the cell culture medium and within transfected cells. Substitution of uridine by thymidine in the 3\u2032 overhang is also well tolerated in mammalian cells, and the sequence of the overhang appears not to contribute to target recognition."

The term \u201cspecific for,\u201d when used to describe antibodies of the invention, indicates that the variable regions of the antibodies of the invention recognize and bind T1R polypeptides, preferably exclusively (i.e., are able to distinguish T1R polypeptides of the invention from other known polypeptides by virtue of measurable differences in binding affinity, despite the possible existence of localized sequence identity, homology, or similarity between T1R and such polypeptides). It will be understood that specific antibodies may also interact with other proteins (for example, S. aureus protein A or other antibodies in ELISA techniques) through interactions with sequences outside the variable region of the antibodies, and, in particular, in the constant region of the molecule. Screening assays to determine binding specificity of an antibody of the invention are well known and routinely practiced in the art. For a comprehensive discussion of such assays, see Harlow et al. (Eds.), AA LM; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988), Chapter 6. Antibodies that recognize and bind fragments of the T1R polypeptides of the invention are also contemplated, provided that the antibodies are specific for T1R polypeptides. Antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method well known and routinely practiced in the art.",

Antibodies that can be generated from polypeptides that have previously been described in the literature and that are capable of fortuitously cross-reacting with feline T1R receptor (e.g., due to the fortuitous existence of a similar epitope in both polypeptides) are considered \u201ccross-reactive\u201d antibodies. Such cross-reactive antibodies are not antibodies that are \u201cspecific\u201d for a feline T1R receptor. The determination of whether an antibody is specific for a feline T1R receptor or is cross-reactive with another known receptor is made using any of several assays, such as Western blotting assays, that are well known in the art. For identifying cells that express a T1R receptor and also for modulating T1R-ligand binding activity, antibodies that specifically bind to an extracellular epitope of the T1R receptor may be used.",

The identified peptide is labeled with a suitable radioisotope, including, but not limited to, 125I, 3H, 35S or 32P, by methods that are well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the peptides may be labeled by well-known methods with a suitable fluorescent derivative (Baindur et al., Drug Dev. Res., 1994, 33, 373-398; Rogers, Drug Discovery Today, 1997, 2, 156-160). Radioactive ligand specifically bound to the receptor in membrane preparations made from the cell line expressing the recombinant protein can be detected in HTS assays in one of several standard ways, including filtration of the receptor-ligand complex to separate bound ligand from unbound ligand (Williams, Med. Res. Rev., 1991, 11, 147-184; Sweetnam et al., J. Natural Products, 1993, 56, 441-455). Alternative methods include a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) or a FlashPlate format in which such separation is unnecessary (Nakayama, Cur. Opinion Drug Disc. Dev., 1998, 1, 85-91; Boss\u00e9 et al., J. Biomolecular Screening, 1998, 3, 285-292.). Binding of fluorescent ligands can be detected in various ways, including fluorescence energy transfer (FRET), direct spectrophotofluorometric analysis of bound ligand, or fluorescence polarization (Rogers, Drug Discovery Today, 1997, 2, 156-160; Hill, Cur. Opinion Drug Disc. Dev., 1998, 1, 92-97).",
                                "Other assays may be used to identify specific ligands of a T1R receptor or dimer, including assays that identify ligands of the target protein through measuring direct binding of test ligands to the target, as well as assays that identify ligands of target proteins through affinity ultrafiltration with ion spray mass spectroscopy/HPLC methods or other physical and analytical methods. Alternatively, such binding interactions are evaluated indirectly using the yeast two-hybrid system described in Fields et al., Nature, 340:245-246 (1989), and Fields et al., Trends in Genetics, 10:286-292 (1994), both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The two-hybrid system is a genetic assay for detecting interactions between two proteins or polypeptides. It can be used to identify proteins that bind to a known protein of interest, or to delineate domains or residues critical for an interaction. Variations on this methodology have been developed to clone genes that encode DNA binding proteins, to identify peptides that bind to a protein, and to screen for drugs. The two-hybrid system exploits the ability of a pair of interacting proteins to bring a transcription activation domain into close proximity with a DNA binding domain that binds to an upstream activation sequence (UAS) of a reporter gene, and is generally performed in yeast. The assay requires the construction of two hybrid genes encoding (1) a DNA-binding domain that is fused to a first protein and (2) an activation domain fused to a second protein. The DNA-binding domain targets the first hybrid protein to the UAS of the reporter gene; however, because most proteins lack an activation domain, this DNA-binding hybrid protein does not activate transcription of the reporter gene. The second hybrid protein, which contains the activation domain, cannot by itself activate expression of the reporter gene because it does not bind the UAS. However, when both hybrid proteins are present, the noncovalent interaction of the first and second proteins tethers the activation domain to the UAS, activating transcription of the reporter gene. For example, when the first protein is a receptor, or fragment thereof, that is known to interact with another protein or nucleic acid, this assay can be used to detect agents that interfere with the binding interaction. Expression of the reporter gene is monitored as different test agents are added to the system. The presence of an inhibitory agent results in lack of a reporter signal.",
                                "The yeast two-hybrid assay can also be used to identify proteins that bind to the gene product. In an assay to identify proteins that bind to a T1R receptor, or fragment thereof, a fusion polynucleotide encoding both a T1R receptor (or fragment) and a UAS binding domain (i.e., a first protein) may be used. In addition, a large number of hybrid genes each encoding a different second protein fused to an activation domain are produced and screened in the assay. Typically, the second protein is encoded by one or more members of a total cDNA or genomic DNA fusion library, with each second protein-coding region being fused to the activation domain. This system is applicable to a wide variety of proteins, and it is not necessary to know the identity or function of the second binding protein. The system is highly sensitive and can detect interactions not revealed by other methods; even transient interactions may trigger transcription to produce a stable mRNA that can be repeatedly translated to yield the reporter protein.",
                                "Other assays may be used to search for agents that bind to the target protein. One such screening method to identify direct binding of test ligands to a target protein is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,277, incorporated herein by reference. This method relies on the principle that proteins generally exist as a mixture of folded and unfolded states, and continually alternate between the two states. When a test ligand binds to the folded form of a target protein (i.e., when the test ligand is a ligand of the target protein), the target protein molecule bound by the ligand remains in its folded state. Thus, the folded target protein is present to a greater extent in the presence of a test ligand which binds the target protein, than in the absence of a ligand. Binding of the ligand to the target protein can be determined by any method that distinguishes between the folded and unfolded states of the target protein. The function of the target protein need not be known in order for this assay to be performed. Virtually any agent can be assessed by this method as a test ligand, including, but not limited to, metals, polypeptides, proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, polynucleotides and small organic molecules.",
                                "Another method for identifying ligands of a target protein is described in Wieboldt et al., Anal. Chem., 69:1683-1691 (1997), incorporated herein by reference. This technique screens combinatorial libraries of 20-30 agents at a time in solution phase for binding to the target protein. Agents that bind to the target protein are separated from other library components by simple membrane washing. The specifically selected molecules that are retained on the filter are subsequently liberated from the target protein and analyzed by HPLC and pneumatically assisted electrospray (ion spray) ionization mass spectroscopy. This procedure selects library components with the greatest affinity for the target protein, and is particularly useful for small molecule libraries.",
                                "Other embodiments of the invention comprise using competitive screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the polypeptide. In this manner, the antibodies can be used to detect the presence of any peptide that shares one or more antigenic determinants with T1R receptor. Radiolabeled competitive binding studies are described in A. H. Lin et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1997, 41(10): 2127-2131, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                                "Another aspect of the present invention is directed to methods of identifying compounds that modulate (i.e., increase or decrease) activity of T1R receptor or dimer comprising contacting T1R receptor or dimer with a compound, and determining whether the compound modifies activity of T1R receptor or dimer. The activity in the presence of the test compound is compared to the activity in the absence of the test compound. Where the activity of the sample containing the test compound is higher than the activity in the sample lacking the test compound, the compound is an agonist. Similarly, where the activity of the sample containing the test compound is lower than the activity in the sample lacking the test compound, the compound is an antagonist.",
                                "Agents that modulate (i.e., increase, decrease, or block) T1R receptor or dimer activity or expression also may be identified, for example, by incubating a putative modulator with a cell containing a T1R polypeptide, dimer, or polynucleotide and determining the effect of the putative modulator on T1R receptor activity or expression. The selectivity of a compound that modulates the activity of T1R receptor or dimer can be evaluated by comparing its effects on T1R receptor or dimer to its effect on other T1R receptors or dimers. Selective modulators may include, for example, antibodies and other proteins, peptides, or organic molecules that specifically bind to a T1R polypeptide or a T1R receptor-encoding nucleic acid. Modulators of T1R receptor activity will be therapeutically useful in treatment of diseases and physiological conditions in which normal or aberrant T1R receptor activity is involved. Compounds identified as modulating T1R receptor activity may be further tested in other assays including, but not limited to, in vivo models, in order to confirm or quantitate their activity.",

Compounds identified as modulators of binding between T1R receptor and a T1R binding partner may be further tested in other assays including, but not limited to, in vivo models, in order to confirm or quantitate their activity.",
                                "The invention also includes within its scope high-throughput screening (HTS) assays to identify compounds that interact with, enhance, or inhibit biological activity (i.e., affect enzymatic activity, binding activity, etc.) of a T1R receptor or dimer. HTS assays permit screening of large numbers of compounds in an efficient manner. Cell-based HTS systems are contemplated to investigate T1R receptor-ligand interaction. HTS assays are designed to identify \u201chits\u201d or \u201clead compounds\u201d having the desired property, from which modifications can be designed to improve the desired property. Chemical modification of the \u201chit\u201d or \u201clead compound\u201d is often based on an identifiable structure/activity relationship between the \u201chit\u201d and the T1R polypeptide.",

In another embodiment, this process may be automated using a high-throughput screening device.",
                                "Candidate modulators contemplated by the invention include compounds selected from libraries of either potential activators or potential inhibitors. There are a number of different libraries used for the identification of small molecule modulators, including: (1) chemical libraries, (2) natural product libraries, and (3) combinatorial libraries comprised of random peptides, oligonucleotides, or organic molecules. Chemical libraries consist of random chemical structures, some of which are analogs of known compounds or analogs of compounds that have been identified as \u201chits\u201d or \u201cleads\u201d in other drug discovery screens, some of which are derived from natural products, and some of which arise from non-directed synthetic organic chemistry. Natural product libraries are collections of microorganisms, animals, plants, or marine organisms that are used to create mixtures for screening by: (1) fermentation and extraction of broths from soil, plant, or marine microorganisms or (2) extraction of plants or marine organisms. Natural product libraries include polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and variants (non-naturally occurring) thereof. For a review, see Science 282:63-68 (1998). Combinatorial libraries are composed of large numbers of peptides, oligonucleotides, or organic compounds as a mixture. These libraries are relatively easy to prepare by traditional automated synthesis methods, PCR, cloning, or proprietary synthetic methods. Of particular interest are non-peptide combinatorial libraries. Still other libraries of interest include peptide, protein, peptidomimetic, multiparallel synthetic collection, recombinatorial, and polypeptide libraries. For a review of combinatorial chemistry and libraries created therefrom, see Myers, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 8:701-707 (1997). Identification of modulators through use of the various libraries described herein permits modification of the candidate \u201chit\u201d (or \u201clead\u201d) to optimize the capacity of the \u201chit\u201d to modulate activity.",
                                "T1R receptor binding partners that stimulate T1R receptor activity are useful as agonists in disease states or conditions characterized by insufficient T1R receptor signaling (e.g., as a result of insufficient activity of a T1R receptor ligand). T1R receptor binding partners that block ligand-mediated T1R receptor signaling are useful as T1R receptor antagonists to treat disease states or conditions characterized by excessive T1R receptor signaling. Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a disease or abnormal condition by administering to a patient in need of such treatment a substance that modulates the activity or expression of a polypeptide having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:61, or SEQ ID NO:64, or exhibiting substantially the same biological activity as a polypeptide having a sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:61, or SEQ ID NO:64, or dimers thereof.",

                                "The T1R polynucleotides of the invention may also be used to identify compounds for which an organism having the receptor exhibits a taste preference or indifference using cell signaling assays known in the art. In such assays, polynucleotide encoding a T1R is incorporated into an expression vector and transfected into a host cell. The expression of the T1R may be inducible or constitutive. The host cells expressing the T1R receptor are contacted with candidate compounds and the effect of each compound on the cells is assayed. Stimulation of a response is indicative of reactivity to the test compound and correlates with compounds associated with a taste preference. The assays that can be used to assess stimulation of T1R receptor include, but are not limited to assays measuring ion conductance, ion flow, calcium imaging (e.g., using fura-2, green dextran activity or aequorin activity), voltage measurement and or voltage imaging with dyes, expression of reporter genes (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-lactamase, fluorescent binding protein), receptor binding assays, second messenger assays (e.g., IP3, cAMP), G-protein activation based assays (e.g., modulation of GTP-gamma-S binding), receptor phosphorylation measures, and the like. In some embodiments analysis of stimulation of T1R receptors and receptor dimers may be determined using a FLIPR\u00ae assay as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Devices, Corp.).",

Genetic engineering of cells to produce fluorescent proteins, such as modified green fluorescent protein (GFP), as a reporter molecule is also well known in the art. Fluorescence-based reagents are useful for the assay of many cell functions including ion concentrations, membrane potential, specific translocations, enzyme activities, gene expression, as well as the presence, amounts and patterns of metabolites, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acid sequences.",
                                "Cell signaling assays known in the art may also be used to identify T1R antagonists. Expression of G protein coupled receptors at very high concentration in a heterologous system has been shown to result in constitutive cell signaling. For example, but not by way of limitation, T1R receptor may be overexpressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. Alternatively, for example, T1R may be operably linked to a CMV promoter and expressed in COS or HEK293 cells. In the activated constitutive state, test compounds may be assayed for their ability to inhibit constitutive cell signaling activity. Suitable assays include, but are not limited to assays measuring ion conductance, ion flow, calcium imaging (e.g., using fura-2, green dextran activity or aequorin activity), voltage measurement and/or voltage imaging with dyes, expression of reporter genes (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, beta-lactamase, fluorescent binding protein), receptor binding assays, second messenger assays (e.g., IP3, cAMP), G-protein activation based assays (e.g., modulation of GTP-gamma-S binding), receptor phosphorylation measures, and the like."

For example, but not by way of limitation, one may obtain paraffin-embedded sections of tissues of interest (from human or other species) or use fresh tissue. Tissue sections may be treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 minutes to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. The tissues may then be incubated in anti-T1R antibody (or an antisera raised against T1R) at 4\u00b0 C. for hours to days. The tissues may then be treated with a secondary antibody that specifically binds to the primary antibody (such as a heterologous species' serum raised against the primary species immunoglobulin). The secondary antibody may be conjugated to biotin, for example. The tissue sections are further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin at room temperature. After each step, tissue sections are rinsed in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoreaction products may be visualized through reaction with 0.0125% diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.002% H2O2 in 0.05M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The sections are counterstained with hematoxylin and viewed with a light microscope. Other antibody-based assays to examine tissues for T1R expression may be used.

For example, the Tas1r gene may be expressed such that an increased level of Tas1r RNA results in feedback inhibition of expression of at least one of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3. In other embodiments of the invention, the Tas1r gene may be expressed such that an increased level of T1R RNA results in an increase in the expression of at least one of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3. In other embodiments, the Tas1r gene may be repressed such that a decreased level of Tas1r RNA results in an increase in the expression of at least one of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3. In other embodiments, the Tas1r gene may be repressed such that a decreased level of Tas1r RNA results in a concomitant decrease in the expression of at least one of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3. The gene modulation may be tissue- or species-specific. Thus, expression of Tas1r may be regulated using the expression vectors of the invention using inducible promoters and tissue-specific promoters, for example. Alternatively, expression of Tas1r may be repressed in cells that produce T1R using antisense RNA and other inhibitory strategies described herein and as are known in the art. The modulation of the T1R receptor family in patients may be useful for altering metabolism, nutrient uptake, neural function, and to treat disorders associated with an abnormally low or high level of T1R expression in cells.",

                                "Mimetics or mimics of compounds identified herein (sterically similar compounds formulated to mimic the key portions of the structure) may be designed for pharmaceutical use. Mimetics may be used in the same manner as the compounds identified by the present invention that modulate the T1R receptor and hence are also functional equivalents. The generation of a structural-functional equivalent may be achieved by the techniques of modeling and chemical design known to those of skill in the art. It will be understood that all such sterically similar constructs fall within the scope of the present invention.",
                                "The design of mimetics to a known pharmaceutically active compound is a known approach to the development of pharmaceuticals based on a \u201clead\u201d compound. This is desirable where, for example, the active compound is difficult or expensive to synthesize, or where it is unsuitable for a particular method of administration, e.g., some peptides may be unsuitable active agents for oral compositions as they tend to be quickly degraded by proteases in the alimentary canal.",
                                "There are several steps commonly taken in the design of a mimetic. First, the particular parts of the compound that are critical and/or important in determining its T1R-modulating properties are determined. In the case of a polypeptide, this can be done by systematically varying the amino acid residues in the peptide, e.g. by substituting each residue in turn. Alanine scans of peptides are commonly used to refine such peptide motifs.",
                                "Once the active region of the compound has been identified, its structure is modeled according to its physical properties, e.g. stereochemistry, bonding, size, and/or charge, using data from a range of sources, such as, but not limited to, spectroscopic techniques, X-ray diffraction data, and NMR. Computational analysis, similarity mapping (which models the charge and/or volume of the active region, rather than the bonding between atoms), and other techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used in this modeling process.",
                                "In a variant of this approach, the three-dimensional structure of the compound that modulates a T1R receptor and the active region of the T1R receptor are modeled. This can be especially useful where either or both of these compounds change conformation upon binding. Knowledge of the structure of the ligand-binding domain (for example, residues 1-571 of SEQ ID NO:2) of the receptor also allows the design of high potency ligands and/or modulators.",
                                "A template molecule is then selected onto which chemical groups that mimic the T1R modulator can be grafted. The template molecule and the chemical groups grafted onto it can conveniently be selected so that the mimetic is easy to synthesize, is pharmacologically acceptable, and does not degrade in vivo, while retaining the biological activity of the lead compound. Alternatively, where the mimetic is peptide-based, further stability can be achieved by cyclizing the peptide, thereby increasing its rigidity. The mimetic or mimetics found by this approach can then be screened by the methods of the present invention to see whether they have the ability to modulate the T1R receptor. Further optimization or modification can then be performed to arrive at one or more final mimetics for in vivo or clinical testing.",

Methods for detecting a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention in a biological sample may comprise any method known to the skilled artisan, including but not limited to the methods of detection mentioned herein. An organism having a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention in its biological sample is predicted to exhibit characteristics of taste perception of a domestic cat. For example, an organism having a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention, such as a polynucleotide encoding a feline T1R1 receptor or the polypeptide encoded thereby, will be attracted to one or more amino acids. An organism having a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention may show no preference for one or more carbohydrates or high-intensity sweeteners. As an example, an organism having a polynucleotide encoding a single transmembrane domain T1R2 receptor, for example the feline T1R2 receptor of the invention, or the polypeptide encoded thereby, would be predicted to show a reduced or no response to sweet taste stimuli relative to an organism having a 7-transmembrane domain T1R2 receptor An organism having a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention may be attracted to one or more amino acids and may exhibit no preference for one or more carbohydrates or high-intensity sweeteners. For example, an organism having a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention, such as a polynucleotide encoding a feline T1R1 receptor or the polypeptide encoded thereby, and further having a polynucleotide encoding a single transmembrane domain T1R2 receptor, for example the feline T1R2 receptor of the invention, or the polypeptide encoded thereby, will be attracted to one or more amino acids and will exhibit no preference for one or more carbohydrates or high-intensity sweeteners.",

B. Birren, et al., pp. 187-215, 1999). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). This strategy involves the use of the shortest DNA probes among the many kinds of probes used in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library screening. These probes are comprised of two DNA sequences (e.g., 22 mers) with a complementary 8 base overlap. They can be designed by computer program available online, for example, through the Washington University School of Medicine Genome Sequencing Center, and are readily synthesized.",

The overlapping sequences of the seven DVL1 overgo probes used in the present invention were as follows:",

After transformants were arrayed to a nylon membrane, two separate hybridizations were performed using seven DVL1 and twelve T1R3 overgo probes (SEQ ID NOS:35-58). Two clones positive for DVL1 and four clones positive for T1R3 were found. These clones were confirmed by sequencing. Because DVL1 is the neighboring gene of T1R3 in human and mouse, it is likely this also is the case in cat; therefore, the DVL1 positive clones verified that the BAC 552J19 is the correct BAC, that is, it is the one containing feline T1R3."

Approximately 10 kb of genomic sequence containing the open reading frame (ORF) for cat T1R1 and approximately 38 kb of genomic sequence containing the open reading frame for cat T1R2 were obtained. FIGS. 6A-D show the genomic sequence of cat T1R1 (SEQ ID NO:59) obtained from BAC sequencing. FIGS. 7A-E show the genomic sequence of cat T1R2 (SEQ ID NO:62) obtained from BAC sequencing. The letter \u201cN\u201d denotes gaps between exons or unknown sequences. FIGS. 1A-1I show the multiple sequence alignment of the cDNAs encoding T1R receptors of domestic cat (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:60; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:63; and T1R3, SEQ ID NO:99) with known nucleotide sequences of receptors of the T1R family from human (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:8; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:5; T1R3, SEQ ID NO:11), mouse (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:6; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:3; T1R3, SEQ ID NO:9), and rat (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:7; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:4; T1R3, SEQ ID NO:10). An asterisk (*) indicates a conserved nucleotide position among the sequences. A heart (\u2661) indicates the stop codon of feline T1R2.",
                                "FIGS. 2A-D show the deduced amino acid sequences of the feline T1R taste receptors (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:61; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:64; and T1R3, SEQ ID NO:2) aligned with the amino acid sequences of members of the T1R receptor family from human (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:17; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:20; T1R3, SEQ ID NO:12), rat (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:16; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:19; T1R3, SEQ ID NO:14), and mouse (T1R1, SEQ ID NO:15; T1R2, SEQ ID NO:18; T1R3, SEQ ID NO:13). An asterisk (*) indicates a conserved nucleotide position among the sequences. A colon (:) indicates an observed conserved amino acid substitution. A period (.) indicates an observed semi-conserved amino acid substitution. The cat T1R1 is very similar to human and rodents in terms of gene structure; however, cat T1R2 predicts a shorter protein of 391 amino acids compared with the human T1R2, which has 839 amino acids. This prediction of a short T1R2 is the result of a stop codon TAA in exon 3. The deduced amino acid sequence for cat T1R3 (SEQ ID NO:2) contains four additional amino acids at positions 11-14 relative to the homologous T1R3 receptors of mouse (SEQ ID NO:13), human (SEQ ID NO:12), and rat (SEQ ID NO:14). The deduced sequence for cat reveals a threonine in position 64, a position equivalent to amino acid 60 in mouse, and a leucine at position 59, a position equivalent to position 55 in mouse. In mouse, amino acid substitutions of a threonine at position 60 and an alanine at position 55, both positions located within the putative extracellular N-terminal domain of the polypeptide, are present in strains of mice demonstrating low preference for the sweet stimulus saccharin (Bachmanov et al., Chem. Senses, 26:925-933 (2001)). Leucine is a conservative substitution for alanine. Accordingly, the amino acid sequence differences of cat and mouse T1R3 receptor may account for functional differences that lead to different taste preferences between the two species.",
                                "FIG. 3 illustrates a phylogenetic tree showing the relatedness of the domestic cat T1R receptor family to the T1R family of receptors including human, rat, and mouse T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3. The T1R receptors of the rat and mouse are closely related, while the T1R receptors of human and cat diverge from rat and mouse. Interestingly, the sweet stimuli to which the rat and mouse respond are very similar, whereas those that stimulate the human and those that stimulate the cat differ from one another and from those for rat and mouse. For example, humans are unique in their ability to taste most high-intensity sweeteners, while cats find many amino acids attractive but are unable to taste most carbohydrate and high-intensity sweeteners. The cat T1R2 diverges from that of human, mouse, and rat, which is consistent with the fact that cat does not show preference for the carbohydrate sweeteners.",
                                "FIG. 4 illustrates the predicted conformation of cat T1R3 receptor. The cat T1R3 receptor is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor. The structure of the feline T1R3 receptor was generated through use of the protein modeling program available online through the European Bioinformatics Institute.",
                                "FIG. 5A shows the predicted conformation of cat T1R1, indicating that the receptor is a 7-transmembrane-type receptor. FIG. 5B illustrates the predicted conformation of cat T1R2. Since feline T1R2 is a short protein (391 amino acids), a 7 transmembrane domain protein is not predicted. Without seven transmembrane domains, the cat T1R2 receptor may not interact appropriately with a dimerization partner, such as T1R3, and/or the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in the cat's inability to taste sweet carbohydrates. The cat T1R2 may have another function.",
                                "Table 4 shows the percent homology among the members of the T1R family in relation to the cat T1R taste receptors. The portion of Table 1 to the left of the diagonal (in bold type) shows the percent homology based on the open reading frame of the nucleotide sequences obtained from FIG. 1 for the T1R family among human, cat, rat and mouse. The upper portion to the right of the diagonal (in italic type) shows the percent homology of the T1R members based on the amino acid sequences of FIG. 2. Cat T1R1 shows 84% nucleotide sequence homology with human T1R1, 78% with rat T1R1 and 79% with mouse T1R1. At the amino acid level, cat T1R1 shows 81% homology with human T1R1, 74% with rat, and 74% with mouse. Cat T1R1 shows generally low homology with the other known members of the T1R family, T1R2 and T1R3, from human, rat and mouse. The same range of relatively low homology is present among the human, rat and mouse T1R1, T1R2 and T1R3 receptors from the same species. Cat T1R2 shows 72% nucleotide sequence homology with human T1R2, 61% with rat T1R2 and 64% with mouse T1R2. At the amino acid level, cat T1R2 shows 58% homology with human T1R2, 52% with rat, and 53% with mouse. Since cat T1R2 has a shorter protein (391aa) due to a stop codon in exon 3, cat T1R2 shows much lower homology with T1R2 in other species than the homology for T1R1 and T1R3 among different species, which indicates that cat T1R2 is very different from that of the other species. This is also consistent with the behavioral responses showing that cats do not show preference for carbohydrate sweeteners. This indicates that cat T1R2 may not be functional, freeing it from selective pressure. Therefore mutations in cat T1R2 most likely have accumulated. Cat T1R2 shows generally low homology with the other members of the T1R family, T1R1 and T1R3, from human, rat and mouse. The same range of relatively low homology is present among the human, rat, and mouse T1R2 and the T1R1 and receptors from the same species."
