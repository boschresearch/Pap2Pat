                        "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by progressive nephropathy that, without therapeutic intervention, will worsen; ultimately the patient may reach end stage renal disease (ESRD). Prevalence data from the U.S. to Europe show that approximately 10% of the general population have stage 1-3 CKD (ERA, 2009; USRDS, 2011; Jha et al. Chronic kidney disease: global dimension and perspectives. Lancet. 2013; 382:260-72). Worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of CKD and ESRD are increasing while therapeutic outcomes remain poor (Shaw et al. Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030. Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2010; 87:4-14). The greatest cause of ESRD is diabetes mellitus (Postma and de Zeeuw, 2009), and the incidence of CKD continues to increase, primarily due to the increases in the incidence of type 2 diabetes (Postma and de Zeeuw, 2009). CKD is often accompanied by adverse outcomes owing to underlying comorbidities and/or risk factors including hypertension and renovascular disease (Khan et al., 2002; Stenvinkel P. Chronic kidney disease\u2014a public health priority and harbinger of premature cardiovascular disease J Intern med. 2010; 268:456-67). Due to serious comorbidities, patients with CKD are 5-11 times more likely to suffer premature death than survive to progress to ESRD (Collins et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2004). In order to survive, ESRD patients require renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation). Preventing or delaying adverse outcomes of CKD by intervening early-on in the disease is the primary strategy in CKD management. Unfortunately, early therapeutic approaches to prevent disease progression have not been successful.",
                        "As CKD is characterized by low kidney cell proliferation and loss of regenerative processes (Messier and Leblond. Cell proliferation and migration as revealed by radiography after injection of thymidine-H3 into male rats and mice. Am J Anat. 1960; 106:247-85) maladaptive responses and fibrosis lead to progression of CKD. While standard of care therapies, such as strict glycemic control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis slow progression of diabetic nephropathy, they do not arrest or reverse it. A number of novel treatment strategies, such as antiproteinuric treatments, inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, antifibrotic agents, endothelin receptor antagonists, or transcription factors may slow or arrest progression of diabetic kidney disease (Quiroga et al. Present and future in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. J Diabetes Res. 2015; 2015:801348). In addition, renal cell-based therapy have attracted recent interest as regeneration of tissues and organs is now within the technological reach of modern medicine (Ludlow et al. The Future of Regenerative Medicine: Urinary System. Tissue Engineering. 2012; 18:218-24).",
                        "New treatment paradigms involving tissue engineering and cellular-based applications have been described that provide substantial and durable augmentation of kidney functions, slow progression of disease and improve quality of life in this patient population. These next-generation regenerative medicine technologies provide isolated renal cells as a therapeutic option for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Presnell et al. WO/2010/056328 and Ilagan et al. PCT/US2011/036347 describe isolated bioactive renal cells, and methods of isolating and culturing the same, as well as methods of treatment with the cell populations. Injection of these bioactive renal cells into recipient kidneys has resulted in significant improvement in animal survival and kidney function, as evidenced for example by urine concentration and filtration functions, in nonclinical studies."

The first and second injections may be administered at any time up to 3 months apart, any time up to 6 months apart or at annual intervals. In one embodiment, the second injections is administered any time up to 3 years after the 1st injection. The composition may also be administered as one, two or more injections in one or both kidneys. In one embodiment, the composition is administered to subjects who contemporaneously receive standard-of-care treatment for CKD prior to receiving injections of NKA. In another embodiment, the two or more injections do not result in adverse immunogenic effects. In one embodiment, the composition is injected into one kidney of the patient. In another embodiment, the composition is injected into both kidneys of the patient. In yet another embodiment, single or multiple entry points may be used to inject the composition into the kidney of the patient. In yet another embodiment, the injection is into the renal parenchyma. In one embodiment, the patient receives a therapeutic dose at any given injection site. In a further embodiment, the patient receives a dose of 1-9\u00d7106 SRC/g KWest at any given injection site.",
                        "In some embodiments, the patient with CKD is further diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying cause of the CKD may be diabetic nephropathy in these patients. In one embodiment, the patient's CKD is defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the range of 15 to 60 mL/min. In another embodiment, the patient with CKD exhibits microalbuminuria may be defined by a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR)\u226530 mg/g or urine albumin excretion \u226530 mg/day on 24 hour urine collection.",
                        "In all embodiments, the patient's kidney function is improved as a result of the treatment. In one embodiment, the improved kidney function is demonstrated by a reduction in the rate of decline or increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In another embodiment, the improved kidney function is demonstrated by reduction in total serum creatinine or the rate of increase in serum creatine (sCr). In one other embodiment, the improved kidney function is demonstrated by improved renal cortical thickness. The improved kidney function may be demonstrated by structural and functional alterations. In some additional embodiments, the improved kidney function is demonstrated by improvement in one or more of the factors in Table 5. In yet another embodiment, the improved kidney size and/or structure is determined by renal imaging. The method of renal imaging may be selected from among the technologies including ultrasound, MRI, and renal scintigraphy.

                                "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by progressive nephropathy that without therapeutic intervention will worsen until the patient reaches end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is defined as reduced kidney function, demonstrated by decreased estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) or evidence of kidney damage, such as increased excretion of urinary albumin. Global prevalence of CKD is estimated at 8-16%. (Jha et al. Chronic kidney disease: global dimension and perspectives. Lancet. 2013; 382:260-72.) CKD is associated with considerable morbidity, such as diabetes mellitus, (Postma and de Zeeuw. The economic benefits of preventing end-stage renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2009; 24:2975-2983) and is often accompanied by adverse outcomes owing to underlying disease states or and/or risk factors such as hypertension and renovascular disease. (Khan et al. Health care utilization among patients with chronic kidney disease. Kidney Int. 2002; 62:229-236) Ninety-seven percent of patients with moderate to severe CKD have mostly asymptomatic Stage 3 disease, but even this stage of CKD bears a two- to four-fold rise in cardiovascular disease risk along with a significant increase in all-cause mortality. (Keith et al. Longitudinal follow-up and outcomes among a population with chronic kidney disease in a large managed care organization. Arch Intern Med. 2004; 164:659-63; Gansevoort et al. Chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular risk: epidemiology, mechanisms, and prevention. Lancet. 2013; 382:339-52) Only a small proportion of patients progress to ESRD (ie, Stage 5 disease); even with costly treatments, however, patients with ESRD experience substantial morbidity and mortality. (Keith et al. Longitudinal follow-up and outcomes among a population with chronic kidney disease in a large managed care organization. Arch Intern Med. 2004; 164:659-63) To survive, ESRD patients require renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation). Preventing or delaying adverse outcomes of CKD via early intervention is the primary strategy in CKD management. (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Chronic kidney disease: early identification and management of chronic kidney disease in adults in primary and secondary care (CG182) London: NICE; 2014) Nevertheless, early treatments have been less than optimal, resulting in a significant unmet medical need for improved interventional strategies to manage CKD and delay progression to ESRD.",

(Stevens et al. Assessing kidney function\u2014Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate. New Engl J Med. 2006; 354:2473-83) Creatinine clearance is the principal endogenous marker that is used to measure GFR. In February 2002, with the aim of providing a uniform definition of CKD, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the US Kidney Foundation defined CKD and the various stages of CKD (Table 1) (Levey et al. National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification. Ann Int Med. 2003; 139:137-47). For example, the threshold for CKD is 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, which is less than one-half of the GFR for a normal, young adult male (120-130 mL/min/1.73 m2). (Levey et al. Definition and classification of chronic kidney disease: apposition statement from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). Kidney Int. 2005; 67:2089-100) Additionally, there is a heightened risk for CKD complications when the GFR is 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and lower.",

KDOQI clinical practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification. Am J Kidney Dis. 39:S1-266) The initial stage of diabetic nephropathy (Stage 1) occurs over a period of several years and is characterized by microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 hr) followed by macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/24 hr). As the ability of the kidney to filter blood waste products declines, serum creatinine rises. With increasing kidney damage (Stages 2-4), rising blood pressure further exacerbates kidney disease. When the kidneys cease to function entirely (Stage 5 [ESRD]), renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) is required.",

JAMA. 2001; 286:421-26) Collectively, the aim is to lower cardiovascular risk and prevent or slow the progression of kidney failure via administration of: 1) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) to decrease proteinuria and control hypertension; 2) insulin and anti-diabetic agents for glycemic control (eg, reduced serum hemoglobin A1c); and, 3) statin therapy to counter dyslipidemia.",
                                "When a patient reaches ESRD, renal replacement therapy (ie, dialysis or transplantation) is indicated. The vast majority of Stage 5 patients receive hemodialysis. (Dhingra et al. Type of vascular access and mortality in US hemodialysis patients. Kidney Int. 2001; 60:1443-51) Dialysis replaces about 5-15% of kidney function, depending on the intensity and frequency of use; dialysis also helps to restore fluid and electrolyte balance when kidneys fail. However, the life-expectancy of an ESRD patient initiating hemodialysis is only 4-5 years. (US Renal Data System. 2012 Annual data report: Atlas of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in the US. National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, Md.) Additionally, hemodialysis has been associated with multiple, serious complications as well as interference with quality of life, such as the need to undergo dialysis up to three times per week. Although kidney transplantation remains the most effective form of therapy at this time; there is a chronic shortage of organs. If a patient is able to secure a kidney for transplantation, long-term immunosuppressive therapy is required to prevent rejection. Use of these regimens results in a higher incidence of infection and, over the long term, some types of cancer. (Almeida et al. Safety of immunosuppressive drugs used as maintenance therapy in kidney transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2013; 6:1170-94) Taken together, there is a critical medical need for improved therapies for CKD which could dramatically slow the progression of disease and significantly delay the need for renal transplantation.",

As described in the literature, volume measurements of the kidney in mLs obtained by different methods are approximately 92-97% of dry weight measurements in grams obtained by measuring isolated organs trimmed of perirenal fat. Therefore, as a conservative estimation, doses of NKA will be calculated using a conversion of 1 g equals 1 mL. Using this ratio represents the safest approach as it guarantees patients will not receive doses higher than corresponding doses in animal studies. Dosage will be determined by the surgeon at the time of injection based on the patient's kidney weight. The maximum volume for any patient will be 8.0 mL; that is, if any subject has a left kidney with a calculated weight \u2265259 g, then that subject will receive 8 mL of NKA.",

NKA was manufactured from SRC obtained from a patient's biopsy, formulated with gelatin biomaterial, and injected back into the patient's left kidney. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and optimal injection of NKA injected at one site in a recipient kidney as measured by procedure and/or product related adverse events (AEs) through 12 months post-injection. The secondary objective of the study was to assess changes in renal function over a 12 month period following injection as measured by laboratory assessments.

Moving the peritoneum medially by blunt manual dissection created a retroperitoneal space (Wadstrom J. Transplantation. 2005; 80:1060-8). The medio-anterial portion of Gerota's fascia of the left kidney was opened to expose the peri-renal fatty tissue, which was abundant in all cases. The fatty tissue was removed to expose the kidney capsule, essentially all of the medial and lateral aspects as well as almost the entire convex/lateral part of the kidney. The extensive dissection allowed to position the kidney in alignment with the injecting needle and to visualize if there was any penetration or leakage of the injected material. From the left iliac fossa a guiding cannula was inserted transcutaneously to puncture the kidney capsule at the lower pole. An 18G needle was thereafter inserted through the guiding cannula into the renal cortex along the convex longitudinal axis of the kidney. Two mL of NKA was deposited at 4, 3, 2 and 1 cm from the puncture of the capsule over a 10-15 minute time period (total 8 mL). The needle was kept in place 5 minutes to promote haemostasis. No per-operative bleeding and only minimal amounts of NKA (<1 mL) was seen backing out of the puncture hole in any of the procedures. The wound was not drained and the abdominal wall was closed with a running suture. The US patient (#7) underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic renal cell implantation in the left renal cortex. Dosing of NKA was determined by estimated kidney weight (the maximum volume for any patient was 8 mL, which all subjects received).",

In a diabetic animal model of aggressive chronic kidney disease, the optimal outcomes of delaying death from end-stage kidney disease were obtained when animals were treated in both kidneys. In the interest of safety, in the first clinical studies of NKA, only 1 kidney was injected with NKA, and therefore a therapeutic signal was not necessarily expected. However, after monitoring the progress of CKD in this cohort of patients for \u02dc1 year, the decline in renal function projected for this cohort was modified by a single injection of NKA into a single kidney (left).

The objective in either case is to approach at an angle allowing deposition of NKA in the renal cortex, distributed as widely as feasible. This could require imaging the kidney in a longitudinal or transverse approach, depending upon individual patient characteristics. Ideally the injection will involve multiple deposits as the injection needle/cannula is gradually withdrawn. The volume to be injected is determined by the weight of the kidney as estimated from the MRI, up to a maximum of 8 mL. For an 8 mL injection, it is anticipated that one to two mL will be deposited in 8 to 4 increments, respectively. Up to two entry points may be used to deposit the full volume of NKA into the kidney (two entry points per kidney were routinely used in all of the animal studies). NKA must be administered slowly at a rate no faster than 2 mL/min, ensuring viability of the NKA. If possible, the injection procedure will be viewed by the sponsor and actual injection of the kidney will be recorded on video for use as an educational/training tool.

Initially, the kidney capsule will be pierced using a 15-20 gauge access trocar/cannula inserted approximately 1 cm into the kidney cortex (but not advanced further into the kidney). NKA is contained in a syringe that will be attached to a blunt tipped inner needle or flexible cannula (18-26 gauge, as suitable for the access cannula). In the Phase 1 clinical study, NKA was delivered via an 18G needle. The proposed Phase II study will utilize an 18 gauge or smaller needle (18-26 gauge) for NKA injection. The needle will be threaded inside the access cannula and advanced into the kidney, from which the NKA will be administered. Injection of the NKA will be at a rate of 1-2 ml/min. After each 1-2 minute injection, the inner needle will be retracted along the needle course within the cortex to the second site of injection; and so forth until the needle tip is at the end of the access cannula or the entire cell volume has been injected. This procedure can be used for both laparoscopic (used previously in Phase I study) and percutaneous injection of NKA. For percutaneous injection of NKA, the placement of the access cannula/trocar and needle will be performed using direct, real-time image guidance.

As noted above, therapeutic intervention with NKA is intended to delay the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant) which, based on the current standard-of-care, is inevitable for patients with end-stage CKD. The purpose of the present study is to compare the safety and efficacy of up to 2 injections of NKA given 3 months (+12 weeks) apart (maximum) in subjects who are randomized to receive their first treatment as soon as the NKA product is made available versus subjects who are randomized to undergo contemporaneous, standard-of-care treatment for CKD during the first 12-18 months prior to receiving up to 2 injections of NKA. In addition, each subject's annual rate of renal decline, based on adequate historical, clinical data from 18 months prior to the Screening Visit, will serve as a comparator to monitor the rate of progression of renal insufficiency pre- and post-randomization.",

The scientific rationale, based on non-clinical studies, is that the biologically active component of NKA (homologous, autologous, SRC) delays progression of experimental models of CKD by augmenting renal structure and function. (Bruce et al. Selected renal cells modulate disease progression in rodent models of chronic kidney disease via NF-\u03baB and TGF-\u03b21 pathways. Regen Med. 2015; 10:815-39; Bruce et al. Exposure of cultured human renal cells induces mediators of cell migration and attachment and facilitates the repair of tubular cell monolayers in vitro.

Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine: role of toxicologic pathologists for an emerging medical technology. Toxicol Pathol. 2008; 36:92-6) As a result, the more cells that can be infused, the greater the potential improvement in renal function. The total number of cells that can be delivered into a kidney at one time is limited by the size of the kidney, however, as well as the inelasticity of the renal capsule. Consequently, it may be possible to improve therapeutic benefit by administering greater numbers of SRC via a second injection, given after cells from the first injection have become incorporated into the kidney.",
                                "Apart from increasing SRC numbers by administering 2 NKA injections into the same kidney, the duration of effects can be evaluated. The processes by which functional nephrons become disabled in kidneys with CKD may, over time, adversely affect \u201cnew\u201d cells delivered via NKA injection. Consequently, NKA might not result in long-term, therapeutic benefit. Exploring the effects from a second NKA injection, given at an appropriate interval after the first injection, would address this question.",

Regardless, every attempt should be made to ensure that the second NKA injection is administered 3 months after the first injection. However, if there appears to be any untoward safety risk, or rapid deterioration of renal function, or development of uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension, or development of a malignancy or an intercurrent infection, then the second NKA injection should not be administered.",

                                "Renal biopsy will be performed under sterile conditions using an ultrasound- or CT-guided approach consistent with site practices. Two biopsy cores will be needed to provide sufficient material for the selection of SRC and manufacture of NKA. Likewise, a 16-gauge needle should be used to insure adequate cortical material is obtained. If required, a 15-gauge needle may be used following consultation with the Medical Monitor. Bedside examination of the biopsy cores may be performed, if available, to ensure sufficient cortical material has been obtained.",
                                "Since the biopsy tissue will be used to manufacture NKA, the site must ensure that the tissue cores are harvested using sterile conditions so that the risk of contamination during subsequent cell expansion and selection is minimized.",
                                "Guidance on wound care and pain management following the biopsy procedure will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Briefly, the subject will remain supine for 4 hours with monitoring of hemoglobin, blood pressure, gross hematuria, abdominal/flank pain, and flank ecchymosis. As long as any biopsy-related AEs have resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline, the subject can be discharged from the hospital on the day after the biopsy consistent with site standard practice. Importantly, any pain medication administered after the renal biopsy should be selected carefully, avoiding medications with nephrotoxic potential.",
                                "If a subject experiences significant adverse events following the biopsy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at increased risk for significant adverse effects following NKA injection, then he/she will not be treated with NKA but will be followed until resolution of the event(s) and then discontinuation from the study.",
                                "NKA Injection",
                                "Before performing the NKA injection, the operating physician will evaluate the subject as follows:\n\n\n- - Perform a physical examination to determine the feasibility of the\n    procedure.\n  - Evaluate bleeding parameters, including coagulation panel, PTT-INR,\n    platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other pertinent laboratory\n    studies.\n    - Note: Hemorrhage following NKA injection is a known and\n      foreseeable risk to subjects participating in this study.\n      Therefore, hemoglobin and hematocrit will be measured a)\n      before, b) 4 hours after, and c) 24 hours after each NKA injection\n      and compared to baseline levels.\n  - Review imaging studies, including ultrasound, MRI, and/or CT, to\n    determine route of access, depth of kidney, and appearance of\n    cortical-medullary junction.\n  - Map potential NKA cell deposition sites.\n  - Determine classification and associated perioperative/post-operative\n    risk according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)\n    with respect to airway assessment, medical history, allergies, and\n    medications.\n  - Interview the subject and the subject's family/supporters to discuss\n    the procedure, its risks and possible complications. Answer\n    questions, and obtain written informed consent.",
                                "Prophylactic antibiotics will be given intravenously according to site standard practice. An initial CT scan may be ordered, if necessary, to evaluate adjacent viscera, renal location, and the presence of renal cysts. In conjunction with ultrasound, a CT scan also may help locate the cortical-medullary junction.",
                                "NKA is targeted for injection into the kidney cortex via a needle/cannula and syringe compatible with cell delivery. The intent is to introduce NKA via penetration of the kidney capsule and deposit NKA into multiple sites of the kidney cortex. Initially, the kidney capsule will be pierced using a 15- to 20-gauge trocar/access cannula inserted approximately 1 cm into the kidney cortex.",
                                "In the Phase 1 clinical study, NKA was administered via an 18-gauge needle. The proposed Phase 2 study will utilize an 18-gauge or smaller needle for NKA delivery. The needle will be threaded inside the access cannula and advanced into the kidney, from which the NKA will be administered. Injection of the NKA will be at a rate of 1 to 2 ml/min. After each 1 to 2 minute injection, the inner needle will be retracted along the needle course within the cortex to the second site of injection, and so forth, until the needle tip reaches the end of the access cannula or until the entire NKA product has been injected. Using a percutaneous delivery approach, placement of the access cannula/trocar and delivery needle will be performed using direct, real-time imaging. Options include ultrasound alone or ultrasound with complementary CT.",
                                "During the procedure, moderate conscious sedation will be employed; vital signs will be measured continuously. NKA injection will cease if there is imaging evidence of cell extravasation into central or peripheral renal blood vessels, the medullary portion of the kidney, or through the renal cortex and into the retroperitoneal soft tissues, or evidence of active bleeding.",
                                "Following completion of the NKA injection, the inner needle will be withdrawn and the outer cannula will remain in place for track embolization. During removal of the outer cannula (trocar), the site of the renal cortex puncture and needle track through the retroperitoneum will be embolized with absorbable gelatin particle/pledgets (eg, Gelfoam\u00ae [Pfizer]) or fibrin sealant (eg, TISSEEL [Baxter]) or other suitable agent to prevent excessive renal bleeding.",
                                "Upon completion of the procedure, non-contrast CT scan or ultrasound with color Doppler evaluation will be performed to image puncture site cell injection and any hematoma or bleeding events. The subject will be monitored for 2 to 3 hours post-procedure in a recovery-room environment with nursing assessment and measurement of vital signs. Subjects who do not experience complications may be discharged the same day as NKA injection, consistent with site standard practice."
