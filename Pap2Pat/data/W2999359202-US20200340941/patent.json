These algorithms typically result in orders-of-magnitude increase in the rate of simulated materials discovery. The embodiments described herein couple an iterative machine-learning-based architecture with high-throughput experimental dark electrocatalyst and photo-electrocatalyst screening techniques to accelerate the discovery of electrocatalysts used in energy applications. In one embodiment, the techniques described herein are applied to the discovery of electrocatalysts for fuel cells used in electric and hybrid vehicles, both terrestrial and aquatic. In another embodiment, the techniques described herein are applied to the discovery of electrocatalysts for solar fuels applications in which solar energy is converted to fuel.",

A dark electrocatalyst or photo-electrocatalyst experiment is performed on a subset of the compositions in the candidate sample set, and the resulting one or more experimental properties are input to a machine-learning algorithm that predicts the outcome (i.e., the properties) for the remaining samples in the candidate sample set and identifies one or more samples on which to repeat the experiment during the next iteration. When one or more predetermined termination criteria have been satisfied, the iterative experimental and machine-learning process can terminate. At that point, the system can identify one or more compositions in the candidate sample set for which the one or more measured properties satisfy predetermined performance criteria (e.g., a desired level of catalytic current). The approach to materials discovery just described enables one to learn about the entire set of samples in the candidate sample set by studying (experimenting upon) only 10-20 percent of the samples.",

In FIG. 1, a dark electrocatalyst or photo-electrocatalyst experiment (experiment 120) is performed on selected samples 110 to determine one or more properties (property 130) of the selected samples 110. As those skilled in the art are aware, a \u201cdark electrocatalyst\u201d experiment involves applying an electrical potential (voltage) to the sample, whereas a \u201cphoto-electrocatalyst\u201d experiment involves subjecting the sample to a light-based stimulus. The measured properties of the samples are used to train a machine-learning (ML) model 150 (see ML-based training 140 in FIG. 1). The ML model 150 performs predictions (prediction 160) to yield predicted properties and uncertainties 170 (in other embodiments, only predicted properties are output). Based on the predicted properties and uncertainties 170, samples are selected for the next iteration (selection 180). The operations indicated in FIG. 1 can be performed during one or more iterations (e.g., in a loop) until one or more predetermined termination criteria have been satisfied. The operations indicated in FIG. 1 are elaborated upon below in the context of an algorithm and a system that implements an architecture such as that depicted in FIG. 1.",

For example, a composition might include a specified proportion of the elements iron and oxygen. In one embodiment, the candidate sample set includes materials that can be simultaneously placed on a single xy translational stage of an experimental apparatus. The candidate samples can be derived from uniform or non-uniform discretization of a multi-dimensional sample parameter space. The multi-dimensional sample parameter space could be either a combination of elements or parameters including, but not limited to, temperature, chemical potential of elements, various synthesis methods, etc. The multi-dimensional sample parameter space could also include parameters pertaining to operating conditions for testing electrocatalysts (e.g., using dark electrocatalyst screening techniques or photo-electrocatalyst screening techniques), including, but not limited to, voltage range, electrolyte composition, gas concentration in the electrolyte, additional external stimulus such as photons, and the temperature of the electrolyte.",

Third, such integration can be fully automated to create an autonomous experimental catalyst discovery platform. Fourth, such integration can generate benchmarked models that are applicable for larger chemical and parameter spaces. In a practical demonstration of the techniques described herein, it has been shown that 70-100 percent of the top 2.5 percent of catalysts can be identified after searching through less than 10 percent of the search space. In some materials-discovery settings, the machine-learning techniques described herein can accelerate research by up to a factor of 20 relative to random acquisition.",
