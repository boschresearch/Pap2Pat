    "abstract": "Embodiments of the present invention provide methods for targeted inactivation of viral genomes. In one embodiment, zinc-finger proteins in which DNA binding sites are altered such that they recognize and bind different, desired DNA sequences contained in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that include nuclease domains are used for inactivation. Other embodiments for targeted inactivation of viral genomes use small nucleic acid molecules, such as short micro-RNA molecules or short hairpin RNA molecules capable of mediating RNA interference (RNAi) against the hepatitis B virus.",

The Hepatitis B virus (HBV), for example, is a small, enveloped DNA virus that infects 400 million people worldwide. HBV is unusual among DNA viruses because its replication involves reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. Infection with HBV induces a broad spectrum of liver diseases, including acute hepatitis (that can lead to fulminate hepatic failure) as well as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and heptocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is an effective preventative vaccine, however, 316,000 new cases of HBV-associated cancers are still diagnosed each year.

                        "The genomic DNA of HBV is predominantly in two forms, a partially double stranded form in the cytoplasm and a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus. The cccDNA is an episomal DNA. As used in this application, episomal DNA refers to any fragment of DNA that exists in a cell as an extrachromosomal element. This DNA may or may not be replicated and passed on to daughter cells. A schematic of the HBV life cycle is shown in FIG. 1 (Fields, B. N., Knipe, D. M., Howley, P. M. & Griffin, D. E., \u201cFields' Virology,\u201d XIX, 3087 p. (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, 2001)). The virus particle contains an approximately 3.2 kilobase (kb), partially double stranded (ds), nicked DNA circle with an HBV polymerase protein covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand. HBV enters hepatocytes by binding an unknown receptor. Virions deliver their nucleocapsids to the cytoplasm and viral genomes are transported to the nucleus. There, the partially ds genome is repaired by host factors to form cccDNA, which is the template for transcription of viral RNAs.",
                        "HBV produces four major classes of mRNAs with heterogeneous 5\u2032 ends. The approximate sizes of these mRNAs are 3.5, 2.4, 2.1 and 0.7 kb. The 3.5 kb pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) is the template for replication of the viral DNA minus strand (discussed below). The pgRNA is also translated to produce the viral polymerase (Pol, which reverse transcribes the pgRNA) and the core protein (HBcAg) that forms the viral nucleocapsid. A slightly longer mRNA encodes the pre-core protein, which is cleaved to produce the secreted e antigen (HBeAg). The 2.4 and 2.1 kb mRNAs are translated to produce the viral surface glycoproteins, pre-S1, pre-S2 and S antigen (HBsAg). The 0.7 kb mRNA encodes the X protein whose primary function is still unknown.",
                        "The HBV genome contains extensive overlapping reading frames (FIG. 2). The pgRNA and Pol are encapsulated within core particles in the cytoplasm. Reverse transcription of pgRNA generates an approximately 3.2 kb minus strand DNA whose 5\u2032 end becomes covalently attached to a molecule of Pol. After degradation of the associated pgRNA by an RNase H activity of Pol, DNA synthesis of the positive strand occurs to create partially ds HBV genomic DNA.",
                        "Studies with related hepadnaviruses have shown that partially dsDNA can enter the nucleus and be converted to cccDNA. Wu, T. T., Coates, L., Aldrich, C. E., Summers, J. & Mason, W. S., \u201cIn Hepatocytes Infected with Duck Hepatitis B Virus, the Template for Viral RNA Synthesis is Amplified by an Intracellular Pathway,\u201d Virology, 175, 255-61 (1990). Alternatively, progeny viral particles containing partially ds genomes can be enveloped and secreted. cccDNA plays a role analogous to that of HIV proviral DNA, although in the case of HBV, the cccDNA remains episomal, with 10-20 copies per nucleus. Wu et al., id. As with HIV, the process of reverse transcription is error-prone, resulting in the production of viral quasi-species. HBV cccDNA serves as an archived memory of all such quasi-species, thus facilitating the emergence of viral escape mutants containing multiple mutations.",
                        "Embodiments of the invention described in this application provide for inactivating HBV genomic DNA, RNA or both DNA and RNA to eliminate the HBV infection and prevent progression to HCC. In one embodiment of the invention, chimeric ZFNs that specifically cleave HBV DNAs are used. In other embodiments, high specific activity HBV RNAi therapeutics are used.",
                        "Cleavage of a viral genome can lead to inactivation of proper viral gene expression by several mechanisms. Cleavage can prevent production of a full length functional viral messenger RNA. Cleavage can lead to degradation of the viral genome. Repair of the cleaved viral genome by host DNA repair proteins can lead to nucleotide deletions and insertions, which prevent proper viral gene expression. Other mechanisms of viral inactivation are possible because of ZFN-mediated DNA cleavage."

                                "Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) have modular units that recognize and bind nucleotide groups in a highly specific manner. ZFPs can be engineered into polydactyl proteins containing several fingers with unique binding specificities. As used in this application, engineered zinc finger proteins refer to proteins where the amino acid sequence of their DNA binding domains or recognition sites are altered such that they now recognize and bind a different desired DNA. Such alteration or modification can be accomplished using known molecular biology or chemical synthesis techniques or both. Fusions of ZFPs to cleavage domains results in a chimeric zinc finger. In one embodiment, the cleavage domain is a nuclease domain, resulting in a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN). Binding of two chimeric nucleases to adjacent sites are required for cleavage (See FIG. 3). Chimeric nucleases can specifically target and cleave DNA sequences without affecting non-targeted sequences. ZFNs comprising zinc fingers having a wide variety of DNA recognition and/or binding specificities are within the scope of the present invention. While in the present embodiment, the ZIF268 zinc-finger backbone is utilized it would be clear to one skilled in the art that other naturally occurring or artificial zinc-finger scaffolds could be used.",
                                "Thus ZFNs of the present invention are chimeric protein molecules capable of directing targeted cleavage in a host cell by causing a double stranded break at the target locus. In one embodiment of the invention, a ZFN includes a DNA-binding domain containing zinc fingers operatively linked to a nuclease. In one embodiment, the zinc finger DNA-binding domain is at the N-terminus of the chimeric protein molecule and the nuclease is located at the C-terminus of the molecule. One of skill in the art, however, will appreciate that any configuration of ZFN is within the scope of the present invention.",
                                "A ZFN as herein described must have at least one zinc finger. In one embodiment, a ZFN would have at least three zinc fingers to have sufficient binding affinity and specificity to be useful for targeted inactivation of DNA in a host cell or organism. Adding additional zinc fingers can progressively increase the DNA binding affinity. In one embodiment, the DNA-binding domain comprised of three zinc finger peptides operatively linked to a nuclease. In other embodiments, the ZFN may include four, five or even six, zinc fingers.",
                                "The zinc finger domain may be derived from any class or type of zinc finger. In one embodiment, the zinc finger domain comprises the Cys2His2 type of zinc finger that is very generally represented, for example, by the zinc finger transcription factors TFIIIA or Sp1. In another embodiment, the zinc finger domain comprises three or four Cys2His2 type zinc fingers, or a number of zinc fingers of other types, such as Cys3His1.",
                                "The nuclease domain of the ZFN is derived from a class of non-specific DNA cleavage domains, for example the DNA-cleavage domain of a Type II restriction enzyme. In one embodiment, the DNA-cleavage domain is derived from the Type II restriction enzyme, FokI.",
                                "In one embodiment, a ZFN comprises three Cys2His2 type zinc fingers and a nuclease. According to this embodiment, each zinc finger specifies three consecutive base pairs of DNA creating a nine to ten base pairs recognition sequence for the ZFN DNA binding domain, although zinc fingers differ in their ability to discriminate DNA sites. The DNA-nuclease domain of an embodiment requires dimerization of two ZFN DNA-nuclease domains for effective cleavage of double-stranded DNA. This imposes a requirement for two inverted recognition (target DNA) sites within close proximity for effective targeted cleavage. If all positions in the target sites are contacted specifically, these requirements enforce recognition of a total of approximately 18 base pairs of DNA.",
                                "The choice of zinc fingers allows flexibility in targeting. Some zinc fingers have targeted sites that allow binding to DNA with alternative bases at some positions. Similarly, zinc fingers can bind to target sequences without contact to every base, especially if longer linkers are employed. Because of this and the zinc finger's ability to bind to overlapping sequences, pairs of ZFN differ in the number of DNA base pairs specifically targeted. There are DNA bases between the two sites. The space between recognition sites for ZFNs of the present invention may be equivalent to four, five, or six, even up to 35 base pairs of DNA. The region of DNA between the two recognition sites is herein referred to as the \u201cspacer.\u201d",
                                "In some embodiments of the invention, the ZFN are made with a nuclear localization signal fused to the ZFN to direct the protein to the nucleus. In one embodiment, the sequence of the nuclear localization signal is proline-lysine-lysine-lysine-arginine-lysine-valine (SEQ ID NO: 1). One of skill in the art will appreciate that any sequence conferring nuclear localization to a protein may be used for this purpose. In another embodiment, the ZFN is made without the nuclear localization signal.",
                                "A linker, if present, between the nuclease and recognition domains of the ZFN comprises a sequence of amino acid residues selected so that the resulting linker is flexible. Or, for maximum target site specificity, linkerless constructs are also made. A linkerless construct has a strong preference for binding to and then cleaving between recognition sites that are five-six base pairs apart. However, with linker lengths of between zero and 18 amino acids in length, ZFN-mediated cleavage occurs between recognition sites that are between five and 35 base pairs apart. For a given linker length, there will be a limit to the distance between recognition sites that is consistent with both binding and dimerization. In one embodiment, there is no linker between the cleavage and recognition domains, and the target locus comprises two nine-nucleotide recognition sites in inverted orientation with respect to one another, separated by a six nucleotide spacer.",
                                "Such linkers are typically polypeptide sequences, such as poly gly sequences of between about five and 200 amino acids. Linkers are typically flexible amino acid subsequences which are synthesized as part of a recombinant fusion protein. For example, in one embodiment, the linker DGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 2) is used to link two ZFPs. In another embodiment, the flexible linker linking two ZFPs is an amino acid subsequence comprising the sequence TGEKP (SEQ ID NO: 3) (see, e.g., Liu et al., PNAS 5525 5530 (1997)). In another embodiment, the linker LRQKDGERP (SEQ ID NO: 4) is used to link two ZFPs. In yet another embodiment, the following linkers are used to link two ZFPs: GGRR (SEQ ID NO: 5) (Pomerantz et al. 1995, supra), (G4S)n (Kim et al., PNAS, 93, 1156 1160 (1996.); and GGRRGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 6); LRQRDGERP (SEQ ID NO: 7); LRQKDGGGSERP (SEQ ID NO: 8). Alternatively, flexible linkers can be rationally designed using computer program capable of modeling both DNA-binding sites and the peptides themselves (Desjarlais & Berg, PNAS, 90, 2256-2260 (1993), PNAS, 91, 11099-11103 (1994) or by phage display methods.",
                                "In other embodiments, a chemical linker is used to connect synthetically or recombinantly produced sequences. Such flexible linkers are known to persons of skill in the art. For example, poly(ethylene glycol) linkers are available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. Huntsville, Ala. These linkers optionally have amide linkages, sulfhydryl linkages, or heterofunctional linkages. In addition to covalent linkage of ZFPs to nuclease domains, non-covalent methods can be used to produce molecules with ZFPs associated with nuclease domains.",
                                "In addition to nuclease domains, often the ZFP is expressed as a fusion protein such as maltose binding protein (\u201cMBP\u201d), glutathione S transferase (GST), hexahistidine, c-myc, haemagluten (HA) epitope-tagged, and the FLAG epitope, for ease of purification, monitoring expression, or monitoring cellular and subcellular localization.",
                                "After a target segment has been selected, ZFPs that binds to the segment can be provided by a variety of approaches. One approach is to provide a precharacterized ZFP from an existing collection that is already known to bind to the target site. An alternative approach is to design new ZFPs, which uses the information in a database of existing ZFPs and their respective binding affinities. A still further alternative is to select a ZFP with specificity for a given target by an empirical process such as phage display. In some such methods, each component finger of a ZFP is designed or selected independently of other component fingers. For example, each finger can be obtained from a different preexisting ZFP or each finger can be subject to separate randomization and selection. Typically, a backbone from any suitable C2H2 ZFP, such as SP-1, SP-1C, or ZIF268, is used as the scaffold for the engineered ZFP (see, e.g., Jacobs, EMBO J., 11, 4507 (1992); Desjarlais & Berg, PNAS, 90, 2256-2260 (1993)). A number of methods can then be used to design and select a ZFP with high affinity for its target.",
                                "One skilled in the art can use any suitable method known in the art to design and construct nucleic acids encoding ZFPs, e.g., phage display, random mutagenesis, combinatorial libraries, computer/rational design, affinity selection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning from cDNA or genomic libraries, synthetic construction and the like.

                                "Once a ZFP has been selected, designed, or otherwise provided to a given target segment, the DNA encoding it is synthesized and cloned with the nuclease domain to generate the ZFN. Exemplary methods for synthesizing and expressing DNA encoding zinc finger proteins are described below. ZFPs can be cloned, expressed and tested for binding affinity and specificity. Once the ZFPs are cloned into ZFNs, they can be expressed and used for cleavage of DNA containing the target site to which the ZFPs bind."

In addition, essentially any nucleic acid or polypeptide can be custom ordered from any of a variety of commercial sources.",
                                "Two alternative methods are typically used to create the coding sequences required to express newly designed DNA-binding peptides. One protocol is a PCR-based assembly procedure that uses six overlapping oligonucleotides. Three oligonucleotides correspond to \u201cuniversal\u201d sequences that encode portions of the DNA-binding domain between the recognition helices. These oligonucleotides remain constant for all zinc finger constructs. The other three \u201cspecific\u201d oligonucleotides are designed to encode the recognition helices. These oligonucleotides contain substitutions primarily at positions \u22121,2,3 and 6 on the recognition helices making them specific for each of the different DNA-binding domains.",
                                "The PCR synthesis is carried out in two steps. First, a double stranded DNA template is created by combining the six oligonucleotides (three universal, three specific) in a four cycle PCR reaction with a low temperature annealing step, thereby annealing the oligonucleotides to form a DNA \u201cscaffold.\u201d The gaps in the scaffold are filled in by high-fidelity thermostable polymerase, the combination of Taq and Pfu polymerases also suffices. In the second phase of construction, the zinc finger template is amplified by external primers designed to incorporate restriction sites at either end for cloning into a suitable vector such as a shuttle vector or directly into an expression vector.",
                                "An alternative method of cloning the newly designed DNA-binding proteins relies on annealing complementary oligonucleotides encoding the specific regions of the desired ZFP. This is usually performed before setting up the annealing reactions, but kinasing can also occur post-annealing. In brief, the \u201cuniversal\u201d oligonucleotides encoding the constant regions of the proteins are annealed with their complementary oligonucleotides. Additionally, the \u201cspecific\u201d oligonucleotides encoding the finger recognition helices are annealed with their respective complementary oligonucleotides. These complementary oligos are designed to fill in the region which was previously filled in by polymerase in the protocol described above. The complementary oligos to the common oligos 1 and finger 3 are engineered to leave overhanging sequences specific for the restriction sites used in cloning into the vector of choice. The second assembly protocol differs from the initial protocol in the following aspects: the \u201cscaffold\u201d encoding the newly designed ZFP is composed entirely of synthetic DNA thereby eliminating the polymerase fill-in step, additionally the fragment to be cloned into the vector does not require amplification. Lastly, the design of leaving sequence-specific overhangs eliminates the need for restriction enzyme digests of the inserting fragment.",

The ZFP can be covalently or non-covalently associated with one or more DNA nuclease domains, alternatively two or more DNA nuclease domains, with the two or more domains being two copies of the same domain, or two different domains. The cleavage domains can be covalently linked to the ZFP, e.g., via an amino acid linker, as part of a fusion protein. The ZFPs can also be associated with the DNA nuclease domain via a non-covalent dimerization domain, e.g., a leucine zipper, a STAT protein N terminal domain, or an FK506 binding protein (see, e.g., O'Shea, Science 254: 539 (1991), Barahlmand-Pour et al., Curr.

The enzyme Dicer cleaves these long dsRNAs into short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of approximately 21-23 nucleotides. One of the two siRNA strands is then incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC compares these \u201cguide RNAs\u201d to RNAs in the cell and efficiently cleaves target RNAs containing sequences that are perfectly (or nearly perfectly) complementary to the guide RNA.",

P., \u201cMicroRNAs: Genomics, Biogenesis, Mechanism, and Function,\u201d Cell, 116, 281-97 (2004)). miRNAs are synthesized as part of a hairpin structure embedded within a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) (FIG. 4). Pri-miRNAs are processed in the nucleus by Drosha to make pre-microRNAs. Lee, Y. et al., \u201cThe Nuclear RNase III Drosha Initiates MicroRNA Processing,\u201d Nature, 425, 415-9 (2003).

Of the two RNA strands in an siRNA duplex, only one enters a given RISC and directs cleavage of the target RNA. Khvorova et al. and Schwarz et al. showed that entry into RISC is asymmetrical, with one strand entering preferentially. Schwarz, D. S. et al., \u201cAsymmetry in the Assembly of the RNAi Enzyme Complex,\u201d Cell, 115, 199-208 (2003) and Khvorova, A., Reynolds, A. & Jayasena, S. D., \u201cFunctional siRNAs and miRNAs Exhibit Strand Bias,\u201d Cell, 115, 209-16 (2003). For gene silencing applications, entry of the antisense strand into RISC is desirable since this will guide cleavage by homology to the target mRNA (sense strand). If the sense strand enters RISC, it could direct off-target cleavage of other RNAs. \u201cShort Interfering RNAs can Induce Unexpected and Divergent Changes in the Levels of Untargeted Proteins in Mammalian Cells,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci, USA, 101, 1892-7 (2004), Jackson, A.

                                "The following criteria promote antisense strand entry into RISC and/or potent silencing: 1) weak pairing of the 5\u2032 antisense strand base pairs, 2) weak pairing of bases 9-14 and 3) strong pairing of the 3\u2032 antisense base pairs. Shows the consensus internal stability profile for active siRNAs (adapted from Khvorova, A., Reynolds, A. & Jayasena, S. D., \u201cFunctional siRNAs and miRNAs Exhibit Strand Bias,\u201d Cell, 115, 209-16 (2003)). The authors postulated that an RNA helicase unwinding the siRNA duplex prior to RISC insertion can start at the 5\u2032 end of either strand. Strong base pairing at one end prevents unwinding, leading to dissociation of the helicase. Weak base pairing at the other terminus allows unwinding, and this strand enters RISC. Using these \u201cdesign guidelines\u201d, more potent siRNA duplexes can be selected with greater frequency. Using siRNA duplexes biased for antisense strand entry into RISC should also minimize off-target effects due to incorporation of the undesired sense strand into RISC with subsequent cleavage of non-targeted RNAs.",

Intermediate vectors are typically prokaryote vectors, e.g., plasmids, shuttle vectors, or insect vectors, for storage or manipulation of the nucleic acid encoding ZFP or production of protein. The nucleic acid encoding a ZFN or RNAi trigger is also typically cloned into an expression vector, for administration to an animal cell, preferably a mammalian cell or a human cell, fungal cell, bacterial cell, or protozoal cell.",

In one embodiment, the protein would be fused to a cell-permeable peptide. In other embodiments, the RNA that codes for the particular ZFN and allows their expression may also be introduced into the cell.",

Suitable bacterial and eukaryotic promoters are well known in the art and described, e.g., in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed. 1989); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual (1990); and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et al., eds., 1994). Bacterial expression systems for expressing the nucleic acids are available in, e.g., E. coli, Bacillus sp., and Salmonella (Palva et al., Gene, 22, 229-235 (1983)). Kits for such expression systems are commercially available. Eukaryotic expression systems for mammalian cells, yeast, and insect cells are well known in the art and are also commercially available.",
                                "The promoter used to direct expression of the nucleic acid depends on the particular application. For example, a strong constitutive promoter is typically used for expression and purification of ZFN. When a RNAi trigger is administered in vivo for gene regulation, either a constitutive or an inducible promoter is used, depending on the particular use of the RNAi trigger. In one embodiment of the invention, a promoter for administration of a RNAi trigger can be a constitutive expressed promoter, such as U6 Polymerase III promoter, H1 Polymerase III promoter or a promoter having similar activity. In other embodiments, a Polymerase II promoter could be used.",

A typical expression cassette thus contains a promoter operably linked, for example, to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the ZFN, and signals required, for example, for efficient polyadenylation of the transcript, transcriptional termination, ribosome binding sites, or translation termination. Additional elements of the cassette may include, for example, enhancers, and heterologous spliced intronic signals. For RNAi expression, the vector could also be a polymerase III driven transcript that would consist of a polymerase III promoter and terminate with a polymerase III terminator consisting of a string of 5-6 T residues.",
                                "The particular expression vector used to transport the genetic information into the cell is selected with regard to the intended use of the nucleic acid. Standard bacterial expression vectors include plasmids such as pBR322 based plasmids, pSKF, pET23D, and commercially available fusion expression systems such as GST and LacZ. Epitope tags can also be added to recombinant proteins to provide convenient methods of isolation, for monitoring expression, and for monitoring cellular and subcellular localization, e.g., c-myc, haemaglutinin (HA) epitope or FLAG.",

High yield expression systems are also suitable, such as using a baculovirus vector in insect cells, with the nucleic acid encoding sequence under the direction of the polyhedrin promoter or other strong baculovirus promoters.",

It is only necessary that the particular genetic engineering procedure used be capable of successfully introducing at least nucleic acid into the host cell capable of expressing the nucleic acid or protein of choice, depending on the need.",
                                "Transformation can be carried out by a variety of known techniques which depend on the particular requirements of each cell or organism. Such techniques have been worked out for a number of organisms and cells, and can be adapted without undue experimentation to all other cells. Stable transformation involves DNA entry into cells and into the cell nucleus. For single-celled organisms and organisms that can be regenerated from single-cells (which includes all plants and some mammals), transformation can be carried out in in vitro culture, followed by selection for transformants and regeneration of the transformants. Methods often used for transferring DNA or RNA into cells include forming DNA or RNA complexes with cationic lipids, liposomes or other carrier materials, micro-injection, particle gun bombardment, electroporation, and incorporating transforming DNA or RNA into virus vectors. These techniques are well known in the art.",
                                "Microinjection: Direct microinjection of DNA into various cells, including egg or embryo cells, has also been employed effectively for transforming many species. In the mouse, the existence of pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells that are culturable in vitro has been exploited to generate transformed mice. The ES cells can be transformed in culture, then micro-injected into mouse blastocysts, where they integrate into the developing embryo and ultimately generate germline chimeras. By interbreeding heterozygous siblings, homozygous animals carrying the desired gene can be obtained.",
                                "Adenoviruses: Human adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA tumor viruses with genome sizes of approximate 36 Kb. As a model system for eukaryotic gene expression, adenoviruses have been widely studied and well characterized, which makes them an attractive system for development of adenovirus as a gene transfer system. This group of viruses is easy to grow and manipulate, and they exhibit a broad host range in vitro and in vivo. In lytically infected cells, adenoviruses are capable of shutting off host protein synthesis, directing cellular machineries to synthesize large quantities of viral proteins, and producing copious amounts of virus.",
                                "In general, adenovirus gene transfer systems are based upon recombinant, engineered adenovirus which is rendered replication-incompetent by deletion of a portion of its genome, such as E1, and yet still retains its competency for infection. Sequences encoding relatively large foreign proteins can be expressed when additional deletions are made in the adenovirus genome. For example, adenoviruses deleted in both the E1 and E3 regions are capable of carrying up to 10 kB of foreign DNA and can be grown to high titers in 293 cells.",
                                "Other viral vectors may be employed as expression constructs. Vectors derived from, for example, vaccinia virus and adeno-associated virus (AAV), may be employed. AAVs are small, nonpathogenic, single-stranded DNA viruses. AAVs are replication-deficient and require helper viruses for replication. AAV has been isolated from several species, including primates. Muzyczka, N. & Berns, K. I. Fields Virology, 2327-2359 (Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, 2001). Several AAV serotypes have been investigated as vehicles for liver-directed gene transfer. Recombinant gene delivery vectors based upon AAV2 (rAAV2) have been the most extensively characterized. rAAV2 vectors, which are devoid of all AAV open reading frames were shown in pre-clinical in vivo models to be both efficacious and safe.

E. & Samulski, J., \u201cAdeno-Associated Virus Expression Systems for Gene Transfer,\u201d Curr Opin Biotechnoli, 9, 470-5 (1998). However, rAAV2 transduction efficiencies are low.",

The ZFN may also be tested using a transient expression system with a reporter gene, and then regulation of the target endogenous gene is tested in cells and in animals, both in vivo and ex vivo. The ZFN can be recombinantly expressed in a cell, recombinantly expressed in cells transplanted into an animal, or recombinantly expressed in a transgenic animal, as well as administered as a protein to an animal or cell using delivery vehicles described here.

                                "The ZFNs were evaluated in vitro using a cleavage assay modified from the one described in Mani, M., Kandavelou, K., Dy, F. J., Durai, S. & Chandrasegaran, S., \u201cDesign, Engineering, and Characterization of Zinc Finger Nucleases,\u201d Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 335, 447-57 (2005). The three-finger ZFNs, M16 and M17 provided by Matthew Porteus served as positive controls. Although pairs of HBV ZFNs that bind as heterodimers (see FIG. 3) and cleave HBV sequences can be screened in an initial screen, HBV ZFNs were screened for cleavage of homodimer binding site plasmids that consist of identical inverted binding sites (BS) separated by a six base pair XbaI recognition site. FIG. 5 shows an in vitro cleavage experiment in which one of the HBV ZFNs specifically cut its homodimer binding site plasmids but not non-cognate BS. Briefly, ZFNs were expressed using TnT kits. Various amounts of TnT lysate were added to reaction mixtures containing NEBuffer 4 (New England Biolabs) and 0.5 \u03bcg of cognate or non-cognate (negative control) BS plasmids that had previously been linearized in the plasmid backbone. ZFN-mediated cleavage caused the conversion of a single linear BS band to two correctly sized, smaller bands. A size marker is produced by cleavage of the linear BS with XbaI. Increasing amounts of cognate ZFN (0.5, 1, 2 or 4 \u03bcl) were added (FIG. 5, lanes 3-6). The HBV ZFN A32 cleaved its cognate homodimeric BS to completion with 2-4 \u03bcl of TnT lysate. The smear seen with increasing TnT lysate is RNA from the TnT. No cleavage of the A32 BS is seen with 1 \u03bcl of non-cognate ZFN lysate (FIG. 5, lane 7), nor does A32 cleave a non-cognate BS plasmid (FIG. 5, lane 8). These data demonstrate a HBV ZFN, A32 that binds to a HBV sequence and efficiently cleaves it at an adjacent site.",
                                "To determine if the A32 cuts the 32\u00d732 BS plasmid in cultured cells, 3 \u03bcg of A32 (or an irrelevant ZFN, A5) was co-transfected with 0.5, 0.1, or 0.02 \u03bcg of 32\u00d732 (or an irrelevant BS plasmid as a negative control) into Huh-7 cells in 6-well dishes. As a control, cells were also transfected with the BS plasmids alone. At three days post-transfection, cells were harvested and HIRT DNA (DNA preparation for episomal DNA) was prepared. FIG. 6 shows the result of the Southern blot assay for cells transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg of BS plasmid. The DNA was digested with XmnI, which cuts in the plasmid backbone such that DNA that was not cleaved by a ZFN in cells would run as a linear (uncut) band and DNA that was linearized in cells by ZFN cleavage would run as two bands (only one of which is recognized by the Southern probe). Only when the HBV ZFN A32 is cotransfected with its homodimer BS plasmid 32\u00d732 (FIG. 6, lane 6) is a band corresponding to cleaved DNA observed. By phosphoimager analysis, the inventors determined this band as 3% of the total remaining DNA. No cleavage product is detected in the following: the absence of a ZFN (FIG. 6, lanes 5 & 9), when A32 is cotransfected with a non-cognate BS plasmid, 14\u00d714 (FIG. 6, lane 8); or when a non-cognate ZFN, A5, is co-transfected with the 32\u00d732 BS plasmid (FIG. 6, lane 4). It should be noted that the upper uncut band observed consists of DNA that was never cleaved by A32 or consists of DNA that was cleaved and then repaired. These data demonstrate cleavage of an HBV sequence by a ZFN in cells.",
                                "Linearized HBV BS plasmid DNA could be re-circularized, presumably by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ frequently creates small insertions and deletions that could disrupt an XbaI site between the two A32 binding sites. A restriction endonuclease resistance assay was conducted to detect linearized BS plasmid that had re-circularized with deletions or insertions in the XbaI site between the two A32 binding sites (FIG. 7). 75 ng of HIRT DNA (DNA preparation enriched for episomal DNA) was PCR-amplified with primers flanking the BS using the highly accurate proofreading enzyme, AccuPrime Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR fragments were cleaned up using a Qiagen PCR cleanup kit and the PCR product was quantitated by spectrophotometry. 1.6 \u03bcg of PCR product was digested overnight with 20 units of XbaI. DNA from cells that did not receive A32 and 32\u00d732 was digested to >98% (FIG. 7, lanes 1-8, cut DNA indicated by *), showing that XbaI digestion went to near completion. In cells that received both A32 and 32\u00d732, an XbaI-resistant band was observed (indicated by an arrow) suggesting that this DNA had been cut inside cells by the HBV ZFN, A32, and then imperfectly repaired by host DNA repair enzymes. In the context of HBV genomic DNA, such imperfectly repaired DNA would, at a minimum, cause an amino acid deletion and in two out of three of cases would result in a change of reading frame and would thus be deleterious to the virus.",
                                "To create a standard curve for 1, 5, or 10% uncleavable DNA, 0.016, 0.08, or 0.16 \u03bcg of uncut PCR product was also run on the gel (FIG. 7, lanes 13-15). XbaI-resistant DNA was conservatively estimated to be 5% of the total DNA. No discrete XbaI-resistant 32\u00d732 band was observed when cells were cotransfected with 32\u00d732 and the irrelevant ZFN A5 (FIG. 7, lanes 5-7); and A32 did not cleave the irrelevant BS, 14\u00d714 (FIG. 7, lanes 1-3). These data suggest that A32 is specific for its binding site. The results of this XbaI resistance assay (FIG. 7) and the Southern blot data (FIG. 6) show that at least 8% (3%+5%) of the BS DNA was targeted by the HBV ZFN, A32, in cells within three days. These data do not measure the amount of DNA that was linearized and then destroyed in the cell. Since chronic infection with HBV often takes decades to cause serious disease, small cumulative damage to viral genomes could inactivate the virus.",
                                "FIG. 8 shows another ZFN pair (ZFNs A33 & A34) that binds and robustly cuts in vitro a linear model substrate comprised of two sequences found within HBV separated by five (FIG. 8, even numbered lanes) or six base pair spacer (FIG. 8, odd numbered lanes). The DNA binding sites of A33 and A34 are separated by five base pairs in the HBV genome. These binding sites were not cut when no ZFN is present (FIG. 8, lanes 1 and 2) or by a single ZFN with a specificity for a different site (FIG. 8, site 32, lanes 3 and 4). When present individually, neither A33 nor A34 cut either binding site (FIG. 8, lanes 5-8). A combination of ZFNs A32 and A34, do not cut the binding sites, as expected. Only when both ZFNs A33 and A34 are present do we observe cleavage of the model substrates containing binding sites for ZFNs A33 and A34 with 5 (FIG. 8, lane 12) and 6 (FIG. 8, lane 11) base pair spacing. These data demonstrate a working ZFN pair that bind to adjacent sites within the HBV genome and cooperate to cut the DNA sequence in the spacer between the binding sites.",
                                "The data in FIG. 8 shows that a ZFN pair cut a heteroduplex model substrate composed of a binding site for the ZFN A33 separated from a binding site for the ZFN A34 by six nucleotides (referred to as 33\u00d734) and that the cut 33\u00d734 plasmid was imperfectly repaired.",
                                "The six nucleotides between the binding site contain the recognition site for the XbaI restriction endonuclease. In FIG. 9, HEK-293 cells were transfected with 33\u00d734 as well as 1) pUC19, which does not express a ZFN, 2) A34 alone or 3) A33+A34. Total DNA was isolated from cells using the commonly employed HIRT method designed to enrich for episomal DNA. A short fragment containing the binding site and surrounding sequences was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers that flank the binding site. Two assays were employed to demonstrate imperfect repair. The first, referred to as a nuclease resistance assay makes use of the XbaI site between the binding site. If imperfect repair occurred, this XbaI site would be destroyed. PCR fragments were digested to completion with XbaI (FIG. 9, lanes 1, 3 and 5). Only in lane 5 where both A33 and A34 were present do we observe an XbaI resistant fragment (indicated by *). This demonstrates that A33 and A34 cooperated to cut the 33\u00d734 model DNA substrate in cultured cells and the cut 33\u00d734 was imperfectly repaired. The second assay employs the Surveyor Nuclease which recognizes mismatches in DNA duplexes. PCR fragments were denatured by heating (FIG. 9, lanes 2, 4 and 6) and slowly reannealed to allow fragments with deletions or insertions to hybridize to strands that did not contain insertions or deletions. PCR products were then digested with the Surveyor Nuclease which cleaves at mismatches. Again, only in FIG. 9, lane 6 where both A33 and A34 were present do we observe the appearance of a Surveyor sensitive band (indicated by #). This demonstrates that A33 and A34 cooperated to cut 33\u00d734 in cultured cells and the cut 33\u00d734 was imperfectly repaired."

Binding reactions are incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in ZFN Binding/Cleavage Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 \u03bcM ZnCl2, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 \u03bcg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 100 \u03bcg/ml of tRNA and 1 \u03bcg of salmon sperm DNA). The concentration of active ZFN in each lysate is determined by gel shift as described in Moore, M., Choo, Y. & Klug, A., \u201cDesign of Polyzinc Finger Peptides with Structured Linkers,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, 1432-6 (2001). Briefly, crude lysates are mixed with 32P trace-labeled binding site duplex DNA and mixed with various amounts of cold binding site duplex DNA at concentrations that are well above the dissociation constant (Kd) of the ZFN. The concentration of the cold binding site duplex DNA will be varied from concentrations in stoichiometric excess of the ZFN concentration (80 nM, at which all active ZFN binds DNA) to sub-stoichiometric concentrations (1 nM, at which all DNA is bound). Control reactions containing lysate with no ZFN is included to demonstrate that the lysate alone does not shift the binding site. Reaction mixtures are resolved by 7% non-denaturing PAGE/Tris-glycine (pH 8.5) and quantitated using a Phosphorlmager. A binding curve is fit using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, Pa.). The concentration of active ZFN is calculated using the formula P1/2=\u00bd [DNAo], where P1/2=the concentration of protein required to bind \u00bd of the available binding site and [DNAo]=the concentration of cold binding site duplex DNA at this condition. For example, if \u00bd of the protein is bound at 50 nM binding site duplex DNA then the extract contains 25 nM of ZFN that is competent to bind. Dilutions of lysate is next incubated with trace 32P end-labeled target DNA. Again, bound and unbound protein is resolved by PAGE and a binding curve is constructed to obtain a Kd in arbitrary units. An apparent Kd is calculated using the known dilution and protein concentration determined in the previous assay.",

As a basis for comparison, we used HBVU6#2, the most potent shRNA identified in a previous screen (McCaffrey, A. P., Nakai, H., Pandey, K., Huang, Z., Salazar, F. H., Xu, H., Wieland, S. F., Marion, P. L. and Kay, M. A. (2003) Inhibition of hepatitis B virus in mice by RNA interference. Nat Biotechnol, 21, 639-644). Huh-7 cells were transfected with 2 \u03bcg of the HBV genomic plasmid pTHBV2(23), to initiate a viral replication cycle, as well as 2 \u03bcg of HBVU6#2 or miR expression plasmid. The average of three independent experiments is shown in FIG. 10a & b. While all the miRs target the 3.5 kb HBV RNA, several do not target the 2.4 and 2.1 kb RNAs. We therefore separately assessed silencing of the 3.5 kb RNA in FIG. 10a and silencing of the 2.4+2.1 kb RNAs in FIG. 10b. All rationally designed miRNAs (miRs 1-14) triggered substantial silencing of HBV RNAs. At the 2 \u03bcg dose, HBVU6#2 reduced the levels of the 3.5 kb HBV RNA by 69.1%. In contrast, all the rationally designed RNAi triggers (with the exception of miR13) showed a greater extent of silencing of the 3.5 kb RNA than HBVU6#2, with eight reaching statistical significance (FIG. 10a, p<0.05 indicated by an asterisk). As expected miRNAs that do not target the 2.4+2.1 kb RNAs did not substantially reduce their levels (FIG. 10b, gray bars, p>0.33-1), while miRNAs that do target them reduced their levels (FIG. 10b black bars).",
                                "Because such a large extent of silencing was observed with some of the HBV miRNAs, it was difficult to determine the relative silencing efficiencies of these constructs. Therefore, silencing was examined as above but at a 0.5 \u03bcg dose (FIG. 10c). HBVU6#2 reduced the levels of the 3.5 kb HBV RNA by 48.8%. miRs 1, 4 and 7 were significantly more potent, silencing the 3.5 kb RNA by 81.2%, 76.7% and 74.8%, respectively (p<0.05). As above, miRs that do not target the 2.4+2.1 kb RNAs (including miR4) did not substantially reduce their levels (data not shown). We next tested the ability of HBVU6#2, miR 1, miR 4 and miR 7 to silence at a fifty-fold lower dose (0.01 \u03bcg). At this dose, the shRNA HBVU6#2 did not silence at all, while our three miRs silenced by approximately 50 (FIG. 10d, p<0.05). Taken together, these data show rational design can lead to the identification of highly potent HBV RNAi triggers."

                                "Two strains of mice are used in this study. The first strain is C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor, Me.). This strain is used to create an animal model of HBV infection for studies assessing the efficacy of chimeric zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) that target HBV DNA. Approximately 348 six week-old female C57BL/6J mice are purchased. Mice are with 3.0\u00d71012-3\u00d71013 viral genomes/mouse of adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding pairs of ZFNs via the tail vein. Four weeks later, these mice are transfected with the HBV genomic plasmid, pTHBV2 and a plasmid encoding the luc gene, using a technique called hydrodynamic transfection, as described in Zhang, G., Budker, V. & Wolff, J. A., \u201cHigh Levels of Foreign Gene Expression in Hepatocytes after Tail Vein Injections of Naked Plasmid DNA,\u201d Hum Gene Ther, 10, 1735-7 (1999) and Liu, F., Song, Y. & Liu, D., \u201cHydrodynamics-Based Transfection in Animals by Systemic Administration of Plasmid DNA,\u201d Gene Ther, 6, 1258-66 (1999). Briefly, plasmids are mixed with 1.8 ml of PBS and injected into the tail vein of mice in 5 seconds. This results in efficient transfection of 5-40% of hepatocytes. Survival with this technique is almost 100% and results in moderate and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Mice are also co-transfected with ZFN expression plasmids and pTHBV2. Mice are periodically removed from the animal facility to measure luc expression levels using a bioluminescence imaging system. Briefly, animals are anesthetized using tribromoethanol. They are given an intraperitoneal injection (IP) of 100 \u03bcl of 30 mg/ml D-luciferin and briefly placed in a Lucite box for imaging as a biosafety precaution. Imaging typically lasts for 10 seconds to 5 min. The luc plasmid may be replaced with a plasmid encoding the secreted serum marker, human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT). In this case, blood samples are collected by retro-orbital bleeding and hAAT levels are measured by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay. At various times (approximately 4-40 days after transfection), mice are euthanized and their liver removed for analysis of HBV DNAs.",

Serum from these mice are used to determine HBV serum surface antigen levels to identify animals that express high levels of HBV proteins and to assess the efficacy of RNAi therapeutics. Only mice that express high levels of HBsAg are used for experiments and the mice that express low levels of HBsAg are sacrificed. High-expressing mice are bred with other high-expressing mice. Mice are infected by tail vein with 3.0\u00d71012-3\u00d71013 viral genomes/mouse of AAV encoding HBV RNAi triggers.
