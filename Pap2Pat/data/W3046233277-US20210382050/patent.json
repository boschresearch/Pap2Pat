                        "Autoimmune diseases are caused by a breakdown in self-tolerance, resulting in an immune response to self-antigens and eventual tissue damage. Autoimmune diseases effect nearly every organ, including the central nervous system (multiple sclerosis), endocrine system (type 1 diabetes), and skin (psoriasis), leading to a total disease prevalence in the United States of approximately 15-24 million patients, a number that is rapidly increasing [1], Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease with a worldwide prevalence of 2.1 million people. MS leads to a severe reduction in quality of life and patients with MS often suffer from paralysis or death, the etiology of which is unknown. Most patients (85%) who eventually develop MS first present with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), exhibiting symptoms commonly associated with demyelination, but do not meet the criteria for MS diagnosis [2], Such patients are simply monitored for further symptomatic demyelinating events.",
                        "Upon developing MS, the patients fall into two main groups: either primary progressive MS (PPMS) (approx. 15%) or relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) (approx. 85%) [3], Patients with PPMS present with multiple sclerosis that never remits, but instead exhibit a steady progression in disability. In contrast, patients with RRMS exhibit disease in which they experience serious clinical symptoms followed by remission and subsequent relapse. In these patients, remission may not fully recover function, resulting in some progression over time, in addition to the risk of transitioning to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which most patients eventually will [4],",
                        "The ability to monitor disease progression of MS and treatment responsiveness using biomarkers has been an elusive goal, because a lack of adequate diagnostic and prognostic information is a major limitation in patient care [5-13], The initial diagnosis of CIS is not enough for a patient to be considered as having MS, because not all CIS patients develop the disease [2,14], This leads to monitoring of the patient for secondary episodes of demyelinating disease symptoms, but precision health approaches could enable the creation of next-generation diagnostics that could be implemented immediately after a CIS to alert physicians that treatment is necessary before full progression to MS. In the case of RRMS (the most frequent type), if disease could adequately be monitored and relapses predicted, drugs could likely intervene to prevent relapse and disease progression to SPMS, providing an opportunity in which a precision prognostic could have a tremendous impact [10,12], Furthermore, many autoimmune diseases (e.g. MS, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis) have an array of treatments that may or may not work for a particular patient, and patients must try many treatments before finding ones that mitigate their symptoms. This means that precision health and personalized medicine approaches that are effective in MS may find applicability in a number of conditions.",
                        "Thus, there is a need in the art for methods of monitoring autoimmune disease progression or regression in a subject, for example, monitoring the stage (e.g., relapse, remission) of the autoimmune disease or monitoring treatment response. There also is a need in the art for methods of detecting or diagnosing an autoimmune disease in a subject, e.g., before disease onset, or diagnosing RRMS vs SPMS vs PPMS."

Without being bound to a particular theory, the niche is representative of the subject's health status with regard to a disease, e.g., an autoimmune disease, or lack thereof. The niche may be biopsied, and the analysis of the biopsied sample allows for the disease diagnosis and/or prognosis, in addition to treatment monitoring. Presented herein are data demonstrating that expression profiles, such as, for example, gene expression profiles, RNA expression profiles, and/or protein expression profiles of cells captured at or biopsied from the niche change as a function of disease progression, e.g., progression from pre-symptomatic disease to symptomatic disease. Data are presented here that additionally support that gene expression profiles, RNA expression profiles, and/or protein expression profiles of cells captured at or biopsied from the niche change as a function of disease regression, e.g., regression achieved by treatment.",

For example, such profiles may be used to monitor a subject before, during or after the onset of the autoimmune disease or to monitor a subject before, during or after relapse of the autoimmune disease. Because the expression profiles represent the subject's status in this regard, the expression profiles may be used to determine a subject's treatment or therapy, e.g., determine a subject's need for treatment or therapy for (onset or relapse of) the autoimmune disease. In related aspects, the expression profiles may also be useful for determining the efficacy of a treatment administered to or performed on a subject receiving such treatment. In yet other related aspects, the expression profiles may be used in methods of preventing or delaying the onset or relapse of the autoimmune disease or reducing the frequency of relapse of the autoimmune disease.",

At Day \u221214, a polymer scaffold comprising polycaprolactone (PCL) was implanted into the subcutaneous space of mice. In some studies, as described below, the procedure was carried out in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice having a Swiss Jim Lambert (SJL) background. The EAE mouse model is a well-known animal model for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). The foreign body response (FBR) to the implanted scaffolds was allowed to normalize in vivo for two weeks. In one study, as described below, disease was induced by immunization of mice with proteolipid protein peptide 139-151 (PLP) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The control group of mice in this study were immunized with an ovalbumin peptide (termed OVA). In another study, as described below, disease was induced with adoptively transferred autoreactive T-cells which recognize PLP. The control group of mice in this study was given autoreactive T-cells which recognize the OVA peptide. The mice were evaluated for symptoms of the disease including body condition and given a clinical score reflective of their coordination and level of paralysis which results from autoimmune-induced damage to neural tissue. As shown by the graph in FIG. 1B, disease symptoms began to show about 7 days after immunization of mice. As shown in FIG. 1B, on Day 7 (represented by the yellow dot), mice were pre-symptomatic (e.g., did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of disease) and thus the clinical score was zero. On Day 9 (represented by the green dot), mice exhibited symptoms and thus the clinical score on this day was about 3.5. In one study, as described below, mice were evaluated on Day 13, instead of Day 9.",

Cells from the polymer scaffold were homogenized with a mechanical dispersing instrument in Trizol reagent. RNA isolation was carried out via centrifugation filter kits that include a DNA enzymatic degradation. Quality and quantity of the RNA was assessed via a Bioanalyzer 2100 and Nanodrop 2000c, respectively. RNA was synthesized into cDNA via reverse transcription, following suggested preparation protocols for high-throughput RT-qPCR using a TaqMan\u00ae OpenArray\u00ae panel. The high-throughput RT-qPCR was carried out using a TaqMan\u00ae OpenArray\u00ae Mouse Inflammation Panel on a QuantStudio\u2122 12K Flex. The OpenArray\u00ae panel analyzes the expression of 648 genes that are associated with immunological pathways. Instrument parameters and quality control was managed by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. Additionally, single tube RT-qPCR was carried out on a subset of genes (determined from the OpenArray results) using Taqman probes to validate the results found using the high-throughput results as well as expand our tests. Gene expressions were normalized to a combination of 5 different housekeeping genes as determined by a house gene stability analysis of the 16 housekeeping genes included in the OpenArray\u00ae panel.",

SVD was an unsupervised algorithm and RF was a trained algorithm. In this manner, a multivariate gene expression signature (GES) capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy was developed. These identified genes comprised the gene expression signature (GES) that could be used for various biological insights and patient monitoring. A variety of graphical outputs, including frequency vs. fold change plots, volcano plots, heatmaps, were generated."

If these events could be detected early, targeted immunotherapy could potentially slow disease progression. We describe the use of engineered biomaterial-based immunological niches amenable to biopsy to provide insights into the phenotype of innate immune cells that control disease activity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Differential gene expression in cells from these niches allowed us to monitor disease dynamics and to gauge the effectiveness of treatment. A proactive treatment regimen given in response to signal within the niche but before symptoms appeared substantially reduced disease. This technology offers a new approach to monitor organ-specific autoimmunity, and it represents a platform to analyze immune dysfunction within otherwise inaccessible target tissues.",
                                "Introduction: Autoimmunity can affect nearly every organ, and these diseases collectively have a prevalence of 15-24 million patients in the United States.1 Treatment of autoimmune disease before irreversible damage occurs represents a substantial clinical opportunity, yet requires improvements in detecting disease activity and in understanding pathogenic mechanisms. For patients already diagnosed with an organ-specific autoimmune disease, the ability to reliably identify an immunological relapse could fundamentally change treatment approaches. Strategically administered pulses of treatment could obviate the need for lifelong immune suppression. The goal of this investigation was to develop a tool to monitor immune dysregulation occurring within target tissues in order to identify relapse onset and to predict its response to therapy.",

Sixty percent of patients with RRMS are unable to walk unassisted within 15 years of diagnosis.2 While a growing arsenal of therapies have been shown to slow relapse rate, new lesion formation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of CNS tissues, and disability progression in people with RRMS, an individual's response to one of these therapies can be highly variable.3 Furthermore, such therapies have to be administered continuously over the long-term and frequently cause adverse effects. Finally, while the MRI shows areas of demyelination, it provides no information regarding the underlying immunopathology. Prior studies have shown divergent patterns of immune cell infiltration within MS lesions, implying that different immunotherapies could exert variable effects in different patients.4,5 Clearly, a full characterization of the pathogenic local immune response within the CNS is the goal, yet remains impossible with current technologies.",

Porous materials implanted subcutaneously induced cell ingrowth and vascularization, with persistent extravasation of immune cells into the newly forming tissue. We hypothesized that these forming immunological tissues with chronic inflammation can serve as a niche with similar cell infiltrates and phenotypes to other inflammatory sites within the host. Moreover, we hypothesized that biopsy of these engineered immunological niches (IN) could detect changes associated with disease activity and could be used to monitor the response to therapy with high reproducibility.",

                                "Microporous poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds were implanted in the subcutaneous space of SJL mice 2 weeks before adoptively transferring either autoreactive or control T-cells (reactive to PLP139-151 or OVA323-339, respectively). Through day 7, no mice had symptoms of disease, yet by day 9, all EAE mice became symptomatic (FIG. 1b). INs were harvested and gene expression analyzed via the OpenArray high-throughput gene expression platform on days 7 and 9 (FIG. 1a). Analysis revealed that of the 632 genes analyzed, 130 were differentially expressed between control and diseased mice (time points pooled, n=8, p<0.05) (FIG. S1). Of genes that were differentially expressed, a combination of fold change (FC), expression stability, and elastic net regularization were used to identify 21 genes, one of which, TREM1, was previously unreported with regards to EAE or MS (FIG. S2). A radar plot of the log2FC for each of the 21 genes indicated similar patterns of expression between INs isolated from pre-symptomatic (d7, yellow) and symptomatic (d9, green) EAE mice that differ from those isolated from control mice (pooled t.p., dashed) (FIG. 1e). Additionally, unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated that control mice and diseased mice cluster separately (FIG. 1d). Collectively, EAE is associated with numerous changes in gene expression at the immunological niches and these changes are detectable before disease symptoms occur.",
                                "We next applied computational approaches to develop a scoring system from the 21 gene signature that could distinguish healthy from diseased mice. Two approaches were employed: an unsupervised dimensionality reduction approach, singular value decomposition (SVD); and a supervised machine learning algorithm, bootstrap aggregated decision tree ensemble (Bagged Tree or BT).6,7 Results of the SVD and BT were similar and in both cases showed significant differences between control and EAE mice, regardless of time point (FIG. S3). These data formed the basis for our trained model for disease classification used throughout the study. A clear separation was observed between INs isolated from diseased and healthy mice by plotting the two scores, (FIG. 1f). The signature scores are predictive of disease onset, as the animals at day 7 had no symptoms, yet a high signature score. The score also predicts disease severity, as indicated by the area of each data point in FIG. 1e. An in-house qPCR panel confirmed the OpenArray results and was employed throughout the study (FIG. S5).",

                                "Cell populations within the INs were subsequently investigated using a panel of eight immune (CD45+) cells commonly involved in EAE.8 Cells as a percentage of live CD45+ cells were measured, with substantial similarity between healthy and diseased mice, and only minor differences in CD4+ T cells at day 7, CD8+ T cells at day 9, and CD4+ T cells and NK cells at day 21 (FIG. 1c and S6). Collectively, the large changes in gene expression observed at the IN with disease were likely due to alterations in cell phenotypes within inflammatory microenvironments, rather than cell trafficking. The preponderance of CD45+ cells within the INs are innate immune cells, which are recruited to the CNS during EAE initiation and progression and contribute to damaging the tissue.9-12 The IN may be sampling the phenotypic alterations of innate immune cells that extravasate into inflammatory environments during disease.",
                                "We tested the hypothesis that the phenotypic alterations captured by analysis of the engineered tissue represent local responses within a tissue that are not captured by analysis of blood. Over the last two decades, numerous studies have examined differential gene expression in the blood of patients with MS and healthy controls.13-17 Although blood is a rich source of cells, most of these cells are not relevant to the immune responses occurring within the CNS, which may explain why the overall changes between diseased and healthy are modest and why at least half of differentially expressed genes have few ties to MS pathophysiology. The analysis of blood harvested from symptomatic EAE mice or OVA controls (d10) indicated that the mean expression of signature genes in the blood does not mirror that from the IN, suggesting that INs and blood provide distinct information (FIG. 1h). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was unable to cluster diseased from healthy mice based on blood data (FIG. 1g); in fact, approximately 18% of samples did not have a valid reading from the blood, with some, such as Ereg, undetectable in most samples.",

                                "We next investigated the capacity of the IN to monitor disease dynamics that are associated with remission and relapse. Disease was induced by adoptive transfer (cells reactive to PLP139-151 or OVA323-339) and allowed to progress towards symptomatic remission before IN biopsy at day 21, and relapse was initiated by a second adoptive transfer of cells on day 23 reactive to another immunodominant epitope that simulates epitope spreading during relapse18 (either PLP178-191 or OVA257-264). The second IN was biopsied at day 28 (relapse) (schematic and clustergram, FIG. S7). Radar plots demonstrated that the log 2 FC of the 21 signature genes at the remission time point were similar to control (FIG. 2a). During disease relapse, the genes exhibited similar expression to disease onset (FIG. 2b). When analyzed via the trained model, INs from relapsing mice demonstrated high BT and SVD scores, whereas those from animals in remission were similar to control mice (data normalized to time matched controls) (FIG. 2d-f). Signature scores are dynamic and predict disease state, as demonstrated by the finding that only the remission time point demonstrated significantly different scores from the symptomatic onset scores. ROC curves were plotted to determine the diagnostic ability of the system (FIG. S10) and demonstrated an AUC of 0.98-1 (depending on metric: SVD, BT, or combined) (95% CI 0.94-1.03) for the training set, and an AUC of 0.81-0.90 95% CI 0.59-1.06) for distinguishing remission and relapse samples, validating the diagnostic efficacy of the signature score derived from INs in diagnosing and prognosing EAE. Collectively, this system offers the opportunity for a patient to be alerted of impending relapse, which would enable pharmacologic intervention to prevent or reduce severity of relapses.",
                                "We sought to test the ability of the implantable INs to monitor the response to therapy. We have previously reported nanoparticles to induce tolerance in these and similar models, which were employed here as a model treatment.19-21 Similarly to previous studies, IN-implanted mice received an adoptive transfer of T cells, yet were also injected intravenously with 2.5 mg of antigen encapsulating PLG nanoparticles 2 days post-transfer. Three groups were used: a control group (OVA reactive T-cells and PLP particles), an effective treatment group (PLP reactive T-cells with PLP particles), and an ineffective treatment group (PLP reactive T-cells and OVA particles). INs were biopsied on day 9 and analyzed for the gene signature, which indicated that the effective treatment group had similar signature score and clinical score as the control group. However, the ineffective treatment group had significantly higher signature and clinical scores relative to the control (FIG. 3a,b and S8). The pattern of gene expression in the mice receiving ineffective treatment was similar to the untreated mice during disease onset. To estimate the diagnostic efficacy for treatment monitoring, ROC curves of SVD, BT, and a combined metric were created with AUC values of 0.97-1 (95% CI 0.89-1.06), suggesting a highly effective treatment monitoring tool (FIG. S10).",

We induced EAE and biopsied INs for analysis seven days post-transfer, before delivering therapies: either a single i.v. dose of 2.5 mg of antigen encapsulating PLG nanoparticles (described below) or a daily i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg dexamethasone. In either case, the IN alerted to immune dysfunction that differed from healthy and enabled pre-emptive interventions to reduce clinical symptoms and prevent disease onset (FIG. 3 c and S9).",

                                "We developed an implantable IN that forms a vascularized inflammatory tissue that is dynamic with the status of the immune system. This finding is well supported by reports demonstrating that inflammation surrounding implants is altered by systemic changes associated with various physiological and pathological states, including diabetes, obesity, and advanced age.22-24 This implantable biopsy site thus harnesses the host immune system to identify immunological changes within innate immune cells of tissues, which contribute to disease initiation and progression. We identified 21 molecular targets that are differentially expressed at the IN in diseased animals that represent onset or relapse of EAE or MS, enabling interventions to prevent disease development before damage occurs. Furthermore, the molecular details gleaned from biopsy of the IN enables pre-emptive treatment, a strategy which could be transformative in treating RRMS patients before relapses occur, with the potential to prevent disease altogether.",
                                "In addition to aiding in patient monitoring, the IN is a tool that can provide molecular information on the dysfunctional immune cells within inflamed tissues, and may enable a precision medicine approach for improved subtyping of MS and provide indicators for factors associated with progression.25 Multiple pathological features can underpin MS in different patients, yet, at present, identifying the sub-types can only occur post-mortem. With this IN, molecular information about responses within the tissue could be used to screen individual patients and correlate responses to disease outcomes in addition to therapeutic responses, to enhance prognosis. In contrast to blood glucose monitors for Type 1 Diabetes that monitor treatment of established disease, this immunological niche sets the stage for an implantable molecular sensor that continuously reports on the functional status of the immune system to inform disease onset, prognosis, and treatment monitoring.",
