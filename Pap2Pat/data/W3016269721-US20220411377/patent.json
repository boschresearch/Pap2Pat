                        "The field of the invention relates to compounds that inhibit the biological activity of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). In particular, the field of the invention relates to compounds that selectively inhibit nitric oxide synthases such as human neuronal NOS (nNOS).",
                        "NO is a highly reactive free radical produced by the hemethiolate monooxygenase nitric oxide synthase (NOS, mNOS=mammalian NOS). NOS generates NO by oxidizing L-Arg and is found in mammals. mNOS is a multi-domain protein composed of both oxygenase and reductase domains. X-ray crystal structures determined mNOS oxygenase domains reveals a near identical tertiary structure and active site. N-terminal fragment that contains the Zn2+ binding motif is observed in mNOS.",
                        "In mammalian systems, NO functions as an essential signaling molecule and is involved in a variety of physiological functions ranging from blood pressure homeostasis to neural cell communication and host defense. There are three mNOS isoforms: endothelial NOS (eNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS). Owing to the pathological consequences of the over or under production of NO, significant effort has been made toward the development and characterization of isoform selective mNOS inhibitors, which has resulted in the development of many unique inhibitors.",
                        "Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine to L-citrulline in the central nervous system, generating nitric oxide (NO), a critical neurotransmitter. Significant research has implicated the overexpression of nNOS and overproduction of NO in various neurological diseases, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases, as well as neuronal damage due to stroke, cerebral palsy and migraine headaches. Inhibiting endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is, however, undesirable, because these isozymes are responsible for maintaining crucial body function. Thus, selective inhibition of nNOS over its closely related isoforms, eNOS and iNOS, can provide a promising strategy in developing therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
                        "Many organic scaffolds have been investigated over the past decade. However, most inhibitor compounds investigated to datye are mimics of the natural substrate of nNOS, the amino acid L-argine. Such compound are basic and highly charge under physiological conditions, adversely affecting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation. In addition, useful nNOS inhibitors should exhibit selectivity for nNOS over the iNOS and eNOS to avoid unintended negative side effects. Yet some compounds, while promising, are limited by synthetic challenge and/or low yield. As a result, there remains an on-going concern in the art to provide an efficient approach toward a facile synthesis of a wide range of such nNOS inhibitors, with structures optimized for enhanced pharmacological effect"

                                "Inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, is an attractive strategy for treating or preventing these diseases. We previously developed several classes of 2-aminoquinoline-based nNOS inhibitors, but these compounds had drawbacks including off-target promiscuity, low activity against human nNOS, and only modest selectivity for nNOS over related enzymes. In this study, we synthesized new nNOS inhibitors based on 7-phenyl-2-aminoquinoline and assayed them against rat and human nNOS, human eNOS, and murine and (in some cases) human iNOS. Compounds with a meta-relationship between the aminoquinoline and a positively charged tail moiety were potent and had up to nearly 900-fold selectivity for human nNOS over human eNOS. X-ray crystallography indicates that the amino groups of some compounds occupy a water-filled pocket surrounding an nNOS-specific aspartate residue (absent in eNOS). This interaction was confirmed by mutagenesis studies, making 7-phenyl-2-aminoquinolines the first aminoquinolines to interact with this residue.",
                                "**INTRODUCTION**",
                                "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the gradual loss of neuronal integrity and are responsible for a wide range of neurological deficiencies. Neuronal damage or death associated with stroke, ischemic events, and cerebral palsy (as well as acute or chronic brain injuries) has also been linked to similarly debilitating motor, cognitive, and psychological impairments. The overproduction of the vital secondary messenger nitric oxide (NO), produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in tissues of the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), is directly implicated in these disorders.1,2 Because NO plays a key role in these diseases, rational control of NO levels in neuronal tissues via nNOS-specific inhibition is therapeutically desirable.",
                                "Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) are a family of homodimeric enzymes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of NO. Functional regulation of NO is differentiated by subcellular localization, tissue distribution, and regulatory gene expression of three isoforms of NOS: endothelial NOS (eNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS), which are responsible for regulating blood pressure and vascular tone, immune activation, and normal neuronal communication, respectively.3 Functional NOS is a homodimer. Each NOS monomer contains a reductase domain and an oxygenase domain, separated by a flexible region where calmodulin binds when activated by calcium ions. The reductase domain contains binding sites for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), whereas the oxygenase domain contains binding sites for (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), the metallocofactor heme, and the substrate L-arginine. Electron flow proceeds from one monomer's reductase domain, sequentially through NADPH, FAD, and FMN, to the opposite monomer's oxygenase domain, where the electron is transferred between FMN and heme, by which L-arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline and NO.4",
                                "Most compounds initially investigated for nNOS inhibition were designed as competitive mimics of L-arginine. These inhibitors have high basicity and polarity, a large total polar surface area (tPSA), and an overabundance of hydrogen bond donors, and as a result, suffer from poor bioavailability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability. Furthermore, many promising L-arginine-mimetic inhibitors are not nNOS-selective, owing to the high sequence similarity and nearly identical active-site architecture between the three NOS isoforms. High nNOS selectivity is crucial; non-selective inhibitors have the potential for dangerous side effects. For example, iNOS inhibition could impair immune system activation, while eNOS inhibition can lead to severe hypertension or other cardiovascular complications.5",
                                "We have been investigating 2-aminoquinoline-based scaffolds as isoform-selective arginine bioisosteres with more favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Since 2014, we have reported several generations of aminoquinolines that are modestly potent and selective towards nNOS (FIG. 1). The first generation of aminoquinolines (such as 16), were found to be potent and selective nNOS inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetics. Unfortunately, 1 was found to have high rat nNOS (rnNOS) over human nNOS (hnNOS) selectivity, low selectivity for hnNOS over human eNOS (heNOS), and caused toxic side effects, possibly because of its off-target promiscuity.Error! Bookmark not defined. The second generation of NOS inhibitors, (e. g., phenyl ether 27) reduced off-target binding while preserving potency and selectivity against rnNOS. However, these compounds suffered from decreased Caco-2 permeability, low hnNOS activity, and similarly low hn/heNOS selectivity. Newer generation inhibitors, such as 3 and 4, improved upon their respective parent series by incorporating elements such as the quinoline 4-methyl group and cyano-containing tail moieties.8,9 These compounds have greatly enhanced hnNOS potency, hn/heNOS selectivity, and improved cellular permeability and off-target profiles.",
                                "Because of some of the drawbacks associated with previous inhibitor generations, we have been investigating alternative aminoquinoline-containing scaffolds. Interestingly, the 7-phenylquinoline compound 5 appears in the literature as part of a Glaxo-SmithKline screening library and was recently employed in several high-throughput screening studies.10,11 There are no articles, patents, or other reports of what research program this compound may have belonged to originally, but it appears to now be part of an \u201copen source\u201d drug discovery program.",
                                "Because of its distinctively nNOS inhibitor-like structure, but with fewer rotatable bonds than earlier studies, a docking study with 5 in a nNOS crystal structure was conducted. Consequently, 5 was predicted to bind in an nNOS inhibitor-like mode, in which the aminoquinoline forms a salt-bridge with Glu592/Glu597 (rnNOS/hnNOS) and the phenethylamine tail portion faces out toward the regions of the active site. To this end, lead compound 5 and related compounds 6-9 (modified at the amine portion (FIG. 2) were designed, synthesized, and assayed against purified NOS isoforms to test the hypothesis that 5 and analogues could act as nNOS inhibitors. Satisfyingly, these compounds possessed encouraging nNOS inhibitory activity and good isoform selectivity, and we chose to undertake a more thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. First, we investigated whether meta- or ortho-substitution of the central phenyl ring (compounds 10-13) might be more effective than the para-substitution of the parent compound. This early optimization revealed that meta-substituted analogue 12 displayed good inhibitory potency against rat and human nNOS, excellent hn/heNOS selectivity and n/i selectivity, as well as good solubility and desirable properties (few rotatable bonds and low tPSA).",
                                "Encouraged by both the inhibitory constants and the agreement between X-ray crystallography and our docking results (data not shown), 12 was used as a launching point for further optimization. We developed a set of compounds with modifications made at the 5-position of the central phenyl ring (e.g., nitrile 14 and pyridine 15) to investigate whether additional interactions could be made with the heme propionate or another active site residue.",
                                "Because of 12's high n/eNOS selectivity, we hypothesized that the flexible tail amino group might be contacting (directly or otherwise) a specific aspartate residue (Asp597/Asp602 in rnNOS/hnNOS, respectively). This residue is missing in eNOS isoforms, replaced by asparagine. Consequently, contact (H-bonding or electrostatic) between an inhibitor and this residue can impart very high n/eNOS selectivity (1000-fold or more). We hypothesized that a second set of compounds could be designed to solidify any existing contacts with Asp597/Asp602 by incorporating the tail amino group functionality into a rigid ring system, thereby reducing its overall flexibility and locking the interaction in place.

Many Suzuki conditions were screened for the coupling of 39 and 41, but the strong protic bases usually required for reductive elimination and activation of 39 often led to deacetylation of the quinoline and decomposition. The use of NaHCO3 as the base13 in a mixed aqueous solvent was more successful, and microwave irradiation of this mixture yielded phenylquinoline 42 within 25 minutes at 120\u00b0 C. without substantial deacetylation. The intermediate protected phenylquinolines were not extensively characterized but were isolated and immediately deprotected.

Table 1 summarizes the apparent Ki values and isoform selectivities for 5-37. Values for compounds 1-4 are included for comparison. The rnNOS and miNOS isoforms were used to approximate n/i isoform selectivity because they are the easiest to express and purify, and those are the species used for crystallography. Furthermore, for preclinical purposes, it is essential to prove efficacy and selectivity in lower animals prior to advancement to clinical trials. Recent advances have made it possible to obtain and crystallize both hnNOS and heNOS, which were used to support our human isoform SAR development. Because high-resolution structures of murine or human iNOS with inhibitors bound are still not readily available, the majority of the structural discussion will focus on nNOS and eNOS; discussion of a comparison between murine and human iNOS inhibition follows that.",
                                "Initial Inhibitory and Structural Analysis of Modified Amine Tail Analogues. The initial lead, 7-phenyl-2-aminoquinoline (5), has good rat and human nNOS inhibitory activity (105 nM and 122 nM, respectively) with moderately high n/iNOS and n/eNOS selectivity of 207-fold and 191-fold, respectively. The X-ray crystal structure of 5 bound to rnNOS, hnNOS, and heNOS revealed the structural basis for inhibitory potency (data not shown). The quinoline portion of 5 mimics arginine and forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond system with the main chain carbonyl of Trp587/Trp592 (rnNOS/hnNOS) and the side chain carboxylate of Glu592/Glu602 (rnNOS/hnNOS). This is identical to the structural details observed for other nNOS inhibitors possessing the aminoquinoline functionality.6-9 All three crystal structures clearly reveal that the central phenyl ring sits between heme propionates A and D. In the hnNOS-5 structure, the tail phenethylamine moiety makes a direct H-bond interaction with the H4B and propionate A, displacing the water there, while the rnNOS-5 structure only makes H-bonding contacts with the carbonyl of the H4B and is unable to displace the water molecule bridging propionate A and the H4B.",
                                "In heNOS there are two molecules of 5 bound. Ligand A binds as expected in the active site and is very similar to the nNOS structures, while Ligand B displaces H4B with the aminoquinoline positioned in the pterin binding pocket. As a result, the tail ethylamine of 5 bound to heNOS is oriented in the opposite direction to what we observed in the nNOS structures, and instead interacts with propionate D. Ligand B is stabilized by aromatic stacking interactions with both Trp447 as well as Trp74 and Phe460 from the opposite chain at the dimer interface. Two-site binding is not unique to 5 and has been observed in several NOS-inhibitor structures.20,21 In all four molecules of the asymmetric unit of heNOS, the aminoquinoline and phenyl rings of 5 are clearly defined. The electron density is weaker for the tail ethylamines, with slightly more density observed near propionate D, indicating a potential interaction with the heme propionate. Interestingly, the ability of 5 and other compounds to bind in both sites has little correlation with inhibitory potency, indicating active site binding, but not the ability to displace the H4B, determines potency.",
                                "With the goal of improving hnNOS activity and isoform selectivity, we made efforts to optimize the conformational positioning of the tail amine of 5. To this end, homologation, chain shortening, and isomerization of lead molecule 5 resulted in compounds 6-13. Methylation of the tail nitrogen atom of 5 (compound 6) resulted in over a 2-fold loss in rnNOS activity, while shortening the ethylene linker between the central ring and the terminal nitrogen atom by one carbon (compound 7) resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in rnNOS activity. Moreover, 7 showed increased hnNOS inhibitory activity, as well as improvements in both rn/miNOS and hn/heNOS selectivity ratios, relative to parent molecule 5. The X-ray crystal structures of 7 bound to rnNOS and hnNOS reveal well-defined density at the aminoquinoline and central ring regions that closely overlaps with lead 5 (data not shown). However, the orientation of the tail aminomethyl group in both structures could not be determined because of poor density, even at a low contour levels, suggesting free rotation of the aminomethyl occurs toward either propionate A and the H4B site water or toward propionate D and Tyr706/Tyr711 (rnNOS/hnNOS) (data not shown). In both nNOS structures, the position of the central phenyl ring of 7 forces heme propionate D into a downward conformation. As observed for 5 and 6, methylation of the tail nitrogen atom of 7 to yield 8 again resulted in a loss of potency against both rat and human nNOS, suggesting that a primary amino group at this position is important for achieving maximal inhibitory activity against nNOS isoforms.",

For example, phenyl ether compounds with one methylene between the amino group and the aryl ring (benzyl) are more potent and selective than those with two or more methylenes (phenethyl), and the same trend is observed here (cf. 7 and 8 vs. 5 and 6). Likewise, compound 9 (Ki (rnNOS)=140 nM) has slightly less potency than 7. Nonetheless, other parts of the SAR are distinct from the previous generation of aminoquinoline NOS inhibitors; for instance, N-methylated compounds (6, 8) appear less potent than the desmethyl analogues (5, 7). This appears to be the reverse of what was generally observed for benzyl and phenethyl ether compounds.",
                                "The o-substituted isomers (11 and 10) were shown to possess less inhibitory potency (11, Ki (rnNOS)=935 nM; 10, Ki (rnNOS)=119 nM) than their corresponding para-substituted derivatives 5 and 7, respectively. Furthermore, 10 displays a similar loss in hnNOS potency and a sharp decrease in rn/miNOS selectivity. However, poor binding affinity with heNOS (10, Ki (heNOS)=41,900 nM) results in a gain in hnNOS selectivity over heNOS compared to 7. In contrast to the o-substituted isomers, m-substituted isomers 13 and 12 exhibited comparable potencies to 5 and 7, respectively [13, Ki (rnNOS)=107 nM; 12, Ki (rnNOS)=55 nM]. Moreover, 12 also has very good nNOS selectivity over iNOS (rn/miNOS=440) and outstanding selectivity over eNOS (hn/heNOS=877). The kinetic data for 12 suggests that placing the aminoalkyl tail portion meta- to the quinoline favors binding to the human nNOS isoform, which prompted us to check the crystal structures of both rnNOS-12 and hnNOS-12. In X-ray crystal structures, we observed that the tail amino group in the meta-position of the benzene ring may participate in maximal binding interactions with a water-filled polar pocket made up by the carboxylate of propionate A, the side chains of G1n478/G1n483, Arg481/Arg486, and, most notably, Asp597/Asp602 (rnNOS/hnNOS, respectively), resulting in reduced flexibility in the tail aminomethyl group (data not shown).",
                                "In sharp contrast, we observed that the tail aminomethyl group in the heNOS-12 structure shows a different orientation, making H-bonds with heme propionate A (data not shown). It is important to note that there is a major difference in the active site of human eNOS, namely, Asn366 replaces Asp597/Asp602 (rnNOS/hnNOS) in the polar pocket noted for nNOS. In earlier studies we found that this Asp/Asn difference makes substantial contributions to isoform selectivity.23 This is likely the basis for the high selectivity observed for 12 because the aminomethyl group is oriented back toward Asp597/Asp602 in the rnNOS/hnNOS structures.",
                                "We proposed that homologated analogue 13 could have improved activity because the longer chain might allowed it to potentially displace one of the structural waters near the nNOS-specific Asp residue. However, the nNOS inhibitory activity of 13 is weaker, comparable to para-substituted derivative 5 (and about two-fold lower than 12), indicating that either (a) this water molecule is not displaced, or (b) any energy gained from water displacement does not offset entropic costs of chain elongation, internal torsion, or other negative interactions between the enzyme and inhibitor. The crystal structures of rnNOS-13 and hnNOS-13 supports the former hypothesis (data not shown); the tail amino group does not occupy this polar pocket but rather displaces the water molecule bridging propionate A and the H4B. Consequently, the aminoethyl group can only reach the closer heme propionate A for an electrostatic interaction, rather than the farther Asp597/Asp602 site (rnNOS/hnNOS).",
                                "Previously, installation of a nitrile at the 5-position of phenyl ether-linked aminoquinolines greatly improved potency, as the nitrile fit into a small, previously undiscovered auxiliary pocket, where it formed a H-bond with a deep structural water and stabilized binding;Error!

Examination of the crystal structure of 12 indicated that the 5-position nitrile of the more compact and rigid phenylquinoline (compared to the more flexible phenyl ether molecule) cannot reach this auxiliary pocket (data not shown). Instead, the position of the phenyl ring of 14 (just like 12) would force heme propionate D into a downward conformation; thus, the 5-position nitrile would cause serious clashes with nearby residues.

To this end, 19-29, having a variety of steric, electronic, and H-bonding properties that could yield crucial SAR information, were prepared and assayed for NOS inhibitory potency. In general, small substituent modifications at the 4-position of lead 12, such as fluorine (19), chlorine (20), ethyl (22), and methoxyl (23) do not add additional good contacts in the rat nNOS active site, resulting in a loss in potency. Compound 21 is a less potent inhibitor given that the trifluoromethyl group of 21 is likely too bulky to fit. However, changing the 4-position methoxyl group (23) to an ethoxyl group (24) restored the potency in rnNOS. The crystal structure of 24 bound to rnNOS shows strong density for the aminoquinoline and central phenyl ring as seen in parent compound 12 (data not shown). While the aminomethyl moiety occupies the water site between H4B and propionate A, the ethoxyl moiety is large enough to establish some contacts with Met336.

The aminomethyl moiety interacts with Asn574 and the ethoxyl group still can reach Met341 for contact (data not shown). It might be the polar nature of His342 that pushes the ethoxyl group away and cause the central phenyl ring to flip. The binding mode of 24 in heNOS is almost identical to that observed in rnNOS (data not shown). The better nonbonded contacts between the ethoxyl moiety of 24 and the bulky Phe105 side chain makes the inhibitor more ordered in structure and leads to rather low n/e selectivity (164-fold).",

                                "A further improvement for rnNOS inhibition was observed by the addition of a small cycloalkyl group (28 and 29). The addition of a cyclobutyl tail moiety allows 28 to form van der Waals interactions in the Met336-Leu337-Tyr706 pocket ((data not shown)), resulting in good potency with rnNOS (Ki (rnNOS)=49 nM). The slightly less bulky cyclopropane analogue 29 was found to have even greater rnNOS potency [Ki (rnNOS)=39 nM], making it the most potent rnNOS inhibitor in the entire series. The X-ray crystal structure of 29 bound to rnNOS reveals that the tail cyclobutane ring fits nicely into the hydrophobic pocket surrounded by Met336, Leu337, and Tyr706 pocket, with the side chain of Tyr706 occupying two alternate conformations (data not shown). Propionate D is pushed by 29 into the downward conformation. However, the orientation of the aminomethyl group shown two alternate directions that form H-bonds with either the H4B site water or the side chain of Arg481 via water bridging (data not shown).

Similar to the binding mode found in the rnNOS-29 structure, the central phenyl ring of 29 bound to hnNOS presses into heme propionate D. The polar nature of His342 forces the tail cyclopropyl group to move away from the imidazole side chain, making contacts with Met341 instead. The binding conformation of the tail cyclopropyl group closely overlaps with the tail cyclobutyl group of 28 in the hnNOS-28 structure, suggesting the placement of the aminomethyl substituent gives rise to the difference in hnNOS activity between 28 and 29. In hnNOS-29, the density for the aminomethyl group is weak in one chain but visible in the other, which indicates that the central phenyl ring is flipped compared to that seen in hnNOS-28 (data not shown), so the aminomethyl group of 29 points to water near G1n483, which is very similar to the binding conformation of the aminomethyl moiety of 12 bound to hnNOS. The positive ammonium group of 29 faces a water-filled pocket noted above for 12 that is influenced by the negative charge of Asp602. In heNOS, again the bulky Phe105 pushes the cyclopropyl group toward heme propionate A, allowing the aminomethyl moiety to make H-bonds with both the propionate and H4B. The aminomethyl group would not point to the water-filled pocket because there is no negatively charged residue lining the pocket in heNOS. Rather, Asn366 is part of this pocket and is very likely the origin of the 457-fold hn/heNOS selectivity for this compound.",

Aryl substituents are also tolerated; for example, compound 30, with its bulky 3-fluorobenzyl group to the 4-position, is only slightly less potent than 24, although it is considerably less potent than an aminopyridine-pyrrolidine compound (18 nM) after which it is modeled.25 A similar trend is observed with the benzonitrile ring of 31; previously, 4-cyanoaryl compounds had good hnNOS activity, but lower hn/heNOS selectivity (generally around 30-fold),Error! Bookmark not defined. but in this phenylquinoline scaffold, the hn/heNOS selectivity is higher with the 4-cyanoaryl group present. However, the hn/heNOS selectivity of 31 remains inferior to leads 5, 12, and 24 as a result of increased binding to heNOS (8300 nM). The unusual binding behavior of 31 is discussed in the Supporting Information.",
                                "Given the low hn/heNOS selectivity for 31, as well as the disfavored binding to the human nNOS active site, we decided to reduce the overall length of the inhibitors to better fit into the hnNOS active site, while maintaining H-bond accepting capability in the tail ring. The 2- and 3-pyridinylmethyl ether groups of 32 and 33, respectively, were introduced to provide synergistic contact with either Leu337 in rnNOS or His342 in hnNOS. Relative to 12, both pyridinyl modifications provide slight improvements in rnNOS potency (32, Ki=52 nM; 33, Ki=44 nM). The crystal structure rnNOS-32 with compound 33 overlaid shows nearly identical binding positions for the aminoquinoline and tail pyridine, with the pyridinyl nitrogen facing away from Leu337 in both cases (to allow hydrophobic interactions) (data not shown). The difference lies in the orientation of the central phenyl ring. As a result, the central-ring aminomethyl group of 33 displaces the H4B site water, whereas this moiety points away from the existing water in 32.",
                                "In the hnNOS-32 structure, the overall binding remains largely the same, although the orientation of the middle phenyl ring is different in the two nNOS cases (data not shown). Here, the ring does not press sufficiently against heme propionate D so that the latter is not distorted as seen in the rnNOS-32 structure. The differences might be the result of the Leu337 (rat) and His342 (human) variation, where the bulkier His342 side chain in human nNOS pushes the tail pyridine of 32 away so that the central phenyl does not make such close contacts with the heme propionate D. Because of the 2-position of the pyridine nitrogen atom, a H-bond with the His342 side chain is not possible. Additionally, the position of the aminomethyl group on the phenyl ring has some uncertainty, although some weak electron densities support a likely interaction with Asn574. These deleterious interactions lead to a decreased binding affinity of 32 to hnNOS (Ki=76 nM). However, by virtue of substantially diminished binding potency towards miNOS and heNOS, the rn/miNOS and hn/heNOS selectivities of 32 remain quite high (rn/miNOS=879, hn/heNOS=312).",
                                "Compound 32 is unique in that previously reported aminoquinolines substituted with pyridines3 generally had only 10-20-fold n/eNOS selectivity. However, 32 exhibits fairly good hn/heNOS selectivity (312-fold). The main difference is that in the heNOS-32 crystal structure the orientation of the central phenyl ring is perpendicular to the aminoquinoline ring rather than parallel as in hnNOS-32 (data not shown). As a result, the amino group of 32 in heNOS is about 2 \u212b farther from heme propionate D than it is in hnNOS-32. In addition, the amino group in hnNOS-32 H-bonds with Asn574. These interactions are possible reasons for the good hn/heNOS selectivity.",
                                "The 3-pyridylmethyl ether of 33 moderately increases hnNOS potency (Ki=45 nM for 33 vs 60 nM for 12). This is not the first instance where the 3-pyridyl moiety has improved binding to both hnNOS,Error! Bookmark not defined.,26 although it is the first example where such a compound has equal potency for both the rat and human enzymes. The hnNOS-33 X-ray structure shows good density for the aminoquinoline and central phenyl rings (data not shown). The tail pyridine portion show signs of disorder but, a potential H-bond between the pyridine and His342 is more feasible for 33 than for 32. In the rnNOS-33 structure, however, the hydrophobic portion of the pyridine reach the nonpolar residues Leu337 and Met336, suggesting that the pyridine can be either a hydrophobic or a H-bonding moiety depending on to which nNOS isoform it is bound (data not shown). The aminomethyl moiety of 33 still interacts with Asn574 of hnNOS (data not shown), while in rnNOS-33, it makes an electrostatic interaction with heme propionate A (data not shown). Both interactions are favorable, and the results taken together may suggest a reason for equal potency against rat and human enzymes.",
                                "In heNOS-33 the aminomethyl moiety is able to H-bond with heme propionate (data not shown), rather than pointing out toward G1n247 as in the case of 32 (data not shown). How could a simple difference in the pyridinyl nitrogen atom position make such a large difference? The pyridine ring nitrogen atom of 33 can make an extra H-bond with a water molecule next to the H4B, which pulls the inhibitor closer to heme propionate A and results in better interactions. This may explain the 3-fold improvement in binding affinity of 33 (7700 nM) versus 32 (23,700 nM) toward heNOS, which leads to poorer n/eNOS selectivity for 33 (172-fold).",
                                "The incorporation of heterocyclic H-bond acceptors leads to favorable increases in both potency and selectivity. Utilizing heterocyclic tail moieties with the dual ability to form hydrophobic interactions with Leu337 in rnNOS, while also forming H-bonding interactions with isoform-specific His342 in hnNOS, may be advantageous for future in vivo studies (where activity in rats is necessary). Considering the importance of the heterocycle, we also sought to exchange the bulkier pyridine for smaller heterocycles (34-37). These compounds all demonstrated high potencies against rnNOS, with Ki values all below 60 nM.",
                                "The use of isoxazole (34) resulted in lost activity against hnNOS. However, 4-(methyloxy)-1,3-thiazole (35) resulted in a Ki of 31 nM against hnNOS, making 35 the most potent hnNOS inhibitor in the entire series. Comparing the X-ray crystal structures of rnNOS-35 and hnNOS-35 reveals a common binding orientation of the aminoquinoline ring but with differences in the central phenyl ring resulting from different interactions between the thiazole and the enzyme (data not shown). In the rnNOS structure, the thiazole ring is positioned near Leu337 with its carbon atom making the closest contact. In hnNOS-35, the thiazole is near His342 with its S atom facing toward His342 and its N atom H-bonding with a water molecule. The bulkier His342 in hnNOS pushes 35 slightly farther away from the heme than its position in rnNOS. Therefore, the aminomethyl moiety on the central phenyl ring in hnNOS H-bonds with Asn574, whereas the same moiety points toward G1n478 in rnNOS, and the phenyl ring flips almost 180\u00b0. Unfortunately, single digit micromolar inhibitory activity of 35 against miNOS and heNOS results in low rn/mi and hn/heNOS selectivities relative to 32.",
                                "The use of oxazole (36) results in a slight loss in hnNOS potency (Ki=63 nM). However, reduced inhibitory activity against miNOS and heNOS led to excellent selectivities (rn/miNOS=382, hn/heNOS=433).",
                                "Human iNOS Inhibition Study. Recently, we successfully expressed and purified human iNOS proteinError! Bookmark not defined. that showed robust activity. Human iNOS (hiNOS) assay data were collected for eight compounds, including the three simple aminomethyl compounds 7, 10, and 12, as well as a sampling of the more potent compounds from the latter series (29, 32, 36, and 37) to determine the SAR for the human system. Ki values obtained from rat and human nNOS, as well as murine and human iNOS, were used to approximate the cross-species selectivity between lower- (rn/mi) and higher-order species (hn/hi) (vide infra). The major difference between murine and human iNOS that might affect inhibitor binding is that Asn115 in miNOS is Thr121 in hiNOS. The tail part of many inhibitors might reach the site based on observations in the available nNOS and eNOS structures. Without an iNOS-inhibitor structure, we can only speculate on potential interactions by superimposing the iNOS structures onto the known nNOS-inhibitor structures.",
                                "The general inhibition trends in Table 2 are more or less consistent (<2-fold) between murine and human iNOS, with only 7 and 33 as the principal exceptions. Compound 7 is a compact inhibitor that would make only weak contacts with the Asn115/Thr121 (miNOS/hiNOS) site. The twofold difference in binding affinity might result from the variation in a water-mediated H-bonding network or another unknown reason. Contrarily, overlaying the structure of miNOS or hiNOS on hnNOS-33 reveals that the pyridine nitrogen atom of 33 is capable of making a direct H-bond with either Asn115 or Thr121 (data not shown). The three-fold weaker binding affinity to hiNOS might indicate a weaker interaction with Thr121 in hiNOS (than with Asn115 in miNOS). In the same overlay, another variation site, Ser256/Ala262 (miNOS/hiNOS), is more than 5.0 \u212b from the potential position of the aminomethyl moiety of 33, likely too far away to influence inhibitor binding.",
                                "Directed Mutagenesis Supports Water-Mediated Interaction of Inhibitors with Asp597. Previous studies indicated that Asp597 in rnNOS electrostatically stabilizes cationic inhibitors and can account for much of the selectivity for nNOS over eNOW (as this residue is Asn in heNOS). A second difference, Met336 in rnNOS (Val in heNOS), can provide better nonpolar contacts with inhibitors and impart selectivity. To test the importance of these differences further, we determined the Ki values for certain compounds against various rnNOS mutants (Table 3).",
                                "All tested compounds exhibited decreased potency against the single-mutant enzyme (D597N) (perhaps, as expected), but against the double mutant, all compounds had potency comparable to the single mutant (except for 12, where it was greatly reduced). Compound 36 actually displayed 5-fold increased potency against the double mutant (versus the single mutant). The rnNOS-36 structure shows that the tail end of the inhibitor contacts Met336 and Leu337. These two residues are Val104 and Phe105 in heNOS, and contacts made with the tail end of the inhibitor may involve more than the Met/Val difference. It is possible that the local environment near the Val336 and Leu337 residues in the M336V/D597N double mutant enables better contacts with the tail end of the inhibitor than the same area in the D597N single mutant does, thus improving the potency against the double mutant versus the single mutant. This trend is reflected in the behaviors of 29, 32, and 36, all of which have a long tail moiety that fits in this region of the enzyme. On the other hand, more compact inhibitors might be less sensitive to the Met/Val mutation site.",
                                "We conclude by focusing on 12, since this inhibitor exhibits the best hn/heNOS selectivity (877-fold). The D597N mutant decreases potency 8-fold, which further drops to 29-fold against the M336V/D597N mutant, even though this inhibitor does not appear to make contact with the Met/Val site. It is perhaps more instructive to consider the change in \u0394Gbind obtained from the Ki values, where \u0394Gbind=\u2212RT In Ki. \u0394Gbind for WT hnNOS, WT heNOS, and the hnNOS D597N mutant are \u22129.9, \u22124.5, and \u22127.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the Asp/Asn difference accounts for about half of \u0394\u0394Gbind between heNOS and hnNOS, leaving about \u22122.6 kcal/mol of binding affinity unexplained. This underscores the limitation of quantitatively explaining selectivity (against isoforms or mutants) by a few simple amino acid differences and a comparison of static X-ray structures. There are clear examples of differences in active-site dynamics and the ability of even conserved side chains to adjust to inhibitor binding that could also contribute to selectivity (anchored plasticity) in cases like this.27",
                                "Off-Target Profiling. Four structurally diverse compounds from this series (12, 29, 32, and 33) were screened by the National Institute of Mental Health's Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP, Table 4). In this assay,28 compounds were screened against a panel of 45 pharmacologically relevant CNS targets and receptors using a radioligand displacement assay. Initially, the assay used a primary high dose (10 \u03bcM) and then a secondary Ki determination was performed for compounds showing >50% binding in the primary assay. We classify off-target binding using the following rubric: concerning (Ki<100 nM, or <\u02dc2\u00d7 nNOS Ki value), moderate (100-300 nM, or \u02dc2-5\u00d7 nNOS Ki value), weak (>300 nM, or >\u02dc5\u00d7 nNOS Ki value, typically \u02dc1 \u03bcM), and insignificant (<50% at 10 \u03bcM). The off-target profiles of previous aminoquinolines 1 and 4 have been included for comparison. Although not as effective as 4, a slight decrease in the fraction of concerning or moderate hits for 32 is observed (11/45 for 32 compared to 15/45 for 1), while this fraction decreases further to 8/45 for 33. Unfortunately, most of the flagged targets for 32 and 33 are serotonin receptors, suggesting that the heteroaryl-alkyl tails may resemble a GPCR-ligand-like pharmacophore.29 Conversely, the off-target profiles for 12 and 29 reveal the cleanest CNS counter screening observed for 2-aminoquinolines to date, flagging only the H2 and H3 receptors as concerning for 12 and 29, respectively, which is unsurprising as these receptors are known to bind cationic amidine groups (e.g., ranitidine), while 29 only flagged an additional 4/45 targets for moderate binding.30 For 12, 21/45 targets were classified as weak (27/45 for 29), while 23/45 (12) and 13/45 (29) were classified as insignificant. These results indicate that reducing the tail group's size (as in 29) or eliminating it completely (as in 12) are both effective strategies to reduce off-target CNS binding, which may translate to improved safety in vivo.",
                                "Membrane Permeability and Microsome Stability. As our ultimate goal is to utilize these compounds as CNS drugs, membrane permeability for compounds 7, 12, 29, 33, and 37 was determined using the parallel artificial membrane permeability for the blood-brain barrier (PAMPA-BBB) assay. In this assay, an artificial membrane containing BBB phospholipids is used to assess permeability. A compound is predicted to have good BBB penetration and is classified as a \u201cCNS (+)\u201d molecule if its effective permeability (Pe) in this assay is larger than 4.0\u00d710\u22126 cm s\u22121.31-34 Additionally, the web tool SwissADME was used to make in silico passive-BBB penetrability predictions based on their validated BOILED-Egg (Brain Or IntestinaL EstimateD permeation) predictive model.353 Table 5 contains Pe values of three commercial drug standards and selected nNOS inhibitors 7, 12, 29, 33, and 37. All of the selected nNOS inhibitors are predicted \u201cCNS (+)\u201d with Pe values of up to 15.5\u00d710\u22126 cm s\u22121. Compounds 33 and 37 display the lowest permeability among the selected compounds (Pe=8.09\u00b10.67\u00d710\u22126 cm s\u22121 and 7.04\u00b12.43\u00d710\u22126 cm s\u22121, respectively), indicating that the presence of the heterocyclic tail portion may reduce the permeability of these compounds. However, while the Pe values for 33 and 37 were high enough to score as \u201cCNS (+)\u201d, the BOILED-Egg permeant model predicted that they would not have BBB penetration because of their higher tPSA values of 87.05 and 115.29 \u212b2, respectively, although these two compounds, along with all of the tested compounds, have predicted log D and log P values that are favorable for BBB penetration. Cyclopropyl compound 29, which lacks polar heterocycles of 33 and 37, has a lower tPSA (74.16 \u212b2), a twofold higher Pe, and is predicted to be BBB (+). Eliminating the substitution at the 4-position gave mixed results. Although not as high as 29, compound 7 maintained a high Pe value (11.3\u00b11.64\u00d710\u22126 cm s\u22121) relative to 33 and 37, although compound 12 was found to have the highest Pe out of all compounds assayed. Additional cellular pharmacokinetic assays are in progress.",

The results of this study (Table 6) show that 12 displays high stability relative to the positive control, as indicated by a half-life (t1/2) >60 min. However, 12 did show a sign of degradation in buffer control samples (FIG. 4).",

                                "In summary, we prepared a series of novel 7-phenyl-2-aminoquinolines possessing tail amines designed to target nNOS-specific aspartate residues Asp597/Asp602 (rnNOS/hnNOS) and thereby result in higher n/eNOS selectivity. Initially, screening compounds 5-13 revealed a preference for meta-substituted benzylamines, such as 12, which shows excellent potency and outstanding selectivity for nNOS over the other isozymes. A number of modifications to 12 were made, which included reducing or constraining amino group flexibility, substituting the 4-position of the phenyl ring, and using a 1,3,5-tri-substituted phenyl core. While the amine cannot be constrained effectively and 1,3,5-tri-substitutions clash deleteriously with heme propionates in the enzyme, some 4-position additions enhance potency and maintain high isoform selectivity via favorable interactions with isoform-specific residues on the far end of the substrate access channel, namely, Leu337/His342 (rnNOS/hnNOS). Crystal structures indicate that these compounds act as competitive arginine mimics, where the aminoquinoline forms hydrogen bonds with the active-site glutamate residue, but also that substitutions at the 4-position can reduce phenyl ring rotation to favor interactions with the Asp (Asp597/Asp602)/H4B/propionate A site over the propionate D site. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the influence of the Asp site on inhibitor potency, making this class of aminoquinolines the first with the ability to target this site in nNOS, although preference for this site varies from compound to compound. Finally, with these inhibitors, the hn/heNOS selectivity derives more from a weakening of affinity to heNOS rather than from an increase in affinity for hnNOS; inhibitors more complex than 12 tend to be less selective because of an increased affinity for heNOS. Apparently, more complex substituents provide additional contacts that improve binding to heNOS relative to hnNOS. On the basis of both their good potency and selectivity, clean CNS counterscreening (PDSP) profiles, and excellent permeability in our PAMPA-BBB assay, the most promising compounds, 12 and 29, are being advanced into preclinical studies.",

The cryogenic (100 K) X-ray diffraction data were collected remotely at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) or Advanced Light Source (ALS) through the data collection control software Blu-Ice58 and a crystal-mounting robot. When a CCD detector was used, 100-125\u00b0 of data were typically collected with 0.5\u00b0 per frame. If a Pilatus pixel array detector was used, 140-200\u00b0 of fine-sliced data were collected with 0.2\u00b0 per frame. More data frames were collected for heNOS which has a low symmetry (P21). Raw CCD data frames were indexed, integrated, and scaled using iMOSFLM,59 but the pixel array data were preferably processed with XDS60 and scaled with Aimless.61 The binding of inhibitors was detected by initial difference Fourier maps calculated with REFMAC.62 The inhibitor molecules were then modeled in Coot63 and refined using REFMAC or PHENIX.64 The symmetry of heNOS crystals was changed from the orthorhombic P212121 reported previously65 to monoclinic P21, with a \u03b2 angle only 0.6-0.7\u00b0 off compared to the original 90\u00b0. Therefore, a molecular replacement calculation with PHASER-MR66 was needed to solve the structure. In the P21 space group, there are two heNOS dimers in the asymmetric unit. Disordering in portions of inhibitors bound in the NOS active sites was often observed, sometimes resulting in poor density quality. However, partial structural features were usually still visible if the contour level of the sigmaA weighted 2m|Fo|\u2212D|Fc| map was dropped to 0.5 \u03c3, which afforded the building of reasonable models into the disordered regions. Water molecules were added in PHENIX and visually checked by Coot. The TLS67 protocol was implemented in the PHENIX refinements with each subunit as one TLS group. The omit Fo\u2212Fc density maps were calculated by the Polder map facility in PHENIX for the bound inhibitors.68 The refined structures were validated in Coot before deposition in the Protein Data Bank.",

                                "Molecular Docking Protocol. Molecular models of 20, 22, 23, 24 and 30 were developed using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) computational suite's Builder utility followed by minimization in the gas phase using the MMFF94X1 force field. The X-ray crystal structure of compound 12 bound to rat nNOS was then uploaded into MOE and prepared for docking using MOE's Structure Preparation utility. The hydrogen-bonding network of the docking model was further optimized at pH 7.4 by automatically sampling different tautomer/protomer states using Protonate3D, which calculates optimal protonation states, including titration, rotamer, and \u201cflips\u201d using a large-scale combinatorial search. The heme binding pocket of chain A was surveyed using MOE's Site Finder utility and populated with inactivate dummy atoms that define the docking location. Following the preparation of the rnNOS docking model and inactivation of the atoms of 12, molecular docking using the previously generated ligand conformation database was carried out at the docking site specified by the dummy atoms populating the binding pocket of chain A of the docking receptor. Ligand placement employed the Alpha Triangle method with Affinity dG scoring to generate 100 data points per unique ligand, which were further refined using the Induced Fit method with GBVI/WSA2 dG scoring to obtain the top 50 docking poses per ligand. The Amber12:EHT3 force field was used to perform these calculations. The top ligand docking pose was then imported into the docking rnNOS structure and overlaid with the original atoms of compound 12 to show a range of substituents capable of being accommodated at position 4 of the phenyl ring (data not shown).",
                                "Constrained Amine Analogues 16-18. The fact that both 5 and 10 can interfere with the aspartate site encouraged the preparation of isoindoline compound 16, which can be thought of as a conformationally constrained hybrid of both 5 and 10. However, at 254 nM, 16 is considerably less potent than either 5 or 10, which suggests that either (a) the flexibility of the aminomethyl group is explicitly needed for effective binding or (b) the extra methylene added to constrain the amine is detrimental to binding. This observation of reduced flexibility correlating with lower potency is also noted for 17 and 18. Compound 17, a constrained version of 7, was assayed against rnNOS and was found to be approximately 3-fold less potent than the parent molecule. Similarly, 18, another constrained derivative of 12, is also about 3-fold less potent.",
                                "Small 4-Alkyloxy-3-aminomethyl Analogues 25-28. Further extending the 4-position alkyloxyl substituent in 25-27 with a longer or branched alkyl chain resulted in similar potency against rnNOS compared to 12. The alkyloxyl moiety should approach the shallow hydrophobic pocket made by Met336, Leu337, and Tyr706. Also, compounds 24, 25, and 26 retain most of the isoform selectivity (24, rn/mi=418, hn/he=164; 25, rn/mi=333, hn/he=223; 26, rn/mi=360, hn/he=307), while increased binding affinities of 27 with miNOS and heNOS substantially reduces isoform selectivity (rn/mi=156, hn/he=78).",
                                "Based on our X-ray crystal structure analysis, 25 was observed to bind to rnNOS with its n-propyloxyl moiety pointing to the aforementioned hydrophobic pocket (data not shown). However, the position of the aminomethyl moiety of 25 is ambiguous with weak density. It is likely pointing toward Asn569 instead of interacting with heme propionate A as in the case for 24 (data not shown). Whereas in heNOS, 25 clearly binds with its aminomethyl moiety H-bonded to heme propionate A (data not shown). The good non-bonded contact from the n-propyloxyl tail to the bulky Phe105 stabilizes the binding. In the rnNOS-26 structure (data not shown), the central phenyl ring of 26 presses on the heme propionate D, forcing it into a downward conformation and allowing the aminomethyl group to directly H-bond with the propionate and Tyr706. The i-propyloxyl tail is not that close to the hydrophobic pocket. In the heNOS-26 structure (data not shown) the i-propyloxyl tail makes good contact with Phe105, and the aminomethyl group forms a good H-bond with the heme propionate A. Moreover, in one subunit of each dimer there is a second molecule of 26 bound in the pterin site via a stacking interaction between the aminoquinoline of 26 and the Trp447 side chain. However, the H4B in the other subunit is not displaced.",
                                "On the other hand, the hnNOS binding affinities of 25-27 show a slight decline in potency. This was thought to be the result of an increased repulsion of the 4-position alkyl group as the hydrophobic moieties approach the human nNOS-specific residue, His342.5 Unexpectedly, in each subunit there are two molecules of inhibitors bound in both the active site and the pterin site as shown in the crystal structures of 25 and 26 bound to hnNOS (data not shown). The aminomethyl moiety of 25 or 26 makes a H-bond with Asn574. The n-propyl group of 25 or i-propyl of 26 allows for interactions with hydrophobic residue Met341 but is far from His342. Both show superior binding affinity to hnNOS (25, Ki (hnNOS)=58 nM; 26, Ki (hnNOS)=66 nM). By virtue of their improved hnNOS inhibition, 25 and 26 also have improved hnNOS/heNOS selectivity (25; hn/he=333) relative to 24, while a loss in potency against human nNOS for 27 (Ki (hnNOS)=72 nM) in conjunction with improved heNOS binding (Ki (hnNOS)=5.65 uM) contributes to a substantial drop in n/e selectivity (hn/he=78).",
                                "The binding of a second inhibitor molecule in the pterin site results in some substantial and unexpected changes in structure. The quinoline ring of 25 or 26 in the pterin site is sandwiched between Trp683 and Phe696. The aminoquinoline also forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network between the backbone carbonyl of Val682 and with heme propionate A through two additional water molecules. Most notably, displacement of H4B by 25 or 26 results in the loss of the H-bond between H4B and Arg601, leading to disordering of the protein backbone containing residues 598-611 (data not shown). The original helical structure (598-605) is disrupted and replaced by a small 310 helix (600-602) followed by a P-hairpin like surface loop (603-611). Dual inhibitor binding was also observed for 26 in heNOS (data not shown), and has been observed in the past,6 where it often created an additional Zn binding site; however, there was no protein backbone distortion found in heNOS. The exact reason for this pterin site disruption-triggered protein backbone secondary structural changes in hnNOS remains to be explored.",
                                "Examination of the 1.80 \u212b resolution crystal structure of 28 bound to rnNOS (data not shown) showed that the cyclobutane ring has van der Waals interactions in the Met336-Leu337-Tyr706 pocket, allowing the aminomethyl group to form H-bonds with both Tyr706 and heme propionate D. This new position of the aminomethyl moiety of 28, along with the hydrophobic interactions with Met336, Leu337, and Tyr706, led to good potency against rnNOS (Ki (rnNOS)=49 nM). Compound 28 binds somewhat differently in hnNOS. We observed that the tail cyclobutyl ring of 28 rotates \u201cup\u201d relative to how 28 binds in rnNOS, which is because of the repulsion from the more polar residue His342 (vs. Leu337 in rnNOS) (data not shown). The aminomethyl group points toward Asn574. It seems likely that the better nonpolar contacts provided by Met336/Leu337 in rnNOS accounts for the difference in inhibitor binding and, possibly, the slightly better binding affinity to rnNOS (Table 1). In heNOS, the cyclobutane of 28 is positioned similar to rnNOS (data not shown), where it can interact with Phe105 in heNOS. However, the central phenyl ring flips 180o relative to rnNOS so that the aminomethyl group can interact with heme propionate A rather than heme propionate D as in rnNOS.",
                                "Unusual binding behavior of 31. Examination of the hnNOS-31 structure showed that 31 binds to human nNOS with high variability (data not shown), suggesting less than an optimal binding conformation. The available electron density is strongest at the aminoquinoline position but dissipates when moving toward the central and tail phenyl groups. The middle phenyl ring sits vertically between the heme propionates allowing the amine group to hydrogen bond with G1n483. The cyano group of the tail phenyl ring possibly approaches Trp311 (from the other chain). Even more puzzling is that we have failed to obtain good rnNOS X-ray data with 31 bound. On the other hand, the binding of 31 was found to be more ordered in the heNOS-31 structure (data not shown). The aminomethyl moiety points toward Glu361. The conformation of the tail phenyl is somewhat uncertain, but a piece of electron density is present next to His371, suggesting that the cyano group of the tail phenyl ring can interact with His371, which may explain the rather tight binding (8.3 \u03bcM) of 31 to heNOS.",
                                "Structural features of 36 and 37. In the rnNOS-36 structure, the aminomethyl moiety of the central phenyl ring was found to point to G1n478 (data not shown). The tail oxazole ring sits in the pocket of Met336, Leu337, and Tyr706, with its ring nitrogen pointing toward Tyr706. Binding of 36 to hnNOS is unusual (data not shown) because there are two molecules of 36 in each subunit. Instead of approaching the hydrophobic pocket made up by Met341, His342, and Tyr711, the tail oxazole ring of 36 bends over to reach the second inhibitor bound in the pterin site, stacking with the central benzene ring of that inhibitor. The disturbance of the protein backbone (residues 598-611, as discussed above) also occurs here, but it is not as severe as in the cases of hnNOS-25 or hnNOS-26. The backbone was finally modeled as a mixture of two alternate conformations.",
                                "Crystal structures of 37 bound to rat and human nNOS reveal strong densities for both the aminoquinoline and the middle phenyl rings, and weaker densities at the tail aminomethyl group and thiazole ring (data not shown). The orientation preference of the phenyl ring observed for 35 is repeated for 37 in two nNOS species, with the aminomethyl group pointing toward G1n478 in the rnNOS structure and toward Asn574 in the hnNOS structure. Although the orientation of the thiazole ring is almost identical in the two structures, the bulkier His342 of human nNOS slightly pushes the tail thiazole ring of 37 away relative to the position seen in the rat enzyme.
