However, the error rate associated with this technology in current sequencing platforms prevents it from confident identification of rare mutations.

However, a random sequence barcode can be frequently misidentified due to sequencing errors in the barcode region, and the cost for generating large varieties of sequence predefined barcodes is very high."
