    "abstract": "The present disclosure is directed to rheometric fixtures for making rheological measurements of yield stress fluids. In some embodiments, the fixture can be an improvement of a typical vane by having the ability to create a more homogeneous shear profile in a test material, e.g., a yield stress fluid. These vane fixtures having fractal-like cross-sectional structures enable robust rheological measurements of the properties of yield stress fluids due to several outer contact edges that lead to increased kinematic homogeneity at the point of yielding and beyond. The branching structure of the fractal-like fixtures can alter the shape of a wetted perimeter of the fixture while minimizing an area thereof to allow the fixture to be inserted into fluids with less disturbance. In some embodiments, a cup with a ribbed inner surface can be used to hold the sample fluid and disassembles for ease of cleaning following completion of the measurement.",

                        "The rheology of a material describes its viscosity as a function of shear rate, temperature, concentration, and other factors. This measurement allows for quantitatively predicting material behavior in a wide variety of processes, including mixing, pumping, squirting, and scooping, and is also useful for quality control. Materials such as yield stress fluids are those that have a critical stress above which it flows like a viscoplastic liquid, and below which it deforms as a viscoelastic solid. Common yield stress fluids include emulsions, foams, particulate suspensions, and granular materials, in which particles, bubbles, emulsions, or other microparticle constituents interact via weak physico-chemical forces and geometric packing/jamming constraints. Some examples of industrial yield stress fluids include shampoo, conditioner, hair gel, lotions, toothpaste, condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise, structural materials like concrete and grout, and more. As the imposed stress acting on these soft solids increases, complex time-dependent rheological signatures arise from underlying microstructural processes such as shear-induced break-down and restructuring. Additionally, other effects can wise such as time-dependent aging and onset of non-homogeneous flow, resulting in common rheological signatures, including a strong influence of the history of deformation, hysteresis, thixotropy, shear-banding, and of slip of the material on the surface of the tool used for rheological measurements. As a result, sensitivity to loading conditions, ensuring kinematic homogeneity, and unambiguous control of history of deformation each pose challenges for rheological measurements of yield stress fluids.",
                        "Further, as a result of the complexities encountered in measuring the rheology of thixo-elasto-visco-plastic (TEVP) yield stress fluids, a vane has become the rheometric tool geometry of choice, as it prevents the slip of material and minimizes sample damage/alteration during the sample loading process. The vane geometry for rheometry initially was developed in the 1980s by civil engineers as a tool to quantify the yield stress of soils and thick clays. Work by Nguyen and Boger adapted the vane for muds and slurries and derived a simple quantitative relationship between the torque imposed on the rotating vane and the resulting shear stress acting on the sample. The vane subsequently has become a standard tool for measuring the yield stress of delicate materials and structured fluids.",
                        "The vane geometry most typically consists of four to six straight blades of equal length fanning out from a center point in a cruciform or hexagonal arrangement, and \u201cvane\u201d can refer to either the bladed portion of the tool contacting the material being tested or to the entire tool, with the vane most commonly being a fluid-contacting end and a rotor being the entire tool. The vane is submerged inside a cup of the sample material and then rotated about its central axis; the rheometer records the torque and rotation angle. This rotation deforms an approximately cylindrical plug of material, generating an ideally axisymmetric stress field, while also restricting sample slip, which is an issue for cylindrical Couette rotors. The vane, despite its more complex geometry, has been used to impose a range of standard rheometric test protocols, including measurement of steady state flow curves, start-up of steady shear, creep/recoil, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). Systematic comparisons of rheological measurements made using vanes to those using other standard rheometric tools can sometimes have some numerical agreement between values measured with vanes and with other geometries, as long as the fluids being measured have significant yield stress, a shear thinning index above 0.5, and no significant thixotropy or history-dependent viscosity. However, many fluids do not conform to those requirements, but still require slip-free measurements enabled by vane-like tools.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need to create improved systems, devices, and methods for reducing recirculation of yield stress fluids between the vane arms and increase the shear stress homogeneity in the fluid close to the vanes without substantially increasing the occluded area fraction of the vane."

The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure.",
                        "To the extent a term like \u201cfractal\u201d or \u201cfractal-like\u201d is used herein, a person skilled in the art, in view of the present disclosure, will understand that it includes a design that branches for two or more generations in a fractal-type or -like pattern, understanding that fractals can go on infinitely but the instantly disclosed designs can continue in fractal-like patterns for several generations. Additionally, a person skilled in the art will recognize that the term \u201cfractal structure\u201d refers to a construction having one or more core branches extending axially that break into multiple arms, as described and illustrated in greater detail below.",
                        "Further, to the extent the term \u201ccruciform\u201d is described in the present disclosure, a person skilled in the art will recognize that it refers to a shape that resembles a wind turbine or a cross, among other shapes recognizable by those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure. Typical examples of the cruciform shape can have three arms disposed in a triangular arrangement, four arms disposed in a cross arrangement, or six arms that are disposed in a hexagonal arrangement. The arms of the cruciform shape can typically be straight, though, in some embodiments, one of the arms of the cruciform shape can be curved.",

Still further, in the present disclosure, like-numbered components of various embodiments generally have similar features when those components are of a similar nature and/or serve a similar purpose. Lastly, the present disclosure includes some illustrations and descriptions that include prototypes or bench models. A person skilled in the art will recognize how to rely upon the present disclosure to integrate the techniques, systems, devices, and methods provided for into a product in view of the present disclosures.",
                        "The present disclosure generally relates to systems, devices, and methods for design, fabrication, and use of a fixture for making rheological measurements, i.e., measurements (e.g., yield stress) pertaining to the deformation and flow of a material. The fixture can be in the shape of a vane having a fractal-like structure, including a central spindle with core branches extending axially from the spindle, one or more of the core branches breaking into multiple arms. The spindle can be circularly symmetric.",
                        "A person skilled in the art will recognize that the vanes disclosed in the present disclosure are structurally different from conventional vanes provided for in the prior art. For example, unlike existing embodiments of vanes having one or more arms that emanate from a single central location in a cruciform shape, the vanes of the present embodiments have a fractal-like structure that includes one or more arms that originate at one or more of the existing arms. This configuration provided herein provides a larger number of contact points at the edge of the vane while minimizing the occluded area of the fixture. The branching, tree-like fractal structure can be optimized to give a large surface area and large number of perimeter contact points with material to be tested, e.g., a test fluid, while the internal structure remains sparse in terms of displaced volume relative to a bob to limit pre-shearing of a structurally-sensitive material during sample loading. In particular, the series of fractal-like branched structures, which in some instances may be referred to as vane structures, are designed to minimize material displacement when loading the tool into the sample material, making this structure uniquely better in some situations than current tools. Some non-limiting examples of terms that can be used to describe the structures of the present embodiments in lieu of and/or in addition to the term \u201cvane,\u201d and are described as being \u201cvanes\u201d for purposes of brevity throughout the instant application, can include a snare, e.g., fractal snare, snare cup, a thixometer, e.g., fractal thixometer, cup thixometer, props, e.g., propellers such as thixometer prop, biprop, octo-prop, icosatetra-prop (24), a rotor or lace rotor, a venous rotor, miter, grapnel, mesh anchor, fractal (fractal-rotor), fractal anchor, dumbbell anchor, firefly, tractor (traction rotor), dendril (tendril), trap, slip-trap rotor, grip-n-grab rotor, antler rotor, Vaneomous Tentacula, Velcro vane, Gecko foot, fluid snare, soft matter snare, dreamcatcher, streamcatcher, creamcatcher, branching capillaries, arterial occlusion, octopus, Electron tree, Lichtenberg fractal, Burr rotor, Articule (from articum), stirrolator, swimmer spinner, e.g., the slimmer swimmer spinner, and/or a STAR rotor (Slip-free testing advantage rotor rotor), among others. Therefore, even though the term \u201cvane\u201d is used to describe the fixtures of the present embodiments, the instantly disclosed structures are different from those previously known to a person skilled in the art, although a term different than \u201cvane\u201d may or may not be used herein and the differences between prior art vanes and what is provided for herein will still be understood by a person skilled in the art. The instantly disclosed embodiments can create a more homogeneous stress field, reducing the level of error in measurements, and improving quantitative accuracy in measuring yield stress. The partially enclosed cavities formed within the fractal-like structures additionally limit recirculation of enclosed fluids during measurements, and the disclosed embodiments can create more precise measurements of the viscosity of less viscous fluids.",
                        "In some embodiments, the instantly disclosed embodiments can be three-dimensionally (3D) printed rather than machined out of metal, which allows for production at a much lower cost and at a more rapid rate. In some embodiments, the vane can be used with a cup to improve convenience and versatility of the entire testing procedure. For example, the cup can hold the sample material being tested, and can include a textured inner surface for gripping material. The cup can be detachable from a rigid base, as a cylinder without a bottom, making it easy to load and clean thicker or gelling samples. The base can be designed to facilitate attachment of different cups thereto. In other embodiments, the vane can be used directly in a large vat of fluid or in a cup of various shapes.",
                        "Rheology of Yield Stress Fluids and Prior Art",
                        "The generic term \u201cyield stress fluid\u201d typically applies to a fluid that exhibits a characteristic stress below which it may deform viscoelastically (i.e., as it creeps) but does not flow, and above which it flows steadily like a (typically shear-thinning) liquid. In addition to the role of a critical material stress, time-dependent degradation and rebuilding of the underlying material structure may occur, leading to complex rheological responses that depend both on time and on sample history.",
                        "The simplest constitutive model appropriate for describing the steady flow curve of yield stress fluids is the Hershel-Bulkley model,",
                        "\u03c3({dot over (\u03b3)})=\u03c3y+k{dot over (\u03b3)}n \u03c3\u2265\u03c3y",
                        "{dot over (\u03b3)}=0 \u03c3<\u03c3y \u2003\u2003(1)",
                        "where \u03c3 is the shear stress, \u03c3y is the yield stress in shear, k is the consistency index, {dot over (\u03b3)} is the shear rate, and n is the power law index. When n=1, this corresponds to a Bingham fluid, with k\u2192\u03bc being the plastic viscosity. While many more complex models exist that can account for viscoelastic responses below yield as well as time and rate-dependent thixotropic responses (e.g., the soft glassy rheology model, the isotropic kinematic hardening model, and models by Saramito and Coussot), the simple Herschel-Bulkley viscoplastic model is sufficient for comparison with the results of steady state measurements presented herein.",
                        "FIGS. 1A-1C illustrate an exemplary prior art vane 10. As shown, and as discussed above, the vane 10 has arms 12, as shown four, of equal length fanning out from a center point 14 in a cruciform arrangement. In use, the vane 10 can be inserted into a cup 20 having a yield stress material 30 therein. Following insertion, the vane 10 can be rotated, which causes the shearing of the material 30 to exert a torque on the vane 10. This rotation deforms an approximately cylindrical plug of material, generating an ideally axisymmetric stress field, while also restricting sample slip, which is a key issue for cylindrical Couette rotors. The vane 10 has been used to impose a range of standard rheometric test protocols, including measurement of steady state flow curves, start-up of steady shear, creep/recoil, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS). Systematic comparisons of rheological measurements made using vanes to those using other standard rheometric tools generally have found good numerical agreement between values measured with vanes and with other geometries. Meanwhile, any differences in measured values typically occur due to wall slip and differing sample history, affecting primarily large strain measurements and general level of repeatability in data measured with vanes compared to other non-cruciform shapes. In particular, for bentonite, direct comparisons have revealed that cone-and-plate tests systematically underestimate yield stress as compared with vanes, due, at least in part, to thixotropy associated with sample loading; for foams, SAOS measurements with vanes agree well with measurements made with parallel plate fixtures, while vanes induce less bubble coalescence; for soft cheeses, SAOS measurements with a parallel plate geometry agree well with vanes, though only vanes were capable of imposing reproducible larger-amplitude strain deformations due to sample slip occurring against the parallel plates. In direct comparisons of inter- and intra-laboratory tests, yield stress measurements made with vanes in start-up of steady shear tests have been found to be more reproducible than measurements made by other tools including slump tests on inclined planes, or creep experiments or stress ramp tests with cones and textured concentric cylinders.",
                        "The torque can then be measured as a function of rotation angle and rate by a rheometer 40 to which the vane 10 is coupled. Due to the presence of a yield stress in the material being measured, the sample in the cup deforms as a sheared cylinder guided by the vanes, preventing slip and generating kinematics that closely approximate those of a concentric cylinder system.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 1B, the local stress decays radially from the cylinder of material 30 cut by the vane, out to a radius Rv where \u03c3(r)=\u03c3y. Inside the vane boundary r<Rv, material ideally moves as a solid plug guided by the vane arms, and the radial velocity v(r) decays from v=\u03a9Rv at the edge of the vane to v=0 at r=Ry, although the velocity profile is expected to deviate from an axisymmetric path, especially if the vane has few arms. While the vane geometry is well suited for measuring the instantaneous torque My (and the corresponding yield stress \u03c3y at the instant of yielding), the streamlines become noncircular when measuring strongly shear-thinning materials at higher shear rates, or for measuring viscous Newtonian fluids, due to secondary flows (i.e., slow recirculation of fluid eddies) between the vane arms. That is, the fluid-filled space between each pair of vane arms functions as a lid-driven cavity with a slow steady recirculating flow that contributes additional dissipation to the total measured torque.",
                        "Further, the stress field in the sheared sample is non-uniform and localized around the perimeter at the edges of each arm of the vane 10. In fact, analysis for the stress field (in a Newtonian fluid or a linear elastic solid) near a knife-edge singularity in torsional deformation shows that at each arm tip there is a stress singularity that scales inversely proportionally to the number of vane arms. By increasing the number of tips in contact with outer fluid, the stress field becomes progressively more homogeneous along circles of constant radius from the vane center.",
                        "The shearing profile around the vane is axisymmetric only for certain materials and under specific flow conditions. Secondary flows arise when the viscosity is too low, resulting in recirculation between neighboring pairs of arms; these are exacerbated when the power-law index of a shear thinning fluid is >0.5 (more Newtonian); and when the vane has too few arms to hold a given material securely (typically needing greater than three arms) and flow kinematics are measurably influenced even with six arms. For viscoelastic materials, this recirculation has been shown to cause a significant artificial increase in the apparent viscosity reported by the instrument at high Reynolds numbers. Detailed theoretical and computational analysis of the region near a single knife-edge of a vane reveals that the stress field is singular at the tip, and consequently the stress field around a multi-arm vane tool shows spatially periodic variations for any material with Newtonian, yield stress, or linear elastic behavior. Consequently, even when the streamlines in a sheared fluid sample are circular, instantaneous structural parameters characterizing the local properties of thixotropic fluids can be strongly influenced by the location of the blades, becoming non-axisymmetric with the vane rotation.",
                        "Vanes with a larger number of arms that extend from a central location can lead to errors in measurement. For example, adding more arms to the vane 10 displaces and disturbs more material when the vane 10 is inserted into a sample, which has been shown to lead to underestimations of the yield stress, and may make measurements on thixotropic fluids that exhibit a strong memory of their initial deformation history during loading less repeatable. To quantify this effect and explore it systematically, we define the occluded area fraction (OAF) as the cross-sectional area of fluid displaced by an N-arm vane normalized by the area of a circle with the same outer radius:",

                        "As shown in FIG. 1C, the OAF for a three-arm vane can be 0.12 while that of a cylinder is 1.00, as the cylinder displaces an amount of fluid proportional to the full cross-sectional area of the cylinder. A person skilled in the art will recognize that computing numerical values of this expression obviously depends on N as well as the thickness t of each vane. For example, a 4-arm vane with a thickness of 0.13Rv (typical of commercial vanes) has an OAF of 4\u00d70.13/\u03c0=0.16=16%. In addition to displaced area, more complex material systems (e.g., thixotropic fluids or multiphase systems with large particulate inclusions) may also be influenced by the overall branched structure and by loading procedures such as speed of insertion of the tool. Cross-sectional profiles of conventional vane designs are shown in FIG. 1C, along with numerical values of OAF for each design, and corresponding values for vanes with N straight radial arms (denoted OAFN for clarity). Despite the above-mentioned difficulties and/or errors, vanes are particularly useful for ensuring repeatability of measurements and for characterizing structurally-sensitive materials. This is at least because vanes displace far less material and impose a much weaker deformation history during initial sample loading, which is particularly important for thixotropic samples. With a cone-and-plate, parallel-plate, or concentric-cylinder tool configurations, the sample must be compressed and sheared to fill the thin gap between the two fixture surfaces. Compared to a bob, a vane can more easily be inserted into a cup that has been previously filled with a structured material, and the vane typically displaces less than 20% of the sample volume compared to a bob of equivalent radius. A person skilled in the art will recognize that a bob is a solid cylinder that is configured to be used inside a cylindrical sample cup. The fluid is tested in the annulus between these two concentric cylinders with a rheometer motor and torque sensor connected to one or both objects. The resulting torque on the rheometer is measured, allowing shear force at the bob surface to be calculated. This results in more repeatable measurements and control of the initial shear history for the material. Furthermore, use of vanes allows samples to be prepared and aged in containers for long waiting times before testing on the rheometer.",
                        "Alternatives to the vane geometry that have been proposed for yield stress fluids include paired helical blades for preventing sedimentation while measuring dense samples such as concrete with large aggregates, torsional mixers, and planetary rotating systems, along with other styles of test including penetration and slump tests.

The introduction of a new fractal-based vane geometry utilizes a manufacturing method that can achieve complex features without excessive cost, and that is capable of creating thin and closely-spaced features such as the profiles shown in FIG. 2, which are discussed in greater detail below. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is exceptionally well suited for this task, as its layer-by-layer nature allows complex geometries to be created in three dimensions with, ideally, minimal post-processing or shaping. In particular, designs such as these extruded vanes that are geometrically complex with fractal-like patterns along a single axis and without overhanging features can be printed with high quality using stereolithography. Manufacturing thin, high-aspect ratio cavities by other methods such as machining, injection molding, or casting would be more challenging.",

The arms 112 can be considered to be extending linearly or directly from the root location 114. A person skilled in the art will recognize that while the root location 114 is central within the fixture 110 in the illustrated views, it may not be centrally disposed relative to a height of the fixture. Moreover, in some embodiments, the root location 114 can be offset from the central location.

The fixtures 110 of the present embodiments, unlike the vanes of the prior art, are not in a cruciform arrangement. Rather, the presently disclosed fixtures 110 include a fractal or fractal-like internal structure. As shown, the fractal internal structure can include one or more additional branches of arms 112\u2032 that originate from the arms that extend from the central location of the fixture. These additional branches of arms 112\u2032 can create a second generation of arms that extend the surface area of the fixture 110 while maintaining a larger surface area-to-volume ratio to the tool, leading to improved axisymmetry of the yield surfaces at the point of yielding and a more accurate determination of the yield stress.",
                        "Fractal internal structures are also advantageous for fitting into small spaces due to a small cross-sectional area as compared to number of contact points. The contact points as applied to the instantly disclosed embodiments include the solid portions of the vane at r=R_v, and can be surfaces and/or edges thereof, and are quantified by the number of arms N. For example, the number of contact points of the present embodiments can be approximately in the range of about six to about forty-eight, or in the range of about eight to about twenty-four outer contact points. The branching, tree-like fractal structure was designed to give a large wetted perimeter, e.g., surface area divided by the radius, relative to the occluded area fraction, and large number of contact points with the test fluid, while the internal structure remains sparse in terms of displaced volume relative to a bob, to limit pre-shearing of a structurally-sensitive material during sample loading. The gaps or spaces between each central arm and each additional generation of arms can be substantially occlusion-free such that test fluid can fill these spaces during testing of the material and less fluid is displaced. A person skilled in the art will recognize that substantially occlusion-free suggests that there is no material of the fixture in these spaces such that fluid and other test material can flow freely therebetween. For example, the branches between the root location 114, or primordial spoke, and an outer surface encloses concave regions or cavities that contain the test material during tests. For example, a ratio of the wetted perimeter to an occluded area fraction of the fixture can be approximately in the range of about 30 to about 100, though in some embodiments the ratio can be approximately in the range of about 40 to about 80, or approximately in the range of about 40 to about 70. Moreover, a ratio of the occluded area fraction to the number of outer contact edges of the fixture can be approximately in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.05. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that other values for these parameters are possible.",

These voids are typically fluid-filled when using the vane to measure the fluid properties, and result in less deformation of this enclosed fluid, reducing errors in measurement.",

For example, in some embodiments, the vane 510 can couple to the rheometer 500 using a coupling component (not shown) that is machined or otherwise manufactured, e.g., 3D printed, to interface between the vane 510 and the rheometer 500 to facilitate coupling. Coupling can occur via insertion of the coupling component into one or more of the vane and/or the rheometer or otherwise attaching to either of the vane or the rheometer to hold the vane in place.",
                        "In some embodiments, the overall dimensions and rheometer coupling of fractal vanes can be based on the commercial vane (N=4) available for the TA Instruments DHR series of rheometers with a diameter of 2Rv=15 mm and a length of L=30 mm, though this coupling can be varied. The vane body was printed via stereolithography on a Form2 printer (Formlabs, Inc.) using Clear resin (Formlabs, Inc.), a methacrylate-based translucent photopolymer with Young's Modulus E=1.6 GPa, and ultimate tensile strength UTS=38 MPa (pre-curing). To facilitate attachment of the vane 510 directly to the draw rod of the rheometer, a threaded coupling can be included. A person skilled in the art will appreciate many of coupling techniques that can be used without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure. A slope on the mating joint between a spindle holding the vane and the coupling to the rheometer can allow the vane to be printed entirely without a supporting structure, increasing printing speed and quality, as well as obviating the need for support removal. To enable this, the vanes can be printed vertically, vane-end first. This orientation can ensure a good concentricity of the vane geometry with the printed rheometer coupling and a good surface texture as it avoids consecutive layers giving a \u201cstair stepping\u201d texture on the surface and negating any imprecision in the x-y and z-stage calibrations. The feature resolution is found to be approximately 200 \u03bcm over several cm, and vanes can be printed with the coarsest 100 \u03bcm layer height setting of the Form2 printer. Printing can take approximately three to about three-and-a-half hours per single build platform. The print time can scale sublinearly with the number of vanes printed in each tray due to the high speed of lateral in-plane motion that can be achieved in stereolithography, compared to the time used to recoat resin and incrementally move the build platform after each layer. For example, while one vane can be printed in about three hours, scalability can allow a dozen vanes to be printed in about seven hours.",
                        "In some embodiments, to robustly attach to a commercial rheometer, the printed vane geometry can be designed to accommodate a threaded insert (not shown) rather than by including printed threads integral to the vane. The coupling can be designed to be 3D-printed, fitted with an M4 threaded insert, and attached directly to a DHR3 or AR-G2 rheometer spindle (Discovery Hybrid Rheometer 3 or Advanced Rheometer-Generation 2; TA instruments, New Castle, Del.). The DHR and AR-G2 family of controlled stress rheometers can have a loose threaded \u201cdraw rod\u201d extending through the drag cup motor housing and sensing head, with a spindle that aligns the geometry to the axis of rotation of the rheometer. The 3D-printed part, which can have a loose interference fit (approximately 50 \u03bcm overlap) on the spindle for radial positioning, can lock in place axially using the spindle M4 screw with a threaded nut insert. These two generations of controlled-stress rheometers can also have a drag cup motor, radial air bearings, magnetic thrust bearings, and an optical encoder in the head of the rheometer. The stationary base can have a temperature sensor and Peltier plate assembly. A standard geometry can slide up onto the spindle and can be held axially in place by a long-threaded rod. In general, the presently disclosed embodiments contemplate modifications to the 3D printed or otherwise fabricated vane geometry to enable mounting to a rheometer, and/or improvement of its performance as governed by surface finish, runout of rotation, or other attributes. Such modifications may comprise polishing, machining, or other material removal processes, or assembly with other components to create an assembly comprising a vane tool.",
                        "FIGS. 7A-7C provide an alternate embodiment of a vane 610 that includes a central lumen 611 extending therethrough. The central lumen 611 can be configured to receive a central shaft 602 therethrough that can rotate the vane 610. As shown in FIGS. 7B-7C, the central shaft 602 can be configured to correspond to a shape of the vane 610 such that the vane 610 is received in corresponding grooves 604 of the central shaft 602, and vice versa, to couple the shaft 602 to the vane 610. A person skilled in the art will recognize that the shape of one or more of the vane 610 and/or the central shaft 602 can change based on a number of factors, including but not limited to a number of arms 612 in the vane to allow for the coupling to occur.",
                        "The vanes of the presently disclosed embodiments can be used in conjunction with a cup 520, which can contain a yield stress material to be measured. The cup 520 can be provided to improve convenience and versatility of the entire testing procedure. As shown in FIG. 8A, the cup 520 can complement the 3D printed vane 510 and serve as the sample holder. An inner surface 522 of the cup 520 can be textured with ribs 524 or similar features known to those skilled in the art to help prevent slip of the sheared sample at the outer wall, with, in some embodiments, square steps of approximately 1 mm width by approximately 1 mm depth, spaced apart by approximately 2 mm. These dimensions were chosen to give similar spacing as the arms of the 24-armed fractal vanes and to promote infill of the material into the gaps between the ribs 524 of the cup as shown in FIGS. 8A-8B. The inset shows that the crenelated ribs 524 around the outer surface can have approximately 1 mm width and side length, and approximately 2 mm spacing, though a person skilled in the art will recognize that these dimensions can vary.",
                        "In some embodiments, the cup 520 can be textured and 3D printed, and further, can be configured to attach to a standard rheometer base 528. For example, the cup 520 can include a base 526 that can be threaded, glued, or otherwise associated in a variety of ways with the cup 520 that will be recognized by a person having ordinary skill in the art. By way of non-limiting example, the base 526 can fasten onto the Peltier plate 528 that is a standard lower fixture on the DHR or AR-G2. The Peltier plate 528 can hold it, for instance, by an interference fit of six protruding arms or by using the arms as guides and using double-sided tape under the base for a more adjustable hold, among other techniques. A well-calibrated Peltier plate is generally orthogonal to the axis of the rotating spindle but is not necessarily concentric with it. The yielded area can be set entirely by the location of the vane perimeter and can extend radially outwards. Provided the yielded area does not reach the outer wall (i.e., provided the imposed wall shear stress is \u03c3w/\u03c3y<(Rc/Rv)2, the cup shape and position only influences the spatial homogeneity of the linear viscoelastic deformation that occurs pre-yielding, with an effect proportional to the offset of the rotation axis. For measurements of yield stress fluids with a wide-gap geometry, precise concentricity of the cup may not be critical.",
                        "The cup 520 can be designed for facile use with yield-stress fluids. It is often challenging to fill a sample into the cup without bubbles and to clean out after use, especially given the crenelated walls. Viscous Newtonian fluids, which flow at every point inside the cup, are more sensitive to the internal structural details of the vane, which can enhance or inhibit local recirculations. A person skilled in the art will recognize that while the instant disclosure discusses use of yield stress fluids such as shampoo, conditioner, hair gel, lotions, toothpaste, condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise, and/or concrete, the presently disclosed cup 520 can hold a variety of solids or liquids therein. By contrast, the deformation in yield stress fluids is more sensitive to the number of outer contact edges, N, while the limited radial extent of the yield surface cloaks the geometric details of the inner structure of the vane from the flow field. As a result, the cup 520 can unscrew from the base 526, making it straightforward to access material in the cup for filling and cleaning, as shown in FIGS. 8C-8D. In such embodiments, the cup can be detachable as a cylinder without a bottom, making it easy to load and clean thicker or gelling samples. As an added benefit, this means that a single base can be used interchangeably with several 3D printed cups that differ in height and diameter, or that are pre-filled with different fluid samples, as long as they use the same (custom) 3D-printed mating thread. This enables multiple samples to be pre-filled and conditioned with a controlled waiting time and thermal history, if desired, then mounted directly onto the rheometer just prior to testing. Moreover, vanes and textured cups made by desktop stereolithography can be used to obtain rheological measurements that are consistent with \u201creference\u201d measurements made by machined cone-and-plate geometries with carefully roughened surfaces to eliminate slip. A person skilled in the art would recognize that such a cup can include additional features, such as an embedded mirror or window to enable viewing of the inside of the cup during experiments. In some embodiments, the cup can include holes through which to exchange fluid or air to and/or from the cup rather than using the single top opening that is typically accessed during experiments."

                        "i. Carbopol",
                        "Carbopol was loaded into the textured cup and a constant rotation rate was imposed, approximately in the range of about 1.8\u00d710\u22124 to about 6\u00d710\u22121 rad/s, corresponding to shear rates approximately in the range of about 4\u00d710\u22123 to about 8 s\u22121. The rotation rate was imposed for a set time that varied inversely with the rotation rate and increased sequentially in steps, with a 10 second waiting time between steps. In response to a single rotation rate, the stress initially grows linearly in time elastically followed by a plastic flow regime. When this transient stress response is plotted as a function of apparent strain, \u03b8=\u03a9t, the curves superpose for all shear rates. The initial deformation is nearly linear in applied strain, allowing a shear modulus of G=810 Pa to be calculated from the average slope of the elastic response, \u0394\u03c3/\u0394\u03b8, for all curves. At a critical apparent strain, \u03b8y\u22480.2, the material yields and undergoes plastic deformation, reaching a terminal stress that is nearly independent of shear rate over three decades of deformation rate. This is because the very low shear rates applied correspond to the stress plateau region shown in FIG. 7b so \u03c3w\u2248\u03c3y=110 Pa at long times for all these deformation rates. In response to increasing the imposed rotation rate \u03a9, the terminal stress increases slowly and monotonically with rotation rate, but all curves reach the plastic flow regime with a terminal stress approximately within the range about 122e\u2264\u03c3+(t\u2192\u221e)\u2264182 Pa.",
                        "ii. Mayonnaise",
                        "Mayonnaise (Hellmann's Squirtable) is a vinegar-and-egg-based emulsion of oil in water. Over time, the fat globules coalesce and particle flocs aggregate, yet imposed stress breaks up structures and/or induces particle migration and mild phase separation, thus resulting in a thixotropic yield stress response. This makes rheometry of such structured materials very difficult as they show sensitivity to their entire history, including the loading step required to place a sample into the rheometer. For this reason, the mayonnaise samples were held in the original off-the-shelf container for experiments. To investigate the thixotropy of the mayonnaise, a conditioning step was performed to reset the material history after the vane was inserted using a pre-shear rate {dot over (\u03b3)}=0.1 s\u22121 for about 10 seconds, followed by a waiting time, tw, varying from about 3 seconds to about 10,000 seconds. Lastly, a constant rotation rate of approximately 1.6\u00d710\u22124 rad/s for times t>tw was imposed. For all waiting times, the initial viscoelastic response is a power law with slope less than unity, indicating strain-dependent plastic losses. Subsequently, the material yields, showing a stress overshoot that depends strongly on the waiting time, tw, before approaching a steady state terminal shear stress. This thixotropic overshoot is indicative of progressive structural buildup following the cessation of preshearing.",
                        "The initial power law characteristics of the transient stress growth are common in many microstructured food gels. One way of compactly modeling this response is by using a Scott Blair fractional element to quantify the rate-dependent material properties. This model has two parameters: a viscoelastic quasi-modulus G, and a fractional exponent \u03b1 characterizing the order of the fractional derivative. For instance, \u03b1=0 indicates a purely elastic response, and \u03b1=1 indicates a purely viscous response. The stress-strain relationship for a Scott Blair element is defined as",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{\\sigma_{y\ue89ex} = {\ue506\ue89e\\frac{d^{\\alpha}\ue89e\\gamma}{{dt}^{\\alpha}}}} & (9)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "with the fractional derivative dependent on the exponent \u03b1. For start-up of steady shear after a waiting time tw, where the apparent strain \u03b3\u03b8=\u03a9(t\u2212tw), results in",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{\\sigma_{y\ue89ex} = {\\frac{\ue506}{\\Gamma \ue8a0\\left( {1 - \\alpha} \\right)}\ue89e\\left( {t - t_{w}} \\right)^{1 - \\alpha}\ue89e\\left( {{{{for}\ue89e\\mspace{14mu} \ue89e\\alpha} \\neq 0},1} \\right)}} & (10)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "where \u0393(\u00b7) is the gamma function. This time-dependent relationship was fitted to transient stress growth curves for times tw\u2264t\u2264tlin where tlin is the point at which the stress first reaches a value equal to its terminal stress. The value of the quasi-property, or scale factor  in equations (9)-(10) increases from  600 Pa\u00b7s\u03b1 at tw=3 s to =1080 Pa\u00b7s\u03b1, beyond which it plateaus for tw\u2265100 s. The fractional exponent similarly decreases from 0.46 to 0.14, beyond which it plateaus after 100 seconds, consistent with the increasingly solid-like nature of the material that occurs during restructuration. Similarly, the yield strain (at which \u03c3=\u03c3peak) increases slightly for all measurements with increasing waiting time, from \u03b8y=0.05 rad to about \u03b8y=0.09 rad. After the initial viscoelastic buildup of stress, the mayonnaise exhibits a second thixotropic behavior with a stress overshoot, in which the stress increases to a maximum value \u03c3peak before decreasing to a terminal asymptotic flow stress that is independent of sample age. The terminal stress was approximately in the range of about 65 Pa to about 70 Pa for all waiting times. The peak stress \u03c3peak was constant at about 67 Pa for waiting time twait<100 s and increased afterwards up to about 90 Pa. Based on analysis of the data, there can be distinct timescales for restructuring of the linear viscoelastic solid response and for the rise in the nonlinear overshoot stress in this material, which may both be called \u201cthixotropic\u201d timescales.",
                        "iii. Aqueous Battery Slurry",
                        "The yielding characteristics of an aqueous battery slurry comprised of Carbopol (Lubrizol, USA; 1 wt %), carbon black (acetylene black, Chevron, USA; 6 wt %), and 7 molar KOH (30 wt %) were measured; this mixture results in a paste with pH=12. The strong alkalinity increases electronic conductivity, improving performance as a battery material. It also causes this slurry material to corrode many metals, including commercial steel rheometer vanes. While the dispersed carbon black discolored our 3D printed resin, the vane did not show evidence of physical degradation even after 20 hours of experiments.",
                        "As with the other materials, a steady rotation rate was imposed (approximately 10\u22124 rad/s), without modification between trials. There was no conditioning pre-shear, because no combination of speeds and equilibration times were found to \u201creset\u201d the material to give a repeatable initial stress response (i.e., the material ages irreversibly). The waiting time was therefore held to a constant value of twait=1000 seconds between each test. The initial stress growth can be weakly sublinear in strain but remains almost constant with the number of times the sample is sheared. Fitting the data gives =430 Pa\u00b7s\u03b1 and \u03b1=0.17. The yield strain, taken at the strain at which stress is a maximum, is \u03b8y\u22480.1 rad for the first step, and nearly constant thereafter at \u03b8y\u22480.06 rad.",
                        "This battery slurry also shows mildly thixotropic behavior with a weak stress overshoot. The stress overshoot remained constant at about 20 Pa, while the terminal yield stress decreased with each successive trial from about 40 Pa down to about 30 Pa, indicating irreversible material aging with repeated shearing. This effect may be due to shear-induced gravitational settling and flocculation, or shear-induced particle migration. Therefore, this slurry recipe would not be stable during use as an electrolyte in a flow battery. Yet, the ability to rapidly and reliably make such measurements using a fractal vane with absence of slip or sample loading artifacts makes the fractal vane useful for assessing development of a functional battery slurry recipe.",
