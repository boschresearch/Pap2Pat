# I. INTRODUCTION

A yield stress fluid is a material that has a critical stress above which it flows like a viscoplastic liquid, and below which it deforms as a viscoelastic solid. Common yield stress fluids include emulsions, foams, particulate suspensions, and granular materials, in which particles, bubbles, emulsions, or other microparticle constituents interact via weak physico-chemical forces and geometric packing/jamming constraints [1][2][3][4]. As the imposed stress acting on these soft solids increases, complex time-dependent rheological signatures arise from underlying microstructural processes such as shear-induced break-down and restructuring [3,5]. In addition, other effects can arise such as time-dependent aging and onset of non-homogeneous flow, resulting in common rheological signatures, including a strong influence of the history of deformation, hysteresis, thixotropy, shear-banding, and of slip of the material on the surface of the tool used for rheological measurements [6,7]. As a result, sensitivity to loading conditions, ensuring kinematic homogeneity, and unambiguous control of history of deformation each pose particular challenges for rheological measurements of yield stress fluids [5,8].

Despite this complexity, yield stress materials find enormous application in a wide variety of commercial products, consumer goods, and construction materials due to the desirable mechanical properties imbued by the presence of a critical yield stress. Yield stresses in industrial processes influence the strength of concrete, the most utilized artificial material in the world [9], and the processing, quality, and final texture of a vast range of foodstuffs, skincare and haircare products [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Further, thixotropic materials with high values of the yield stress are particularly suited to high-resolution direct-write printing. Examples include printing of structures using foams, elastomers, concrete, cell-laden gels, and conductive inks [16][17][18][19][20][21]. To assist in understanding and optimizing yield stress materials for applications, rapid, reliable, and accurate measurements of the material behavior are required. Simultaneously, a key research aim of the field over the past 20 years has been to develop better descriptive and predictive constitutive models that capture the complex rheological behavior of these fluids including description of the full thixoelastoviscoplastic (TEVP) response (see, for example, [22][23][24]).

As a result of the complexities encountered in measuring the rheology of TEVP yield stress fluids, the vane has become the rheometric tool geometry of choice, as it prevents the slip of material and minimizes sample damage/alteration during the sample loading process [6]. The vane geometry initially was developed in the 1980's by civil engineers as a tool to quantify the yield stress of soils and thick clays. Seminal work by Nguyen and Boger adapted the vane for muds and slurries and derived a simple quantitative relationship between the torque imposed on the rotating vane and the resulting shear stress acting on the sample [10,25]. The vane subsequently has become a standard tool for measuring the yield stress of delicate materials and structured fluids [6].

The vane geometry most typically consists of four to six straight blades of equal length fanning out from a center point in a cruciform or hexagonal arrangement [6]. The vane is submerged inside a cup of the sample material and then rotated about its central axis; the rheometer records the torque and rotation angle. This rotation deforms an approximately cylindrical plug of material, generating an ideally axisymmetric stress field, while also restricting sample slip, which is a key issue for cylindrical Couette rotors [6]. The vane, despite its more complex geometry, has been used to impose a range of standard rheometric test protocols, including measurement of steady state flow curves, start-up of steady shear, creep/recoil, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) [12,21,26]. Systematic comparisons of rheological measurements made using vanes to those using other standard rheometric tools generally have found good numerical agreement between values measured with vanes and with other geometries. Meanwhile, any differences in measured values typically occur due to wall slip and differing sample history, affecting primarily large strain measurements and general level of repeatability in data measured with vanes compared to other geometries. In particular, we note the following specific examples: for bentonite, direct comparisons have revealed that cone-and-plate tests systematically underestimate yield stress as compared with vanes, due to thixotropy associated with sample loading [27]; for foams, SAOS measurements with vanes agree well with measurements made with parallel plate fixtures, while vanes induce less bubble coalescence [28]; for soft cheeses, SAOS measurements with a parallel plate geometry agree well with vanes, though only vanes were capable of imposing reproducible larger-amplitude strain deformations due to sample slip occurring against the parallel plates [29]. In direct comparisons of inter-and intralaboratory tests, yield stress measurements made with vanes in start-up of steady shear tests have been found to be more reproducible than measurements made by other tools including slump tests on inclined planes, or creep experiments or stress ramp tests with cones and textured concentric cylinders [30].

The shearing profile around the vane is axisymmetric only for certain materials and under specific flow conditions. Secondary flows arise when the viscosity is too low, resulting in recirculation between neighboring pairs of arms [31,32]; these are exacerbated when the powerlaw index of a shear thinning fluid is >0.5 (more Newtonian) [33]; and when the vane has too few arms to hold a given material securely (typically needing greater than three arms) [34]. For viscoelastic materials, this recirculation has been shown to cause a significant artificial increase in the apparent viscosity reported by the instrument [35]. Detailed theoretical and computational analysis of the region near a single knife-edge of a vane reveal that the stress field is singular at the tip, and consequently the stress field around a multi-arm vane tool shows spatially periodic variations for any material with Newtonian, yield stress, or linear elastic behavior [31,36,37].

Consequently, even when the streamlines in a sheared fluid sample are circular, instantaneous structural parameters characterizing the local properties of thixotropic fluids can be strongly influenced by the location of the blades, becoming non-axisymmetric with the vane rotation [37]. Despite these difficulties, vanes are particularly useful for ensuring repeatability of measurements and for characterizing structurally-sensitive materials. This is because vanes displace far less material and impose a much weaker deformation history during initial sample loading, which is particularly important for thixotropic samples [38]. With a cone-and-plate, parallel-plate, or concentric-cylinder tool configuration, the sample must be compressed and sheared to fill the thin gap between the two fixture surfaces. Compared to a bob, a vane can more easily be inserted into a cup that has been previously filled with a structured material, and the vane typically displaces less than 20% of the sample volume compared to a bob of equivalent radius. This results in more repeatable measurements and control of the material's initial shear history. Furthermore, use of vanes allows samples to be prepared and aged in containers for long waiting times before testing on the rheometer [27].

Alternatives to the vane geometry that have been proposed for yield stress fluids include paired helical blades for preventing sedimentation while measuring dense samples such as concrete with large aggregates, torsional mixers, and planetary rotating systems [39], along with other styles of test including penetration and slump tests [5,40]. Due to their easy insertion into fluids, fourarmed vanes also find wide-spread use in field tests for industrial measurements, with designs for "bucket rheometers" for concrete and industrial slurries powered by a hand drill [41] and a similar extended rod for in situ or "syn-eruptive" measurements of lava flows oozing from active vents, where the magnitude of the yield stress is a strong indicator of probability of eruption [42,43].

In the interest of allowing easier design and fabrication of rheometric tooling, Bikos and Mason recently introduced 3D-printed (3DP) cones and annular rings for rheometers as a costeffective approach to create bespoke parts [44]. Other researchers have used 3DP to make custom drag-reducing surfaces for viscous skin friction tests utilizing the rheometer motor and torque sensor [45]. In other fields, 3D printing, a subset of a class of processes broadly known as additive manufacturing, has become widespread for production of complex geometries from a vast library of possible base materials [46]. In the present case, 3DP is well-suited to create functional vanelike geometries, compared to other manufacturing methods, due to the need to produce fine (<1mm) features with very high aspect ratios that retain dimensional accuracy over O(cm) length scales [47].

In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and use of a 3D printed fractal-like vane geometry. The branching, tree-like fractal structure was optimized to give a large surface area and large number of contact edges with the test fluid, while the internal structure remains sparse in terms of displaced volume relative to a bob, in order to limit pre-shearing of a structurally-sensitive material during sample loading. In Section II, we discuss the relevant stress and strain fields for a generic vane geometry, combining and adjusting published expressions to propose a composite formula for converting torque to stress, incorporating variations in the number of arms, the vane geometry, and the influence of end effects from a vane with finite length. We also discuss the impact of design variations on the projected area displaced by the vane geometry, and on the stress profile around the vane geometry. In Section III, we discuss the design and manufacturing of vanes by stereolithographic 3D printing, using a methacrylate-based photopolymer to create vanes with fine (200 µm) feature resolution and with chemical compatibility with a broad range of solvents and sample materials. We also discuss a printable coupling to a common rheometer interface, and propose a design for textured 3D printed cups that assists in preventing sample slip at the outer walls, while also being detachable from the rheometer base for easy cleaning. In Section IV, we quantify the accuracy of the new designs by comparing vane measurements of Newtonian calibration oils and a simple (i.e., non-thixotropic) yield stress material (a Carbopol microgel) with reference measurements obtained in a roughened cone-and-plate fixture, and compare these results to our proposed torque scaling factors. In Section V, we use these vanes to perform start-up of steady shear flow measurements of the TEVP response of a Carbopol-based hair gel, a jammed emulsion (mayonnaise), and an alkaline carbon black-based battery slurry with pH 12. Following our conclusions in Section VI, we provide four appendices discussing in more detail (A) the stress field around the new vane geometries; (B) the definitions and selection of particular fractal structures; (C) the displaced area filled by vanes of different designs; and (D) how to ensure a vane meets acceptable standards for accurate and reproducible rheological measurements, with the goal of facilitating adoption of our design and fabrication method in other laboratories.

## II. THEORY

### A. Rheology of yield stress fluids

The generic term "yield stress fluid" typically applies to a fluid that exhibits a characteristic stress below which it may deform viscoelastically (i.e., as it creeps) but does not flow, and above which it flows steadily like a (typically shear-thinning) liquid. For further details, see the extensive reviews provided by [3,6,48,49]. In addition to the key role of a critical material stress, timedependent degradation and rebuilding of the underlying material structure may occur, leading to complex rheological responses that depend both on time and on sample history.

The simplest constitutive model appropriate for describing the steady flow curve of yield stress fluids is the Hershel-Bulkley model, [50] () 0

where  is the shear stress, y  is the yield stress in shear, k is the consistency index,  is the shear rate, and n is the power law index. When n = 1, this corresponds to a Bingham fluid, with k   being the plastic viscosity. While many more complex models exist which can account for viscoelastic responses below yield as well as time and rate-dependent thixotropic responses (ex., the soft glassy rheology model [24], the isotropic kinematic hardening model [23,26], and models by Saramito [51,52] and Coussot [53]), the simple Herschel-Bulkley viscoplastic model is sufficient for comparison with the results of steady state measurements presented here.

### B. Torque-shear stress and rotation rate-shear rate relations for the vane geometry

The 

and a rotation rate () t  , where the wall shear stress () wv R   . The conversion of torque to stress depends purely on the test geometry. In their original analysis, Nguyen and Boger used a cylindrical model for the yield surface and calculated the stress on the cylindrical yield surface enclosing the vane including the cylindrical wall and both end caps to the total torque:

where L is the finite length of the vane. The additional contribution from the thin rod holding the vane is neglected here, as our vane has 

This relationship enables an interconversion between the observable (torque) and the desired rheometric variable, i.e., the wall shear stress at the surface of the vane.  does not reach the outer wall of the cup ( yc RR  ). In the fully yielded case, the fluid is plastically yielded throughout the cup, and yc R R  and this necessitates the use of a different analysis [25].

In the present study, the chosen gap is large enough (or, equivalently, the applied torque is maintained at small enough values) that the fluid is only partially yielded for all measurements, which means that 2 ,max ( / / )

. We note that the yield surface reaches the outer wall in our system when the shear stress computed from equation (4) reaches a threshold value . As described by [25], this expression can be rearranged and integrated to obtain:

The relationship between rotation rate and stress depends on the specific (a priori unknown) constitutive response of the fluid sample in the gap, and not on geometry alone. However, when , and substituting the relationship between wall shear stress and torque derived in equation ( 4) then gives the shear rate at the vane surface to be

This expression depends on the actual stress-shear rate (or torque-rotation speed) relationship of the material being tested, and so only a prescribed rotation rate and not a prescribed shear rate may be imposed a priori for experiments on an uncharacterized material. Other expressions for calculating () r  from the imposed rotation rate  when the entire sample is yielded (i.e., when yc RR  ), or for materials without a yield stress are compared in [25,32,54].

For the specific case of measuring a viscous Newtonian fluid, the wall shear rate, w  , at the perimeter of the vane can be evaluated as [25]    

### C. Generalized torque-to-stress conversion relations for vane geometries

While the vane geometry is well suited for measuring the instantaneous torque y M (and the corresponding yield stress y  at the instant of yielding), the streamlines become noncircular when measuring strongly shear-thinning materials at higher shear rates, or for measuring viscous Newtonian fluids, due to secondary flows (i.e., slow recirculation of fluid eddies) between the vane arms [33]. Essentially, the fluid-filled space between each pair of vane arms functions as a liddriven cavity with a slow steady recirculating flow that contributes additional dissipation to the total measured torque. A design that occludes more internal space may be more suitable for these measurements, as was recognized even in early work by Keentok et al: "A more theoretically acceptable vane would be designed in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of secondary flows between the blades." [34]. Yet, this requires an intricate vane geometry (e.g., containing many thin blades), which is expensive to mold or machine, making their manufacture cost-prohibitive at that time.

In addition, the stress field in the sheared sample is non-uniform and localized around the perimeter at the edges of each arm of the vane. In fact, analysis by Atkinson and Sherwood for the stress field (in a Newtonian fluid or a linear elastic solid) near a knife-edge singularity in torsional deformation shows that at each arm tip, there is a stress singularity that scales inversely proportionally to the number of vane arms [31]. By increasing the number of tips in contact with outer fluid, the stress field becomes progressively more homogeneous along circles of constant radius from the vane center. To illustrate this, we evaluate the azimuthal shear stress  we find that the stress drops by 60% for a 4-armed vane, by 18% for a 12-armed vane, and has no drop between arms but increases 2% for a 24-armed vane.

Although the analysis leading to equations ( 2)-( 4) discussed above considers the torsional stress field in the test material to be axisymmetric, in reality the shearing stress varies in r and  and is spatially localized at the outermost contact edges between the vane and the fluid as indicated in Fig 2(a). In the 1990s, Sherwood et al. [36] simulated the influence of the number of arms, N, on a vane tool as well as end effects arising from 3D flow and showed that the measured torque, M, and the wall shear stress are related more accurately by the following expression by:

It is evident from this relationship that increasing the number of vane arms brings the stress closer to the homogeneous wall shear stress expected for a cylindrical bob ( 

We have combined and adjusted this 2D analytical solution with the 3D simulation result, guided by experimental data obtained with silicone oils and a simple yield stress fluid. We use these to develop two practical stress-torque conversion factors (denoted S  ) based on geometric features of the vane geometry that we can then compare with our experimental data. From equation ( 4), we can see that if we assume a cylindrical stress profile expression, then the appropriate torque conversion factor ( O S  ) is given by:

We expect this expression to perform well when the deformation in a sample is nearly ideally cylindrical (for example at stresses below and close to the yield stress, and for vanes with a large number of arms). By combining the scaling of equation ( 10) and the numerical calculations underpinning equation ( 9), we also construct the following N-dependent expression for the stress conversion factor:

We expect this expression to be more accurate for structurally-sensitive materials with rheology that depends on the local kinematics near each vane. By considering the typical reproducibility of experimental rheometric data with yield stress fluids and enumerating equations ( 11) and ( 12) for a range of N (with v LR ), we find N = 24 to be the lowest even-numbered vane geometry in which the difference between the two expressions varies by less than 5%, and this is the largest value of N used in the present study.

However, simply adding more arms also displaces and disturbs more material when the vane is inserted into a sample, which has been shown to lead to underestimations of the yield stress [55], and may make measurements on thixotropic fluids that exhibit a strong memory of their initial deformation history during loading less repeatable. To quantify this effect and explore it systematically, we define the occluded area fraction (OAF) as the cross-sectional area of fluid displaced by an N-arm vane normalized by the area of a circle with the same outer radius:

Computing numerical values of this expression obviously depends on N as well as the thickness t of each vane. For example, a 4-arm vane with a thickness of 0.13 v R (typical of commercial vanes) has an OAF of 4 0.13 / 0.16 16%    .

Our design objective, then, is to reduce recirculation of fluid between the vane arms and increase the shear stress homogeneity in the sample close to the vanes without substantially increasing the occluded area fraction of the vane. For this purpose, we propose a fractal design.

Certain classes of fractals have well-defined recursive branching structures that lead to particularly high surface area-to-volume ratio [56]. In particular, we explore finite Bethe lattice-like fractals The area minimization problem was approached through analysis of the area occluded by each profile. The different design families we compare were guided by results from a preprogrammed Steiner tree algorithm [57], which generates the fully optimal, global minimum length path spanning a set of input points. In this case, the input design was a set of N points spaced evenly around the perimeter of a circle with radius Rv plus one additional point at the center (corresponding to the spindle location). These computational results revealed the sparsest network connecting the N+1 points along with the lower bound of the achievable OAF for a given N (and fixed arm thickness, t). Further details of this analysis are included in Appendix C.

## III. DESIGN AND 3D PRINTING OF VANES AND RHEOMETER TOOLS

### A. Design of vane for stereolithography

Rheometric tools are typically manufactured via machining of aluminum or of stainless steel. The introduction of a new fractal-based vane geometry requires a manufacturing method that can achieve complex features without excessive cost, and that is capable of creating thin and closely-spaced features such as the profiles shown in Fig 2(d). 3D printing is exceptionally well suited for this task, as its layer-by-layer nature allows complex geometries to be created in three dimensions with, ideally, minimal post-processing or shaping. In particular, designs such as these extruded vanes that are geometrically complex along a single axis and without overhanging features can be printed with high quality using stereolithography [47]. Manufacturing thin, highaspect ratio cavities by other methods such as machining, injection molding, or casting would be more challenging [58].

We selected the overall dimensions and rheometer coupling of our fractal vanes based on the commercial vane (N = 4) available for the TA Instruments DHR series of rheometers with a diameter of 2 15 the rheometer allowed the vane to be printed entirely without a supporting structure, increasing printing speed and quality, as well as obviating the need for support removal. To enable this, the vanes were printed vertically, vane-end first (Figure 3c). We determined that this orientation ensured the best concentricity of the vane geometry with the printed rheometer coupling and best surface texture as it avoided consecutive layers giving a "stair stepping" texture on the surface and negating any imprecision in the x-y and z-stage calibrations (Fig 3d) Stereolithography, which locally cures photopolymer resin via a light-initiated chemical reaction, allows the use of polymers with wide chemical compatibility [60]. The methacrylate blend material we selected is compatible with solvents such as acetone, mild acids, and also strong bases (including at least one carbon black-based battery electrolyte with pH 12 that corrodes aluminum). The printed vanes have a cost of material of ~$1.90 (including the metal threaded insert). We previously determined the repeatability of stereolithography under similar printing parameters is 30 µm standard deviation in dimensions between prints [61]. Thus, even in the case in which the material to be tested slowly degrades and/or adheres to the vane, 3D printing is still an attractive solution. Relative to the value of an accurate measurement, the low cost of 3DP vanes may justify their single-time use.

### B. Design of the coupling for attachment to the rheometer

In order to robustly attach to a commercial rheometer, the printed vane geometry was designed to accommodate a threaded insert, rather than by including printed threads integral to the  

### C. 3D-printed cup with textured wall

We also designed a cup to complement the 3D printed vane, and serve as the sample holder.

The inner surface of the cup is textured to help prevent slip of the sheared sample at the outer wall, with square steps of 1 mm width by 1 mm depth, spaced apart by 2 mm. These dimensions were chosen to give similar spacing as the arms of the 24-armed fractal vanes and to promote infill of the material into the gaps between ribs (Fig 5a,b). In addition, the cup fastens onto the Peltier plate that is a standard lower fixture on the DHR or AR-G2. The Peltier plate holds it either by an interference fit of six protruding arms or by using the arms as guides and using double-sided tape under the base for a more adjustable hold, as a well-calibrated Peltier plate is orthogonal to the axis of the rotating spindle but is not necessarily concentric with it. The yielded area is set entirely by the location of the vane perimeter and extends radially outwards. Provided the yielded area does not reach the outer wall (i.e., provided the imposed stress is

), the cup shape and position only influences the spatial homogeneity of the linear viscoelastic deformation that occurs pre-yielding, with an effect proportional to the offset of the rotation axis (Appendix D).

Thus, for measurements of yield stress fluids with a wide-gap geometry, precise concentricity of the cup is not critical. The cup was designed for facile use with yield-stress fluids, which often are challenging to fill into the cup without bubbles and to clean out after an experiment, especially given the crenelated walls. As a result, the cup was designed to unscrew from the base, making it straightforward to access material in the cup for filling and cleaning (Fig 5c,d). As an added benefit, this means that a single base can be used interchangeably with several 3D printed cups that differ in height and diameter, or that are pre-filled with different fluid samples, as long as they use the same (custom) 3D-printed mating thread. This enables multiple samples to be pre-filled and conditioned with a controlled waiting time and thermal history, if desired, then mounted directly onto the rheometer just prior to testing.

## IV. RESULTS

Here, we compare measurements of viscous Newtonian oils and a simple yield stress fluid made using our family of vanes to measurements made with standard roughened cone-and-plane fixtures (which we assume to provide true reference values). Although flow curves and viscosity measurements of yield stress fluids often are reported as single values and single curves, the measurements in fact are inexact and repeated measurements commonly vary by more than a few percent for challenging materials. Our aim is to unambiguously compare the performance of a series of vane tools with repeated measurements made using standard cone-and-plate tools to quantify mean error and variability. We use these results also to compare performance among vane designs. Having determined the optimal designs, we then use a printed fractal vane to measure the transient rheological response of multiple TEVP materials.

### A. Measurements of viscous oils

A strain rate sweep experiment was performed on a high viscosity silicone oil (µ = 1.0 Pa.s at 25° C; Fig 6a-c) using a series of vane designs, and compared to the reference measurement made with a cone-and-plate geometry (Fig 6a-c). The measured rotation rate at each torque was converted to shear rate using equation (7) and the torque was converted to stress using equation ( 12), the N-dependent expression. , with the fractal design having the smallest error at 1.4% (Fig 6e,f). Because of the large torque values for this viscous fluid and the small variance in the shear stress data for a well-behaved Newtonian oil, the viscosity values measured with the 3-arm vane, 4-arm vane, and 24-arm ribbed vane were statistically distinct from the cone-and-plate measurement (t-test; p<0.05), while only the results obtained using the fractal vane (N=24) were not statistically different from the reference curve.

Below the range of shear rates used for this comparison, systematic errors must be recognized. At low shear rates, data becomes noisy when the torque measured by the rheometer reaches the minimum limit of sensitivity (≈10µN.m). Using a vane with more arms increases the window accessible for accurate measurement. The useful range of data was expanded in the low shear rate regime as the number of arms on the vane increased (Fig 6a). A higher number of arms N increases the wetted area of contact between the fluid and the fixture, increasing the conversion factor S  and leading to a larger torque at low shear rates, thus extending the minimum resolvable stress.

The measurements were repeated using a low viscosity silicone oil (µ = 0.010 Pa.s; Fig 6df). As before, the minimum torque sensitivity of the rheometer (10 µN.m) was observed to limit the useful data range at low shear rates. In addition, due to the much lower fluid viscosity raising the Reynolds number characterizing the flow, inertial recirculation between vane arms becomes significant at high shear rates. Within these limiting bounds, For the low viscosity oil, the variation in the average viscosity measured by all tested vanes was within 8% of the true value, and was less than 5% for the fractal design (Fig 6b,c). However, the measured viscosity was not statistically different from the value measured with a cone-andplate fixture for any vane (t-test; p>0.05).

### A. Measurement of a simple yield stress fluid

Carbopol is a hydrogel composed of crosslinked poly(acrylic acid) microgel particles that swell in neutral or basic pH to form a physically-jammed microstructure and which, providing the preparation is done carefully, convey a remarkably "simple" yield stress behavior that has been well-studied [4,26,63]. Furthermore, we use a Carbopol-based hair gel (Clear Ice Ultra Hold, Ampro Pro Style) that we found to show simple yield stress behavior. Also, this type of material does not exhibit shear banding, making it useful for calibration [7]. We measured the steady-state flow curve with four 3D printed vanes (N = 3, 4, 12-fractal, 24-fractal, as well as with a solid cylindrical bob) and compared measurements with the reference flow curve obtained using a roughened cone-and-plate geometry. The cone and plate were both roughened by attaching a micropatterned adhesive sandpaper (Trizact A5; 3M), which removes the effect of slip for all measurements. For our measurements, the vanes were inserted into the material until a lower gap equal to v R was obtained between the bottom of the vane and the lower surface of the cup, and similarly a depth of at least v R of sample was ensured between the top of the vane and the sample surface.

When using the vane fixtures, the torque measured at each rotation rate increases with the number of outer contact points with the fluid, as expected (Fig 7a). We converted the measured rotation rate to the shear rate in the material at the edge of the vane using equation (7). As shown in Fig 7b, the resulting conversion is rate-dependent rather than a single constant factor, but the curves behave similarly for all vanes. To convert the shear rate precisely, we fit each data set to a functional form c M a b   and inserted that formula into equation ( 7) for conversion. We found other methods, such as pointwise evaluation of derivatives using centered difference formulae, were substantially less accurate -particularly at low shear rates.

Next, torque was converted to stress using either equation ( 11 The total error is much lower when the N-dependent stress conversion given by for equation ( 12) is employed, standard errors are only 0.8-3% and the data fall well within the most likely experimental window expected from the cone-and-plate values (grey shaded region in Fig 7f-h). In comparison, the total error obtained from using equation (11), which assumes an axisymmetric stress field, results in standard errors up to 4-23% in the final flow curves. We further observe that this total error decreases systematically as N increases, to a minimum for the fractal vane with N = 24 (Fig 7f ), indicating that for the 24-arm vane, the stress field is well-approximated by a cylindrical expression, confirming one of our major design objectives. Our results further support the assertion of Keentok [34] that a 3-armed vane is insufficient for accurate measurement of flow curves in yield stress fluids.  (f,h) Mean error and the range of error for each vane for three repeated measurements, averaged along the entire curve, where the mean percent error is labeled. The background grey bar shows the range of repeated cone-and-plate reference measurements. The error from the cylinder is represented for both the entire curve including slip (light purple bar) as well as for the partial curve without slip at higher shear rates (dark purple bar). Computing the sample stress using the Ndependent expression (h) leads to the lowest overall error for all vanes (excluding the 3-armed vane) with <1% mean error for the fractal and 4-armed vanes, indicating the universal applicability of this conversion expression (equation ( 12)).

### B. Direct comparison of torque/stress conversion factors with models

In order to determine the best expression to predict the torque/shear stress conversion factors, we calculated the optimal value of S  to translate the flow curves for a series of fluids exactly onto the reference curve with zero average error over a range of shear rates , as well as a more complex thixotropic yield stress fluid (mayonnaise), which is discussed in more detail later. We observe agreement with equation ( 12), as well as progressively smaller error bars in the data obtained using vanes with a higher number of arms N . the convergence of both expressions at high N allows data taken with a 24-armed vane to compare well with the expected values of S  for both expressions.

FIG. 8. The optimal torque conversion factors calculated from experimental data for three different fluids were compared with the torque conversions factors computed using the two expressions in equations ( 11) and ( 12) for a series of N-armed vanes. Separately, we also show the conversion factor expected for a Couette "bob" (cylinder) with N .

### C. Start-up of steady shear flow

Elasto-visco-plastic yield stress fluids also have a characteristic viscoelastic response to start-up of steady shear. Initially, the shear stress increases monotonically with imposed strain before the onset of irreversible plastic yielding and flow. The initial stress growth may be linear, indicating Hookean linear elasticity, or sublinear, indicating a viscoelastic solid response. At a critical apparent strain, the material will begin to fluidize and flow plastically. Eventually the flow will develop a terminal, constant stress at or above the yield stress. If the yield stress fluid is thixotropic, there is often an overshoot before the stress decreases to a constant terminal value [5].

Depending on the imposed shear rate, it will take a different length of time to reach the yielding point. However, in many systems we expect the curves for different shear rates will superpose when plotted against an apparent strain, consistent with a dominant elastic response. Having determined that the N = 24 fractal arm vane gives optimal results for a range of fluids, we now perform start-up of steady shear tests on three yield stress materials using a 24-armed fractal vane.

### i. Carbopol

Carbopol was loaded into the textured cup shown in (b) For all imposed rates, the Carbopol shows an initial elastic response followed by plastic yielding at a constant terminal flow stress. (c) When the data are plotted using the apparent strain t   rather than the experimental step time on the abscissa, they superimpose, revealing a consistent material response. In all cases, the material elastically deforms until it yields at a critical apparent strain 𝜃 𝑦 ≈ 0.2 𝑟𝑎𝑑 and immediately plateaus at an almost constant value of the stress. The inset shows an optical micrograph of the material microstructure.

### ii. Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise (Hellmann's Squirtable) is a vinegar-and-egg-based emulsion of oil in water (Fig 10a inset). Over time, the fat globules coalesce and particle flocs aggregate, yet imposed stress breaks up structures and/or induces particle migration and mild phase separation [64][65][66], thus resulting in a thixotropic yield stress response. This makes rheometry of such structured materials very difficult as they show sensitivity to their entire history, including the loading step required to place a sample into the rheometer. For this reason, the mayonnaise samples were held in the original off-the-shelf container for experiments. To investigate the thixotropy of the mayonnaise, a conditioning step was performed to reset the material history after the vane was inserted using a pre-shear rate -1 0.1 s   for 10 s, followed by a waiting time, w t , varying from 3 s to 10,000 s.

Last, we imposed a constant rotation rate of

for times w tt  . The resulting material response to this pre-shear history is shown in Fig 10(a). For all waiting times, the initial viscoelastic response is a power law with slope less than unity, indicating strain-dependent plastic losses [67].

Subsequently, the material yields, showing a stress overshoot that depends strongly on the waiting time, w t , before approaching a steady state terminal shear stress. This thixotropic overshoot is indicative of progressive structural buildup following the cessation of preshearing.

The initial power law characteristics of the transient stress growth are common in many microstructured food gels [68]. One way of compactly modeling this response is by using a Scott-Blair fractional element to quantify the rate-dependent material properties. This model has two parameters: a viscoelastic quasi-modulus , and a fractional exponent  characterizing the order of the fractional derivative [69]. For instance, 0   indicates a purely elastic response, and is the point at which the stress first reaches a value equal to its terminal stress. For more details on this fractional model and related analysis, refer to [67][68][69][70]. The value of the quasi-property, or scale factor in equations ( 14)-( 15) increases from  600 Pa.s α at w t = 3s to  1080 Pa.s α , beyond which it plateaus for w t ≥ 100 s (Fig 10b). The fractional exponent similarly decreases from 0.46 to 0.14, beyond which it plateaus after 100 s, consistent with the increasingly solid-like nature of the material that occurs during restructuration. Similarly, the yield strain (at which , changes in the viscoelastic solid properties were more gradual while (c) the magnitude of the stress overshoot began to increase more rapidly, indicating a complex multiscale reformation of the microstructure between tests.

### iii. Aqueous Battery Slurry

Finally, we measured the yielding characteristics of an aqueous battery slurry composed of Carbopol (Lubrizol, USA; 1 wt%), carbon black (acetylene black, Chevron, USA; 6 wt%), and 7 molar KOH (30 wt%); this mixture results in a paste with pH = 12. The strong alkalinity increases electronic conductivity, improving performance as a battery material [72][73][74]. It also causes this slurry material to corrode many metals including commercial steel rheometer vanes. While the dispersed carbon black discolored our 3D printed resin, the vane did not show evidence of physical degradation even after 20 hours of experiments.

As with the other materials, a steady rotation rate was imposed (10 -4 rad/s), without modification between trials. There was no conditioning pre-shear, because no combination of speeds and equilibration times were found to "reset" the material to give a repeatable initial stress response (i.e., the material ages irreversibly). The waiting time was therefore held to a constant value of wait t  1000 s between each test. As shown in Fig 11, the initial stress growth is weakly sublinear in strain but remains almost constant with the number of times the sample is sheared.

Fitting the data with equation (15) gives 430 Pa.s   and  = 0.17 

## V. CONCLUSION

We have introduced a family of fractal vane geometries, characterized by the number of arms N, that can readily be manufactured using cost-effective desktop stereolithographic 3D

printing. The design of this new class of fixtures gives a larger surface area-to-volume ratio to the tool, leading to improved axisymmetry of the yield surfaces at the point of yielding and a more accurate determination of the yield stress.

Specifically, we have shown that vanes and textured cups made by desktop stereolithography can be used to obtain rheological measurements that are consistent with "reference" measurements made by machined cone-and-plate geometries with carefully roughened surfaces to eliminate slip. We have also presented expressions for interconverting between measured torque and sample shear stress for a general vane with any number of equally spaced arms, as well as for converting between rotation rate and shear rate for a wide-gapped vane-in-cup configuration. For completeness we repeat these expressions again below.

The torque-to-shear stress conversion is (from equation ( 12)

and the shear rate conversion at steady state is (from equation ( 7))

where ln / ln d M d  is computed from the measured torque-speed curve for the sample under study.

Fabrication of the vanes by 3D printing enabled us to explore various vane designs, and to validate these expressions against experiments. Stress conversion factors derived for an N-arm straight-armed vane accurately convert measurements even from a fractal structure with N circumferential points; this is due to the presence of the yield stress, which "cloaks" or hides the internal structure of the vane from the yielded region [75], so that only the number of outer contact edges, and not the internal structure of the vane, affects the yield profile (Fig 2a). The remainder of the fluid plug trapped between the N arms rotates with the vane as a rigid body.

Moreover, vanes made by 3D printing of photopolymer are inexpensive, disposable, and chemically compatible with a wide range of solvents. The total runout of the vanes was measured to be 0.4-0.7 mm at the lower tip of the vane after fitting the printed vanes with an M4 nut as a threaded insert, and without any other post-processing. The printable rheometer coupling is readily adaptable to future design innovations and other rheometer-mounting systems. Such concepts may include designs to minimize moments of inertia, to fit various rheometer and cup geometries, to sharpen or taper the lower surface of each vane arm for easier insertion into soft solids, and to adjust texture, compliance, or porosity for tailoring of specific measurement needs.

We have shown that vanes with consistent, reliable dimensions can be manufactured using a commercially-available desktop 3D printer, yet when using a new 3D printer or a new print material it is always prudent to re-evaluate the chemical compatibility and dimensional accuracy of each printed vane. This can be done using standard alignment calibration fixtures, or by making measurements using a viscous Newtonian calibration oil and comparing these measurements to reference standards, as we have shown in Fig 6.

The average value of the wall shear stress acting on the sample has to be computed from the measured torque, which depends on the (unknown) constitutive model describing the test sample, and so there is unlikely to be a singular "best" vane design for best measurement of all materials. As we and previous researchers have found, viscous Newtonian fluids are more sensitive to internal structural details of the vane which can enhance or inhibit recirculation, whereas yield stress fluids are more sensitive to the number of outer contact edges N. As a result, in this work we have considered in detail two key design features; (i) the stress field homogeneity, as shown in 

### VI. VII. APPENDIX A. Full field stress distribution around N-bladed vane

In 1992, C. Atkinson and colleagues analytically calculated the complete two-dimensional stress field around an infinitely long vane with N infinitely thin straight arms drawn from the center to the perimeter of a circle of radius R = 1 using the Wiener-Hopf method of solid mechanics [31]. We apply their results here. In particular, for the case of plane strain, the shear stress is  

Here, the coordinate system is a local polar coordinate system with origin at the vane tip and 0   aligned outwards along the thin straight arm with radius  as shown in to include the effect of each blade to the stress around the first neighboring arm but no further. These truncations generate an integrated shear stress that agrees well with the overall torque equation presented in [31].

### B. Fractal design

The fractal designs considered here are based on finite Bethe lattices. They can be parametrized by the number of initial branches from the center (Z) the number of layers or generations (G) and the number of new branches emerging from a single branch with each successive generation (which is always two here). 

### C. Occluded Area Fraction (OAF) of a vane

For a vane with N straight arms of constant thickness t radiating from the center point, the total occluded area is approximately  While the Steiner tree is optimal, a basic fractal and ribbed structure are only 4% more spacefilling, and would be considered "good" designs compared to the straight-armed design, which fills 30% more space. In general, if ease of insertion of the vane is a high priority for material tests, However, the occluded area fraction is not the only essential design criterion. The more structured, space-filling fractals are more suitable than the hollow ribbed structures both for limiting recirculation (by minimizing the distance between any two nearest walls) and for increasing mechanical strength against torsional deformation of the vane features during imposed shearing in stiff materials.
