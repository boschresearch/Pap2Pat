                        "It is well accepted that the treatment of any disease is easier and more effective if an underlying pathology is diagnosed as early as possible. For some diseases early diagnosis (preferably before the appearance of clear clinical symptoms) is critically important because of pathology transition into a more advanced, sometimes irreversible, stage. For example, one of the major problems for drug development and treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative diseases is their late clinical manifestation and diagnosis due to high compensatory potentials of the brain. As a result, these diseases are usually diagnosed when many neurons are already dead and currently the best case scenario is the prevention of pathology worsening, not a real recovery. Cancer is another example, since treatment of the metastatic stage of the disease is much more problematic than the treatment of the primary tumor. There are many other pathologies of this kind, but again the treatment of any disease is more effective if it is diagnosed earlier.",
                        "There are several basic types of clinical tests: (i) genetic tests that help to predict predisposition to a particular disease; (ii) screening tests, which are applied to a large population for early detection of a disease, preferably prior to its clinical manifestation; (iii) diagnostic tests, which are applied when a person has clinical symptoms of a disease or when the pathology has been detected by a screening test; (iv) molecular predictive tests that should predict the disease outcome and drug sensitivity.",
                        "Screening tests are most important for the early detection of a disease. It is true not only for spontaneous diseases but also for genetically linked pathologies, for which high chances of getting a disease are predicted by genetic testing. Ideally, everybody should undergo regular screening for all possible life threatening and many other diseases. There have been numerous attempts to develop tests for early detection of various diseases and different screening tests are currently performed for specific risk groups. For example, periodic colonoscopy is recommended to people over 50 years old, Pap smears are recommended to women and the PSA test to men for early detection of the cervical and prostate cancer, respectively. A main advantage of these tests is their disease-specificity, but at the same time it is their serious disadvantage because each test addresses only one particular pathology. However, there are many hundreds of human diseases, and it is difficult to imagine that such specific screening tests would be developed for all of those pathologies. Moreover, even if specific tests for early detection of all human diseases have been developed, it is highly unlikely that such tests would be used for screening purposes, especially for relatively rare diseases due to economic factors. Because screening tests for each particular disease address large populations their specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) are very important. For example, if a screening test for a relatively common disease (1:10,000) is 100% sensitive and 99% specific, which is almost impossible to achieve, and 1 million people are screened, 100 cases would be detected correctly but about 10,000 people would receive false positive results. Obviously, such outcome would cause emotional distress for these people as well as significant financial consequences for additional tests."

                        "As specified in the Background Section, above, there is a great need in the art for new screening tests. According to the current paradigm for screening test development and its clinical application, one of the main features of such test should be its high disease specificity. However, as mentioned above there are many hundreds of diseases and screening for each particular disease is principally impossible. The present invention proposes a significant paradigm shift: development and implementation of one or a small number of universal screening tests (USTs), which specifically detect a pathology of any particular organ system, organ, tissue and/or cell type, without diagnosing a particular disease. Such USTs should be performed periodically for any given subject for an early, preferably at clinically asymptomatic stage, and then more specific tests can be used for a more specific diagnosis. The USTs as described herein would improve disease diagnosis and treatment, and significantly decrease medical expenses. Also, the USTs as described herein would make tests for rare diseases more targeted since they will be applied to much smaller populations preselected by UST and, therefore, will be more economically practical.",
                        "Because UST will address a large population (preferably everyone), its first important feature is minimal invasiveness. The present invention proposes to register various physiological and pathological processes in particular organs, tissues and even cell types by analysis of respective biomarkers in bodily fluids that can be obtained by non-invasive or minimally invasive methods, such as, e.g., plasma/serum, urine, or saliva. Secondly, UST cannot be based on the inducing factor or pathogenesis of diseases, since there are too many of them. Thirdly, to be widely used, UST should not be very expensive, which, in particular, means that it has to utilize a limited number of biomarker types that can be analyzed by the same technique.",
                        "Biomarkers used for UST should have a set of parameters that make them suitable for such type of a test:\n\n\n- - 1. Cell/tissue/organ-specificity or significant enrichment (e.g., at\n    least 5 times higher concentration as compared to other\n    cells/tissues/organs).\n  - 2. Ability to be secreted into extracellular space and to pass\n    various barriers within the body.\n  - 3. Presence in detectable amounts in bodily fluids that can be\n    obtained with minimal invasiveness.\n  - 4. Stability.\n  - 5. Detectability with high sensitivity and specificity at a\n    relatively low cost.",
                        "The following classes of molecules can be of potential use for UST:\n\n\n- - 1. Proteins.\n  - 2. mRNA and mRNA fragments.\n  - 3. miRNA.\n  - 4. DNA fragments\n  - 5. DNA methylation.\n  - 6. Lipids.\n  - 7. Sugars.",
                        "However, some of these potential tissue-specific biomarkers have serious disadvantages, which make their use impractical or even impossible. For example, DNA methylation, lipids, and sugars are not sufficiently specific to differentiate between various tissue and cell types. Besides, DNA fragments appear in the extracellular space and in the bloodstream mainly from dying cells (Lichtenstein et al., Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 2001, 945:239-249) and, thus, circulating cell-free DNA cannot be used to detect pathology stages, which are not accompanied by cell death. Proteins and mRNA are better candidates for UST due to their higher tissue-specificity/enrichment (Diez-Roux et al., PLOS Biology. 2011, 9:e1000582). However, mRNA are large molecules, they are easily degraded by nucleases, and so only short fragments of these molecules appear in the bloodstream. This does not exclude their use as biomarkers for UST but makes test development more difficult. Proteins are good candidates but current methods for their detection are significantly less sensitive than nucleic acid detection techniques. Also, many proteins are large molecules and are not able to cross cellular membrane and other barriers.",
                        "The present invention proposes to use miRNA biomarkers in the UST for the following reasons: miRNA are small molecules, they can appear in the extracellular space, cross brain, kidney, and placenta barriers, appear in various bodily fluids, are stable, and existing methods for their analysis are very specific and sensitive. Most importantly, miRNA constitute a large class of diverse molecules with at least some miRNA being enriched in some organ systems, organs, tissues and/or cells, thus providing molecular markers for all parts of the body.",
                        "MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of non-coding RNAs whose final product (mature miRNA) is an approximately 22 nt functional RNA molecule. They play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to complementary regions of messenger transcripts to repress their translation or regulate degradation (Griffiths-Jones Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, 34, Database issue: D140-D144). Frequently, one miRNA can target multiple mRNAs and one mRNA can be regulated by multiple miRNA targeting different regions of the 3\u2032 UTR. Once bound to an mRNA, miRNA can modulate gene expression and protein production by affecting mRNA translation and stability (e.g., Baek et al., Nature. 2008, 455:64; Selbach et al., Nature. 2008, 455:58; Ambros, Nature. 2004, 431:350-355; Bartel, Cell. 2004, 116:281-297; Cullen, Virus Research. 2004, 102:3-9; He et al. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004, 5:522-531; and Ying et al., Gene. 2004, 342:25-28). There are other classes of less characterized small RNAs (reviewed in Kim, Mol. Cells, 2005, 19: 1-15). Many of miRNA are specific to or over-expressed in certain organs/tissues/cells (See, e.g., Hua et al., BMC Genomics 2009, 10:214; Liang et al., BMC Genomics. 2007, 8:166; Landgraf et al., Cell. 2007, 129:1401-1414; Lee et al., RNA. 2008, 14:35-42). Due to their small size, miRNA can cross the blood-brain, kidney, and placental barriers into bodily fluids where they are sufficiently stable (Rosenfeld et al., Nature Biotech. 2008, 26:462-469; Mitchell et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008, 105: 10513-10518; Chen et al., Cell Res. 2008, 18:997-1006; Chim et al., Clin. Chem. 2008, 54:482-490; De Smaele et al., Brain Res. 2010, 1338:100-111; Fichtlscherer et al., Circ. Res. 2010, 107:677-684; Scholer et al., Exp. Hematol. 2010, 38:1126-1130). Analysis of cell/tissue-specific miRNA in bodily fluids was proposed for detection of in vivo cell death (U.S. Patent Pub. No 20090081640; Laterza et al., Clin Chem. 2009, 55:1977-1983). The increase of concentrations of circulating cell-free liver-enriched miRNA in the bloodstream has been demonstrated in several studies (Zhang et al., Clin Chem. 2010, 56:1830-1838; Xu et al., Mol Carcinogenesis. 2011, 50:136-142). For example, the levels of liver-enriched miRNA-122a go up in serum of patients with hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinomas, and the authors come to a conclusion that due to this non-specificity for a particular disease these miRNA cannot be used as biomarkers for HCC (Zhang et al., Clin Chem. 2010, 56:1830-1838; Li et al., Cancer Res. 2010, 70:9798-9807). On the contrary, the present invention demonstrates that such disease non-specificity of the organ/tissue/cell-enriched miRNA is a significant advantage when they are used as biomarkers for UST development.",
                        "Expression and concentrations of miRNA are regulated by various physiological and pathological signals. Some of miRNA are characteristic of a particular pathology, such as hypoxia (Loscalzo, J. Clin. Invest. 2010, 120: 3815-3817; Pocock, Pflugers Arch. 2011, 461:307-315), inflammation (Tili et al., Int. Rev. Immunol. 2009, 28:264-284; Davidson-Moncada et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2010, 1183:183-194; Roy and Sen, Physiol. Genomics. 2011, 43:557-565), or carcinogenesis (Budhu et al., J. Hematol. Oncol. 2010, 3:37; Zen and Zhang, Med. Res. Rev. 2012, 32:326-348). This phenomenon makes it reasonable to include such miRNA as biomarkers into the USTs of the invention. An increase of these miRNA concentrations in bodily fluids will indicate the presence of a respective general pathology in the body without localizing it to a particular organ, tissue or cell type. Generally speaking, this would be the same approach as proposed above for organ/tissue-enriched miRNA: organ/tissue-enriched miRNA will help to detect a pathology in a particular organ or tissue; on the other hand, miRNA characteristic of a particular general pathology will help to detect the presence of this pathology somewhere in the body without indicating a specific organ/tissue involved. A combined use of miRNA biomarkers which are enriched in an organ system, organ, tissue, and/or cell type, and miRNA biomarkers characteristic of a particular general pathology will provide a more precise diagnosis, namely the presence of a particular pathology in a particular organ or tissue or cell type. For example, increased concentrations of miRNA characteristic of hypoxia in plasma, combined with increased concentrations of miRNA enriched in the heart, will provide more specific diagnosis of heart ischemia obtained by the UST.",

                        "The present invention is based on the idea of shifting the paradigm in the area of clinical screening and diagnostics from disease-specific screening tests to the Universal Screening Test(s) (UST), which will detect pathology of a particular organ system, such as gastrointestinal, nervous, hematological, etc., or of a particular organ or tissue or cell type, but will be disease-non-specific. Additionally such test will be capable to differentiate some broad types of pathologic processes, e.g. inflammatory diseases and tumors. After the pathology is detected, disease-specific tests can be applied for a more specific diagnosis. Such a test(s) can also be used for drug screening as well as for evaluating toxicity of various compounds and environmental factors (e.g. during drug development or clinical trials). The instant invention is based on the use of organ system-, organ-, tissue-, and/or cell type-enriched miRNA in bodily fluids as biomarkers of organ and/or tissue and/or cell pathology, description of the basis for such miRNA selection, and the methods of the UST interpretation. The UST of the invention can also include miRNA biomarkers for some general pathological processes, such as, e.g., hypoxia, inflammation, carcinogenesis, etc.",
                        "The present invention provides a novel noninvasive or minimally invasive method for early, preferably before clinical manifestation, detection of pathological changes (without defining a specific disease) in an organ system or in a particular organ/tissue/cell type in a subject, said method comprising determination of the levels of organ system/organ/tissue-enriched miRNA in a bodily fluid (e.g. plasma, serum, urine, saliva, or other bodily fluid) of said subject as compared to a control. Specifically, the method comprises:",
                        "a. measuring levels of miRNAs enriched in various organ systems/organs/tissues/cell types in a bodily fluid sample collected from the subject;\n\nb. measuring levels of preselected normalizer miRNAs in the same bodily fluid sample collected from the subject;\n\nc. calculating the ratios of the levels of the miRNAs measured in steps (a) and (b);\n\nd. comparing the ratios of the levels of the miRNAs calculated in step (c) with the corresponding control ratios, and\n\ne. (i) identifying the subject as being afflicted with a pathology of a particular organ system/organ/tissue/cell type when the ratios of the levels of the miRNAs enriched in said organ system to their respective miRNA normalizers calculated in step (c) are higher than the corresponding control ratios or (ii) identifying the subject as not being afflicted with a pathology of said organ system/organ/tissue/cell type when the ratios of the levels of the miRNAs enriched in said organ system to their respective miRNA normalizers calculated in step (c) are not higher than the corresponding control ratios.",
                        "If positive for a pathology, such UST should be followed by tests specific for various known pathologies of the organ system/organ/tissue/cell type identified by UST.",
                        "The present invention also provides methods for selecting potential miRNA biomarkers. To reflect pathological changes in a particular organ system, organ, tissue, or cell type such biomarkers should be, first, enriched in one of those organ systems, organs, or tissues, and second, their concentrations in bodily fluids should be high enough to be detectable. Although not all miRNA have currently been identified and organ/tissue expression profiles for many of them are not known, published data (See, e.g., Hua et al., BMC Genomics 2009, 10:214; Liang et al., BMC Genomics. 2007, 8:166; Landgraf et al., Cell. 2007, 129:1401-1414; Lee et al., RNA. 2008, 14:35-42; http://ferrolab.dmi.unict.it/miro/; http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenomir/) are sufficient to formulate major principles for selecting potential biomarkers:\n\n\n- - 1, organ system/organ/tissue/cell type-enrichment. Although some\n    miRNA are highly enriched in a particular organ or tissue, e.g.\n    miR-122 in the liver and miR-124 in the brain, there is no known\n    miRNA, which is 100% specific for one organ or tissue. Of course,\n    the higher is miRNA enrichment in a given organ\n    system/organ/tissue/cell type as compared to all other organ\n    systems/organs/tissues/cell types, the better potential as a\n    biomarker it has. Practically, if miRNA concentration in one organ\n    is at least 4-5 times higher than in others, they can be selected as\n    potential biomarkers for UST. For many organs, such miRNA can be\n    found in the literature (See, e.g., Hua et al., BMC Genomics 2009,\n    10:214; Liang et al., BMC Genomics. 2007, 8:166; Landgraf et al.,\n    Cell. 2007, 129:1401-1414; Lee et al., RNA 2008, 14:35-42;\n    http://ferrolab.dmi.unict.it/miro/;\n    http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/phenomir/). Table 1 represents\n    miRNA enriched in various organs according to numerous published\n    data. One can see that some miRNA are enriched in different organs\n    of the same organ system. This is especially characteristic of\n    gastrointestinal, nervous, genital, and hematological organs (Table\n    2). Using these miRNA allows to design a test that will detect\n    pathology in those systems but not in a particular organ. At the\n    same time, there are miRNA enriched in one-two organs of a system,\n    and these miRNA can be used for tests that can define the location\n    of the pathology more precisely. The list of these miRNA is\n    presented in the third column of Table 2. There are also miRNA\n    enriched in two or even more organs, which usually developed during\n    embryogenesis from the same cell types. In such cases the increase\n    of the miRNA concentration in bodily fluid cannot be interpreted\n    unambiguously. However, combination of several miRNA enriched in\n    different sets of organs resolves this problem, and the present\n    invention also includes a computer implemented method for analysis\n    of data obtained with such several miRNA. It is also important to\n    note that miRNA enrichment in the second organ will not\n    significantly affect the test results, if chances of those miRNA to\n    appear in bodily fluids are low. For example, many miRNA are\n    enriched (in addition to other organs) in the skin, but if those\n    miRNA are located in epidermis their chances of appearing in the\n    bloodstream from the skin are very low, and the method of the\n    invention uses them.\n  - 2. miRNA expression level. The test development is easier and its\n    sensitivity is higher if the concentration of a potential miRNA\n    biomarker(s) in the target organ system/organ/tissue/cell type is\n    sufficiently high, since one can expect that more miRNA biomarker\n    molecules appear in bodily fluids. Thus, if there is a choice\n    between many potential miRNA biomarkers, those miRNA should be\n    selected, which not only are enriched in the target but are also\n    highly expressed (e.g., \u22671000 copies per cell). This is especially\n    important for small organs or their parts or specific cell types\n    within organs, such as pancreatic \u03b1-cell islets. It does not mean\n    that miRNA which are not highly expressed cannot be used for the UST\n    development but the detection of miRNA expressed at low levels may\n    need larger volumes of bodily fluids and more sensitive techniques\n    for miRNA quantitation. At the same time, since miRNA concentration\n    in a bodily fluid also depends on the effectiveness of its secretion\n    from cells into extracellular space and transport to the bodily\n    fluid (see next section), as many as possible organ\n    system/organ/tissue/cell type-enriched miRNA should be analyzed for\n    the experimental selection of the most promising biomarkers.\n  - 3. miRNA secretion. There are many ways for cell-free miRNA to\n    appear in bodily fluids (Hunter et al., PLoS ONE. 2008, 3:e3694;\n    Wang et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2010, 38:7248-7259; Pigati et al.,\n    PLoS ONE. 2010, 5:e13515; Gupta et al., Circ. Cardiovasc. Genet.\n    2010, 3:484-488; Iguchi et al., Commun Integr. Biol. 2010,\n    3:478-481; Kosaka et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2010, 285:17442-17452).\n    miRNA can appear in extracellular space and then in bodily fluids as\n    a result of: (i) cell death and cellular membrane\n    permeabilization; (ii) destruction of some cellular compartments,\n    such as axons, dendrites, and spines in neurons; (iii) exocytosis\n    (Skog et al. Nat Cell Biol., 2008, 10:1470-1476); (iv) blebbing\n    (Charras et al., Biophys. J. 2008, 94:1836-1853; Fackler, Grosse, J.\n    Cell Biol. 2008, 181:879-884); (v) secretion of free or\n    protein-bound miRNA (Wang et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2010,\n    38:7248-7259). The latter mechanism provides for more than 50% of\n    cell-free miRNA into extracellular medium from live cells. The\n    secretion of miRNA is selective and the ratios of various miRNA\n    concentrations in cells and extracellular medium are different. The\n    selectivity of the miRNA secretion is very important for selecting\n    potential biomarkers. Since the mechanisms of miRNA secretion from\n    normal cells and during pathology development (Rabinowits et al.\n    Clin Lung Cancer, 2009, 10:42-46) has not been investigated, it is\n    necessary to analyze more miRNA, keeping in mind that some of them,\n    which look promising due to high expression and enrichment in a\n    target organ/tissue can be secreted at a low level and vice versa.\n    Also it was recently demonstrated that some miRNA, e.g., miR-451 and\n    miR-1246, which are secreted at a very low level from normal cells,\n    can be secreted much more effectively from pathological cells\n    (Pigati et al. PLoS ONE, 2010, 5:e13515). These miRNA can also be\n    analyzed as potential biomarkers even if they are not highly\n    enriched in a particular organ system, organ or tissue, since their\n    combination with more organ/tissue-specific miRNA will provide\n    additional information useful for detecting a pathology.",
                        "It is important to remember that many miRNA have not been discovered yet and the expression profiles of many recently discovered miRNA in various tissues have not been analyzed. In addition, many organs, tissues, and especially cell types were not tested for expression of already known miRNA. Thus, although UST development can be initiated on the basis of already published data for many organs and tissues, additional search for new biomarkers will increase the informative value of UST. First, the miRNA expression profile of all known miRNA in various organ systems/organs/tissues/cell types should be analyzed to define new organ system-/organ-/tissue-enriched miRNA (e.g., using RT-PCR, which currently is the most sensitive and least variable technique for miRNA quantitative measurement). Second, the expression profiles of all newly discovered miRNA should be analyzed as described above. Third, since all organs are composed of various cell types, the expression of miRNA enriched in particular organs should be additionally analyzed to find out the cell type, in which these miRNA are enriched. Currently, the best technique for such a study is in situ hybridization (ISH). Such information, as currently available for various miRNA, has been included in Tables 1 and 2. For example, information on pancreatic \u03b2-cells-enriched miRNA is included in addition to pancreas-enriched miRNA, as well as enrichment of some miRNA in neurons located in various brain areas.",
                        "Several levels or generations of UST are possible. The first one can be developed for the systems of the human body (gastrointestinal, genitourinary, brain, cardiovascular, etc.). Next level of testing can focus on organs, tissues, cell types, and so on. Depending on clinical demands and economic advantages, there are at least two possible versions of UST and their practical applications: (i) first, the UST for human body systems can be performed and then, if a pathology in one or several systems has been detected, tests for organs/tissues of those systems will be performed; (ii) second, organ/tissue/cell type UST can be directly applied for screening purposes.",
                        "All organs and tissues consist of several cell types with different origin, function, and potential pathologies. Although the present invention is mainly focused on the level of organs and tissues, and their systems, the same approach can be used for developing UST covering various cell types, when sufficient information on miRNA expression profiles in various cell types becomes available. Currently, such information has been obtained for pancreatic \u03b2-cells (Tables 1 and 2), which makes it feasible to include the \u03b2-cell-enriched miRNA in UST, for example, for early detection of type 1 diabetes. miRNA markers for B- and T-lymphocyte are also available and their inclusion into UST will be helpful for early detection of pathologies that involve these cell types.",
                        "Although the present invention is focused on the UST development and its use for early detection of pathologies independent on their nature but specific to a particular organ system, organ, tissue, and/or cell type, such a test(s) can also include miRNA biomarkers, whose expression increase is characteristic of most common general pathologies, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and cancer (Table 3). Many more potential miRNA biomarkers for these pathologies are expected to be described soon.",
                        "Various useful miRNA biomarkers and normalizers described in the Examples, below, can be summarized in the following Tables:",
                        "Examples of useful methods for measuring miRNA level in bodily fluids include hybridization with selective probes (e.g., using Northern blotting, bead-based flow-cytometry, oligonucleotide microchip [microarray], or solution hybridization assays such as Ambion mirVana mirna Detection Kit), polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-based detection (e.g., stem-loop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR], quantitative RT-PCR based array method [qPCR-array]), or direct sequencing by one of the next generation sequencing technologies (e.g., Helicos small RNA sequencing, miRNA BeadArray (Illumina), Roche 454 (FLX-Titanium), and ABI SOLiD). For review of additional applicable techniques see, e.g., Chen et al., BMC Genomics, 2009, 10:407; Kong et al., J Cell Physiol. 2009; 218:22-25. Because many tissue/organ-specific miRNA are present in bodily fluids in much lower concentrations than ubiquitous miRNA, and a screening test should be capable of detecting early disease-associated changes, which can be relatively low, it is important to use, at least at the proof-of-principle stage, the most sensitive and minimally variable technique for measuring miRNA levels. In the present invention RT-PCR, which detects larger numbers of plasma miRNA and is significantly more robust than various array techniques, was used throughout the study. This does not exclude use of other techniques of miRNA analysis in a resulting clinical test.",
                        "In some embodiments, miRNA are purified prior to quantification. miRNA can be isolated and purified from bodily fluids by various methods, including the use of commercial kits (e.g., miRNeasy kit [Qiagen], MirVana RNA isolation kit [Ambion/ABI], miRACLE [Agilent], High Pure miRNA isolation kit [Roche], and miRNA Purification kit [Norgen Biotek Corp.]), Trizol extraction(see Example 1, below), concentration and purification on anion-exchangers, magnetic beads covered by RNA-binding substances, or adsorption of certain miRNA on complementary oligonucleotides.",
                        "In some embodiments, miRNA degradation in bodily fluid samples and/or during small RNA purification is reduced or eliminated. Useful methods for reducing or eliminating miRNA degradation include, without limitation, adding RNase inhibitors (e.g., RNasin Plus [Promega], SUPERase-In [ABI], etc.), use of guanidine chloride, guanidine isothiocyanate, N-lauroylsarcosine, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), or a combination thereof. Also, when working with urine samples, lower risk of miRNA degradation can be achieved when the sample has been held in the bladder for a shorter time (e.g., less than 4 hours). Reducing miRNA degradation in bodily fluid samples is particularly important when sample storage and transportation is required prior to miRNA quantification.",
                        "The present invention also provides several approaches for normalization of miRNA concentrations detected in bodily fluids. To account for possible losses of a given miRNA during purification, potential RT-PCR inhibition, miRNA contaminants derived from dying or damaged blood or urine cells during sample isolation and treatment, variations in kidney filtration, etc., various methods of experimental data normalization can be employed. For example, one or more of the following normalization methods can be used in the present invention:\n\n\n- - a) Synthetic miRNA (e.g., miRNA absent in human cells)\n    oligonucleotides can be synthesized and used as controls for losses\n    during purification and RT-PCR inhibition (by adding those to bodily\n    fluid samples before miRNA purification).\n  - b) Concentration of a target miRNA can be normalized to one of\n    ubiquitous miRNA (e.g., miR-16, miR-30e, miR-103 and others), small\n    nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), U6 small nuclear RNA (U6 RNA).\n  - c) Another approach is based on normalization of target miRNA\n    concentrations to miRNA that is expressed in numerous tissues but\n    not in a target one. For example miR-10a and miR-141 are expressed\n    in the brain at much lower level than in other organs, and\n    miR-409-3p is expressed in the lung at much lower level than in\n    other tissues. This approach decreases chances a normalizer miRNA\n    being changed due to a target pathology.\n  - d) Concentration of a target miRNA can also be normalized to miRNA\n    in other organ(s) (e.g. miRNA enriched in heart can be normalized to\n    miRNA enriched in colon or brain and vice versa).\n  - e) Normalization of a target miRNA per other miRNA enriched in the\n    same organ, tissue, or organ system can be effective if biomarker\n    and normalizer miRNA are expressed in different cell types or\n    different organs of the same system.\n  - f) Normalization of a target miRNA per another miRNA from the same\n    organ and tissue if their expression and/or secretion are effected\n    differently by a pathology.\n  - g) Normalization of a target miRNA per a tissue-enriched miRNA is\n    useful when, for example, changes in the expression and/or secretion\n    of a target miRNA are characteristic of a particular pathology\n    (cancer, inflammation, etc.) but the miRNA is not enriched in the\n    organ/tissue of interest. In such case normalization per a\n    tissue-enriched miRNA will be helpful for connecting a pathology to\n    a particular organ or organ system.\n  - h) Normalization per the average of several miRNA normalizers or, if\n    many, e.g. \\>15, miRNA are analyzed normalization per the average of\n    all miRNA tested.\n  - i) To account for variations in kidney filtration (when working with\n    urine samples), miRNA concentration in urine can be normalized on\n    creatinine and/or albumin level.",

                        "Early detection of Mild Cognitive Imparment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) was used for validating the proposed approach to the development of a screening test for the nervous system. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which comprise a large group of pathologies caused by metabolic changes in brain cells, loss of synapses and other compartments of neurons, and finally neuronal death (for review see Neurodegenerative diseases: From Molecular Concepts to Therapeutic Targets. Editors: R. von Bernhardi, N. C. Inestrosa, Nova Publishers, 2008). AD is characterized by neurite retraction, axonal transport defects, synaptic dysfunction, synaptic loss, and finally by neuronal death in several disease-specific areas of the brain, such as hippocampus and cortex (See, e.g., Crews, Masliah, Human Mol Gen., 2010, 19:R12-R20; Bredesen, Molecular Neurodegeneration 2009, 4:27; Nimmrich and Ebert, Rev Neurosci. 2009, 20:1-12; Yoshiyama et al., Neuron. 2007, 53:337-351; Wishart et al., J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2006, 65:733-739; Gylys et al., Neurochem Int. 2004; 44:125-131; Conforti et al., Trends Neurosci. 2007, 30:159-166; Revuelta, et al. Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen 2008, 23: 97-102).",
                        "The first symptomatic stage of AD that is manifested by mild clinical symptoms is MCI, which is usually defined as an intermediate state between normal aging and dementia (DeCarli, Lancet Neurol., 2003, 2:15-21; Stephan et al., Alzheimer's Res Therapy, 2009, 1:1-9; Apostolova et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2010, 31:786-797). MCI is a heterogeneous syndrome that may lead to different outcomes. Up to 40% of MCI patients revert to normal status (Larrieu et al., Neurology, 2002, 59:1594-1599; Brooks, Loewenstein, Alzheimer's Res Therapy, 2010, 2:28-36), and autopsy studies demonstrate that a substantial percentage of MCI patients do not have evidence of AD pathology (Jicha et al., Arch Neurol, 2006, 63:674-681; Khan, Alkon, Neurobiol. Aging, 2010, 31:889-900). About 60% of MCI patients convert to dementia at a rate of 10-15% annually (Petersen et al., Arch Neurol. 2001, 58:1985-1992; Apostolova et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2010, 31:786-797). Although AD is the most common cause of dementia, about 20% of MCI patients who progress to dementia are diagnosed not with AD but other neurodegenerative diseases, such as vascular, Lewy body, Huntington, Parkinson, and other dementias (Jicha et al., Arch Neurol, 2006, 63:674-681; Stephan et al., Alzheimer's Res Therapy, 2009, 1:1-9).",
                        "Thus, detection of MCI and AD by analysis of circulating miRNA supports the idea of developing an organ/system-specific test for various pathologies. As discussed in detail in the Examples for selection of biomarker and normalizer miRNA, concentrations of many brain-enriched miRNA, including neurite/synapse-enriched ones, in plasma of MCI and AD patients and age-matched control group were analyzed by RT-PCR. All selected miRNA were tested as potential biomarkers and normalizers and combinations, which provided statistically significant differentiation between MCI patients and age-matched controls, were identified as most promising. The data have demonstrated that the most effective potential biomarkers are neurite/synapse miRNA and the most effective normalizers are other brain-enriched miRNA, although other miRNA can also be used for normalization. Two families of biomarkers, miR-132 family and miR-134 family, and several normalizers have demonstrated the highest sensitivity (84%-92%) and specificity (84%-90%) in MCI detection. High correlation between members of miR-134 family can be easily explained by the fact that all members of this family, namely miR-134, miR-323-3p and miR-382, belong to the same cluster and are expressed in the same cell types. Close relationships between members of miR-132 family, namely miR-128, miR-132 and miR-874, have not been described before. It is also interesting that miR-132 and miR-134 biomarker families yield better results with different normalizers. miR-132 family works better than miR-134 family with normalizers miR-491-5p, miR-181a, miR-9, and miR-141. On the other hand, miR-134 family demonstrates better results than miR-132 family with normalizers miR-370 and miR-127.",
                        "Thus, the heterogeneous MCI syndrome and AD can be detected by analysis of cell-free circulating brain-enriched miRNA in the plasma.",
                        "Since different brain areas are involved in various neurodegenerative diseases leading to the development of dementia (Geldmacher & Whitehouse, Neurology. 1997, 48:S2-9; Levy & Chelune, J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol. 2007 20:227-238; Gong & Lippa, Am J Alzheimer's Dis Other Demen, 2010, 25:547-555) and due to diverse miRNA expression profile in various brain areas (Landgraf et al., Cell. 2007, 129:1401-1414; The miR-Ontology Data Base: http://ferrolab.dmi.unict.it/miro/), analysis of other brain-enriched miRNA would be helpful for distinguishing changes and processes caused by distinct neuronal pathologies in the brain.",
                        "Gastrointestinal System",
                        "Plasma samples of patients with stages 1 and 2 cancers of three gastrointestinal (GI) organs (esophagus. stomach, and colon) and with the Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the GI tract) were used for validating the proposed approach to the development of a screening test for the GI system. Plasma concentrations of miRNA enriched in GI system or in particular GI organs, e.g. miR-215 highly enriched in colon and small intestine and miR-203, enriched in esophagus and to a lesser degree in stomach, as well as of ubiquitous miR-30e-3p were measured. Ratios of all possible miRNA pairs were calculated to find the most promising biomarker/normalizer combinations. The obtained data have demonstrated that miR-192, miR-194, miR-203 and miR-215 are the most effective biomarkers, and miR-145, miR-148a and miR-30e-3p are the most effective normalizers. Biomarker/normalizer ratios effectively differentiate patients with all studied diseases from controls. miR-203, highly enriched in esophagus and stomach, is especially effective in detecting cancers of these organs, and miR-215, highly enriched in column is most effective in differentiating patients with colon cancer and Crohn's disease from controls. Combination of two or more biomarker/normalizer ratios can be used to increase specificity and sensitivity. For example, miR-192 and miR-203 normalized per miR-30e-3p effectively distinguished patients with all pathologies of GI system from controls with 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity. It is important that all tested tumors were stage 1 or 2, which means that the proposed approach can be effectively used for screening and early diagnosis. Then pairs of different cancers as well as Crohn's disease versus all cancers of the GI system were compared in greater details. As a result the following biomarker/normalizer ratios capable of distinguishing particular pathologies have been found:\n\n\n- - 1. Crohn's disease versus esophageal, gastric and colorectal\n    cancers: miR-194/miR-148; miR-215/miR-30e-3p; miR-215/miR-194;\n    miR-203/miR-148a; miR-192/miR-203; miR-215/miR-203 and\n    miR-194/miR-192.\n  - 2. Esophageal cancer versus gastric cancer: miR-194/miR-145;\n    miR194/miR-148a; miR194/miR-30e-3p.\n  - 3. Esophageal cancer versus colorectal cancer: miR-192/miR-145;\n    miR192/miR-148a; miR192/miR-30e-3p.\n  - 4. Gastric cancer versus colorectal cancer: miR-203/30e-3p;\n    miR-203/miR-148a; miR-215/miR-203.\n  - Thus, analysis of plasma concentrations of miRNA enriched in organs\n    of the GI system is effective for: (i) detection of tumors and\n    inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease, in esophagus,\n    stomach and colon; (ii) differentiation of an inflammatory disease\n    from cancers; (iii) differentiation of cancers located in various\n    organs of the GI system.",

Since enrolled patients with asthma and pneumonia were non-smokers and patients with COPD and NSCLC were smokers, plasma samples were also collected from two distinct control groups\u2014smokers and non-smokers. Plasma concentrations of lung-enriched miRNA and of miR-409-3p, which is present in many organs but is under-expressed in the lung, were measured. Again, as described above for the GI system, ratios of all possible miRNA pairs were calculated to find the most promising biomarker/normalizer combinations.",
                        "miR-34b and miR-486-5p, which are highly enriched in the lung, have been found to be effective biomarkers that normalized per miR-409-3p differentiated patients with asthma and pneumonia from non-smoking controls and patients with COPD and NSCLC from smoking controls. Other effective normalizers are lung-enriched miR-142-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-155 and miR-223, potentially due to their downregulation in lung pathologies (Liu X. et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009, 15:1177-1183; Miko E. et al., Exp. Lung Res. 2009, 35:646-664; Halappanavar S. et al. Toxicology 2011, 285: 133-141; Heegaard N H et al. Int. J. Cancer, 2012, 130:1378-1386). Unexpectedly, miR-192 also behaved as an effective biomarker for pulmonary pathologies. Since this miRNA was also shown to be an effective biomarker for diseases of the GI system, it is reasonable to suggest that expression or/and secretion of miR-192 is increased due to inflammation or tumor development processes (Benjamin H. et al., J. Mol. Diagn. 2010, 12:771-779; Lan H Y. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2011 Dec. 28 [Epub ahead of print]; Luzna P. et al. Diagn. Pathol. 2011, 6:114; Wu Q. et al. J. Biomed.

As described in details in Examples, miRNA were purified from the plasma samples obtained from patients with diseases of the GI system (Crohn's disease and esophageal, gastric and colorectal cancers) and of the pulmonary system (asthma, pneumonia, COPD and NSCLC). Concentrations of lung-enriched and GI system-enriched miRNA as well as, several miRNA, involved in pathological processes of various organs, were analyzed. Additionally, ubiquitous miR-30e-3p and miR-409-3p were included in the study as potential normalizers. Concentrations of each miRNA were normalized per miR-30e-3p and miR-409-3p, as well as on each other, converted into Relative Quantity (RQ) of miRNA according the ABI protocol (2\u2212\u0394Ct), and miRNA profiles characteristic of patients with the diseases of pulmonary and GI systems were compared. The data demonstrated that many miRNA pairs effectively distinguish patients with diseases of pulmonary and GI systems: miR-192/miR-126; miR-155/miR-126; miR-145/miR-126; miR-155/miR-30e-3p; miR-192/miR-30e-3p; miR-155/miR-409-3p; miR-486-5p/miR-17-5p; miR-155/miR-17-5p; miR-192/miR-17-5p; miR-146b-5p/miR-31; miR-155/miR-31; miR-192/miR-31; miR-486-5p/miR-155; miR-192/miR-155; miR-145/miR-155; miR-146b-5p/miR-155; 486-5p/miR-203; miR-192/miR-203; miR-145/miR-203; miR-192/miR-215; miR-155/miR-215. Combination of two miRNA pairs increases the test accuracy. For example, the combination of miR-145/miR-155 and miR-486-5p/miR-155 ratios distinguished patients with all pathologies of the GI system from patients with pulmonary diseases with 95% sensitivity, 90% specificity, and 93% accuracy.",
                        "Distinction of Different Pathologies in Various organ Systems",
                        "Due to characteristic changes in expression and secretion of some miRNA during inflammatory diseases and cancer development in various organs, it was hypothesized that analysis of their concentrations in bodily fluids could be used for distinguishing among these pathologies. The same plasma samples were used for miRNA purification and the same miRNA that were described in the previous section were analyzed. In this study the ability of various miRNA combinations to differentiate patients with inflammatory diseases (asthma, pneumonia, COPD and Crohn's disease) from patients with various cancers (esophageal, gastric, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers) was investigated. The data demonstrate that several miRNA pairs effectively distinguish patients with inflammatory diseases from cancer patients: miR-17-5p/miR-155; mir-192/miR-155; miR-215/miR-155; miR146b-5p/miR155; miR192/miR-30e; miR-146b-5p/miR-30e-3p; miR155/miR-30e-3p. There are less miRNA pairs that differentiate inflammation diseases from cancers than miRNA pairs capable to differentiate diseases of the pulmonary system from diseases of GI system. First, changes in expression of many miRNA are characteristic to both pathology types. Second, in many cases carcinogenesis is accompanied by relatively prominent inflammation. Combination of two miRNA pairs increases the test accuracy. For example the combination of miR-146b-5p/miR-155 and miR-146b-5p/miR-30e-3p ratios distinguished all patients with inflammatory diseases from cancer patients with 80% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 89% accuracy.",
                        "Thus, the results of the experiments presented in present invention support its main ideas. The analysis of plasma concentration of miRNA, enriched in a particular organ system or in an organ, differentiates: (i) organ system diseases from controls; (ii) pathologies of three organs of the gastrointestinal system; (iii) diseases of pulmonary and gastrointestinal system; (iv) cancers and inflammatory diseases.",

In addition, the in-house techniques based on the use of Trizol (Invitrogen) are commonly used. After Trizol deproteinization, RNA is precipitated with isopropyl alcohol or additionally purified on silica columns. In some experiments, purified RNA is treated with RNAse-free DNAse (Qiagen, ABI, Invitrogen or other). miRNA preparations obtained by different methods are compared using RT PCR.",

Two techniques, one based on MirVana Paris kit (Ambion/ABI), and another based on Trizol (Invitrogen) deproteinization, and subsequent purification on silica columns, were compared. After RNA purification, concentrations of spiked miRNA and human endogenous miR-9, miR-16, and miR-134 were measured in final preps by RT-PCR. MirVana Paris kit was more effective in miRNA isolation then the Trizol-based technique and was selected for future experiments. Although all analyzed miRNA were detectable in serum and plasma and both sample types are suitable for miRNA testing, the final PCR Ct values were about 2 cycles lower for plasma, and the latter was used in subsequent experiments. Based on the quantitative measurement of spiked ath-miR-159a, average yield of miRNA isolated from plasma with MirVana kit was 71.4%.",

Then miRNA common for several organs of the same organ system were selected as potential biomarkers for the respective system (Table 2, column 2). Those miRNA that are enriched in one organ but not in other organs of the system were identified as potential biomarkers for more precise pathology localization (Table 2, column 3). For normalization, in addition to spiked synthetic non-human miRNA, e.g., ath-mir-159a, and ubiquitous miRNA, such as miR-16 and miR-30e-3p, miRNA expressed in numerous tissues but not in a target tissue were selected. For example, miR-10b and miR-141 can be used for normalizing brain biomarkers, and miR-409-3p for pulmonary system biomarkers, etc. Other promising normalizers, which are enriched in the analyzed tissues, organs and systems analyzed, were selected experimentally.",

                                "Two families of biomarkers, miR-132 and miR-134 families, and several normalizers have demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity. Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for these combinations of biomarkers and a normalizer are presented in FIGS. 7A-C and 8A-C. Biomarkers miR-128, miR-132 and mir-874 (\u201cmiR-132 family\u201d) demonstrated 84%-92% sensitivity and 84%-90% specificity when normalized per miR-491-5p.

The second promising set of biomarkers consists of miR-134, miR-323-3p and miR-382 (\u201cmiR-134 family\u201d) and demonstrates 78%-91% sensitivity and 85-87% specificity when normalized per miR-370. AUC for miR-134, miR-323-3p and miR-382 are 091, 0.94 and 0.92, respectively.",
                                "Correlation analysis shown in FIG. 9A-F demonstrates that miR-128, miR-132 and miR-874 form one family of biomarkers (Spearman test r values in the pair comparison are in the 0.93-0.95 range) and miR-134, miR-323-p and miR-382 form another family of biomarkers (Spearman test r values in the pair comparison are in the 0.87-0.93 range). High correlation between members of miR-134 family can be easily explained by the fact that all members of this family, namely miR-134, miR-323-3p and miR-382, belong to the same cluster and are expressed in the same cell types (http://www.diana.pcbi.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/miRGen/v3/Cluster.cgi). Close relationships between members of miR-132 family, namely miR-128, miR-132 and miR-874, have not been described before. It is also interesting that biomarker families miR-132 and miR-134 produce better results with different normalizers. miR-132 family works better than miR-134 family with normalizers miR-491-5p, miR-181a, miR-9, and miR-141. On the other hand, miR-134 family demonstrates better results than miR-132 family with normalizers miR-370 and miR-127. Correlation between miR-132 and miR-134 biomarker families is relatively low (r values in the pair comparison Spearman test are in the 0.56-0.79 range) indicating that they either reflect distinct pathological processes or are located in different brain areas.",

                                "Plasma samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with various lung diseases, such as asthma, pneumonia, Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 in each group. Since enrolled patients with asthma and pneumonia were non-smokers and patients with COPD and NSCLC were smokers, plasma samples were also collected from two groups of controls, smokers and non-smokers, 10 in each group. RNA was isolated from two 200 \u03bcl aliquots of plasma samples by the Trizol-silica method according to an Asuragen procedure. Single target qRT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan\u00ae Reverse Transcription Kit and miRNA-specific stem-loop primers (Applied Biosystems).

The latter is essentially ubiquitous but under-expressed in the lung. Concentrations of each lung-enriched miRNA were normalized per miR-409-3p and miR-192, as well as on each other, converted into Relative Quantity (RQ) of miRNA according the ABI protocol (2\u2212\u0394Ct), and compared with miRNA profiles from controls.",
                                "As expected miR-34b and miR-486-5p, which are highly enriched in the lung, were found to be effective biomarkers and miR-409-3p is an effective normalizer (FIG. 10A-D). Other effective normalizers are lung-enriched miR-142-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-155 and miR-223 (FIGS. 11A-H and 12A-H), which, at least in some cases, could be explained by their downregulation in lung pathologies (Liu X. et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009, 15:1177-1183; Miko E. et al., Exp. Lung Res. 2009, 35:646-664; Halappanavar S. et al. Toxicology 2011, 285: 133-141; Heegaard N H et al. Int. J. Cancer, 2012, 130:1378-1386). Unexpectedly, miR-192 also behaved as an effective biomarker (FIG. 13A-J). Since this miRNA was also shown to be a biomarker for diseases of the GI system, it is reasonable to suggest that expression and/or secretion of this miRNA is increased due to inflammation or tumor development (Benjamin H. et al., J. Mol. Diagn. 2010, 12:771-779; Lan H Y. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2011 Dec. 28 [Epub ahead of print]; Luzna P. et al. Diagn. Pathol. 2011, 6:114; Wu Q. et al. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2011, Epub May 26; Zhou J. et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 2011, 29:4781-4788).\n\nmiRNA biomarker miRNA/miRNA normalizer ratios were not different for smoking and non-smoking controls. Thus, various pathologies could be compared to the combined controls (smoking and non-smoking subjects). FIG. 14A-C demonstrates that the four analyzed pathologies are effectively distinguished from such combined controls by various sets of miRNA biomarkers and normalizers, e.g. miR-34b normalized per miR-409-3p, miR-486-5p normalized per miR-223, or miR-192 normalized per miR-155. There were also other effective sets of miRNA biomarkers and normalizers.\n\nThe ability of various combinations of miRNA biomarkers and normalizers to distinguish NSCLC from such inflammatory diseases as asthma, pneumonia and COPD was also analyzed. FIG. 15A-C shows that patients with NSCLC are differentiated from patients with inflammatory diseases using ratios of miR-34b to miR-155, miR-486-5p to miR-146b-5p or miR-192 to miR-146b-5p. There were other effective combinations of miRNA biomarkers and normalizers.",

FIG. 16A-L clearly shows miR-192, miR-194, miR-203 and miR-215 as effective biomarkers, and miR-145, miR-148a and miR-30e-3p as effective normalizers. Biomarker/normalizer ratios effectively differentiate patients with all studied diseases from controls. miR-203, highly enriched in esophagus and stomach, is especially effective in detecting cancers of these organs, and miR-215, highly enriched in column is most effective in differentiating patients with colon cancer and Crohn's disease from controls. Combination of miR-192 and miR-203 normalized per miR-30e-3p effectively distinguishes patients with all pathologies of the GI system from controls (FIG. 16M) with 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity calculated as described in Example 8. It is important that all tumors were stage 1 or 2 cancers, which means that the proposed approach can be effectively used for screening and early diagnosis.",
