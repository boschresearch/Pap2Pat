    "abstract": "A process for the linear synthesis of a gram-positive class II bacteriocin or a variant thereof is disclosed herein. The process comprises the stepwise addition of selected amino acids to a solid support; pseudoproline positioning and reopening; and cleavage of the gram-positive class II bacteriocin or the variant thereof from the solid support to provide a linear gram-positive class II bacteriocin or variant thereof; and in situ disulfide bond formation. Various applications and uses of the synthetic bacteriocins are also disclosed. The synthetic process can also be used to synthesize variants of bacteriocins by the selective substitution of one or more amino acids and/or additions and/or deletions of selected amino acids.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Antibiotic therapy is certainly one of the most important scientific achievements of the twentieth century both in terms of economic and health impacts for animals as well as for humans. However, the abuse of antibiotics, such as by overprescription, has led to an alarming increase in the number of multi-resistant pathogenic strains such as MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), VRE (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci) and Clostridium difficile and the appearance of serious health problems including significant damage to human commensal microflora and certain autoimmune diseases.[1]",
                        "The increase in resistance to antibiotics has become a major challenge in the treatment of various bacterial infections. Indeed, the use of large-scale antibiotics has accelerated the emergence of resistance in many bacterial species. In the US alone, according to recent reports by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are at least 2 million people suffering from bacterial related infections, and 23000 deaths per year have been reported that are linked to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In view of the first generations of antibiotics losing their effectiveness, as evidenced by the aforementioned resistance, a substantial amount of research is being dedicated to the discovery and development of novel and alternative antibiotics.",
                        "Bacteriocins represent a class of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by a broad variety of bacteria in order to survive in their respective competitive environments. Potential health risks associated with the use of chemical preservatives, in addition to increased consumer awareness, have led to bacteriocins being given greater consideration as natural antimicrobial agents.[2] The substantial absence of cross-resistance, as well as the faint propensity for the development of resistance, are further factors favoring the use of bacteriocins as antibiotic agents.[3, 4] Moreover, several combinations of bacteriocins and antibiotics have been reported as exhibiting synergistic effects.[5] Furthermore, bacteriocins have been considered for use in both medicine and the food industry. To date, only one bacteriocin (i.e. nisin A; commercialised as Nisaplin\u00ae) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as \u201cGenerally Recognized As Safe\u201d (GRAS). The market value of nisin is expected to reach 500 M$ in 2020.",
                        "Among the bacteriocins, the class IIa bacteriocins are produced from food grade bacteria, which offer food scientists the possibility of directing or preventing the development of specific bacterial species in food. This can be particularly useful in preservation or food safety applications. Indeed, the class IIa bacteriocins are active against pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes which has a mortality rate as high as 20-30% when infected. Moreover, Listeria monocytogenes has been associated with neonatal deaths, fetal demise, severe meningitis and sepsis.",
                        "Even though a great many bacteriocins have been sequenced, only very few have actually been chemically synthesized. Indeed, their synthesis represents, and continuous to represent, a significant challenge to the peptide chemist, largely due to their inherent structural complexity and well defined structure activity relationships (SAR).[6] Moreover, purified bacteriocins isolated from fermentation batches remain quite expensive, partly due to a lengthy purification process, prohibiting their commercial-scale exploitation.[7] The development of chemical syntheses provides for the added advantage of enhancing the pharmacological properties of a given bacteriocin (e.g. solubility, stability, potency, activity and bioavailability). Among the class IIa bacteriocins, only a very few called \u201cpediocin-like\u201d bacteriocins, have actually been successfully synthesized. Similarly, very few class IIb-e bacteriocins have been successfully synthesized. To that effect, the total synthesis of Pediocin PA-1 and bactofencin A has been previously achieved in extremely low yields (\u02dc0.1% overall yield) and only a few analogs have been prepared. Pediocin PA-1 (class IIa bacteriocin) is a broad-spectrum lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin that shows a particularly strong activity against Listeria monocytogenes. Bactofencin A (class IId bacteriocin), shows strong activity against pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.",

All process/method steps described herein are to be conducted under conditions sufficient to provide the product (e.g. peptide) shown. A person skilled in the art would understand that all process/method conditions, including, for example, process/method solvent, process/method time, process/method temperature, process/method pressure, reagent/ingredient ratio and whether or not the process/method should be performed under an anhydrous or inert atmosphere, can be varied to optimize the yield of the desired product and it is within their skill to do so.",

Conversion may be maximized when greater than about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 99% of the starting material or substrate is converted to product.",
                                "The term \u201canalogue\u201d as used herein with reference to the antibacterial peptides refers to a peptide in which one or more individual atoms or functional groups or amino acid residues have been replaced, either with a different atom or a different functional group or a different amino acid residue.",
                                "The term \u201cchemical modification\u201d refers to a change in the naturally-occurring chemical structure of one or more amino acids of a polypeptide. Such modifications can be made to a side chain or a terminus, e.g., changing the amino-terminus or carboxyl terminus. In some embodiments, the modifications are useful for creating chemical groups that can conveniently be used to link the polypeptides to other materials.",
                                "The term \u201camino acid\u201d as used herein refers to an organic acid containing both a basic amino group and an acidic carboxyl group. Therefore, the molecule is amphoteric and exists in aqueous solution as dipole ions. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the amino acids are the L-amino acids. They include but are not limited to the 25 amino acids that have been established as protein constituents. They must contain at least one carboxyl group and one primary or secondary amino group on the amino acid molecule. They include such proteinogenic amino acids as alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, proline, hydroxyproline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, hydroxylysine, ornithine, arginine, histidine, penicillamine and the like. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the amino acids are the D-amino acids. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the amino acids are a mixture of the L- and the D-amino acids.",
                                "The term \u201cresin linker\u201d as used herein refers to a molecule attached to the solid support for connecting the peptide chain to the solid support. Linker molecules are generally designed such that eventual cleavage provides either a free acid or amide at the C-terminus. Linkers are generally not resin-specific. The first amino acid of the peptide sequence may be attached to the linker after the linker is attached to the solid support or attached to the solid support using a linker that includes the first amino acid of the peptide sequence.",
                                "Conservative changes can generally be made to an amino acid sequence without altering activity. These changes are termed \u201cconservative substitutions\u201d; that is, an amino acid belonging to a grouping of amino acids having a particular size or characteristic can be substituted for another amino acid. Substitutes for an amino acid sequence can be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, and tyrosine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Such substitutions are not expected to substantially affect apparent molecular weight as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or isoelectric point. Conservative substitutions also include substituting optical isomers of the sequences for other optical isomers, specifically d amino acids for l amino acids for one or more residues of a sequence. Moreover, all of the amino acids in a sequence can undergo a d to l isomer substitution. Exemplary conservative substitutions include, but are not limited to, Lys for Arg and vice versa to maintain a positive charge; Glu for Asp and vice versa to maintain a negative charge; Ser for Thr so that a free \u2014OH is maintained; and Gln for Asn to maintain a free \u2014NH2. Yet another type of conservative substitution constitutes the case where amino acids with desired chemical reactivities are introduced to impart reactive sites for chemical conjugation reactions, if the need for chemical derivatization arises. Such amino acids include but are not limited to Cys (to insert a sulfhydryl group), Lys (to insert a primary amine), Asp and Glu (to insert a carboxylic acid group). Moreover, substitutions, deletions and insertions of the polypeptide sequences can in some cases be made without a loss of function of the polypeptide.

The HMPB-ChemMatrix\u00ae solid support was selected to perform the synthesis in view of its higher performance with larger peptides and/or its ability to form aggregation-disrupting interactions with the growing peptide chains. An initial attempt at preparing the linear precursor 1 by stepwise amino acid additions yielded a complex mixture of short peptides while the desired peptide product could not be observed. In order to identify the problematic amino acid couplings, a series of C-terminal ladder sequences starting from Gly40 and working upstream (GNHKC, QGNHKC, etc.) were prepared in parallel and analyzed by HPLC-MS after their cleavage from the resin. The results showed that the coupling of Fmoc-Ala-OH on Gly29 was ineffective. As reported in a previous study on pediocin analogs, pseudoprolines were incorporated to address these problematic couplings by coupling Fmoc-Val-Thr(\u03a8Me,Mepro)-OH on residue Cys9, and Fmoc-Ala-Thr(\u03a8Me,Mepro)-OH on residues Thr23 and Gly36.[8]. The combined use of the HMPB linker and the ChemMatrix solid support (resin), as well as the positioning of the aforementioned pseudoprolines, provides for the preparation and isolation of linear pediocin PA-1 1 following side-chain deprotection and cleavage from the resin. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, peptide cleavage from the resin is achieved by exposing the resin-bound peptides to a TFA cocktail over a period of time sufficient to yield the crude peptide.

This observation was corroborated by further HPLC analysis showing only a single signal that was attributed to the desired linear pediocin PA-1 1 (55-70% overall yield).",

                                "Formation of selective disulfide linkages under mild oxidative conditions generated PA-1 3. Disulfide bond formation however proved to be a challenge in view of the Met31 being very sensitive to oxidation. It was observed that PA-1 2, comprising disulfide linkages between Cys9-Cys24 and Cys14-Cys44 (2a), between Cys9-Cys44 and Cys14-Cys24 (2b), and between Cys9-Cys14 and Cys24-Cys24 (2c), showed no activity. This lack of activity is attributed to the presence of the oxidized Met31 residue. To address the problem associated with the concomitant oxidation of the Met31 residue, it was fortuitously discovered the desired PA-1 3 could be obtained by simultaneous disulfide bond formation and Met31 oxidation using N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS), followed by selective reduction of the Met31 residue using TBAB/TFA/HSCH2CH2OH/Anisole.",
                                "Initial attempts at the formation of PA-1 2 from linear precursor PA-1 1 using NCS, resulted in a great number of side products as observed by HPLC. Further analysis of the associated MS and MS/MS spectra revealed that most of the side products comprise peptides having chlorinated aromatic side chains. The presence of such peptide side-products was attributed to the presence of residual TFA counter ions in the purified linear precursor PA-1 1. Such TFA counter ions have been previously reported as catalysts for the chlorination of aromatic residues using NCS. Further purification of the linear precursor PA-1 1 by HPLC, using acetic acid in the mobile phase, resulted in the substantially complete removal of any TFA counter ions from the linear precursor PA-1 1. Indeed, when PA-1 1 was subjected to simultaneous disulfide bond formation and Met31 oxidation using N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS), no chlorinated adducts could be observed. PA-1 2 was obtained as a mixture of 2a (7.5%), 2b (21.5%) and 2c (71.0%) (as determined by HPLC) (FIG. 2A). Subsequent purification by HPLC and MS/MS analysis of the three isolated peptides, provided for the identification of the third peak as that of the oxidized native pediocin PA-1 2c.[10] Reduction of the oxidized Met31 residue at room temperature using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) in TFA, in the presence of mercaptoethanol (HSCH2CH2OH) and anisole, yielded PA-1 3c. The reduction of the oxidized Met31 residue could be achieved without affecting any of the previously established disulfide bonds. Crude pediocin PA-1 3c was subsequently purified by precipitation in cold diethyl ether.",
                                "The presence of synthetic pediocin PA-1 3c was confirmed by HPLC-MS analysis (FIG. 2B) and MALDI-TOF MS (FIG. 2C). MALDI-TOF MS analysis corroborated the presence of synthetic pediocin PA-1 3c as per the observation of a molecular ion at 4625.2592 Da (calculated [M+H]+ for C196H294N61O60S5: 4625.1449 Da). The amino acid sequence of synthetic pediocin PA-1 3c was subsequently validated by MS/MS following disulfide bond reduction, cysteine S-alkylation using iodoacetamide and trypsin digestion. A similar synthetic process was applied for the synthesis of pediocin PA-1 3a and pediocin PA-1 3b from purified PA-1 2a and PA-1 2b respectively. Table 1 illustrates the peptides synthesized.",
                                "To avoid the oxidation of the Met31 residue during the synthesis, antibacterial assays and conformational studies, a linear analog of pediocin PA-1 (4) containing a Leu31 residue was prepared as described above. Following purification as described above, pediocin PA-1 4 was obtained in 40% overall yield. Pediocin PA-1 4 was subsequently submitted to disulfide bond formation using NCS to afford pediocin PA-1 and analogue 5 (PA-1 M31L). A reduction protocol was obviated in view of the peptide not containing a Met31 residue.",
                                "To demonstrate the importance of the disulfide bonds to the antimicrobial activity of pediocin PA-1 and to maintain its bioactive conformation, a further pediocin PA-1 analog (6) was prepared as described above. Relative to pediocin PA-1 3, pediocin PA-1 6 comprises alanine residues Ala9, Ala14, Ala24 and Ala44. In essence, the Cys residues in PA-1 3 were substituted for Ala residues in PA-1 6.",
                                "The antimicrobial activity of pediocin PA-1 1, 2a, 3a-c and pediocin analogues 4 and 6 was assessed by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration against Listeria ivanovii HPB28, Listeria monocytogenes LSD530, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 and Pediococcus acidilacti UL5. The observed respective minimal inhibitory concentrations are given in Table 2. Synthetic pediocin PA-1 3c showed strong activity with a low nanomolar MIC of 6.75 nM against L. ivanovii HPB28 and L. monocytogenes LSD530 respectively, and a nanomolar MIC of 13.5 nM against L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111. Compared to PA-1 3c, PA-1 3a and 3b, the latter two peptides having an incorrect disulfide bond pairing, showed a 2- to 4-fold decrease in activity against Listeria ivanovii HPB28, Listeria monocytogenes LSD530 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111 (MIC ranging from 13.5-27.0 nM). The enhanced antimicrobial activity of PA-1 3c relative to PA-1 3a and 3b, could at least in part be explained by PA-1 3c exhibiting an energetically more favorable conformation. Indeed, as per the observed mixture of 2a (7.5%), 2b (21.5%) and 2c (71.5%), there appears to be a thermodynamic equilibrium in the disulfide pairings favoring the conformation exhibited by PA-1 3c. As expected, a significant decrease of antimicrobial activity was observed for PA-1 2a comprising an oxidized Met31 residue. PA-1 2a exhibited an MIC of 1562 nM against Listeria ivanovii HPB28 and Listeria monocytogenes LSD530, and an MIC of 25000 nM against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111. These results confirm that the oxidation of the Met31 residue is detrimental to the activity of PA-1.",
                                "Surprisingly, linear pediocin PA-1 1 and linear analogue 4 showed similar antimicrobial activity in radial diffusion and microplate dilution assays. Interestingly, these results suggest that the disulfide bonds can be suitably formed in situ in the bioassay medium, without the help of chaperone-like proteins.[5] The observed increased antimicrobial activity of linear pediocin PA-1 1 relative to PA-1 3c, could at least in part be explained by the presence of the free Cys residues acting as oxidant scavengers, preventing the oxidation of the Met31 during disulfide bond formation. The observed antimicrobial activity for linear analog 4 is in agreement with the MIC values previously reported.[9] Regarding PA-1 3c, it is possible that a small amount of Met31 gets oxidized during the assay, thus decreasing its antimicrobial activity. No antimicrobial activity was observed for linear analog 6, indicative of the disulfide bonds being essential for the activity of pediocin PA-1. Even though antimicrobial activity of pediocin PA-1 against Micrococcus luteus has recently been reported[12], no activity against M. luteus ATCC 10240 could be observed for synthetic pediocin PA-1 3c, PA-1 3a, 3b and linear analogues 4 and 6 at up to 100 M. It is surmised that this could be the result of low agitation of the cells which need to be oxygenated or again fast methionine oxidation. Finally, none of the synthesized peptides showed antimicrobial activity against P. acidilacti UL5.",
                                "In order to confirm the results as obtained in the MIC assay, the antibacterial activity of the synthetized peptides was further assessed by radial diffusion assays against L. monocytogenes LSD530 and compared to native pediocin PA-1 produced by P. acidilacti UL5 (FIG. 3). In agar plate assays against L. monocytogenes LSD530, the presence of pediocin PA-1 in the supernatant of P. acidilacti UL5 was confirmed by the observed antimicrobial activity with an inhibition diameter of 24 mm (FIG. 3A-D). As expected, synthetic pediocin PA-1 3c showed a substantial inhibition diameter of 31 mm while poor and no activity was observed for analogs 2c and 6, respectively (FIG. 3A). As previously observed with the MIC assay, reduced activity was observed for PA-1 3a and PA-1 3b exhibiting inhibition diameters of 24 and 27 mm, respectively (FIG. 3B). Linear pediocin PA-1 1 and linear analogue 4 exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity as per the observed inhibition diameters of 32 mm (FIGS. 3C and 3D). These results again suggest in situ disulfide bond formation for PA-1 1 and linear analogue 4.[5] Finally, none of the synthetic peptides 2c, 3a-c, and 6 shows antimicrobial activity against P. acidilacti UL5 (FIG. 3F)",
                                "To corroborate the possibility of in situ disulfide bond formation, bactofencin A (BAC221) linear analogs 7 and 8 were prepared as described above and evaluated in the radial diffusion assay (FIG. 3E). Bactofencin A, a bacteriocin isolated from a porcine intestinal bacteria Lactobacillus salivarius DPC6502, and consisting of a short 22 residue, defensin-like sequence, including a disulfide bridge and a methionine residue, is known to be active against both L. monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.[11] Bactofencin A linear analogs 7 and 8 exhibited inhibition diameters of 9 and 11 mm, respectively against L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111. These results are in accordance with previously reported inhibition diameters for native bactofencin A against the aforementioned strains. These results again support in situ disulfide bond formation and further suggest that the Met residues mostly function as hydrophobic residues in the class II bacteriocin mechanism of action. Moreover, the Met18 residue of analogue 7 can be replaced with a Leu18 (analogue 8) enhancing the stability of the peptide.",
                                "Synthetic bactofencin A linear analogs 7 and 8 exhibited low micromolar MIC values of 5.8 \u03bcM and 2.8 \u03bcM against S. aureus ATCC 6538 and L. monocytogenes ATCC 19111, respectively (Table 3).",

                                "Circular dichroism experiments were performed (FIG. 5) in order to determine the optimal conditions for the 1H NMR spectroscopy studies of the peptides. A solvent mixture composed of trifluoroethanol (TFE-d2) and H2O (50/50) was used for the 1H NMR structure analyses. The pH of the solution was maintained under a value of 3 in order to maintain the disulfide bridges in the appropriate pairings. Moreover, Pediocin PA-1 M31L 5 was used in order to prevent oxidation and structural changes during the acquisition times. Moreover, leucine is well known to mimic the electrostatic surface of the methionine. One-dimensional 1H NMR and two-dimensional homonuclear 1H-1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) data sets were acquired. FIG. 6 illustrates the lowest relative energy structure (\u03b1-helix red, \u03b2-sheet yellow, loops green and disulfide bridge orange) for synthetic pediocin PA-1 analog 5 as determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy.",

It is to be understood that all process/method steps described herein are to be conducted under conditions sufficient to provide the desired end product (e.g. a gram-positive class IId bacteriocin). A person skilled in the art would understand that all processing conditions, including, for example, processing time, processing temperature, and whether or not the process should be performed under an anhydrous or inert atmosphere, can be varied to optimize the yield of the desired product and it is within their skill to do so.",
                                "It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, that in the course of peptide synthesis, it may be necessary to protect certain side chains of the amino acids to prevent unwanted side reactions. For example, it may be necessary to protect the hydroxyl group on the side chain of tyrosine, serine, or threonine in order to prevent these groups from interfering with the desired reactions. This is a common problem in peptide synthesis and many procedures are available for protecting the functional groups on the side chains of the amino acids. Such procedures for protecting various functional groups are known to one skilled in the art and are described in the treatise entitled \u201cPEPTIDES: CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY\u201d, Norbert Sewald and Hans-Dieter Jakubke, 2nd Edition, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co., Weinheim, 2009, and the reference book \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, by T.W.

                                "Leucine for methionine substitution resulted in variants having increased activity. Indeed, enhanced activity was observed for peptide 2 relative to peptide 1 (2.00 M versus 4.06 M respectively) against S. aureus. Substituting the HMPB linker for the Rink linker resulted in the isolation of peptides (following cleavage from the solid state resin) having an amidated C-terminal. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, bactofencin A-based variants were prepared comprising an acetylated N-terminal (e.g. peptide 4). Peptide 3 comprising an amidated C-terminal was shown to exhibit enhanced activity relative to peptides 1 and 2 respectively against S. aureus. However, peptide 4, comprising both an amidated C-terminal and an acetylated N-terminal, was shown to exhibit an activity against S. aureus similar to peptide 2. Substitution of the HMPB-ChemMatrix for the 2-TCP resin, resulted in higher yields of isolated peptides (25.8% to 62.6% respectively) following purification. Peptide 2, obtained by replacement of the methionine residues for leucine residues, was shown to exhibit better activity against both S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, suggesting that the methionine residues can be replaced in order to enhance the oxidative resistance of the peptide. Cysteine replacement resulted in 6.25% activity for peptide C7A and a complete loss of activity for peptide C22A. Various alanine substitutions, as for peptides K1A-C22A were also performed. The intramolecular disulfide bond seems to be essential for the activity. Indeed, substitution of the cysteine residues at positions 7 and 22 respectively resulted in an important loss of activity for C7A to complete inactivation for C22A respectively. The loss of activity observed for peptides wherein one or both of the cysteine residues have been substituted further emphasizes the importance of in situ disulfide bond formation in the activity of the peptides. Moreover, in situ disulfide bond formation is further corroborated by the activity observed for the use of linear peptides comprising cysteine residues in a biological medium."

The HMPB-ChemMatrix resin was prepared by swelling aminomethyl-ChemMatrix in DMF for 1 h followed by the addition of 4-(4-hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)-butyric acid (HMPBA) (3 equiv.), HBTU (3 equiv.), HOBt (3 equiv.) and N-methylmorpholine (NMM) (6 equiv.) respectively. After stirring the mixture for 3 h, the resin was washed with DMF (dimethylformamide) (5\u00d7) and DCM (dichloromethane) (5\u00d7) and dried under vacuum. The C-terminal amino acid was subsequently attached by dissolving Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH (5 equiv.) in DCM with a minimum amount of anhydrous THF, and adding the resulting solution to the previously prepared resin swollen in DCM. MSNT (1-(mesitylene-2-sulfonyl)-3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole) (5 equiv.) and N-methylimidazole (3.75 equiv.) were dissolved in DCM and incubated with the resin for 1 h under agitation. After washing the resin with DCM (5\u00d7) and DMF (5\u00d7), peptide elongation was carried out by standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis: the Fmoc protecting group was removed from the resin by two 10 min treatments with 20% piperidine in DMF (v/v); and amino acid couplings were performed using Fmoc-Xaa-OH (3 equiv.), HCTU (3 equiv.) and NMM (12 equiv.) in DMF (2\u00d730 min). Cleavage, side chain deprotection, and pseudoproline ring reopening were respectively achieved by treatment with TFA/TIPS (triisopropylsilane)/H2O/phenol (90:5:2.5:2.5) over a period of 1 h. After precipitation in cold ether, a second side chain deprotection treatment using TFA/TIPS/H2O (95:2.5:2.5) was performed to ensure complete deprotection and pseudoproline ring opening. The resulting peptide was subsequently precipitated using cold diethyl ether, washed twice with diethyl ether and dried under vacuum. Finally, the peptide was purified by RP-HPLC (Reversed phase HPLC) using a Shimadzu Prominence instrument equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex\u00ae EVO C18 column (250 mm\u00d721.2 mm, 5.0 m, 300 \u212b) and using 0.1% AcOH/H2O (solvent A) and 0.1% AcOH/CH3CN (solvent B) with a linear gradient of 5% to 50% (for solvent B) over a period of 20 min at 14 ml/min and UV detection at 220 and 254 nm respectively. The collected fractions were subsequently freeze-dried to afford the desired peptide as a white powder."

                                "Incorrect disulfide bond pairings such as in analogs 3a and 3b reduced inhibitory activity. These results suggest that the disulfide bonds may exist in a dynamic equilibrium that allows for some remodeling in the culture medium to produce a small quantity of the bioactive conformation. Surprisingly, equivalent antimicrobial activities were observed for linear analogs 1 and 4 in radial diffusion and microplate dilution assays (Table 2). These results support the in situ disulfide bond formation hypothesis proposing that suitable disulfide bonds can be formed in the bioassay medium without the help of chaperone-like proteins.[5] Based on the disulfide bond pairing ratios of 2a (7.5%), 2b (21.5%) and 2c (71.0%) obtained after cyclization with NCS and the similar antimicrobial activities, a similar equilibrium could be reached in culture medium containing linear analogues 1 and 4 but also native pediocin PA-1 3c. Substitution of all four cysteine residues with alanine showed that the disulfide bonds are essential for pediocin PA-1 activity, since linear analog 6 was inactive which lends further support for in situ disulfide bond of the linear analogues.",
