    "abstract": "A screening method for determining secondary structures of a protein or polypeptide without performing computer simulation, is provided. The screening method is based in part on the interaction between the electrostatic forces and the electrostatic displacement forces in the protein, and makes use of a set of computational conditional statements. The screening method includes determining both alpha helix and beta sheet structures based on hydrophobic character and charges of the residues, among other considerations. A method for determining an overall folded structure of a protein using a physics-based simulation method with an initial configuration of the protein prepared according to the secondary structure(s) determined by the screening method, is also provided.",

                        "The secondary and higher-order structures of a protein dictate its function and biological activity, and are therefore important to many fundamental life processes. Such structures can be determined experimentally through, for example, crystallography or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR). However, these experimental techniques are often limited to small-sized proteins. The sample preparation, data gathering and spectra interpretation for these techniques are usually highly time-consuming and complex.",
                        "In recent years, computational methods for protein structure prediction have been gaining increasing importance in structural biology. Current approaches to computational analysis often rely on comparisons to previously described (experimentally determined) sequences and structures. One of such approaches is homology modeling, which is based on sequence or structural alignment of the protein or polypeptide with a \u201ctemplate\u201d protein that has a known structure. However, for a protein of interest, a suitable template for homology analysis may be difficult to find, especially in the case of a novel artificial protein. Furthermore, even if such template can be found, an amino acid sequences to be analyzed may have different degrees of divergence from the template, and sequence homology modeling may be unable to predict the structure of those portions of the sequence that are unmatched by the template or their influence on the structure matched portions.",
                        "Alternatively, physics-based computational methods have been employed for protein structure determination. These methods include energy minimization, which is not able to sample the vast conformational space of a protein to obtain its native structure, and molecular dynamics simulations, which are computational resource-intensive and therefore can be limited to small proteins (or fractions of larger proteins) and short timescale molecular phenomena.",

The method is based, in part, on the recognition of the role of various considerations, including different forces as well as the size of the residues, in determining the secondary structures of a protein or polypeptide. One of such forces is short-range repulsive force that repels non-polar residues from the vicinity of highly charged residues.",
                        "In one aspect, the disclosed subject matter provides a screening method for determining secondary structures of a protein without performing computer simulation. The screening method is based in part on the interaction between the electrostatic forces and the electrostatic displacement forces in a subsequence on the protein, and makes use of a set of computational conditional statements. The screening method can include determining both alpha helix and beta sheet structures. The alpha helix determination can include searching for an opening hydrophilic residue and a closing hydrophilic residue spaced by the intervening residues. The opening and closing hydrophilic residues together with the intervening residues define a bracket of residues, and are subject to queries or evaluations using one or more of factors relating to the charge, hydrophobic character, and in some cases, the size (or mass) of the bracketed residues to determine the existence of an alpha helix. The beta sheet determination can include a comparison between the sum of charges of a consecutive sequence of residues and the sum of the hydrophobic character of the sequence. The screening method can be carried out by one or more computing devices, such as desktop computers, work stations, super computers, etc. The computing devices can include processors and computer-readable storage media (e.g., transient and permanent memories), where the processors can be configured to receive instructions loaded on the computer-readable storage media to perform the method.",

The computational method can makes use of the various forces described above, and can include the screening method to prepare an initial secondary structure of a protein for further simulation. The computational method can provide accurate three dimensional description of a protein, including its tertiary structure, in a highly efficient manner."

It is noted that in Eq. 4, the force is derived approximately as proportional to the inverse of the distance between the non-polar object and the external point charge to the 5th power. However, the force can also be described generally as being proportional to 1/rz, where z is a real number greater than 3, for example, from 3 to 6. The magnitude of the displacement forces acting upon a completely charge-neutral alpha helix sized object under the influence of an electronic point charge at about 0.1 nm distance is comparable to the Coulomb force between two opposite point charges a similar distance.",

This can be understood in terms of the repulsive force (or displacement force) as described by the second term of Eq. 5. Hydrophobic residues tend to aggregate whenever in close proximity to reduce interfacial energy with water unless blocked from doing so. When a sufficiently large charge exists in the intervening protein segments (e.g., charged residues) the repulsive component generates a large repulsive force. Since both hydrophobic residues are repelled by the same intervening charge(s), hydrophobic-hydrophobic residue aggregation is blocked, and the two hydrophobic residues are forced to separate (displaced) by incoming water drawing by the charge.",

On larger size-scales, the expression guides the generation of tertiary structures by determining the force between charged protein residues outside of the secondary structures and the secondary structures as a unit.",
                        "Based on the above considerations, including the relationship of forces described in Eq. 5, folded structures, e.g., secondary structure and/or higher ordered structures, of proteins can be determined using a detailed model of particle motion in appropriate fields with the appropriate constraint for protein backbone motion. For example, the computational methods for incorporating the forces into internal molecular rotation as described in the '639 application can be used. The relative location of residues and the hydrophobic and charge characteristics of each residue can be used as input parameters.",

The screening method can be based, in part, on the interplay between the electrostatic forces (the first term in Eq. 5) and the electrostatic displacement force (the second term in Eq. 5) of a subsequence on the protein. The screening method can be implemented in a computer program based on the following considerations.",

A residue on the amino acid sequence is first selected (210). If the residue is hydrophobic, the next residue is selected (230). The procedure is repeated until a hydrophilic residue is encountered. Whether a residue is hydrophilic can be determined by its hydrophobic character. The hydrophobic character and charge of amino acid residues are well known and can be found in the literature, e.g., Copeland, R. A., 1994, Methods for Protein Analysis, a practical guide to laboratory protocols, Chapman & Hall, New York, where positive values indicate hydrophilic residues and negative indicates hydrophobic residues.",

The following five amino acids in sequence (ni+2, ni+3, . . . ni+6) are queried to determine if there is a second hydrophilic residue (250). If a second hydrophilic residue cannot be found in the sequence (ni+2, ni+3, . . . ni+6), this procedure stops (260). Otherwise, the first occurrence of such a second hydrophilic residue marks the end point of the bracket (ni+J) (270). The screening method then checks the bracketed set against one or more of the following conditional rules (280). When any of these rules is tested true, the bracketed set is determined to be an alpha helix region.",

The summation of charges (Table 1 column 1) determines the overall charge and therefore the magnitude of the electric field exerting repulsive force on hydrophobic residues, a force that opposes hydrophobic residue aggregation and therefore alpha helix formation. The product of charge, as shown in column 2, is positive when there are equal numbers of same charged residues, and negative otherwise. This product of charge when combined with the summation of charge relates to the magnitude of electrostatic attractive (or repulsive) force.

If the residue is denoted unstructured (i.e., it is not previously determined to belong to an alpha helix or beta sheet region, 320), the next residue is selected (330). The procedure is repeated until an unstructured residue n, is encountered. A scanning bracket is opened using this unstructured residue as a starting residue (340), and its next 4 consecutive residues (ni+1 through ni+4) are queried to determine if they are all unstructured (350). If the answer is no, the procedure is stopped (360). Otherwise, a scanning bracket of residues ni through ni+4 is established (370). Beta sheet determination is then performed (380) based on the summation of the magnitude of charges and the summation of the hydrophobic character of each residue in the 5-residue bracket. For example, such a 5-residue bracket is determined to be a beta sheet when",

                        "The above procedure for beta sheet determination can be repeated for the entire amino acid sequence to obtain all of the beta sheet structures on the sequence.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows the results of the screening method performed on Ubiquitin, represented by the dashed line, as compared with its secondary structure determined by NMR, represented by the solid line. The horizontal axis represents the amino acid residue index number on the Ubiquitin sequence, and the vertical axis represents the denotation of each amino acid residue on the Ubiquitin sequence as either belonging to an alpha helix (an assigned value of 1), a beta sheet (value of 2), or an unstructured region (value of 0). As can be seen in FIG. 4, the screening method of the disclosed subject matter correctly identifies most of the secondary structure of Ubiquitin. It is important to note that the experiment itself can have a relatively large margin of error, which can be attributed to data interpretation, thermal fluctuations, and end point constraint on natural proteins (e.g., a residue neighboring an alpha helix may be physically close enough to be confused with an actual helix structure that is characterized by reduced energy). Considering these errors, the secondary structure determined according to the screening method approximates the accuracy of experimental results.",
                        "FIGS. 5A-5C show the results of secondary structure prediction using the disclosed screening method for a wide cross-section of proteins. The reference (experimental) structure was obtained from Rost, B., \u201cReview: Protein secondary structure prediction continues to rise\u201d, J. Struct. Bio., no. 134, pp 204-218, 2001. The screening method found essentially all of the secondary structures and correctly determined their character. The accuracy of this procedure has been tested on hundreds of proteins producing accuracies of \u02dc70\u00b19% for alpha helix and \u02dc66\u00b114% for beta sheet identification (residue-by-residue comparison between model and experimental for proper secondary structure assignment). The core secondary structure identification has greater accuracy: \u02dc75\u00b17% and \u02dc70\u00b112% for helices and beta-sheet respectively.",
                        "Further, Table 2 below compares the accuracy of the disclosed screening methods relative to another popular model as embodied in commercial PSIPRED described in the literature. The commercial PSIPRED is based on recognized (statistically analyzed) correlations between a given amino acid sequence and the corresponding experimentally determined structure, and does not depend on physical parameters or perform physics-based calculations. Reference for theoretical background of the PSIPRED program can be found in Jones D T, (1999) Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices. J Mol Biol 292:195-202. Again, the data in the table demonstrate the accuracy of the screening method in secondary structure determination.",
                        "After determining all the alpha helix and beta sheet structures of an amino acid sequence using the above-described screening method, an initial three dimensional representation (or conformation) of the sequence can be built with the amino acid residues with the appropriate geometries required by the alpha helices and beta sheets as determined. The portion of the protein not belonging to any determined alpha helix or beta sheet, i.e., the unstructured portion, can be built as a linear chain, or in an arbitrary physically permissible conformation. Residue properties including charge, hydrophobic character, mass, etc., can be assigned to an appropriate alpha-carbon atom of each residue of the protein. In addition, for each alpha helix or beta sheet identified in the screening method, the alpha helix or beta sheet can be tagged accordingly with aggregate or summed properties (summed charges, summed hydrophobic character, etc.).",
                        "Physics-based computer simulations can then be employed based on the above initial conformations and assigned properties to obtain the tertiary or higher-order structures of the amino acid sequence, as shown in FIG. 1. For example, the methods described in the '639 application for rotating the protein along torsional angles on the protein backbone using effective torques can be used to fold the protein to obtain an overall folded protein structure. Each secondary structure identified in the screening method can be treated as a unit with the summed properties, in which case the internal conformation of these secondary structures are not allowed to change during the simulated folding. This leads to fast convergence of the computational method to arrive at a stable conformation, where higher-ordered structure can be determined. For example, if a physics-based simulation method of the '639 application (i.e., the method based on the mobility of Eq. 2 to account for global factors and the forces represented by Eq. 5) is used, the simulated folding can converge in less than a minute of a desktop computer CPU time to arrive at RMSD values in the 4-5 \u212b as compared to an experimentally determined structure. Simulations of approximately 10-20 Kilo-Dalton proteins on a desktop computer can predict the full three dimensional protein tertiary structure with RMSD values in the 5-10 Angstroms range. Alternatively, the secondary structures can be allowed to change in the simulated folding to examine the influences of the chain segments surrounding the secondary structures on the secondary structures in the folding process.",
                        "FIG. 6 shows a comparison of the overall structure of protein Villin as determined experimentally by NMR (in 6A), and by the physics-based computational method as described above (6B). The superposition (6C) of the structures of 6A and 6B indicates that the method of the disclosed matter has reproduced substantially the \u201creal\u201d structure of Villin.",
                        "Table 3 below shows the simulation result of various proteins ranging from 30 to 157 amino acid sequences from physics-based model of the disclosed subject matter using the structures determined by PSIPRED as a reference. Average RMSD value for these sequences relative to experiment (NMR data) was found to be 4.9\u00b11.08 \u212b. The largest protein reported was the human protein tyrosin phosphotome with 320 amino acids. The method of the disclosed subject matter produced a RMSD value of \u02dc8 \u212b. This value is reasonable relative to alternative ab-initio methods for a protein of this size. The RMSD values can be further improved by using molecular dynamics to relax the simulated results, for example, by the AMBER program running on a computer (e.g., a supercomputer).",
                        "The methods of the disclosed subject matter can take an arbitrary amino acid sequence as input, and can therefore be used to classify, identify, and investigate shape change dynamics of any given protein or polypeptide. The methods can further be used to gain insight into function-structure relationship, such as the effects of mutation on the structure and function of a protein.",
