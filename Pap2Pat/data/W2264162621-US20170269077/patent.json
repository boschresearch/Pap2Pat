                        "The development of accurate, inexpensive, and high fidelity tools for biomarker discovery for routine diagnostic assays to detect the presence of an autoimmune disease is crucial to meet the clinical needs of early detection of disease for developing a preventative strategy. Detection of antibodies correlated with an autoimmune disease through binding to the biomarkers is one of the main approaches for the diagnosis of many diseases, including autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and cancers.1-3 Indeed, the development of antibody-based diagnostic assays has been intensively pursued for the diagnosis and treatment of disease, however only a small number of biomarkers have been identified as effective disease markers.1,4 There are many challenges to the development of biomarkers, such as heterogeneity of antibodies, variability of host responses, and reagents among others. However, improved methods of discovery of biomarkers and improved biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of disease are needed to better identify and treat patient populations.",
                        "One such autoimmune disease is celiac disease. Celiac disease, also known as coeliac disease or celiac sprue (coeliac sprue), affects approximately 1% of people in Europe and North America. In many of those affected, celiac disease is unrecognised, but this clinical oversight is now being rectified with greater clinical awareness. A gluten free diet is the only current treatment for celiac disease, and because regular ingestion of as little as 50 mg of gluten (equivalent to 1/100th of a standard slice of bread) damages the small intestine, chronic inflammation of the small bowel is commonplace in subjects on a gluten free diet. Persistent inflammation of the small intestine has been shown to increase the risk of cancer, osteoporosis and death. As gluten is so widely used, for example, in commercial soups, sauces, ice-creams, etc., maintaining a gluten free diet is difficult. Therefore novel epitopes for diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease are needed."

                        "Celiac disease is a good model to explore the early stage of disease development as one of the representative autoimmune diseases, because the target protein, gluten, which storage proteins from wheat, barley, and rye, are well known to be immunogenic10-12. While the pathogenesis of celiac disease appears to be T-cell mediated,13 the diagnosis relies on the presence of self-reactive antibodies. The most common antibodies currently in use are directed against host proteins such as tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and endomysium10, and may serve as markers of autoimmunity rather than as participants in the initiation of the disease, which results from responses to gluten proteins.14 Further, the production of these antibodies can be used to predict the stage and severity of disease and to monitor dietary compliance; however, they lack the ability to discriminate amongst clinically relevant phenotypes. Gliadin specific antibodies provide examples that have not shown adequate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CD. Further, it is not understood how gliadin specific antibodies and epitopes contribute to the pathogenesis of celiac disease, especially in the early stage of development.15-18",
                        "How the pathogenic epitopes are recognized by B cells and evolved in celiac disease may help in understanding both the mechanism of disease initiation and to develop better clinical tools. Such epitopes of gliadin peptides may be modified by transglutaminase and evolved toward being more immunogenic to host. To demonstrate the possibility of a novel technology for identifying the biomarker for CD diagnosis, continuous epitopes of gliadin with post-translational modified peptide sequences, discontinuous peptide sequences, which were combined with peptide sequences of gliadin, and random 3- or 6-mer peptide sequences were synthesized. Methods for identifying the biomarker of CD diagnosis by the novel platform and technology with semiconductor high volume manufacturing process to generate continuous and discontinuous peptide sequences from the established antigen in an autoimmune disease are described herein.",

Some embodiments include novel and selective polyepitode-containing peptides that are agents or vaccines for treating and diagnosing celiac disease. In some embodiments, the polyepitode-containing peptides are antigens that modulate a T cell response of a subject who is sensitive to gluten or who has celiac disease. Examples of these polyepitode-containing and celiac active peptides, which are optionally amidated at the C-termini, are provided in Tables 1 and 2.",

For example, a variant can comprise one or more amino acid substitutions in any one or more of the peptides. As used herein, \u201csubstituted\u201d or \u201csubstitution\u201d includes substitution, replacement, addition, insertion, omission and/or deletion (as such variants may also be fragments) of an amino acid residue(s). In particular, this refers to peptides having conservative substitution without losing, or significantly diminishing, their use in the methods of the invention. Preferably, biologically active variants are capable of generating a substantially equal or greater T cell response in a subject sensitive to gluten as the peptide from which it is derived. In another embodiment, biologically active variants are capable of generating at least 50%, more preferably at least 75% of the T cell response in a subject sensitive to gluten as the peptide from which it is derived.",

Percentage identity can be determined using readily available software packages, such as BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and GAP.Natural amino acids include alanine (A), arginine (R), asparagine (N), aspartic acid (D), cysteine (C), glutamine (Q), glutamic acid (E), glycine (G), histidine (H), isoleucine (I), leucine (L), lysine (K), methionine (M), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), serine (S), threonine (T), tryptophan (W), tyrosine (Y), valine (V), hydroxyproline (O and/or Hyp), isodityrosine (IDT), and di-isodityrosine (di-IDT). Hydroxyproline, isodityrosine, and di-isodityrosine are formed post-translationally. Use of natural amino acids, in particular the 20 genetically encoded amino acids, is particularly contemplated.",

                                "Peptide variants may be produced by mutagenesis or other chemical methods. Alanine scanning is a useful technique for identifying important amino acids. In this technique, an amino acid residue is replaced by Ala and its effect on the peptide's activity is determined. For example, cysteine residues may be substituted to minimise dimerisation via disulfide linkages. Each of the amino acid residues of the peptide is analysed in this manner to determine the important regions of the peptide. Means for preparing such peptides are well understood in the art.",
                                "In addition to naturally occurring amino acids, non-naturally occurring amino acids, or modified amino acids, are also contemplated and within the scope of the invention.

Examples of such protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids and boronic acids, ethers of alcohols and acetals, and ketals of aldehydes and ketones. Examples of suitable groups include acyl protecting groups such as, for example, furoyl, formyl, adipyl, azelayl, suberyl, dansyl, acetyl, theyl, benzoyl, trifluoroacetyl, succinyl and methoxysuccinyl; aromatic urethane protecting groups such as, for example, benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz); aliphatic urethane protecting groups such as, for example, t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl (FMOC); pyroglutamate and amidation. Many other modifications providing increased potency, prolonged activity, ease of purification, and/or increased half-life will be known to the person skilled in the art.",

                                "The peptides may comprise one or more modifications, which may be natural post-translation modifications or artificial modifications. The modification may provide a chemical moiety (typically by substitution of a hydrogen, for example, of a C\u2014H bond), such as an amino, acetyl, acyl, carboxy, hydroxy or halogen (for example, fluorine) group, or a carbohydrate group. Typically, the modification is present on the N- or C-terminal. Furthermore, one or more of the peptides may be PEGylated, where the PEG (polyethyleneoxy group) provides for enhanced lifetime in the blood stream. One or more of the peptides may also be combined as a fusion or chimeric protein with other proteins, or with specific binding agents that allow targeting to specific moieties on a target cell.",

The present invention contemplates all such forms, including cis-(Z) and trans-(E) isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as, falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent, such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.",
                                "In another example, to prevent cleavage by peptidases, any one or more of the peptides may include a non cleavable peptide bond in place of a particularly sensitive peptide bond to provide a more stable peptide. Such non cleavable peptide bonds may include beta amino acids.",
                                "In certain embodiments, any one or more of the peptides may include a functional group, for example, in place of the scissile peptide bond, which facilitates inhibition of a serine-, cysteine- or aspartate-type protease, as appropriate. For example, the invention includes a peptidyl diketone or a peptidyl keto ester, a peptide haloalkylketone, a peptide sulfonyl fluoride, a peptidyl boronate, a peptide epoxide, a peptidyl diazomethane, a peptidyl phosphonate, isocoumarins, benzoxazin-4-ones, carbamates, isocyantes, isatoic anhydrides or the like. Such functional groups have been provided in other peptide molecules, and general routes for their synthesis are known.",
                                "A variant may be a mimetic. The term \u201cmimetic\u201d is intended to refer to a substance which has some chemical similarity to the molecule it mimics and retains a particular activity of interest (for example, inducing tolerance). The underlying rationale behind the use of peptide mimetics, is that the peptide backbone of proteins exists chiefly to orient amino acid side chains in such a way as to facilitate molecular interactions, such as those of T cell and MHC-peptide, antibody and antigen, enzyme and substrate or scaffolding proteins. A peptide mimetic is designed to permit molecular interactions similar to the natural molecule. Mimetics include olefins, phosphonates, aza-amino acid analogues and the like. Persons skilled in the art would readily appreciate methods for designing mimetics of peptides and would be able to utilise them to design mimetics of the peptides defined herein.",
                                "The peptides may be analysed by hydrophilicity analysis, which can be used to identify the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the peptide, thus aiding in the design of peptides for experimental manipulation, such as in binding experiments, antibody synthesis, etc. Secondary structural analysis may also be performed to identify regions of a peptide that adopt specific structural motifs. Manipulation, translation, secondary structure prediction, hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity profiles, open reading frame prediction and plotting, and determination of sequence homologies, can be accomplished using computer software programs available in the art. Other methods of structural analysis including, but not limited to, X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry and gas chromatography, computer modelling, optical rotary dispersion (ORD), or circular dichroism (CD) may also be used.",
                                "The peptides, fragments or variants may be in a salt form, preferably, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. \u201cA pharmaceutically acceptable salt form\u201d includes the conventional non-toxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of a peptide, for example, from non-toxic organic or inorganic acids. Conventional non-toxic salts include, for example, those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromic, sulphuric, sulfonic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmitic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicyclic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like.",
                                "The peptides can be provided in the agent or vaccine as separate peptides or linked, for example, in a polyepitope structure. In one embodiment, the peptides may be presented in a single polypeptide chain (polyepitope string), i.e., in a linear or circular arrangement. In another embodiment, the peptides can be presented in a multiple antigen presentation system, particularly based on a dendrimer backbone such as polylysine. A polylysine backbone provides a non-linear, branched arrangement of epitopes. This system provides the advantage over a polyepitope string that the peptides do not interfere with each other or be liable to cleavage into cryptic epitopes and thus are able to induce a full T cell response.",

                                "In one embodiment, a non-specific linker is included between the compound and the peptide to which it is conjugated. Such a linker is not involved in peptide activity. Rather the linker may serve as a spacer between the peptide and a functional moiety. Uses for a linker include immobilization of the peptide, such as to aid purification or detection. Alternatively, a linker may allow attachment of a compound to the peptide that enables specific delivery of the peptide to a particular target, such as a cell or tissue, spatially or temporally. When used as a vaccine, one or more of the peptides may be coupled to a linker that serves as a spacer between the peptide and an immunogenic carrier, or permits improved coupling between the peptide and the immunogenic carrier and prevents the formation of cryptic epitopes.",
                                "In one embodiment, one or more of the peptides are covalently coupled to an adjuvant (immunogenic carrier protein), such as diphtheria toxoid (DT), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), tetanus toxoid (TT) or the nuclear protein of influenza virus (NP), to increase their immunogenicity, using any of several conjugation chemistries known in the art. A non-specific linker can be present between the peptide and the immunogenic carrier and is preferably joined to the peptide or co-synthesised to facilitate coupling to the immunogenic carrier and/or to serve as a spacer between the peptide and the immunogenic carrier.",
                                "When used as a diagnostic agent, one or more of the peptides are preferably conjugated to an immunogenic carrier that was not previously used for vaccination. When monitoring the success of vaccination, this prevents the diagnostic agent from reacting to antibodies that were formed against the carrier fraction of the vaccine.",
                                "In one embodiment, the compound is an MHC class II molecule or peptide binding fragment thereof. The MHC class II molecule may be purified from a biological sample. Alternatively, the MHC class II molecule may be recombinantly produced. A peptide binding fragment of the MHC class II molecule can be obtained, for example, by enzymatic cleavage of the purified or recombinant intact molecule. Alternatively, the peptide binding fragment may be recombinantly produced. In a preferred embodiment, the compound is a recombinant two domain MHC class II molecule.",
                                "In their most basic form, the two domain MHC class II molecule comprises the al and 131 domain of a mammalian MHC class II molecule wherein the amino terminus of the al domain is covalently linked to the carboxy terminus of the 131 domain and wherein the polypeptide does not include the \u03b12 or \u03b22 domains. The two domain MHC class II molecule is associated by covalent or non-covalent interaction with a peptide defined herein. In certain embodiments, the peptide is covalently linked to the amino terminus of the \u03b21 domain of the class II molecule. The two domain MHC class II molecule may also comprise a detectable label, such as a fluorescent label, or a toxin. Where the detectable label or toxin is to be covalently linked to the MHC molecule in a directed manner (i.e., rather than being randomly attached) it will generally be linked to the carboxy terminus of the molecule so as to minimise interference with the peptide antigen linked at the amino terminus.",
                                "In vitro, the two domain MHC class II molecule may be used to detect and quantify T-cells, and regulate T-cell function. Thus, such molecules loaded with a selected peptide may be used to detect, monitor and quantify the population of T cells that are specific for that peptide. The two domain MHC class II molecule/peptide conjugate may also be used to induce anergy of gluten-specific T-cells, alleviating symptoms associated with celiac disease. Alternatively, such molecules may be conjugated with a toxin to more directly kill the disease-causing T cells. Suitable toxins include protein toxins (for example, ricin, diphtheria, and Pseudomonas toxin), chemotherapeutic agents (for example, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, methotrexate, cytotoxin, and antisense RNA), antibodies to a cytotoxic T-cell surface molecule, lipases, and radioisotopes emitting \u201chard\u201d, for example, beta radiation.",

For example, the APCs may express HLA-DQ2 (for example, HLA DQA1*05 and HLA DQB1*02) and/or HLA DQ8. The APCs employed for this purpose may be isolated from the subject to whom they are to be delivered after loading, or they may be obtained from an allo-matched subject.",
                                "By \u201cloading\u201d an APC it is meant that the APC is incubated or transfected with the peptides, a biologically active fragment or variant of one or more thereof, or a polynucleotide encoding one or more thereof. Loading an APC can be achieved by using conventional nucleic acid transfection methods, such as lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, and calcium phosphate transfection.",

                                "The peptides may be synthesised by standard chemistry techniques, including synthesis by automated procedure using a commercially available peptide synthesiser. In general, peptide analogues are prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis methodology which may involve coupling each protected amino acid residue to a resin support, preferably a 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin, by activation with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to yield a peptide with a C-terminal amide. Alternatively, a chloromethyl resin (Merrifield resin) may be used to yield a peptide with a free carboxylic acid at the C-terminal. After the last residue has been attached, the protected peptide-resin is treated with hydrogen fluoride to cleave the peptide from the resin, as well as deprotect the side chain functional groups. Crude product can be further purified by gel filtration, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), partition chromatography, or ion-exchange chromatography.",
                                "If desired, and as outlined above, various groups may be introduced into the peptide of the agent during synthesis or during expression, which allow for linking to other molecules or to a surface. For example, cysteines can be used to make thioethers, histidines for linking to a metal ion complex, carboxyl groups for forming amides or esters, amino groups for forming amides, and the like.",
                                "The peptides may also be produced using cell-free translation systems. Standard translation systems, such as reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts, use RNA as a template; whereas \u201ccoupled\u201d and \u201clinked\u201d systems start with DNA templates, which are transcribed into RNA then translated.",

Once epitope sequences are discovered, they are recombined with random sequences or other discovered epitope sequences to generate new synthetic polypeptide sequences with greater sensitivity and specificity for binding to antibodies associated with an autoimmune disorder than the native epitopes alone.

Optionally, steps 5 through 7 may be repeated to further refine the sensitivity and/or specificity of the synthetic polypeptides to binding of an antibody associated with an autoimmune disorder.

A diagram of an embodiment with a step size of 2 amino acids is shown in FIG. 1 with a polypeptide fragment length of 12 amino acids. This results in an overlap of 10 amino acids between neighboring polypeptide fragments. The overlap allows more precise determination of active epitope sequences on the bioactive polypeptide sequence. In some embodiments, the step size may vary, e.g., the step size may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acids. In a preferred embodiment, the step size is 2 amino acids.

Information about the binding of each polypeptide fragment to an antibody in a samples from a subject identified as having or not having the autoimmune disorder are compared to determine sensitivity and specificity of each peptide.

Treg cells are characterised by their capacity to produce large amounts of IL-10 and TGF\u03b2. IL-10 is considered to be one of the main cytokines involved in immunosuppression; a target for suppression seems to be the transcriptional control of IL-2 in effector cells.",

Effects of peptide administration down stream to cognate T cells could be assessed using immune cell types, tissues, biological fluids (for example, plasma, intestinal secretions, urine or stool).",
                                "In general the biological effects of peptides recognised by cognate T cells are either pro-inflammatory or tolerogenic, depending on the dose regimen, mode of administration and whether the peptides are modified or co-administered with another compound that has immunological properties, for example, an adjuvant. These and other peptides selected for use in peptide based therapeutic vaccines are generally short (<29 amino acids), aqueous-soluble, without innate immune effects and recognised by a substantial proportion of pathogenic T ells. Based upon observations in animal models of T cell mediated disease and in other human diseases, initial administration would be followed by activation of cognate T cells. However, repeated administration of the agent is expected to induce T cell anergy and/or tolerance. Ongoing regular peptide administration would be expected to maintain tolerance to gluten, suppress inflammation in the small intestine and inhibit pro-inflammatory gluten-specific T cells throughout the body.",

Surrogate markers of immunity likely to predict normal or inflamed intestinal tissue after gluten ingestion includes a wide range of assays utilizing pure or crude mixtures of immune cells, biological fluids, or tissue samples, to measure soluble or cell-associated proteins or small molecules associated with immune activation, inflammation, or tolerance. These assays are well-known to immunologists, immuno-histologists, and clinicians familiar with immune diseases in rodents, humans, and in particular, celiac disease. Markers, more specifically, that assess the activity of celiac disease and gluten-induced immunity include small bowel histology, serum IgA and IgG specific gliadin (protein or peptide) and for various host proteins including tTG.",

                                "(a) Direct effects of peptides on the CD4+ T cell isolated from blood or tissue can be monitored ex vivolin vitro by peptide-stimulated cytokine release, T-cell proliferation, or determination of CD4+ T cell markers that may be altered in vivo.",
                                "(b) The frequency and phenotype of individual CD4+ T cells specific for the peptides or gluten generally can be assessed by direct enumeration of cells, for example, by FACS analysis. Oral ingestion of gluten in patients with celiac disease normally following a gluten free diet is known to stimulate T cells specific for the peptides and gluten generally. A clinical test such as gluten challenge may be used to assess the T cells induced in blood or other tissues. The phenotype of isolated T cells could then be assessed fresh or following short-term expansion in vitro. Assays of T cells may rely upon MHC-peptide complexes, antigen-stimulated intracellular cytokine, or other cell surface markers induced on antigen-activated T cells. Functional status of CD4+ T cells is correlated with the presence of various cell-surface and intra-cellular markers, for example, activation markers including CD25 and CD69, or of \u201ctolerance\u201d and regulatory T cell function, for example, GITR and FOXP3. Production of cytokines such as IFN\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and of IL-17 would be considered pro-inflammatory for classic Th1, Th2 or Th17 pro-inflammatory immune responses. In contrast, secretion of IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 are associated with tolerogenic immune responses. It would be expected markers of pro-inflammatory immune responses would decline and/or markers of tolerogenic immune responses would strengthen.",
                                "(c) Effects of peptides on CD4+ T cells can also be measured using mixtures of cells, for example, whole blood, PBMC, mononuclear cells isolated from tissue, or using tissue incubated with the peptides. Assays capable of measuring individual or multiple proteins or RNA encoding relevant immunological or disease-associated proteins such as cytokines and chemokines could be assessed after short-term incubation with the peptides. Assays such as IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot using PBMC before and or after administration of gluten or peptides themselves to the patient, or multiplex assays of chemokines and cytokines using PBMC are capable of detecting the biological effects of peptide-specific T cells from patients. The therapeutic effect of the peptides would be indicated by a shift from markers associated with pro-inflammatory immune responses to markers associated with immune tolerance (for example, IL-10) and general reduction in pro-inflammatory markers such as IFN-\u03b3.",
                                "(d) Effects of peptides on tissue may be practical; functional assays could take the form of direct application of peptide to the skin to assess delayed-type hypersensitivity, as in the Mantoux test for tuberculosis, which involves intradermal application of PPD (purified protein derivative) and assessment of the diameter of redness at the injection site 24-72 h later. The peptides may also be applied to other mucosal and skin sites to assess in the same manner. In clinical practice, it is both the peptide and grain derived protein-stimulated immune response that is important in celiac disease. For example, it is predicted that immunotherapy using the selected peptides would not only lead to suppression of the immune response stimulated by T cells specific for the peptides but also \u201ctolerance\u201d would be \u201cinfectious\u201d and also lead to suppression of pro-inflammatory immunity to other gluten-derived peptides and gluten itself. Hence, the effects of the peptide therapy could also be monitored using gluten from various grains (wheat, rye, barley) in celiac disease, in place of peptide in the assays described above. Indeed, peptide therapy for cat-sensitive asthma has been monitored by such a skin test utilizing the whole protein antigen from which the therapeutic peptides are derived (Oldfield et al., 2002).",
                                "(e) Ultimately, the clinical effects of the peptide immunotherapy would be assessed by histologic examination of tissues exposed to dietary gluten, typically the small bowel, but in experimental settings oral and rectal mucosa have also bee assessed, and in principle other sites such as oesophagus and colon might also be assessed. Tissue from these sites could be collected by direct visualization, typically by endoscopic biopsy. Direct visualization by endoscopy has also been used to diagnose celiac disease according to the appearance of the mucosa-villous atrophy can be assessed by standard as well as magnifying and capsule endoscopy. Hence, the tolerogenic effects of the peptides may be assessed simply by detection of macroscopic tissue damage in the gastrointestinal tract.",
                                "(f) Immunoglobulin specific for the peptides or other gluten peptides, or autoantigens relevant to celiac disease would provide markers of gluten immunity relevant to disease activity, and to opsonising activity that may compromise the therapeutic effects of the peptides themselves.",
                                "(g) Presence of markers associated with anaphylaxis, such as peptide- or gluten-specific IgE or histamine release by peripheral blood basophils may also be used to predict complications of peptide immunotherapy and need to adjust or cease therapy.",

In one example, the proteolytic product is detected, for example, using SDS-PAGE, HPLC, ELIZA, or Western Blot. In a further example, the peptide is fused to a fluorescent donor and a quenching acceptor so as to enable intramolecular resonance energy transfer between the fluorescent donor and the quenching acceptor. Upon cleavage, the donor and acceptor are separated, allowing detection of the donor's fluorescent emission. Typically the peptide separates the fluorescent donor and the quenching acceptor at a distance of less than about 100 angstroms. The fluorescent donor can be attached to the peptide's C-terminus, and the quenching acceptor can be attached to the peptide's N-terminus, or vice versa.",

Such chemical amplification thus makes possible an overall quantum yield (the number of material reactions divided by number of absorbed photons) of up to several hundred. A CA resist typically contains a small amount (app. 1-5% by weight) of radiation-sensitive catalyst precursor, e.g., a photoacid generator (PAG); a plurality of chemical groups that can react by elimination, addition, or rearrangement in the presence of catalyst; a polymer matrix able to disperse other components in a smooth clear film; and optional additives to improve performance or processability, e.g., surfactants, photosensitizers, and etch resistors.",

In some embodiments, provided herein is a method of stripping the photoresist completely with deionized (DI) water. This process is accomplished in a developer module. The wafer is spun on a vacuum chuck for, e.g., 60 seconds to 90 seconds and deionized water is dispensed through a nozzle for about 30 seconds.",
                                "The photoactive coupling formulation can be applied to the surface in a coupling spin module. A coupling spin module can typically have 20 nozzles or more to feed the photoactive coupling formulation. These nozzles can be made to dispense the photoactive coupling formulation by means of pressurizing the cylinders that hold these solutions or by a pump that dispenses the required amount. In some embodiments, the pump is employed to dispense 5-8 cc of the photoactive coupling formulation onto the substrate. The substrate is spun on a vacuum chuck for 15-30 seconds and the photoactive coupling formulation is dispensed. The spin speed can be set to 2000 to 2500 rpm.",

The cap film coat solution can be prepared as follows: a solvent, a polymer, and a coupling molecule. The solvent that can be used can be an organic solvent like N methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide, or combinations thereof. The capping molecule is typically acetic anhydride and the polymer can be polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polymethyl methacrylate, poly (methyl iso propenyl) ketone, or poly (2 methyl pentene 1 sulfone). In some embodiments, the capping molecule is ethanolamine.",

A capping spin module can include one nozzle that can be made to dispense the cap film coat solution onto the substrate. This solution can be dispensed through pressurizing the cylinder that stores the cap film coat solution or through a pump that precisely dispenses the required amount. In some embodiments, a pump is used to dispense around 5-8 cc of the cap coat solution onto the substrate. The substrate is spun on a vacuum chuck for 15-30 seconds and the coupling formulation is dispensed. The spin speed can be set to 2000 to 2500 rpm.",

A capping bake module is a hot plate set up specifically to receive wafers just after the capping film coat is applied. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method of baking the spin coated capping coat solution in a hot plate to accelerate the capping reaction significantly. Hot plate baking generally reduces the capping time for amino acids to less than two minutes.",

                                "In some embodiments, an array comprising a surface of free carboxylic acids is used to synthesize polypeptides in an N\u2192C orientation. In one embodiment, the carboxylic acids on the surface of the substrate are activated (e.g., converted to a carbonyl) to allow them to bind to free amine groups on an amino acid. In one embodiment, activation of carboxylic acids on the group of the surface can be done by addition of a solution comprising a carbodiimide or succinimide to the surface of the array. In some embodiments, carboxylic acids can be activated by addition of a solution comprising 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide [EDC], N-hydroxysuccinimide [NHS], 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide [DIC], hydroxybenzotriazole [HOBt], 1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole [HOAt], (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) [HATU], benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate [PyBOP], or N,N-diisopropylethylamine [DIEA] to the surface of the array. The activation solution is washed away and the surface of the array is prepared for addition of an amino acid layer (i.e., one amino acid at each activated carboxylic acid group). Carboxylic acid groups remain activated for up to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 hours.",
                                "Addition of a solution comprising an amino acid with a free amine group to the activated carboxylic acid surface of the array results in binding of a single amino acid to each carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, the amino acid comprises an amino acid with protected amine groups. Using a photosensitive chemical reaction, the protecting group can be removed from the amine group of selected amino acids at site-specific locations using a reticle. For example, Fmoc-protected amino acids are mixed in a solution comprising a photobase generator. Upon exposure of the solution on the array to a specific frequency of light at site-specific locations, the photobase generator will release a base which will deprotect the amino acid, resulting in coupling of the amino acid to the activated carboxylic acid group on the surface of the array. Another method involves using a protected base that is then unprotected by a photoacid released by a photoacid generator upon light exposure. In some embodiments, the protected base is N-Boc-piperidine or 1,4-bis(N-Boc)-piperazine.",
                                "After a completed layer of amino acids is coupled, remaining uncoupled activated carboxylic acids are capped to prevent nonspecific binding of amino acids on subsequent synthesis steps. The steps of activation, addition of an amino acid layer, and capping are repeated as necessary to synthesize the desired polypeptides at specific locations on the array.",
                                "In some embodiments, peptides synthesized in the N\u2192C terminus direction can be capped with a diamine molecule to enhance binding properties of selected polypeptide sequences to a biological molecule, e.g., an antibody. In other embodiments, peptides synthesized in the C\u2192N direction can be capped with a dicarboxylic acid molecule to enhance binding properties of selected sequences to a biological molecule.",

Due to stability of the activated ester for an extended period of time, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more coupling cycles may be completed after a single activation step (e.g., to couple an entire layer of 2-25 or more different amino acids at different locations on the array). As the coupling occurs during hard bake (heating in a hot plate at 85-90\u00b0 Celsius for 90 seconds immediately after coating) and due to the presence of excess amino acid in the solution, complete 100% deprotection of Fmoc-protected amino acid may not be required for significantly high coupling yields. After addition of all amino acids and capping, all free activated carboxylic acids are either coupled or capped, thus resulting in high efficiency and accuracy of polypeptide synthesis.",

Biomarkers can be used for the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and management of diseases. Biomarkers may be expressed, or absent, or at a different level in an individual, depending on the disease condition, stage of the disease, and response to disease treatment. Biomarkers can be, e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins (e.g., enzymes such as kinases), sugars, salts, fats, lipids, or ions.",

The arrays can be used to identify known biomarkers to determine the appropriate treatment group. For example, a sample from a subject with a condition can be applied to an array. Binding to the array may indicate the presence of a biomarker for a condition.

The biomarkers include a set of peptides obtained from known antigens in celiac disease, including, but not limited to alpha, beta, gamma, and omega gliadin, tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and the deamidated modification thereof. The method includes synthesizing a peptide library of 12-mer peptides based on these known celiac antigens. In some embodiments, sequences of the 12-mer peptides are identified by shifting through the amino acid sequences of the known celiac antigens by either two or three amino acid at a time. FIG. 1A illustrates identifying 12-mer sequences based on shifting by two amino acids along the alpha/beta gliadin sequence. FIG. 1B illustrates deaminating the 12-mer peptides one or two glutamines at a time to increase the size of the peptide library. The peptide library was then synthesized on a microarray, as described in more detail below, which were found to be significantly better than other conventional peptide synthesis techniques. The coupling yield during synthesis of the peptides on the array was continually monitored for peptide yield, purity and sequence fidelity using fluorescence, mass spectrometry, and monoclonal antibody binding substrate assays. To identify biomarkers based on B cell epitopes of native and deamidated gliadin derived peptides (GPs), peptide microarrays including 2.1 million different peptides from the peptide library of GPs, including triple duplicates of each peptide, were synthesized, picked and placed onto 96 pillar plates."

The incoming amino acid activation solution was spin coated onto a wafer at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and soft baked at 65\u00b0 Celsius for 1 minute in a hot plate.

As described above, tetrazole thione upon exposure releases a carbodiimide and selective activation of amino acid was achieved in the exposed features. Therefore, the incoming Fmoc-protected amino acid present in the activation solution was activated and coupled to the unprotected amine present on the wafer in the same step completing the coupling of one layer of amino acid. Each coupling layer comprises reticles for each incoming Fmoc amino acid to be coupled, which expose features independent of the other reticles used for the same layer. After coupling all amino acids for a particular layer, the wafer was then spin coated with a solution of 50 weight % of NMP and 50 weight % of acetic anhydride to cap any remaining unprotected amine of the wafer that had no amino acid coupled for this particular layer.

To improve diagnostic accuracy for CD, a novel set of sequences was determined by combining 3-mer subsequences having a high occurrence rate included in this matrix table with other high-occurrence 3-mer sequences from the matrix table, random 3-mer or random 6-mer peptides to form 6-mer, 9-mer, 12-mer and 15-mer peptides, respectively. To assess the accuracies of the newly randomized peptide biomarker sequences (6-mers to 15-mers) for the CD diagnosis, random forest (RF),20 which is a statistical algorithm that creates voting classes of decision-making trees to evaluate the significance of each biomarker and classify samples, was used. The newly identified and RF-validated peptide sequences were then synthesized on a 110k peptide microarray with triple duplicates. 127 newly randomized and different peptides (SEQ ID NOS: 1-127) of these newly randomized peptide sequences displayed significantly improved sensitivity (IgG=97% or IgA=99%) and specificity (98% or 100%) (p<0.001) for CD diagnosis, when compared to the peptide set #1 and #2 from Example 5 using the current standard CD serology test with ELISA kits (Table 6). Table 1 and 2 lists the 127 peptides (SEQ ID NOS: 1-127) divided into sets #3 and #4 based on the peptides activity in either the IgG or the IgA assay, respectively.

CDA was defined with positivity to both tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA and endomysial antibodies (EMA), with a high predictive value for biopsy proven celiac disease.

Since immune response typifying CD may require proteins from wheat and like grains, the discovery power of this novel ultra through put platform was used to systematically search both linear continuous as well as discontinuous peptides derived from all known proteins. A set of novel epitopes was identified with a novel method with the set composed of discontinuous peptide sequences derived of the deamidated gliadin, that were recognized by the circulating antibodies found in the sera of patients with CD, showing high sensitivity and specificity for discriminating CD from controls. These 9-mer to 15-mer sequences, which are different from the known 33-mer gliadin sequence21, represent novel and heretofore unidentified B cell epitopes of gliadin. The identified peptides were subjected to a rigorous test of significance and predictive values by running a validation cohort from a community based samples that played no part in their selection with certain seropositive and other biopsy positive samples. Validation showed high accuracy of disease diagnosis and severity detection. For example, two sero-negative samples from the training cohort and six sero-negative samples were captured from the validation cohort increasing the sensitivity and specificity to 99% and 100% respectively. Furthermore, specific sequences were identified that allowed successful subgrouping according to severity, which is not possible by conventional antibodies.",

An advantage of this method includes the development of more precise diagnostic tests that can be incorporated into panels of testing for autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease. Moreover, the contribution of the individual amino acids of the antigen were evaluated for antibody binding, by designing microarrays of peptides containing lateral shifts of one amino acid, achieving higher mapping resolution for the target antigen.",

The methods described herein involve generalized de-protection followed by selective activation, providing two advantages: 1) a far higher fidelity of peptide synthesis, and 2) a greatly reduced time requirement for each step. This permits a significantly higher number of steps, as many as 400, in the synthesis of a peptide microarray, leading with a very low yield loss. In some embodiment, the combination of high-fidelity and shorter reaction times result in a much higher yield and the ability to generate a large number of chips. Additional advantages include the cost savings due to high-fidelity that may be required for diagnostic testing. The method described herein utilizes the state of the art 248 nm semiconductor lithography semiconductor tools on a proven 300 mm silicon wafer platform. In some embodiments, a very high microarray density enables not only the molecular diversity needed for biomarker discovery but also to enable large scale biomarker validation. The method is well suited for mass manufacturing for routine diagnostics since the chips size can scale down to 0.5\u00d70.5 mm2 fit any diagnostics well plate format, like 96, 384, 1396.
