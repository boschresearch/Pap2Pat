                        "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stress related disorder that may develop in survivors of a traumatic event, such as a military combat. PTSD is currently defined by the coexistence of four clusters of symptoms: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions and mood and arousal, persisting for at least one month. In addition, PTSD can cause intense fear, feeling of helplessness and anhedonia1. Fear and anxiety may increase over time, upon conditioning with stress-associated cues and in the absence of further stress exposure. Although cognitive behavioral therapy as well as pharmacotherapy with SSRIs, tricyclic anti-depressants2 and cognitive enhancers in combination with psychotherapy3 alleviate PTSD symptoms, there is no reliable curative treatment to date.",
                        "A dominant brain juncture that is related to motivation and hedonia (the ability to experience pleasure or reward) is the nucleus accumbens (NAc)4-6. Several studies reported alterations in NAc-related functions in PTSD patients, particularly reduced reward responsivity. A decreased NAc response to reward was demonstrated in individuals suffering from common stress-related psychopathologies, such as PTSD and depression7-9. A recent fMRI study probed the neural correlates of sensitivity to signals of risk and reward in 24 healthy soldiers at pre-exposure and post-exposure to stressful military service, demonstrating increased amygdala activation and decreased NAc activation in response to risky anticipation and rewarding outcome, respectively4-8, 10-14. Stress-induced, diminished NAc response to reward, combined with predisposed high amygdala responsivity to potential harm, may represent an underlying neural mechanism for vulnerability to stress psychopathology in humans. Neuroadaptations in the process of learning and memory have been suggested to explain the persistent distressing memories of a transient emotionally traumatic event. Since PTSD is characterized by a disordered memory, it most probably involves long-lasting changes in regulation of gene expression. This study tests the hypothesis that epigenetic alterations in the NAc play a critical role in linking traumatic exposure and presence (susceptibility) or absence (resilience) of PTSD-like behavior later in time.",
                        "Epigenetic mechanisms program the genome during cellular differentiation and embryonal development and enable a single genome to express multiple phenotypes in the different tissues that comprise a multicellular organism. Epigenetic mechanisms include covalent modification of the DNA molecule itself by methylation15 and hydroxymethylation16 as well as modifications of the histone proteins which are the building blocks around which DNA is tightly wrapped in chromatin17. DNA methylation is involved in memory formation in the adult hippocampus. For example, elevated expression of DNMT3A was implicated in memory formation in a model of reward-related associative memory18 and DNA methylation inhibitors 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and zebularine inhibited long term potentiation19. Fear conditioning was associated with changes in methylation of candidate genes involved in memory formation20. A double conditional knockout of dnmt3a and dnmt1 in adult neurons results in reduced DNA methylation and deficits in learning and memory without neuronal loss21. DNA methylation alterations in NAc were implicated in the reward responses to cocaine22. DNA methylation was recently examined in the NAc in an animal model of incubation of cocaine craving23 and it was demonstrated that broad changes in DNA methylation are involved in cocaine craving and that they could be reversed by epigenetic therapeutics. Several studies in humans demonstrated associations between PTSD and differential DNA methylation. Since brain is inaccessible in humans, most studies were conducted in peripheral WBC. Using a \u201cgenome wide\u201d approach Uddin et al., demonstrated association between PTSD and differentially methylated genes related to immune functions24. Mehta et al., showed DNA methylation alterations in PTSD victims that were also abused as children in comparison with either controls or PTSD victims with no childhood trauma25. Several candidate genes representing neurobiological pathways implicated in PTSD were shown to be associated with PTSD risk when differentially methylated; HPA axis (FKBP5, NR3C1), noradrenergic systems (COMT) and limbic frontal systems (SLC6A4)26. Interactions between risk alleles, DNA methylation and environment were demonstrated. FKBP5 risk allele is demethylated and associated with PTSD only in people who also suffered from child adversity, thus providing a molecular mechanism for gene environment interaction in PTSD27. SLC6A3-9 repeat allele is associated with PTSD risk only when it is methylated28.",
                        "A critical question that needs to be addressed is whether or not alterations in DNA methylation in response to trauma are triggered in the brain and whether or not they play a causal role in PTSD. Although risk factors for PTSD illness have been examined29 resilience in adults has often been neglected30. The idea that PTSD involves neuro-adaptations in the processes of learning and memory begs the question of whether resilience results from a process of protective neuro-adaptation rather than absence of neuro-maladaptation. An important question is therefore whether or not resilience is associated with a characteristic DNA methylation profile that is different from either control or susceptible individuals or whether resilience is characterized by absence of DNA methylation changes relative to control. In other words, does \u201cresilience\u201d reflect an active epigenetic process and a particular DNA methylation profile that plays a role in adapting the individual to PTSD? The present invention is founded on the idea that an analysis of the DNA methylation of PTSD resilient and susceptible rats in the brain will lead to critical pathways that should be targeted with therapeutics."

This model enables identification of animals that develop lasting symptoms which mimic the PTSD-like disorder after exposure to a traumatic experience. The animals are analyzed according to three clinically-relevant clusters of symptoms:\n\n\n- - 1. Manifestation of freezing behavior when situated alone in an open\n    field paradigm (re-experiencing).\n  - 2. Manifestation of freezing behavior when situated with a\n    habituated companion (social interaction).\n  - 3. Manifestation of freezing behavior after exposure to a\n    hyperarousal event.",
                        "Only animals that show abnormal score in all three clusters, one month from the exposure to the trauma, are identified as susceptible rats (PTSD-like). This animal model allows the arrival of the following discoveries. First, DNA methylation alterations in the NAc triggered by \u201cincubation of fear\u201d and associate with PTSD-like behavior were discovered. Second, a unique \u201cadaptive\u201d DNA methylation pattern that is different from controls and the PTSD animals was discovered in resilient animals. Third, DNA methylation modulators such as the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) reverse two of the three PTSD behaviors social interaction and re-experiencing and could therefore be used as a therapeutic for PTSD. Fourth, pathways that are enriched with genes that are differentially methylated in PTSD animals were discovered. Fifth, these pathways are used to identify new therapeutic targets for PTSD such as the retinoic acid or steroid antagonists and agonists. Sixth, retinoic acid reverses the hyperarousal behavior of PTSD. Seventh, a combination of retinoic acid (vitamin A) and SAM reverses all pathological behavior of PTSD animals and is therefore a new therapy for PTSD. The utility of the present invention is demonstrated that by analysis of the differentially methylated pathway, a novel combination of therapeutic agents SAM and retinoic acid (vitamin A) to treat PTSD is derived."

The rat (rn4) target probes were custom designed by utilizing H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 (indicating enhancers and promoters respectively) signals from mouse samples as there is no currently available ChIP data of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 with respect to the rat species. PuttivH3K4me1 and me3 were selected by mapping and aligning genomic fragments from mouse to the rat and retaining any fragments that share a high similarity and the subsequent associated signals. A total of 53374 target probes have been designed spanning 48072248 base pairs of sequence with a mean probe size of 900 bp. Biotinylated target probes were designed for both strands of bisulfite converted genomic DNA. Bisulfite treated genomic DNA is ligated to methylated NGS adaptors, hybridized to the biotinylated oligonucleotide probes which is followed by a series of washes of off-target DNA sequences and unbound DNA. The resulting isolated specific DNA then undergoes PCR amplification for downstream sequencing on Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencer. Capture and hybridization is performed as a service for fee by ICRM in Montreal licensed by Roche/Nimblegen. The following bioinformatics workflow is used in the lab. Quality control is done using FastQC to assess sequencing scores and other quality metrics. If necessary, trimming of raw file is performed using Trimmomatic to remove low scoring sequencing results and/or adapter contents. Sequences are aligned to rn4 rat reference genome using Bsmap v2.89. A typical alignment rate of 90%-95% is achieved (30\u00d7 coverage). The resulting sequencing alignment file (SAM) is converted to binary alignment format (BAM) for downstream analysis and filtering. BAM files are split, merged, and sorted by strand for additional downstream filtering and analysis. Duplicate reads within the BAM files are removed via Picard Tools (v1.93, BROAD institute) strand-specifically and the separate BAM files are merged back together and examined by Bamtools to assess whether the sequences are properly mapped to genome, whether both paired end reads exist (for paired end sequencing), and whether paired end reads are properly paired to each other (for paired end sequencing). Using the final BAM file, methylation ratios and coverage is recovered by provided scripts within Bsmap as well as methylation context. Annotation of genomic locations is performed by HOMER. Computation of differential methylation sites and tiled windows of differentially methylated regions was performed using a logistic regression method with the Methylkit R package in Bioconductor1.

NAcs were isolated from the animals (n=4-7 per group) following the third reminder and DNA and RNA were extracted as described in the methods. DNA was bisulfite converted, enriched using capture arrays for all predicted promoters and enhancers in the rat genome and was then subjected to next generation sequencing. The distribution of DNA methylation levels across the captured regions as described was first mapped. On average 5306667 CGs per animal was sequenced which showed an average coverage per CG of 39. The question of whether exposure to trauma triggered changes in the DNA methylation profile in the susceptible and the resilient groups was addressed by computing differential methylation sites using a logistic regression method with the Methylkit R package in Bioconductor1. First, the total CG methylation levels along the susceptible, resilient and control groups were compared. A significant methylation differences between the susceptible group to the resilient and control groups was revealed, on average the susceptible group is hypo-methylated in comparison with either the resilient or control groups (FIG. 2A) (One-way ANOVA: F[2, 9]=8.01; p<0.05; Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test: *p<0.01 and **p<0.001). Afterward the susceptible group (saline treated) and the control group (saline treated) were compared. The data demonstrates 263 CGs that were de-methylated and 211 CGS that were hyper-methylated at a threshold of delta>10\u2014and Q value of 0.2 (FIG. 2B). Resilience is characterized by absence of PTSD-like behavior on the long term (experiment day 35) in spite of similar exposure to the trauma and its reminder. The question of whether the resilient animals escaped the DNA methylation response to trauma and will exhibit no differences from control or whether a non-PTSD-like behavior evoked methylation alterations that might have been involved in a mechanism of adaptation was addressed. The DNA methylation state in resilient group (saline treated) with the control group (saline treated) was compared which revealed 275 CGs de-methylated and 306 CGs hyper-methylated at a threshold of >10; and Q value of 0.2 (FIG. 2B). Then, whether similar genes are affected in resilient and susceptible groups and whether the changes occur in the same or different directions was tested. Comparing the lists of differentially methylated CGs between the two groups that were exposed to the same \u2018incubation of fear\u2019 model, revealed that 136 CGs sites overlapped between the two groups (p=2.721E-272 FISCHER's EXACT two-tailed TEST). These mutual sites were in the same direction of methylation which raises the possibility that these CGs sites may represent the \u2018trauma sites\u2019, related to the traumatic exposure itself and not to the development of susceptibility or resilience (FIG. 2B-C). It is hypothesized that the remaining CG sites that were different between resilient and control groups represent the DNA methylation profile involved in resilience.",
                                "Hierarchical clustering by One minus Pearson correlation of the 738 (excluding the \u2018trauma sites\u2019) CGs sites that were altered in response to the \u2018incubation of fear\u2019 model in either the resilient or susceptible groups revealed that these sites cluster the resilient susceptible and control animals by their DNA methylation profile. (FIG. 2D). The data show that the incubation of the traumatic outcome elicits a DNA methylation alteration in all exposed animals, albeit differently in resilient and susceptible animals. Resilient animals' DNA methylation profile is different from both control and susceptible animals and although overall their behavior is normal, the associated DNA methylation is different. This is the first demonstration of a DNA methylation profile of \u201cresilience\u201d. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis of canonical pathways revealed that the differential methylated CGs that were changed in the resilient and susceptible groups have strong relevance to PTSD. Such pathways are: glucocorticoid signaling, corticotrophin releasing hormone signaling, serotonin and dopamine degradation, AMPG signaling, ERK/MAPK signaling, GDNF family ligand-receptor signaling, axonal guidance signaling, synaptic long term depression and potentiation, CREB signaling in neurons, Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP Signaling, cAMP-mediated signaling, protein kinase A signaling and more.",

More specifically, during the \u2018exploration\u2019 test in Re-3 time point (FIG. 3A), freezing behavior of susceptible-SAM treated rats was significantly decreased from freezing levels of susceptible-saline treated rats and no significant differences were observed between susceptible-SAM treated rats to the resilient and control treated with SAM or saline (one-way ANOVA: F[5, 27]=13.07; Bonferroni's post hoc: ***p<0.0001).

The fold change in freezing behavior in \u2018exploration\u2019 and \u2018social interaction\u2019 tests (from Re-2 to Re-3) between the susceptible-treated rats (FIG. 3D-G) indicates that SAM was effective in reducing these behaviors while it was ineffective in changing freezing behavior in the \u2018hyperarousal\u2019 test (from Re-2 to Re-3) (FIG. 3H-I).

For example, the Beta estradiol downstream pathway is upregulated (activated) in the susceptible group and downregulated (inhibited) in the resilient group and is also inhibited by SAMe's treatment (FIG. 6B), pointing to estradiol downregulation as a target for relieving PTSD-like symptoms. The involvement of estradiol responsive genes suggests also an important role for female sex hormones in determining susceptibility to PTSD34. Other up-regulators of differentially methylated genes are presented in the Heatmap. These pathways are relevant to anxiety and memory pathways such as: sex hormones, glucocorticoid and different cytokines.",

In the susceptible group there was an enrichment in downstream targets of the RAR-Related Orphan Receptor A (RORA), however the impact on level of activity of this pathway could not be derived from this analysis (FIG. 6B). Therefore, the levels of RORA mRNA expression in the different groups was first determined. RORA mRNA expression levels were higher in either control or resilient animals treated with either saline or SAM than in susceptible animals (*p<0.05, *p<0.05 and **p<0.01 respectively) (FIG. 6C), consistent with the possibility that this gene is involved in the pathology of PTSD. Interestingly, SAM had no effect on the level of expression of RORA. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the RORA pathway is involved in the hyperarousal behavior which is resistant to SAM's treatment and characteristic of the susceptible PTSD group. The correlation between the mRNA expression of RORA and the three behavioral tests was first measured; as hypothesized, only the hyperarousal behavior was correlated with the mRNA expression of RORA (FIG. 6D).

Each subpopulation of susceptible and resilient group received either SAM (25 mg/kg), retinoic acid (2 mg/kg) or saline (i.p., n=3-6 per group) twice, 24 h and 1 h before the third reminder (Re-3). It was found that the combination of SAMe and RA significantly attenuated freezing behavior in all of the three behavioral tests in the susceptible group in comparison with the groups that were not treated with this \u2018cocktail\u2019 (FIG. 7A-C). More specifically, during the \u2018exploration\u2019 test in Re-3 time point (FIG. 7A), freezing behavior of susceptible-SAM+RA and susceptible-SAMe treated animals was significantly decreased from freezing levels of susceptible-RA and susceptible-saline treated animals and no significant differences were observed between them and between the resilient treated animals with SAM, RA or saline (one-way ANOVA: F[7, 26]=11.81; Bonferroni's post hoc: *p<0.05, ***p<0.0001).

This is an attractive therapeutic strategy as both compounds are approved nutritional supplement. The results presented in FIG. 7 demonstrate that RA supplementation inhibits the hyperarousal phenotype of susceptible animals, but this effect is enhanced when RA is combined with SAM.

                        "Epigenetic mechanisms offer an attractive hypothesis for explaining the lasting effects of transient exposure to trauma as well as the potential impact of life adversity and gene environment interactions. However, evidence was lacking regarding DNA methylation alterations in brain regions known to be involved in PTSD and there was no evidence of a causal relationship between epigenetic alterations and PTSD behaviors. Addressing these questions is critical for understanding the disease as well as for prevention and intervention. These questions could only be addressed using a reliable animal model with construct validity. Previously, it was reported on such an animal model that mimics PTSD32. This model demonstrates a progressive increase in fear behavior and a shift to anxiety over time to the stress itself and to its reminders in the susceptible group (PTSD-like rats).",
                        "The findings show a time-dependent gradual intensification of fear response to recurring stress reminders over 35 days. The susceptible group's behavior corresponds with the clinical definition of PTSD in the human population, including anxiety behavior, social deficit and avoidance behavior and high levels of arousal behavior30,36. In addition, exogenous stressors, such as exposure to a live predator26,37, psychological stress37 and the predatory cue used in this research correspond with natural stressors. One of the salient characteristics of PTSD is resilience; the distribution of PTSD among trauma's victims is 5%-30%, whereas other that were exposed to the same trauma appear to be resilient to it27. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underpinning PTSD necessitates accounting for resilience and a model that has construct validity should exhibit partial resilience as well. This also highlights both importance of individual analysis of behavior and comparison of each exposed animal both with its own baseline and with the entire population. Although this analysis yields a lower percentage of susceptible rats, it more accurately simulates the heterogeneous pattern of response to stressful events in the human population. Thus, the combination of the model components, i.e., exogenous stimuli, simulation of clinical manifestation, and individual categorization, can produce more reliable results. Despite the increased risk that is associated with trauma, some individuals develop strong coping responses which defines them as a resilient group38, 39. The ability to cope adaptively with trauma refers to the resilient characteristic40. Resilience characteristics are likely to attenuate risks of developing PTSD, perhaps through effective emotional regulation, tolerance of negative affect, or active seeking of supportive or nurturing relationships41. Although detailed information is available on risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder29,42, resilience in adults has often been misunderstood because much of what is known about coping in trauma comes from studies of treatment seeking or distressed individuals recruited from psychiatric treatment settings43.",
                        "Since PTSD is characterized by a disordered memory44, understanding long-lasting changes in the programming of gene expression may help elucidate the factors that are involved in embedding the traumatic exposure in neural circuits well as the separation of susceptible from the resilient individuals. DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA that plays an important role in defining stable long lasting gene expression programs during differentiation2,3 and is also implicated in mediating the long term effects of early life adversity4. Moreover, DNA methylation varies between individuals even on the same genetic background and might provide an explanation for the inter-individual variation in the response to past traumas5. In the current discovery, the above mentioned model was used to examine at a single nucleotide resolution the known functional regulators of transcription in the rat genome, promoters 5\u2032UTR, 3\u2032UTR and enhancers using capture bisulfite sequencing. It was hypothesized that if changes in DNA methylation occur, they will not be limited to a small list of candidate genes but will involve several genes in functional gene pathways. Genes do not act independently but in complex networks and it stands to reason that complex behaviors involve alterations in complex neuronal circuits and in complex cellular pathways of gene expression. It also stands to reason that reversing a PTSD-like phenotype, for example, will be possible if pathways rather than single genes are targeted. Using an unbiased comprehensive approach provides an opportunity to characterize pathways that are affected in PTSD as well as those that confer resilience that could serve as new candidates for therapeutic interventions. The focus was on NAc since it is a central region in the limbic system known to mediate reward, motivation and hedonia4-6. As for PTSD, anhedonia is one of its main characteristics45, albeit less studied. Recent findings have demonstrated that the NAc may have a significant role in PTSD progress. Moreover, broad changes in DNA methylation occur in the NAc during incubation of cocaine craving supporting the hypothesis that DNA methylation might be also critical in incubation of fear in the NAc23.",
                        "First, it is shown that despite the risk to develop PTSD after a traumatic event in the animal model, the resilient rats are likely to attenuate the PTSD-like symptoms and are likely to assuage the expression of PTSD-like symptoms and exhibit behaviors similar to the control group, as in humans. This means that resilient rats are not unaffected subjects but rather individuals that develop resistance.",
                        "Second, it is shown that susceptible animals show differences in DNA methylation in the NAc as compared to control animals that involve, as hypothesized, a number of functional pathways such as neurological and psychological disorders, cellular function maintenance, anxiety, learning and memory and more. In total, 474 CG sites were differentially methylated from the control group in the susceptible group and they are associated with 379 different genes. These pathways serve as a platform for discovery of new drug targets to treat PTSD.",
                        "Third, it is shown that resilient animals also exhibit differentially methylated CG sites from control animals and these partially overlap with the susceptible DNA methylated differences. These changes occurred in the same direction of methylation (the \u201ctrauma sites\u201d), but the other methylated CG sites of the resilient group are unique to this group. Here, the first evidence that resilience is associated with an active DNA methylation response rather than absence of a change in DNA methylation is provided. This suggests that DNA methylation might be involved in resilience phenotype. In total 581 CGs were DNA methylated in the resilient group and they are included in 475 different genes. In addition, the resilient group exhibit DNA methylation differences from the control group which were enriched in a number of functional pathways such as nervous system development and function, psychological disorders, learning and memory, anxiety, cell-to-cell interaction signaling and more. It is tempting to speculate that trauma evokes a heterogeneous continuous DNA methylation response that is potentially protective but could become maladaptive when it fails to target the complete \u201cprotective\u201d DNA methylation program.",
                        "Examining the individual behavioral phenotypes of the animals in the study reveals that it shows a continuous inter-individual variation resembling a quantitative trait with a threshold rather than a binary trait. While classical genetics can easily explain binary traits caused by Mendelian inheritance of rare alleles, the continuous distribution of quantitative traits is more difficult to explain. The state of methylation of genes could vary from cell to cell even in the same tissue increasing the potential for a continuous variation. It is recently shown that quantitative distribution of DNA methylation in the epithelial growth factor receptor promoter (Egfr) is associated with quantitative distribution in body size in ants46. Quantitative distribution of DNA methylation is thus well poised to explain the quantitative inter-individual variations in the three behavioral traits that characterize PTSD. It is shown here that quantitative individual variations in each of the three behaviors exploration, social interaction and hyperarousal correlate with individual variation in 43 differential DNA methylated sites that were affected by SAM's treatment. Interestingly, two of the behaviors show an overlap in 9 differentially methylated CGs while hyperarousal seems to be controlled by an independent set of CGs. This is consistent with the fact that SAM's treatment does not affect hyperarousal nor does it change the state of methylation of sites that correlate with this behavior.",
                        "The data instructs first on the nature of changes in the DNA methylation landscape following \u2018incubation of fear\u2019 in NAc of resilient and susceptible animals as well as on the downstream pathways that are targeted by these processes. The wide cast of genes that are altered suggest that reversal of PTSD will probably require approaches that result in broad modulation of the DNA methylation agents and in modulating critical cellular pathways rather than single proteins or single targets of methylation. The ubiquitous methyl donor SAM was tested although it is clearly nonspecific for particular genes or group of genes and is involved in methylation of other macromolecules including histones. It was previously shown that SAM could cause broad but nevertheless selective alteration of DNA methylation in cancer cells6 as well as the brain7. SAM is particularly an attractive agent for PTSD since is an approved nutritional supplement with a known safety profile, thus positive results with this agent in animals could be translated into human studies. The data suggest that SAM's treatment modulates the DNA methylation profile of PTSD animals and is a candidate effective therapy to relieve two of the three characteristic pathological behaviors in PTSD in humans, exploration and social interaction.",
                        "If DNA methylation plays a causal role in PTSD, the differentially methylated genes, particularly those that exhibit correlation between levels of methylation and inter-individual differences in behavioral phenotypes are candidates for playing a role in the PTSD phenotypes susceptibility and resilience in the animals. The output of Capture bisulfite sequencing unravels candidate genes for intervention, which are likely to respond to either natural or synthetic chemicals (vitamins for example). Since the number of CG sites that were affected was large as is the case in many epigenetic studies (i.e. 7), whether they fall into particular functional groups was examined. It was reasoned that effective intervention should target pathways rather than particular genes that are differentially methylated. When the different upstream regulators of pathways enriched in differentially methylated genes in susceptible, resilient animals and reversed with SAM treatment were clustered, few significant networks of genes that have strong known relationship to PTSD, such as sex hormones, glucocorticoids, cytokines and others described in FIG. 6 were identified. One of the pathways that showed up as differentially altered in control, susceptible and resilient animals is the retinoic acid pathway. Interestingly RORA was previously identified in a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for PTSD47. As a proof of principle for this approach, the susceptible animals were treated with retinoic acid, a pathway revealed to be differentially methylated in susceptible animals, and the treatment was combined with SAM. Retinoic acid treatment reversed the hyperarousal behavior of PTSD animals. SAM reversed the other two behaviors, exploration and social interaction and the two treatments had synergistic effect on PTSD phenotypes. These experiments provide proof of principle for the hypothesis that DNA methylation alterations in PTSD target a wide cast of genes and therefore a combination of global modulators of either the DNA methylation machinery or pathways that are differentially methylated are a potentially new approach to understanding PTSD and treating it.",

                        "In reference to FIG. 6, \u201cA\u201d is coloring representing the p value of each group for the different \u201cupstream-regulator\u201d regulated pathways. Light blue represents low activation and dark blue represents high activation of the pathway. Grey represents pathways that didn't change. Yellow lines and boxes represent sex hormone dependent pathways, blue lines and boxes represent cytokine regulated pathways, pink lines and boxes represent glucocorticoids regulated pathways and green lines and boxes represent retinoic acid (vitamin A) regulated pathways. \u201cB\u201d is circular heat maps representing the different pathways that are influenced by a specific \u201cupstream-upregulator\u201d and are altered in PTSD susceptible and resistant animals. The upper circles represent the state of activity of beta-estradiol (or ESR-1 for SAM treated group) regulated genes in the susceptible group treated with saline relative to control, the resilient group treated with saline relative to control or the susceptible animals treated with SAM relative to susceptible animals treated with saline. The lowest circular heat map represents the state of activity of retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) regulated genes in the susceptible group treated with saline only relative to control. \u201cC\u201d is the RORA mRNA levels in the brain Nucleus accumbens region following the third reminder (Re3) (n=4-7 in each group) showing significant differences between the susceptible groups (treated with either saline or SAM) and the other groups. Bars represent mean+SEM. \u201cD\u201d is the correlations between mRNA expression levels of RORA to hyperarousal freezing levels (R=0.58, ***p=0.0004).",

Freezing behavior was assessed by exploration behavior in \u201cA\u201d, social interaction behavior in \u201cB\u201d, and hyperarousal behavior in \u201cC\u201d. The continuous grey line represents second reminder freezing levels of the susceptible group and the dotted grey line represents second reminder freezing levels of the resilient group. Bars represent freezing levels of the third reminder. A significant attenuation is observed in freezing behavior of susceptible group that was treated with SAM+RA and SAM versus susceptible group that was treated with saline in the third reminder. In the hyperarousal test only the SAM+RA was significantly attenuated (exploration: ***p<0.001, *p<0.05; social interaction: **p<0.01, *p<0.05; hyperarousal: **p<0.01).
