    "title": "A Seven-Marker Signature and Clinical Outcome in Malignant Melanoma: A Large-Scale Tissue-Microarray Study with Two Independent Patient Cohorts",
    "date": "2012-06-07",
    "abstract": "Current staging methods such as tumor thickness, ulceration and invasion of the sentinel node are known to be prognostic parameters in patients with malignant melanoma (MM). However, predictive molecular marker profiles for risk stratification and therapy optimization are not yet available for routine clinical assessment.Using tissue microarrays, we retrospectively analyzed samples from 364 patients with primary MM. We investigated a panel of 70 immunohistochemical (IHC) antibodies for cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA mismatch repair, differentiation, proliferation, cell adhesion, signaling and metabolism. A marker selection procedure based on univariate Cox regression and multiple testing correction was employed to correlate the IHC expression data with the clinical follow-up (overall and recurrence-free survival). The model was thoroughly evaluated with two different cross validation experiments, a permutation test and a multivariate Cox regression analysis. In addition, the predictive power of the identified marker signature was validated on a second independent external test cohort (n=225). A signature of seven biomarkers (Bax, Bcl-X, PTEN, COX-2, loss of \u03b2-Catenin, loss of MTAP, and presence of CD20 positive B-lymphocytes) was found to be an independent negative predictor for overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with MM. The seven-marker signature could also predict a high risk of disease recurrence in patients with localized primary MM stage pT1-2 (tumor thickness \u22642.00 mm). In particular, three of these markers (MTAP, COX-2, Bcl-X) were shown to offer direct therapeutic implications.The seven-marker signature might serve as a prognostic tool enabling physicians to selectively triage, at the time of diagnosis, the subset of high recurrence risk stage I-II patients for adjuvant therapy. Selective treatment of those patients that are more likely to develop distant metastatic disease could potentially lower the burden of untreatable metastatic melanoma and revolutionize the therapeutic management of MM.",

                "Cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM), represents the most common cause of death from skin cancer, and, apart from female lung cancer, it is the tumor entity with the highest increase in incidence worldwide [1]. MM is characterized by a multi-factorial etiology. Sun exposure and genetic susceptibility have been proposed as major etiological and predisposing factors and may explain the reported increase of incidence to some degree [2].",
                "De facto, the prognosis of patients with MM may only be conditionally derived from clinical and histological parameters. According to the AJCC 2009 classification [3], the findings of vertical tumor thickness [4], tumor ulceration [5], and sentinel node biopsy [6] represent the most dominant prognostic factors. In stage pT1 melanomas (\u22641.00 thickness), the mitotic rate (histologically defined as mitoses/mm2) has to be considered as additional prognostic parameter [3].",
                "In MM, multiple cellular factors are known to be deregulated in the initiation and progression phase of the tumor; among these are protein regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, signal transduction, cell adhesion and matrix digestion. A plethora of single biomarkers have been evaluated for outcome prediction in melanoma patients; e.g. Weinlich and coworkers identified metallothionein expression as an independent negative marker of melanoma progression in thin primary tumours [7]. Despite the fact that hundreds of such studies sought to assess the potential prognostic value of molecular markers in predicting the course of cutaneous MM, there are only two prognostic models with potential for translation into the clinic. Gould-Rothberg et al. [8] published a genetic-algorithm based five-marker solution, and Kashani-Sabet et al. [9] reported a three-marker model. However, no predictive molecular profiles for therapy optimization applicable for routine clinical assessment of MM are available, according to the latest review meta-analyses [10], [11].",
                "To this end, we examined the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of 70 candidate biomarkers of MM including regulating proteins of the cell cycle and apoptosis control, factors of signal-transduction, cell adhesion, transcription-factors, differentiation, and melanoma-specific antigens using tissue microarrays (TMAs). The study was based on extensive follow-up investigation of a total of 589 patients with primary MM from two independent cohorts, and was initiated to identify a clear set of reliable IHC markers for routine clinical assessment of patients with primary MM. Accordingly, this biomarker study aimed at identifying an independent prediction model for clinical outcome in patients with MM."

Specificity of commercial antibodies of the seven-marker signature has been thoroughly tested by immunoblotting (Figures S1), immunohistochemical analysis of melanocytes and melanoma cell lines using a cell pellet microarray (Figure S2), and immunostaining of whole melanoma sections (Figures S3A\u2013D). Nocito et al. [16] have already shown that intra-tumour heterogeneity does not significantly affect the ability to detect clinico-pathological correlations on tissue microarrays (TMAs), probably because of the large number of tumors that can be included in TMA studies. Figures S3A\u2013D show whole tissue sections of primary malignant melanomas stained for our seven-marker signature.

This semiquantitative scoring system was consistently used for all 70 markers analyzed. TMA spots with a lack of tumor tissue or presence of necrosis or crush artifact were excluded from the analysis. For the validation cohort (TMA 2), a single score was assigned, taking the strongest immunoreactivity of the two spots into account."

Exclusion of CD49d resulted in a final seven biomarker signature. Besides CD49d, Bcl-X, MTAP, and to a lesser extent CTNNB1 and Bax also displayed multiple bands (Figure S1).

Notably, the predictive power of the signature was carefully validated and confirmed on a secondary independent external test cohort (n\u200a=\u200a225). With a total of 27,055 specimens of primary MMs analyzed by IHC, this TMA study is unmatched in the literature. An individual patient\u2019s risk score can easily be calculated given the immunoreactivity scores for the seven markers and the estimated coefficients (Figure 5H). Figure 7 shows stained TMA specimens illustrating the Seven-Marker Signature for a patient with a high-risk and another patient with a low-risk melanoma.",
                "One of the main statistical problems in large scale IHC studies are missing values in the design matrix due to missing or corrupt spots on the TMA. The more markers are investigated the higher the chance that at least one value is missing per patient. Frequently this problem is tackled by either sacrificing a larger number of patient records or by employing volatile multiple imputation techniques. In this study 9.3% of values were missing, reducing the set of patients with all IHC measurements from 364 to 170. Algorithms like random survival forests [22] and ensemble learning with gradient boosting [23] are capable of dealing with missing values, but lead to models that are not intuitively interpretable and difficult to implement in clinical practice. To overcome these problems we employed a learning procedure which is invariant to missing values and results in an easily interpretable and practically applicable linear model.",
                "In early disease stages, application of an IHC based test to examine a MM patient\u2019s tumor tissue at a molecular level suggests itself. Even though melanoma was among the first cancers recognized as a target for practical application of microarray analysis starting in 1996 [24], the transition of gene expression results to diagnostic applications with clinical impact has not been shown yet in MM. Microarray studies produced a plethora of data and have provided useful insights into the molecular biology of melanoma (reviewed in [25]). However, analysis of different histological subtypes of melanoma, expression analysis of mainly melanoma metastases, and lack of homogeneity of patient cohorts hampered the interpretation of these data [25]. Furthermore, routine supply of fresh frozen MM tissue for microarray based assays seems virtually impossible. Also, use of RT-PCR based tests are complicated by the need for pure populations of neoplastic melanoma cells, and has not yet resulted in a breakthrough in melanoma diagnosis or management of melanoma patients. Our defined seven-marker signature was of independent prognostic relevance in two independent patient cohorts. For the practitioner, the assessment of this set of seven IHC markers promises to be a helpful tool to answer the crucial question \u201cwhom to treat, and how to treat\u201d, especially in the adjuvant setting after surgical excision of early-stage and localized primary MM (Stage I to IIa). With MTAP, COX-2 and Bcl-X, three markers of the seven-marker signature offer direct therapeutic implications, since the corresponding drugs have already been approved by the FDA.",
                "Currently, in the adjuvant treatment of MM, interferon alpha is the only clinically accepted therapeutic agent providing a significant (recurrence-free) survival benefit for a small but distinct percentage of patients [26]. On account of the serious side effects and the high costs of the therapy, only those patients with a realistic chance to benefit from interferon should receive this treatment. We have recently shown that there is a clear association between MTAP expression in the primary melanoma and melanoma progression and, even more importantly, response to interferon treatment [12], [27]. This gives rise to the hypothesis that interferon response may be correlated with the expression of interferon response genes such as MTAP.",
                "Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) may represent another promising therapeutic target. Cyclooxygenases catalyze the first rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. COX-2 is expressed in various tumor types and levels of COX-2 expression have been shown to correlate with invasiveness and prognosis in some tumor entities, including epithelial and melanocytic skin cancer [15], [28]. So far the benefit of COX-2-inhibitors has not been studied in the adjuvant treatment of early-stage melanomas to prevent metastasis. In the second-line treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma disease, however, a survival benefit was shown for targeted combined therapy using COX-2 inhibitors and PPARG-agonists for anti-inflammatory treatment together with low-dose metronomic chemotherapy [29]. Considering this observation and the fact that melanoma patients with COX-2-positive primary tumors bear a significantly higher risk of tumor recurrence [15], introduction of COX-2 inhibitors for primary adjuvant treatment of these patients seems obvious.",
                "One additional marker, Bcl-X, has been targeted in preclinical tests and several targeting agents are in the clinical testing phase by now [30]: Bcl-X is related to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family. Overexpression of these anti-apoptotic proteins protects cancer cells against death signals of apoptosis. Interestingly, tumors expressing high levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X are often found to be resistant to chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy [31]. In recent years, non-peptidic cell permeable \u201csmall molecule inhibitors\u201d (SMIs) against antiapoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 or Bcl-X have been identified. SMIs inhibit distinct protein-protein interactions by blocking specific binding sites of the target molecule, thus supporting the apoptotic machinery [30]. Inhibition of Bcl-X may exert a synergistic effect with conventional treatments like chemo- or radiation therapy. Regarding MM therapy, this effect would be a decisive therapeutic success.",
                "Presence of CD20-positive B-lymphocytes within or adjacent to MM tissue (Figures 8A\u2013D ) was among the top seven biomarkers. However, the role of B-lymphocyte infiltration in MM is unknown and needs further investigation. The CD20-antigen is known to be an effective therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with CD20-positive B-Cell-Non-Hodgkin-Lymphomas. The monoclonal chimeric antibody Rituximab is indicated for alternative immunotherapy [32]. In MM, several subpopulations - some with stem cell-like characteristics - have been described including one with expression of CD20 (reviewed in [33]). In our study, only very few cases showed infiltrating CD20 positive B-lymphocytes (Figure 2E), comprising a very narrow dynamic range of this marker. However, even a six-marker signature without CD20 was significantly associated with overall and recurrence-free survival (Figures 9A and 9B).",
                "The tumor-suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most commonly inactivated genes in human cancer and has been identified as lost or mutated in melanoma [34]. An established consequence of PTEN inactivation is the constitutive aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathway that drives uncontrolled cell growth, proliferation, and survival [35]. In general, prediction of PI3K-signaling pathway activation based on PTEN IHC expression status is unfeasible since inactivation of PTEN is achieved by either gene mutation or deletion [34]. Figure S5 shows that some melanoma cell lines show PTEN expression and concomitant activation of the PI3K/AKT cascade. Alterations of the tumor suppressor PTEN have already been linked with disease outcome in patients with MM: Mikhail et al. have shown that loss of nuclear PTEN expression was associated with aggressive tumor behavior [36]. In contrast, we could show that strong cytoplasmic PTEN expression was found only in high risk patients.",
                "Most oncological findings regarding the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling are derived from the analysis of colon, breast and kidney carcinoma [37], [38] where activation of the pathway has been directly implicated in disease pathogenesis. The majority of colorectal carcinomas carry inactivating mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor which lead to stabilization of \u03b2-Catenin, mimicking Wnt stimulation. Additionally, mutations in the \u03b2-Catenin gene CTNNB1 were found in colon cancer leading to the constitutive activation of \u03b2-Catenin/LEF/TCF-dependent canonical signaling [39]. However, such mutations are rarely found during melanoma development. In contrast to findings in colon carcinoma and in line with a study by Kuphal et al. [40], we show that \u03b2-Catenin protein was basically cytoplasmic in melanomas in vivo. Regarding our risk score, loss of cytoplamic \u03b2-Catenin expression was associated with worse outcome of melanoma patients. Kuphal and co-workers also demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of \u03b2-Catenin regulating expression of \u03b2-Catenin target genes was not observed in several melanoma cell lines, suggesting a cell type specific regulation of \u03b2-Catenin function [40].",
                "According to the data presented here, the seven-marker signature might serve as a prognostic tool enabling physicians to selectively triage, at the time of diagnosis and initial surgery, the subset of high recurrence risk stage I\u2013II patients for adjuvant therapy. Selective treatment of those patients that are more likely to develop distant metastatic disease could potentially lower the burden of untreatable metastatic melanoma and revolutionize the therapeutic management of MM. Prospective clinical trials are necessary to validate the prognostic and therapeutic value of this seven-marker signature and its benefit for routine clinical assessment of MM. The utility of the algorithm in a practice setting, where full heterogeneous tissue sections are used, is currently being analyzed in a prospective clinical trial at the Department of Dermatology, University of Regensburg, Germany."
