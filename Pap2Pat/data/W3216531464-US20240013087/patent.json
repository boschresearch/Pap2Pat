The error mitigation strategy is capable of reducing the impact of stochastic errors arising from noise, e.g., on a near-term device, as well as stochastic errors inherent to randomized quantum algorithms implemented on an error-free device.

                        "This specification describes techniques for mitigating errors in a noisy quantum computation. In particular, the presently described techniques enable an efficient approximation of a computational output that would be produced in the absence of noise. Expectation values of an observable with respect to an approximately purified version of a noisy quantum state are reconstructed without explicitly preparing the purified quantum state. This approach is referred to herein as \u201cvirtual distillation,\u201d where the word \u201cvirtual\u201d is used to emphasize that the purified version of the quantum state is not actually prepared (as in conventional distillation schemes.) More specifically, collective measurements of M copies of the noisy quantum state \u03c1 are used to measure expectation values of an observable with respect to an entangled quantum state represented as:",

Under this approach, the relative weights \u03c1iM of the non-dominant eigenvectors are suppressed exponentially in M. This represents an improvement over other approaches that demand that the approximately purified state is prepared explicitly, which achieve a suppression that is only linear in M in the general case. Accordingly, virtual distillation approximates a corrected expectation value (e.g., an expectation value where incoherent errors have been suppressed) of the observable O as a trace of a product of the observable and M copies of the spectral decomposition of the noisy quantum state, divided by a trace of M copies of the spectral decomposition of the noisy quantum state, e.g.",

                        "The resulting estimator converges exponentially quickly towards the closest pure state to \u03c1 as M is increased. This is in contrast to other approaches that only achieve a linear convergence to a corrected state. The presently described techniques therefore provide a technical improvement over these other approaches, since the corrected state can be obtained in less time.",
                        "In this specification the operations described are operations that act on multiple copies of the same noisy state. It is assumed that the noise experienced by the separate copies has the same form and strength. If this assumption is relaxed, then an effective state that corresponds to the product of the density matrices of the individual copies is still measured so long as the copies are not entangled prior to virtual distillation. The letter N indicates the number of qubits in an individual system and the letter M indicates the number of copies (which is sometimes referred to as subsystems). Superscripts with parentheses indicate an operator that acts on multiple systems. For example, the cyclic shift operator between M copies is denoted by S(M). Bolded superscripts without parentheses denote which copy an operator/observable acts on, e.g., O1 indicates the observable O acting on subsystem 1. Superscripts without a bold-faced font or parentheses indicate exponentiation as usual. Subscripts on an operator generally indicate which qubit within a system the operator acts on. The exception is when the subscript is being used more generically as an index in a summation, which to the skilled person will be clear from the context and the presence of the X symbol."

A quantum computing system 102 obtains multiple copies of a noisy quantum state 104. For example, the quantum computing system 102 can include a quantum computer that is performing a quantum computation. Part of the quantum computation can include measuring an output quantum state to determine properties of the quantum state, e.g., an expectation value of a target observable, and obtain a result of the quantum computation. In the absence of noise, the output quantum state would be error-free. Therefore, an error-free expectation value could be obtained through repeated preparation and measurement of the output quantum state. However, realistically the quantum computation performed by the quantum computer is likely to be a noisy quantum computation, e.g., in cases where the quantum computer is a NISQ device. Therefore, the output quantum state is typically a noisy quantum state and an expectation value obtained through repeated preparation and measurement of the output quantum state will be noisy. The quantum computer must therefore correct the expectation value in order to obtain a more accurate and meaningful result of the quantum computation.",

Generally, the quantum circuits 108 can vary depending on various factors such as the number of copies of the noisy state included in the tensor product 106, the type of target observable, e.g., whether the target observable is a single qubit operator or multi-qubit operator, and whether additional quantum computing resources are available to the quantum computer, e.g., whether ancilla-assisted measurement is feasible in the experimental setup. Variants of virtual distillation are described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 5.",

In some implementations the quantum computing device 202 is a noisy quantum computing device, e.g., a NISQ device. The components shown here, their connections and relationships, and their functions, are exemplary only, and do not limit implementations of the inventions described and/or claimed in this specification.",

The qubit assembly 252 also includes adjustable coupling elements, e.g., coupler 208, that allow for interactions between coupled qubits. In the schematic depiction of FIG. 2, each qubit is adjustably coupled to each of its four adjacent qubits by means of respective coupling elements.

Applying a unitary operator to a quantum state can include applying a corresponding sequence of quantum logic gates to the qubits. Example quantum logic gates include single-qubit gates, e.g., Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z (also referred to as X, Y, Z), Hadamard and S gates, two-qubit gates, e.g., SWAP gates, controlled-X, controlled-Y, controlled-Z (also referred to as CX, CY, CZ), and gates involving three or more qubits, e.g., Toffoli gates.

Example operating frequencies include qubit idling frequencies, qubit interaction frequencies, and qubit readout frequencies. Different frequencies correspond to different operations that the qubit can perform. For example, setting the operating frequency to a corresponding idling frequency may put the qubit into a state where it does not strongly interact with other qubits, and where it may be used to perform single-qubit gates. As another example, in cases where qubits interact via couplers with fixed coupling, qubits can be configured to interact with one another by setting their respective operating frequencies at some gate-dependent frequency detuning from their common interaction frequency. In other cases, e.g., when the qubits interact via tuneable couplers, qubits can be configured to interact with one another by setting the parameters of their respective couplers to enable interactions between the qubits and then by setting the qubit's respective operating frequencies at some gate-dependent frequency detuning from their common interaction frequency.

                                "Under the assumption that the target observable can be symmetrized, as described above with reference to example process 400, the system can then measure the product O(2)S(2) by measuring the qubits in the two registers with respect to the target observable O(2) to obtain respective second measurement outcomes. The system can then use the first measurement outcomes and the second measurement outcomes from the different measurement repetitions to compute the error-mitigated expectation value of the target observable with respect to the noisy quantum state. In particular, the system can compute an expectation value of the target observable using the second measurement outcomes, compute an expectation value of the cyclic shift operator using the first measurement outcomes, and divide the expectation value of the target observable by the expectation value of the cyclic shift operator.",

Furthermore, measurements of O on both copies of \u03c1 can be used and the numerator and denominator of Equation (8) can be estimated simultaneously, leading to a relatively sample-efficient scheme.",
                                "For virtual distillation with ancilla-assisted measurement on M>2 copies of the noisy quantum state, S(N) is not Hermitian for N>2. However the natural generalization to the above strategy still works as expected. Specifically, a controlled version of the cyclic shift operator S(N) can be used to sample an observable whose expectation value is equal to Re (Tr(S(N)\u03c1\u2297N)). Because the symmetrized observable O(N) commutes with S(N), it also commutes with the observable measured by this generalization of the swap test. Therefore, an observable whose expectation value is Tr(S(N)O(N)\u03c1\u00aeN) can be sampled from by first performing the higher-order swap test and then a measurement of O(N)."

                                "Most error mitigation methods focus on the reduction of errors caused by imperfections in a device implementation, such as decoherence or control errors. Some of these techniques can be applied to algorithmic errors incurred during otherwise noise-free implementations of randomized algorithms. Developments in Hamiltonian simulation have led to the development of randomized evolution methods such as qDRIFT, randomized Trotter, and combinations thereof, which have benefits in some situations over their deterministic counterparts. As these methods are randomized, they output mixed states rather than pure states, even in the absence of noise. Moreover, they depend on an approximation parameter with a natural limit in which they converge to the pure state generated by exact evolution. As described below, virtual distillation applied to qDRIFT can suppress this deviation from the exact evolution. For the particular model system considered below, it is found that virtual distillation can reduce the coherent space-time volume required to reach a particular accuracy threshold by a factor of 8 or more compared with the standard qDRIFT.",
                                "The qDRIFT method simulates time evolution under a Hamiltonian H by constructing product formulae using a randomized selection rule. Terms are chosen from H at random, with a selection probability proportional to their interaction strength in the Hamiltonian. The system is then evolved forwards in time under this Hamiltonian term, for a fixed time step. This process is repeated a number of times, generating a product formula that provides an approximation to the time evolution operator. When averaged over the classical randomness (in the choice of interaction terms), qDRIFT generates a quantum channel that closely approximates the exact evolution more closely than the individual product formulae. Importantly, unlike most deterministic Trotter methods, the scaling of this approach does not depend explicitly on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, but rather than 1-norm of the coefficients.",
                                "Consider a Hamiltonian that can be decomposed as H=\u03a3ihiHi, where all hi are can be made real and positive by absorbing signs into Hi, and the spectral norm of Hi is bounded by 1. Defining \u03bb=\u03a3ihi the diamond norm distance between the qDRIFT channel and the true time evolution is bounded by \u03f5=2\u03bb2t2/\u03b7 where \u03b7 is the number of qDRIFT selection steps performed to generate each instance of the qDRIFT channel, and hence controls the amount of coherent evolution required. As \u03b7 increases, the resulting quantum channel converges to the unitary corresponding to the exact evolution.",
                                "The presently described virtual distillation technique can reduce the coherent space-time volume required, by reducing this factor 7 required to achieve the same error in practice. In particular, virtual distillation can impact the number of coherent steps, \u03b7, required to reach a target accuracy. For this, a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with up to 6 qubits per copy is considered. The Hamiltonian is given by",

For the presently described studies a time evolution length of t=N is considered and let h=1. The number of coherent qDRIFT steps required to achieve a trace distance of 0:01 to the ideal state for evolutions under such a Heisenberg model are numerically investigated.",
                                "FIG. 7 shows results of this analysis. In particular, FIG. 7 shows qDRIFT coherent cost reduction through virtual distillation in the Heisenberg model. The number of coherent qDRIFT steps required to reach a target trace distance, with and without virtual distillation using 2 copies, is shown. It can be seen that there is a consistent reduction of at least 16\u00d7 in the number of required steps. When accounting for the over-head of using two copies, this amounts to a 8\u00d7 reduction in the coherent space-time volume used to reach the same error rate. These results show that the use of the presently described error mitigation techniques can provide practical algorithmic improvements for real systems, especially in the NISQ regime. For example, by incorporating the presently described error mitigation techniques algorithms can produce more accurate results with reduced overhead, e.g., the overhead associated with quantum error correction codes.",
