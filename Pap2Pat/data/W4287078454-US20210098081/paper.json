    "title": "Trellis BMA: Coded Trace Reconstruction on IDS Channels for DNA Storage",
    "date": "2021-07-13",
    "abstract": "Sequencing a DNA strand, as part of the read process in DNA storage, produces multiple noisy copies which can be combined to produce better estimates of the original strand; this is called trace reconstruction. One can reduce the error rate further by introducing redundancy in the write sequence and this is called coded trace reconstruction. In this paper, we model the DNA storage channel as an insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channel and design both encoding schemes and low-complexity decoding algorithms for coded trace reconstruction. We introduce Trellis BMA, a new reconstruction algorithm whose complexity is linear in the number of traces, and compare its performance to previous algorithms. Our results show that it reduces the error rate on both simulated and experimental data. The performance comparisons in this paper are based on a new dataset of traces that will be publicly released with the paper. Our hope is that this dataset will enable research progress by allowing objective comparisons between candidate algorithms.",

                "DNA storage is an exciting area because of its potential to provide both high information density and long-term stability [1]. To achieve a good trade-off between efficiency and reliability, DNA storage systems use error-correcting codes [2]- [9]. This paper considers the design and decoding of errorcorrection codes for the DNA storage channel (see Figure 1).",
                "In this paper, the DNA storage channel is modeled as an insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channel and we focus on the case where a single encoded message is transmitted and multiple independent traces are observed [2]- [4], [7]. Sequence reconstruction methods for this problem date back to the 1980s [10]. This is closely related to the trace reconstruction problem in CS literature which asks how many traces (from a deletion channel) are needed to perfectly reconstruct the input message sequence, in the average or worst case. Many algorithms exist for trace reconstruction [11]- [17], a few of which (such as Bitwise Majority Alignment (BMA) [12]) can be modified for the IDS channel and have been used in DNA data storage systems [18], [19].",
                "In practical systems, outer codes are used to code across multiple DNA strands in order to recover missing sequences and correct substitutions of individual symbols. Thus, we focus primarily on approximate reconstruction, as opposed to exact reconstruction. For IDS-like channels, one can compute exact posterior marginals by combining ideas from multiplesequence alignment [10] and the BCJR algorithm [20] (e.g., see [21]- [23]). Using these posterior marginals, it is easy to compute estimates that minimize additive distortion measures.",
                "If the outer code uses hard-decision decoding, then a reasonable goal is to construct a practical estimator that, given a small number of traces, minimizes the expected Hamming distance to the input message. Strands may also use an inner code that is designed to provide additional protection [24], [25]. The inner code constraints can also be included in channel trellis [26] so that trellis-based methods can still be used for inference. In particular, for convolutional codes, it is possible to build a multidimensional trellis and perform symbolwise maximuma-posteriori (MAP) reconstruction, as observed in [23]. But, the complexity grows exponentially with the number of traces making exact inference infeasible."

This is different from the approaches in [23], [27], [28] because each singletrace trellis decoder is influenced by the other decoders but it is related to the factor graph method in [22].

Even if we ignore the first two elements, the exact error profile of the noisy observations is dependent on the DNA sequencing technology used. However, exactly modeling this error profile is tedious and often impractical. Moreover, DNA sequencing technologies are evolving at a rapid pace and  Encoded DNA strands are read or \"sequenced\" using a sequencing technology, such as Illumina/Nanopore sequencers, and this outputs many noisy copies of the DNA sequence, from which the message vector in the data strand is recovered.",
                                "focusing on a particular error profile does not provide a futureproof approach to the problem. Instead, one typically considers a simplistic approximation and models the sequencing channel as an IDS channel (defined in the next subsection). Our ideas also extend naturally to more complex approximations for the channel model. For instance, insertions and deletions often occur in \"bursts\" and such events can be captured by a firstorder Markov model; our decoder can easily be modified to accommodate for such variations. Due to the difficulty of synthesizing and sequencing long DNA strands, DNA storage systems typically encode a single file into many different short strands. The Poisson nature of sampling short strands from the pool means that many of these strands will not be sequenced. Thus, an outer code is required and sequence numbers must be included for disambiguation [30]. This detail is sometimes neglected in simulation-based experiments (e.g., it seems a single long strand is used in [23])."

Analogously, we start from the end of the trellis and update the backward values to compute an estimate U L/2+1 U 2 ... U L which proceeds in the reverse order.

Note that BMALA is a TR algorithm and does not give soft output. Hence, the BMALA-HD curve in Fig. 2(d) maps the harddecision symbol error rate into an achievable rate. We note that BMALA-HD beats Trellis BMA for more than 6 traces even though Trellis BMA has a lower error rate. This is because the soft outputs of Trellis BMA are not ideally calibrated. In future work, we will investigate learning-based methods to see if they can generate better calibrated output probabilities.",

We also report the numbers for the multi-trace trellis only for TR with 3 or fewer; other experiments with the multi-trace trellis are computationally infeasible. Training is used to learn the IDS channel (p ins , p del , p sub ), validation is used to tune the hyperparameters (\u03b2 e , \u03b2 o , etc.) for Trellis BMA, and the test set is used for the reported results. We remark that multiply posteriors is an instance of Trellis BMA when \u03b2 b = \u03b2 o = 1 and \u03b2 e = \u03b2 i = 0. Now, wee briefly describe the steps in the Improved BMALA algorithm, which attempts to sequentially estimate each symbol of the DNA sequene X. For each of the traces, it uses a hard estimate of the input pointer and then estimates the next symbol of X using a vote of the current symbols implied by the hard input-pointer estimates. For the traces that do not agree with the plurality, it tries to infer the reason for disagreement (e.g., insertion, deletion, or substitution) by looking ahead a few symbols, and moves the corresponding pointers accordingly. If the algorithm cannot decide on any reason for disagreement, it discards the trace temporarily and attempts to brings it back at a later point in time."
