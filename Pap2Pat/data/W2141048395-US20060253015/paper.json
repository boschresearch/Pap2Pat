    "title": "B1-insensitiveT2 preparation for improved coronary magnetic resonance angiography at 3 T",
    "date": "2006-01-01",
    "abstract": "At 3 T, the effective wavelength of the RF field is comparable to the dimension of the human body, resulting in B1 standing wave effects and extra variations in phase. This effect is accompanied by an increase in B0 field inhomogeneity compared to 1.5 T. This combination results in nonuniform magnetization preparation by the composite MLEV weighted T2 preparation (T2 Prep) sequence used for coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). A new adiabatic refocusing T2 Prep sequence is presented in which the magnetization is tipped into the transverse plane with a hard RF pulse and refocused using a pair of adiabatic fast-passage RF pulses. The isochromats are subsequently returned to the longitudinal axis using a hard RF pulse. Numerical simulations predict an excellent suppression of artifacts originating from B1 inhomogeneity while achieving good contrast enhancement between coronary arteries and surrounding tissue. This was confirmed by an in vivo study, in which coronary MR angiograms were obtained without a T2 Prep, with an MLEV weighted T2 Prep and the proposed adiabatic T2 Prep. Improved quantitative and qualitative coronary MRA image measurement was achieved using the adiabatic T2 Prep at 3 T.",

                        "The T 2 Prep sequence as proposed by Brittain et al. (13) was modified to minimize adverse effects of B 1 and B 0 field inhomogeneities at higher magnetic field strength. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the T 2 Prep sequence. The isochromats experience a 90\u00b0pulse followed by train of refocusing pulses. The refocusing pulses are weighted in a MLEV opposing phase pairs scheme (19,20) to compensate for RF pulse shape imperfections. Composite refocusing pulses (90\u00b0x, 180\u00b0y, 90\u00b0x) were suggested to provide second-order corrections to variations in B 1 . A large spoiling gradient was used after the return of the magnetization to its equilibrium to dephase residual transverse magnetization. The degree of insensitivity of this type of T 2 Prep sequence to field inhomogeneities depends on the number of the MLEV pulses, with a better response being achieved by using a larger number of pulses (20). However, increasing the number of MLEV weighted composite pulses results in an increase in SAR, precluding the use of a sufficient number of pulses necessary to achieve the desired B 0 and B 1 insensitivity at high magnetic field strength.",
                        "Adiabatic RF pulses, characterized by the simultaneous modulation of the RF amplitude and frequency (or phase), are insensitive to B 1 and B 0 field inhomogeneities (21)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28). Adiabatic pulses operate under the classic adiabatic passage principle, which states that the magnetization vectors parallel and anti-parallel to the effective B 1 field stay parallel and anti-parallel, respectively, while magnetization vectors perpendicular to B 1 will precess and remain perpendicular to the field. There are a variety of adiabatic modulation functions that satisfy the adiabacity condition such as sin/cos, tan/sec, sech/tanh (29), and numerically optimized modulations (26). One of the most commonly used adiabatic pulses is the Silver-Hoult (hyperbolic secant) (21) pulse in which the RF amplitude, B 1 (t), and frequency \u232c(t) can be expressed as",
                        "in which \u2424 is a dimensionless truncation factor, typically set to sech \u03ea1 (0.01) (21), t is time, T is total duration of the pulse, and B 1max and \u232c max are the maximum amplitude and frequency modulation, respectively. B 1max and \u232c max are determined by bandwidth, SAR deposition, RF amplifier constraints, and adiabacity conditions. Adiabatic fast passage (AFP) and adiabatic half-passage RF pulses are commonly used for in vivo NMR to induce B 1 insensitive spin inversion and excitation. These pulses cannot generate plane rotation, in which the magnetization is rotated about an axis. Conolly et al. (22) proposed a low power adiabatic refocusing method in which the echo could be generated by any pair of identical AFP pulses. Using this technique, the second AFP RF pulse fully compensates for the phase variations generated by the first AFP pulse. In this study, we exploit such a pair of adiabatic pulses to achieve a plane rotation in the T 2 Prep."

                        "In order to suppress the imaging artifacts associated with MLEV weighted composite T 2 Prep in coronary MRA at 3 T, we propose a novel adiabatic T 2 Prep. Figure 2 shows a schematic of amplitude (Fig. 2a) and frequency modulations (Fig. 2b) of such an adiabatic T 2 Prep. During this sequence, the longitudinal magnetization (M z ) is rotated into the transverse plane using a hard RF pulse. The magnetization decays as a function of the relaxation terms of T 1 and T 2 and precesses for total of TE/4 before experiencing the second RF pulse, an AFP pulse that results in an inversion of spins. However, only the spins in parallel with or anti-parallel to the effective B 1 will experience an inversion while the perpendicular spins precess and remain in a plane normal to the effective B 1 field. The transverse magnetization dephases during the AFP pulse and the refocused magnetization at TE/2 will have an extra phase at t \u03ed TE/2. The accumulated phase is determined by the duration T of the adiabatic pulse and the effective B 1 field B eff (t) during the pulse:",
                        "This phase dispersion results in a signal loss if the magnetization is returned to the longitudinal axis. However, this can be compensated for by using an additional adiabatic inversion pulse. This pulse is applied TE/2 after the first adiabatic inversion pulse to accomplish a plane rotation. Subsequently, the isochromats return to the longitudinal direction using a tip-up hard-RF pulse (\u03ea90\u00b0x) TE/4 after the second adiabatic pulse. A spoiling gradient is used to dephase all the remaining transverse isochromats (not shown in Fig. 2). Numerical simulations of the Bloch equations [30] were performed to calculate the normalized longitudinal magnetization (M z /M eq ) as a function of offresonance and B 1 field variations for both the nonadiabatic and the adiabatic T 2 Prep. The MLEV weighted composite T 2 Prep sequence (Fig. 1) has duration of TE \u03ed 50 ms, and the simulation was performed for two and four composite refocusing pulses. The RF pulse in the simulation was a rectangular hard pulse with duration of 0.43 and 0.96 ms for a 90 \u00b0and 180 \u00b0, respectively, with maximum bandwidth. Similar numerical simulations were performed for the adiabatic T 2 Prep sequence shown in Fig. 2 with duration of TE \u03ed 50 ms. The hard RF pulses, similar to one used in the MLEV weighted sequence, were used excitation and tip-up pulses. Adiabatic sech/tanh inversion pulses with a bandwidth of 1 kHz and a duration of 11.2 ms were used. For all simulations, T 1 and T 2 for arterial blood were 1650 and 100 ms, for venous blood 1575 and 20 ms, and for myocardium 1114 and 55 ms, respectively. All simulations were performed in Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). A scout scan was acquired for localization and navigator positioning using a gradient echo imaging sequence (18,32). Subsequently, a 3D low-resolution, navigatorgated scan for localization of the coronaries was acquired during free breathing. A 2D-selective RF pulse with 12 revolutions in k-space and a beam radius of 15 mm was used for gating and tracking of respiratory motion (32). The navigator beam was positioned at the dome of the right hemidiaphragm with an acceptance window of 5 mm and RF excitation angle of 30\u00b0 (34). After the 3D scout scan, an ECG-triggered, segmented steady-state free precession cine images (TR \u03ed 3.8 ms, TE \u03ed 1.8 ms, \u2423 \u03ed 45\u00b0, and temporal resolution of 39.6 ms) at the level of the proximal-to-mid right coronary artery (RCA) for visual determination of the most quiescent period was added (33). Subsequently, coronary MRA was performed. A schematic of the coronary MRA sequence is shown in Fig. 3 Image analysis was performed on a stand-alone PC, where images were multiplanar reconstructed using the \"Soapbubble\" tool (35). Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and SNR were quantified for each dataset using the original, nonreformatted images. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected in the proximal right coronary artery for the measurement of the mean blood signal (S blood ) and SD ( blood ). The mean muscle signal (S muscle ) and its SD ( muscle ) were obtained from an ROI in the ventricular septum. SNR and CNR were calculated as follows:",

In addition to the quantitative analysis, qualitative visual grading of the images was performed on a consensus reading by three of the authors (R.N., M.Y.D., and M.S.) blinded to the acquisition method. Each 3D data set was graded based on observation of any B 1 inhomogeneity artifacts. The image was assigned a grade as follows:",

                "Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the longitudinal magnetization, M z /M eq , calculated from the numerical simulation of the Bloch equations for arterial and venous blood and for the myocardium for two and four MLEV weighted composite refocusing pulses. The colormap in the image corresponds to the normalized longitudinal magnetization after the T 2 Prep sequence as a function of off-resonance (x axis) and normalized B 1 amplitude (y axis). The B 1 amplitude was normalized to that required to achieve a 90\u00b0e xcitation. In an ideal field with no inhomogeneity, the magnetization should return to the equilibrium state (red color) with a loss in magnitude only due to relaxation terms. However, in the presence of inhomogeneity, the isochromats will experience additional gradients that induce more variable longitudinal magnetization after the T 2 Prep. These results demonstrate that the magnetization does not consistently and fully return to its equilibrium in the presence of strong B 1 inhomogeneity. The myocardium appears to be more sensitive to the field inhomogeneities compared to the arterial blood as seen in Figs. 4a andc and 5a and c. Note that there are regions where magnetization is almost inverted after the preparation sequence (blue shading in Figs. 4 and5). The comparison between the results shown in Figs. 4 and5 shows an improvement of the sequence response with respect to field inhomogeneity by increasing the number of refocusing pulses.",
                "Results from the simulation of M z /M eq for the proposed adiabatic T 2 Prep are shown in Fig. 6. The results suggest that compared to the MLEV weighted composite T 2 Prep, there is less sensitivity to field inhomogeneities. Therefore, the magnetization returns to its equilibrium more uniformly in the presence of field inhomogeneity at 3 T.",
                "Sample reformatted images of the RCA of a normal volunteer are shown in Fig. 7. The coronary MRA image in Fig. 7a was acquired without any T 2 magnetization preparation sequence. The image shows no B 1 inhomogeneity artifacts. However, there is no or minor contrast between coronary arteries and the surrounding tissue. Figure 7b shows the same image acquired with the T 2 Prep sequence that includes two MLEV weighted composite refocusing pulses. The result shows an enhancement of the contrast between coronary arteries and the surrounding tissue. However, an enhanced artifact level is also visible in the liver, the myocardium, and the coronary arteries, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 7b. These banding artifacts originate from the increase in field inhomogeneity at higher magnetic field strength. Figure 7c was acquired with the new adiabatic T 2 Prep and the local signal variations are no longer visible. However, the contrast between the coronary arteries and the surrounding tissues is still preserved.",
                "Figure 8 shows coronary MR angiograms of an RCA obtained in a healthy adult subject. Nonreformatted slices from the 3D acquisition (Fig. 8a-g) are displayed together with the reformated version obtained from the same data-FIG. 4. M z /M eq after T 2 Prep with two composite MLEV weighted refocusing pulses as a function of off-resonance and B 1 variations. While in the ideal case M z /M eq should uniformly return to M eq (red), large variations of the magnetization occur as a function of both B 0 and B 1 inhomogeneity as shown by the different colors. FIG. 5. M z /M eq after T 2 Prep with four composite MLEV weighted refocusing pulses as a function of off-resonance and B 1 variations. When compared to two refocusing pulses, the plot demonstrates an improved insensitivity to magnetic field variations. This is evidenced by the larger homogeneous area in which the magnetization returns to its equilibrium (red color) after the T 2 Prep. However, by using four refocusing pulses, the total SAR level increases to \u03fe4 W/kg body wt. set (Fig. 8h). Images acquired with the nonadiabatic T 2 Prep (with two composite MLEV weighted refocusing pulses) are visualized in Fig. 8 while those obtained using the adiabatic T 2 Prep are shown in Fig. 9. An enhanced level of image artifacts can be observed in most of the slices (arrows in Fig. 8a-g) and also in the reformatted version if the nonadiabatic T 2 Prep is used. By using the adiabatic T 2 Prep, however, a siginificantly reduced artifact level is observed in both the individual slices (Fig. 9a-g) and in the reformatted image (Fig. 9h).",
                "Statistical comparisons of both objective and subjective measures are shown in Table 1. When comparing the image data obtained with the nonadiabatic and the new adiabatic T 2 Prep, there was a significant increase (P \u03fd 0.002) in the CNR between blood and muscle if the proposed adiabatic T 2 Prep was used. Vessel sharpness did not change significantly. Similarly, no significant change in the SNR of the blood at the level of the coronary ostia was found. Consensus visual grading shows significant differences (P \u03fd 0.0001) between the two different techniques and suggests that the proposed adiabatic T 2 Prep pulse sequence substantially suppresses the artifacts originating from B 1 inhomogeneity. Consistent with earlier finding at 1.5 T, the contrast between blood and muscle was significantly enhanced by adding both nonadiabatic and adiabatic T 2 Prep to the sequence."

                "T 2 Prep is commonly used in coronary MRA to improve the CNR and the vessel definition at 1.5 T (18). This se-quence has been optimized for insensitivity to RF pulse imperfections and off-resonance (13,18) and has been extensively utilized at 1.5 T. To obtain insensitivity to residual field imperfections, this sequence includes four composite refocusing pulses weighted in an MLEV scheme. However, limitations related to SAR do not permit the use of four refocusing pulses unless the maximum amplitude of each hard pulse is substantially reduced.",
                "Our simulation demonstrates that even with four refocusing pulses, the sequence still shows sensitivity to field inhomogeneities. Therefore, we proposed a novel T 2 Prep sequence in which the refocusing of spins is achieved with two identical adiabatic inversion pulses. In this study, we used hyperbolic secant (sech/tanh) adiabatic pulses as AFP pulses. However, there are various other adiabatic pulse pairs that could potentially be used, but the efficacy of these alternative pulses for contrast enhancement in coronary MRA remains to be investigated. Our simulations suggest that signal suppression might be expected at 420 Hz off-resonance. Therefore, T 2 Prep may simultaneously support fat saturation, which is important for coronary MRA (16). However, this remains to be investigated more systematically. Consistent with earlier findings from others at 1.5 T, we also found a 20% reduction in blood signal, and a 30 -40% improvement in blood-muscle CNR upon comparison of no T 2 Prep and both versions of the T 2 Prep. While no improvement in vessel sharpness was found when comparing the nonadiabatic T 2 Prep versus no T 2 Prep, a significant enhancement in vessel sharpness was obtained using the adiabatic T 2 Prep. These findings may be attributed to the compromised T 2 preparation The SAR of the current coronary MRA sequence (with the imaging parameters used in this study) without a T 2 Prep ranges between 0.9 and 1.3 W/kg for a heart rate of 60 to 85 beats per minute. A T 2 Prep with an MLEV phase cycling will increase the SAR by approximately 1.8 W/kg with two refocusing pulses and by \u03f33 W/kg with four refocusing pulses. The adiabatic T 2 Prep sequence will add 2 W/kg to the total SAR of the sequence. Therefore, the total SAR of the coronary MRA sequence with a nonadiabatic T 2 Prep (that includes four refocusing pulses) will exceed the allowed 4 W/kg for human use. The imaging parameters such as TR or maximum amplitude of the transmitted B 1 of the body coil can be adjusted in order to decrease the SAR. This decrease in SAR can be exploited to increase the number of pulses in the phase cycling train. However, an increased sensitivity of the pulse to field imperfections must be considered, as shown by the simulation in Fig. 5."
