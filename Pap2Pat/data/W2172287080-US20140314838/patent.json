                        "Iodinated radiocontrast media are used to enhance the visualization of blood vessels and internal organs for a wide range of diagnostic and/or interventional procedures, including (but not limited to) angiography, urography, pyelography, arthrography, cholangiography, diskography, myelography, contrast-enhanced computer tomography, and cerebral ventriculography. Iodinated radiocontrast media are usually classified as ionic or nonionic. The nonionic radiocontrast media are organic compounds containing covalently bound iodine and are either monomeric or dimeric molecules with three or six atoms of iodine, respectively. Ionic iodinated radiocontrast media were developed before nonionic iodinated radiocontrast media. Both types of iodine-based contrast media are water soluble. Iodinated radiocontrast media are relatively safe drugs, but can cause serious anaphylactic reactions or contrast-induced nephropathy in some patients. The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in the general hospital population is low (1-2%), but can be above 50% in some hospital subpopulations, such as elderly diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Nonionic iodinated radiocontrast media are less nephrotoxic than ionic iodinated radiocontrast media. Contrast-induced nephropathy is the third leading cause of iatrogenic kidney failure (Thomsen et al., Acta Radiol 49:646-657, 2008). The risk factors for development of contrast-induced nephropathy include pre-existing kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, sickle cell anemia, gout flares, multiple myeloma, hypoalbuminemia, hypovolemia, and dehydration. Intravenous administration of iodinated radiocontrast media is less nephrotoxic than administration of the media into either the renal artery or the aorta proximal to the origin of the renal artery (Katzberg & Barrett, Radiology 243:622-628, 2007).",
                        "The iodinated radiocontrast media iodixanol (Visipaque), iohexol (Omnipaque), iopamidol (Isovue), iopentol (Imagopaque), iopromide (Ultravist), ioversol (Optiray), ioxilan (Oxilan), iothalamate (Conray), ioxaglate (Hexabrix), metrizamide (Amipaque), metrizoate (Isopaque), and sodium diatrizoate and meglumine diatrizoate (Urografin) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for numerous diagnostic and/or interventional procedures. The iodinated radiocontrast media iobitridol (Xenetix), iodipamide (Bilignost), iomeprol (lomeron), iotrolan (Isovist), and ioxithalamate (Telebrix) are used in the European Union.",
                        "The development of therapeutics for the treatment, management or prevention of injury to the kidney of humans or other mammals caused by one or more iodinated radiocontrast media has been hampered by the lack of a sensitive noninvasive method for detecting the earliest signs of kidney injury. Acute kidney injury in the clinic is usually diagnosed by determining the concentration of creatinine in serum. Contrast-induced nephropathy is usually defined as an increase in serum creatinine of more than 25% or an increase of more than 0.5 mg/dl within three days after the intravascular administration of contrast media that cannot be explain by other known causes. However, serum creatinine is an insensitive and nonspecific indicator of impaired kidney function. A large reduction in the glomerular filtration rate can occur before there is a detectable increase in serum creatinine. Urinary levels of kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and netrin-1 have been claimed to be more sensitive biomarkers for the earliest signs of kidney injury than serum levels of creatinine (Waanders et al., J Pathol 220:7-16, 2010; Ramesh et al., Transplant Proc 42:1519-1522, 2010). Nogo-B (reticulon 4B) is up-regulated in the proximal tubules of the mouse kidney following unilateral ureteral obstruction and ischemia/reperfusion, and Nogo-B mRNA levels have been suggested to be a sensitive indicator for diverse forms of renal proximal tubule injury (Marin et al., Am J Pathol 177:2765-2773, 2010).",
                        "The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine, vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol) and ascorbic acid have been used as adjunctive cytoprotective agents with iodinated radiocontrast media in small clinical trials without any consistent clear cut evidence of benefit. None of these antioxidants acts via G-protein-coupled receptors and classical signal transduction pathways, and any of these antioxidants could easily be used in combination with PACAP-based therapeutics. Vasodilators and vasoconstrictor antagonists, including fenoldopam, SB 209670, atrial natriuretic peptide, theophylline, and aminophylline, have also been used as adjunctive cytoprotective agents with iodinated radiocontrast media in small clinical trials without any consistent clear cut evidence of benefit. The intravenous administration of isotonic fluids is the only generally accepted strategy to reduce the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy. There are currently no drugs that are approved by the U.S. FDA specifically for use as cytoprotective adjunctive agents with iodinated radiocontrast media.",
                        "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was isolated from ovine (sheep) hypothalami based on its ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in rat anterior pituitary cell cultures (Miyata et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 164:567-574, 1989). PACAP exists as two \u03b1-amidated peptides with 38 (PACAP38; SEQ ID NO:1) or 27 (PACAP27; SEQ ID NO:2) amino acids. Both peptides have the same N-terminal 27 amino acids and are synthesized from the same prohormone. The sequence of PACAP38 is identical in all mammals and differs from the reptilian, avian and amphibian orthologs by only one amino acid (Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 52:269-324, 2000; Valiante et al., Brain Res 1127:66-75, 2007; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 61:283-357, 2009). PACAP is a member of the secretin/vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)/growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) family, and PACAP27 has 68% sequence identity with VIP (SEQ ID NO:3). PACAP is most abundant in the brain and testis, but there are significant levels in other organs, including the adrenals, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and duodenal mucosa (Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 52:269-324, 2000; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 61:283-357, 2009). The amount of PACAP in the kidney is relatively low (Arimura et al., Endocrinology 129:2787-2789, 1991). PACAP is synthesized as a preprohormone and is processed mainly by prohormone convertase 1, prohormone convertase 2 and prohormone convertase 4 (Li et al., Neuroendocrinology 69:217-226, 1999; Li et al., Endocrinology 141:3723-3730, 2000). The half-life of [125I]-PACAP38 in the bloodstream of rats following intravenous injection is 5-6 minutes (Banks et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 267:690-696, 1993). Members of the secretin/VIP/GHRH family are degraded in plasma mainly by aminodipeptidases, especially dipeptidyl peptidase IV (Zhu et al., J Biol Chem 278:22418-2223, 2003).",
                        "A PACAP-specific receptor, designated as the PAC1 receptor, has been cloned from several vertebrate species (Arimura, Jpn J Physiol 48:301-331, 1998; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 52:269-324, 2000; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 61:283-357, 2009). It is a G-protein-coupled receptor with seven putative membrane-spanning domains and belongs to a family of glycoprotein receptors that are coupled to multiple signal transduction pathways (Segre & Goldring, Trends Endocrinol Metab 4:309-314, 1993). PACAP binds not only to the PAC1 receptor with a high affinity, but it also binds to the VIP1 (VPAC1) and VIP2 (VPAC2) receptors with an affinity comparable to or greater than VIP. On the other hand, VIP binds to the PAC1 receptor with an affinity 100-1,000 times less than PACAP (Arimura, Jpn J Physiol 48:301-331, 1998). At least 10 splice variants of the rat PAC1 receptor have been cloned and each variant is coupled to distinct combinations of signal transduction pathways (Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 52:269-324, 2000; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 61:283-357, 2009). The \u201csecond\u201d messengers include adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and calcium. PACAP/VIP receptor can be coupled to G\u03b1s and/or G\u03b1i/o in different types of cells. PACAP/VIP receptors are expressed in many different types of normal cells, including the catecholamine-containing cells in the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic ganglia; microglia, astrocytes and some types of neurons in the central nervous system; and T- and B-lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in the immune system (Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 52:269-324, 2000; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 61:283-357, 2009). PACAP is a potent stimulator of catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla (Watanabe et al., Am J Physiol 269:E903-E909, 1995), but a potent inhibitor of the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 from activated macrophages (Ganea & Delgado, Crit Rev Oral Biol Med 13:229-237, 2002). More pertinent to the present invention, PACAP has been reported to increase blood flow in the kidney (Nilsson, Eur J Pharmacol 253:17-25, 1994).",
                        "Although PACAP was isolated during a screen for novel hypophysiotropic factors, it soon became apparent that it is a pleiotropic peptide (Arimura, Jpn J Physiol 48:301-331, 1998; Vaudry et al., Pharmacol Rev 52:269-324, 2000). The extraordinarily potent neuroprotective/neurotrophic properties of PACAP were investigated by several laboratories shortly after its isolation. The cytoprotective effects of PACAP and VIP have been studied much more extensively in the nervous system than in any other major organ of the body. For example, PACAP prevented the neuronal death induced by gp120, the envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in rat hippocampal neuron/glia co-cultures. The dose-response curve was bimodal, with peaks at 10\u221213 M and 10\u221210 M (Arimura et al., Ann NY Acad Sci 739:228-243, 1994). The critical findings in this study have been confirmed by Kong et al. (Neuroscience 91:493-500, 1999), who used lipopolysaccharide as the neurotoxin in primary murine cortical neuron/glia co-cultures. The neuroprotective effect at 10\u221212 M was correlated with a significant reduction in the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium. The neuroprotective effect of \u201clow\u201d (femtomolar) doses of PACAP in neuron/glia co-cultures was abolished by PD98059, a MAP kinase inhibitor, but the neuroprotective effect of \u201chigh\u201d (nanomolar) doses of PACAP was not affected by PD98059 (Li et al., J Mol Neurosci 27:91-106, 2005). However, the neuroprotective effect of nanomolar doses of PACAP was abolished by Rp-cAMP, a protein kinase A inhibitor.",
                        "The drawbacks of using peptides for neuroprotection in the brain include their poor transport across the blood-brain barrier and their short half-life in the circulation after systemic administration. However, PACAP38 is transported from the blood to the brain via a saturable mechanism (Banks et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 267:690-696, 1993). Delayed systemic administration of PACAP has been shown to be neuroprotective in common in vivo preclinical models for both heart attack (Uchida et al., Brain Res 736:280-286, 1996) and stroke (Reglodi et al., Stroke 31:1411-1417, 2000). PACAP has also been shown by other laboratories to be neuroprotective in common in vivo preclinical models for other neurological diseases, including spinal cord injury (Chen & Tzeng, Neurosci Lett 384:117-121, 2005), Alzheimer's disease (Rat et al., FASEB J 25:3208-3218, 2011) and Parkinson's disease (Reglodi et al., Behav Brain Res 151:303-312, 2004).",
                        "The neuroprotective effects of low concentrations of PACAP in the nervous system are indirect and are probably mediated by at least four distinct mechanisms. (1) PACAP is a potent anti-inflammatory peptide. It has been shown to inhibit the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in activated macrophages, to inhibit the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12 in activated macrophages, and to stimulate the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in activated macrophages (Ganea & Delgado, Crit Rev Oral Biol Med 13:229-237, 2002). PACAP is also an extraordinarily potent \u201cdeactivator\u201d of activated microglial cells (Kong et al., Neuroscience 91:493-500, 1999; Delgado et al., Glia 39:148-161, 2002), which are the resident macrophage-like cells in the nervous system. (2) Femtomolar (10\u221215 M) concentrations of PACAP increase the levels of the mRNA for activity-dependent neurotrophic factor in murine neuron/glia co-cultures (David et al., Society for Neuroscience [33rd Annual Meeting], New Orleans, La., #38.1 [Abstract], 2003). (3) Yang et al. (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 319:595-603, 2006) have shown that femtomolar concentrations of PACAP inhibit microglial NADPH oxidase activity and extracellular superoxide levels in mesencephalic neuron/glia co-cultures. (4) Figiel & Engele (J Neurosci 20:3596-3605, 2000) have reported that PACAP increased the expression of the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST and increased the activity of the glutamate metabolizing enzyme glutamine synthetase in astrocytes. These effects of PACAP would be expected to decrease glutamatergic neurotransmission.",
                        "The cytoprotective properties of PACAP and VIP have been studied far less extensively in the kidney than in the nervous system. PACAP has been shown to protect the kidney against injuries caused by ischemia/reperfusion (Riera et al., Transplantation 72:1217-1223, 2001; Szakaly et al., J Mol Neurosci 36:89-96, 2008; Li et al., Am J Nephrol 32:522-532, 2010), the commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin (Li et al., Regul Pept 145:24-32, 2008), light-chain immunoglobulin overload (Li et al., Regul Pept 145:24-32, 2008), and acute administration of cisplatin (Li et al., 2009, Li et al., J Mol Neurosci 43:58-66, 2011) and cyclosporine A (Khan et al., J Invest Med 59:793-802, 2011). Nephrotoxicity is usually the \u201cdose-limiting\u201d toxicity for gentamicin, cisplatin and cyclosporine A. The renoprotective effects of PACAP, like the neuroprotective effects of PACAP, are associated with suppression of innate immune responses (e.g., Li et al., J Mol Neurosci 43:58-66, 2011). PACAP has also been shown to inhibit the production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 by macrophages (Sun et al., J Neuroimmunol 107:88-99, 2000).",
                        "PACAP-like peptides have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of most normal hematopoietic cells (e.g., Ottaway & Greenberg, J Immunol 132:417-423, 1984; Boudard & Bastide, J Neurosci Res 29:29-41, 1991; Tatsuno et al., Endocrinology 128:728-734, 1991; Trejter et al., Histol Histopathol 16:155-158, 2001).",
                        "Native PACAP has already been administered to healthy human volunteers by investigators in at least five different laboratories (Hammond et al., J Endocrinol 137:529-532, 1993; Chiodera et al., Neuroendocrinology 64:242-246, 1996; Filipsson et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab 82:3093-3098, 1997; Doberer et al., Eur J Clin Invest 37:665-672, 2007; Murck et al., Am J Physiol 292:E853-E857, 2007) and to a patient with multiple myeloma under a U.S. FDA-approved single-patient protocol (Li et al., Peptides 28:1891-1895, 2007). The only untoward effect reported was a transient flushing.",
                        "The published literature indicates that PACAP-like peptides can protect neurons (neuroepithelial cells) against a very broad range of injuries, including ischemia/reperfusion injury. The published literature also indicates that PACAP-like peptides can protect renal epithelial cells against injury due to ischemia/reperfusion.",
                        "Whether PACAP-like peptides can protect renal epithelial cells against iodinated radiocontrast agents has not been previously investigated.",

                        "The inventors have found that native human PACAP38 and PACAP analogs are extremely effective in protecting organs of the body (e.g., the kidney) against injury caused by a contrast agent, such as an iodinated radiocontrast media or a gadolinium-based magnetic resonance agent.",
                        "Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment, management, prevention, and/or reduction of injury to one or more organs of the body (e.g., nervous system, brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, gastrointestinal tract, adrenal gland, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, breast, ovary, testes, and/or prostate; preferably the kidney) of a human or other mammal caused by, or as a result of, administration of one or more contrast agents (e.g., iodinated radiocontrast media or gadolinium-based magnetic resonance agents) to the human or other mammal. The method involves the administration of an effective amount of one or more PACAP-like compounds which includes native human PACAP38, native human PACAP27, VIP, their agonists, analogs, fragments, or derivatives, having activities at one or more PACAP/VIP receptors (e.g., a PACAP-like compound having at least 60% (more preferably 70%, 75%, 80%, or 85%, and most preferably 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, or 100%) sequence identity to one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 1-76), for the inhibition of a pathology-causing cell phenotype in the organ(s) (e.g., the kidney) caused by, or resulting from, one or more of the contrast agents.",
                        "The PACAP-like compounds of this invention can be purified from normal cells or extracellular fluids, synthesized by the methods of recombinant molecular biology, or (in the most common embodiment) synthesized by the methods of peptide chemistry.",
                        "PACAP-like compounds are extremely effective in protecting and/or rescuing kidney epithelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, the present invention also relates to a method of treatment of these cells at a concentration of about 10\u221213 M to 10\u22126 M of the PACAP-like compound. When these cells are in culture, the concentration of the PACAP-like compound is preferably between 10\u221213 M and 10\u22126 M in the culture medium. When these cells are in the organs of a subject, the concentration of the PACAP-like compound is preferably between about 10\u221213M to 10\u22126 M in the interstitial space or blood. The inventors have discovered that within the generally effective concentration range of the composition of this invention, there is a peak effectiveness, below which the effectiveness of the composition falls off to a significant degree. A concentration of the PACAP composition of the present invention between about 10\u221213 M and about 10\u22126 M permits treatment of the subject with minimal risk of adverse side effects from the treatment. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of the PACAP-like compound is about 10\u22129 M.",
                        "The present discovery makes possible the use of the compositions of this invention in low concentrations to provide substantial protection and rescue of cells and tissues in organs of the body (e.g., kidney epithelial cells). In a specific embodiment, the composition of the present invention protects these cells and tissues from injury or death. The injury or death of these cells or tissues may be due to treatment with one or more commonly used iodinated contrast agents, including (but not limited to), iobitridol, iodipamide, iodixanol, iohexol, iomeprol, iopamidol, iopentol, iopromide, iotrolan, ioversol, ioxilan, iothalamate, ioxithalamate, ioxaglate, metrizamide, acetrizoate, metrizoate, and diatrizoate.",
                        "The compositions of the present invention may be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or otherwise into the bloodstream in order to achieve the optimal concentration for the treatment, management or prevention of injury to an organ of the body (e.g., the kidney) of a human or other mammal caused by a contrast agent, such as an iodinated radiocontrast media or a gadolinium-based magnetic resonance agent. The intravenous administration of the compositions of the present invention may be as a bolus injection, as a constant infusion (e.g., over a period of 1 to 24 hours, more preferably over a period of 1 to 12 hours) or as a bolus injection followed immediately by a constant infusion. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is being treated with one or more contrast agents (e.g., one or more iodinated contrast agents) for a cardiac angiography and the PACAP-like compound is administered as a bolus injection (in order to saturate any serum binding proteins) followed immediately by a constant infusion. In a preferred embodiment, parenteral administration is used. In several embodiments, the PACAP-like compound is administered to a mammal in need thereof, (e.g., a human) at a dose in the range of 1 \u03bcg to 1 gram (e.g., 100 to 5000 \u03bcg, such as about 500 \u03bcg).",
                        "The compositions of the present invention may be administered into the renal artery in order to have preferential access to the kidney.",
                        "The compositions of the present invention may also be administered in a controlled-release or a sustained-release formulation. In a preferred embodiment, the subjects are treated with one or more nonionic iodinated radiocontrast media for cardiac angiography.",
                        "The compositions of the present invention may be administered after encapsulation in liposomes or microparticles. The compositions of the present invention may also be administered transcutaneously after encapsulation in dendrimers. In a preferred embodiment, the subjects are treated with one or more iodinated radiocontrast media for a diagnostic or interventional cardiovascular procedure.",
                        "The compositions of the present invention may be administered in combination with other cytoprotective agents that have different mechanisms of action, including (but not limited to) ascorbic acid, vitamin E, mesna, palifermin (human keratinocyte growth factor), erythropoietin, apocynin, diphenylene iodonium, pentoxifylline, etanercept, simvastatin, amifostine, dexrazoxane, and N-acetylcysteine in order to have an additive or a synergistic effect.",
                        "The compositions of the present invention may be administered in combination with vasodilators or vasoconstrictor antagonists, including (but not limited to) fenoldopam, SB 209670, atrial natriuretic peptide, theophylline, and aminophylline, in order to have an additive or a synergistic effect.",
                        "In an embodiment of the invention, injury to one or more organs of the body, e.g., the kidney, caused by a contrast agent, such as an iodinated radiocontrast media or a gadolinium-based magnetic resonance agent, can be assessed by determining the present of one or more of the following risk factors: pre-existing kidney disease(s), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, sickle cell anemia, gout flares, multiple myeloma, hypoalbuminemia, hypovolemia, and dehydration.",
                        "In another embodiment of the invention, injury to one or more organs of the body, e.g., the kidney, caused by a contrast agent, such as an iodinated radiocontrast media or a gadolinium-based magnetic resonance agent, can be assessed by determining the level of one or more biomarkers, either at the protein level or at the mRNA level. These biomarkers include one or more of the following creatinine, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), netrin-1, Nogo-B (reticulon 4B), NADPH oxidase (Nox)-4, Nox-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). For example, organ injury, such as kidney injury, may be assessed by determining the concentration of creatinine in serum or urine. Contrast-induced nephropathy is usually defined as an increase in serum creatinine of more than 25% or an increase of more than 0.5 mg/dl within three days after the intravascular administration of contrast media that cannot be explain by other known causes. In another embodiment, urinary levels of kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and/or netrin-1 may be assessed as a biomarkers of kidney injury instead of, or in combination with, a determination of serum or urinary levels of creatinine. In still another embodiment, the level of Nogo-B (reticulon 4B), which is up-regulated in the proximal tubules of the mouse kidney following unilateral ureteral obstruction and ischemia/reperfusion, and/or Nogo-B mRNA, may be assessed as an indicator of diverse forms of renal proximal tubule injury. Also, an increase in the level of Nox-4 and/or Nox-2 mRNA may be assessed as an indicator of organ injury, e.g., kidney injury.",
                        "Therapy, according to the present invention, may also be assessed by determining a decrease in the level of one or more of the following biomarkers, either at the protein level or at the mRNA level: creatinine, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), netrin-1, Nogo-B (reticulon 4B), Nox-4, Nox-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). The decrease in biomarker expression may be determined by assessing the level of the biomarker in a sample, such as a bodily fluid (e.g., blood (e.g., serum), urine, saliva, and/or lymph) or tissue (e.g., one or more cells) of the mammal. The decrease in the expression level of the biomarker in the sample (e.g., the biomarker protein and/or mRNA) may be at least 5% (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% or more), relative to a control sample from a similarly situated mammal that is not treated according to the method(s) of the present invention.",
                        "Therapy, according to the present invention, may also be assessed by determining a decrease in cell death in a mammal following administration of one or more PACAP-like compounds (alone or in combination with one or more cytoprotective agents). The decrease in cell death may be, e.g., at least 5% (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, or 85%, or more), relative to a similarly situated control mammal that is not treated according to the method(s) of the present invention."

The preferred method of administration can vary depending on various factors, e.g., the components of the pharmaceutical composition, site of the potential or actual injury (e.g., the location of injured organ), and the severity of injury.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201canalog\u201d refers to both conformational and linear sequence analogs. Maxadilan, a 61-amino-acid peptide with two disulfide bridges that is synthesized naturally in the salivary glands of the hematophagous sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, is one example of a conformational analog of PACAP. It has no obvious linear amino-acid sequence identities with PACAP but binds preferentially to the PAC1 receptors with high affinity (Tatsuno et al., Brain Res 889:138-148, 2001; Lerner et al., Peptides 28:1651-1654, 2007). The amino-acid sequences of maxadilan made by sand flies from different regions of Central and South America can differ by more than 20%. However, the relative positions of the cysteine residues in these bioactive orthologs are invariant and all of these bioactive orthologs have a similar predicted secondary structure. The amino-acid sequences of some naturally occurring maxadilans are described by Lanzaro et al. (Insect Mol Biol 8:267-275, 1999). The amino-acid sequence of one naturally occurring maxadilan is shown as SEQ ID NO:76. Therefore, linear analogs of conformational analogs of PACAP, such as linear analogs of maxadilan (Reddy et al., J Biol Chem 281:16197-16201, 2006), would be expected to bind to and stimulate PACAP/VIP receptors. Those skilled in the art will recognize that additional conformational analogs of PACAP could be created by synthetic combinatorial chemistry or phage display technologies. A peptide analog may contain one or more amino acids that occur naturally in mammalian cells but do not occur naturally in mammalian peptides. For example (but not by way of limitation), a peptide analog may contain \u03b3-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA), \u03b2-alanine, ornithine, and citrulline. An analog of a peptide may also contain one or more nonnatural amino acids that do not occur naturally in mammalian cells. For example (but not by way of limitation), an analog of a peptide may also contain D-alanine, naphthylalanine, pyridylalanine, and norleucine. An analog may have an extension of one or more naturally occurring and/or nonnatural amino acids at its amino terminus and/or its carboxyl terminus. The extension at the amino terminus and/or the carboxyl terminus may include one or more additional copies of the same peptide and/or other bioactive peptides. The extension at the amino terminus and/or the carboxyl terminus may include one or more sites for proteolytic processing in order to make the extended peptide function as a precursor (prodrug) for the bioactive peptide. For example, the PACAP-like compounds may include cleavage sites at the amino terminus and/or the carboxyl terminus for one or more of the following proteolytic enzymes: trypsin, chymotrypsin, a prohormone convertase (e.g., prohormone convertase 1, 2, 4, or 7), furin, chymase, thrombin, calpain, a cathepsin (e.g., cathepsin A, B, D, G, H, or L), papain, Factor Xa, Factor IXa, Factor XIa, renin, chymosin (rennin), thermolysin, a kallikrein, an elastase, and a matrix metalloproteinase.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cderivative\u201d refers to a peptide that has been modified by the covalent attachment of another molecule and/or a functional group to the peptide chain. For example (but not by way of limitation), a derivative of a peptide may be produced by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, acylation, alkylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, sulfation, formylation, methylation, demethylation, amidation, gamma-carboxylation, cyclization, lactamization, prenylation, myristoylation, iodination, selenoylation, ribosylation, ubiquitination, or hydroxylation. The derivatized peptide can be a peptide analog. A derivative of a peptide can easily be made by standard techniques known to those of skilled in the art. A derivative of a peptide may possess an identical function(s) to the parent peptide. A derivative of a peptide may also have one or more other functions in addition to the function(s) of the parent peptide. For example (but not by way of limitation), a derivative of a peptide may have a longer half-life than the parent peptide and/or have cytoprotective or cytotoxic properties that are not possessed by the parent peptide.",

The use of the term \u201cin combination with\u201d does not restrict the order in which the therapeutic or cytoprotective agent is administered to a subject or mammal. One therapeutic or cytoprotective agent can be administered prior to, concomitantly with, or subsequent to the administration of the other therapeutic or cytoprotective agent. The therapies are administered to a subject or mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the PACAP-like compound(s) of the present invention can act together with the other agent to provide a different response from the subject or mammal, preferably a greater therapeutic or cytoprotective benefit, than if they were administered otherwise.",

Peptidomimetic compounds that are functionally equivalents to the PACAP-like compounds of the present invention can be rationally designed by those skilled in the art based on published structure-activity studies (e.g., Igarashi et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 301:37-50, 2002; Igarashi et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther 303:445-460, 2002; Bourgault et al., Peptides 29:919-932, 2008; Bourgault et al., J Med Chem 52:3308-3316, 2009).",
                        "The terms \u201cpercent identity\u201d and \u201cpercent similarity\u201d can be used to compare the amino-acid sequences of two peptides. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino-acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino-acid sequence). The amino-acid residues at the corresponding amino-acid positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino-acid residue at the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=the number of identical overlapping positions/total number of positions\u00d7100%). In the most common embodiment, the two amino-acid sequences are the same length. To determine the percent similarity of two amino acid sequences, the sequences are also aligned for optimal comparison purposes. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by either the same amino-acid residue or a \u201cconserved\u201d amino acid at the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are similar at that position. The percent similarity between the two sequences is a function of the number of corresponding positions in the amino acid sequences at which the amino acids are either identical or the different amino acids are conserved substituents (i.e., % similarity=the number of identical or conserved overlapping positions/total number of positions\u00d7100%). A conservative substitution is a substitution of one amino acid by another amino acid with a similar side-chain. A conservative substitution frequently results in an analog with similar physical and biological properties.

The inventors of the present patent application have also discovered that the nephrotoxicity caused by iodinated radiocontrast media in mice in vivo can be dramatically reduced by native human PACAP38 and analogs, fragments and derivatives of PACAP38. The inventors of the present patent application have further discovered that the nephrotoxicity caused by both ionic and nonionic iodinated radiocontrast media can be dramatically reduced by native human PACAP38 and analogs, fragments and derivatives of PACAP38. Furthermore, the severity of the anaphylactic reaction caused by iodinated radiocontrast media in some subjects and the severity of the nephrogenic systemic fibrosis caused by gadolinium-based contrast agents in some subjects can also be reduced by native human PACAP38 and analogs, fragments and derivatives of PACAP38. The present inventors have also discovered that the severity of an injury to one or more organs of the body of a subject (e.g., kidney injury) caused by iodinated radiocontrast media can be reliably monitored noninvasively by determining the levels of one or more of the following biomarkers in a sample from a subject, either at the protein level or at the mRNA level: creatinine, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), netrin-1, Nogo-B (reticulon 4B), Nox-4, Nox-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In particular, kidney injury may be reliably monitored by determining, e.g., KIM-1 levels in urine.",

                                "The present invention provides methods for assaying and screening for PACAP-like compounds, such as PACAP38, PACAP27, VIP, their agonists, analogs, fragments, or derivatives, suitable for use in the method of the present invention by incubating the compounds with epithelial cells containing one or more PACAP/VIP receptors, e.g., kidney epithelial cells and hematopoietic cells, and then assaying for a reduction in a pathology-causing cell phenotype or an inhibition of cell proliferation (see, e.g., Li et al., Regul Pept 145:24-32, 2008). For example, a PACAP-like compound that would be useful for the method of the present invention should increase the viability of iodinated radiocontrast agent-treated kidney epithelial cells and decrease the rate of proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Alternatively, one may assay and screen for PACAP-like compounds, such as PACAP38, PACAP27, VIP, their agonists, analogs, fragments, or derivatives, suitable for use in the method of the present invention by assaying for a decrease in the level of one or more of the following biomarkers, either at the protein level or at the mRNA level: creatinine, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), netrin-1, Nogo-B (reticulon 4B), Nox-4, Nox-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In addition, the intrinsic activity of any PACAP-like compound at each of the three PACAP/VIP receptors can be determined in stably transfected cell lines that express only one of these receptors by measuring the intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP (Tatsuno et al., Brain Res 889:138-148, 2001). Radioligand receptor binding assays can be used to determine the affinity of a compound for each of the PACAP/VIP receptors. However, radioligand receptor binding assays do not differentiate between receptor agonists and receptor antagonists. Therefore, other types of assays well known to those skilled in the art must be used to discriminate between PACAP/VIP receptor agonists and PACAP/VIP receptor antagonists.",

In the preferred embodiment, the fragmentation of nuclear DNA or caspase 3 activity is determined.",

The stimulation is stopped by the addition of ice-cold 20% trifluoroacetic acid. The cAMP is extracted from the cells, the extracts are centrifuged, the supernatants are placed into small plastic vials, and the supernatants are lyophilized for assay of the levels of cAMP. In the preferred embodiment, the intracellular levels of cAMP are quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."

Briefly, a Me-benzhydrylamine resin is used to yield amides directly after HF cleavage. Forty percent trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/methylene chloride is used for Boc removal and couplings are achieved by diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) or TBTU/DIPEA activation or DIC/HOBt preactivation and active ester coupling. We estimate that approximately 20% of the couplings, which are monitored at each stage by the Kaiser ninhydrin test, fail to reach completion in I hour. Almost all of these resistant couplings can be driven to completion in 15-30 minutes by repeated coupling of the corresponding HOBt activated ester in dimethylformamide to which a catalytic amount of dimethylaminopyridine can be added for additional coupling power. CS Bio automated peptide synthesizers allow all of these pre-activations, double couplings, etc. to be fully automated with a concomitant increase in the speed of synthesis. Side-chain protection groups commonly used are: Asp and Glu, cHex; Ser and Thr, Bzl; Arg and His, tosyl (or Bom for His); Lys, 2-CI-Z; and Tyr, 2-Br-Z.",

Excess HF is removed rapidly (\u02dcI0 minutes) under a rapid flow of dry nitrogen. With linear peptides, the resin is extracted with 2 M acetic acid and applied directly to preparative chromatography systems (either 1.5 or 2.5\u00d725 cm columns) containing Vydac C-I8 or phenyl-silica of 300-angstrom pore size (particle size 10 \u03bcm). Two fully volatile solvent elution systems have been used successfully for all of these peptides: linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA and acetonitrile in 20% acetic acid (excellent for insoluble peptides) at flow rates of about 8-20 ml/min. Gradients are generated with Rainin programmable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pumps and a typical separation run would normally be completed within 1 hour.",

Wild-type mice, like healthy humans, are resistant to contrast-induced nephropathy. The inhibition of nitric oxide synthases and cyclooxygenases with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and indomethacin, respectively, has been used to make mice more sensitive to iodinated radiocontrast media (e.g., Billings et al., Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 295:F741-F748, 2008). However, these two nonspecific inhibitors interfere with the mechanisms that normally mediate contrast-induced nephropathy and add multiple sources of variance to the experiments.",

Mice with homozygous deficiency of both eNOS and either leptin or the leptin receptor provide a clinically relevant model for the patient population that is at the highest risk for developing contrast-induced nephropathy."

                                "Iodinated radiocontrast media are used to enhance the visualization of blood vessels and internal organs for a wide range of diagnostic and/or interventional procedures. Nephrotoxicity is usually the \u201cdose-limiting\u201d toxicity for the use of iodinated radiocontrast media as therapeutics. The toxic effects of short-term treatment with iodinated radiocontrast media on the kidney are characterized by a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, which is usually assessed as an increase in creatinine or cystatin C in serum, and injury to the proximal tubule epithelial cells, which is assessed as an increase in KIM-1 or netrin-1 in the urine.",
                                "Treatment of human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells with Urografin resulted in a large significant increase in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the culture medium (FIG. 2). The addition of PACAP38 to the medium resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in Urografin-induced cell death of the human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. At the highest dose tested, PACAP38 reduced the cell death caused by Urografin by more than 70%. The addition of VIP to the medium also resulted in a significant dose-dependent reduction in Urografin-induced cell death of the human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. PACAP was significantly more potent than VIP. In addition, a wide variety of PACAP analogs significantly reduced the Urografin-induced cytotoxicity of human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (FIG. 3). Treatment of human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells with Urografin also resulted in a large significant increase in the concentration of KIM-1 in the medium (FIG. 5). The addition of PACAP38 to the medium significantly reduced the Urografin-induced secretion of KIM-1 into the medium.",

Male homozygous eNOS-deficient mice were given a single intravenous injection of Urografin. Some of these mice were also given 20 \u03bcg of PACAP38 intraperitoneally 1 hour before the injection of Urografin and an additional dose 12 hours after the injection of Urografin. The mice treated only with Urografin had significantly increased serum levels of cystatin C (FIG. 6) and creatinine (FIG. 11), and significantly increased kidney levels of KIM-1 mRNA (FIG. 7), Nogo-B1 mRNA (FIG. 12) and netrin-1 mRNA (FIG. 8).
