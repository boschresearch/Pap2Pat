    "title": "Carbon catabolite repression correlates with the maintenance of near invariant molecular crowding in proliferating E. coli cells",
    "date": "2013-12-01",
    "abstract": "Background Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is critical for optimal bacterial growth, and in bacterial (and yeast) cells it leads to their selective consumption of a single substrate from a complex environment. However, the root cause(s) for the development of this regulatory mechanism is unknown. Previously, a flux balance model (FBAwMC) of Escherichia coli metabolism that takes into account the crowded intracellular milieu of the bacterial cell correctly predicted selective glucose uptake in a medium containing five different carbon sources, suggesting that CCR may be an adaptive mechanism that ensures optimal bacterial metabolic network activity for growth. Results Here, we show that slowly growing E. coli cells do not display CCR in a mixed substrate culture and gradual activation of CCR correlates with an increasing rate of E. coli cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, CCR mutant cells do not achieve fast growth in mixed substrate culture, and display differences in their cell volume and density compared to wild-type cells. Analyses of transcriptome data from wt E. coli cells indicate the expected regulation of substrate uptake and metabolic pathway utilization upon growth rate change. We also find that forced transient increase of intracellular crowding or transient perturbation of CCR delay cell growth, the latter leading to associated cell density-and volume alterations. Conclusions CCR is activated at an increased bacterial cell growth rate when it is required for optimal cell growth while intracellular macromolecular density is maintained within a narrow physiological range. In addition to CCR, there are likely to be other regulatory mechanisms of cell metabolism that have evolved to ensure optimal cell growth in the context of the fundamental biophysical constraint imposed by intracellular molecular crowding.",

                "Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) denotes the phenomenon of selective substrate uptake from complex media by yeast and bacterial cells [1]. Indeed, E. coli strains with defective CCR display slower glucose uptake and growth [2-4], suggesting that CCR contributes significantly to their survival and proliferation in ever changing nutrient conditions. CCR is mediated by various mechanisms, including transcriptional repression and protein-protein interaction-mediated inhibition of substrate uptake- and catabolism related proteins [5,6]. However, the fundamental reason(s) for the development of this regulatory mechanism remains poorly understood.",
                "In a previous study, we observed the characteristic CCR in E. coli cells that were grown in batch culture in a medium containing an equal mix of five different carbon substrates [7]. In that study we developed a constraint-based modeling framework [8], called flux balance analysis with macromolecular crowding (FBAwMC). This model has successfully predicted the observed sequential substrate uptake kinetics by using a modified form of FBA, which takes into account the total enzyme occupancy limit inside the cell due to the highly crowded nature of the cell\u2019s cytoplasm [7].",
                "Volume exclusion by the presence of macromolecules (macromolecular crowding [MC]), has various effects on biochemical reactions both in-vitro and inside the cell [9,10]. In-vitro systems show that increased macromolecular concentration attenuates diffusion limited reactions [11,12] but accelerates the transition state-limited reactions [13], accelerates and stabilizes gene-and protein expression [14], promotes correct protein folding by extending association between the unfolded polypeptides with chaperon proteins [15] and prevents protein aggregation [16]. In E. coli cells, in which the concentration of total protein and RNA is in the range of 200\u2009~\u2009300\u00a0g/l [17], increased macromolecular density enhances the self-association of bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ [18], increases PTS (phosphor-transferase system) flux and activities [19], and may promote the reorganization of cell metabolism in rapidly proliferating cells from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to simultaneous OxPhos and aerobic glycolysis [20]. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies indicate that normally functioning cells maintain their intracellular macromolecular density within a narrow physiological range [21-26].",
                "In light of these observations, we have hypothesized that CCR is a regulatory mechanism for the maintenance of a near constant intracellular macromolecular density in cells producing biomass at a rapid rate. To test this hypothesis, in this study we characterize the growth of E. coli cells both in single substrate-limited and mixed substrate cultures. We find that in mixed substrate cultures E. coli cells do not display CCR at slow growth rates and that the gradual activation of CCR correlates with the increasing rate of E. coli cell growth and proliferation. We also find that a forced transient increase of intracellular macromolecular crowding (MC) or perturbation of CCR delays cell growth. Moreover, cell density and volume alteration were associated with CCR perturbation. Thus CCR appears to represent an adaptive mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of physiological intracellular macromolecular density in bacterial cells for optimal cell growth."

The carbon source consumption profiles we observed [7] were compatible with the presence of carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in the culture, in which the sole consumption of glucose preceded the concomitant utilization of all other substrates (Figure\u00a01D). To better understand the root cause of the observed substrate uptake patterns, we grew E. coli cells separately in the individual components of the mixed culture medium (i.e., in single carbon-limited media), the experiments being terminated upon substrate exhaustion from the growth media or when cells entered the stationary phase.",
                        "Compared with the mixed substrate culture, the culture density (Figure\u00a01A) and growth kinetics (Figure\u00a01B) of E. coli cells in single carbon-limited media significantly differed, glucose-limited cultures displaying the fastest-and lactate-limited cultures the slowest growth. In terms of their maximal biomass glucose, maltose-, and galactose-limited cultures were comparable and slightly below the glycerol-limited culture (which achieved the highest biomass), while lactate-limited growth resulted in about one half of that level (Figure\u00a01A). As in the mixed culture, all growth rate kinetic curves displayed an initial increase, peaked in the early exponential growth phase, and then decreased (Figure\u00a01B). However, compared to the growth rate seen in the mixed substrate culture the curves were substantially flattened for the galactose-, lactate-, and glycerol-limited cultures and slightly less flattened for the glucose- and maltose-limited cultures (Figure\u00a01B). This behavior correlated with their delayed substrate uptake rate from the culture media (Figure\u00a01E). Acetate (i.e., acetic acid) secretion by E. coli cells mirrored these trends, except that in contrast to that seen in the mixed substrate culture (Figure\u00a01C, black tracing) on a population level there was no evidence for acetate reuptake in the single carbon cultures (Figure\u00a01C)."

It is evident that the order of intrinsic substrate uptake rate among the five single substrate cultures (Figure\u00a01H) has varied from that seen in the mixed culture medium (Figure\u00a01G). The rate of glucose and maltose uptake rates have displayed consistent consumption ranks in both culture types (first and second, respectively), while the other three substrates displayed different consumption orders. Of note, the consumption rates of all the substrates proved higher in the mixed substrate culture than in the single carbon-limited cultures.",
                        "We previously developed a model of E. coli metabolism to investigate the origin of the substrate hierarchy consumption in mixed substrate cultures [7]. This model, called flux balance analysis with molecular crowding (FBAwMC) obtains the steady-state metabolic flux distribution that result in the maximum biomass production rate given the available nutrients [7,20]. Here we used FBAwMC to model substrate utilization in the single carbon-limited cultures, finding that its predictions (Figure\u00a01F) are similar to the observed uptake profiles (Figure\u00a01E), while the same model without applying MC as a constraint failed to predict this behavior. The modeling and experimental results thus imply that intracellular macromolecular crowding may relate to the presence of CCR in mixed cell culture."

                        "The presence of a single substrate in a growth medium is known to exert a repressive effect on the uptake of other substrates (reviewed in [6]); For example, glucose represses the transcription of genes encoding transporters of other non-PTS substrates, as previously reported in [7]. Each of the specific substrates also tends to upregulate a spectrum of genes including its own transporter genes due to substrate induction [27,28]. The sequential substrate uptake observed in mixed substrate growth medium (Figure\u00a01D), however, suggest that it is a result of strict CCR. Although substrate induction observed in single substrate culture tended to repress the expression of other substrates\u2019 transporter genes (Additional file 1: Figure S1), the repression should be more stringent when multiple substrates are present. To test this hypothesis, we examined the promoter activities of operons within the maltose regulon upon their induction in single carbon limited- and mixed substrates cultures using promoter-GFP reporter plasmid-containing E. coli cells (Additional file 2: Figure S2 and Table S1). We used a real-time monitoring system, in which the ratios of GFP/OD600nm of cells, with or without maltose regulon induction, were calculated to evaluate promoter activities (Additional file 2: Figure S2).",
                        "Selected maltose operon promoters, such as malE and malK, whose gene products are subunits of the maltose transporter, responded strongly to the inducers, maltotriose and cAMP, in glucose-, galactose-, and glycerol-limited cultures (Figure\u00a02A-C) and displayed milder responses in lactate- and maltose-limited cultures (Figure\u00a02D, E). In contrast, delayed and repressed promoter responses were evident in the mixed substrate culture (Figure\u00a02F). Of note, the repressed gene activities in mixed substrate cannot be interpreted as higher basal gene activity because the GFP/OD levels in mixed substrate culture were similar to that in the maltose culture (data not shown). These data indicate the presence of stronger CCR in mixed substrate- than in single substrate-limited growth media."

                        "To further investigate the potential relationship between CCR and the biomass production (i.e., growth) rate of cells, we next examined substrate consumption behavior in a mixed-substrate E. coli culture at various cell growth rates. In continuous-feed chemostat cultures the growth rate of E. coli cells can be precisely controlled by changing the culture\u2019s dilution rate. As cells respond to a stepwise increase in the dilution rate of the growth medium, their rate of biomass synthesis and cell division increases [20]. We sampled the chemostat culture 24\u00a0hr after increasing the dilution rate (i.e., after the culture has reached a new steady state growth rate [20] and measured the culture density (OD600nm), the pH of the growth medium, and the E. coli cell volume and cell density.",
                        "As in glucose-limited culture [20], the cell concentration in the culture medium (i.e., the culture density) decreases with the increased exchange rate of the culture medium (Figure\u00a03A, red curve). Also, the pH of the culture medium decreases slightly to pH\u2009~\u20096.8 at 0.2/hr dilution rate but then returns to pH\u2009~\u20096.9 and above at growth rates higher than 0.3/hr. This is likely due to the faster dilution rate of the pH\u00a07.0 growth medium (Figure\u00a03A, green curve). From a cell volume of 0.89\u00a0fL at the 0.1/hr dilution rate there is an initial increase in the volume of E. coli cells with increasing dilution (and cell growth) rate that reaches its peak (1.064\u00a0fL) at 0.4/hr, and then decreases and levels off with ~0.98\u00a0fL at the highest dilution rate of 0.7/hr (Figure\u00a03A, purple curve). However, the buoyant density of E. coli cells displays much less variation. It is lowest (1.11\u00a0g/ml) at the lowest dilution/ growth rate at 0.1/hr, and then reaches a medium density (~1.13\u00a0g/ml) at growth rates 0.2 and 0.3/hr, respectively. Cell density reaches its highest value of ~1.14\u00a0g/ml at 0.4/hr dilution rate that is then maintained till 0.7/hr. These data indicate that while cell volumes change dynamically to match the faster biomass accumulation rate brought on by faster cell growth, cell buoyant density remains remarkably stable and does not increase above a threshold level.",
                        "Simultaneously, substrate consumption profiles indicate a clear correlation between the rate of cell proliferation and the presence of CCR (Figure\u00a03B, C, [in Figure\u00a03C, the specific substrate uptake rate is normalized to the total substrate uptake rate]). At the lowest growth rate (at 0.1/hr dilution rate) CCR is absent, as glucose and the other four substrates are utilized fully and simultaneously. At a faster cell growth (0.2/hr) a limited CCR partially inhibiting the consumption of lactate and glycerol is seen (Figure\u00a03B). CCR is more widespread at 0.3/hr when the uptake of galactose and maltose are also partially inhibited (Figure\u00a03B, C). Above this dilution rate there is extensive CCR with predominant (though not exclusive) glucose utilization. Indeed, the utilization of maltose, glycerol and galactose is limited and lactate is not utilized at all at growth rate at and above 0.4/hr (Figure\u00a03B).",
                        "The substrate consumption rate compared to total carbon uptake ratio is calculated to describe the percent contribution of each substrates\u2019 uptake to the total carbon uptake along growth rate increase. As shown in Figure\u00a03C, the substrate uptake ratio curves start to diverge after growth rate 0.2/hr, showing that the glucose consumption ratio increases as the growth rate accelerates and it becomes the dominantly utilized substrate. In contrast, as the growth rate increases the substrate consumption ratio of lactate and galactose decreases while that of maltose and glycerol only display a slight change (Figure\u00a03C). This pattern supports the notion that CCR is inactive in slow growing cells but becomes increasingly activated in rapidly growing cells, showing the largest effect at the fastest cell proliferation rate. FBAwMC modeling provides largely similar results and predicts an even more dominant selective glucose consumption at the highest proliferation rates than seen experimentally (Additional file 3: Figure S3).",
                        "Of note, at the lowest proliferation rate (0.1/hr) no secreted acetate is present in the growth medium indicating that metabolism takes place exclusively through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). However, with the initial appearance of CCR there is a concomitant presence of secreted acetate in the growth medium, indicating the appearance of partial aerobic glycolysis in the culture (Figure\u00a03B). At very high growth rates (0.6-0.7/hr) there is a second, much larger phase in acetate secretion that may indicate the down-regulation of OxPhos and a dominance of aerobic glycolysis in the culture (Figure\u00a03B). This has been predicted by FBAwMC and is also seen in a glucose-limited continuous-feed chemostat culture [20].",
                        "Taken together, these results show that the extent of CCR positively correlates with the E. coli cell growth rate, and implies that the activation of CCR in a mixed substrate environment may enable optimal cell growth."

We then focused on the relative gene expression levels of the main substrate transport- and catabolism related genes, metabolic enzyme-encoding genes, and genes encoding osmosensor-, anti-stress-, and cell morphology related proteins.",

The low expression level of ptsG at 0.1/hr coincides with the high expression levels of the glycerol regulon genes (glpKF), the galactose regulon genes (mglABC), the maltose regulon genes (malEFG) and lactate dehydrogenase gene (dld) (Figure\u00a04A). This finding is in agreement with the concomitant utilization of all substrates at this growth rate (Figure\u00a03B, C). The expression level of the transporter genes for all five substrates remained increased at 0.2 and 0.3/hr growth rates indicating active and simultaneous substrate consumption at the slow growing phase. At 0.3/hr there is also an increased expression of the galEKPT whose gene product is responsible for the transformation of galactose to intracellular glucose (Figure\u00a04A). However, with further increase in the culture growth rate the expression levels of most transporter genes have decreased sharply, except that of ptsG\u2019s, whose expression was still maintained at a medium level from 0.3\u2009~\u20090.7/hr, corresponding to the continued glucose consumption at all growth rates (Figure\u00a03B, C). Of particular interest, the gene encoding the alternative glucose transporter, glucokinase (glk), which binds to malT to repress the expression of maltose regulon genes [29], peaks at the highest growth rate, 0.7/hr, when overall glucose uptake rate is at its highest (Figure\u00a03C). These results are consistent with the observed substrate consumption kinetics (Figure\u00a03B, C) and support the notion that CCR is only fully activated at a growth rate above 0.3/hr.",

Most TCA cycle related genes were expressed highly only at the slow growth phase (<0.2/hr) (Figure\u00a04B). In contrast, the expression of glycolysis pathway genes were initially repressed, followed by an initial peak expression at 0.3/hr growth rate and a second peak at the highest growth rate phase (0.7/hr) (Figure\u00a04B). A largely similar transcriptional shift from TCA cycle gene activation to the utilization of glycolysis pathway genes with increasing growth rate was observed previously in a glucose-limited continuous-feed chemostat experiment [20], implying that the selection of the metabolic pathway enzyme activities is more growth rate dependent than substrate dependent.",
                        "The activity of the glycolysis pathway is partially reflected by its metabolic byproduct, acetate, whose extracellular concentration is the consequence of a balance of its rate of secretion (via pta and ackA) and re-uptake (acs). We find that acetate production genes (pta and ackA) are expressed highly between 0.2\u2009~\u20090.4/hr growth rates (Figure\u00a04B). Besides the metabolic switches, osmosensing and cell morphology related genes were also found to be activated differentially along growth rate increase (Additional file 4: Figure S4) indicating their potential involvement in MC optimization of dynamic cell growth."

Therefore, we also wished to examine the cell\u2019s response to transient disruption of CCR. To this end, we induced maltose uptake in a mixed substrate culture with the addition of cAMP (4\u00a0mM) plus maltotriose (200\u00a0\u03bcM) (Additional file 2: Figure S2) at a proliferation rate when maltose uptake is normally inhibited (Figure\u00a01D).",

Simultaneously, the substrate consumption rate of E. coli cells displayed decreased uptake of maltose and glucose, with maltose consumption eventually accelerating (Figure\u00a06C). In contrast, the uptake of glycerol was unaffected. We also found a significant increase in cell volume (Figure\u00a06F) and a slight decrease in cell density (Figure\u00a06E) upon induction of the maltose regulon. Thus, upon inappropriate activation of the maltose regulon E. coli cells expand their cell volume with concomitant slight delay in cell growth, perhaps in part to accommodate extra proteome mass. Indeed, increase in proteome mass by inducing the expression of an exogenous protein yields a similar growth phenotype (Additional file 5: Figure S5).

CCR may provide a similar function to the stringent response regulatory mechanism [32] by being sensitive to the growth needs (i.e., to the availability or the lack of nutrients) of the cell. It may act by turning on/off metabolic pathways by facilitating or repressing the necessary molecules of the pathway to ensure optimal cell growth. Indeed, CCR was evident in a mixed substrate batch chemostat E. coli culture in the form of sequential substrate consumption (Figure\u00a01D) [7]. This behavior was predicted by a flux balance model that takes into account the crowded intracellular milieu of the cell (FBAwMC) without any prior knowledge of CCR [7].

                "In this study, we show that mixed substrate E. coli culture with CCR grows faster and to higher final biomass density than in any of its individual substrates, and that the kinetics of individual substrate uptake is very similar to that predicted by the FBAwMC model (Figure\u00a01). These data suggest that substrate uptake and cell growth relates to macromolecular crowding and that CCR enables optimal cell growth. In turn, we also show that in a mixed substrate culture the extent of CCR\u2019s activation is proportional to the culture\u2019s growth rate while the density of E. coli cells remains essentially unchanged (Figure\u00a03). Furthermore, transiently altered CCR in E. coli cells decreases their rate of proliferation and growth (Figure\u00a06). Transcriptome analyses (Figure\u00a04) also show that strict transcription level regulation of substrate uptake only appears at higher cell growth rates. Taken together, these data indicate that CCR is a regulatory mechanism that is fully active only during rapid cell growth and may exert its effect on cell function in part by enabling cells to maintain a near constant cytoplasmic density and/or by reducing transporter competition for membrane space [33].",
                "However, CCR may not be the only mechanism that may contribute to the maintenance of intracellular MC by reducing the need for increased total protein (enzyme) content of the cell at rapid growth. Indeed, we have shown previously that with increasing cell growth there is a switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to a \u201cmixed OxPhos with glycolysis\u201d mode both in E. coli[20] and mammalian cells [34] that can be interpreted by the same principle. Temporal separation of metabolic activities (i.e., metabolic oscillations) [35-37] may also contribute to the maintenance of optimal intracellular MC. Thus, at slow growth biomass synthesis rate is low and cell metabolism operates in a \u201csubstrate limited\u201d mode, in which multiple substrate catabolism pathways are used through OxPhos to maximize substrate uptake and metabolic yield (Figure\u00a07). Yet, when cells are growing rapidly the biomass production rate is significantly higher, which with the same metabolic regime would require higher catalytic proteome content with subsequent increase in MC. To counter this need and to maintain a near constant MC level, bacterial cells initially increase their cell volume to accommodate the extra biomass production and, simultaneously, cell metabolism is reorganized in part to maintain a physiologically optimal MC."

                "MC is a biophysical constraint and cell metabolism has to adapt to this fundamental constraint. In rapidly growing cells, CCR and/or the switch to \u201cmixed OxPhos with glycolysis\u201d mode is activated to supply ATP production and substrate catabolism with less MC variation (Figure\u00a07). Additional regulatory mechanisms of cell metabolism have likely developed in response to the need for maintaining intracellular MC at an optimal level. Uncovering the genes, proteins and pathways involved in the detection and regulation of MC is an important step for the understanding of the system-level regulation of cell metabolism."
