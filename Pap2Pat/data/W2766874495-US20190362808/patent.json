    "abstract": "A system is provided that considers allele fraction shifts as a function of copy number and clonal heterogeneity. The system leverages differences between allele frequencies to differentiate between somatic and normal variants in impure tumor samples. In solid tumors, stromal cells and infiltrating lymphocytes are typically interspersed among the tumor cells. The normal cell contamination in tumors can be leveraged to differentiate somatic from germline variants. We explicitly model allelic copy number and clonal sample fractions so that we can examine how these factors impact the power to detect somatic variants. The system models the copy number alterations, which can also affect the allele frequencies of both somatic and germline variants. The expected allele frequencies can be calculated. The expected allele frequencies for somatic and germline differ with tumor content for different copy number alterations.",

                        "Somatic mutations often drive cancer initiation and progression1. Some known cancer driver events may be targetable with specific drugs. Some known cancer driver events may have prognostic value for the patient. Some somatic variants may indicate an unfavorable response or resistance to drugs or therapies. Discovery of novel cancer drivers could enable scientists to develop models of the cancer driver (cell lines, animal) to better understand its mechanism and discover existing or new drugs that are able to target tumors with that driver. Detection of somatic variants could be used to develop personalized assays to monitor the patient for response to therapy and recurrence.",
                        "The identification of somatic mutations through next generation sequencing has enabled the identification of cancer driver events in individual patient tumor samples2-4. There is also ongoing effort to discover new cancer driver mutations, particularly in non-coding regions5. Although sequencing of tumor-associated cancer gene panels and exomes is starting to be adopted in clinical practice to personalize therapy, there is much to learn about how mutation status correlates with response to therapy. Archival tissue collections represent a rich resource for identifying new driver mutations and clarifying how genomic features relate to clinical outcomes6,7. However, most archival collections do not contain blood samples or other normal tissue from sites distant to the tumor. Without a normal tissue sample for comparison, it is difficult to determine which variants are somatic and which are germline8. Innovative approaches are needed to identify somatic variants when normal tissue is not available.",
                        "Often, histologically normal tissue is available from the tumor sample. For instance, surgeons typically remove a margin of adjacent normal tissue when resecting a tumor, and this normal tissue can undergo DNA sequencing to identify germline variants. However, it is difficult to know if the adjacent normal tissue is truly free of infiltrating tumor cells. Contamination of the adjacent normal tissue with the tumor tissue during processing could also confound interpretation of the results9. Also, even without infiltrating tumor cells, the adjacent tissue may contain somatic mutations. Field cancerization, where molecular alterations are observed in tissue adjacent to the overt cancer, is thought to be an important risk factor for multifocal and recurrent disease10. This phenomenon has been observed in many cancer types including breast11 and prostate12. Even healthy individuals have somatic mutations in normal tissues, and the mutation patterns tend to be similar to those of the cancers arising from that tissue type13. There even appears to be positive selection for cancer driver mutations in normal skin14. Therefore, it is important to consider potential sources of somatic variant contamination when normal tumor-adjacent tissue is used to identify tumor specific somatic variants.",
                        "When tumor-only sequencing data is available, researchers have developed various analytic strategies to distinguish germline and somatic variants. One first step to identifying somatic variants in tumor-only sequencing data is to filter out the germline variants found in population databases. Jones et al., however, showed that filtering alone is not sufficient, as each individual typically has an average of 249 private germline variants not found in the population databases that would be incorrectly classified as somatic in tumor-only sequencing8. The number of private germline variants will vary based on the individuals' ancestry. The private variant rate in a population depends both on how well represented the population is in large scale sequencing projects, as well has the extent to which the population has undergone a recent expansion adding to the diversity of variants15. More recently, Kalatskaya et al. published a machine-learning approach (ISOWN) to classify somatic and germline variants from tumor-only sequencing data50. The ISOWN requires a large training set, and performs best when the training and test datasets are from the same cancer type and patient cohort. In the case of rare cancer types and N of one study, obtaining such training sets may not be practical. The variant allele fraction, which is the fraction of reads supporting a the mutated allele at a given locus, can also help to distinguish somatic from germline variants in impure tumors; the somatic variants should only be present in the tumor cells, leading to a low variant allele fraction, while the germline variants would be present in both the tumor and normal cells in the sample, leading to a variant allele fraction close to 0.5 for heterozygous variants. However, copy number alterations in the tumor can shift both the somatic and germline variant allele fractions, which can lead to considerable overlap in the expected somatic and germline variant allele fractions and greatly reduce the power to detect somatic variants. Thus, there is a need for new bioinformatics methods to call germline and somatic variants from tumor samples with high and predictable specificity."

                        "Next-generation sequencing of tumors is widely used both for the discovery of biologically important somatic variants as well as for personalized treatment based on clinically relevant somatic variants. In both cases, accurate identification of somatic variants is crucial. Ideally, a constitutional DNA sample from the same individual is sequenced in parallel, so that somatic variants can be identified by comparing the tumor to the constitutional sequence. In some cases, the constitutional sample may not be available, such as with many archival samples. Tumor-only sequencing is also frequently used in clinical practice16. Without a matched germline sequence it is difficult to differentiate between private germline variants and somatic variants17. In addition to using variant databases to filter out germline variants, it is also possible to use variant allele frequencies to differentiate between somatic and germline variants18,19.",
                        "Misidentifying germline variants as somatic can be problematic in several ways, depending on the mutation. First, the interpretation of a previously uncharacterized variant would be very different depending on whether it was thought to be somatic or germline. Healthy individuals typically have 130-400 rare non-synonymous germline variants20. Therefore, it is not surprising that a study sequencing a panel of 42 cancer genes in 175 participants uncovered 269 germline missense mutations of unknown significance21. According to ACMG guidelines, missense germline mutations that are rare and have not been functionally characterized should be reported as uncertain or likely benign22. Since tumor suppressors tend to have loss of function mutations through their length, it is unlikely that any specific mutation in a tumor suppressor is well characterized23. Clinical tumor sequencing tests, such as MSK-IMPACT, typically include uncharacterized non-synonymous mutations in known cancer genes in the main body of their report24.",
                        "There are some variants, such as those in BRCA1 and BRCA2 that are known to occur in the germline and affect cancer risk but may also occur as somatic mutations in tumors. A study of tumors with matched normal sequencing in over 1000 individuals identified known pathogenic germline variants in over 2% of the participants25. Jones et al. examined the presence of germline false positives when tumor samples were analyzed without a matched normal sample17. The study used standard somatic variant calling tools designed for matched tumor-normal pairs with unmatched tumor-normal pairs. After filtering out putative germline variants by removing those found in public databases, it was found that an average of 65% of the variants called somatic in the unmatched samples were private germline variants. Additionally, strict filtering removed a small number of mutations that were truly somatic. Most strikingly, they found that \u02dc50% of patients in their cohort would have germline false positives in clinically actionable genes.",
                        "Although many methods have been developed to distinguish germline and somatic variants from tumor-only sequencing data, none of these methods fully address the following issues. A typical individual has an average of 249 private germline variants not found in the population databases8. The number of private germline variants varies based on the individuals' ancestry. The number of private germline variants depends both on how well represented the population is in large-scale sequencing projects and the extent to which the database has undergone a recent expansion adding to the diversity of variants. Further, approaches requiring a large patient cohort from the same cancer type do not work well when the cancer type is rare, and a large patient cohort is unavailable. Finally, copy number alterations in the tumor can shift both the somatic and germline variant allele fractions, causing considerable overlap in the expected somatic and germline variant allele fractions and reduced power to detect somatic variants.",
                        "The present subject matter addresses these issues by providing a new bioinformatics approach. The present subject matter implements a Bayesian tumor-only somatic variant caller that leverages both prior knowledge of population frequencies of germline and cancer mutations, as well as the observed variant allele frequencies. The present subject matter further leverages adjacent normal tissue from tumor biopsies and allows for the determination of the presence of somatic mutations. In some aspects (e.g., LumosVar15), the present subject matter models allelic copy number to determine the expected allelic fractions for somatic and germline variants as well as incorporates population database frequencies to call variants as somatic or germline. In other aspects (e.g., LumosVarMulti), the present subject matter additionally finds the joint probability of somatic and germline mutations across multiple samples (with different tumor content) from the same patient.",
                        "The advent of next-generation sequencing has accelerated the discovery of cancer driver mutations. However, we have now reached a point where most of the common coding driver mutations have already been discovered23. Efforts are now turning to uncover rare and noncoding driver mutations26-28. One prominent example of a noncoding driver mutation is the TERT promoter mutation29. Statistical methods may be used to prioritize somatic noncoding mutations for functional characterization30,31. Germline variants may also contribute to cancer risk and progression32. Different statistical models are required to analyze germline and somatic alterations33. When a filtering approach is used, the false positive rate is much higher for noncoding variants, as most large-scale sequencing projects have focused on coding regions (FIG. 1). The present methods are extremely valuable for discovering novel noncoding variants in unmatched tumor cohorts. As private germline variants are potential false positives in tumor-only somatic variant calling, the number of private germline variants that an individual has would have a direct impact on the calling precision.",
                        "The present subject matter takes into account how the number of private germline variants varies with ancestry and uses a strategy to reduce false positives due to private germline variants in tumor-only somatic mutation calling. The present subject matter uses a model of variant allele frequencies to improve classification of somatic versus germline variants. The present subject matter estimates allelic copy number and clonal sample fractions to model the expected allele frequency distributions of somatic and germline variants. The present subject matter uses a Bayesian framework that integrates the allele frequency model with prior probabilities of somatic or germline calculated from 1000 genomes population and cancer mutations counts from COSMIC. The power to detect somatic variants by the present subject matter has been evaluated. In one approach, the effects of tumor content, copy number, and read depth were systematically examined on simulations. In a second approach, in silico dilutions and downsampling were used to examine effects of tumor content, copy number, and read depth on real patient data. In a third approach, tumor samples of different ancestry were used to evaluate the tumor-only calling approach.",
                        "In one embodiment of the present invention (e.g., LumosVar), allelic fractions of variants in a single sample are used to infer whether the variants are somatic or germline. In another embodiment of the present invention (e.g., LumosVarMulti), allelic fractions of variants in multiple samples are used to infer whether the variants are somatic or germline.",
                        "LumosVarMulti is a software package designed to jointly analyze multiple samples from the same patient. The approach is based on the concept that the allelic fraction of somatic variants, but not germline variants, would be diluted by the presence of normal tissue. Given the allele-specific copy number state and expected tumor fraction of each sample, LumosVarMulti can model the expected allelic fractions of somatic and germline variants. LumosVarMulti estimates allele-specific copy number and tumor sample fractions from the data and uses the model to call somatic and germline variants. LumosVarMulti also detects subclonal events and spatial heterogeneity between samples. The multi-sample approach has the following advantages:\n\n\n- - Improved detection of somatic variants in samples without a matched\n    germline sample available. Allelic fractions from more than one\n    sample can be used. Ideally one would want a high tumor and a low\n    tumor content sample to analyze jointly. In a high tumor content\n    sample alone, it is difficult to tell somatic from germline\n    variants, while in low tumor samples it can be difficult to detect\n    somatic variants at all. By analyzing high and low tumor samples\n    jointly, the high tumor sample allows the detection somatic\n    variants, and the low tumor sample allows the detection and\n    identification of variants that are not germline variants.\n  - Ability to determine whether there is evidence of variants called in\n    multiple samples from the same patient. In a typical workflow, one\n    would find somatic variants in each sample independently and then go\n    back to the raw data to look for whether there is evidence of any\n    variants that were called in one sample in the other samples.\n    LumosVarMulti looks at all of the samples jointly and determines\n    which ones have evidence of the variant.\n  - Greater sensitivity in detecting low allelic fraction variants that\n    are present in more than one sample. Finding a small number of reads\n    supporting a variant in more than one sample from the same patient\n    would give more confidence that the variant is a true variant than\n    finding the same number of reads in a single sample.\n  - Estimation of the fraction of each sample containing the variant.\n    The multi-sample approach provides a tool that integrates the\n    allelic fractions estimation with the variant calling step.\n  - Group somatic point mutation and copy number variants that show\n    similar patterns across samples into clones. The multi-sample\n    approach provides a tool that integrates analysis of both point\n    mutations and copy number variants.\n  - When a normal sample is available, the multi-sample approach can\n    also take the normal sample as input and provide additional output.\n  - Identify germline copy number variants. The multi-sample approach\n    provides a tool that finds germline and somatic copy number variants\n    in the same analysis.\n  - Identify variants whose allelic fraction does not fit well into a\n    heterozygous or homozygous model. These could be somatic variants\n    that are not specific to the tumor or germline copy number variants\n    that were missed by the copy number model.\n  - Identify rare (for example, \u22641E-6, \u22641E-5, \u22641E-4, or \u22641E-3, etc.)\n    and/or non-coding variants."

The first step analyzes a set of unmatched controls to obtain position quality scores and average exon read depths for the copy number analysis. The second step calculates position quality scores of a candidate variant position in the tumor sample, which takes into account both the quality scores from the unmatched controls as well as quality metrics from the tumor sample such as mapping quality scores and strand bias. The third step estimates the allelic copy number and clonal sample fractions. For purposes of the single-sample strategy, it is assumed that (1) each sample contains different proportions of each clonal variant group; (2) subsets of variants occur in the same fraction of the cells in the sample due to clonal expansions; and (3) at most one variant group has a copy number alteration in a given segment. Subsets in this single-sample strategy indicate groups of variants that follow a similar pattern across the samples from that patient. There are a fixed number of these subsets that have the same sample fraction, and each variant (mutation or copy number) is assumed to belong to one of these subsets. The user may select any positive integer number of subsets. In the results presented here, three subsets were used. In an unrelated training dataset, a selected quantity of three subsets was found to work well for most samples. An expectation maximization approach is used to find the clonal sample fractions that best explain the data and assign the most likely copy number state to each segment and sample fraction to each variant. The fourth step finds the posterior probability that each candidate variant is somatic, germline heterozygous, or homozygous based on the expected allelic fractions for somatic and germline variants which takes into account the allelic copy number and clonal sample fractions. The somatic and heterozygous germline variants are then used as input to the third step. The caller iterates between the third and the fourth step until the result converges (FIG. 4).",

The third step uses an expectation maximization approach to optimize a centering parameter (C), a parameter (W) that controls the spread of the allelic fraction distributions, and the variant group clonal sample fractions (f). The multiple-sample strategy aimed to maximize the following sum of likelihoods: 1) the likelihood of the exon read depth, given the sample fraction and centering parameters; 2) the likelihood of the heterozygous variant B allele read depth, given the sample fractions and W parameter; 3) the likelihood of the somatic variant B allele read depth, given the sample fractions and W parameter; 4) the likelihood of observing at most the number of heterozygous positions detected in each segment; and 5) the likelihood of observing the number of somatic calls in known germline variant positions. The fourth step finds the posterior probability that each candidate variant is somatic, germline heterozygous, or homozygous based on the expected allelic fractions for somatic and germline variants which takes into account the allelic copy number and clonal sample fractions. The product of the conditional probabilities across the set of samples gives the joint probability of each variant type, given all the samples' data. The caller iterates between steps three and four (including the steps of (a) modeling to find a copy number state estimate of the segments and a tumor-cell fraction of the main and subclonal variant group(s); (b) determining an expected allelic fraction of the candidate variant given both a somatic and a germline model; (c) determining a posterior probability that a candidate variant is somatic, germline heterozygous, or homozygous by calculating the likelihood of the observed allelic counts given the somatic and the germline models; d) repeating steps a through c until the solution converges) (FIG. 5).",

Each position that meets all the PASS criteria is assigned to the trusted training group, and each position that meets at least one of the REJECT criteria is assigned to the non-trusted training group. A quadratic discriminant model, fit separately to the homozygous positions, INDEL positions, and all other positions (including somatic and germline heterozygous variants), is trained on the positions that are assigned to the trusted and non-trusted training groups. The quadratic discriminant model is then used to determine the posterior probability that a variant belongs to the trusted training group (PT). In other embodiments of the single-sample approach, the number of clones is not required as input. Instead the model determines the most likely number of clones which maximizes the likelihood of the data. There is an input parameter for a penalty term for adding an additional clone.

The model starts with segmented read count data and finds the most likely allelic copy number state for each segment given the observed mean exon read depths, the B-allele frequencies of the germline heterozygous variants in each segment, and the clonal and subclonal sample fractions. Using an expectation maximization approach, the clonal and subclonal sample fractions are found that maximize the probability of the observed mean exon read depths, germline heterozygous B-allele frequencies, as well as somatic variant B-allele frequencies. Also included are prior probabilities of copy number states and sample fractions to favor solutions more diploid copy number segments and intermediate sample fractions. The model assumes that at most one clone can have a copy number alteration in a given segment, and the rest of the tumor cells, as well as the normal cells, are diploid in that segment (see FIG. 8 for key notation used in the model).

The 1000 genomes project found more novel variants in populations of African ancestry compared to those of European ancestry20. We would also expect there to be differences in the number of private germline variants between populations of different ancestry. We first sought to examine the dependence of private germline variation on ancestry independent of prior databases by utilizing 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data on 26 different populations (FIG. 9A). In this analysis, for each of the 2503 individuals, germline variants were counted as private if the variant was found in no other individual within phase 3 of 1000 Genomes. FIG. 10A shows the distribution of missense variants unique to each individual across the 26 different cohorts. Populations such as Bengali from Bangladesh (BEB) show a significant number of private and rare variants due to both the uniqueness of this population within 1000 Genomes and rapid recent population expansion. In particular, for the BEB population, there is considerable evidence the ability to precisely distinguish germline and somatic variation would require significantly greater numbers of sequenced individuals than the Finnish population. Evident from the violin plots, admixed populations show a bimodal distribution such as in Americans of African Ancestry in the southwest United States (ASW) indicating a high degree of variability. As expected, some populations show a smaller number of unique variants consistent with their geographic isolation such the Puerto Rico participants (PUR).",
                                "The analysis is extended by utilizing an additional set of 578 exome sequenced tumor/normal sets not previously included in existing databases. To obtain high quality variant calls, strict thresholds were used (increasing marginally false negatives), by excluding genes in highly homologous and paralogous regions, requiring greater than 20\u00d7 coverage and that they were called by two different germline variant callers (GATK Haplotype Caller and FreeBayes). In this analysis, we limited to single nucleotide variants that have a defined impact on protein transcription or translation, and not found in Phase 3 of 1000 Genomes Phase 3, ExAc 3.0, ESP6500, or ARIC 5600 cohorts. Overall, we find approximately 100 to 200 private variants per individual. We then overlaid ancestry by PCA on common coding variants ascertained from exome sequencing of germline. These are summarized in FIGS. 10B and 10C which show there are significantly greater challenges in removing germline false-positives for many populations of non-European ancestry. First, shown in FIG. 10B, the number of private putatively functional variants for each individual are plotted in a bubble graph (FIG. 10B) for the 2nd and 3rd principal components to distinguish non-African samples. The number of private variants for each individual is shown both by color and by size In FIG. 10B, and the locations of individuals from 1000 Genomes are shown for orientation. Importantly, this resolution of ancestry shows that even within a European ancestry cohort, there are many individuals who still will have a high number of private variants that would result in a higher number of false positives when detecting somatic variants in tumor only samples by filtering. This effect is shown in the 3 areas of FIG. 10B by grouping individuals heuristically, sectioning off those that cluster near European 1000 Genomes (EUR) for one cluster, those near African 1000 Genomes (AFR) individuals for a second cluster, and those near Eastern and Southern Asian individuals in 1000 Genomes (SAS/EAS). Examining the mean number of missense variants separating into three approximate groups, FIG. 10B shows individuals clustering with those of European ancestry with a mean of 101 private missense variants, individuals clustering or admixed with individuals of African ancestry with a mean of 108 missense variants, and those clustering with individuals of South or East Asian ancestry show a mean of 117 missense variants. A 1-way ANOVA analysis between these groups shows significant differences in the number of private variants (p<0.003). These results are overall consistent both within 1000 Genomes populations and within individuals not included with existing databases, showing that individuals of non-European ancestry have greater number of private variants per individual. Still, the wide distribution of individuals of Caucasian ancestry indicates that ancestry alone, as driven by common variation, does not explain all of the variation. Likely admixture with individuals from populations that have recently undergone rapid expansions indicates there is considerably heterogeneity within populations. Taken together, these results are consistent with a lack of diversity being a major but not the exclusive factor in the higher number of private variants for individuals of non-European descent. Additional population factors may also affect the number of private variants identified. For example, in populations have undergone recent expansions, a larger number of variants may be present only within the most recent generations.",
                                "The observation that most non-hypermutated cancers have approximately the same number of somatic mutations (\u02dc100) as private germline variants has significant implications towards using tumor only sequencing in precision medicine. In FIG. 10C, the European group 1 would have an approximate 50% false discovery rate with filtering alone, whereas the African group would have over a 70% false discovery rate. The results shown in FIGS. 10A-10C suggest filtering-based approaches are substantially more effective for European American individuals. Notably, the results show that the number of private variants is dependent on ancestry. Underlying these differences are undersampling of some populations within databases along with population-specific characteristics, such as admixture or populations that have recently undergone rapid expansions. Since using databases does not appear sufficient to filter germline variants from tumor-only somatic variant calls, we examine integrating variant allele frequency information.",

                                "Since somatic variants will only occur in tumor cells, but germline variants will occur in all cells, we can leverage differences in allele frequencies to differentiate between somatic and normal variants in impure tumor samples. In solid tumors, stromal cells and infiltrating lymphocytes are typically interspersed among the tumor cells46,47. The normal cell contamination in tumors can be leveraged to differentiate somatic from germline variants. For example, in a normal diploid region, a heterozygous germline variant should have an allele frequency around 50% while a heterozygous somatic mutation in an impure tumor should have a lower allele frequency. Still, tumors often have many copy number alterations that will affect the expected allele frequencies of both germline and somatic variants. One approach, implemented by Smith et al., is to fit the distribution of allele frequencies of common germline variants in each segment and detect outliers as likely somatic variants19. In the present subject matter, the allelic copy number and clonal sample fractions are modeled in order to examine how these factors impact the power to detect somatic variants. A conceptual overview of the present approach is shown in FIGS. 11A-11L and a more detailed illustration is provided in FIG. 4.",
                                "A key aspect of the present method is modeling the clonal and subclonal allele-specific copy number alterations, which can also affect the allele frequencies of both somatic and germline variants. The expected allele frequencies can be calculated (see methods Eqs. 1 and 3). FIG. 3 illustrates how the expected allele frequencies for somatic and germline differ with tumor content for different copy number alterations. As predicted, the biggest differences in allele frequencies between the somatic and germline variants occur at the lowest tumor content regardless of copy number state. In a normal diploid region, the difference in allele frequencies monotonically decreases as tumor content increases. However, other copy number states result in points of intermediate tumor content where the allele frequencies for somatic and germline variants are similar. Therefore, we would expect copy number alterations to make it more difficult to detect somatic variants based on allele frequencies.",

                                "It was expected that at higher read depth, allele frequency could be measured more precisely, therefore would be better able to detect somatic variants. The read depth required should depend on the tumor content and the copy number state. Simulations were used to examine how the power to detect somatic variants depends on tumor content, mean target coverage, and copy number state. Somatic variants were simulated in eight different copy number states, with sample fraction from 5-95% and mean target coverage from 50 to 3200 with 1000 variants for each condition. Then we found the percentage that would be called somatic using the default thresholds. FIG. 12 shows that the read depth required depends greatly on the sample fraction and copy number state. In a diploid region (N=2, M=1), we would only need 200\u00d7 mean target coverage to detect almost 80% of the somatic variants with a sample fraction of 50%. However, we would need 800\u00d7 mean target coverage to detect a similar proportion of variants with a sample fraction of 75%, and 3200\u00d7 coverage to detect a similar proportion of variants with a sample fraction of 85%. Copy number alterations reduce the power to detect somatic variants in specific ranges of sample fractions. For example copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (N=2, M=0) makes it very hard to detect variants with a sample fraction around 35-40%, while a one copy gain (N=3, M=1) makes it very hard to detect variants with a sample fraction around 50-55%.",
                                "Thus, the sensitivity of the allele frequency strategy is highly dependent on the tumor content, the copy number alteration profile of the sample, as well as the sequencing depth. A minimum sequencing depth of 200-400\u00d7 is needed with even higher depth required for samples with high tumor content.",

The other samples were sequenced to 454\u00d7-1012\u00d7 mean target coverage. A consensus calling approach was used to define true somatic and true germline variants, as consensus calling typically outperforms any individual caller48. Using strict criteria of detection by three out of three somatic variants callers (or two out of two for indels) it was found that each sample had an average of 129 somatic (range 75-196) mutations. Three out of three consensuses calling was used to define germline variants, and considered variants private those that did not appear in dbSNP.

Therefore, the present method adopted a two-tiered approach to variant quality filtering. About 80% of somatic variants and 78% of private germline variants have sufficient quality to call (FIG. 13). A much lower percentage of indels meet the strict quality criteria as they are much more difficult to map. It was found that increasing coverage increased the number of somatic and private germline variants that pass the strict quality criteria (FIG. 14) while changing the tumor content has little effect (FIG. 15).",

In the present approach, some ambiguity was observed in calling segments as a one copy gain in the highest sample fraction or a higher level gain in a lower sample fraction. Though too small to see in the plot, there is also a \u02dc0.2 megabase deletion on chromosome 9 that is detected as a two-copy loss in all but the lowest dilution encompassing CDKN2A.

The power to detect somatic variants was expected to depend on the sample fraction, copy number states, and read depth. Using the sample fraction and copy number state assigned to each variant, we simulated somatic variants and determined the proportion of simulated somatic variants that would be called somatic by our model (FIGS. 19A-19B). These simulations can predict accurately the proportion of somatic variants that can be detected, which indicates that the samples with poor sensitivity have copy number states and sample fractions that are not conducive to detecting somatic variants by allele frequency. As expected, the sensitivity to detect somatic variants increased with coverage (FIGS. 18A-18B). Also consistent with expectations, the detection sensitivity was best at intermediate tumor content, where the somatic variants would generally have the biggest difference in expected allele frequency from the germline variants (FIGS. 18A-18B).

The single-sample approach, LumosVar, can correctly classify most of the private germline variants and has much better positive predictive value (range 67-91%). While there still are some false positive germline variants, many are found in dbSNP (FIG. 12).

                                "LumosVar uses information in addition to databases to help infer what is somatic and what is germline. Specifically, the fraction of reads that show variant can be used to determine whether the variant is somatic or germline. The tumor samples may vary in tumor-cell contents, but the LumosVar approach works best when the sample contains normal tissue and tumor tissue (e.g., the sample is not 100% tumor tissue). If the sample has very little normal tissue (e.g., \u02dc95% tumor and \u02dc5% normal tissue), then the small amount of normal tissue may not justify the cost and effort of performing the LumosVar analysis in some situations.",
                                "There are often logistical reasons why only a tissue sample may be available, but the tumor tissue is often a mixture of tumor and surrounding stromal tissue. The present disclosure demonstrates that a model leveraging deep sequencing to measure differences in allele frequencies between somatic and germline variants could be utilized to call somatic mutations with greater specificity than using population variant frequencies alone. The disclosed allele frequency-based strategy can reduce by \u2154rds the number of false positives. The Bayesian calling strategy described here, along with appropriate sample collection and sequencing depth will enable the more accurate detection of somatic variants when the germline samples are not available.",
                                "The intuitive question moves to what is the accuracy of tumor only sequencing. It turns out accuracy is not the most informative statistical tool since one is assured 99%+ accuracy due to the millions of true negatives\u2014even if one reports zero variants in a hypermutated sample. Positive predictive value is a natural tool, but it brings forth a different problem. In the case of tumor only sequencing, the positive predictive value for variants called somatic will depend on the number of true mutations. The number of mutations or mutational burden varies by cancer type. Hypermutated phenotypes often seen in melanomas, bladder, and lung cancer can be 100-times higher than the mutational burden scene in lymphomas. Recent data shows the importance of mutational burden as it correlates to the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapies57. Given the dependence of mutational burden on cancer type and the relationship between tumor-only false positives and ancestry, a more complex picture appears. In some cases, for some ancestries and some cancers can stack in favor of a low false discovery rate. For example, cutaneous melanomas have a higher a mutational burden and are more frequently found in individuals of European ancestry. However, acral melanomas have a low mutational burden and are much more frequently found in individuals of non-European descent (as compared to cutaneous). In this example, a melanoma of a person with non-European decent would show a very low positive predictive value and a European-American would have a higher positive predictive value.",
                                "We have demonstrated that LumosVar has improved positive predictive value in calling somatic variants compared to database filtering, which is the most commonly used approach with unmatched tumor samples. When analyzing archival samples in a research setting, LumosVar would be of great utility. In addition to calling somatic and germline variants, LumosVar also calls allele-specific copy number and assigns both mutations and copy number alterations to clonal sample fractions.",
                                "Overall, the results shown herein provide insight into how experimental design and sample characteristics can have a large impact on the sensitivity of the allele frequency based tumor only somatic variant detection. Moderate tumor content is optimal and could be achieved through strategic sectioning of FFPE blocks. High sequencing depth is also critical to sensitivity, and as the cost of sequencing continues to decline, high depth sequencing is becoming more common practice. The researcher cannot control the copy number alterations of a tumor but can be aware that cancer types that stray farther from diploid will be less amenable to this approach. Since different copy number alterations have tumor content where the somatic and germline variants are most difficult to distinguish, it could be valuable to sequence different sections of the same tumor that may have different tumor content.",
                                "The number of germline false positives detected in tumor only sequencing is dependent on the individual's ancestry. Our Bayesian framework, which integrates modeling copy number and clonality, can greatly reduce the number of germline false positives. The sensitivity of our approach depends on tumor purity, coverage, and copy number alterations. With appropriate experimental design, our approach has the potential to be useful for somatic variant calling when matched normal tissue is not available, particularly in individuals of non-European ancestry.",
                                "**Example 10. Simulation of the Multi-Sample Joint Approach**",
                                "Simulations were performed to determine how the tumor purity and copy number states affect the power to detect somatic variants in the joint approach, and how the power compares to the single-sample lumosVar (FIGS. 21A-21B). As previously shown, the single sample approach performs best with a sample of intermediate tumor purity for variants in diploid regions, but copy number variation leads to situations where the expected somatic and germline allele fractions are similar, making it difficult to classify somatic variants using a single sample15. The joint approach mitigates this limitation, and only provides poor detection when both samples fall into a range where the expected somatic and germline allele fractions are very similar. The joint approach generally only requires low-to-moderate coverage when one sample has low tumor content and the other sample has moderate-to-high tumor content. Simulation studies suggest that a multi-sample approach should be more powerful than a single-sample approach, even if there is a small difference in tumor content between the two samples. For example, in a region of copy neutral LOH (N=2, M=0), our simulations show that analyzing a 25% tumor and 45% tumor sample jointly would require each to have 400\u00d7 coverage to detect at least 80% of the variants. However, a single sample with 35% tumor in a region of copy neutral LOH would not enable the detection of 80% of the somatic variants even at 3200\u00d7 coverage.",
                                "Evaluation of a set of GBM samples with low tumor content (from NE biopsies) and high tumor content (from CE resections) further demonstrates the sensitivity and precision of the joint approach. Practical application of this approach to a set of FFPE breast and prostate samples shows the feasibility of this approach with typical archival samples.",
                                "Compared to the single sample lumosVar analysis, the joint approach requires lower total sequencing coverage to obtain the same sensitivity. Based on the simulation studies, if the adjacent normal tissue has less than 25% tumor cell contamination, and the tumor sample has at least 55% percent tumor cells, then 200\u00d7 total coverage (100\u00d7 for each sample) is only required to detect 80% of the somatic variants that are in all of the tumor cells. However, higher coverage would be desirable to detect low abundance sub-clonal variants. Due to the large difference in prior probabilities of homozygous reference versus somatic variants in this model, lumosVar tends to be less sensitive to low abundance variants compared to other somatic variant callers. LumosVarMulti also has more stringent quality filtering than most paired somatic variant callers because the same artifacts often appear in the tumor and germline sample, so paired callers can eliminate those artifacts.",
                                "**Example 11. Evaluation Dataset of the Multi-Sample Joint Approach**",
                                "To evaluate LumosVarMulti, a glioblastoma dataset was used, where enhancing (high tumor content) and non-enhancing (low tumor content) samples were available for each patient, as well as the matched normal sample to define the true somatic variants. Results showed that both sensitivity and positive predictive value were improved by analyzing the high tumor and low tumor jointly compared to analyzing the samples individually or in silico pooling of the two samples. Finally, this multi-sample joint approach was applied to a set of breast and prostate archival FFPE tumor samples where normal samples were not available for germline sequencing.",
                                "It was hypothesized that the patterns of allelic fractions across samples of different purities would be more informative than any individual sample in distinguishing somatic from germline variants. To test this hypothesis we evaluate sequencing two samples of different purities from the same patient and calling the variants using the joint approach, compared to sequencing one sample at twice the sequencing depth and with a tumor purity that is the average of the two samples. First, simulations were used to systematically evaluate the effects of tumor purity and copy number states for the two approaches. Next, a set of glioblastoma (GBM) patient samples for which sequencing data was available for the contrast-enhancing region (CE, the high fraction of tumor cells) and non-enhancing region (NE, the low fraction of tumor cells) biopsies, as well as peripheral blood sample sequencing data, were evaluated to establish the truth. Finally, the method was applied to an archival cohort of breast and prostate samples where formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections from the tumor biopsies or resections were the only tissues available.",
                                "The potential benefit of sequencing two samples of different purities from the same patient and calling the variants using the joint approach was evaluated. A set of previously collected and de-identified exome data from seven recurrent lioblastoma (GBM) patients was used (FIG. 22, FIG. 23). Each patient dataset contained exome sequencing data for contrast-enhancing (CE, high fraction of tumor cells) region biopsies, non-enhancing (NE, low fraction of tumor cells) region biopsies, and peripheral blood sample (germline) sequencing data to establish truth. The acquisition and sequencing of these samples was previously described58. The consensus of three comparative somatic variant callers (SEURAT40, STRELKA41, and MUTECT42) was used to define the true somatic variants. The number of likely germline false positives were determined based on the number of heterozygous variants called by HaplotypeCaller37 that were not found in dbSNP44. The percent tumor cells of total cells in the sample was determined by the log 2 fold change of a large chromosome segment appearing to have loss of one copy (typically chromosome 10). Thus, the results further demonstrated the sensitivity and precision of the joint approach.",
                                "The joint approach methods were applied to archival breast cancer and prostate samples, where only FFPE tissue sections from biopsies or surgical tumor resections were available (FIG. 24). For eight of the breast cancer patients, whole slides with adjacent normal tissue were not available, so adjacent normal areas were macro-dissected from tumor-containing slides. For the remaining patients, DNA was isolated from whole slides of adjacent normal tissue. Where dissection was used to obtain the normal tissue samples, most of the somatic variants called were detected in both the adjacent normal and the tumor samples. For the patients where adjacent normal tissue was obtained from separate slides, most patients still had a few somatic variants detected in the normal tissue. Thus, practical application of this approach to a set of FFPE breast and prostate samples shows the feasibility of this approach with typical archival samples. It is worth noting that one somatic variant detected in the adjacent normal tissue was a known PI3-kinase activating mutation.",
                                "We also analyzed the archival tissue (FIG. 25). Two approaches were used: (1) a filtering strategy (unmatched plus filtering\u2014UPF) where standard somatic variant calling tool(s) were used against an unmatched reference, and variants found in dbSNP were excluded as likely germline; and (2) a strategy (adjacent normal as reference\u2014ANR) that used the tumor-adjacent normal sample as the normal reference in standard somatic variant calling tools. Using the UPF strategy, we found that most of the variants called using the filtering strategy have variant allele fractions around 50% in both the low- and high-tumor-content samples, suggesting that most are private germline variants. Using the ANR approach, we are only identifying variants with allele fractions in the adjacent normal sample that are at or very close to zero. The variants called by lumosVar generally have higher allele fractions in the tumor samples and low allele fractions in the adjacent normal samples, as expected.",
                                "Mutations called by any of the three approaches were compared against the Cancer Hotspots database, which reports recurrent mutations in 11,119 tumor samples51. A total of 28 hotspot mutations were called including eight mutations with in vitro or in vivo validation (level-3), two mutations detected in the Cancer Hotspots dataset that were previously reported (level-2), and eighteen mutations that were novel in the Cancer Hotspots dataset (level-1). Of the ten level-3 and level-2 mutations, all were called in the UNF approach, eight were called by LumosVarMulti, and only six were called in the ANR approach (FIG. 26). The two level-2 and level-3 mutations missed by lumosVarMulti had low allele fractions in the tumor sample (5-6%), while the four level-3 hotspots variants missed by the ANR approach had moderate allele fraction in the tumor (17-35%) and low allele fractions in the adjacent tissue (2-16%). The level-1 hotspots were called only in the UNF approach. These include the same APOBR mutation called in 13 patients and the same DHRS4 mutation called in four patients (FIG. 25). Putative mutations that are common within a dataset, but not know to be common in cancer, are suggestive of alignment artifacts52.",
