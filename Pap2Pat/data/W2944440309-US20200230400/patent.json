                        "According to one aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a peripheral nerve electrode array comprising:\n\n\n- - a first pair of electrodes, the first pair of electrodes comprising\n    two first electrodes located proximate each other along a\n    longitudinal axis of the electrode array;\n  - a second pair of electrodes, the second pair of electrodes\n    comprising two second electrodes located proximate to each other\n    along the longitudinal axis of the electrode array; and\n  - a third pair of electrodes, the third pair of electrodes comprising\n    two third electrodes located locate proximate to each other along\n    the longitudinal axis of the electrode array,\n  - wherein the second pair of electrodes is located between the first\n    and third pairs of electrodes and wherein the first, second and\n    third pairs of electrodes are spaced from each other along the\n    longitudinal axis of the electrode array.",
                        "The first, second and third pairs of electrodes (also referenced herein as first, second and third electrode pairs) may each be selectively operable as a pair of stimulation electrodes, for applying an electrical stimulation signal to the peripheral nerve, and/or as a pair of monitoring electrodes, for monitoring (e.g. recording) an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve in response to an applied electrical stimulation signal. The electrode array may comprise or may be connected to one or more electrical stimulation devices that generate the electrical stimulation signals to apply, via the respective pair(s) of electrodes, to the peripheral nerve. The electrode array may comprise or may be connected to one or more monitoring devices that receive, from the respective pair(s) of electrodes, the electrical response signals and process the electrical response signals.",
                        "In one embodiment the first pair of electrodes is a pair of stimulation electrodes for applying an electrical stimulation signal to the peripheral nerve and the second and third pairs of electrodes are pairs of monitoring electrodes for monitoring an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve in response to the electrical stimulation signal applied by the first pair of electrodes.",
                        "The provision of at least three pairs of electrodes, which can provide for a pair of stimulation electrodes and two pairs of monitoring electrodes, for example, can have a number of advantages. The present disclosure has recognised that it is desirable to have the ability to place a pair of monitoring electrodes as close as possible, along the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve, to the pair of stimulation electrodes, in order to precisely monitor the effects of the electrical stimulation at the peripheral nerve based on the electrical response signal, including for a \u2018C-fibre\u2019 response, for example. However, the closer the pair of monitoring electrodes is to the pair of stimulation electrodes, the greater risk that an electrical stimulation artefact will dominate the electrical response signal, including any \u2018A- delta fibre\u2019 response. Accordingly, if only one pair of monitoring electrodes is provided in a fixed relationship relative to the pair of stimulating electrodes, the two pairs of electrodes may need to be located relatively far apart to reduce the risk that no suitable electrical response signals will be monitored and/or to allow certain fibre responses to be picked up. By providing a further pair of monitoring electrodes (the third pair of electrodes), spaced further along the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve from the pair of stimulating electrodes (the first pair of electrodes) than the other pair of monitoring electrodes (the second pair of electrodes), this problem can be negated. In particular, one pair of monitoring electrodes (the second pair of electrodes) can be located relatively closely to the first pair of electrodes, at a position that may be at greater risk of recording a stimulation artefact, of a size and duration that would significantly affect the quality of all or part of the recorded response, but that would otherwise provide for precise monitoring of the effects of the electrical stimulation, including for \u2018C-fibre\u2019 response, for example. If there is such a stimulation artefact, the further pair of monitoring electrodes (the third pair of electrodes) can provide a suitable backup or substitute, ensuring that monitoring of the response to electrical stimulation can still be successfully achieved, including for \u2018A-delta fibre\u2019 responses, for example. The electrical neural response signals may be measured as electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs), for example. ECAPs may be measured for specific time periods following electrical stimulation, for example, such as for at least 3 ms, at least 5 ms, at least 7 ms, at least 10 ms, or at last 12 ms, although the particular time period may be varied depending on the distance between stimulating electrodes and recording electrodes. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the arrangement may allow recording of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) responses from both slow and fast conducting fibres without obstruction by the stimulation artefact.",
                        "In accordance with the above, in one embodiment, the first pair of electrodes is a pair of stimulation electrodes for applying an electrical stimulation signal to the peripheral nerve; the second pair of electrodes is a pair of monitoring electrodes for monitoring a first electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve in response to the electrical stimulation signal applied by the first pair of electrodes; and the third pair of electrodes is another pair of monitoring electrodes for monitoring a second electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve in response to the electrical stimulation signal applied by the first pair of electrodes. The third pair of electrodes can be configured to monitor the second electrical response signal if all or a relevant part of the first electrical response signal is dominated by an electrical stimulation artefact, for example.",
                        "Nevertheless, the different pairs of electrodes may be selectively operable in different configurations. For example, the second (middle) pair of electrodes may be selectively operable as a pair of stimulation electrodes for applying electrical stimulation signals to the peripheral nerve and the first and third pairs of electrodes may be selectively operable as pairs of monitoring electrodes for monitoring an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve. The first and third pairs of electrodes may therefore monitor the electrical response in different directions (e.g. the electrical response in both afferent and efferent directions, rather than the electrical response in an afferent or efferent direction only).",
                        "As another example, at least two of the first, second and third pairs of electrodes may be selectively operable as pairs of stimulation electrodes for applying electrical stimulation signals to the peripheral nerve and the remaining one of the first, second and third pairs of electrodes may be selectively operable as a pair of monitoring electrodes for monitoring an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve. By providing multiple electrical stimulation locations, the direction of electrical activity may be more precisely controlled.",
                        "Further, the first, second and third pairs of electrodes may all be selectively operable as pairs of monitoring electrodes for monitoring an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve. In this and other arrangements described herein, pairs of monitoring electrodes may be used to monitor either evoked neural responses, following application of an electrical stimulation signal and/or spontaneous (e.g. natural/passive) neural activity of the nerve.",
                        "Still further, the provision of first, second and third electrode pairs does not preclude the provision of fourth, fifth or yet further electrode pairs, whether for applying electrical stimulation signals and/or monitoring electrical responses. As one example, five electrode pairs may be provided. The central (e.g. third) pair of electrodes may be a selectively operable as a pair of stimulation electrodes for applying electrical stimulation signals to the peripheral nerve and the remaining four (e.g. first, second, fourth and fifth) electrode pairs may be selectively operable as pairs of monitoring electrodes for monitoring an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve in different directions. The first and second pairs of electrodes may monitor the electrical response in a first direction (e.g. in an afferent direction) and the fourth and fifth pairs of electrodes may monitor the electrical response in a second direction (e.g. in an efferent direction). The approach may provide advantages as set forth above, including to manage stimulation artefacts when monitoring of electrical response signals in two directions.",
                        "The first electrodes may be spaced from each other by a distance a1, the second electrodes may be spaced from each other by a distance a2 and the third electrodes may be spaced from each other by a distance a3. The first and second pairs of electrodes may be spaced from each other by a distance b1 and the second and third pairs of electrodes are spaced from each other by a distance b2. The distances between the electrodes within each pair of electrodes may be substantially equal, i.e. it may be that a1=a2=a3, or they may be different. Similarly, the distances between each pair of electrodes may be substantially equal, i.e. it may be that b1=b2, or they may be different. In general, however, the distances b1, b2 between the different pairs of electrodes may be greater than the distances a1, a2, a3 between the electrodes within each pair of electrodes. For example, the ratio between any one or more of distances a1, a2 and a3 and any one or more of distances b1 and b2 may be between 1:1.5 and 1:4, between 1:1.5 and 1:3, or about 1:2.5. In another example, the ratio between any one or more of distances a1, a2 and a3 and any one or more of distances b1 and b2 may be about 1:5.",
                        "Additionally, or alternatively, distances between pairs of electrodes may be set based on a type or property of fibres for which recording is desired. Distances b1, b2 between different pairs of electrodes may be determined as a function of a conduction velocity of fibres that can be recorded at particular latencies (or conduction properties). Merely as one example, to record responses with \u2018C-fibres\u2019, a spacing of 5 mm between pairs of electrodes may be used. In this arrangement, at \u22121 m/s conduction velocity, 5 mm spacing provides a latency of \u22125 ms which may be sufficient to ensure that a response is recorded while minimising stimulus artefact.",
                        "The electrodes within each pair of electrodes may be elongated. The direction of elongation of the electrodes may be transverse to the longitudinal axis of the electrode array and therefore to the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve. The electrodes within each pair of electrodes may extend parallel to each other. The electrodes within each pair of electrodes may be positioned side by side along the longitudinal axis of the electrode array and along the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve.",
                        "The first, second and third pairs of electrodes may be in a substantially fixed relationship. The electrode array may comprise a support that substantially maintains the relative orientation and/or location of the pairs of electrodes, that is, with respect to each other. The relative orientation and/or location of the pairs of electrodes may therefore be substantially pre-defined, rather than being selected by a surgeon. The support may comprise resiliently flexible material, which may allow for slight relative movement of the pairs of electrodes, but may nevertheless substantially maintain the relative locations and orientations.",
                        "The support may comprise multiple branches at a distal end. For example, the support may comprise, at a distal end, a first branch that supports the first pair of electrodes, a second branch that supports the second pair of electrodes and a third branch that supports the third pair of electrodes. The branches may ensure that contact between the electrode array and the peripheral neve is minimised, the contact being made only at or immediately adjacent each pair of electrodes, rather than contact occurring across the gaps between the pairs of electrodes. The first, second and third branches may converge together towards a proximal end of the electrode array. The support may be provided by a lead, e.g. a stiff lead. The branches may be branched portions of the lead. The branch portions may be rigid or semi-rigid such that a constant spacing and/or relative orientation between the electrode mounting devices is substantially maintained.",
                        "Each branch may comprise an electrode mounting device that mounts to the peripheral nerve, bringing a respective pair of electrodes into electrical contact with the peripheral nerve. Through use of the branches or otherwise, the electrode array may, in general, include one or more electrode mounting devices, each electrode mounting device comprising at least one of the pairs of electrodes and being adapted to mount to the peripheral nerve to electrically interface the pair of electrodes with the peripheral nerve. For example, the electrode array may comprise a first electrode mounting device comprising the first electrode pair, a second electrode mounting device comprising the second electrode pair and a third electrode mounting device comprising the third electrode pair, wherein each of the first, second and third electrode mounting devices is adapted to mount to the peripheral nerve to electrically interface the first, second and third pair of electrodes, respectively, with the peripheral nerve.",
                        "Each electrode mounting device may be adapted to clamp to the peripheral nerve. Each electrode mounting device may be adapted to form a loop around the peripheral nerve.",
                        "Each electrode mounting device may comprise a first wing and a second wing that are adapted to extend on opposite sides of the peripheral nerve and to be engageable with each other to form the loop. The first wing may comprise a first cuff portion and the second wing may comprise a second cuff portion, the first and second cuff portions being engageable with each other to form the loop. Moreover, the first wing may comprise a first elongate extension portion that extends from the first cuff portion and the second wing may comprise a second elongate extension portion that extends from the second cuff portion.",
                        "The electrode mounting device as described above may be used in various peripheral nerve electrode arrays to mount to and electrically interface one or more electrodes with the peripheral nerve.",
                        "Thus, according to one aspect of the present disclosure, a peripheral nerve electrode array is provided comprising:\n\n\n- - an electrode mounting device comprising one or more electrodes, the\n    electrode mounting device adapted to mount to a peripheral nerve to\n    electrically interface the electrodes with the peripheral nerve;\n  - the electrode mounting device comprising a first wing and a second\n    wing, the first wing comprising a first cuff portion and a first\n    elongate extension portion extending from the first cuff potion, and\n    the second wing comprising a second cuff portion and a second\n    elongate extension portion extending from the second cuff portion,\n  - the first and second cuff portions being engageable with each other\n    to form a loop around the peripheral nerve.",
                        "In any aspect described herein, the first and second cuff portions may comprise first and second ends, the first ends being connected to each other and the second ends being movable into engagement with each other to form the loop. The electrode mounting device may comprise a pivot such as a hinge or bearing, e.g. a flexible bearing, that connects the first ends of the cuff portions together. The pivot may allow for relative rotation of the first and second cuff portions.",
                        "The first and second elongate extension portions may extend from the second ends of the first and second cuff portions, respectively. The length of each elongate extension portion may be greater than the length of each first and second cuff portion. Each elongate extension portion may be an elongate tab. In this regard, each elongate extension portion may be substantially flat strip of material. However, other configurations of the elongate extension portions are possible.",
                        "Each cuff portion may have an inner surface with a semi-elliptical, semi-oblong or semi-rectangular profile to contact an outer surface of the peripheral nerve. Related to this, the loop formed by the first and second cuff portions may have an inner surface with an elliptical, oblong or rectangular profile to contact an outer surface of the peripheral nerve.",
                        "The electrode array in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure may be shaped to improve an interface characteristic between the nerve and the electrode array. In one form, one or more of the electrode mounting devices of the electrode array are configured to shape the nerve, such as to flatten the nerve and increase a surface area for contacting with corresponding electrode surfaces. The inner surface(s) may thus press against the nerve causing a compression of the nerve until it has completely reshaped. The cuff portions may be arranged to reshape the nerve, while also ensuring that a maximum force and/or maximum pressure applied to the nerve remains under a predetermined limit. For instance, the cuff portions may be shaped and configured (e.g. by material selection) to apply a pressure to the nerve, where the pressure is maintained under a maximum of 30 mm Hg (approx. 4 kPa).",
                        "The elongate extension portions may provide assistance to a surgeon in positioning the electrode mounting device relative to the peripheral nerve, and particularly to assist the surgeon with positioning the first and second cuff portions at appropriate positions on opposite sides of the peripheral nerve, prior to engaging the second ends of the first and second cuff portions with each other to form the loop around the peripheral nerve. Due to their length, the first and second elongate extension portions may be relatively easy to feed either side of the peripheral nerve in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve. Moreover, the first and second elongate extension portions may be relatively easy to take hold of once they have been fed either side of the peripheral nerve. By taking hold of and moving the first and second elongate extension portions, a surgeon may move the first and second cuff portions to suitable positions either side of the peripheral nerve and may move the second ends of the first and second cuff portions into engagement to form the loop around the peripheral nerve.",
                        "All or part of each of the first and second wings may be flexible. In some embodiments, the flexibility of the first and second wings may decrease towards a distal end. By being more rigid towards their distal ends, the first and second wings may be more easily or reliably fed, distal ends first, either side of the peripheral nerve. Advantageously, such arrangements may enhance usability in surgical manipulation and/or implantation.",
                        "The electrode mounting device may include a locking mechanism to secure the first and second wings in the looped configuration. In one embodiment, the locking mechanism is provided in part by an opening in one of the first and second wings, e.g. the first wing. The other wing, e.g. the second wing, may be movable to extend at least partly through the opening. Moving the second wing through the opening may bring the second ends of the first and second cuff portions into engagement to form the loop and may assist in securing the loop configuration. At least the second elongate extension portion of the second wing may be flexible to assist in positioning it towards and extending it through the opening. A distal end of the second extension portion may be extended through the opening.",
                        "The second elongate extension portion may have a proximal end connected to the second end of the cuff portion, and an opposite distal end. The width of the second elongate extension portion may taper towards its distal end. The distal end of the second elongate extension portion may be narrower than the opening of the first wing enabling it to be readily inserted through the opening. The proximal end of the second extension portion may be wider than the second end of the second cuff portion and wider than the opening of the first wing. The proximal end of the second extension portion may therefore define a shoulder at a transition between the proximal end of the second elongate extension portion and the second end of the cuff portion. The material forming the shoulder may be deformable in order to extend through the opening. The natural shape of the shoulder may be deformed to fit the shoulder through the opening and may return to its natural shape once through the opening to secure the first and second cuff portions in the looped configuration.",
                        "In addition or as an alternative to using the arrangement described above, including the shoulder to secure the first and second cuff portions in the looped configuration, securing of the first and second wings in the looped configuration may be achieved using sutures, staples and/or other locking mechanisms.",
                        "In some embodiments, at least part of the first and/or second extension portions of the first and second wings may be removed after the loop is formed. Removal may be achieved by cutting the first and second extension portions, and/or through a manual separation technique. For example, a region of weakness may be formed in the first and/or second elongate extension portions, such as a line of perforations, a tear notch, a score line or otherwise, enabling a user (e.g., surgeon) to remove at least a part of the first and/or second elongate extension portions.",
                        "One or more portions of the electrode array may comprise a biocompatible material, such as a medical grade silicone elastomer. For instance, all or part of the support, such as all or part of the lead, branch, wing and/or cuff, may comprise a silicone elastomer. One or more of the electrodes may comprise a biocompatible material, such as platinum.",
                        "The electrode array may be used for a variety of purposes such as the treatment and/or monitoring of medical conditions. As non-limiting examples, the electrode array may be used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, to treat faecal/urinary incontinence or constipation, to treat urinary incontinence, to effect locomotion, or otherwise. The electrode array may be used with any peripheral nerve for any purposes, including, as non-limiting examples, the vagus nerve (e.g. to treat inflammatory bowel disease), or the sacral nerve stimulation (e.g. for treatment of faecal/urinary incontinence or constipation), the pudendal nerve stimulation (e.g. for treatment of urinary incontinence), the sciatic nerve (e.g. to effect locomotion) or otherwise. The electrode array may be implanted below branches to vital organs (larynx, heart or lungs). The electrode array may be scaled in size as appropriate for the nerve that is stimulated.",
                        "In other aspects provided herein the disclosure relates to stimulation of the vagus nerve for the treatment of or prevention of a chronic inflammatory condition. The vagus nerve is one of twelve cranial nerves, which are nerves that emerge directly from the brain. The right and left cervical vagus nerves emerge from the brain medulla at the jugular foramen, extend via the nodose ganglia into the neck. Each of the left and right vagus nerves branch to form the following (bilaterally): recurrent laryngeal nerve; pharyngeal plexus; pulmonary and cardiac plexuses.",
                        "The left and right vagus nerves course along the esophagus to form the esophageal plexus. The vagus nerves then enter the abdomen (below the diaphragm) as the central abdominal vagus nerves, i.e., the anterior and posterior (FIG. 15). The anterior central abdominal vagus (CAV) nerve then divides into the gastric branch (innervating the stomach), the hepatic branch (innervating the liver, pancreas and duodenum), and the celiac branch (innervating the spleen, duodenum, jejunum, ileus and colon up to the left colic flexure). The posterior CAV nerve divides into the gastric vagus nerve (innervating the stomach) and the celiac vagus nerve (innervating the spleen, duodenum, jejunum, ileus and colon (up to the left colic flexure). Vagus nerve stimulation has traditionally been used in the treatment of refractive epilepsy and depression. In order to carry out such treatment, typically, a stimulating device is surgically implanted under the skin of the chest, and a wire is threaded under the skin connecting the device to the left cervical branch of the vagus nerve. The right cervical branch of the vagus nerve is generally not stimulated unless therapy is specifically directed to treatment of heart failure, as this branch of the vagus nerve carries fibres that innervate the pacemaker nodes of the heart. The device sends electrical signals along afferent and efferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Afferent stimulation is relayed through the brainstem, which then sends signals to other areas in the brain, as well as back into the peripheral nervous system. More recently, vagus nerve stimulation, acting through both afferent and efferent pathways has been proposed as a potentially promising approach for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (reviewed in Bonaz et al 2017, J Intern Med, 282(1):46-63). However, to date vagus nerve stimulation regimens for treatment of IBD have been based on those adopted for treatment of other conditions such as epilepsy, which are not particularly well suited for treatment of IBD and entail off-target stimulation associated with a number of side effects including, voice changes, hoarseness, throat pain, cough, headaches, chest pain, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. The present inventors have found that stimulating the CAV nerve, particularly at a site below the cardiac branches and above the hepatic-celiac branches, is therapeutically effective for treatment of a chronic inflammatory condition such as IBD, but reduces potential off-target stimulation and side effects associated with stimulation of the vagus nerve at other sites. In addition vagus nerve stimulation at this location makes it possible to stimulate the vagus nerve bilaterally, an approach not feasible for vagus nerve stimulation above the cardiac branch, as such bilateral stimulation would present an unacceptable risk to cardiac function absent a specific intent to modulate cardiac function for a therapeutic endpoint Further the treatment methods described herein may also include CAV nerve stimulation in combination with administration of suitable therapeutic agents, wherein the dosing of such therapeutic agents may be reduced relative to the dosing used for monotherapy.",

A close-up view of the distal end region of the lead 101 is shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.",

Each branch has a separate electrode mounting device 110, 120, 130. Specifically, the first branch 104 has a first electrode mounting device 110, the second branch 105 has a second electrode mounting device 120 and the third branch 106 has a third electrode mounting device 130.",

The first, second and third mounting devices 110, 120, 130 are spaced from each other along the longitudinal axis of the electrode array 100 and thus the first, second and third pairs of electrodes 111, 121, 131 are also spaced from each other along the longitudinal axis of the electrode array 100. The second pair of electrodes 121 is located between the first and third pairs of electrodes 111, 131. The longitudinal axis of the electrode array 100 is represented by arrow L in FIGS. 1 and 2a. When the electrode array 100 is mounted to the peripheral nerve 200, the longitudinal axis L of the peripheral nerve 200 is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the electrode array 100, at least at its distal end region 103.",

In this embodiment, the distances b1, b2 between the different pairs of electrodes 111, 121, 131 are each greater than the distances a1, a2, a3 between the electrodes within each pair of electrodes 111, 121, 131. The ratio between the distances a1, a2 and a3 and the distances b1 and b2 is between 1:1.5 and 1:3, and more specifically about 1:2.5 in this embodiment. In alternative embodiments, the distances a1, a2, a3 between each electrode within each pair of electrodes 111, 121, 131 may not be equal and/or the distances b1, b2 between the different pairs of electrodes 111, 121, 131 may not be equal.

The electrodes 112, 122, 132 within each pair of electrodes 111, 121, 131 extend parallel to each other. The electrodes within each pair of electrodes 111, 121, 131 are positioned side by side both along the longitudinal axis of the electrode array 100 and along the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve 200 when mounted to the peripheral nerve 200.",

                        "The electrode mounting device 110 includes a first wing 113 and a second wing 114 that are adapted to extend on opposite sides of the peripheral nerve 200 and to be engageable with each other to form a loop. FIGS. 3 and 4a show the first and second wings 113, 114 in an open position and FIG. 4b shows the first and second wings 113, 114 in a closed position where the loop, generally indicated by arrow A, is formed.",
                        "The first wing 113 has a first cuff portion 115 and a first elongate extension portion 116 extending from the first cuff portion 115. The first cuff portion 115 has a first end 1151 and a second end 1152 and the first elongate extension portion 116 has a proximal end 1161 and a distal end 1162. The proximal end 1161 of the first elongate extension portion 116 is connected to the second end 1152 of the first cuff portion 115.",
                        "Similarly, the second wing 114 has a second cuff portion 117 and a second elongate extension portion 118 extending from the second cuff portion 117. The second cuff portion 117 has a first end 1171 and a second end 1172 and the second elongate extension portion 118 has a proximal end 1181 and a distal end 1182. The proximal end 1181 of the second elongate extension portion 118 is connected to the second end 1172 of the second cuff portion 117.",
                        "The first and second cuff portions 115, 117 are engageable with each other to form the loop as shown in FIG. 4b. To allow relative movement of the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 in order to achieve the engagement, the electrode mounting device has a pivot and specifically a flexible bearing 119 that connects the first ends 1151, 1171 of the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 together. The flexible bearing 119 enables relative rotation of the first and second cuff portions 115, 117.",
                        "As evident from e.g., FIGS. 3 to 4b, the length of each elongate extension portion 116, 118 is greater than the length of each of the first and second cuff portions 115, 117, the length directions extending transversely to the longitudinal axis L of the electrode array 100. In this embodiment, each elongate extension portion 116, 118 is in the form of an elongate tab. In this regard, each elongate extension portion 116, 118 can be formed of a substantially flat strip of material. However, other configurations of the elongate extension portions are possible.",
                        "As best seen in FIGS. 4a and 4b, each cuff portion 115, 117 has an inner surface 1153, 1173 with a semi-oblong profile. Thus, when the cuff portions are closed to form the loop A, the loop has an inner surface 1153, 1173 with an oblong profile, the oblong surface profile being of a suitable shape to contact an outer surface of the peripheral nerve 200. The inner surface 1153, 1173 may press against the nerve 200 to cause a compression of the nerve 200, which may shape the nerve 200 and increase a contact area between one or more electrodes exposed at the inner surface with the nerve 200. This may improve the interface characteristics between the nerve 200 and the electrodes.",
                        "In this embodiment, the first cuff portion 115 and the second cuff portion 117 are configured so that the distance therebetween when the cuff portions are closed to form the loop A is slightly smaller than a relevant size, or dimension (e.g. height, width or cross-sectional radius) of the peripheral nerve 200 to be placed therein. Thus, the loop A may achieve the desired deformation of the peripheral nerve 200 to encourage its interface with the relevant electrodes. The loop A may be shaped and configured (e.g. by material selection) to apply a pressure to the peripheral nerve 200 to reshape the nerve over time, wherein the pressure applied to the nerve is under a predetermined limit, such as approximately 30 mm Hg (approx. 4 kPa) during reshaping. It will be understood that other predetermined limits of pressure and/or force may be suitable.",
                        "In this embodiment, the second cuff portion 117 comprises the first electrodes 112, the first electrodes being exposed at the inner surface 1173 of the second cuff portion 117 and having a generally rectangular shape.",
                        "The electrode mounting devices 110, 120, 130 each include a locking mechanism to secure the first and second wings 113, 114, and specifically their first and second cuff portions 115, 117, in the looped configuration. In this embodiment, the locking mechanism is provided in part by an opening 1131 of the first wing 113, the opening 1131 being located at a transition between the first cuff portion 115 and the first elongate extension portion 116. The second wing 114 is movable to extend at least partly through the opening 1131, the movement bringing the second ends 1152, 1172 of the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 into engagement to form the loop A as shown in FIG. 4b. To assist this process, the first and second wings 113, 114, including their elongate extension portions 116, 118, are at least partly flexible.",
                        "The width of at least the second elongate extension portion 118 tapers towards its distal end 1182. The tapering is such that the distal end 1182 of the second elongate extension portion 118 is narrower than the opening 1131 of the first wing 113, enabling it to be readily inserted, distal end 1182 first, through the opening 1131. The proximal end 1181 of the second extension portion is wider than the second end 1172 of the second cuff portion 117 and wider than the opening 1131 of the first wing 113. The proximal end 1181 of the second extension portion 118 therefore defines a shoulder 1141 at a transition between the proximal end 1181 of the second elongate extension portion 118 and the second end 1172 of the second cuff portion 117. The material forming the shoulder 1141 is deformable in order to extend through the opening 1131. The natural shape of the shoulder 1141 is deformed to fit the shoulder 1141 through the opening 1131 and returns to its natural shape once through the opening 1131, preventing retraction back through the opening 1131 and therefore securing the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 in the loop.",
                        "A process of mounting the electrode mounting devices 110, 120, 130 to a peripheral nerve 200 is now described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 5a to 5e and 6a and 6b. The peripheral nerve 200 is surgically exposed at least at regions where electrical contact is to be made and the distal end region of the electrode array 100 is brought into proximity to the peripheral nerve 200, generally as represented in FIGS. 5a and 6a.",
                        "Subsequently, as represented in FIGS. 5b and 5c, the first and second elongate extension portions 116, 118 of each electrode device 110 are fed either side of the peripheral nerve 200, generally in a direction T that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve 200, until the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 are positioned either side of the peripheral nerve 200 as shown in FIG. 5c. Due to the relatively long lengths of the first and second elongate extension portions 116, 118, the first and second elongate extension portions 116, 118 can be easier to feed either side of the peripheral nerve 200, navigating past any potentially obstructive tissue. Moreover, due to their relatively long lengths, the first and second elongate extension portions 116, 118 can be relatively easy to take hold of once they have been fed either side of the peripheral nerve 200. By taking hold of and manipulating the first and second elongate extension portions 116, 118, a surgeon can move the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 to suitable positions either side of the peripheral nerve 200 and form the loop around the peripheral nerve 200.",
                        "The forming of the loop around the peripheral nerve 200 is illustrated in FIGS. 5c to 5e. Initially, the distal end 1182 of the first elongate extension portion 118 is moved towards and into the opening 1131 of the first wing 113 (FIG. 5c). The first elongate extension portion 118 is then pulled through the opening 1131 (FIG. 5d) to a point where the second ends 1152, 1172 of the first and second cuff portions 115, 117 engage each other to form the loop A about the peripheral nerve 200 (FIGS. 5e and 6b). At this point, the first and second wings 113, 114 lock to each other by virtue of the shoulder 1141 of the second wing 114 squeezing through the opening 1131 and subsequently expanding, preventing retraction of the second elongate extension portion 118 back through the opening 1131.",
                        "After securing the first and second wings 113, 114 in the loop configuration, all or part of the first and/or second elongate extension portions 116, 118 can be removed from the electrode array 100. For example, using surgical snips or scissors, a surgeon may cut the first and second elongate extension portions 116, 118 along the line 107 indicated in FIG. 5e. In alternative embodiments, a region of weakness may be formed in the first and/or second elongate extension portions, e.g. at the line 107. The region of weakness may comprise a line of perforations, a tear notch, a score line or otherwise, enabling a user to tear off at least a part of the first and/or second elongate extension portions.",
                        "The first, second and third pairs of electrodes 111, 121, 131 are each selectively operable as a pair of stimulation electrodes, for applying an electrical stimulation signal to the peripheral nerve, and/or a pair of monitoring electrodes, for monitoring an electrical response signal at the peripheral nerve in response to an applied electrical stimulation signal.",

                        "In addition to the first, second and third pairs of electrodes, the electrode array 100 also includes return electrodes 140 (see FIG. 1) that can be used to check the quality of contact at the electrode-tissue interface for any of the first, second and third electrodes 112, 122, 132 individually and/or to check the state of the electrical circuit, including if there is a shorted or broken connection with any electrode. Moreover, the electrode array 100 includes an anchor 150 to anchor the electrode array 100 in a tissue wall, e.g. in an incision in a tissue wall adjacent the electrical stimulation location. Further, the electrode array 100 includes one or more tabs 160 (shown in FIG. 2 only) for securing the electrode array 110, e.g. a distal end region of the electrode array adjacent one or more the branches 104, 105, 106, to a surface of tissue adjacent the stimulation location. The tabs may be sutured to the tissue surface, for example. The electrode array 100 also includes conductive elements (not shown) such as conductive wires, e.g. platinum wires, that extend through the electrode array 100 and electrically connect to the electrodes.",
                        "In use, the second, monitoring pair of electrodes 121, may be placed as close as reasonably possible, along the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve, to the first, stimulating pair of electrodes 111, in order to precisely monitor the effects of the electrical stimulation at the peripheral nerve, including to pick up a \u2018C-fibre\u2019 response (e.g. as shown in FIG. 11a discussed further below). However, the present disclosure recognises that the closer the pair of monitoring electrodes is to the pair of stimulation electrodes, the greater risk that an electrical stimulation artefact will dominate the electrical response signal at least at an early response time when, for example, an \u2018A-delta fibre\u2019 response would be prevalent. By providing the third, further pair of monitoring electrodes 131, spaced further along the longitudinal axis of the peripheral nerve from the pair of stimulating electrodes 111 than the other pair of monitoring electrodes 121, this problem can be negated. If there is a stimulation artefact, of a size and duration that would significantly affect the quality of all or part of the recorded response, the further pair of monitoring electrodes 131 can provide a suitable backup or substitute, ensuring that monitoring of the response to electrical stimulation can still be successfully achieved, including for an \u2018A-delta fibre\u2019 response (e.g. as shown in FIG. 11b discussed further below).",

This location for vagus nerve stimulation is advantageous in providing stimulation of disease-relevant target organs including small intestine, the upper half of the colon, and spleen, while avoiding off-target organs associated with previously used sites for vagus nerve stimulation such as the larynx, heart, and lungs,. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that stimulation of the vagus nerve reduces both the local enteric TNF alpha levels (via cholinergic efferent production of acetylcholine) and systemic levels (via actions to the spleen) associated with IBD and other chronic inflammatory conditions thereby leading to a therapeutic or prophylactic effect on a chronic inflammatory condition such as an IBD. In addition, stimulation of the anterior or posterior CAV nerve also stimulates afferent input into hypothalamic regions, which is believed to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive affects via systemic glucocorticoid release.",

The electrode array featured three electrode mounting devices, each mounting device having a pair of platinum (99.95%) electrodes. Each electrode was embedded in a medical grade silicone elastomer carrier and had an exposed surface area of 2.5 mm\u00d70.6 mm (about 1.5 mm2). Adjacent electrode pairs were separated by 10 mm (b1 or b2 in FIG. 2), and electrodes in each pair were separated from each other by 2 mm (a1, a2 or a3 in FIG. 2).

Biphasic current pulses (10 Hz, 200 \u03bcs per phase, 50 \u03bcs interphase gap) were used to stimulate bipolar electrodes E1-E2. Neural responses were recorded from electrodes E3-E4 (10 mm from the site of stimulation) or E5-E6 (20 mm from the site of stimulation) in order to record slow and fast conduction ECAPs respectively without significant contamination from the electrical artefact. Recordings were made at intensity intervals from below threshold to 2.0 mA in 0.1 mA steps. Recordings were made at a rate of 100 kHz, filtered (high pass: 200 Hz; low pass: 2000 Hz), amplified (\u00d7103) and 50 presentations were averaged for each response. The ECAP threshold was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity producing a response amplitude of at least 1 \u03bcV in both recordings within a latency window of 4-8 ms following the stimulus. It should be understood that shorter pulse widths may produce shorter artefacts (although this may not always be the case). Therefore longer pulse widths may be used, in which case they may be accompanied by arrangement of arrays with larger b1 & b2 values than some of those described above.",

ECAP thresholds remained well below stimulation levels, and did not significantly increase over the implantation period, as shown in FIG. 12.

The tissue encapsulation was restricted to the vicinity of the array, and did not spread from this area and affect adjacent tissues. Attachment of the electrode array had not caused any macroscopic damage to the nerve, and blood vessels were typically observed running longitudinally along the implanted vagus nerve. No irritation, haemorrhaging or haematomas were observed within adjacent tissue (oesophagus, lung and pericardium).",

Analysis of the cross-section was carried out. By embedding and sectioning electrodes E3 and E4 together with the vagus nerve contained within these electrodes, we were able to examine the electrode neural interface in some detail. The vagus nerve and its fibrous tissue capsule were identified within the cavity formed around the nerve by the cuff electrode. In all animals examined (n=5), the nerve and its associated tissue capsule did not always occupy the entire cavity (data not shown). While we cannot dismiss the possibility of tissue shrinkage, these results indicate that the nerve may not always form a tight interface with the electrodes. However, the cross-sectional profile of the nerve reflects the longitudinal distortion observed in the histological sections (data not shown). Inspection of the region of the cavity in each animal showed no evidence of tissue adhesions, cellular debris or an accumulation of inflammatory cells. The platinum electrode was evident at the interface between the silicone carrier and the cavity. The vagus nerve was positioned approximately 100-200 \u03bcm from the electrode and this was typical for all animals examined using this technique.",

The ability to safely remove an electrode array is an important design consideration for the development of a safe device for clinical application. Taken together, these results indicate benefits of embodiments of the present disclosure, showing that chronic implantation of a peripheral nerve such as the vagus nerve using these embodiments is safe, functional and has highly translatable application. FIG. 13 is an in vivo macroscopic observation of the implanted array from an autopsy, which shows the typical gross tissue response around the electrode array in this example, following 12 weeks of implantation and illustrates the vagus nerve (VN) in addition to the electrode array and cable.

A subpopulation of thoracic vagal fibres have short latencies, and a benefit was found in having a longer distance (e.g. 20 mm) between the stimulating electrode pair (E1-E2) and recording electrodes (E5-E6) in order to record electrical responses outside the latency of the stimulus artefact. In contrast, a majority of thoracic vagal fibres have slower conductions and are poorly synchronized. Recordings of these electrical responses were therefore diminished over longer distances (e.g. 20 mm) between the stimulating electrode pair (E1-E2) and recording electrodes (E5-E6). Therefore, a benefit was found in having a shorter distance (e.g. 10 mm) between the stimulating electrode pair (E1-E2) and recording electrodes (E3-E4) in order to record electrode responses for slow conduction fibre types.",

This is in the same range as C-fibre conduction, suggesting that it is likely the slow conduction fibres evoked by the vagus nerve array and recorded at a site 10 mm from the site of stimulation are indeed C-fibres, and that stimulation levels were supra-threshold throughout the duration of the study. As it is believed that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of action for alleviating inflammatory diseases (e.g. IBD) is via the activation of C-fibres, the ability of the present embodiment to record evoked neural potentials that were likely to be C-fibres may be beneficial, e.g. for treating IBD or otherwise.",

The abdominal cavity was exposed and the liver retracted gently using sterile saline soaked gauze. Abdominal tissue was kept moist at all times using warm sterile saline. The sub-diaphragmatic anterior abdominal branch of the vagus nerve was identified (FIG. 15). The segment of vagus nerve rostral to the hepatic-celiac junction was detached from the underlying oesophagus and the array inserted at this location. The array was sutured (7-0 silk, Ethicon) to the oesophagus to provide stabilisation. The abdominal cavity and skin was sutured closed in two layers. The rat was rotated to expose the dorsal aspect of the spine. The percutaneous pedestal was anchored to the connective tissue of the lumbar region of the spine and the skin closed around the percutaneous pedestal.

The cervical vagus nerve was exposed and identified for implantation. A vagus nerve array (FIG. 16A, B) was then implanted onto the nerve. In the same rat, the abdominal vagus nerve was also implanted (see section above). To measure arterial blood pressure changes, the femoral artery was cannulated and connected to a transducer. Respiration patterns (i.e. breathing rate and amplitude) were recorded in isoflurane anaesthetised, freely breathing rats by placing a piezo-electric respiration band around the thorax. Care was taken to place the respiratory band sensor over the point of largest excursion during respiration. Heart rate was measured by recording ECG signals by placing needles (26 Gauge) across the thorax and a return in the left legs. The ECG signal was amplified using a WPI Iso-80 bioamp (Gain: \u00d71000; high pass: 5 Hz; low pass 10 kHz). Baseline recordings were generated for 30 seconds (no stimulation applied), followed by 20 seconds of stimulation (10 Hz, 50 repetitions) of the cervical or abdominal vagus nerve at current levels individually tested between 0-2 mA (100 \u03bcA steps; 200 \u03bcs pulse width). Following stimulation, a further 30 seconds of recordings were taken to allow the system to return to normal. Heart rate, breathing rate, breathing amplitude and blood pressure changes from baseline were calculated from the waveforms using a detection algorithm in the IGOR8 software.",

During cervical stimulation at current level 1.6 mA, heart rate decreased by 31\u00b19 beats/minute (P=0.013; FIG. 22A), compared to 0 mA (4\u00b12). However, during abdominal stimulation at 1.6 mA, heart rate remained similar to 0 mA (P=0.883). Furthermore, heart rate was significantly reduced during 1.6 mA cervical (FIGS. 22A and 23) stimulation when compared to 1.6 mA abdominal stimulation delivered at 1.6 mA (P=0.0159;FIGS. 22B and 23). Respiration recordings were noisy and could not be reliably quantified. This is perhaps due to the amount of pressure required to close the respiratory band around the rat's chest cavity, which resulted in the recording of inconsistent breathing patterns over time (within the same animal). However, visual observations of rat's (n=5) respiration confirmed that there were changes to the pattern during 1.6 mA cervical stimulation (FIG. 22Ai). However, no obvious changes in breathing (n=5) were observed during 1.6 mA abdominal stimulation (FIG. 22Bi). Furthermore, as blood pressure changes were only assessed in n=2 animals, data were not quantified. However, from our visual inspection of blood pressure recordings (n=2), we observed an abrupt decrease that coincided with the start of the 1.6 mA cervical stimulus period (FIG. 22Aii), while no changes to blood pressure were observed during 1.6 mA abdominal stimulation (FIG. 22Bii).",
