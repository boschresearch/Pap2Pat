    "title": "Anti-inflammatory Effects of Abdominal Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Experimental Intestinal Inflammation",
    "date": "2019-05-08",
    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve is an emerging treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can produce unwanted side effects. Here, we investigated whether stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ has fewer off-target effects, while reducing intestinal inflammation. An electrode array was developed to stimulate and record vagal neural responses in rats. Acute VNS off-target experiment: The cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetised rats (n=5) were acutely implanted with an electrode array, stimulation delivered (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase) and changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure assessed. Chronic VNS efficacy experiment: The abdominal vagus nerve was chronically implanted with an electrode array. After 2 weeks, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid), an established method for rodent models of IBD. Rats were randomly selected to receive therapeutic VNS (n=7; 10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase; 3 hours/day) or no stimulation (n=8) for 5 days. Stool quality, C-reactive protein in blood and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. VNS off-target experiment: Abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA: P>0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 \u00b1 9 beats/minute (P>0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. VNS efficacy experiment: During the implantation period, electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA: P>0.05), and were below stimulation levels. VNS rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA: P<0.0001), no blood in faeces (P<0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA: P<0.05) and a reduction in resident inflammatory cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis: P<0.05). Abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of IBD in humans.",

                "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), encompassing Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, are progressive debilitating immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract (Ananthakrishnan, 2015b). The impact of the disease on patient quality of life is substantial due to its onset in young adulthood, fluctuating periods in which the disease is active (relapse and remission) and the lack of a cure (Abraham and Cho, 2009). The incidence of IBD is on the increase worldwide, with the prevalence of the disease highest in North America with an estimated 1.5 million people affected (Ananthakrishnan, 2015b).",
                "The etiology of IBD is unknown, however, interactions between an individual\u2019s genetic makeup and external environment (i.e., diet, stress) play key roles in the emergence of IBD (Ananthakrishnan, 2015a). IBD is characterized by the over production of the key upstream pro-inflammatory mediator tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) from macrophages, monocytes and differentiated T cells within the gastrointestinal tissue (Sanchez-Munoz et al., 2008). The production of TNF-\u03b1 leads to the infiltration of inflammatory cells, which themselves further release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2), IL-6, and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) (Sanchez-Munoz et al., 2008; Neurath, 2014). Current gold standard immunosuppressant pharmacological therapies and anti-TNF-\u03b1 biologicals, suppress the immune reaction and reduce the cascade of cytokine release by targeting TNF-\u03b1 production (Rutgeerts et al., 2004; Nielsen and Munck, 2007). Although clinical management of such combined therapies has led to advancements in the control and prediction of the disease (Caprilli et al., 2006; De Cruz et al., 2015), adverse events in response to medication can be experienced in up to 20% of IBD patients when using these therapies (Chaparro et al., 2013; Gecse et al., 2016). Furthermore, despite the development of new anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapies and clinical management strategies, surgical resection of the inflamed area of the gastrointestinal tract is necessary in 80% of ileocecal Crohn\u2019s disease patients (Caprilli et al., 2006). Therefore, an alternative therapy that keeps patients in remission is needed to more effectively treat IBD over the long-term.",
                "A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that unilateral electrical stimulation of the left cervical vagus nerve is a feasible treatment in a rodent model of colitis (Meregnani et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013). Following chemically-induced colitis in rats, cervical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) improved the disease activity index (DAI: weight and stool quality), decreased histological damage and reduced inflammatory molecular markers expressed in colonic tissue (Meregnani et al., 2011). However, the effects of VNS therapy on histology and molecular markers were only seen in areas adjacent to, but not within, the inflammatory lesion. In a subsequent colitis study, inflammatory markers were only modestly reduced by cervical VNS, and inflammatory disease parameters (DAI, histology, inflammatory cytokine production) in VNS treated tissue did not return to control levels (Sun et al., 2013).",
                "A first, small clinical trial demonstrated efficacy cervical VNS in ileocecal Crohn\u2019s disease patients (Bonaz et al., 2016) The majority of patients (5 of 7) responded to treatment and showed a reduction in clinical symptoms (Crohn\u2019s DAI), improvements in molecular markers (C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin) and endoscopy DAI score. However, two patients experienced worsening of clinical symptoms and were removed from the study (Bonaz et al., 2016). Additionally, patients reported voice alterations (dysphonia) during stimulation (Bonaz et al., 2016). Other side effects, such as coughing, pain and labored/shortness of breath (dyspnea) are frequently reported following cervical VNS in patients treated with VNS for drug resistant epilepsy (Ben-Menachem et al., 2015). Studies in epileptic children fitted with a cervical VNS report more serious complications during sleep. Stimulation-induced effects on respiration and a reduction in overall oxygen saturation was seen in the majority of patients (87.5%, 8 patients; 100%, 10 patients, respectively) (Nagarajan et al., 2003; Zaaimi et al., 2005), while stimulus-induced changes to heart rate variability are reported in 50% of patients (10 patients) (Pruvost et al., 2006; Zaaimi et al., 2007). Another study reports stimulus-induced obstructive sleep apnea (15%; 26 patients) (Khurana et al., 2007). Such off-target affects are due to the activation of low threshold cervical vagal fibers to the larynx, pharynx, heart, and lungs (discussed in detail in the discussion), while the abdominal vagus nerve is at a site below these branches and its stimulation is predicted to results in fewer off-target effects.",
                "Although evidence for VNS therapy to treat IBD is promising, the current approach of stimulating the cervical vagus nerve has a number of clinical limitations, including potentially an undesirable side-effect profile. To overcome the limitations of cervical VNS, we hypothesized that stimulating the sub-diaphragmatic abdominal vagus nerve (Figure 1A), which is below vagal branches to the lungs and heart and closer to the end organ, will improve the therapeutic effect of VNS and have fewer off-target effects. To address this hypothesis, in this study we first developed an electrode array (in house) that was able to stimulate and record neural responses from the vagus nerve of the rats. Using this electrode array in a non-recovery experiment, referred to as the \u201cVNS off-target experiment,\u201d off-target effects to cardiac and respiratory rate were assessed during abdominal and cervical VNS. In a recovery experiment, referred to as the \u201cVNS efficacy experiment,\u201d the efficacy of abdominal VNS was assessed using a rodent model of chemically-induced intestinal inflammation (Figure 1A). Behavioral, molecular and histological markers of inflammation were evaluated to determine the efficacy of abdominal VNS, and the histology of the implanted vagus nerve examined to confirm the safety of electrode array and stimulation delivered."

Each platinum electrode had an exposed surface area of 0.3 mm2. The distance between adjacent electrodes (E1\u2013E2, or E3\u2013E4, center to center) was 1.2 mm, while the distance between electrode pairs (E1\u2013E2 to E3\u2013E4, center to center) was 4.7 mm (Figure 1B). A channel (0.55 mm wide \u00d7 0.2 mm deep) traversed the length of the array to position the vagus nerve in close contact with the electrodes without damaging the nerve. A silicone \u2018lid\u2019 completes the cuff, preventing the nerve from migrating from the channel. A Dacron embedded silicone tab adjacent to the electrode array was used to suture the array to the esophagus, when chronically implanted onto the abdominal vagus nerve, in order to provide mechanical stability (Figure 1B). Individually insulated 50 \u03bcm diameter platinum/iridium (90/10) wires were welded to each electrode and formed a helical cable which traversed to a percutaneous connector mounted on the lumbar region of the rat."

Vagus nerve implantation surgery: The left cervical vagus nerve was exposed and identified (Childs et al., 2015), and a vagus nerve electrode array (Figure 1B) implanted around the nerve. In the same rat, a second vagus nerve electrode array was implanted onto the anterior abdominal vagus nerve (see section above for details). Femoral artery cannulation and measurements: To measure arterial blood pressure changes, the femoral artery was exposed and cannulated. The cannula was connected to a calibrated blood pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments (WPI), Canada), the signal amplified and waveforms recorded (Cerebus System 128 Channel Neural Stimulator, Blackrock Microsystems, Massachusetts). Heart and respiration rate measurements: Heart rate was measured by recording electrocardiograms (ECG) by placing needles (26 Gauge) across the thorax and a return in the left leg. The ECG was amplified using a WPI Iso-80 bioamp (Gain: \u00d7103; high pass: 5 Hz; low pass 10 kHz) before being recorded via the Cerebus system. Respiration rate was measured by placing a PolyPower\u00aestretch sensor (Danfoss PolyPower, Denmark) around the upper thorax. Care was taken to place the respiratory band sensor over the largest excursion point during respiration. Stimulus-induced off-target testing: Baseline recordings of heart rate, respiration rate or blood pressure were generated for 30 s during which no (cervical or abdominal) stimulation was applied. After baseline recordings were taken, the cervical or abdominal vagus nerve was stimulated (10 Hz, 50 repetitions) at 0 or 1.6 mA (200 \u03bcs pulse width) for 20 s. To confirm that 1.6 mA stimulation applied to the cervical or abdominal vagus nerve was suprathreshold, electrically-evoked neural responses were recorded (1.6 mA, 200 \u03bcs pulse width). Following this stimulation period, 30 s of recordings were taken to monitor the return of measurements to baseline. Heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure changes from baseline were calculated from the waveforms using a detection algorithm in IGOR8 software. At the conclusion of the experiment, rats were euthanized. No tissue was taken for histology."

In brief, a 2 cm segment of control tissue was removed spanning 5\u20137 cm oral to where the ligation limiting the inflamed site had been. As TNBS-induced inflammation is patchy, the 8 cm length of inflamed intestine was divided equally into four 2 cm long segments, and cut longitudinally along the mesenteric border and pinned out onto balsa boards (mucosa side up). One half was placed in fixative (2% formaldehyde plus 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) overnight, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 \u03bcm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Pontell et al., 2009) or immunohistochemically stained with anti-CD3, a cytotoxic T cell marker (1:200; Cytomation, Dako E0432) (Payne et al., 2018c). The other half of the tissue was processed for frozen sections (14 \u03bcm) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining (Payne et al., 2018c). All sections were mounted with DPX."

Furthermore, significant off-target cardiac and respiratory events occurred during suprathreshold cervical VNS, while in contrast, no measured off-target changes were seen during abdominal VNS. The absence of off-target effects and efficacy in reducing inflammation suggests that abdominal VNS is a suitable alternative to cervical VNS. Taken together, these findings support the use of this novel peripheral nerve array for abdominal VNS as a potential treatment for IBDs, such as Crohn\u2019s disease.",
                "Stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve at higher frequencies (30 Hz) or lower frequencies (10 Hz) has the potential to activate fibers to the larynx, heart and lungs, in addition to the gastrointestinal tract and liver (Bonaz et al., 2013). In this study, cervical VNS (10 Hz, 1.6 mA, 200 \u03bcs) caused a decrease in heart rate and respiration. These changes can be attributed to the activation of large pulmonary stretch A-fibers and cardio-inhibitory vagal B fibers (McAllen et al., 2018). In a retrospective clinical study, a significant proportion of epileptic patients (n = 95) receiving cervical VNS (30 Hz, 0.25\u20133.5 mA, 500 \u03bcs) treatment reported stimulation-induced hoarseness of voice (63%), coughing (44%), and pain (37%) (Handforth et al., 1998; DeGiorgio et al., 2000). Similarly, ileocecal Crohn\u2019s disease patients treated with cervical VNS (10 Hz, 500 \u03bcs, 1.25 mA) also reported dysphonia during stimulation, although symptoms resolved over time (Bonaz et al., 2016). In humans, the effects on heart rate are less pronounced than that reported in rats, nevertheless, some clinical studies show disruptive effects to heart contractility and heart rate during stimulation of the left cervical and thoracic vagus nerve, i.e., above the vagal cardiac branches (Frei and Osorio, 2001; Lewis et al., 2001). Taken together, cervical VNS has a number of unwanted, albeit often mild, off-target effects. Such off-target effects potentially limit the intensity and duration of therapeutic stimulation delivered, thereby potentially compromising or limiting the effectiveness of the bioelectric neuromodulation treatment. In contrast abdominal VNS did not evoke changes in heart rate, respiration rate or blood pressure. These findings are in agreement with previous reports of abdominal VNS in anaesthetized pigs and humans for the treatment of post-operative ileus (Stakenborg et al., 2017), and is consistent with the known functional anatomy of the vagus.",
                "Engaging the optimal nerve fiber population is essential for an effective bioelectric neuromodulation therapy (Payne et al., 2018b). The cervical vagus nerve consists of a mixed population of large, myelinated A-fibers, smaller myelinated B-fibers and small, unmyelinated C-fibers, which have different electrical activation thresholds (Castoro et al., 2011). This is problematic for cervical VNS for the treatment of intestinal inflammation as activation of vagal C-fibers, thought to be involved in driving anti-inflammatory effects in the intestine (Martelli et al., 2014; Payne et al., 2018b), typically also activates A-fibers (Castoro et al., 2011; McAllen et al., 2018). Selective activation of C-fibers, while minimizing the activation of A- and B-fiber populations is very difficult to achieve long-term in vivo (reviewed in Guiraud et al., 2016). Some studies have demonstrated a partial preferential activation of C-fibers while suppressing A-fibers activation in the vagus nerve of pigs by delivering a non-rectangular pulse waveform (Tosato et al., 2007). However, this stimulation strategy requires high, often unsafe levels of charge to be delivered in order to be effective (Vuckovic et al., 2008; Qing et al., 2015). Targeting the abdominal vagus nerve overcomes this issue as the nerve consists primarily of C-fibers (rats: 99%; humans: 97%) (Hoffman and Schnitzlein, 1961; Prechtl and Powley, 1990). Furthermore, targeting this C-fiber dense segment of the vagus nerve might increase the clinical efficacy of stimulation in electrically-activating C-fibers. We measured the conduction velocity of the electrically-evoked neural responses elicited by abdominal VNS and they ranged between 0.55 and 0.84 m/s, which fits within the range of C-fiber conduction velocities (Castoro et al., 2011).",
                "Abdominal VNS was effective in reducing TNBS-induced inflammation, as indicated by changes in several markers, including the stool quality, systemic CRP, histology and leukocyte infiltration into transmural layers. In contrast, previous studies on experimental colitis showed cervical VNS had no protective effects within the inflammatory lesion site (Meregnani et al., 2011), and all measured inflammatory markers of colitis (mucosal index damage index, disease activity index, histological score and colonic cytokine content) remained significantly higher in tissue taken from cervical VNS rats, compared to control (P \u22650.05) (Sun et al., 2013). One explanation for this disparity is the differences in TNBS injections between studies. The concentration of TNBS administered here was 2.5% w/v, while others used higher concentrations of 40% (Sun et al., 2013) and \u223c180% (Meregnani et al., 2011). Additionally, we injected TNBS into the small intestine, rather than the colon. Vagal innervation of the small intestine, specifically the jejunum, is denser than in the distal colon (Berthoud et al., 1990); therefore the therapeutic action of VNS may have had an increased potency.",
                "The stimulation regime used in this study involved a charge density of \u223c1 \u03bcC/cm2/phase, delivered for 3 h at the same time each day (1:30\u20134:30 p.m.), with a duty cycle of 30 s ON, followed by 5 min OFF. This stimulation is well below the safety limit for platinum electrodes (Cogan et al., 2016). The stimulation timing and duty cycle were chosen to be similar to those used in the treatment of colitis (Sun et al., 2013) and ileocecal Crohn\u2019s disease (Bonaz et al., 2016), which in turn were based on VNS to treat patients with drug resistant epilepsy and depression (Sackeim et al., 2001; Cukiert et al., 2013). Therefore, it is quite likely that the timing and duty cycle used may not be optimal for the treatment of IBD; the optimization of stimulation parameters to those most appropriate for therapy has been poorly explored and remains a significant challenge for bioelectric neuromodulation therapies (Payne et al., 2018b). Testing of parameters, such as pulse durations, stimulation rate, duty cycles, and the duration and time of day that stimulation is applied, are essential to explore in appropriate animal models of the disease if bioelectric neuromodulation is to be successful long-term clinical treatment."
