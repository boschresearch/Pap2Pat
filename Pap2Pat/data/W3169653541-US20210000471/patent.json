In other instances, methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the related relevant feature being described. Also, the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and the proportions of certain parts may be exaggerated to better illustrate details and features of the present disclosure.",
                        "Several definitions that apply throughout the above disclosure will now be presented. The terms \u201ccoupled\u201d or \u201cattached\u201d defined as connected, whether directly or indirectly through intervening components, and is not necessarily limited to physical connections. The connection can be such that the objects are permanently connected or releasably connected.

The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d mean to include, but not necessarily be limited to the things so described.",
                        "Life-sustaining procedures which facilitate the removal of metabolic toxins from a patient's blood stream can include diverting arterial blood to a dialyzer, and then returning the blood to the venous blood stream. In at least one instance, arteriovenous grafts can be placed in the patient to provide access to the patient's arterial and venous blood streams. FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate an exemplary arteriovenous graft connecting an arterial and venous blood stream. Specifically, arteriovenous grafts in the upper extremity are typically placed in two major configurations: either as a brachial artery to axillary vein (brachio-axillary) upper arm graft as illustrated in FIG. 1A, or brachial artery to brachial/cephalic vein loop graft in the forearm, not illustrated. Specifically, FIG. 1A illustrates an arteriovenous graft 100 which couples an arterial blood flow 110 to a venous blood flow 120 with a graft 130. The brachial artery range in diameter is 3 to 5 mm, and the maximum blood flow velocity ranges from 60 cm/s to 100 cm/s. The axillary vein diameter ranges from 6 to 10 mm, and has a mean blood flow velocity of approximately 15 cm/s. It is generally preferred that arteriovenous grafts be implanted in a tapered tube configuration with a 4 mm end used for the arterial anastomosis to limit the steal of arterial blood from the peripheral limb. The other end may be 7 mm and is typically beveled by the surgeon to increase the circumference of the graft venous anastomosis. A detailed view of an exemplary arteriovenous graft 140 is shown in FIG. 1B. As illustrated, the graft 150 is connected to the vein having a proximal 180 and a distal end 190. In at least one instance, the graft 150 can include a tapered conduit as described above. The graft 150 can be coupled with the vein at an angle such that the toe 160 and heel 170 of the graft 150 are beveled.",
                        "Failure rates of brachio-axillary arteriovenous grafts are as high as 30% within the first 12 months. Such failure can cause acute loss of hemodialysis access and can increase patient morbidity. As many as 70% of arteriovenous grafts have complications due to reduced flow associated with stenosis that gradually occurs at the venous-end anastomosis of the arteriovenous graft.",
                        "One of the main causes of failures and complications at the venous-end anastomosis is formation of thrombus. A key catalyst for thrombus formation is shear along the adjacent vein wall at rates that are either above or below the physiological range. Shear strain rates below the threshold of 50 sH show increased fibrin deposition that stimulate coagulation cascades are greatly increased, and reduced clearance of coagulation factors at sites of vascular injury. On the other hand, shear rates elevated above 1000 sH at the site of vascular injury can lead to platelet aggregation, platelet adherence to subendothelial von Willebrand factor by surface glycoprotein lb receptor, and rapid stimulation of the coagulation cascade leading to large thrombus formation. Maintaining appropriate flow rates within physiological range at the graft-to-vein anastomosis in order to maintain graft patency.",
                        "Another aspect which can have significant effect on the wall shear stress of the graft is the angle at which the graft joins the vein. As provided herein, altering the anastomosis angle and the graft wall properties of the venous-end of a brachio-axillary arteriovenous graft may alter aberrant flow fields in this problematic area. The arteriovenous graft provided herein is optimized to the risk of graft thrombosis and extend patency by altering the venous-end anastomosis angle and adding features to the graft wall to alter the incidence of pathological vein shear strain fields. Also provided herein is a method reduce the risk of graft thrombosis, to extend patency, and/or to further alleviate shear rates at the venous-end anastomosis.",
                        "Provided herein is an arteriovenous graft for attaching to a vein at a venous anastomosis angle which provides optimum results. In various examples, the arteriovenous graft is a subcutaneous non-autogenous artificial arteriovenous graft. At one end the graft is anastomosed to an extremity artery and on the other end it is anastomosed to an adjacent extremity vein. The body of the graft is then percutaneously cannulated during hemodialysis sessions.",
                        "In at least one instance, the arteriovenous graft may have an anastomosis angle of 30\u00b0 or less and a graft end geometry that may impact blood shear rate on the adjacent venous wall. In at least one instance, the arteriovenous graft may include a cuff or beveled attachment point to the venous end of an arteriovenous graft that may mitigate unhealthy wall shear rate of blood entering the vein from the graft.",
                        "The venous end anastomosis angle of the venous-end of brachio-axillary arteriovenous grafts is associated with pathologically high and/or pathologically low wall shear strain rates. In at least one instance, a venous anastomosis angle of greater than 30\u00b0 may be associated with pathological boundary layer separation and high shear strain rates. Reducing the angle of the venous-end anastomosis may significantly improve the shear strain rates. In at least some instances, the angle of the venous anastomoses near the insertion of the arteriovenous graft may be tailored to reduce the vein wall area over which pathologically high and/or pathologically low shear strain rates occur. In accordance with the present disclosure, the venous anastomoses, where the arteriovenous graft attaches to the vein, may have an angle of about 30\u00b0. In at least some instances, the angle of venous anastomosis is less than 30\u00b0, for example 15\u00b0 or less or 13\u00b0 or less. In at least some instances, the venous end of the arteriovenous graft may be pre-cut or pre-formed to the venous anastomosis angle.",
                        "The arteriovenous graft as described herein can be made of various biocompatible materials. In at least one instance, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the arteriovenous graft model 200 can be modeled using a mesh. As illustrated, the arteriovenous graft model 200 can include an arterial blood flow 210 and a venous blood flow 220 coupled to one another via a graft 230. A cross-sectional view 240 of the venous outlet of the arteriovenous graft model 200 is provided showing the mesh refinement at the boundary layer.",
                        "Various configurations of arteriovenous grafts are illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3C. Specifically, FIG. 3A illustrates images 300, 310, 320 of an arteriovenous graft 302 that may include a plurality of grooves 304 at a venous anastomosis end of the arteriovenous graft 302. In at least one instance, the plurality of grooves 304 can be inlaid micro-digit grooves. Such grooves may be tailored to reduce the vein wall area over which pathologically high and/or pathologically low shear strain rates occur near the insertion of the graft 302. Image 310 illustrates a meshing regime having an arteriovenous graft 312 including a plurality of grooves 314. Image 320 illustrates the arteriovenous graft 322 and plurality of grooves 324, specifically showing the dimensions of the grooves 324. In at least one instance, the arteriovenous graft 302, 312, 322 may include at least three grooves 304, 314, 324 at the venous anastomosis end of the arteriovenous graft 302, 312, 322. The micro-digit grooves 304, 314, 324 may have a width of about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm, about 1 mm to about 3 mm, about 2 mm to about 4 mm, or about 3 mm to about 5 mm. In another instance, the micro-digit grooves 304, 314, 324 may have a width of about 1 mm.

In at least one instance, the micro-digit grooves 304, 314, 324 have a length of about 8.8 mm.",

For example, in some instances, the arteriovenous graft 332, 342, 352 may include a lachrymiform, or tear shaped, indent 336, 346, 356 at the venous anastomosis end. Image 340 illustrates a mesh regime of an arteriovenous graft 342 having a lachrymiform indent 346. Image 350 illustrates the size of a lachrymiform indent 356 that can be present on an arteriovenous graft 352 in accordance with the present disclosure. In at least one instance, the lachrymiform indent may have a length of about 1 mm to about 15 mm, about 2 mm to about 6 mm, about 4 mm to about 8 mm, about 6 mm to about 10 mm, about 8 mm to 12 mm, or about 10 mm to about 15 mm. In another instance, the lachrymiform indent has a length of about 13.5 mm.",

In at least one instance, the plurality of grooves 364, 374, 384 may be inset within the lachrymiform indent 366, 376, 386.",
                        "The plurality of grooves and/or lachrymiform indent function to alter the flow field of the incoming arterial blood to more closely resemble the venous blood in both direction and velocity. Such features may further optimize the prevalence of pathological wall shear strain rates. The tailored anastomosis can greatly reduce the unhealthy high and low shear strain rate on the vein wall compared to a simple anastomosis, as shown and described in greater detail with respect to FIGS. 7A-7C and 8A-8D. The reduction in unhealthy wall shear rate may lead to a lower instance of thrombosis at the venous anastomosis.",
                        "The arteriovenous graft as described herein may be made of a biocompatible material, including but not limited to, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyurethane (PU), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyacrylnitrile (PAN), and any other biocompatible material capable of achieving the desired flow. The arterial end of the arteriovenous graft may have a diameter ranging from about 3 mm to about 5 mm. The venous end of the arteriovenous graft may have a diameter of about 6 mm to about 10 mm. In at least one instance, the arteriovenous graft may have a diameter that tapers from 4 mm at an arterial anastomosis end to 7 mm at the venous anastomosis end. In some instances, the arteriovenous graft may have a length of about 50 mm to about 200 mm, about 50 mm to about 100 mm, about 75 mm to about 125 mm, about 100 mm to about 150 mm, about 125 mm to about 175 mm, and about 150 mm to about 200 mm. In at least one instance, the arteriovenous graft has a length of about 148 mm to about 152 mm. In at least one instance, the length of the arteriovenous graft can depend at least in part on the venous-end anastomosis angle of attachment at the artery. As described in further detail herein, the range of venous anastomosis configurations which can be utilized by a surgeon can include venous attachments at 90\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 15\u00b0, and 13\u00b0 angles. In some instances, the venous anastomosis has a semi major axis of about 15 mm to 30 mm for anastomosis angles of 30\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, respectively.",
                        "The shear strain rate fields at the venous end anastomosis play an important role in maintaining arteriovenous graft patency. As discussed above, shear rates above and below the physiological healthy range can lead to thrombosis formation and can result in a compromised graft. The surgical implantation of a non-autogenous graft creates an environment that is already at risk for adjacent wall inflammation and shear strain rates in the pathological range. Therefore, it is clear that the venous end graft anastomosis plays an important role in the prevalence of pathologically high and low shear strain rates and the incidence of vorticity. By optimizing the angle at which the arteriovenous graft is attached, these deleterious variables can be minimized. Modification of the venous-end anastomosis, such as including a plurality of ventral hood grooves and/or a lachrymiform indent may further decrease the occurrence of the unhealthy flow phenomena described herein. In at least one instance, the arteriovenous graft as disclosed herein has a lower high shear rate than a standard arteriovenous graft, having a 90\u00b0 angle of venous anastomosis. In another example, the arteriovenous graft has a lower low shear rate than a standard arteriovenous graft with a 90\u00b0 angle of venous anastomosis.",

In the alternative, or in addition to the plurality of grooves, the arteriovenous graft may include a lachrymiform indent at the venous anastomosis end. In at least one instance, the angle of venous anastomosis may be 15\u00b0 or less. An arteriovenous graft as described herein may have a lower high shear rate than a standard arteriovenous graft, such as one having a 90\u00b0 angle of venous anastomosis.

                                "In order to further analyze the various attachment angles, two metrics were defined to quantify the degree to which each venous-end anastomosis angle disrupted the flow pathologically. As described above, for shear strain rates in the 50 histogram bins of the pathologically low range, \u0393low was defined as the sum of a term that was the product of the inverse of the shear strain for a bin (1/{dot over (\u03b3)}n) and the area fraction \u00d8n for that bin:",

The summary metrics showing the degree to which different anastomosis designs induced pathologically low shear strain rates and pathologically high shear strain rates at the vein wall are provided in FIGS. 13A and 13B. The summary metrics suggested that the fraction of vein wall area undergoing pathologically high shear strain rates diminished with decreasing the venous-end anastomosis angle, as indicated in FIG. 13A. On the contrary, the area of the vein wall which underwent pathologically low shear rates stayed low from 90\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 then increased rapidly, as shown in FIG. 13B. The data collected suggests that increasing the angle of attachment past 30\u00b0 can lead to a rise in the area of the vein wall that experiences unhealthy high shear rate. Additionally, decreasing the angle to below 30\u00b0 can lead to a rise in the area of the vein wall that experiences unhealthy low shear rate. Therefore, it was determined that a 30\u00b0 venous-end anastomosis angle would present the healthiest shear rate environment.",
