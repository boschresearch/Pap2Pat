                        "The conversion of alcohols to hydrocarbons is generally not commercially feasible. In fact, the majority of commercial alcohols are produced from hydrocarbons. Alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion is further prohibitive due to the significant cost requirements of current conversion processes. In particular, alcohol from natural means (e.g., by fermentation of biomass) would be a significantly more cost-efficient feedstock for a conversion process.",
                        "However, a major obstacle in applying current conversion methodology to biomass-produced alcohols (i.e., bio-alcohols) is the high concentration of water (and concomitant low alcohol concentrations) typically encountered in fermentation streams produced in biomass-to-alcohol refineries. Current alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion processes are generally incapable or highly ineffective in providing such conversion at such dilute alcohol and high water concentrations. Instead, current alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion processes generally require pure alcohol (i.e., in the substantial absence of water). Yet, concentration and/or distillation of alcohol from a fermentation stream to accommodate current technologies would be highly energy intensive, and thus, would largely offset gains made in the initial low cost of using a bio-alcohol.",
                        "Another significant obstacle in existing alcohol conversion processes is the unacceptably high level of benzene produced in the hydrocarbon fraction, generally up to about 5% benzene content. However, governing environmental regulations generally require a much lower benzene content for use as a fuel. For example, in the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently imposed a benzene limit of 0.62 vol %. Thus, a further advantage would be provided by an alcohol conversion process that could produce a hydrocarbon blendstock with a substantially reduced benzene content."

                        "In one aspect, the invention is directed to a method for catalytically converting an alcohol to a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon fraction (i.e., mixture of hydrocarbons, or \u201chydrocarbon blendstock\u201d) that contains a reduced benzene content. In particular embodiments, the catalytic conversion is accomplished without requiring the alcohol to be purified or concentrated before the conversion reaction. For example, by methods described herein, effective conversion can be accomplished on dilute aqueous solutions of an alcohol, as found, for example, in the fermentation stream of a biomass fermentation reactor, to produce a hydrocarbon blendstock with a reduced benzene content.",
                        "In particular embodiments, the method includes contacting the alcohol, under conditions suitable for converting the alcohol to a hydrocarbon fraction, with a metal-loaded zeolite catalyst catalytically active for converting the alcohol to a hydrocarbon fraction, and contacting the produced hydrocarbon fraction with a benzene alkylation catalyst, under conditions suitable for alkylating benzene, to form alkylated benzene product in the hydrocarbon fraction. In a first particular embodiment, the method is practiced by contacting the alcohol with a catalyst mixture that includes the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst and benzene alkylation catalyst. In a second particular embodiment, the method is practiced by a two-step process, wherein, in a first step, the alcohol is contacted with the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst to form a hydrocarbon fraction, and in a second step, the produced hydrocarbon fraction is contacted with the benzene alkylation catalyst, wherein the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst and benzene alkylation catalyst are not mixed (i.e., separate).",
                        "In other aspects, the invention is directed to a catalyst composition that includes the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst and benzene alkylation catalyst as a mixture. In yet other aspects, the invention is directed to a one-zone or two-zone alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion reactor in which the catalyst composition is present as either a mixture or in separated form. In a particular embodiment of a two-zone reactor, a first zone contains the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst catalytically active for converting the alcohol to the hydrocarbon, and a second zone contains a benzene alkylation catalyst, wherein the two-zone reactor is constructed such that the alcohol passes through the first zone to form hydrocarbon, and the generated hydrocarbon passes into the second zone to reduce its benzene content. Additional reaction zones or processes, such as for fractionation or distillation into separate blendstocks, or for mixing into other blendstocks, may or may not also be included."

                        "As used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d generally indicates within \u00b10.5, 1, 2, 5, or 10% of the indicated value. For example, in its broadest sense, the phrase \u201cabout 100\u00b0 C.\u201d can mean 100\u00b0 C.\u00b110%, which indicates 10010\u00b0 C. or 90-110\u00b0 C.",
                        "The term \u201calcohol\u201d, as used herein, can refer to a single alcohol or a mixture of two or more alcohols, and may also include aqueous solutions of one or more alcohols. The alcohol considered herein, to be converted to hydrocarbon, is primarily, but not necessarily only, one that can be produced by a fermentation process (i.e., a bio-alcohol). Most notable examples of bio-alcohols considered herein include ethanol, n-butanol (i.e., butanol), and isobutanol. In different embodiments, the alcohol can be ethanol, or butanol, or isobutanol, or a combination thereof, as commonly found in fermentation streams. Other alcohols include n-propanol, isopropanol, sec-butanol, t-butanol, n-pentanol, and isopentanol (isoamyl alcohol). In particular embodiments, the alcohol is an aqueous solution of alcohol (i.e., the alcohol is a component of an aqueous solution), as found in fermentation streams. In fermentation streams, the alcohol is typically in a concentration of no more than about 20% (vol/vol), 15%, 10%, or 5%. In some embodiments, a fermentation stream is directly contacted with the catalyst (typically, after filtration to remove solids) to effect the conversion of the alcohol in the fermentation stream. In other embodiments, the fermentation stream is concentrated in alcohol (for example, of at least or up to 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80%) before contacting the fermentation stream with the catalyst. In yet other embodiments, alcohol in the fermentation stream is selectively removed from the fermentation stream, such as by distillation, to produce a substantially pure form of alcohol as the feedstock (e.g., a concentration of at least 90% or 95% of alcohol). In still other embodiments, the alcohol is dewatered to near azeotropic ethanol (e.g., 92-94% ethanol) or completely dewatered into 100% alcohol before contacting with the catalyst.",
                        "The term \u201chydrocarbon\u201d, as used herein, can refer to a single hydrocarbon compound or a mixture of two or more hydrocarbon compounds. Although a wide variety of hydrocarbon product can be produced by the instant method, the hydrocarbon primarily considered herein is typically saturated, and more particularly, in the class of alkanes, which may be straight-chained, or branched, or a mixture thereof, particularly when the hydrocarbon product is to be used as a fuel. The alkanes particularly desired herein include those containing at least four, five, or six carbon atoms, and up to twelve, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, or twenty carbon atoms. Some examples of straight-chained alkanes include n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, n-tetradecane, n-pentadecane, n-hexadecane, n-heptadecane, n-octadecane, n-nonadecane, and n-eicosane. Some examples of branched alkanes include isobutane, isopentane, neopentane, isohexane, 3-methylpentane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2-methylhexane, 3-methylhexane, 2,2-dimethylpentane, 2,3-dimethylpentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane, 3,3-dimethylpentane, 2-methylheptane, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane). Some other hydrocarbon products typically produced by the instant conversion method include olefins (i.e., alkenes, such as, for example, ethylene, propylene, n-butene, and/or isobutene) and aromatics (for example, naphthalene, benzene, toluene, and/or xylenes).",
                        "The hydrocarbon product particularly considered herein is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds useful as a fuel or as a blendstock in a fuel. The mixture of hydrocarbon compounds produced herein preferably substantially corresponds (e.g., in composition and/or properties) to a known petrochemical fuel, such as petroleum, or a fractional distillate of petroleum. Some examples of petrochemical fuels include gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and jet propellant (e.g., JP-8). Like hydrocarbon fuel grades in current use, the mixture of hydrocarbon compounds produced herein can, in some embodiments, be predominantly or exclusively composed of alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, or a mixture thereof. The raw hydrocarbon product, produced by the instantly described method, is typically fractionated by distillation into different fuel grades, each of which is known to be within a certain boiling point range. A particular advantage of the instant method is its ability to produce such fuel grades in the substantial absence of contaminants (e.g., mercaptans) normally required to be removed during the petroleum refining process. Moreover, by appropriate adjustment of the catalyst and processing conditions, a select distribution of hydrocarbons can be obtained.",
                        "Depending on the final composition of the hydrocarbon product, the product can be directed to a variety of applications, including, for example, as precursors for plastics, polymers, and fine chemicals. The process described herein can advantageously produce a range of hydrocarbon products that differ in any of a variety of characteristics, such as molecular weight (i.e., hydrocarbon weight distribution), degree of saturation or unsaturation (e.g., alkane to alkene ratio), and level of branched or cyclic isomers. The process provides this level of versatility by appropriate selection of, for example, composition of the catalyst (e.g., catalytic metal), amount of catalyst (e.g., ratio of catalyst to alcohol precursor), processing temperature, and flow rate (e.g., LHSV).",
                        "The process described herein combines the use of an alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion catalyst (i.e., metal-loaded zeolite) and a benzene alkylation catalyst. As further described below, the method combines the two catalysts by using the two catalysts in either a mixed (combination) or unmixed (separated) state. In the context of the instant disclosure, the compositions of the two catalysts are different.",
                        "In one embodiment of the conversion method described herein, a two-stage process is employed. In the first stage, an alcohol is first catalytically converted to a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon fraction by contacting the alcohol with a metal-loaded zeolite catalyst at conditions (particularly, temperature and choice of catalyst) suitable to effect said conversion. In the second stage, the produced hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon fraction is then contacted with a benzene alkylation catalyst, under conditions suitable for alkylating benzene, to form alkylated benzene product from benzene contained in the produced hydrocarbon fraction. Other aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene, xylenes, ethylbenzenes, and naphthalene) that may be present in the hydrocarbon fraction are generally also alkylated during the benzene alkylation process.",
                        "In the first and second stages, a suitable reaction temperature is independently employed during contact of the alcohol with the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst and then with contact of the hydrocarbon with the benzene alkylation catalyst. The temperature for each stage may be the same or different. Generally, the reaction temperature is at least 100\u00b0 C. and up to 550\u00b0 C. In different embodiments, the reaction temperature for each of the processes is precisely, about, at least, above, up to, or less than, for example, 100\u00b0 C., 125\u00b0 C., 150\u00b0 C., 175\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C., 225\u00b0 C., 250\u00b0 C., 275\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C., 325\u00b0 C., 350\u00b0 C., 375\u00b0 C., 400\u00b0 C., 425\u00b0 C., 450\u00b0 C., 475\u00b0 C., 500\u00b0 C., 525\u00b0 C., or 550\u00b0 C., or a temperature within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing exemplary temperatures, e.g., 100\u00b0 C.-550\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C.-550\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C.-550\u00b0 C., 400\u00b0 C.-550\u00b0 C., 450\u00b0 C.-550\u00b0 C., 100\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C., 350\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C., 400\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C., 450\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C., 100\u00b0 C.-450\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C.-450\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C.-450\u00b0 C., 350\u00b0 C.-450\u00b0 C., 400\u00b0 C.-450\u00b0 C., 100\u00b0 C.-425\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C.-425\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C.-425\u00b0 C., 350\u00b0 C.-425\u00b0 C., 375\u00b0 C.-425\u00b0 C., 400\u00b0 C.-425\u00b0 C., 100\u00b0 C.-400\u00b0 C., 200\u00b0 C.-400\u00b0 C., 300\u00b0 C.-400\u00b0 C., 350\u00b0 C.-400\u00b0 C., and 375\u00b0 C.-400\u00b0 C.",
                        "Generally, ambient (i.e., normal atmospheric) pressure of about 1 atm is used at least for the conversion process described herein. However, in some embodiments, an elevated pressure or reduced pressure may be used for either the conversion or alkylation process. In typical embodiments, an elevated pressure is used in the alkylation process. In different embodiments, the elevated pressure may be, for example, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, or 15 atm. In other embodiments, the pressure may be reduced to, for example, 0.5, 0.2, or 0.1 atm for either the conversion or alkylation process, or both.",
                        "The catalysts and reactor can have any of the designs known in the art for catalytically treating a fluid or gas at elevated temperatures, such as a fluidized bed reactor. The process may be in a continuous or batch mode. In particular embodiments, the alcohol is injected into a heated reactor such that the alcohol is quickly volatilized into gas, and the gas passed over the catalyst. In some embodiments, the reactor design includes a boiler unit and a reactor unit if the fermentation stream is used directly as a feedstock without purification. The boiler unit is generally not needed if the fermentation stream is distilled to concentrate ethanol because the distillation process removes the dissolved solids in the fermentation streams. The boiler unit volatilizes liquid feedstock into gases prior to entry into the reactor unit and withholds dissolved solids.",
                        "Additional reaction zones or processes may or may not also be included. For example, in some embodiments, the produced hydrocarbon blendstock, after, during, or prior to reaction with the alkylation catalyst, may be fractionated, distilled, or otherwise separated into narrower carbon range blendstocks. In other embodiments, the produced hydrocarbon blendstock, after, during, or prior to reaction with the alkylation catalyst, may be mixed with or into another hydrocarbon blendstock or mixed with an alkylating reactant (e.g., an olefin, such as ethylene, or an alkenyl chloride or alkyl chloride). In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon blendstock or a separated or purified portion thereof, after reaction with the alkylation catalyst, may be processed into a new product, such as a commercially or industrially relevant product derived from hydrocarbons, e.g., an alkane, alkene, alkylated benzene, polycyclic aromatic, alkylated polycyclic aromatic, or polymer. In yet other embodiments, the alcohol, prior or during contact with the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst, may be concentrated, purified (e.g., by distillation), or mixed with another alcohol or solvent (e.g., water). Any of the foregoing exemplary additional processes may be integrated into the instant process, typically, by interconnecting the apparatus necessary for the additional process with the apparatus necessary to practice the instant process.",
                        "In another embodiment of the conversion method described herein, a direct (single-stage or single-step) process is employed in which the alcohol is contacted with a mixture (combination) of the metal-loaded zeolite catalyst and benzene alkylation catalyst under suitable conditions to directly produce a hydrocarbon fraction reduced in benzene content. The term \u201cmixture\u201d or \u201ccombination\u201d as used herein, generally indicates a solid solution containing solid particles of each of the catalysts in direct contact or near contact with each other. The solid particles, either between like and/or different compositions, may be unfused or fused. A solid solution without direct contact between the different types of catalyst particles can be established by, for example, incorporating particles of each type of catalyst in a common scaffold or support, while keeping the two types of catalyst in separated locations of the scaffold or support. The term \u201cnear contact\u201d, generally indicates no more than or less than 5 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm, or 0.5 cm distance between the two types of particles. The term \u201cparticles\u201d, as used herein, includes solid shapes of any suitable dimension, which may be in the nanometer range (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, or 500 nm), micrometer range (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 500 microns), or macroscale range (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 50 mm), or a dimension within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing exemplary values.",
                        "In the single-step process, hydrocarbon generated from reaction of the alcohol with the metal-loaded zeolite is instantaneously reacted with the alkylation catalyst included in the combination catalyst as hydrocarbon is formed. The single-step process may utilize any of the temperature and other processing conditions described above for the two-stage process. Moreover, the single-step process may or may not include any one or more additional processes, such as those exemplified above.",
                        "The alkylated benzene portion produced by reaction of the hydrocarbon fraction and alkylation catalyst includes one or a mixture of any of the alkylated benzene compounds that can be produced by the alkylation process. Some specific examples of alkylated benzene product include the ethylbenzenes, isopropylbenzenes (e.g., cumene (isopropylbenzene), diisopropylbenzenes, and triisopropylbenzenes), and butylbenzenes. Typically, at least a portion of the alkylated benzene product is ethylated benzene, which can be, for example, mono-, di-, or tri-ethylated benzene. The ethylbenzenes are generally produced by reaction of benzene with ethylene, wherein ethylene is generally produced during the conversion process. Similarly, other higher alkylbenzenes are generally produced by reaction of benzene with higher alkenes (e.g., propylene, butene, pentene, hexene) formed in the conversion process. Since other unsaturated or aromatic compounds aside from benzene (e.g., toluene, the xylenes, trimethylbenzenes, biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, cyclobutene, cyclopentene, and cyclohexene, and methylated derivatives thereof) are also generally produced in the conversion process, the alkylation process generally results in the production of other alkylated aromatics and alkylated polycyclics (e.g., ethyltoluenes, ethylxylenes, ethylnapthalenes, ethylcyclobutenes, and ethylcyclopentenes, and methylated derivatives thereof). Any of these alkylated aromatic or polycyclic compounds may be isolated for use as a commercially or industrially relevant product. Alternatively, any of these alkylated aromatic or polycyclic compounds may be further reacted (e.g., with an alkene feed under alkylation conditions) to form a product of commercial or industrial relevance. Since cyclic unsaturated or aromatic compounds other than benzene are generally also alkylated by the alkylation process used herein, the method can be said to reduce the content of not only benzene, but also other non-alkylated cyclic unsaturated or aromatic compounds as well.",
                        "The term \u201creduced in benzene content\u201d, as used herein, means that the benzene content in the hydrocarbon fraction after reaction with the alkylation catalyst is lower than the benzene content in the hydrocarbon fraction before reaction with the alkylation catalyst (in a two-stage process) or without the alkylation catalyst (in a one-step process using a catalyst mixture). In different embodiments, the benzene content in the hydrocarbon fraction directly after reaction with the alkylation catalyst, or after reaction with a mixture of the two catalysts, is precisely, about, up to, or less than, for example, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, or 0.1% by volume of the hydrocarbon fraction. In a particular embodiment, the benzene content in the hydrocarbon fraction directly after reaction with the alkylation catalyst is no more than or less than 0.62% by volume of the hydrocarbon fraction, in accordance with existing EPA regulations. In other embodiments, the amount of benzene is substantially or completely absent (i.e., up to or less than 0.05%, 0.02%, 0.01%, or even 0%). In some embodiments, the term \u201creduced in benzene content\u201d can also mean \u201creduced in non-alkylated cyclic unsaturated compounds\u201d or \u201creduced in non-alkylated aromatic compounds\u201d, wherein any of the exemplary percentages by volume provided for benzene content can alternatively be taken as content of non-alkylated cyclic unsaturated compounds or content of non-alkylated aromatic compounds.",

By being \u201cintegrated\u201d is meant that alcohol produced at a fermentation facility or zone is sent to and processed at an alcohol-to-hydrocarbon conversion facility or zone that performs the conversion process described above. Preferably, in order to minimize production costs, the fermentation process is in close enough proximity to the conversion facility or zone, or includes appropriate conduits for transferring produced alcohol to the conversion facility or zone, thereby not requiring the alcohol to be shipped. In particular embodiments, the fermentation stream produced in the fermentation facility is directly transferred to the conversion facility, generally with removal of solids from the raw stream (generally by filtration or settling) before contact of the stream with the catalyst.",

In other embodiments, the fermentation process is part of a larger biomass reactor facility, i.e., where biomass is decomposed into fermentable saccharides, which are then processed in a fermentation zone. Biomass reactors and fermentation facilities are well known in the art. Biomass typically refers to lignocellulosic matter (i.e., plant material), such as wood, grass, leaves, paper, corn husks, sugar cane, bagasse, and nut hulls. Generally, biomass-to-ethanol conversion is performed by 1) pretreating biomass under well-known conditions to loosen lignin and hemicellulosic material from cellulosic material, 2) breaking down cellulosic material into fermentable saccharide material by the action of a cellulase enzyme, and 3) fermentation of the saccharide material, typically by the action of a fermenting organism, such as a suitable yeast.",

The nanosized particles can have a particle size of precisely, at least, up to, or less than, for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, or 950 nanometers (nm), or a particle size within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values. In a second set of embodiments, at least a portion, or all, of the particles of the powder have a size at or above 1 micron in size. The micron-sized particles can have a particle size of precisely, at least, up to, or less than, for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 microns (m), or a particle size within a range bounded by any two of the foregoing values. In some embodiments, single crystals or grains of the catalyst correspond to any of the sizes provided above, while in other embodiments, crystals or grains of the catalyst are agglomerated to provide agglomerated crystallites or grains having any of the above exemplary dimensions.",
                        "In other embodiments, the zeolite catalyst can be in the form of a film, a coating, or a multiplicity of films or coatings. The thickness of the coatings or multiplicity of coatings can be, for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, or 100 microns, or a range therein, or up to 100 micron thickness. In yet other embodiments, the zeolite catalyst is in the form of a non-particulate (i.e., continuous) bulk solid. In still other embodiments, the zeolite catalyst can be fibrous or in the form of a mesh.",
                        "The benzene alkylation catalyst can be any of the benzene alkylation catalysts known in the art. In a one-step process in which a catalyst mixture is used, the benzene alkylation catalyst is generally a solid, and typically in the form of particles, in order to form a solid solution of the conversion and alkylation catalysts. In a two-step process in which the two catalysts are separate, the benzene alkylation catalyst can be any of the benzene alkylation catalysts known in the art, including solid and liquid (and solid-liquid) alkylation catalysts.",
                        "In a first embodiment, the benzene alkylation catalyst is a zeolite catalyst. Any of the zeolite catalysts described above that may possess benzene alkylation activity could be used as an alkylation catalyst herein, provided that the alkylation catalyst has a composition different than the conversion catalyst. Some examples of zeolite-based alkylation catalysts include zeolite Y, Ca-zeolite Y, mordenite, MCM (e.g., MCM-22, MCM-41, MCM-48, MCM-49, MCM-56, MCM-58, or MCM-68), ZSM-5, ZSM-11, and zeolite beta catalysts, as well as combinations thereof, and phosphate modified forms thereof. The zeolite-based alkylation catalysts are often in their ammonium (e.g., NH4+), hydrogen, or alkali metal forms, although heavier metal-loaded forms (e.g., Al, Zr, Fe, and other metal forms, as above) are also used. In the particular case of a ZSM-5 catalyst, the catalyst may be exchanged in some cases with H, La, Mg, Pt, or Zn.",
                        "In a second embodiment, the alkylation catalyst is a Friedel-Crafts type of catalyst. Some examples of Friedel-Crafts types of catalysts include mixtures of AlCl3 and HCl (for which the alkylation process is generally practiced below 135\u00b0 C. and at sufficient pressure to keep the reactants in the liquid phase), a composite of phosphoric acid and a solid binder material, such as kieselguhr or diatomaceous earth (for which the alkylation process is generally practiced in a fixed bed reactor at 180-240\u00b0 C.), hydrogen fluoride (HF), and boron trifluoride (BF3), wherein the latter two may be in gaseous form, in solution, or in adduct form (e.g., etherate). Other Friedel-Crafts catalysts include SbCl5, FeCl3, and AlBr3. The alkylation process using a Friedel-Crafts catalyst may or may not further include an alkyl halide that functions to alkylate the benzene and other aromatic compounds.",
                        "The process conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure) generally employed with benzene alkylation catalysts are well known in the art. In some embodiments, the conditions used for treating the hydrocarbon fraction with the benzene alkylation catalyst can be any of the conditions provided supra for the conversion process.",
                        "In particular embodiments, the conversion catalyst and alkylation catalyst are selected in a manner that tunes the fractionation of the end hydrocarbon product toward a higher boiling fraction. The higher boiling fraction is preferably one that mimics a diesel jet or gasoline fuel.",
                        "When a mixture of catalysts is used, any suitable weight ratio of the alcohol conversion catalyst and alkylation catalyst (with respect to the total amount of catalyst) can be used. In different embodiments, the alkylation catalyst is included in an amount of precisely, about, at least, above, up to, or less than, for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 wt % with respect to the total weight of the catalyst mixture. The alkylation catalyst may also be included within a range of any of the foregoing exemplary values, such as in an amount of 5-50 wt %.",
                        "Any of the catalysts described above, if appropriate, may be mixed with or affixed onto a support material. The support material can be a powder (e.g., having any of the above particle sizes), granular (e.g., 0.5 mm or greater particle size), a bulk material, such as a honeycomb monolith of the flow-through type, a plate or multi-plate structure, or corrugated metal sheets. If a honeycomb structure is used, the honeycomb structure can contain any suitable density of cells. For example, the honeycomb structure can have 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900 cells per square inch (cells/in2) (or from 62-140 cells/cm2) or greater. The support material is generally constructed of a refractory composition, such as those containing cordierite, mullite, alumina (e.g., \u03b1-, \u03b2-, or \u03b3-alumina), or zirconia, or a combination thereof. Honeycomb structures, in particular, are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,314,665, 7,442,425, and 7,438,868, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. When corrugated or other types of metal sheets are used, these can be layered on top of each other with catalyst material supported on the sheets such that passages remain that allow the flow of alcohol-containing fluid or hydrocarbon gas. The layered sheets can also be formed into a structure, such as a cylinder, by winding the sheets.",
