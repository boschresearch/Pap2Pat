                        "An aneurysm is the abnormal focal dilatation of an artery, resulting from weakening of vessel walls with potential for rupture. The weak or thin spot on the artery in the brain balloons or bulges out and fills with blood, and a rupture of the aneurysm can have a mass effect on the nerves or brain tissue. Cerebral aneurysms often appear at arterial bifurcation points, particularly as wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms (WNBA), since locations with disturbed blood flow are more susceptible to aneurysm development. Different sources report rates of 1-5% of the population with asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms. If the aneurysm ruptures, the resulting subarachnoid hemorrhage can cause serious health problems such as hemorrhagic stroke, brain damage, coma, and death. The chances of successful treatment are higher when the aneurysm is discovered incidentally.",
                        "A major advance in endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms came with the introduction of Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDC). GDC are bare-platinum coils that may be deployed within the aneurysm sac to promote thrombosis and aneurysm occlusion. Additional advancement in endovascular aneurysm treatment was provided through the development of flow diverting devices, such as intracranial flow-diverting stents (FDS). The first product of this type was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 (FDA Pre-Market Approval: P100018). Flow diverters include finely woven mesh stents that divert the blood flow from the aneurysm sac. Such devices may be designed to be placed in the lumen of the parent vessel at the point of bifurcation. Various innovative devices have changed the landscape of treatment options. One of these is the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) embolization system (MicroVention, A Terumo Group Company), approved by FDA in late 2018 (FDA Pre-Market Approval: P170032). The WEB device is an intrasaccular braided implant that is placed within the aneurysm sac. The WEB device may be used on ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.",
                        "The success of treatment with an intrasaccular device depends on complete occlusion of the blood flow into the aneurysm sac. As a result, the correct choice of the size of the intrasaccular device size for the given aneurysm is an extremely important step in treatment planning. Accordingly, a need exists for improvements in measurements of aneurysm sacs, as well as improvements in sizing for treatment devices."

Marking or delineating the contour of the aneurysm sac may be performed by an expert neuro-interventional radiologist and can be a time consuming and expensive aspect performed in a time critical situation of implant selection. Aspects presented herein provide tools with additional assistance information to assist in measurement and implant selection.",

Aspects additionally provide for the automatic identification of a treatment device or a set of potential treatment devices to be implanted in the aneurysm sac. Aspects additionally provide for an automated prediction of outcome results associated with the identified treatment device or set of treatment devices. The present disclosure provides decision support software systems as a tool to assist in identifying a promising treatment at a rapid pace. The automated detection and/or segmentation, the identification of a potential treatment device (e.g., including a size or model), and/or the information about a predicted outcome of such treatment provides added tools for a user to consider in developing a treatment plan for an aneurysm. The automated aspects reduce the time for identification, segmentation, and identification of treatment devices, which can increase the pace at which treatment can be delivered to a patient. Aspects include the use of a neural network or neural network component that enables the additional consideration of a history of other data including prior aneurysm data in performing the detection, identification, and segmentation. The feedback aspects enable the model to continually improve the output provided to users. The combined use of imaging data and clinical information provides a more accurate and efficient estimation or prediction.

                        "The success of treatment with an intrasaccular device, such as an intrasaccular embolization device, may depend on complete occlusion of the blood flow into the aneurysm sac. The completeness of the occlusion is affected by the size choice for a treatment device. A clinician, such as an interventional neuroradiologist (INR), may make an angiographic study of the vessel complex and measure key dimensions of the aneurysm sac. As an example, the clinician may perform a pre-operative digital subtraction angiography (DSA), intra-operative DSA, or other imaging systems such as, but not limited to, optical coherence tomography, positron tomography, near-IR spectroscopy, and ultrasound. The clinician may measure the height of the aneurysm sac, the dome width of the aneurysm sac, and the neck size of the aneurysm sac on both lateral and anterior-posterior (AP) views on DSA images. FIG. 1A illustrates an example image of an aneurysm sac 102, and FIG. 1B illustrates an example treatment device 104 that may be implanted at the aneurysm sac. In FIG. 1A, the image is a 2D Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) image 100 that may be used to measure the height 106, dome width 108, and the neck size 110 of the aneurysm sac 102. As an example, the clinician may perform the measurements manually, and may perform the measurement in multiple views such as in both AP and lateral views. The treatment device 104 in FIG. 1B is a woven embolization type device, and is one of various types of treatment devices that can be considered in connection with the present disclosure. As well, a particular type of treatment device may include various models, each having a maximum height and diameter in the implant model's fully open state. FIG. 1B illustrates a height and diameter dimension for the treatment device 104. The size of the treatment device may be selected based on these measurements to ensure correct fit and device activation. The size of the treatment device 104 in FIG. 1B is not proportional to the DSA image in FIG. 1A.",
                        "FIG. 1C illustrates an example diagram 120 showing the treatment device 104 implanted within an aneurysm sac 102 to disrupt the flow into the aneurysm sac. In some aspects, the treatment device may come in various combinations of height and diameter. Table 1 illustrates an example set of different diameter and height measurements for various example models. Table 1 only presents a few example dimensions in order to illustrate the concept, and various additional combinations of diameter and height may be considered for selection of a treatment device for a particular aneurysm treatment.",
                        "In some aspects, the largest two dimensions of the aneurysm sac 102 may be used to determine the diameter/height combination of the treatment device 104 to be implanted into the aneurysm sac 102. DSA may be used for measuring the dimensions and characteristics of aneurysms as a step in planning interventional treatments. Incorrect sizing of the aneurysm sac may lead to incomplete treatment by leading to use of an intrasaccular implant device that is too small or too large to provide effective treatment of the aneurysm. An intrasaccular flow disruptor, such as the treatment device shown in FIG. 1B and FIG. 1C, treats aneurysms by diverting the blood flow from the aneurysm sac. Residual blood flow into the aneurysm sac after intervention by implanting the treatment device 104",
                        "To avoid under-sizing the treatment device 104 to be implanted, the aneurysm sac dimensions may be measured on the working projection DSA image, which may show the maximum dimensions of the sac prior to the procedure. Aspects presented herein provide an automatic, or semi-automatic, reliable, and fast algorithm to segment the aneurysm sac and/or to identify potential treatment devices with predicted treatment outcome, which may decrease the time of measurement and improve the accuracy of implant selection. For example, aspects presented herein may help to improve the selection of the treatment device 104 in order to minimize residual blood flow into the aneurysm sac after the treatment device 104 is implanted. Aspects presented herein further provide a tool based on transfer learning to train a highly accurate segmentation deep neural network for contouring the sac of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms in a more efficient and reliable manner, identifying a device for implant, and providing a prediction of outcome associated with the identified device based on imaging data and/or clinical information.",

In other aspects, the module 220 may be configured to return a measurement or predictive information to the user device in response to receipt of a particular user query. FIG. 4A illustrates an example user interface 400 that may be presented at a user device to enable the user device to submit, or enter, imaging study or clinical information for a patient, e.g., through submission component 402, and to request measurement or predictive information results from the module 220. As an example, the user device 204 may send a request, or query, for an automated, or semi-automated, measurement based on imaging study information, e.g., based on a user selection of a segmentation request option 404 presented to the user at the user interface 400. The request may be received via the query component 224. In response to the request, the module 220 may perform the automated measurement and send the measurement information to the user device 204. As another example, a user device 204 may send a request to the module 220 for an identification of a treatment device and/or a predicted outcome result for treatment with the treatment device, e.g., based on a user selection of a device identification request option 406 or an outcome prediction request option 408 presented to the user at the user interface 400. In response to the request, the module 220 may perform the automated measurement and send an identification of one or more potential treatment devices (e.g., type and/or size), with or without predicted treatment outcome information, to the user device 204. FIG. 4B illustrates an example user interface that shows an example of measurement and predictive information that may be provided, e.g., displayed, at a user interface 425 at a user device 204 based on the information generated at and sent from the module 220.",

As an example, the measurement information that is input may include a height, width, and/or dome measurement in an AP and lateral view from DSA images. The imaging data may include one or more views from any of various types of imaging sources. As an example, imaging data may be input based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or a computed tomography (CT) scan, among other examples. As presented herein, the cerebral arteriography information may be used to confirm the presence of an aneurysm and to evaluate which treatment options may be best suited for particular aneurysms based on size, shape and location. In some aspects, the imaging data may include two-dimensional (2D) DSA images. The images may be pre-operative imaging information. The images may be obtained within an operating suite prior to implanting an intrasaccular device for treatment of aneurysm, for example. In some aspects, the imaging data may include three-dimensional (3D) data, such as an axial slice stack reconstructed from a sequence of 3D-DSA images produced by a rotational C-arm angiography. Other examples of imaging include slice stacks (axial, sagittal, or coronal) contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) (such as DynaCTA or VasoCTA). The model presented herein may be trained to use any type of image information, e.g., 2D images, an axial slice stack reconstructed from a sequence of 3D-DSA images, among other examples. In some aspects, the imaging data information may be raw imaging information, e.g., that has not been marked, cropped, or annotated by a user to guide the segmentation. In other aspects, a user may input some additional input on the imaging information. For example, a user may select a rectangular area to be analyzed. The user may mark, crop, annotate, or otherwise adjust the imaging data prior to the imaging data being received in the system.",

For example, an annotation may be added to image data, such as shown in FIG. 1A to indicate a height, a width, and/or a dome length of an aneurysm region in imaging information. As a further example, the annotations may be indicated on multiple orthogonal DSA projections, such as AP and lateral projections, to deliver multiple dimensions (e.g., six dimensions for two projections) for analysis. As an additional measurement, the area of the aneurysm sac may be included as an annotation. The area may be calculated, e.g., by a clinician marking a contour of the aneurysm. Similar to input for a particular patient, such measurements may be included with data sets of imaging information for training data to train the neural network component to perform automatic segmentation/measurement and/or automatic identification/detection of an aneurysm sac.",

The selected health conditions may be selected as determinants of outcome based on their differential prevalence in the complete occlusion or partial occlusion class. A ratio of the co-occurrence of a given health condition with the total number of cases for the class. As an example, the ratio of hypertension/complete occlusion ratio may correspond to 28/49=0.57 and hypertension/partial occlusion ratio may correspond to 2819/32=0.59. The ratio of migraines/complete occlusion may correspond to 28/49=0.057 and for migraines/partial occlusion may correspond to 14/32=0.44. Health conditions that have a ratio below a threshold may be filtered out. For example, health conditions having a ratio below 0.30 may be filtered out of the consideration. The threshold may be based on input from a clinician. The health conditions remaining after the filtration correspond to candidate conditions for a classification task. To select discriminative conditions between two classes from candidate conditions, an absolute different may be computed between the prevalence ratios from the two classes. Then, conditions may be retained that have a difference of 0.10 or above. As an example, migraines may be selected that have an absolute difference of 0.13 between the ratios (|0.57\u22120.11\u2295) while hypertension may be filtered out that has an absolute difference of 0.02 between the two ratios (|0.57\u22120.059|). The information gain may be used as a metric to rank features. The information gain metric may rank features independently for their class separability. The features could have a different rank when used in a set for classification. In order to identify such feature groups, while keeping the top features, e.g., with information gain above 0.15, various combinations of other clinical and imaging features may be added in a greedy fashion based on weighted F1 scores, e.g., in 10-fold cross validation.",
