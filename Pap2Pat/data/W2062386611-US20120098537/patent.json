    "date": "2010-06-11 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The invention relates to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). NMR experiments are usually carried out in homogeneous magnetic fields. In many cases however, the inherent heterogeneity of the samples or living organisms under investigation, and the poor homogeneity of the magnets (particularly when bulky samples must be placed outside their bores), make it virtually impossible to obtain high-resolution spectra. Unstable power supplies and vibrations arising from cooling can lead to field fluctuations in time as well as space. Here it is shown how high-resolution NMR spectra can be obtained in inhomogeneous fields with unknown spatiotemporal variations. The method of the invention, based on coherence transfer between spins, can accommodate spatial inhomogeneities of at least 11 G/cm and temporal fluctuations slower than 2 Hz.",

                        "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is arguably one of the most versatile and ubiquitous forms of spectroscopy. Year after year, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals more surprising insights into morphology, function, and metabolism. Most applications, regardless of whether they are concerned with inanimate solids or liquids or with living organisms, rely on the use of very homogeneous magnetic fields B0 with spatial variations below about 10\u22129, so that subtle differences in the environment of various nuclei, leading to chemical shifts and couplings, can be made apparent. However, it is often not possible to work under ideal conditions. For example, sufficiently homogeneous fields are difficult to achieve in ex situ NMR where the object under investigation is placed outside the magnet (1, 2), in very high fields induced by resistive or hybrid magnets (3, 4), and in samples (including animals and human beings) which are moving because of pulsating arteries or respiration, not to mention the discontinuities of the magnetic susceptibility due to voids and surgical implants (5, 6).",
                        "Many techniques have been proposed to acquire high-resolution spectra under adverse conditions. Spin-echoes (7, 8) can refocus the effects of inhomogeneous B0 fields, and reveal couplings that lead to echo modulations (9-11). If the field's spatial distribution is known, the B0 inhomogeneity may be compensated by using a radio-frequency (rf) field designed to have a similar, spatially correlated profile. Two such approaches have been described. In the first one, the rf-field B1(r) profile is designed to match the B0(r) profile (12-14). The dephasing caused by the rf-field can then be refocused by rephasing in the main B0 field. In the second approach, the inhomogeneities are compensated by manipulating the phases of the magnetization vectors associated with different voxels in the presence of a known gradient, in the manner of multidimensional single-scan experiments (15, 16). In either case, the field B0(r) must be time-independent, and its spatial profile must be known, which constitutes a serious handicap.",
                        "In the present invention, high-resolution spectra in inhomogeneous fields are obtained by tracking the differences of the precession frequencies (17, 18) of two spins in a single scan, in a way that is closely related to the ultrafast multidimensional experiments developed by Frydman et al (19) and improved in reference (20) (the content of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto). The experiment functions regardless B0 field profile. Spatial inhomogeneities of at least 11 G/cm can be accommodated. This corresponds to a frequency distribution of about 42 kHz (or 70 ppm for a 600 MHz resonance frequency) for a spherical sample of 1 cm in diameter. Combining this technique with the J-modulated detection scheme of Giraudeau and Akoka (21) adds a second dimension which reveals multiplets due to scalar couplings.",

Let S and I constitute a homonuclear pair of spins.

GE and GD are encoding and decoding gradients. The gradients GA and GB of equal area serve to select the desired coherence pathways (they must be opposite for (B) and (C) and identical for (A)). The delay \u03c3C serves to compensate for the evolution under the inhomogeneous B0 field during GA and GB. Increasing GB and prolonging \u03c3C by \u03c3D/2 shift the signals at zero frequency toward the centre of the gradient GD. Sequences (D) and (E) are adaptations of (B) and (C), for situations where a permanent gradient is dominant. Adiabatic pulses with down-pointing arrows have reversed sweep directions. The phases of the n pulses during decoding are alternated between x to \u2212x every two pulses (21). In these examples, \u03c0/2 pulses are used to achieve transfer of coherence, so that the spins need to be scalar coupled. Other sequences can be used, such as total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY). The signals during even (or odd) decoding gradients are arranged in sequential order, to give a two-dimensional array. The gradient echoes that are formed during each decoding gradient appear in a temporal sequence that corresponds to the peaks in the spectrum. The scalar coupling pattern in the other dimension is obtained by performing a Fourier transformation as a function of the index of the decoding gradients.",

Although this feature is reminiscent of zero-quantum spectroscopy, it should be noted that the echoes arise simply from the differential evolution of two single quantum (SQ) coherences (18). During the decoding gradient GD in the scheme of FIG. 1A, the coherences will continue to precess under the field inhomogeneities, thus preventing complete refocusing.

In the vertical dimension, the spectra are symmetric with respect to \u03c91=0, because each transfer from spin S to I is accompanied by a transfer in the opposite direction. The central peak at \u03c91=0 arises from magnetization that is refocused but not transferred from one spin to another.",

Yet the results of the single-scan experiments according to the invention are virtually indistinguishable. The experiments have been repeated using several shim settings, invariably leading to similar spectra, as can be seen from the cross-sections in FIGS. 2E and 2F. As with all 2D single-scan experiments, the signal-to-noise ratio decreases in proportion to the square root of the number of points observed in the indirect dimension, when compared to a 1D spectrum taken under properly shimmed conditions. If the signal-to-noise ratio is poor, the experiments can be repeated for signal averaging, even if the B0 inhomogeneities vary in time, provided the fluctuations are slow compared to the time it takes to acquire each scan. For a simple one-dimensional spectrum, about 50 ms suffice. Thus, assuming that the information must be acquired within 10% of the period of the fastest fluctuations, the spectrum of the stochastic variations must be limited to 2 Hz. This should be useful for NMR spectra obtained in resistive Bitter or hybrid magnets, which suffer from random fluctuations due to the power supply and to low-frequency vibrations associated with the circulation of cooling water.",

This corresponds to a resolution of 76 Hz (0.13 ppm) over a frequency range of \u00b12500 Hz (\u00b14.2 ppm). The resolution of the spectra can be improved by increasing the amplitudes of both encoding and decoding gradients (provided the frequency sweep of the adiabatic pulses covers the frequency range induced by the encoding gradients) or, as shown in FIG. 3, by increasing nE and the strength of the decoding gradients. The frequency range can be increased by extending the sweep width of the adiabatic pulses, albeit at the expense of the resolution, unless one also increases the strength of both encoding and decoding gradients (27\u2014the content of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto). The resolution in the \u03c92 dimension is determined by the number nD of points acquired in the t2 dimension, like in other forms of 2D spectroscopy.",
                        "In order to mimic a gradient that cannot be switched off, the scheme of FIG. 1D has been applied, in the presence of a permanent gradient, or more accurately, a pulsed field gradient that was switched on before the experiment and stopped immediately after observing the signals has been applied. The echo corresponding to zero frequency appears at \u03c3C after the start of signal acquisition. Only one-dimensional spectra revealing combinations of chemical shifts in propanol have been recorded (to avoid using prolonged strong gradients). The sample height was decreased to 18 mm, so that the line-shape was further deteriorated by susceptibility effects at the edges. FIG. 4A shows the resulting spectra in the presence of a gradient Gz=2.75 G/cm (\u02dc35 ppm or 21 kHz across the sample). Signals arising from coherence transfer are indicated by arrows. The duration of the adiabatic pulses was 18 ms and their sweep width 40 kHz. When the gradient strength is doubled to 5.5 G/cm (\u02dc70 ppm or \u02dc42 kHz) together with a doubling of the adiabatic sweep width, there is some loss of intensity due to diffusion (FIG. 4B). These losses can be reduced with the scheme of FIG. 1E, as shown in FIG. 4C for a total of 6 adiabatic pulses of 6 ms duration (instead of two otherwise identical pulses of 18 ms each used for FIG. 4B). The line-width in FIG. 4C is about 70 Hz. Increasing the gradient strength further to 11 G/cm (\u02dc140 ppm or \u02dc84 kHz) leads to the spectrum in FIG. 4D. In this case, the signal amplitude suffers not only from diffusion losses, but also from the limited rf amplitude (25 kHz) of the initial \u03c0/2 pulse. In stronger gradients, one should use a large number of short inversion pulses that cover a very broad bandwidth with the desired phase-profile. In addition, the (possibly frequency swept) \u03c0/2 pulses should excite the full bandwidth uniformly, bearing in mind that a linear dependence of the phase with respect to offset is allowed."
