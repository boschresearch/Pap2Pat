In some embodiments, thin film multielectrode arrays can be produced with microfabrication techniques, such as photolithography. However, utilizing photolithography to pattern electrodes and other electronic components on a thin film or other flexible substrates (e.g., a wafer) can result in planar devices with relatively planar or flat electrodes.

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Thin film multielectrode arrays can be used in a wide variety of applications, including (but not limited to) in vitro cell culture, neural stimulation and/or recording in vivo, computer chip testing, and the like. These arrays can be produced using photolithography, which results in relatively compact and/or small-scale devices. By utilizing various photolithography techniques to pattern parts onto a thin film substrate, more flexible electrode arrays can be produced. Smaller electrode arrays (e.g., on a micron scale) may be desirable for multielectrode arrays that are implanted within the body (such as the brain).",
                        "However, traditional thin film lithography may only be able to produce relatively flat (e.g., planar) multielectrode arrays. In some instances, lithography techniques may be capable of producing slopes or rounded forms, but such shapes can require a large number of fabrication steps, thereby increasing a cost and fabrication time of such a device. Thus, producing multielectrode arrays comprising electrodes with a structure that is raised from a base of the substrate of the array (e.g., has a relatively high aspect ratio or surface area to footprint ratio), and having a specified shape based on a specified application, may not be possible with such fabrication techniques.",
                        "As an example, when used for tissue applications, such as implantation in the body (e.g., brain, heart, spinal cord, or the like), multielectrode arrays comprising relatively planar electrodes that sit on or against the surface of the tissue can have reduced effectiveness and applicability. For example, FIGS. 1A and 1B show an exemplary planar multielectrode array 10 (perspective view shown in FIG. 1B) that is configured to sit on a surface of the brain 12 (FIG. 1A). The planar multielectrode array 10 can comprise a plurality of separate, planar electrodes 14 which have a relatively low surface area to footprint ratio or aspect ratio (e.g., are not raised substantially or at all from a base surface of the array). For example, the electrodes 14 do not have a shape and height (e.g., in a direction out of the page) that allows them to penetrate into the surface of the tissue (e.g., of the brain 12 in FIG. 1A). As a result, the multielectrode array 10 is configured to sit on the surface of the tissue (e.g., brain tissue, as shown in FIG. 1A).",
                        "The more planar, 2D nature of the planar multielectrode array 10 (and similar multielectrode arrays) can cause scar tissue ingrowth to occur following implantation. This limits the electrode array's ability to form long-term electrical connections with the brain tissue. For example, scar tissue may form against the planar multielectrode array 10 implanted in the brain, thereby reducing its stimulation and/or recording capabilities and reducing its effectiveness for longer-term stimulation or recording applications (e.g., for deep brain therapy in patients with Parkinson's or other chronic neurological disorders).",
                        "Additionally, thin film, flat electrodes and electrode arrays, such as the planar multielectrode array 10, may have a lower electrode surface area and surface area to footprint ratio, and thus, deliver less charge or electrical potential. Thus, such arrays may utilize a larger number of electrodes and/or electrodes with increased width or diameter to increase the amount of charge they can deliver. However, this increases the overall footprint of the device (e.g., as shown in FIG. 1A, with the array 10 covering a large portion of the brain 12), thereby increasing a time to fabricate such a device and the scar tissue that may form as a result of implanting the device.",
                        "Further still, as mentioned above, since the electrodes of the planar multielectrode array 10 are planar, they cannot penetrate the tissue (e.g., brain tissue). As a result, the applications that they can be used for is limited (e.g., they cannot be used for deep brain stimulation) and they may not adhere to or anchor well to the tissue in which they are implanted. This can further limit their longevity for implantation in the body. Thus, thin film, planar multielectrode arrays, such as the planar multielectrode array 10 of FIGS. 1A and 1B, may not be able to stimulate the brain (or other anatomical tissue) effectively and for a longer period of time (e.g., months or years).",
                        "The present disclosure pertains to multielectrode arrays comprising raised electrode structures that are composed of a photopolymer that is coated in metal (thereby creating electrodes) and methods for manufacturing such arrays. In some embodiments, the raised electrode structures forming the electrodes of the multielectrode array can be 3D printed to have a height that extends outward from a base (e.g., substrate) of the multielectrode array. For example, electrode structures having a certain height can result in electrodes with a relatively high surface area to footprint ratio (and/or aspect ratio, such as an aspect ratio of at least 10:1). Thus, the multielectrode arrays described herein may be referred to as 3D multielectrode arrays.",

As introduced above, a higher electrode surface area, which can be achieved with a 3D printed 3D structure comprising a plurality of pores (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 8A-11C), can result in a device with increased surface area for electrical stimulation, thereby making the devices more effective without requiring a large device (substrate) footprint. Thus, smaller devices can achieve increased levels of electrostimulation. Additionally, 3D electrode arrays comprising 3D electrodes having a plurality of pores can promote tissue ingrowth into the pores of the electrodes, thereby increasing a longevity of the arrays. More specifically, by integrating pores or channels within the 3D printed structures of the 3D electrodes, enhanced tissue integration with the implanted 3D electrode or multielectrode array can be achieved. This tissue integration can reduce thresholds for stimulation and increase a longevity of the device when implanted (e.g., the 3D electrodes or electrode arrays can be implanted for a longer period of time while maintaining their stimulation and/or recording capabilities).",
                        "Further, in some embodiments, the porous or internal channel structure of the 3D electrodes of the multielectrode arrays can serve as scaffolds that are configured to receive various growth factors, such as vascular growth factors or neurotrophic factors which promote cell ingrowth with tunable selectively. For example, 3D electrodes formed from 3D printed structures comprising pores or internal channels (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, 9A, 10A, and 10B) can be seeded with neurotrophic factors and/filled with a hydrogel containing active materials (e.g., growth factors) and then implanted in the body. The growth factors (e.g., neurotrophic factors) can promote cell ingrowth from the native tissue at the implantation site into an interior of the 3D electrode(s) of the implanted device, thereby increasing a long-term stability of the implanted device. As a result, the implanted 3D electrode or multielectrode array can be used more effectively for a longer period of time (as compared to flatter electrodes or electrode arrays that do not include 3D electrodes formed from 3D printed structures comprising pores or internal channels, such as the exemplary planar electrode array 10 shown in FIG. 1A and array 50 shown in FIG. 1B).",
                        "In some embodiments, the specific growth factors or neurotrophic factors to be used within a 3D electrode or electrode array can be selected based on an intended implantation site and/or application. For example, the selection of the specific neurotrophic factors can induce the incorporation of inhibitory or excitatory neurons within the 3D electrode or electrode array.",
                        "Thus, 3D neurostimulation electrodes comprising selectively metallized 3D printed structures can have lower power consumption, an increased implantation lifetime, and a smaller footprint. Such 3D neurostimulation electrodes can be effective for a variety of applications, including (but not limited to) deep brain stimulation, close-loop feedback of neuromodulation, retinal implants, and the like.",
                        "Further, 3D recording electrodes comprising selectively metallized 3D printed structures can have long-term recording capabilities due to the features described above. For example, enhanced tissue integration of the implanted device with the native tissue at the implantation site, due to the specific geometries of the 3D printed electrodes described herein that allow for the incorporation and delivery of neurotrophic factors, can enhance the long-term performance of the 3D recording electrodes or multielectrode array. Additionally, by incorporating extension members (e.g., hooks) into the 3D printed structures of the 3D electrodes, the resulting device can be better anchored within the tissue at the implantation site. This can minimize any damage to the tissue at the implantation site that can be associated with electrode movement. By reducing movement between the 3D recording electrode and the native tissue, more effective and long-term recording (and stimulation for stimulation electrodes) can be accomplished, even when the subject is in motion.",
                        "As another example, 3D printed structures with higher aspect ratios and/or surface area to footprint ratios (such as an aspect ratio of at least 10:1) can penetrate the tissue where they are implanted, thereby reducing an immune response and providing better anchoring to the tissue, as well as being able to address deeper regions in the tissue. For example, FIGS. 23 and 30A-31 show examples of shank or spike-shaped structures for 3D electrodes that can have high aspect ratios. In some examples, these 3D structures, formed using the 3D printing methods described herein) can have a height in a range or 300-400 \u03bcm and a width (or diameter) or approximately 20 \u03bcm. In some examples, a base of the 3D structure can be approximately 40 \u03bcm and a tip of the 3D structure can be approximately 20 \u03bcm. In some examples, the 3D structures can have a height in a range of 150-400 \u03bcm with a sharper tip (such as those shown in FIGS. 30A-31, as described below). As such, the spike, conical, or shank-shaped electrodes described herein can be configured to penetrating the dura (of the brain or spinal cord) and be used in neural implants. For example, if the spike, conical, or shank-shaped 3D electrode was wider or shorter than described above, it may be unable to penetrate the dura.",
                        "In some embodiments, 3D recording or stimulation electrodes can be further insulated for recording or stimulation applications by applying an insulating material coating (such as Parylene C or amorphous Silicon Carbide (a-SiC)) on top of the metal surface of the 3D structure of the 3D electrode (e.g., following metallization of the 3D printed structure) and then exposing (by removing the insulating or Parylene or a-SiC coating from) only a metal tip (apex) of the 3D structure for electrical recording or stimulation. An exemplary method 1900 for creating insulated recording or stimulation electrodes with an exposed metal tip (for recording or stimulation) is shown in FIG. 22. Method 1900 follows a similar method as shown in FIG. 7. Thus, similar methods to those of FIG. 7 are labeled similarly in FIG. 22 and are not re-described below for the sake of brevity.",
                        "After creating the opening 728 in the sacrificial metal layer 718 to the underlying substrate 720 to expose a selected portion or exposed portion (e.g., print pad) 732 of the substrate 720 (as described above with reference to FIG. 7), the method continues on to 1902. At 1902, the method includes 3D printing a 3D structure 1908 onto the exposed portion 732 of the substrate 720. The 3D structure 1908 can have a conical, pyramidal, or spike (or shank) shape with a mesh (or logpile or porous) structured tip 1910 (e.g., the highly porous or mesh structure is added to an end or tip of the conical, pyramidal, or spike 3D structure 1908, thereby creating a tip 1910 with pores or channels and increased surface area). Alternatively, the 3D structure 1908 can have a conical, spike, or shank with a tapered tip that does not include a mesh structure.",
                        "The method at or following 1902 can then include applying a metal layer to the device with the 3D structure 1908 having the tip 1910 and then removing the sacrificial metal layer, as described above with reference to the methods at 714 and 716 of method 700 of FIG. 7.",
                        "The method 1900 then continues to 1904 where Parylene (Parylene C) or amorphous Silicon Carbide (a-SiC) (or another insulating material) is deposited across the device to create an insulating layer 1912 (of Parylene C or a-SiC, for example) over the metallized 3D structure 1908 and tip 1910. In some embodiments, a thickness of the insulating layer 1912 can be approximately 2 \u03bcm. This insulating layer 1912 electrically isolates both the electrical leads (traces) and the device itself from the environment.",
                        "In some embodiments, the method at 1904 can further include, prior to depositing the insulating material of the insulating layer 1912, electrodepositing iridium oxide (or a similar material such as platinum black or PEDOT) across the device to create increased surface roughness and/or increase the thickness of the metal on the device. The insulating material can then be deposited, as described above. Alternatively, in other instances, electrodepositing the iridium oxide material can be performed after the method at 1906 (as described below), thereby adding surface roughness and/or increased thickness to only the exposed metal tips of the 3D structures (electrodes).",
                        "At 1906, the method includes removing the insulating layer 1912 from only the tip 1910 of the 3D structure 1908 by exposing the portion of the insulating layer 1912 covering the tip 1910 to a laser (e.g., a 40 W femtosecond pulsed laser having micron resolution). As shown at 1906 in FIG. 22, this results in the exposure of the conductive metal at the tip 1910 for electrical recording or stimulation, while a remainder of the 3D structure 1908 (not at the tip) and the device remain covered by the insulating layer 1912 (and thus isolated from the environment).",

The tip 2106 comprises conductive metal and is porous, thereby providing a high surface area tip for recording and stimulation while a remainder of the device 2100 is insulated. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 24, the tip 2106 comprises pores while a remainder of the 3D structure of the 3D printed electrode 2102 is solid (e.g., not having pores).",

The substrate 2252 can include a silicon wafer 2254 (or other base substrate) that is covered by a polyimide layer 2256 (or another thin film material layer) (FIG. 29). For example, in the method 2250, prior to the sputtering the sacrificial metal layer 718 onto the substrate 2252, polyimide can be spun onto the surface of the silicon wafer 2254, as shown at 2251 (FIG. 29).

The methods 2200 and 2250 then include, at 706 and 708, photopatterning openings in the positive photoresist 722, thereby defining spaces for the electrical contacts and traces of the multielectrode array. For example, the methods can include patterning the positive photoresist 722 using a mask aligner (and direct write laser lithography system). After the positive photoresist 722 is exposed to a developer solution, the methods continue to 710 to etch through the sacrificial metal layer 718, thereby forming the mask (or spaces) for the final electrical traces and contacts and defining print pads 2260 on the substrate 2202 (FIG. 28) or the polyimide layer 2256 (FIG. 29).",

As described herein, in some examples, each 3D printed structure can have an aspect ratio of at least 10:1 and comprise a photopolymer. In other examples, each 3D printed structure can have an aspect ratio of at least 3:1 or 7:1. Additional examples of such 3D printed structures are shown in FIGS. 30A-31, as described further below.
