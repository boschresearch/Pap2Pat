                        "The current invention demonstrates a Silicon (Si) based mid IR super absorber with absorption (A) reaching 0.948. In one embodiment, the structure is composed of multilayered N-doped Si/Si hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) integrated with sub-hole Si grating. In another embodiment, the structure has a tunable absorption peak that can be tuned from 4.5 \u03bcm to 11 \u03bcm through changing the grating parameters. In a further embodiment, the invention includes two grating designs integrated with N-doped Si/Si HMM that can achieve wide band absorption. The first grating design is based on Si grating incorporating different holes' height with (A) varying between 0.83 and 0.97 for wavelength from 5 \u03bcm to 7 The second grating design is based on Si grating with variable holes' diameter; the latter shows broad band absorption with the maximum (A) reaching 0.97. Shown here is that the structure is omnidirectional. The current invention is an all Si based absorber, which demonstrates a good candidate for thermal harvesting application.",
                        "Demonstrated herein is a mid-IR Si based super absorber of total thickness not exceeding 1 microns using HMM integrated with sub-hole Si grating. Single band absorption was achievable with (A) reaching 0.948. The invention is able to tune the absorption peak over the mid-IR range from 4.5 to 11 \u03bcm by either changing the grating hole's height or by changing the hole's diameter. The disclosure confirms that the invention is an omnidirectional and less- polarization dependent absorber. One embodiment has profound application in bio and chemical sensing mechanisms based upon tuning the single absorption peak of predesigned grating. Show herein is that BBA can be achieved by using an all Si based structure. The disclosed two grating designs, namely: Si grating with different holes' height and Si grating with different holes' diameter, both are integrated with the N-doped Si/Si HMM. Both designs have acquired BBA with maximum (A) reaching 0.97. I For Metamaterial fabrication, standard chemical vapor deposition can be applied for Si layers deposition while ion beam irradiation can be used to dope the Si layers. For patterning both the periodic grating or the multiple diameters' hole grating, photolithography and deep reactive ion etching can be used. For grating of different hole heights', Nano imprint lithography can be used to pattern a stair case grating followed by photolithography and deep reactive ion etching. This absorber opens avenues for CMOS compatible energy harvesters for on chip purposes. The invention addresses the need for an on-chip CMOS compatible energy harvesters."
