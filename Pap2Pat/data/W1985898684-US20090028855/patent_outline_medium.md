### MATERIALS AND METHODS

- describe cell lines and NCI Diversity Set
- outline screening and assay procedures

### EXAMPLE 1

- motivate Akt inhibitor development
- describe API-1 identification and characterization
- show API-1 inhibits Akt kinase activity and phosphorylation

### EXAMPLE 2

- show API-1 does not inhibit upstream Akt activators

### EXAMPLE 3

- demonstrate API-1 selectivity for Akt over other kinases

### EXAMPLE 4

- show API-1 inhibits constitutively active Akt and downstream targets

### EXAMPLE 5

- demonstrate API-1 suppresses cell growth and induces apoptosis in Akt-overexpressing cells

### EXAMPLE 6

- show API-1 inhibits tumor growth in nude mice with elevated Akt levels
- demonstrate API-1 reduces phosphorylated Akt in treated tumors
