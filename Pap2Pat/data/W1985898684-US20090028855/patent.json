                        "Akt, also called protein kinase B, represents a subfamily of the serine/threonine kinase. Akt was first described as the cellular homologue of the product of the v-akt oncogene (Bellacosa et al. 1991), and it has three members, Akt1/PKB\u03b1, Akt2/PKB\u03b2 and Akt3/PKB\u03b3 (Cheng et al. 1992; Jones et al. 1991a; Jones et al. 1991b). Activation of Akt depends on the integrity of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which mediates its membrane translocation, and on the phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop and Ser473 (Konishi et al. 1995). Phosphoinositides, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, produced by PI3 K bind directly to the PH domain of Akt, driving a conformational change in the molecule, which enables the activation loop of Akt to be phosphorylated by PDK1 at Thr308 (Datta et al. 1999). Full activation of Akt is also associated with phosphorylation of Ser473 within a C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Datta et al. 1999). Although the role of PDK1 in Thr308 phosphorylation is well established, the mechanism of Ser473 phosphorylation is controversial. A number of candidate enzymes responsible for this modification have been put forvard, including integrin-linked kinase (Persad et al. 2001), PDK1 when in a complex with the kinase PRK2 (Wick et al. 2000), Akt itself, through autophosphorylation (Toker et al. 2000), DNA-dependent kinase (Feng et al. 2004), and the rictor-mTOR complex (Sarbassoy et al. 2005). The activity of Akt is negatively regulated by tumor suppressor PTEN, which is frequently mutated in human malignancy (Vazquez et Al. 2000). PTEN encodes a dual-specificity protein and lipid phosphatase that reduces intracellular levels of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 by converting them to PtdIns-4,5-P2, thereby inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway (Stambolic et al. 1998).",
                        "Akt phosphorylates and/or interacts with a number of molecules to exert its normal cellular functions, which include roles in cell proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation (Cheng et al. 2001). Many lines of evidence demonstrate that Akt is a critical player in the tumor development and progression. In addition, aberrant hyperactivation of Akt pathway has been detected in Lip to 50% all human tumors (Sun et al. 2001; Cheng et al. 1997) and is closely associated with chemoresistance (West et al. 2002). Therefore, Akt has been an attracting target for anti-cancer drug discovery (West et al. 2002).",
                        "In the last several years, through combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput and virtual screening, and traditional medicinal chemistry, a dozen inhibitors of the Akt pathway have been identified. Lipid-based inhibitors of Akt were the first to be developed, including perifosine (Kondapaka et Al. 2003), PX-316 (Meuillet et al. 2004) and phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues (Castillo et al. 2004), which were designed to interact with the PH domain of Akt. In addition, several Akt antagonists have been identified using high-tluioughput screening of chemical libraries and rational design. These inhibitors include 9-methoxy-2-methylellipticinium acetate (Jin et al. 2004), the indazole-pyridine A-443654 (Luo et al. 2005), isoform-specific allosteric kinase inhibitors (Lindsley et al. 2005) and Akt/PKB signaling inhibitor-2 (API-2), also called triciribine/TCN (Yang et al. 2004). API-2/TCN is a tricyclic nucleoside that previously showed antitumor activity in phase I and phase II trials conducted, but multiple toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia, precluded further development (Feun et al. 1993; Hoffman et al. 1996). By screen of the NCI diversity set, we have previously shown that API-2 inhibit Akt kinase activity and stimulate apoptosis of xenografts of human cancer cells exhibiting high Akt activity (Yang et al. 2004). This finding has provided new interest in studying this drug and raises the possibility that lower doses may inhibit Akt and induce tumor cell apoptosis without the previously associated side effects (Yang et at. 2004; Cheng et ct. 2005)."

In a xenograft nude mice model, compounds of the invention considerably inhibit tumor growth in the cells with hyperactivated Akt but not in the tumors with low levels of Akt.",

                        "The serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB pathway is frequently hyperactivated in human cancer and functions as a cardinal nodal point for transducing extracellular and intracellular oncogenic signals, and thus it presents a target for molecular therapeutics. By screening the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set, a small molecule Akt pathway inhibitor, APT (Akt/PKB signaling inhibitor)-1, was identified. API-1 inhibits the kinase activity and phosphorylationi level of three members of Akt family. However, it had no the effects on the activity of the upstream activators, PI3K and PDK1. Further, the kinase activity and phosphorylation levels of constitutively active Akt were largely inhibited by API-1 in cell culture, while it had no effect on Akt kinase activity in vitro. API-1 is highly selective for Akt and does not inhibit the activation of PKC, SGK, PKA, STAT3, Erk-1/2, or JNK. The inhibition of Akt by API-1 resulted in induction of cell growth arrest and apoptosis in human cancer cells that harbor constitutively activated Akt. Significantly, API-1 selectively inhibited tumor growth in nude mice of human cancer cells in which Akt is elevated but not of those cancer cells in which it is not. These data suggest that API-1 is an Akt pathway inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo and could be a potential anti-cancer agent for patients with cancer expressing hyperactivated Akt.",
                        "Akt is a maior pathway regulating cancer cell survival, growth and tumor progression. It has been well documented that elevated levels of Akt kinase contribute to resistance to various cancer therapies, including cell-toxic chemotherapeutic drugs and small molecule inhibitors of Bcr-Abl (Gleevec), Her2/Neu (Hercptin), and mTOR (rapamycin). Blocking Akt inhibits tumor growth in the cancer cells with hyperactivated Akt and renders cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy and other targeted therapies. Combination of API-1 with other anti-tumor drugs provides more potent anti-tumor effects."

A recent study identified a recurring somatic mutation in PH domain of AKT1 in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket (Carpten et al. 2007). Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 through pathological localization. to the plasma membrane, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. Further, the E17K substitution reduces the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor (Carpten et al. 2007). As E40K-AKT1 mutant is similar to E17K which can localize in the plasma membrane (Bellacosa et al. 1998), API-1 may also inhibit E17K-AKT1.",

                                "Due to the fact that aberrant activation of Akt pathway occurs in almost 50%( all the human malignancy and inhibition of Akt induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis, it has drawn interest from industry and academia to develop small molecule Akt inhibitor for anti-cancer drug discovery (Cheng et al. 2005; Granville et al. 2006). While a dozen Akt inhibitors have been reported, many of them lack anti-tumor activity in vivo. A lipid-based Akt inhibitor, perifosine, has been reported in phase I and II studies (Van Ummersen et al. 2004; Bailey et al. 2006). However, in neither study was modulation of Akt assessed. A recent phase II study of perifosine in pancreatic cancer was terminated as a result of unacceptable adverse events during the first stage (Marsh et al. 2007). Nevertheless, there is a need to develop potent selective Akt inhibitors that are void of inhibiting other kinase activities with minimal adverse effect. To identify small molecule inhibitor(s) of Akt, we have evaluated a chemical library of 1,992-compounds from the NCT (the NCI Diversity Set) for agents capable of inhibition of growth in AKT2-transformed but not empty vector LXSN-transfected NIH3T3 cells as described in \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d. Triple experiments showed that 32 compounds inlibited growth only in AKT2-transformed cells. We previously characterized one of them, named API-2/triciribine that is a pan-Akt inhibitor with anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo and currently in phase I clinic trail (Yang et al. 2004).",
                                "In the present study, we showed that Akt/PKB inhibitor-1 (API-1) specifically inhibits kinase activity and phosphorylation levels of Akt in living cells. FIG. 1A shows the chemical structure of API-1 (-NSC 177223), which has no chemical name and has not been tested in NCI 60 cell lines (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/). Since APT-1 inhibited selectively AKT2 transformed cells over untransformed parental cells, we first examined whether API-1 is an inhibitor of AKT2 kinase and whether it also inhibits other two members of Akt. HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged wild type Akt1, AKT2 and AKT3. Following serum starvation for overnight, cells were treated with APT-1 for 60 min prior to EGF stimulation and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assay. FIG. 1B shows that API-1 suppressed insulin-induced kinase activity of Aktl, AKT2 and AKT3. We next examine if API-1 inhibits Akt in living calls. OVCAR3 cells, which express elevated levels of phosphor-Akt, were treated with different doses of API-1 for 3 hours. Immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Akt-S473 antibody showed that API-1 efficiently reduced phosphorylation level of Akt and IC5o is approximately at 0.8 AM. However, total Akt levels were no change (FIG. l C). Further, we examined if API-1 directly inhibits Akt kitiase activity in vitro. Recombinant constitutively active Akt protein was incubated with Akt/SGK substrate peptide (Upstate) in a kinase buffer containing different amounts of API-1 and compound E, a pan-kinase ATP-competitor inhibitor including Akt, as positive control. Triple experiments showed no effect of APT-1 on Akt kinase activity (Figure ID), suggesting that API-1 does not directly inhibit Akt in vitro and that API-1 functions neither as ATP nor substrate competitor."

                                "Akt is activated by extracellular stimuli and intracellular signal molecules through a PI3K-dependent manner, which is negatively regulated by PTEN. Activation of PI3K or mutation of PTEN will activate PDKl leading to induction of Akt kitase activity. Therefore, APT-1 inhibition of Akt could result from targeting upstream molecule(s) of Akt, such as PI3K and PDK1. To this end, we next examined if APT-1 inhibits PI3K and/or PDKT. HEK293 cells were serum-starved and then treated with API-1 or PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, for 1 hour prior to EGF stimulation. PI3K was immunoprecipitated with anti-p110\u03b1 antibodv. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro PI3K kinase assay using PI-4-P as a substrate. As shown in FIG. 2A, the EGF-induced Pl3K activity was inhibited by wortmannin but not by APT-1. To evaluate the effect of APT-1 on PDK1, we performed in vitro PDKI kinase assay using SGK kinase as readout (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Unlike PDK1 inhibitor UCN-01 (Sato et al. 2002), API-1 had no effect on in vitro PDK1 kinase activity (FIG. 2B). To further evaluate the effect of API-1 on PDK1 activation in living cells, we examined phosphorylation level of PDK1-Ser241, a residue that is autophosphorylated and is critical for its activity (Casamayor et al. 1999), following API-1 treatment of OVCAR3 cells. FIG. 2D shows that phosphorylation levels of PDKl were not inhibited by API-1."

                                "Akt belongs to AGC (PKA/PKG/PKC) kinase family, which also include PKA, PKC, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), p90 nhbosomal S6 kinase, p70S6K, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase and PKC-related kinase. Among AGC kinase family, protein structtures of PKA, PKC and SGK are much closer to Akt kinase than other members. Therefore, we next examined the effects of API-1 on the enzymatic activities of these 3 kinascs. In vitro PKA kinase assay and SGK kinase assay was performed by pre-incubated indicated dose of API-1 or specific inhibitor with recombinant PKA or SGK protein for 30 minutes before starting kinase assay by adding kemptide or Akt/SGK substrate peptide and [\u03b3-32] ATP in kinase buffer. Iii vitro kinase assay showed that the kinase activities of PKA and SGK were inhibited by PKAI and compound E respectively, whereas API-1 exhibited no effect on their activities (FIGS. 2C and 2E). To further evaluate the effect of API-1 on the PKA and PKCc activation in living cells, OVCAR3 cells were treated with indicated doses of API-1 or specific inhibitor of PKA and PKC, immunoblotting analysis showed that phosphorylation levels of PKA and PKC were not inhibited by API-1 (FIG. 2D). In addition, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged SGK. In vitro kinase assay showed that EGF-induced SGK kinase activity was attenuated by wortmannin but not API-1 (FIG. 2F).",

If this is authentic, API-1 should also inhibit activation of constitutively active Akt since its activation still requires phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 (Sun et al. 2001). To test this hypothesis, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged Myr-Aktl -Akt2 and\u2014Akt1E40K. Following serum starvation overnight, cells were treated with or without API-1. Myr-Akt1, Myr-Akt2 and Akt1-E40K were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kiniase assay and immunoblotting analysis with anti-phospho-Akt-T308 antibody. FIG. 3A shows that in vitro Akt kinase activitv as well as phosphorylation levels of My -Akt1, MyT-Akt2 and Akti-E40K were inhibited by API-1, supporting the notion that API-1 might bind to Akt molecule to prevent it from activation within the cells.",

                                "Akt is a major pro-growth and pro-stu-vival pathway. Cancer cells with elevated Akt kinase exhibit more resistant to chemotherapeutic drug-induced cell growth arrest and cell death whereas knockdown Akt sensitizes to apoptosis induced by different proapoptotic stimuli (Solit et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003; Jetzt et al. 2003). The ability of API-1 to selectively inhibit the Akt pathway suggests that it should inhibit proliferation and/or induces apoptosis preferentially in those tumor cells with aberrant expression/activation of Akt. To test this, API-1 was used to treat the cells that express constitutively active Akt, caused by overexpression of Akt (OVCAR3, OVCAR8, MCF7 and PANC1) or mutations of the PTEN gene (MDA-MB-468PC-3 and LNCaP), and cells that do not (OVCAR5, MDA-MB-435s, DU-145 and COL0357). Immunoblotting analysis showed that phosphorylation levels of Akt were significantly inhibited by API-1 in the cells expressing elevated Akt while phospho-Akt was also reduced by API-1 in the cell lines exhibiting low levels of Akt (FIG. 4A and data not shown). However, API-1 induces PARP cleavage and inhibits cell growth in a much higher degree in Akt-overexpressing/activating cells as compared to those with low levels of Akt (FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C). API-1 treatment inhibited cell proliferation by approximate 50-70% in Akt-overexpressing/activating cell lines, OVCAR3, OVCAS, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7, whereas only by about 10-30% in OVCAR5, and MDA-MB-435s cells (FIGS. 4B and 4C). Moreover, API-1 Induces apoptosis by 9-fold and 4.6-fold in OVACAR3 and MDA-MB-468, respectively, whereas much less apoptosis was observed in API-1-treated OVCAR5 and MDA-MB-435s cells (FIGS. 4D-4G). Thus, API-1 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis preferentially in the cells that express aberrant Akt."

                                "It has previously been shown that aberrant activation and overexpression of Akt are frequently detected in human ovarian and pancreatic cancer (Cheng et al. 1992) and that autisense of Akt significantly inhibits tumor cell growth and invasion (Cheng et al. 1996). Further, inhibition of Akt pathway by inhibitors of P13K, HSP70, Src and farnesyltransferase resulted in cell growth arrest and induction of apoptosis (Solit el al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003). Because API-1 inhibits Akt signaling and induces apoptosis and cell growth arrest in cancer cells with elevated levels of Akt (FIGS. 4A-4G), it was reasoned that the growth oftumors with elevated levels of Akt should be more sensitive to API-1 than that of tumors with low levels of A-kt in nude mice. To this end, Akt-overexpressing cells (OVCAPR3 and PANC-1) were s.c. implanted into the left flank, and those cell lines that express low levels of Akt (OVCAR5 and COL0357) were s.c. implanted into the right flank of mice. When the tumors reached an average size of about 100-150 mm3, the animals were randomized and treated ip. with either vehicle or API-1 (10 mg/kg/day). As illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5J, OVCAR3 and PANC1 tumors treated with vehicle control continued to grow. API-1 inhibited OVCAR3 and PANC1 tumor growth by 70% and 50%, respectively (FIGS. 5C-5F and 5G-5J). In contrast, API-1 had little effect on the growth of OVCAR5 and COLO357 cells in nude mice (FIGS. 5A-5J). At dose 10 mg/kg/day, API-1 had no effects on blood glucose level, body weight, activity and food intake of mice (data not shown). In treated tumor samples, phosphorylation levels of Akt were reduced by API-1 about 70% without change of total Akt content (FIGS. 5K-5L). Taken together, these results indicate that API-1 selectively inhibits the growth of tumors with elevated levels of Akt.",
