### MATERIALS AND METHODS

- introduce cell lines and NCI Diversity Set
- describe screening for inhibition of Akt-transformed cell growth
- outline in vitro protein kinase, cell survival, and apoptosis assays
- describe antitumor activity in nude mouse tumor xenograft model

### EXAMPLE 1

- motivate development of small molecule Akt inhibitor
- describe screening of NCI Diversity Set for Akt inhibitor
- characterize API-1 as Akt/PKB pathway inhibitor
- show API-1 inhibits kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt
- demonstrate API-1 does not directly inhibit Akt in vitro
- conclude API-1 is a selective Akt inhibitor

### EXAMPLE 2

- examine if API-1 inhibits upstream activators of Akt
- show API-1 does not inhibit PI3K and PDK1

### EXAMPLE 3

- evaluate selectivity of API-1 for Akt over AGC kinase members
- show API-1 does not inhibit PKA, PKC, and SGK
- demonstrate API-1 does not affect other oncogenic survival pathways

### EXAMPLE 4

- investigate if API-1 inhibits constitutively active Akt
- show API-1 inhibits downstream targets of Akt
- conclude API-1 interacts with Akt protein to prevent phosphorylation

### EXAMPLE 5

- examine effect of API-1 on cell growth and apoptosis in Akt-overexpressing cells
- show API-1 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in Akt-overexpressing cells
- demonstrate API-1 has less effect on cells with low levels of Akt

### EXAMPLE 6

- describe tumor xenograft model in nude mice
- show API-1 inhibits growth of tumors with elevated levels of Akt
- demonstrate API-1 has little effect on tumors with low levels of Akt
- show API-1 reduces phosphorylation levels of Akt in treated tumors
- conclude API-1 selectively inhibits growth of tumors with elevated levels of Akt
