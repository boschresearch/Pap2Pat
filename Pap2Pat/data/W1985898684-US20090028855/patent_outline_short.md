### MATERIALS AND METHODS

- describe cell lines and screening methods

### EXAMPLE 1

- identify small molecule Akt/PKB pathway inhibitor API-1

### EXAMPLE 2

- examine if API-1 inhibits upstream activators of Akt

### EXAMPLE 3

- evaluate selectivity of API-1 for Akt over other kinases

### EXAMPLE 4

- investigate API-1 inhibition of constitutively active Akt and downstream targets

### EXAMPLE 5

- test API-1 effects on cell growth and apoptosis in Akt-overexpressing cancer cell lines

### EXAMPLE 6

- evaluate API-1 inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice with elevated Akt levels
