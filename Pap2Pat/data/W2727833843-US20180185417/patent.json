                        "In order for cell therapies to be translated from the bench to the clinic, they must follow good manufacturing practice guidelines and be approved by regulatory agencies. In the case of exogenous cell therapies, significant regulatory constraints on cell isolation and in vitro expansion procedures to ensure the quality and safety of the resultant product lead to high costs (Li et al., Expert opinion on biological therapy. 2015; 15(9):1293-306; Riis et al., Expert Rev Mol Med. 2015; 17: e11). An alternative approach is to use endogenous cells, obtained from the subject to be treated. Approaches have been developed to obtain a sufficient number of cells for therapy, such as cytokine-based cell mobilization, e.g., the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (Griese et al., Circulation. 2003;108: 2710-2715). However, not only does this approach necessitate several visits to the hospital for injections or to collect cells, but it is also associated with a wide variety of side-effects ranging from flu-like symptoms to more severe conditions (Ozkan et al., Transfus Apher Sci. 2015; 3(1):13-6).",
                        "In contrast, intraoperative cell therapies, in which cells are harvested from a patient prior to or during an operation, and then are re-administered, often during the same surgical session, represent a new class of exciting approaches that hold promise to overcome the high costs and many of the potential drawbacks associated with ex vivo cell expansion and cytokine-based cell mobilization. Such intraoperative approaches have the potential to save time and reduce costs for both patients and clinicians (FIG. 1).",
                        "However, current approaches for positive cell isolation usually employ magnetic beads for separation, for examples, magnetic beads that are coupled with high-affinity antibodies. These beads remain attached to the cells that are to be transplanted. Although magnetic bead and/or antibody-based cell separation approaches are useful for selection of cells in a laboratory setting, they are not ideal for isolation of cells for administration to a subject (e.g., cell therapy) because of the presence of contaminants in the isolated cell population, including residual antibody, residual beads, and/or chemical agents. In both Europe and the USA, modification of transplanted cells, including the use of antibodies or antibody-labeled beads that are not removed, may constitute more than a minimal manipulation. The resulting cells could consequently be classified as an advanced-therapy medicinal product (ATMP), resulting in substantially greater regulatory burden. Accordingly, new approaches for cell isolation are needed."

                        "The present invention provides devices, methods, and kits for enriching cells with a specific cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, from a mixed cell population. The invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that cells bound to an aptamer which specifically recognizes a cell surface protein can be released from the aptamer using mechanical forces, e.g., shear forces, in the absence of any chemical agent to disrupt binding. The device described herein for cell enrichment includes an aptamer suitable for specifically binding the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31. The device can also contain beads having a diameter of about 30-200 \u03bcm. The aptamer can be coupled to the beads in a manner that allows for release of selected cells having the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, using mechanical forces, in the absence of a chemical agent. The resulting cell population released from the aptamer is enriched for cells containing the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, and is substantially free of beads, antibodies, and aptamer. Cells that are enriched or isolated using the device can be used in any application in which an enriched or isolated population of cells is desired.",
                        "Due to the rapid nature of cell enrichment using the device, and the lack of beads, antibody, or aptamer on the enriched cells, the device is ideal for intraoperative enrichment of cells obtained from a subject, which are to be administered to a subject during a surgical procedure. Use of the device for intraoperative cell enrichment is illustrated herein using the example of bone healing.",
                        "In the US, approximately 7.9 million bone fractures are reported each year with 5 to 10% resulting in an impaired bone-healing situation (Wu et al., Orthopedic Research and Reviews. 2013 (5): 21-33; Mills et al., BMJ open 2013;3(2). pii: e002276). Predicting patients at risk and initially providing them with additional treatment may significantly reduce the number of non-union cases, and decrease the associated costs and hospital stay (Dahabreh et al., Injury. 2007;38: 371-377). Harvesting autologous cells, and intraoperatively enriching them using the device described herein to obtain an appropriate cell population for delivery to the fracture location may improve bone regeneration and bone healing. An exemplary cell population useful for promoting bone healing in a subject is enriched for CD31+cells.",
                        "In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined.",

The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201ccontaining\u201d are to be construed as open-ended terms (i.e., meaning \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d) unless otherwise noted. Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value recited or falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited.",

In one embodiment, an \u201cisolated\u201d cell is substantially free of other cells. A population of cells can also be \u201cisolated\u201d from cells having differing characteristics. For example, cells that express a particular cell surface antigen can be isolated from cells that do not express the cell surface antigen. An isolated population of cells is free or substantially free of cells that do not possess the characteristic of interest. For example, an isolated population of CD31+ cells is free or substantially free of cells that do not express CD31. A cell or population of cells can also be isolated from contaminants, such as reagents used to grow or purify the cell(s), e.g., culture media, beads, antibody, aptamer, etc.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cenriched\u201d in reference to a population of cells refers to a population of cells in which the proportion of cells possessing a desired characteristic has been increased relative to the proportion of cells possessing the desired characteristic in a starting population of cells. The starting population can include, for example, the natural source material of the cells, e.g., blood.

An exemplary aptamer suitable for use in the invention is 10-15 kDa in size (about 30-45 nucleotides), specifically binds its target, e.g., a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31, and discriminates against closely related targets (e.g., will typically not bind other proteins from the same gene family).",

Aptamer synthesis is inexpensive and highly reproducible. For example, aptamers used in the devices of the invention can be produced by solid phase chemical synthesis, an accurate and reproducible process with consistency among production batches. An aptamer can be produced in large quantities by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and, once the sequence is known, can be assembled from individual naturally occurring nucleotides and/or synthetic nucleotides.

                                "In one embodiment, the invention provides devices for enriching a cell population with cells that express a cell surface marker of interest, e.g., CD31. The device contains an aptamer capable of specifically binding the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31, coupled to a solid support. For example, the aptamer can be coupled to beads having a diameter greater than the diameter of the cells to be enriched, wherein the aptamer is coupled to the beads in a manner that allows for release of cells with the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, in the absence of a chemical agent. The device optionally comprises a filter containing a pore size smaller than the diameter of the beads, and larger than the diameter of the cells to be enriched. The device can optionally comprise a column containing the beads and the filter. In some embodiments, the column is fitted with a syringe. In some embodiments, the column can be sized to fit in a centrifuge tube. In some embodiments the device further comprises a centrifuge tube housing the column. The device allows production of a cell population enriched for cells expressing a cell surface marker of interest, e.g., CD31, substantially free of beads and aptamer.",

In other embodiments, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of leukocytes. In another embodiment, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of a tumor cell.",
                                "Exemplary cell surface markers suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, T-cell receptor (TCR), CD2, CD3, CD5, CD4, CD8, complement receptors, Fc receptors, MHC Class II molecules, membrane immunoglobulin, CD31, CD11, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD24, CD28, CD29, CD34, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD49, CD53, CD57, CD68, CD84, CD90, CD97, CD117, CD133, CD155, CD166, CD200, CD244, CD300, CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, CCR8, CXCR1, CXCR4, CXCR6, CX3CR1, ESA, P63, stem cell antigen, NCAM, Thy-1, c-Kit, Flt-3, and/or combinations thereof.

                                "The foregoing cell surface markers are provided as an illustration of the vast number of cell surface markers that may be used in the devices of the present invention, and is not intended to be limiting.",
                                "In some embodiments, the beads are packed in a column. In other embodiments, the beads are present in a suspension and collected by centrifugation. The column containing the beads can be of a size and character to allow release of cells without removal of beads. In some embodiments, the column can be of a volume of about 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 5 mL, 6 mL, 7 mL, 8 mL, 9 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 40 mL, 50 mL, 60 mL, 70 mL, 80 mL, 90 mL, 100 mL, 500 mL, 1000 mL, etc. To facilitate removal of cells from beads, the column can be sized to fit in a centrifuge tube, for example, a small eppendorf tube or a large falcon tube, such that cells can be collected by centrifugation using either a tabletop centrifuge or a large centrifuge. When beads are packed in a column, the column can contain a filter with pores sized to allow cells to pass through while retaining beads in the column. In one embodiment, the filter has a pore size smaller than the diameter of the beads. In another embodiment, the filter has a pore size larger than the diameter of the cells to be enriched. In a some embodiments, the filter has a pore size of, for example, about 10-100 \u03bcm, e.g., about 10 \u03bcm, 20 \u03bcm, 30 \u03bcm, 40 \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm, 60 \u03bcm, 70 \u03bcm, 80 \u03bcm, 90 \u03bcm, or 100 \u03bcm. In other embodiments, the filter has a pore size of about 10-50 \u03bcm, about 10-30 \u03bcm, about 10-25 \u03bcm, about 10-20 \u03bcm, or about 10-15 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the filter has a pore size of less than 10 \u03bcm.",
                                "The size of beads that are used in the device can vary. In some embodiments, the bead is larger than a cell. In other embodiments, the beads are larger than the pore size of the filter. In some embodiments, the beads have a diameter of about 30-200 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the beads have a diameter of about 30-150 \u03bcm. In other embodiments, the beads have a diameter of about 50-150 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the beads have a diameter of about 20 \u03bcm, 30 \u03bcm, 40 \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm, 60 \u03bcm, 70 \u03bcm, 80 \u03bcm, 90 \u03bcm, 100 \u03bcm, 110 \u03bcm, 120 \u03bcm, 130 \u03bcm, 140 \u03bcm, 150 \u03bcm, 160 \u03bcm, 170 \u03bcm, 180 \u03bcm, 190 \u03bcm, or 200 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the beads have a diameter greater than 200 \u03bcm. In further embodiments, the beads are packed in a column. When beads are packed in a column containing a filter, it can be advantageous to use beads having a diameter larger than the diameter of the pores in the filter, so that the beads will not pass through the filter, and will be retained in the column.",
                                "The beads used in the devices and methods described herein can comprise any standard material known in the art to suitable for cell-based chromatography, for example, agarose beads, sepharose beads, polystyrene beads, etc. In exemplary embodiments, the beads are not magnetic.",
                                "Regulatory agencies have expressed concerns regarding the suitability of cells enriched using magnetic beads substantially smaller than the cell diameter (e.g. beads having a diameter in the nanometer to micrometer range) for clinical use. Concerns include the possibility of beads contaminating the final product, or phagocytosis of the beads by the cells. The devices described herein overcome such concerns by preferably using beads larger than the diameter of the cells to be enriched, eliminating the possibility that the beads will be phagocytosed, and preferably using a filter having a pore size smaller than the diameter of the beads and larger than the diameter of the cells to be enriched, allowing beads and cells to be easily separated.",
                                "Beads can be easily separated from the captured cells of interest by applying mechanical forces, without the addition of any other reagents. As a result, the isolated cell population is free or substantially free of beads, aptamer, antibody, or any other undesired reagents. In some embodiments, mechanical forces can be applied to the beads without removing them from the column. Release of captured cells, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be accomplished by, for example, resuspension in a buffer, shaking, pipetting, or vortexing the aptamer-coupled beads. In other embodiments, the column is fitted with a syringe. The syringe can be used to mechanically agitate the beads/cells, thereby disrupting the interaction between beads and cells. The use of mechanical force to separate cells from the aptamer coated beads allows the bound cells to be released without adding any extraneous reagents that could subsequently contaminate the cell population and limit the use of the cell population in clinical applications.",
                                "In other embodiments, captured cells can be released from the device using a change in temperature. For example, the beads can be exposed to a temperature sufficient to denature the aptamer. In the case of a nucleic acid-based aptamer, cells can be released by exposure to temperatures of about 95\u00b0 C. or greater for a period of time sufficient to denature nucleic acid, e.g., about 1 minute, about 2 minutes, about 3 minutes, about 4 minutes, about 5 minutes, etc. In some embodiments the period of time is about 5-10 minutes. In other embodiments, the period of time is about 20 minutes. In other embodiments, the period of time is 30 minutes or less. In applications where it is desirable to obtain an enriched population of viable cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, the cells are exposed to elevated temperatures for a minimal amount of time sufficient to denature the nucleic acid aptamer and release the cells, without significantly impacting cell viability.",
                                "In other embodiments, captured cells can be released from the device using a nucleic acid molecule complementary to all or a part of the nucleic acid aptamer. Complementary nucleic acid molecules can compete for binding to the aptamer with cells containing the antigen, causing release of cells when the aptamer binds to the complementary nucleic acid.",
                                "Temperature and/or complementary nucleic acid can be used to release cells from the aptamer independently or in conjunction with mechanical disruption, as described herein.",
                                "The aptamer can be coupled to the solid support, e.g., beads, in a manner suitable for release of cells expressing the antigen bound by the aptamer, e.g., CD31+ cells, in the absence of a chemical agent, to thereby produce a cell population enriched for cells expressing the antigen substantially free of beads and aptamer. Interaction between aptamer and beads should be sufficiently strong to allow release of the cells using mechanical force without removing the aptamer from the beads. Such an interaction can be accomplished by non-covalently coupling the aptamer to the beads. For example, the aptamer can be non-covalently coupled to the beads through interaction of streptavidin and biotin. In one embodiment, the aptamer is biotinylated, the beads are coupled to streptavidin, and the aptamer is coupled to the beads through the interaction of biotin and streptavidin. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the aptamer is coupled to streptavidin, and the beads are biotinylated. A person skilled in the art will recognize that other moieties can be substituted for streptavidin and retain the binding capacity for biotinylated ligand, e.g., avidin, NeutrAvidin, etc. In some embodiments, interaction between aptamer and beads can be accomplished by covalently coupling the aptamer to the beads. In some embodiments, the aptamer is present at a concentration of about 1-50 \u03bcg aptamer/mL beads, e.g., 10-40 \u03bcg/mL, 20-50 \u03bcg/mL, 30-50 \u03bcg/mL, 5-10 \u03bcg/mL, 5-25 \u03bcg/mL, or 10-20 \u03bcg/mL. In one embodiment, the aptamer is present at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL. Aptamer may be loaded on beads using any art-recognized method. For example, the anti-CD31 aptamer may be attached to the beads by suspending the beads in a aptamer containing solution followed by a 20 minute incubation at 4\u00b0 C. The aptamer coupled beads can be subsequently collected by centrifugation.",
                                "After release from the beads, selected cells, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be recovered from the beads, using any suitable method. In embodiments in which the device contains a column fitted with a filter having pores of a diameter intermediate to that of the cells and the beads, released cells can be recovered by separation through the filter. Upon passing through the filter, cells can be collected and recovered, e.g., by centrifugation. The recovered cell fraction is enriched for cells that express the cell surface marker bound by the aptamer. In some embodiments, the recovered cell fraction is substantially free of cells that do not express the cell surface marker bound by the aptamer. In such embodiments, the recovered cell fraction expressing the cell surface marker of interest has been isolated from cells that do not express the cell surface marker. Cells enriched, purified, or isolated using the devices described herein are advantageously free or substantially free of beads, aptamer, antibody, nuclease, or any additional agents that are added to facilitate the release of cells, avoiding the possibility of a potential contaminant remaining in the final cell suspension.",
                                "In some embodiments it can be advantageous to use a mixture of beads coupled to the aptamer and beads not coupled to the aptamer. The presence of a large quantity of aptamer coupled beads may spatially block the interaction between cells and the beads. As such, mixing aptamer-free beads with aptamer-coupled beads may reduce, to some extent, the steric hindrance while maintaining sites for interaction between the aptamer and cells expressing the cell surface marker of interest, e.g., CD31+ cells. The ratio of aptamer-coupled beads to aptamer-free beads in the devices of the invention include, but are not limited to, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1, or 20:1. In exemplary embodiments, the ratio of aptamer-coupled beads to aptamer-free beads is 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1. In other embodiments, the ratio of aptamer-coupled beads to aptamer-free beads in the devices of the invention include, for example, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20.",
                                "In an exemplary embodiment, the device contains beads coupled to an aptamer that binds CD31. Such a device can be used to enrich and/or isolate CD31+ cells from a mixed cell population (e.g., whole blood, peripheral blood, suction blood from a wound site, etc.).",
                                "In some embodiments, the device is portable. A portable device is capable of being transported and can, for example, be easily carried or conveyed by hand. A portable device for cell purification, isolation or enrichment is advantageous as the device can be transported easily such that the procedure can be performed at any location where the device can be fitted. For example, the portable device can be used during the course of a surgical procedure and be carried from one surgical room to another. In some embodiments, the device is a closed system.",
                                "In some embodiments, the device is prepackaged in a sterile container. A sterile container is free from living germs or microorganisms, e.g., an aseptic container. As such, cells isolated using the device can be administered directly to a subject, for example, to the subject by introduction at a surgical site. Enriched cell populations can be administered at the site of any type of injury. For example, cell populations enriched for CD31+ cells can be administered to the subject at the site where osteogenesis and/or angiogenesis is desired, e.g., the site of a bone fracture, or a site of non-union. In some embodiments, the cell populations enriched for cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, are administered by injection.",
                                "Although the invention is described herein with respect to devices which comprise aptamers coupled to beads which are suitable for enriching cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, the present invention may, in some embodiments, include devices which comprise any antigen binding moiety, e.g., antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, (e.g., an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof that weakly binds antigen), integrin, DNA, RNA, small molecule, natural ligand, etc. coupled to a bead for enriching live cells from a mixed cell population. Thus, for example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a device for enriching live cells from a broader population based on one or more desirable surface antigens which comprises one or more ligands which interact with the target antigen(s) in a relatively weak/reversible manner (e.g., with a Kd of 10\u22123 to 10\u22127 M, e.g., a Kd of about 10\u22123, 10\u22124, 10\u22125, 10\u22126, 10\u22127 M); and beads having a diameter of about 30-200 \u03bcm; wherein the ligand or ligands are coupled to beads and collectively adhere to target cells via a multitude of weak/reversible interactions. The cells may be released from the ligands and beads by disrupting their collective interactions with or without additional chemical agents, producing a cell sub-population enriched for the antigens of interest but substantially free of beads and ligands.",
                                "The devices described herein are exemplified using aptamer-coupled beads. Other solid supports can, in some embodiments, be used in place of beads for performing cell enrichment. For example, in some embodiments, the device can contain microfluidic or tube-based solid support coupled to the aptamer."

                                "The present invention also provides methods for enriching cells that express a cell surface marker of interest from a mixed cell population, i.e., population of cells that contains cells expressing the antigen of interest, and cells that do not express the antigen of interest. The method involves providing aptamer-coupled beads, wherein the aptamer specifically binds a cell surface marker of interest; contacting the aptamer-coupled beads with a mixed cell population; washing the aptamer-coupled beads with a wash buffer such that unbound cells (i.e., cells without the cell surface marker), are removed from the cell sample; subjecting the aptamer-coupled beads to a mechanical force sufficient to release bound cells (i.e., cells expressing the cell surface marker) from the aptamer-coupled beads; and recovering the cells expressing the cell surface marker, from the aptamer-coupled beads. In this manner, a cell population that is enriched in cells expressing a cell surface marker is produced. Preferably, the enriched cell population is free or substantially free of beads and/or aptamer. In some embodiments, the enriched cell population is substantially free of cells that do not express the cell surface marker of interest. In such embodiments, the method produces an isolated cell population of cells expressing the antigen of interest.",
                                "The aptamer-coupled beads can be contacted with the mixed cell population for a period of time sufficient for the aptamer to specifically bind the antigen of interest expressed on the surface of a subpopulation of the cells. In embodiments, the aptamer-coupled beads are allowed to remain in contact with the mixed cell population for a period of about 1-30 minutes or more, e.g., at least about 1 minute, at least 2 minutes, at least 3 minutes, at least 4 minutes, at least 5 minutes, at least 6 minutes, at least 7 minutes, at least 8 minutes, at least 9 minutes, at least 10 minutes, at least 12 minutes, at least 15 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 25 minutes, at least 30 minutes or more. In one embodiment, the aptamer-coupled beads are allowed to remain in contact with the mixed cell population for 30 minutes or more. In one embodiment, the aptamer-coupled beads are allowed to remain in contact with the mixed cell population for a period of about 45 minutes. In one embodiment, the aptamer-coupled beads are allowed to remain in contact with the mixed cell population for a period of about 60 minutes. In another embodiment, the aptamer-coupled beads are allowed to remain in contact with the mixed cell population for less than one minute. Preferably, the aptamer-coupled beads are contacted with the mixed cell population for the minimal time within which the aptamer can specifically bind the antigen of interest. The time of incubation sufficient for the aptamer to specifically bind the antigen of interest may be related to some extent to the temperature at which the binding occurs. In exemplary embodiments, binding of cells expressing an antigen of interest to an aptamer occurs at 4\u00b0 C.-37\u00b0 C. In one embodiment, binding occurs at about 4\u00b0 C. In another embodiment, binding occurs at room temperature (e.g., about 21\u00b0 C.-23\u00b0 C.). In one embodiment, binding occurs at about 4\u00b0 -23\u00b0 C.",
                                "The methods of the present invention are suitable for enriching cells with any cell surface marker of interest. In some embodiments, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of B cells. In other embodiments, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of T cells. In some embodiments, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of monocytes. In other embodiments, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of leukocytes. In another embodiment, the cell surface marker is expressed on the surface of a tumor cell. Exemplary cell surface markers suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, T-cell receptor (TCR), CD2, CD3, CD5, CD4, CD8, complement receptors, Fc receptors, MHC Class II molecules, membrane immunoglobulin, CD31, CD11, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD24, CD28, CD29, CD34, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD49, CD53, CD57, CD68, CD84, CD90, CD97, CD117, CD133, CD155, CD166, CD200, CD244, CD300, CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, CCR8, CXCR1, CXCR4, CXCR6, CX3CR1, ESA, P63, stem cell antigen, NCAM, Thy-1, c-Kit, Flt-3, and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cell surface marker is CD31.",
                                "Captured cells expressing the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be released from the aptamer-coupled beads using mechanical forces, as described herein. In some embodiments, mechanical forces can be applied to the beads without removing them from the column. Release of cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be accomplished by, for example, resuspension in a buffer, shaking, pipetting, or vortexing the aptamer-coupled beads. In some embodiments, the mechanical force is applied by resuspension of the aptamer-coupled beads in a resuspension buffer, wherein the resuspension buffer does not contain an agent capable of releasing the cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, from the aptamer-coupled beads. Agents capable of releasing cells from beads during cell-based chromatography are known in the art. In one embodiment, the agent is a nuclease. In another embodiment, the agent is a protease. In another embodiment, the agent is DNase. In an alternative embodiment, the agent is RNase. In one embodiment, the agent is a complementary strand of an aptamer. Accordingly, in embodiments, the cells are released from the beads in the absence of agents including nucleases, proteases, DNases, RNases, and/or nucleic acid complementary to the aptamer, and combinations thereof. The resuspension buffer can be any water-based salt solution known in the art that has an osmolarity and ion concentration that are suitable for use with cells of the human body. In one embodiment, the resuspension buffer is phosphate buffered saline (PBS).",
                                "In other embodiments, captured cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be released from the device using a change in temperature. For example, the beads can be exposed to a temperature sufficient to denature the aptamer. In the case of a nucleic acid-based aptamer, cells can be released by exposure to temperatures of about 95\u00b0 C. or greater for a period of time sufficient to denature nucleic acid, e.g., about 1 minute, about 2 minutes, about 3 minutes, about 4 minutes, about 5 minutes, etc. In some embodiments the period of time is about 5-10 minutes. In other embodiments, the period of time is about 20 minutes. In other embodiments, the period of time is 30 minutes or less. In applications where it is desirable to obtain an enriched population of viable cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, the cells are exposed to elevated temperatures for a minimal amount of time sufficient to denature the nucleic acid aptamer and release the cells.",
                                "In other embodiments, captured cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be released from the device using a nucleic acid molecule complementary to all or a part of the nucleic acid aptamer. Complementary nucleic acid molecules can compete with cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, for binding to the aptamer, causing release of cells when the aptamer binds to the complementary nucleic acid.",
                                "Temperature and/or complementary nucleic acid can be used to release cells from the aptamer independently or in conjunction with mechanical disruption, as described herein. The foregoing method can be performed using any embodiment of the device described herein. For example, the beads can be packed in a column, or present in a suspension. In some embodiments, the column containing the beads can be of a size and nature to allow release of cells without removal of beads. The column can be of a volume of about 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 5 mL, 6 mL, 7 mL, 8 mL, 9 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 40 mL, 50 mL, 60 mL, 70 mL, 80 mL, 90 mL or 100 mL. To facilitate removal of cells from beads, the column can be sized to fit in a centrifuge tube, for example, a small eppendorf tube or a large falcon tube, such that the beads can be collected by centrifugation using either a tabletop centrifuge or a large centrifuge. When beads are packed in a column, the column can contain a filter with pores to allow cells to pass through while retaining beads in a column. In one embodiment, the filter has a pore size smaller than the diameter of the beads. In another embodiment, the filter has a pore size larger than the cells to be enriched. In an exemplary embodiment, the filter has a pore size of, for example, less than 30 \u03bcm, less than 25 \u03bcm, less than 20 \u03bcm, less than 15 \u03bcm, or less than 10 \u03bcm. In other embodiments, the column is fitted with a syringe. The syringe can be used to mechanically disrupt the interaction between beads and cells in the absence of any additional reagents, and to control the flow rate during the cell enrichment procedure.",
                                "In embodiments where the aptamer-coupled beads are provided in a column, the method can further comprise a step of passing the mixed cell population through the column. The flow rate of the column can be controlled to allow the cells to contact the aptamer-coupled beads for a period of time sufficient for cells expressing the antigen of interest to bind the aptamer. A fast flow rate will not provide enough time for cells to interact with aptamer-coupled beads. Alternatively, non-specific binding between the aptamer and cells without the specific cell surface marker, e.g., CD31\u2212 cells, may occur as a result of a slow flow rate. In exemplary embodiments, the cells are run through the column at a flow rate of about 5-100 \u03bcL/min. In another exemplary embodiment, the cells are run through the column at a flow rate of about 50 \u03bcL/min. In another exemplary embodiment, the cells are run through the column at a flow rate of 100 \u03bcL/min, 95 \u03bcL/min, 90 \u03bcL/min, 85 \u03bcL/min, 80 \u03bcL/min, 75 \u03bcL/min, 70 \u03bcL/min, 65 \u03bcL/min, 60 \u03bcL/min, 55 \u03bcL/min, 50 \u03bcL/min, 45 \u03bcL/min, 40 \u03bcL/min, 35 \u03bcL/min, 30 \u03bcL/min, 25 \u03bcL/min, 20 \u03bcL/min, 15 \u03bcL/min, 10 \u03bcL/min or 5 \u03bcL/min.",
                                "Beads used in methods described herein may have various sizes. In some embodiments, the beads are larger than a cell. In other embodiments, the beads are larger than the pore size of the filter. In some embodiments, the beads have a diameter of about 30-200 \u03bcm. In other embodiments, the beads have a diameter of about 50-150 \u03bcm, or a diameter of about 100-150 \u03bcm. For example, the beads have a diameter of about 50 \u03bcm, 60 \u03bcm, 70 \u03bcm, 80 \u03bcm, 90 \u03bcm, 100 \u03bcm, 110 \u03bcm, 120 \u03bcm, 130 \u03bcm, 140 \u03bcm or 150 \u03bcm.",
                                "The composition of the beads can also vary. Any standard beads known in the art for cell-based chromatography can be used in the method described herein, for example, agarose beads. Alternatively, the beads are sepharose beads. Another example of the beads is a polystyrene bead, for example, polystyrene beads from the company Spherotech. In an exemplary embodiment, the beads are not magnetic. The use of larger and non-magnetic beads for enriching cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ populations, as described herein is highly advantageous when compared to existing technologies, as cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, isolated using the compositions and methods described herein are free or substantially free of beads, aptamer, antibody, or any other reagents that are added to facilitate the release of cells, avoiding the possibility of a potential contaminant remaining in the final cell suspension. As a result, cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, isolated using the devices and methods described herein are suitable for direct and immediate administration to a subject without any additional purification or characterization steps.",
                                "The aptamer used in the foregoing methods is an aptamer suitable for specifically binding a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31, as described herein. The aptamer can be coupled to the beads in a manner suitable for release of cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD3130  cells, in the absence of a chemical agent, and production of a cell population enriched for cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, substantially free of beads and aptamer. Interaction between aptamer and beads should be sufficiently strong to allow release of the cells using mechanical force without removing the aptamer from the beads. Accordingly, the strength of the interaction between the aptamer and the beads should be significantly stronger than the strength of the interaction between the aptamer and the target antigen. Such an interaction can be accomplished by non-covalently coupling the aptamer to the beads. For example, the aptamer is non-covalently coupled to the beads through a streptavidin and biotin interaction. The aptamer is biotinylated, the beads are coupled to streptavidin, and the aptamer is coupled to the beads through the interaction of biotin and streptavidin.",
                                "Alternatively, the aptamer is coupled to streptavidin, the beads are biotinylated and the aptamer is coupled to the beads through the interaction of biotin and streptavidin. A person skilled in the art will recognize that other moieties can be substituted for streptavidin and retain the binding capacity for biotinylated ligand, e.g., Avidin, NeutrAvidin. In some embodiments, interaction between aptamer and beads can be accomplished by covalently coupling the aptamer to the beads. In some embodiments, the aptamer is present at a concentration of about 1-50 \u03bcg/mL, e.g., 10-40 \u03bcg/mL, 20-50 \u03bcg/mL, 30-50 \u03bcg/mL, 5-10 \u03bcg/mL, 5-25 \u03bcg/mL, or 10-20 \u03bcg/mL. In an exemplary embodiment, the aptamer is present at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL. Aptamer may be loaded on beads using any art-recognized method. For example, the anti-CD31 aptamer may be attached to the beads by suspending the beads in a aptamer containing solution followed by a 20 minute incubation at 4\u00b0 C. The aptamer coupled beads can be subsequently collected by centrifugation.",
                                "In some embodiments, the methods use a mixture of beads coupled to the aptamer and beads not coupled to the aptamer. The ratios between aptamer-coupled beads and aptamer-free beads used in the methods of the invention include, but not limited to, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5. In exemplary embodiments, the ratio of aptamer-coupled beads to aptamer-free beads is 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1. In exemplary embodiments, the method can be performed using a device as described herein.",
                                "After release from beads, cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be recovered from the aptamer-coupled beads by passage through a filter having a pore size of, for example, less than 30 \u03bcm, less than 25 \u03bcm, less than 20 \u03bcm, less than 15 \u03bcm, or less than 10 \u03bcm. Upon passing through the filter, cells can be collected and recovered by centrifugation. In one embodiment, the method is performed in the absence of an antibody specific for a cell surface marker, e.g., an anti-CD31 antibody.",
                                "Cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, may be enriched and/or isolated from a whole blood sample, a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample, a bone marrow sample, a hematoma sample, a tissue sample collected at the site of a bone fracture, a fluid sample collected at the site of a bone fracture, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cell population containing cells with and without the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ and CD31\u2212 cells, is enriched and/or isolated from a blood sample. In other embodiments, the cell population containing cells with and without the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ and CD31\u2212 cells, is enriched and/or isolated from is a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample. In some embodiments, the cell population containing cells with and without the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ and CD31\u2212 cells, is enriched and/or isolated from a tissue sample collected at the site of a bone fracture. In other embodiments, the cell population containing cells with and without the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ and CD31\u2212 cells, is enriched and/or isolated from a fluid sample collected at the site of a bone fracture, In yet another embodiment, the cell population containing cells with and without the cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ and CD31\u2212 cells, is enriched and/or isolated from a combination of a blood sample, a tissue and/or fluid sample collected at the site of a bone fracture.",
                                "In some embodiments it is desirable for the enrichment method described herein to be performed over a short duration of time. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the enrichment method described herein can be performed in 15-60 minutes or less, e.g., 15 minutes or less, 30 minutes or less, 45 minutes or less, or 60 minutes or less. In some embodiments, the enrichment method is performed in 2 hours or less. In an exemplary embodiment, the enrichment method is performed in 30 minutes or less. In one embodiment, the enrichment method is performed during a surgical procedure.",
                                "In one embodiment, the method further comprises obtaining the cell sample from a subject. The cell sample can be obtained from the subject using any suitable method. In exemplary embodiments, a blood sample is obtained from the subject. In another embodiment, a tissue sample is obtained from the subject. In another embodiment, a suction sample containing blood and/or tissue is obtained from the subject, e.g., by suction of a site within the subject, e.g., a surgical site, a site of injury, etc. In one embodiment, the cell sample is obtained from the subject prior to a surgical procedure, e.g., less than one hour, within 1 hour, within 2 hours, within 3 hours, within 5 hours, within 10 hours, within 12 hours, within 24 hours of a surgical procedure. In another embodiment, the cell sample is obtained from the subject during surgery.",
                                "In one embodiment, the method further comprises administering the enriched or isolated cell population to the subject. The enriched or isolated cell population can be administered to the subject by standard means, to a location within the subject where the enriched cell population is expected to provide a clinical benefit. For example, cells enriched for expression of CD31 can be administered to the site of a bone fracture, where they are expected to facilitate bone healing. In one embodiment, the starting population of cells is obtained from a subject, enriched using the methods described herein, and the enriched population of cells is administered to the subject, during the course of a surgical procedure. For example, a starting population of cells (e.g., a blood sample, etc.) can be obtained from a subject during or shortly before a surgical procedure. The cells can be enriched while the surgical procedure is performed, and the enriched cells can be administered to the subject during the surgical procedure. Accordingly, the cell enrichment method can be performed intraoperatively.",
                                "Cells enriched, purified or isolated using the methods described herein are free or substantially free of beads, aptamer, antibody, or any other agents or contaminants. As such, the cell population enriched for cells expressing a cell surface marker have the potential to be administrated directly to a subject, without the need for additional purification steps. For example, the cell population enriched for cells expressing a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be administered to the subject by introduction at a surgical site. In exemplary embodiments, the cell population enriched for cells expressing a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be administered to the subject at a site of injury. For example, a cell population enriched for cells expressing a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, can be administered at a site that would benefit from angiogenesis and/or osteogenesis, for example, the site of a bone fracture. Other therapeutic applications of the enriched cell population are described herein.",

                                "In some embodiments, it is desirable to further enrich a cell population for more than one cell surface markers, as described herein. For example, it may be desirable to enrich a cell population for cells containing CD31 and a second cell surface marker. Enrichment for a second cell surface marker may be performed using a solid support (e.g., beads) coupled to an aptamer which specifically binds the second cell surface marker. Cells bound by the aptamer can be released from the solid support using methods described herein, for example, mechanical disruption. Alternatively, enrichment for a second cell surface marker may be performed using other methods known in the art, for example, antibody-based methods, methods using magnetic beads, etc.",
                                "Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods described herein may further involve enriching a cell population for a second cell surface marker. In one embodiment, enrichment for CD31 and enrichment for a second cell surface marker are performed sequentially. For example, a cell population may be enriched for CD31 using the methods set forth herein, and the CD31+ enriched cell population may then be enriched for the presence of a second cell surface marker. Alternatively, a cell population may be enriched for a second cell surface marker, and the cells enriched for the second cell surface marker can subsequently be enriched for CD31 using the methods set forth herein. Such methods of successive enrichment will produce a cell population enriched for cells that contain both cell surface markers, i.e., cells that express both CD31 and the second cell surface marker.",
                                "In other embodiments, enrichment for CD31 and enrichment for a second cell surface marker are performed simultaneously. For example, a cell population may be enriched by binding the cells to a solid support (e.g., beads) which contains an anti-CD31 aptamer and a ligand (e.g., an aptamer) that binds the second cell surface marker. In one embodiment, the cell population is bound to beads that are coupled to an anti-CD31 aptamer and an aptamer that specifically binds the second cell surface marker. In another embodiment, the cell population is bound to beads that are coupled to an anti-CD31 aptamer, mixed with beads that are coupled to an aptamer that binds the second cell surface marker. Such methods of simultaneous enrichment will produce a cell population enriched for cells that contain either antigen, i.e., cells that express either CD31 or the second cell surface marker."

                                "The enriched cells that express a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, used in the methods provided herein may be mixed with or seeded onto a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to administration. \u201cPharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means that the compound or composition is suitable for administration to a subject to achieve the treatments described herein, without unduly deleterious side effects in light of the severity of the disease and necessity of the treatment. Such formulations can be prepared using techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application 2003/0180289; Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Alfonso R. Gennaro, editor, 20th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, Pa., 2000. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both (e.g., hydrogels), and can be formulated with the cells as a unit-dose formulation. In some embodiments the cells are provided as a suspension in the carrier to reduce clumping of the cells. In other embodiments cells are seeded onto a biodegradable scaffold or matrix. A \u201cbiodegradable scaffold or matrix\u201d is any substance not having toxic or injurious effects on biological function and is capable of being broken down into is elemental components by a host. The scaffold or matrix may be porous to allow for cell deposition both on and in the pores of the matrix. Such formulations can be prepared by supplying at least one cell population to a biodegradable scaffold to seed the cell population on and/or into the scaffold. The seeded scaffold may then implanted in the body of a recipient subject.",
                                "Formulations of the invention include those for parenteral administration (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, percutaneous injection) by injection or implantation. In one embodiment, administration is carried out intravascularly, either by simple injection, or by injection through a catheter positioned in a suitable blood vessel, such as a renal artery. In some embodiments, administration is carried out by \u201cinfusion\u201d, whereby compositions are introduced into the body through a vein (e.g., the portal vein). In another embodiment, administration is carried out as a graft to an organ or tissue to be augmented as discussed above, e.g., kidney, liver, or a bone-fracture site etc.",
                                "In some embodiments, the cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, are administered by injection of the cells (e.g., in a suitable carrier) directly into the tissue or organ of a subject that is in need of augmentation (e.g., at a surgical site). For example, cells may be injected into the kidney, liver, or a bone-fracture site. The functional effects of the cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, will be systemic, and the cells with a cell surface marker, e.g., CD31+ cells, may therefore be administered by injection into other organs or tissues in proximity to that to be augmented.",
                                "According to some embodiments, the cells administered to the subject may be syngeneic (i.e., genetically identical or closely related, so as to minimize tissue transplant rejection), allogeneic (i.e., from a non-genetically identical member of the same species) or xenogeneic (i.e., from a member of a different species), as above, with respect to the subject being treated. Syngeneic cells include those that are autogeneic (i.e., from the subject to be treated) and isogeneic (i.e., a genetically identical but different subject, e.g., from an identical twin). In a preferred embodiment, the cells are autogenetic. Cells also may be obtained from, e.g., a donor (either living or cadaveric) or derived from an established cell strain or cell line. As an example of a method that can be used to obtain cells from a donor (e.g., a potential recipient of a bioscaffold graft), standard biopsy techniques known in the art may be employed. Alternatively, cells may be harvested from the subject, expanded/selected in vitro, and reintroduced into the same subject (i.e., autogenic).",

The therapeutically effective dosage of cells will vary somewhat from subject to subject, and will depend upon factors such as the age, weight, and condition of the subject and the route of delivery. Such dosages can be determined in accordance with procedures known to those skilled in the art. In general, in some embodiments, a dosage of 1\u00d7105, 1\u00d7106 or 5\u00d7106 up to 1\u00d7107, 1\u00d7108 or 1\u00d7109 cells or more per subject may be given, administered together at a single time or given as several subdivided administrations. In other embodiments, a dosage of between 1-100\u00d7108 cells per kilogram subject body weight can be given, administered together at a single time or given as several subdivided administration. If necessary, subsequent, follow-up administrations also may be given.",
                                "Cells may be administered according to some embodiments to achieve a target hematocrit range. The ideal or target hematocrit range may vary from subject to subject, depending upon, e.g., specific comorbidities. In some embodiments the target hematocrit is from 30-40%, in some embodiments the target hematocrit is from 33-38%, and in some embodiments the target hematocrit is from 33-36%. Upon administration of cells according to the present invention, hematocrit may be measured and, if desired or necessary, corrected by, e.g., further implantation of cells and/or other methods known in the art. Other methods of treatment for promoting angiogenesis, promoting osteogenesis, promoting immunomodulation, and treating bone fracture may be used in conjunction with the methods of treatment provided herein, for example, other cell-based therapies, other angiogenesis promoting agents, other osteogenesis promoting agents, other immunomodulation promoters, and other bone fracture treatments.",

                                "For the initial studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from apheresis leukoreduction filters using traditional density centrifugation method. The Brigham and Women's hospital specimen bank provided the samples from consented patients. The cell suspension was diluted with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 1:1 before being layered onto density centrifugation medium (Ficoll-paque plus, VWR, #17-1440-02) and centrifuged for 30 min at 400 g without brake. The PBMCs layer was aspirated and rinsed twice at 200 g for 8 min to remove platelets. PBMCs were then used for subsequent aptamer validation or frozen for system optimization experiments. For magnetic bead studies and system validation, fresh whole blood samples were purchased from Research Blood Components (Boston, Mass.) and diluted with an equal volume of PBS+2% fetal calf serum. PBMCs were obtained by following the manufacturer's instruction with the Sepmate procedure (Stem Cell Technologies, #15460).\n\n\n- Aptamer Specificity",
                                "A commercially available biotinylated aptamer for CD31 was purchased (APTSCI, #CD31-2196BCI). To validate its specificity, PBMCs were resuspended at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. 100 \u03bcl of cells were incubated with the biotinylated aptamer at different concentrations for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1200RPM and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl flow cytometry staining buffer (eBioscience, #00-4222-26). Cells were stained for CD31 (Alexa fluor 488, CD31, Biolegend, #303110) and biotin (PE anti-biotin antibody, Biolegend, #409004) before being analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa with HTS.\n\n\n- Magnetic Bead Studies",
                                "To benchmark the new approach, established and commercially available bead sorting strategies were used as comparison. In certain studies, CD31+ cells were isolated by immunomagnetic cell separation (MACS System; Milteny Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instruction using the CD31 Microbead kit (Milteny Biotec, #130-091-935). For the aptamer, magnetic cell sorting was performed using a cell isolation kit for CD31+ cells (APTSCI, #CD31-2196BCI) and following the manufacturer's instruction.\n\n\n- In Vitro Characterization: Flow Cytometry Analysis",
                                "In order to analyze the different populations, cells were resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer at 107 cells/ml and stained for CD14 (Biolegend, #325628), CD45 (Biolegend, #304006), CD31 (Biolegend, #303116), CD3 (Biolegend, #300308) and CD19 (Biolegend, #302208) and analyzed on BD LSRFortessa. For all analysis, the initial gating on PBMCs was performed using FSC and SSC parameters. Subsequently, CD31+ levels were analyzed. For the CD31+ cells composition, gating was performed on CD31+ cells and composition with regards to monocytes (CD14+), T cells (CD3+) and B cells (CD19+) was evaluated.\n\n\n- System Assembly",
                                "A tube based system was developed for cell enrichment. Microcentrifuge tubes (Pierce, #69705) served as the basis for the system. Using tweezers, polyethylene filters were removed from the tubes. Then, biopsy punches (Sklar Instruments, #96-115) were used to extract 4 mm diameter filters from 20 um cell strainers (Pluriselect, # 43-50020-03). A thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue (E-Z bond, #S-105) was applied to the base of the microcentrifuge tubes. The punched-out filter was then applied to the base of the tube and pressed slightly using tweezers. The system was then left to dry overnight at room temperature. Neutravidin agarose beads were packed within the tube: neutravidin agarose beads (Piercenet, #29204) were diluted in PBS with calcium and magnesium and filtered through a 100 \u03bcm filter (Falcon, #352360). Remaining beads in the filter were then collected. The beads solution was allowed to settle before being resuspended in PBS. After a quick centrifugation step (1 min, 300 g), beads were resuspended in a solution of biotinylated aptamers and incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. After incubation, the tube was centrifuged and washed twice in PBS to remove unbound aptamer. Two additional rinsing steps were performed before finally resuspending in 600 \u03bcl of binding buffer (APTSCI, #CD31-2196BCI) and transferring beads to the tube. In certain studies, unmodified and aptamer coated beads were mixed and used in the columns. Luer-lock adaptors allowed these columns to be used with BD biosciences syringes.\n\n\n- Isolation Procedure: From PBMCs to CD31+ Enriched Cell Population",
                                "The PBMCs were run through the enrichment system at 50 \u03bcl/min, at a concentration of 2.5\u00d7107 cells/ml in binding buffer for 10 min. During that step, the whole system was kept vertical during the duration of the experiment to alleviate issues related to cell sedimentation due to the small diameter of lml syringes. Another 500 \u03bcl of binding buffer was then run through at the same speed, before rinsing using 3 ml of PBS at 300 \u03bcl/min to remove unbound cells. An infusion syringe pump was used to control the flow-rate (Braintree Scientific, #BS300). The system was then disconnected from the syringe and beads were resuspended by sucking in and out of 1 ml syringe with an 18GA needle (VWR, KT868280-1801). This approach dispersed the beads in solution and resulted in the release of the cells. The tube was centrifuged in a 2 ml eppendorf tubes at 300 g for 3 min to collect the released cell population. Cell viability was measured using the Muse\u00ae Cell Analyzer.\n\n\n- Conditioned Medium Studies",
                                "Conditioned medium from the initial PBMCs population and released cell population was prepared to assess their angiogenic and osteogenic potential. Cells were cultivated in EBM basal medium (Lonza, #CC3121) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrome) for the former and in DMEM low Glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrome) for the latter. 1.2\u00d7106 cells were kept in 6 ml of medium over 24 hours. The medium was then sterile filtered and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further experiments.\n\n\n- In-Vitro: Angiogenic Potential The angiogenic potential of the cells\n  was assessed using a tube formation assay. 96-well plates were coated\n  with 50 \u03bcl/well of Matrigel growth factor reduced (VWR, \\#354230) and\n  transferred to a 37\u00b0 C. cell culture incubator to allow the gel to\n  solidify. In the meantime, a single cell suspension of human umbilical\n  vein endothelial cells (HUVECS, Lonza, \\#CC2519) between passage 3 and\n  5, at 2\u00d710\u2075cells/ml was prepared. 50 \u03bcl of the cell suspension was\n  added to each well in culture medium without angiogenesis activators\n  or inhibitors. Cells were allowed to adhere for 20 minutes before\n  adding 150 \u03bcl of conditioned medium. The plate was then incubated\n  overnight. Networks of cell structures were examined under a\n  microscope and images were taken at 10\u00d7. The total length of the\n  network per image was evaluated using ImageJ and divided by the\n  results obtained for the HUVECS cultured in culture medium without\n  angiogenesis activators or inhibitors. For a positive control, the EGM\n  bullet kit was used (Lonza, \\#CC3124).\n- In-Vitro: Osteogenic Potential",
                                "Mesenchymal stromal cells were purchased from ATCC (#PCS-500-012). Cells from passage 3-4 were used for the experiments. In brief, 2.4\u00d7104 cells per well were seeded in a 96 well-plate and cultivated in expansion medium for 24 hours before induction. Commercially available osteogenic differentiation medium (LifeTechnologies, #A10072-01) was purchased and diluted 1:1 with conditioned media and 100 \u03bcl medium were applied to each well with biweekly medium exchange. At the end of the study cell proliferation was evaluated using a redox-based metabolic assay (AlamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent, LifeTechnologies), and the osteogenic differentiation visualized via Alizarin Red S staining (ARS). The stained wells were rinsed repeatedly with PBS. Then, matrix-bound ARS was dissolved by addition of 10% cetylpyridinium chloride before measuring absorption at 562 nm. The resulting values were normalized to the values obtained from alamar blue and divided by the values of the control cell group cultured in regular osteogenic differentiation medium."

                                "A 2D cell adhesion assay was performed to examine the capacity of different ligands to capture and release CD31+ cells. Three different ligands were investigated: an anti-CD31 antibody (Biolegend, 27333), recombinant human integrin \u03b1\u03b2f33 (R&D systems, 3050-AV-050), and a commercially available aptamer (Aptamer Sciences Inc., Pohang, Gyoungbuk, South Korea). To optimize the ligand concentration, five different concentrations of each ligand were tested, including 0 \u03bcg/mL, 0.1 \u03bcg/mL, 1 \u03bcg/mL, 5 \u03bcg/mL and 10 \u03bcg/mL. Each ligand was coated on Maxisorp 96 well plate (Nunc, 442404) at the desired concentration by passive adsorption and incubated over night at 4\u00b0 C. Two washes were performed using PBS before blocking with 0.2% Pluronic F-127 (89139-290) for one hour at 37\u00b0 C. The plate was then rinsed twice using 200 \u03bcL PBS before adding peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 5\u00d7104 cells/well. The plate was incubated for one hour at 4\u00b0 C. and then 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. 200 \u03bcL of room temperature PBS was added to each well using a syringe pipette, and buffer was aspirated to remove non-adherent cells from well. Care was taken to leave approximately 50 \u03bcL in the plate to not disturb the adherent cells. The washes were repeated three times. Subsequently, cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% PFA before being stained with DAPI (Biolegend, 422801). Pictures were taken under 10\u00d7 magnification using an Evos\u00ae FL inverted microscope. Cell counting was performed using Image J to extract adherent cell density.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 2A, without blocking agent, cells can adhere to the Maxisorp 96 well plate. However, pluronic F-127 prevented cell adhesion almost completely. Increasing the concentration from 0.1 to 10 \u03bcg/mL resulted in an increase in the amount of cells captured. All three different ligands showed a saturation of cell density at 5 \u03bcg/ml. Therefore, this value was used to analyze the purity of non-adherent (NA) and released (R) cell populations.",
                                "For cell release, the same procedure as described before was used until the washing steps. During the washing steps, all non-adherent cells were collected. For each experiment, cells from 12 wells were combined to obtain a sufficient number of cells for staining. Released cells (R) cells were collected when pipetting the whole volume of the well four times. Resuspension took place in the absence of any chemical agents that would facilitate the release of cells from the ligands, such as nucleases, and was done using PBS. Non-adherent (NA) and released (R) cells were then stained for CD31 (Alexa fluor 488 CD31 (Biolegend, 303110) and quantified using flow cytometry. CD31 levels in NA cells and R cells are summarized in FIG. 2B. As shown in FIG. 2B, there was a decrease in the number of CD31+ non-adherent cells in wells coated with the aptamer ligand. A corresponding increase in the level of CD31+ cells was observed in the released fraction in wells containing the anti-CD31 aptamer ligand, indicating that the anti-CD31 aptamer specifically bound CD31+ cells, and indicating that the CD31+ cells were released upon application of mechanical force through resuspension. An anti-CD31 antibody had a greater capacity for capturing cells relative to the aptamer, however, it was not possible to detach CD31+ cells from the anti-CD31 antibody-coated wells using mechanical force.",
                                "In order to validate the specificity of the CD31 aptamer, PBMCs were resuspended at a concentration of 107cells/ml. 100 \u03bcl of cells were incubated with the biotinylated version of aptamer for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 RPM and suspended in 100 \u03bcL flow cytometry staining buffer (ebioscience, 00-4222-26). Cells were stained for CD31+ (Alexa fluor 488 CD31 (Biolegend, 303110) and biotin (PE anti-biotin antibody) before being analyzed on BD LSRFortessa. Raw data can be observed on FIG. 2C as well as quantification. Data showed that the aptamer was highly specific for the CD31 population (94.4\u00b13.5 to 97.1\u00b14.3% of the aptamer marked cells were CD31+ positive for the different concentration of aptamer used), with the sensitivity going up to 99.0\u00b11.3% for an aptamer concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml (FIG. 2D). In addition, the specificity was also high with values between 96.9\u00b14.1% and 87.9\u00b14.8 for aptamer concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml and 5 \u03bcg/ml respectively (FIG. 2D). Also, at a concentration high enough, most of the CD31+ cells were marked (at 5 \u03bcg/ml only 1.9\u00b12.2% of CD31+ remained unlabeled, FIG. 2C).",
                                "To finish validating the aptamer, its capacity to concentrate CD31+ cells from a population containing a mixture of CD31 positive and negative cells was evaluated. The aptamer was coated onto magnetic beads (\u00d8=1 um) according to the procedure described in the magnetic isolation kit provided by APTSCI to allow capture of CD31+ cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). For this, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 100 mL whole blood samples using density centrifugation method (Ficoll-Paque plus). The blood was diluted with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged for 30 min at 400 g without brake.

The aptamer-based isolation and commercial antibody isolation resulted in similar enrichment of CD31+ cells. In both cases, a high enrichment of CD31+ cells was observed (initial population Cd31+ levels: 69\u00b18%, after aptamer-based isolation: 91\u00b110%, after MACS isolation: 99.7\u00b10.1%)"

                                "A general outline of the system is as follows: PBMCs that contains a mixture of CD31\u2212 and CD31+ cells were run through the system. The CD31+ cells adhered to the aptamer coated beads while CD31\u2212 flowed through and were discarded. CD31+ cells were then released from beads with a syringe by imposing fluid shear with a simple mixing of the beads with attached cells and additional medium. Cells released were then collected by centrifugation (FIG. 3A).\n\n\n- System Characteristics",
                                "Microcentrifuge tubes (Pierce, #69705) served as a basis. Using tweezers, polyethylene filters were removed from the tubes. Then, biopsy punches (Sklar Instruments, 96-115) were used to obtain 4 mm diameter filters from a 20 \u03bcm cell strainer (Pluriselect).",
                                "Filters were then glued to the base of the tubes and let to dry overnight at room temperature. Neutravidin agarose beads (Piercenet, #29204) were packed within the tube and coated with a CD31 aptamer (Aptamer Sciences Inc., Pohang, Gyoungbuk, South Korea). Filtering of the neutravidin agarose beads through 100 \u03bcm cell strainer makes it impossible for the beads once packed in the tube to go through the 20 \u03bcm filter attached. Luer-lock adaptors allowed these columns to be used with BD biosciences syringes (1 ml and 3 ml syringes). Flow-rate was controlled by placing the syringe on an infusion syringe pump (Braintree Scientific, BS300). The whole system was kept vertical during the duration of the experiment to avoid issues related to cell sedimentation.\n\n\n- Enrichment Procedure: From PBMCs to a CD31+ Enriched Cell Population",
                                "To prepare the bead suspension, 800 \u03bc1 of neutravidin agarose beads (Piercenet, #29204) were diluted in 10 ml of PBS with calcium and magnesium. In order to only keep the larger beads, the suspension was then filtered through a 100 \u03bcm filter (Falcon, #352360). Beads were collected by turning around the filter on a new 50 ml flacon tube and rinsing with 10 ml of PBS. The procedure was repeated twice. The resulting bead solution was divided into two tubes and allowed to settle down for 10 minutes before being resuspended in 600 \u03bcl of PBS. The beads from one tube were transferred to the modified centrifugation tube. After a quick centrifugation step (1 min, 300 g), beads were resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of aptamer solution (5 \u03bcg/ml, Aptamer Sciences Inc.). The tube was incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. After incubation, the tube was centrifuged to remove aptamer solution, and uncoated beads from the second tube were mixed with the aptamer coated beads. Another quick centrifugation was performed and beads were resuspended in 600 \u03bcl binding buffer before closing the tube.",
                                "As illustrated in FIG. 3A, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were run through the system to eliminate CD31\u2212 cells. For the optimization of the system (FIGS. 3B-3E), cryopreserved PBMCs were used and thawed for every experiment. The PBMC cell suspension was run at 50 \u03bcl/min using a concentration of 2.5\u00d7107cells/min in binding buffer, for 10 min. 500 \u03bcl of binding buffer was then run through the system at the same speed before rinsing with PBS at 300 \u03bcl/min to further remove unbound cells. Cells were released by resuspending the beads with a 1 ml syringe using an 18GA needle (VWR, KT868280-1801 (PK). The released cells were then collected in a 2 ml eppendorf tube by an immediate centrifugation at 300 g for 3 min.",
                                "Optimization of the concentration of the aptamer was performed to improve yield without affecting cell viability. As demonstrated in FIG. 3B, the yield of CD31+ cells increased as the concentration of aptamer used to coat the beads increased. A small number of cells remained strongly attached to the beads and required addition of DNAse 1 to release them (FIG. 3B). In general no significant difference was observed between the initial cell viability and that of flow-released cells (FIG. 3C). However, at the highest aptamer concentration, flow-based separation did result in a decrease in cell viability after release, likely due to the overall stronger avidity between the cells and these beads. To determine if adherent cells were retained after intended release, DNAse 1 was applied to digest aptamers after flow release. The use of DNAse 1 significantly affected cell viability at all conditions and increasing aptamer concentration led to an increase of retained cells (FIGS. 4A and 4B). Importantly, the flow based release strategy resulted in an enrichment of CD31+ cells at a lower aptamer concentration but not at the highest aptamer concentrations (FIGS. 4A and 4B). When the concentration of aptamer becomes too high (>10 \u03bcg/ml), more than 10% of the cells remain strongly attach to the beads, and the viability of the cells can be affected when resuspending them. Therefore, subsequent steps for optimization were performed using aptamer concentrations of 5 \u03bcg/ml and 10 \u03bcg/ml, as these provided an appropriate compromise between cell yield, CD31+ purity and cell viability.",
                                "The next set of studies explored the impact of combining uncoated and aptamer coated beads, and varying the total bead number in the columns. A mixture of uncoated beads and aptamer coated beads was employed in the columns, to avoid the potential for clogging the system when all the beads of the system are coated with aptamer. To facilitate release and prevent potential clogging a combination of aptamer coated and uncoated beads was used. Bead number was also optimized. A combination of aptamer coated and uncoated beads in a 1:1 ratio prevented clogging of the system, and no significant difference was observed between the 5 \u03bcg/ml and 10 \u03bcg/ml concentration in that case (FIG. 3D). Therefore, for validation of the system, a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml with a 1:1 ratio of uncoated beads to coated beads was chosen. With the 50:50 mix, clogging was no longer observed, avoiding issues related to pressure building-up in the system. The incorporation of uncoated beads also facilitated resuspension of the beads during the cell recovery.",
                                "The final parameter optimized was the bead volume. An increasing cell yield was initially obtained as the bead number was increased, until a saturation behavior was observed at 400 \u03bcl of bead volume and above (FIG. 3E). The highest yield was achieved when 800 \u03bcl of beads (400 \u03bcl aptamer coated beads and 400 \u03bcl uncoated beads) were added during the enrichment procedure. Importantly, microscopy-based observation of the cell population enriched with this system revealed that none of the isolated cells contained bound beads.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood samples using density centrifugation in Septmate tubes (Stem Cell technologies, 15460). Tubes of this type facilitate performing the procedure in a short amount of time (20 to 30 min), compared to an hour or more with traditional density centrifugation, and eliminates the need for slow density gradient layering. Briefly, whole blood samples were diluted in PBS+2% FCS. Density gradient medium was added to Sepmate tubes before adding diluted blood samples and centrifuging for 10 min at 1200 g at room temperature with brake. The top layer containing the enriched mononuclear cells was poured off and washed twice with PBS+2% FCS and centrifuging at 120 g for 8 min to remove platelets.

To determine whether the enriched CD31+ cells obtained using the optimal column conditions set forth in Example 2 maintain these key functions, both osteogenic and angiogenic in vitro assays were performed. The angiogenic potential of the cells was assessed using a tube formation assay. 40 \u03bcl of Matrigel growth factor reduced (VWR, 354230) was used to coat the wells of a 96 well plate. The coated plate was transferred to a 37\u00b0 C. cell culture incubator for 30 min to allow the gel to solidify. In the meantime, a single cell suspension of 2\u00d7105 cells/ml in culture medium without angiogenesis activators and inhibitors was prepared. 50 \u03bcl of the prepared cell suspension was added to each well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 20 minutes before adding 150 \u03bcl of incubation medium. The plate was then incubated overnight. Cell networking structures were examined under a microscope and pictures were taken at 10\u00d7 using image J. Total length of the network per picture was evaluated and divided by the results obtained for conditioned medium obtained form the patient's initial PBMCs to obtain the relative tube length. For negative control EBM (Lonza, CC3121) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% P/S was used. For a positive control, the EGM bullet kit was used (Lonza, CC3124). The total length of capillary-like tubes showed a 1.9\u00b10.2 increase when normalized to control PBMCs (FIGS. 6A and 6B).",

Mesenchymal stromal cells were purchased from the company ATCC (ATCC-PCS-500-012). Cells from passage 3-4 were utilized for the experiments. In brief, 2.4\u00d7104 cells per well were seeded in a 96 well-plate and cultivated in expansion medium for 24 hours before induction. Osteogenic differentiation medium was purchased commercially (LifeTechnologies, A10072-01) and diluted 1:1 with sterile filtered conditioned media and 100 \u03bcl medium were applied to each well with a medium exchange twice a week. Conditioned medium was derived from purified PBMCs, CD31+ and CD31\u2212 that were cultivated in DMEM low Glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrome), 1% Glutamax (LifeTechnologies) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrome). 1.2\u00d7106 cells were kept in 6 ml of medium over 24 hours. The medium was then sterile filtered and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further experiments. At the end of the differentiation procedure the cell number was determined using a redox-based metabolic assay (AlamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent, LifeTechnologies), before the osteogenic differentiation was visualized via Alizarin Red S staining (ARS). Mineralized matrix positively stained for ARS was rinsed repeatedly with H2O before matrix-bound ARS was dissolved by addition of 10% cetylpyridinium chloride and colorimetrically detected at 562 nm. The resulting values were normalized to the metabolic rate and related to the control cell group that was cultured in regular osteogenic differentiation medium. Calcification was increased by 1.8\u00b10.3 compared to control MSCs (FIGS. 6C and 6D).

                                "In current commercial approaches, cell release from beads coupled to an antibody utilizes an elution buffer, and antibodies remain attached to the cells. Aptamer-based strategies reported to date typically require exposure to the aptamer complementary strand, enzymatic treatment (Shen et al., Advanced materials. 2013;25: 2368-2373), or use of a high concentration dextran sulfate (Yoon et al., PLoS ONE. 2015;10: e0131785-19). Chemical-free approaches to aptamer binding have been reported in which the temperature and shear sensitivity of aptamer binding has been exploited in microfluidic devices (Zhu et al., Lab Chip. 2012; 12(18): 3504-351; Lin et al., IET Nanobiotechnology. ieee; 2014;8).",
                                "This is the first report of reversible aptamer binding without the use of any chemical or temperature modification. Shear stresses induced by resuspending the beads can be sufficient to induce cell release. Additionally, by resuspending the beads and separating them, there is a loss of the avidity effect coming from multiple beads in contact with the cells and the affinity of individual aptamer might be too weak to hold the cells for long. As some cells still remained attached to the beads after shearing, as evidenced by their recovery with a subsequent DNAse step, higher shear stresses could potentially release a greater number of CD31+ cells from the agarose beads. However, increased shear could also lead to cell damage and loss of cell viability. The aptamer affinity was reported to be significantly lower (Kd=1.14\u00d710\u22129M) than the extremely high affinity biotin-neutravidin linkage (Kd=10\u221214 M). Therefore, bead-free cells were also aptamer-free.",
                                "Importantly, the released cell population described herein is free of beads, likely due to the size difference between the beads and the mesh size of the filter component. Neutravidin agarose beads, with a diameter initially between 45 and 165 \u03bcm, were filtered through a 100 \u03bcm cell strainer to select only larger size beads. Concerns from regulatory offices often relate to the possibility of remaining beads in the final product, since most of the cell sorting options currently available rely on beads in the nanometer to micrometer range. However, the filters at the base of the tubes exemplified herein had a 20 \u03bcm mesh size that prevented bead passage, but was still adequate for leukocytes, since their diameter is between 6 and 10 \u03bcm (Schmid-Sch\u00f6nbein et al., Blood. 1980;56: 866-875; Downey et al., J Appl Physiol. 1990;69: 1767-1778). The possibility of phagocytosis of immunobeads during positive cell isolation is also a major concern (Burkardt 0, et al., Annals of anatomy. 2015; 184(1):55-60), but is not an issue in embodiments set forth herein in which the beads used are several times larger than the cells creating a clear size separation between cell and capturing beads.",
                                "Use of an embodiment of the devices exemplified herein produced an enriched CD31+ cell population with increased angiogenic and osteogenic potential. A particular enrichment in monocytes was noted since they had the highest level of CD31 expression among PBMCs. The conditioned medium from the cell population enriched with this system led to an increase in the total tube network length in an angiogenesis assay, and enhanced the osteodifferentiation of MSCs. However, angiogenic and osteogenic promotion are not exclusive to monocytes among CD31+ cells, and the enrichment of na\u00efve T cells may also underlie these effects. Indeed, upon stimulation, CD31+ T cells had an increased secretion of angiogenic factors compared to CD31\u2212 T and those cytokines are highly involved in vessel development and damage response to tissue ischemia (Kushner et al, Blood cells, molecules & diseases; 2009;44: 74-78).",
                                "The devices described herein have significant therapeutic potential. It is commonly accepted that 106 PBMCs/ml can be isolated from blood (Nilsson et al., Clinical and Vaccine Immunology. 2008;15: 585-589). This would imply that with the current approach, approximately 15.8 million enriched CD31+ cells could be collected from 100 ml of blood, which is a reasonable blood draw. The devices of the present invention can also be utilized to target other surface antigens for enrichment. Methods to generate an aptamer to any target of interest have been previously reported (see, e.g., Guo et al, Int J Mol Sci. 2008; 9(4): 668-678), and allow for the in vitro evolution of nucleic acid molecules with highly specific binding to target molecules."
