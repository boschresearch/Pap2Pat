    "title": "Biophysical induction of cell release for minimally manipulative cell enrichment strategies",
    "date": "2017-06-30",
    "abstract": "The use of autologous cells harvested and subsequently transplanted in an intraoperative environment constitutes a new approach to promote regeneration. Usually cells are isolated by selection methods such as fluorescence- or magnetic- activated cell sorting with residual binding of the antibodies or beads. Thus, cell-based therapies would benefit from the development of new devices for cell isolation that minimally manipulate the target cell population. In the clinic, 5 to 10 percent of fractures do not heal properly and CD31+ cells have been identified as promising candidates to support bone regeneration. The aim of this project was to develop and prototype a simple system to facilitate the enrichment of CD31+ cells from whole blood. After validating the specificity of a commercially available aptamer for CD31, we combined this aptamer with traditional magnetic bead strategies, which led to enrichment of CD31+ cells with a purity of 91\u00b110%. Subsequently, the aptamer was attached to agarose beads (\u00d8 = 100\u2013165 um) that were incorporated into a column-based system to enable capture and subsequent release of the CD31+ enriched cells. Different parameters were investigated to allow a biophysical-based cell release from beads, and a simple mixing was found sufficient to release initially bound cells from the optimized column without the need for any chemicals that promote disassociation. The system led to a significant enrichment of CD31+ cells (initial population: 63\u00b19%, released: 87\u00b13%) with excellent cell viability (released: 97\u00b11%). The composition of the released CD31+ fraction indicated an enrichment of the monocyte population. The angiogenic and osteogenic potential of the released cell population were confirmed in vitro. These results and the simplicity of this system highlight the potential of such approach to enable cell enrichment strategies in intraoperative settings.",

                "In order for cell therapies to be translated from the bench to the clinic, they must follow good manufacturing practice guidelines and be approved by regulatory agencies. In the case of exogenous cell therapies, significant regulatory constraints on cell isolation and in vitro expansion procedures to ensure the quality and safety of the resultant product lead to high costs [1,2]. An alternative approach to obtain a sufficient number of cells is cytokine-based cell mobilization, such as the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells [3]. However, not only does this approach necessitate several visits to the hospital for the initial injections or to collect the cells, but is also associated with a wide variety of side-effects ranging from flulike symptoms to more severe conditions [4]. In contrast, intraoperative cell therapies, in which cells are harvested from the patient prior or during the initial operation and then re-administered during the same surgical session, represent a new class of exciting approaches that hold promise to overcome the high costs and many of the potential drawbacks associated with ex vivo cell expansion, cytokine-based cell mobilization, and save time for both patients and clinicians (Fig 1). Bone healing may be an ideal candidate to illustrate such a concept: in the US, approximately 7.9 million bone fractures are reported each year with 5 to 10% resulting in an impaired bone-healing situation [5,6]. Predicting patients at risk and initially providing them with additional treatment may significantly reduce the number of non-union cases and decrease the associated costs [7] and hospital stay [8].",
                "For certain patients, harvesting autologous cells using an intraoperative setup, and enriching or depleting to obtain the appropriate cell population before delivery to the fracture location may improve regeneration. Clinical approaches using CD34+ cells in critical limb ischemia and in non-union treatment are already in place [9,10]. An intraoperative approach to cell therapy was also reported for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, using CD133+ cells derived from iliac crest aspirate [11], and in the context of bone regeneration using marrow-derived connective tissue progenitors [12]. In both cases, positive cell isolation used magnetic beads for cell separation, and these beads remained attached to the cells that were transplanted. In both Europe and the USA, modification of transplanted cells, which includes the use of antibodies or antibody-labeled beads that are not removed, may constitute more than a minimal manipulation and would subsequently be classified as an advanced-therapy medicinal product (ATMP), resulting in substantially greater regulatory burden for the process. It is therefore of interest to develop new isolation procedures, for both positive and negative cell isolation that would be minimally manipulative to be potentially excluded from the ATMP regulation. This would represent a platform technology for various intra-operative approaches.",
                "The aim of this project was to develop and prototype an approach to perform cell enrichment using biophysically induced reversible cell binding. Whole blood was examined as the cell source, since no additional invasive procedure would be necessary for the patient and it could be done in parallel with a surgery. The initial target for this work is CD31, also known as Platelet/Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (PECAM-1), cells, which have angiogenic, osteogenic and immunosuppressive properties [13]. These cells have been used successfully in vivo for treating ischemic vascular disease [14\u201316]. These cells are widely available, as 70 to 78% of viable lymphocytes and monocytes express CD31 and their properties appear to be independent of gender, and preserved with aging [13]. To achieve a positive selection approach that yields a virtually \"untouched\" cell population (bead free, ligand free), we exploited reversible binding of cells to aptamers. Aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind a target with a high specificity and yet, typically, a lower affinity than antibodies [17,18], and have minimal toxicity [19]. They potentially offer competitive advantages over antibodies and other protein biologics, as they are stable under long-term storage at room temperature, can be easily chemically synthesized in a reproducible manner, and can be chemically manipulated with relative ease. Aptamers have already been used in the clinic as therapeutics, and the first approved by the FDA was an RNA aptamer directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- 165 for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration in 2004 [20]. This approval paved the way for future approvals. In the current work, we validated a commercially available aptamer as a promising candidate. We subsequently used it for reversible binding of CD31+ cells, and report the development and optimization of a practical device and procedure for the enrichment of CD31+ cells."

Remaining beads in the filter were then collected. The beads solution was allowed to settle before being resuspended in PBS. After a quick centrifugation step (1 min, 300 g), beads were resuspended in a solution of biotinylated aptamers and incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C.

The CD31+ cells adhered to the aptamer coated beads while CD31- flowed through and were discarded. CD31+ cells were then released from beads by imposing fluid shear with a simple mixing of the beads with attached cells and additional medium. Cells released were then collected by centrifugation (Fig 3a).",
                        "First we optimized the aptamer concentration for the coating of the beads. Increasing the aptamer concentration resulted in an overall increase in the capture of cells (yield), as measured using a biophysically induced (flow release) and a subsequent DNAse based release (Fig 3b). In general no significant difference was observed between the initial cell viability and that of flow-released cells (Fig 3c). However, at the highest aptamer concentration, flow-based separation did result in a decrease in cell viability after release, likely due to the overall stronger avidity between the cells and these beads. To determine if adherent cells were retained after intended release, we applied DNAse 1 to digest aptamers after flow release. The use of DNAse 1 significantly affected cell viability at all conditions and increasing aptamer concentration led to an increase of retained cells (S1 Fig). Importantly, the flow based release strategy resulted in an enrichment of CD31+ cells at a lower aptamer concentration but not at the highest aptamer concentrations (S1 Fig). Therefore, subsequent steps for optimization were focusing on aptamer concentrations of 5 ug/ml and 10 ug/ml, as these provided an appropriate compromise between cell yield, CD31+ purity and cell viability.",

We employed a mixture of uncoated beads and aptamer coated beads in the columns in the first studies, as the system sometimes clogged in the earlier studies and we hypothesized this was due to cells binding throughout the device. An equivalent yield to columns containing all coated beads was found with a 50:50 mix of coated:uncoated beads at the aptamer concentration of 5 ug/ml, but the yield was significantly reduced at an aptamer concentration of 10ug/ml for the combination of uncoated and coated beads (Fig 3d). However, there was no statistical difference using a 50:50 mix between 5 and 10ug/ml. Therefore, we use a 5ug/ml concentration for system validation. With the 50:50 mix, clogging was no longer observed, avoiding issues related to pressure building-up in the system. The incorporation of uncoated beads also facilitated resuspension of the beads during the cell recovery, although this effect was not quantified.",

Flow cytometry data showed mainly double positive (CD31+ and Apt+) and double negative populations (CD31- and Apt-) for cells isolated using aptamer concentrations of 2ug/ml and above. Also, magnetic isolation bead separation resulted in similar enrichment for aptamer and antibody based isolation. This is in agreement with recently published data using the same aptamer to target another cell type expressing CD31; endothelial progenitor cells were successfully isolated from a mixture with CD31- 293FT cells at a comparable level to antibody isolation [21]. In this work, we validated the aptamer for the first time for PBMCs.",
                "Cell release from this enrichment system was mediated solely by mechanical forces and did not require the use of any additional chemicals that could contaminate the isolated cells. A compromise between cell yield, CD31+ purity, and cell viability was found by adjusting aptamer concentration, bead number and combining uncoated and aptamer coated beads. In current commercial approaches, cell release from beads in antibody approaches utilizes an elution buffer, and antibodies remain attached to the cells. Whereas aptamers offer the possibility of a reversible binding approach, strategies reported to date typically require exposure to the aptamer complementary strand, enzymatic treatment [22], or use of a high concentration dextran sulfate [20]. Chemical-free approaches to aptamer binding have been reported in which the temperature and shear sensitivity of aptamer binding has been exploited in microfluidic devices [23,24]. However, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first report of reversible aptamer binding without the use of any chemical or temperature modification. As biological bonds based on secondary interactions can be sensitive to applied stress [25\u201328], it is not surprising that shear stresses induced by resuspending the beads can be sufficient to induce cell release. Additionally, by resuspending the beads and separating them, there is a loss of the avidity effect coming from multiple beads in contact with the cells and the affinity of individual aptamer might be too weak to hold the cells for long. As some cells still remained attached to the beads after shearing, as evidenced by their recovery with a subsequent DNAse step, higher shear stresses could potentially release a greater number of CD31+ cells from the agarose beads. However, increased shear could also lead to cell damage and loss of cell viability. The aptamer affinity was reported to be significantly lower (Kd = 1.14x10^-9M) than the extremely high affinity biotin-neutravidin linkage (Kd = 10^-14 M). Therefore, it is also reasonable to assume that bead-free cells were also aptamer-free. This was confirmed using a bi-labeled version of the biotinylated aptamer with additional fluorochrome Cy5 (S4 Fig). This approach gave the possibility to analyze the cells once collected after enrichment, without having to do any additional labeling step that might result in aptamers falling off or unspecific binding of the secondary antibody. Also, according to the manufacturer, there was no biophysical differences between the mono- and the bi-labeled aptamer.",
                "Importantly, the released cell population with the system developed in this report is free of beads, likely due to the size difference between the beads and the mesh size of the filter component. Neutravidin agarose beads, with a diameter initially between 45 and 165 um, were filtered through a 100 um cell strainer to select only larger size beads. Concerns from regulatory offices often relate to the possibility of remaining beads in the final product, since most of the cell sorting options currently available rely on beads in the nanometer to micrometer range. However, the filters at the base of the tubes in the current system have a 20 um mesh size that prevent bead passage, but was still adequate for leukocytes, since their diameter is between 6 and 10um [29,30]. The possibility of phagocytosis of immunobeads during positive cell isolation is also a major concern [31], but is not an issue in our approach due to the fact that the beads used here are several times larger than the cells creating a clear size separation between cell and capturing beads as was also reported for other systems before [32].",
                "The system leads to an enriched CD31+ cell population with increased angiogenic and osteogenic potential. A particular enrichment in monocytes was noted, which is not surprising since we observed that they had the highest level of CD31 expression among PBMCs. However, an increase in naive T cells also took place. In a previous study, a similar concept of selective enrichment was reported by Sass et al. but using the magnetic activated cell sorting [13]. The conditioned medium from the cell population enriched with this improved system led to an increase in the total tube network length in an angiogenesis assay, and enhanced the osteodifferentiation of MSCs. Those results are in agreement and have been already demonstrated by Sass et al. for CD31+ enriched cell populations and the respective subpopulations [13]. Other studies have also shown that monocytes are involved in promoting bone formation through non-immunological aspects either directly by cytokine secretion of osteogenic and angiogenic factors, or indirectly by activating additional cells to also secret appropriate cytokines [33,34]. However, angiogenic and osteogenic promotion are not exclusive to monocytes among CD31+ cells, and the enrichment of na\u00efve T cells may also underlie these effects. Indeed, upon stimulation, CD31+ T cells had an increased secretion of angiogenic factors (G-CSF, interleukin 8 and matrix metallopeptidase-9) compared to CD31- T and those cytokines are highly involved in vessel development and damage response to tissue ischemia. [35].",
                "This system has significant therapeutic potential. It is commonly accepted that 106 PBMCs/ml can be isolated from blood [36]. This would imply that with the current approach, approximately 15.8 million enriched CD31+ cells could be collected from 100 ml of blood, which is a reasonable blood draw. Further development of this system could also allow it to be utilized to target other surface antigens for either enrichment or depletion. Methods to generate an aptamer to a target of interest have been previously reported [37], and allow for the in vitro evolution of nucleic acid molecules with highly specific binding to target molecules. To utilize this system to deplete undesirable cell populations, one could simply use agarose beads coated with an appropriate antibody or aptamer to remove these cells from a mixed population; in this approach, the desirable cells would be those that initially pass through the system. One target for selective depletion could be CD8+ T cells, as they have been shown to have a negative impact on the bone healing process [38]. Coating the agarose beads with a biotinylated antibody for CD8+ allowed depletion of those cells from a starting PBMCs population (S2 Fig). One could also combine a series of these separations, allowing both positive and negative selections to be integrated into one system."
