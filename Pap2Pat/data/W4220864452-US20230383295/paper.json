    "abstract": "Endothelial cells of blood vessels of the central nervous system (CNS) constitute blood-CNS barriers. Barrier properties are not intrinsic to these cells; rather they are induced and maintained by CNS microenvironment. Notably, the abluminal surfaces of CNS capillaries are ensheathed by pericytes and astrocytes. However, extrinsic factors from these perivascular cells that regulate barrier integrity are largely unknown. Here, we establish vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein secreted by CNS pericytes, as a regulator of blood-CNS barrier function via interactions with its integrin receptor, \u03b15, in endothelial cells. Genetic ablation of vitronectin or mutating vitronectin to prevent integrin binding, as well as endothelial-specific deletion of integrin \u03b15, causes barrier leakage in mice. Furthermore, vitronectin-integrin \u03b15 signaling maintains barrier integrity by actively inhibiting transcytosis in endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that signaling from perivascular cells to endothelial cells via ligand-receptor interactions is a key mechanism to regulate barrier permeability.",

                "The CNS requires an optimal and tightly regulated microenvironment for efficient synaptic transmission. This is achieved by blood-CNS barriers that regulate substance flux to maintain tissue homeostasis. Two such barriers are the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retina barrier (BRB) that are physiologically similar barriers separating the blood from brain and retina, respectively. The restrictive permeability of CNS endothelial cells that constitute these barriers is a result of specialized tight junctions and low rates of transcytosis, which limit substance exchange between blood and the CNS tissue (Andreone et al., 2017; Ben-Zvi et al., 2014; Chow and Gu, 2017; Langen et al., 2019; Reese and Karnovsky, 1967; Zhao et al., 2015).",
                "Barrier properties are not intrinsic to CNS endothelial cells; they require active induction and maintenance from brain parenchyma cells (Armulik et al., 2010; Daneman et al., 2010; Heithoff et al., 2021; Stewart and Wiley, 1981). For example, Wnt ligands released by glia and neurons act on CNS endothelial cells to induce and maintain barrier properties (Daneman et al., 2009; Liebner et al., 2008; Stenman et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012, 2019b). In contrast to glia and neurons, pericytes are directly in contact with capillary endothelial cells. Pericytes ensheathe capillary endothelial cells and share the same basement membrane with them allowing for elaborate cell-cell signaling between these two cells. Intriguingly, the brain and retina have the highest pericyte to endothelial cell ratio compared to that in other tissues (Frank et al., 1987; Shepro and Morel, 1993). Indeed, mice with decreased pericyte coverage around endothelial cells exhibit leaky blood-CNS barriers (Armulik et al., 2010; Bell et al., 2010; Daneman et al., 2010; Park et al., 2017). However, how pericytes signal to endothelial cells to maintain barrier integrity is unknown.",
                "Here, we identify vitronectin, a pericyte-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) protein as an important regulator of barrier integrity. We establish that vitronectin regulates barrier function via binding to its integrin receptors on endothelial cells. Specifically, vitronectin is enriched in CNS pericytes, and mice lacking vitronectin as well as vitronectin mutant mice (VtnRGE) that cannot bind integrin receptors exhibit barrier leakage. Moreover, we found that the RGD-ligand binding integrins, \u03b15 and \u03b1v are expressed in CNS endothelial cells, and endothelial cell-specific acute deletion of \u03b15 but not \u03b1v results in leaky barrier. We further demonstrate that barrier leakage observed in vitronectin mutant mice is due to increased transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells, but not due to deficits in tight junctions; and activation of integrin \u03b15 by vitronectin inhibits endocytosis in CNS endothelial cells. Together, our results indicate that ligand-receptor interactions between pericyte-derived vitronectin and its integrin receptor expressed in CNS endothelial cells are critical for barrier integrity and may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for CNS drug delivery."

                        "In order to identify pericyte candidate genes important for barrier function we took advantage of the retina as a model system. In the retinas of mice, CNS vessels invade the optic nerve head at postnatal day (P1) and expand radially from the center toward the periphery. As vessels grow from the proximal to distal ends of the retina, proximal vessels gain barrier properties and have a functional BRB, while the newly formed distal vessels have a leaky BRB (Chow and Gu, 2017). By examination of an existing transcriptome comparing the proximal and distal retinal vessels that contain a mixture of endothelial cells and pericytes (Strasser et al., 2010) and a brain pericyte transcriptomic database (He et al., 2016), we identified CNS pericyte genes that correlated with functional blood-retinal barrier. Of these candidate pericyte genes, we focused specifically on secreted and trans-membrane proteins as these are likely involved in ligand-receptor interactions. These analyses identified vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein.",
                        "To validate our gene expression analyses, we first examined vitronectin protein localization in the CNS. Consistent with enriched Vtn transcript in proximal compared to distal vessels of the developing retina (Strasser et al., 2010), we also observed vitronectin protein highly expressed in proximal vessels with sealed BRB, and was not detectable in the distal, leaky vessels of the retina at P7 (Figures 1A, S1A). Similarly, vitronectin protein was also detected along capillaries of the brain (Figure 1B). As vitronectin is a secreted protein, to determine the cells producing Vtn, we used in situ hybridization to examine Vtn mRNA in the brain. Vtn mRNA is specifically expressed in Pdgfrb expressing pericytes adjacent to capillary endothelial cells (Figure 1C). At P7, Vtn is expressed in >97% (115 out of 118 cells across 3 mice) of the Pdgfrb+ pericytes abutting capillaries and was present throughout the brain (Figures 1C, S1B). In contrast to high Vtn mRNA in CNS pericytes, we observed little to no expression in pericytes of peripheral tissues, such as the lung (Figures 1D, 1E). Our data are consistent with recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealing abundant Vtn expression in P14 retinal pericytes (Macosko et al., 2015; La Manno et al., 2021; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018). This is also consistent with single cell-RNA sequencing studies in adult brains with Vtn expression in pericytes but little to no expression in non-vascular CNS cells such as neurons and astrocytes (La Manno et al., 2021; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018)."

The injected tracer was completely confined to vessels in control mice, whereas tracer leaked out of vessels in the retinas of Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice. Numerous leaky hotspots of the tracer were apparent in the parenchyma (Figure 2A) and in neuronal cell bodies (Figure 2B) in the retinas of these mice (Figure 2C). This leakage was not limited to just small tracers like Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (0.5 kDa) as we observed similar leakage with higher molecular weight tracers such as 10 kDa Dextran (Figure S2A, S2B). Furthermore, this leakage persisted through adulthood in these mice (Figure S2C). Similar to the retina, we also observed BBB leakage in the cerebellum (Figures 2D, 2E). Thus, these findings demonstrate an important role for vitronectin in blood-CNS barrier function.",
                        "In addition to being an ECM protein, vitronectin is also an abundant protein circulating in the plasma which has been shown to mediate the complement pathway and play a role in tissue repair and wound healing (Leavesley et al., 2013; Preissner and Reuning, 2011). To fully establish that the barrier deficits we observe in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice are indeed due to the lack of pericyte-secreted vitronectin and not due to the lack of circulating vitronectin, we took advantage of the fact that vitronectin in plasma is synthesized and secreted by liver hepatocytes and intravenous injections of siRNAs largely target the liver tissue with little to no distribution to other tissues (Song et al., 2003; Zender et al., 2003). To specifically knockdown the circulating vitronectin, we intravenously injected siRNAs targeting vitronectin or control siRNAs into 6-week old wildtype mice on two consecutive days (Figure 3A) based on previously established studies for efficient liver targeting (Song et al., 2003; Wrobel et al., 2021). Knockdown of vitronectin in plasma was evaluated by ELISA at day 3 or 5, i.e. 24 hours or 72 hours post the last dose of siRNA injections (Figure 3A). ELISA kit was validated by measuring levels of plasma vitronectin in wild-type, Vtn+/\u2212, and Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 3B). We performed these experiments with two independent siRNAs at both the timepoints. We observed as high as 98.56 \u00b1 0.06% knockdown of vitronectin in plasma isolated from mice injected with vitronectin targeting siRNAs (Figures 3C, 3F). Importantly, at both these timepoints, we detected no leakage in mice injected with either siRNA targeting vitronectin or control siRNA (Figures 3D, 3E, 3G, 3H), demonstrating that plasma vitronectin is likely dispensable for barrier function. Thus, the combination of leaky barriers in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice and intact barriers in mice specifically lacking plasma vitronectin demonstrates an important role for pericyte-secreted vitronectin in blood-CNS barrier function."

In both retina and cerebellum of Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice and wildtype littermates, we observed HRP halting at tight junction \u201ckissing points\u201d between endothelial cells of capillaries (Figure 4A, 4B), indicating functional tight junctions. Consistent with this, we observed no changes in Claudin-5 protein expression in the retinas of Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4C). Closer examination of Claudin-5 and ZO-1 revealed that the localization of these proteins to cell-cell junctions is also unaltered (Figure 4D). In contrast, both retinal and cerebellum endothelial cells of Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly increased HRP-filled vesicles (Figures 4E, 4G). Retinal endothelial cells had a 3-fold increase in vesicles compared to wildtype mice (Figure 4F) and cerebellar endothelial cells had 2-fold increase (Figure 4H), revealing that transcytosis is upregulated in these mice. Interestingly, in the cerebellum of these mice, we also observed HRP-filled vesicles in adjacent pericytes (Figure S3A) and about 25% of capillaries had their basement membrane completely filled with HRP (Figures S3B, S3C). This result indicates that tracer-filled vesicles are indeed transcytosed across endothelial cells (red arrowheads in example 2 of Figure S3A). These data reveal that barrier leakage in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to upregulated transcytosis. Together, these observations demonstrate that pericyte-derived vitronectin regulates barrier function by specifically inhibiting transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells."

One possibility is that barrier defects are due to impaired vessel development as pericytes are known to regulate endothelial sprouting and angiogenesis in the postnatal retinal vasculature (Eilken et al., 2017). However, we observed no changes in vascular patterning (Figure 5A). Specifically, we observed no changes in vessel density, capillary branching or radial outgrowth of the vasculature in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wildtype littermates (Figures 5B\u2013D).",

However, using NG2:DsRed mice that label mural cells (Figure 5E), similar pericyte coverage and pericyte density were observed in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype mice (Figures 5F, 5G). PDGFR\u03b2 protein levels were also similar in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype retinas (Figure 5H, 5I). Hence, vitronectin regulates barrier function without altering pericyte density or pericyte coverage.",

EM analysis of retinal and cerebellum capillaries revealed no obvious structural changes in the basement membrane of endothelial cells in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wildtype mice. Moreover, immunostaining and western blotting of two highly enriched ECM proteins, collagen IV and fibronectin reveal normal localization (Figures S4A, S4B) and expression levels (Figure S4D, S4E) of these proteins in retinas of Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice. Notably, we also observed normal collagen IV ensheathment of retinal blood vessels in Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure S4C). Similarly, we observed normal localization and expression of two other ECM proteins, perlecan and laminin \u03b14 in the retina vasculature of Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figures S4F, S4G). Finally, we also used our EM data to investigate astrocyte endfeet attachments and observed no changes in average area of cerebellum capillaries covered by astrocyte endfeet between wildtype and Vtn\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure S4H, S4I). Thus, the overall structural and functional organization of the vascular basement membrane or the ECM was not compromised in mice lacking vitronectin.",

Previous biochemical studies established that competitive binding experiments using short peptides containing the RGD domain (Orlando and Cheresh, 1991) as well as mutating vitronectin RGD to RGE (aspartic acid to glutamic acid) effectively abolished binding of vitronectin to integrins (Cherny et al., 1993). To determine if vitronectin binding to integrins is essential for barrier function, we took advantage of the knock-in mouse line harboring single point mutation of vitronectin with RGD domain mutated to RGE, VtnRGE/RGE (Wheaton et al., 2016), hereafter referred to as VtnRGE.",

While \u03b1v is considered the predominant receptor for vitronectin, cell motility studies have also demonstrated interaction of vitronectin with \u03b15 (Bauer et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1993). Indeed, when primary mouse brain endothelial cells were grown on vitronectin-coated dishes, we readily observed adhesive structures containing endogenous integrin \u03b15 (Figures S5A). In contrast, no adhesion structures were observed in cells grown on collagen IV coated or laminin-511 (\u03b15\u03b21\u03b31, hereafter referred to as laminin) coated dishes, demonstrating specific binding and activation of integrin \u03b15 by vitronectin (Figures S5A, S5B). To mimic and recapitulate the in vivo ECM as much as possible we also grew these cells on a combination of ECM ligands. Similar to our findings with individual ligands, we observed integrin \u03b15 containing adhesion structures only in the presence of vitronectin (Figures 7A, 7B). Furthermore, >95% of \u03b15 adhesions were positive for and co-localized with classic focal adhesion proteins such as phosphorylated FAK (Y397), paxillin, and vinculin (Figures S5C, S5D), indicating that \u03b15 adhesions are indeed bonafide focal adhesion structures. Thus, vitronectin actively engages integrin \u03b15 receptors in CNS endothelial cells and drives the formation of \u03b15 containing focal adhesions.",

Knockdown of integrin \u03b15 in these cells with two independent shRNAs (Figure 7C, 7D), resulted in a significant increase in endocytosis (Figures 7E, 7F). In cells depleted of integrin \u03b15 by either shRNA, FM1-43FX dye was readily incorporated in the newly formed vesicles that were endocytosed from plasma membrane, whereas very few FM1-43FX dye-positive vesicles were observed within the cells transfected with scrambled shRNA.

Disengaging integrin receptors from vitronectin likely causes a reduction in membrane tension and it is well known that decreased membrane tension promotes increased endocytosis (Diz-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2013; Sheetz and Dai, 1996; Thottacherry et al., 2018). Thus, it is plausible that vitronectin binding to integrin \u03b15 exerts adhesive forces to maintain the plasma membrane tension to ensure low rates of transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells. Our results indicate that signals from perivascular cells to endothelial cells via designated ligand-receptor pairs contribute to the unique biophysical properties of CNS endothelial membrane for barrier integrity.",
                "Our work demonstrates the importance of signaling between perivascular cells and CNS endothelial cells in modulating blood-CNS barriers. It is likely that in addition to vitronectin, other ECM molecules also play key roles in barrier function given that ECM is a hub for ligand-receptor interactions across multiple cell types. Indeed, there is evidence for fibronectin interacting with \u03b15 receptor impacting brain endothelial cell survival (Wang and Milner, 2006) and promoting blood-brain barrier integrity following stroke (Wang et al., 2019a). Absence of integrin receptors also triggers onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Kant et al., 2019). Not surprisingly, ECM breakdown is a hallmark feature associated with many diseases and disorders of the CNS (Thomsen et al., 2017). Thus, our findings reveal new molecular targets and pathways within the CNS for development of novel therapeutics that could aid CNS drug delivery."
