    "abstract": "Recombinant soluble, cleaved HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers based on the subtype A BG505 sequence are being studied structurally and tested as immunogens in animals. For these trimers to become a vaccine candidate for human trials, they would need to be made in appropriate amounts at an acceptable quality. Accomplishing such tasks by transient transfection is likely to be challenging. The traditional way to express recombinant proteins in large amounts is via a permanent cell line, usually of mammalian origin. Making cell lines that produce BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers requires the co-expression of the Furin protease to ensure that the cleavage site between the gp120 and gp41 subunits is fully utilized. We designed a vector capable of expressing Env and Furin, and used it to create Stable 293 T and CHO Flp-In\u2122 cell lines through site-specific recombination. Both lines produce high quality, cleaved trimers at yields of up to 12\u201315 mg per 1 \u00d7 109 cells. Trimer expression at such levels was maintained for up to 30 days (10 passages) after initial seeding and was consistently superior to what could be achieved by transient transfection. Electron microscopy studies confirm that the purified trimers have the same native-like appearance as those derived by transient transfection and used to generate high-resolution structures. They also have appropriate antigenic properties, including the presentation of the quaternary epitope for the broadly neutralizing antibody PGT145. The BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer-expressing cell lines yield proteins of an appropriate quality for structural studies and animal immunogenicity experiments. The methodology is suitable for making similar lines under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions, to produce trimers for human clinical trials. Moreover, any env gene can be incorporated into this vector system, allowing the manufacture of SOSIP trimers from multiple genotypes, either by transient transfection or from stable cell lines.",

                "The development of a vaccine against HIV-1 infection remains a significant global health problem. One of the major vaccine design concepts is the induction of high titer broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that are capable of preventing HIV-1 entry into its target cells, and hence intervening against virus transmission [1]. The only relevant target for bNAbs is the Env complex, or spike, on the virus surface [2,3]. This complex, a trimer of gp120/gp41 heterodimers, attaches to receptors on target cells and then mediates fusion of the viral and cell membranes [4]. Any antibodies that can bind to a sufficient number of functional Env spikes will impede one or more stages in the receptor-binding and fusion process, thereby neutralizing infectivity [2].",
                "The induction of bNAbs by vaccination remains elusive. Among relevant strategies is the creation of structural and antigenic mimics of the native, virion-associated Env spike. To do so involves inserting a stop codon to truncate the gp140 prior to the membrane-spanning domain, thereby yielding soluble proteins that can be secreted from producer cells and purified. Unfortunately, without suitable sequence modifications, soluble gp140s are highly unstable and either disintegrate completely into their constituents or adopt non-native configurations that may be compromised from the perspective of bNAb induction [5,6]. One effective strategy for making soluble, native-like trimers involves introducing a disulfide bond (designated SOS) to link the gp120 and gp41 ectodomain (gp41ECTO) components, combined with a point substitution (I559P) in gp41ECTO that creates additional stability [7-9]. Proteolytic cleavage between the gp120 and gp41 subunits is also critical for making native-like trimers, and is facilitated by optimizing the cleavage site and co-expressing the Furin protease [8,9]. At present, the most advanced soluble, cleaved trimers, based on a subtype A founder virus, are designated BG505 SOSIP.664 [10-12]. These highly homogeneous trimers closely resemble virus spikes when visualized by negative stain electron microscopy (EM) [10]. They also have highly favorable antigenic properties, expressing multiple bNAb epitopes while occluding most epitopes for non-neutralizing antibodies (non-NAbs) [6,10]. In addition, the structure of these trimers has been determined by both x-ray diffraction and cryo-EM at ~5-6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution [13,14]. Animal immunogenicity studies are in progress.",
                "To facilitate the production of BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers as pre-clinical research reagents, and to establish a proof-of-concept for their future manufacture as clinical-grade immunogens, we have assessed whether they can be expressed in permanent cell lines. A complexity in the cell line design strategy was the need to co-express Furin, to ensure the trimers are fully cleaved. Another important requirement for a stable mammalian cell line is a defined integration site(s). The Flp-In\u2122 system seemed an appropriate choice; it has, for example, been used to produce influenza hemagglutinin-based vaccines [15]. Here, we show that the Flp-In\u2122 method can be used to make both 293\u00a0T and CHO cell lines that yield substantial amounts (up to 12\u201315\u00a0mg from 1 \u00d7 109 cells) of high quality trimers. The purified trimers are fully cleaved, have appropriate antigenic properties and, when viewed by negative stain EM, appear identical to ones produced by transient transfection [6,10]. The method used to make the lines is speedy and flexible, which will facilitate the future production of additional SOSIP trimers of improved designs and/or different genotypes. It should also be adaptable to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions appropriate for making immunogens for human vaccine trials."

The choice of elements to use in the pAM/C BG505 vector was determined by assessing the priority of expression. Thus, we elected to use the highest activity (CMV) promoter for Env expression (to maximize trimer production), but a lower activity promoter (EFI Alpha) for Furin (to reduce the risk of cytotoxicity). When choosing the promoters and polyadenylation sites, we also considered the elements already present within the pcDNA5/FRT vector. For example, we could not use the SV40 promoter and Poly A for expressing Env or Furin because these elements are already active in the vector. Overall, we decided that the most efficient additions to the pcDNA5/FRT vector would be the EF1 Alpha promoter and a synthetic Poly A from New England BioLabs (modeled from the HSV Thymidine Kinase Poly A), between the HindIII and NotI cloning sites (Figure\u00a01A).",

The complete BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 sequence was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT between the HindIII and NotI sites, under the control of the CMV promoter to promote high-level constitutive Env expression (Figure\u00a01A). Since complete cleavage of Env at the gp120-gp41ECTO juncture is essential for the production of native-like trimers [5,6,9,17] we also inserted the furin gene, in this case under the control of the weaker EFI Alpha promoter. The resulting plasmid that contains both the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 and Furin sequences is designated pAM/C BG505 (Figure\u00a01A)."

Using the Flp-In\u2122 system, we obtained four potentially stable preliminary cell lines, 293 T lines 13 and 15 and CHO lines A and B. To eliminate the possibility that these initial lines were non-isogenic (i.e., genetically mixed), we next performed limiting dilution on the 293 T Flp-In\u2122 line 13 and the CHO lines A and B, as these three consistently expressed the highest Env levels judged by dot blot using MAb 2G12. Limiting dilution resulted in 32 potential 293 T cell clones and 10 potential CHO cell clones. We used FITC-labeled MAb 2G12 (FITC-2G12) and FACS to assess Env expression and clonality; this procedure identified 293 T clone 13 #3-5 and CHO clone B-D7 as the highest-expressing clones for further propagation (Figure\u00a01B and data not shown). An ELISA based on 2G12 capture of Env proteins followed by detection of trimers with biotinylated MAb PGT145 (bio-PGT145) confirmed that culture supernatants from these clones contained the highest quantities of trimers: 2.1 \u03bcg/ml for 293 T clone 13 #3-5 and 1.7 \u03bcg/ml for CHO clone B-D7 (Figure\u00a01C). Staining with FITC-2G12 in the presence of Brefeldin A showed that Env proteins accumulated within the cell for both these clones, but were absent from the parental controls (Figure\u00a01D)."

Cell viability (parental vs. stable cell lines) was 91-98% vs. 91-96% for 293\u00a0T, and 86-95% vs. 87-94% for CHO, throughout the culture period, implying that neither Env nor Furin was cytotoxic to these lines (Figure\u00a02C). Overall, the two stable cell lines could be passaged for 5\u00a0weeks without any observable reduction in Env expression or cell viability. The BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers can, therefore, be produced by the same batch of cells for at least this period after initial seeding, and probably far longer."

In all cases, the trimers were purified by 2G12-affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) [6,10]. A Coomassie blue-stained native (BN-PAGE) gel showed that the 2G12-enriched Env proteins were mostly trimeric, with only modest amounts of dimers and/or monomers visible (Figure\u00a03A). The trimer fractions were then purified by SEC. Gel-electrophoretic analyses under native conditions (BN-PAGE, followed by Coomassie blue staining) showed that the purities of the different trimer preparations (cell lines vs. transient transfection) were indistinguishable (Figure\u00a03B).

For the stable CHO cell line vs. transiently transfected CHO cells, the corresponding values were 12\u00a0mg (range 10\u201315\u00a0mg) and 0.375\u00a0mg (range 0.25-0.5\u00a0mg), a ~32-fold differential.",

Note that the gp41ECTO fragments stain poorly and are not always visible.",

The detection MAb, ARP 3119, binds to a well-conserved, linear epitope within the N-terminal half of gp120. In other studies, we confirmed that it recognizes the 70-kDa (but not the 50-kDa) fragment that is produced when monomeric MN gp120 is clipped by proteases within the V3 region (data not shown). When the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer blots were probed with ARP 3119, only a 120-kDa band (i.e., gp120) was detected, with no degradation products visible (Figure\u00a03D). To seek any Env fragments that might escape detection by ARP 3119, we performed a similar reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis but probed the blots with polyclonal HIV-Ig (Figures\u00a03E and F). As positive controls, we included two other types of Env protein that are known to be vulnerable to proteolytic degradation, i.e., a monomeric gp120 and an uncleaved gp140 that contains three gp120 and three gp41ECTO subunits [5,6,18,19]. The BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers are from subtype A, the gp120 protein, MN, is from subtype B, and the uncleaved gp140, CZA97.012, from subtype C [20]. Accordingly, we used a HIV-Ig pool based on sera from different individuals infected with viruses from all three subtypes. The comparator gp120 and gp140 proteins were SEC-purified and each migrated as a single band of appropriate size when analyzed by BN-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (data not shown).",

In contrast, multiple degradation products were clearly visible in the SEC-purified monomeric gp120 and uncleaved gp140 preparations. The dominant bands from the gp120 monomers were the characteristic 70\u00a0kDa and 50\u00a0kDa fragments arising from V3 clipping. However, additional, unknown fragments of the uncleaved gp140 were also present, as well as high m.wt. bands corresponding to proteins that spontaneously aggregate after SEC-purification (Figure\u00a03E). These observations were reinforced by Western blots, which confirmed that the various additional gp120- or gp140-derived bands were Env proteins. Again, however, there were no signs of degradation or aggregation with the various cell sources of BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers (Figure\u00a03F)."

Immobilized bNAb PGT145, to a quaternary structure-dependent (i.e., trimer-specific) epitope, bound strongly while, in contrast, the non-NAb F105 against a CD4bs epitope reacted only minimally (Figure\u00a04A). The F105 epitope is occluded on native trimers [10,21]. We have reported elsewhere that this MAb binds efficiently to BG505 gp120 monomers, and also to uncleaved (i.e., non-native) BG505 gp140 proteins [6,10]. Accordingly, the lack of F105 reactivity with the purified BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers is consistent with the absence of contaminant gp120 monomers of other non-native forms of Env such as uncleaved gp140 proteins. Of note is that the binding profiles obtained for the two MAbs were independent of the cell source of the trimers (Figure\u00a04A).",

As with the SPR system, an appropriate measure of structural authenticity for the trimers is strong PGT145 reactivity combined with low binding of F105. Again, irrespective of the trimer source, we found that PGT145 bound efficiently in the 2G12-capture ELISA whereas F105 was completely non-reactive (Figure\u00a04B)."

The percentages of native-like trimers varied in the range 81-100%, and were usually somewhat higher for 293\u00a0T cell-derived trimers (90-100%) than CHO (80-90%). However, we consider that native-like trimer percentages in this range (80-100%) are within experimental error for this method. Accordingly, we conclude that trimers from both the 293\u00a0T and CHO stable lines adopt a single native-like configuration that is indistinguishable, at this level of resolution, from the transient transfection products used to derive high-resolution cryo-EM and X-ray structures [13,14].",

The cell lines, of course, produce trimers continuously. Accordingly, we estimate that, under standard laboratory conditions, we can generate 20\u201340\u00a0mg of trimers from 10 fully confluent seeded hyperflasks, by re-feeding media and harvesting ~12-24 liters of supernatant over a 2\u20133\u00a0week period.",
                "The purified BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers appear indistinguishable from ones produced by transient transfection of the same cell types, as judged by biochemical, antigenicity, EM and DSC analyses [10,22,23]. The cell line-derived trimers were fully cleaved, as determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing vs. non-reducing conditions (Figure\u00a03C). The negative stain EM images and the antigenicity profiles are also completely consistent with efficient trimer cleavage, as uncleaved gp140 proteins have different antigenicity properties (i.e., F105-reactive, PGT145-nonreactive) and a distinctive, non-native appearance when viewed by EM [6]. The 293\u00a0T and CHO cell-derived trimers should therefore be suitable for both structural and immunogenicity studies. They may differ in the fine details of their glycosylation, given that the cells are of human and hamster origin, respectively. We have not, however, yet found any antigenic differences between 293\u00a0T- and CHO-cell derived trimers (with or without ELISA-enabling epitope tags), including with multiple bNAbs to glycan-dependent epitopes (Figure\u00a04, and data not shown). Hence both cell lines are likely to be useful resources for trimer production. Of note is that BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers produced by transient transfection of 293\u00a0T and 293S cells were the reagents used to generate cryo-EM and x-ray structures, respectively, at ~5-6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution [13,14]. We are now making good progress towards a permanent cell line based on 293S cells, for additional x-ray diffraction studies.",
                "We saw no indications that the cell line-derived BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers are degraded by proteases, including but not limited to ones that clip the V3 region to yield characteristic 70\u00a0kDa and 50\u00a0kDa fragments on reducing SDS-PAGE gels and Western blots (Figure\u00a03D-F) [18,19]. In contrast, a monomeric gp120 (MN) and an uncleaved gp140 (CZA97.012) were highly vulnerable to proteolytic degradation, including but in the latter case not limited to V3 clipping. The uncleaved gp140 also formed aggregates even after the fraction corresponding to three gp120 and three gp41ECTO subunits was first SEC-purified (Figure\u00a03E and F). The resistance of the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers to proteolytic degradation is at least partly because the BG505 V3 sequence is not particularly vulnerable to clipping, compared to other Env genotypes; we have, for example, seen no signs of V3 clipping when making monomeric BG505 gp120 proteins by transient transfection when, under the same conditions, MN gp120 is badly degraded (data not shown). However, there are also structural considerations; the SOSIP.664 trimers are compact entities in which potentially vulnerable scissile sites, particularly V3, are inaccessible to proteases [13,14]. We have also not observed V3 clipping or other signs of gp120 degradation with other SOSIP.664 trimers, including ones based on subtype B sequences (AC, JK and JPM, unpublished results). In contrast, V3 and other protease-sensitive regions are more exposed on both gp120 monomers and uncleaved gp140s. The latter invariably adopt splayed out, non-native shapes with three individual gp120 subunits dangling freely from a central gp41ECTO 6-helix-bundle, conformations in which various sites, including V3, are exposed to protease attack [5,6]. In addition, uncleaved gp140 proteins form aggregates post-purification, which probably arises from the inappropriate exposure of hydrophobic sites within gp41ECTO. The native-like SOSIP.664 trimers do not form such aggregates.",
                "The present cell lines were not made under GMP-conditions, but their creation serves as a proof of concept for the manufacture of GMP-compliant lines that could serve as the sources of BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimers for human testing as vaccine antigens. CHO cell lines are commonly employed to make clinical grade recombinant proteins, and the use of 293 cell-based lines may also be feasible. We have recently re-designed the present pAM/C BG505 vector to facilitate the insertion of other env genes and thereby increase its flexibility as a device to produce SOSIP trimers based on a range of sequences. This vector system is also useful for making Furin-cleaved SOSIP trimers by transient transfection. We are presently assessing, in rabbits, its utility as a DNA vaccine vector for expressing cleaved SOSIP trimers in vivo."

The gene was cloned into an expression plasmid containing a Flp Recombination Target (FRT) site linked to the hygromycin resistance gene, to permit Flp recombinase-mediated integration and facilitate the selection of a stable cell line expressing gp140 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early enhancer/promoter (Figure\u00a01A). The furin protease gene was inserted into the same expression vector under the control of the EFI Alpha promoter. The resulting vector expressing both the gp140 and Furin proteins was termed pAM/C BG505. Large-scale plasmid preparations were prepared by transformation of DH5\u03b1-competent cells using a Qiagen\u2122 EndoFree MaxiPrep kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions."
