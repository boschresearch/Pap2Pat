                        "Devices using electromagnetic waves having a frequency in the terahertz domain (e.g. from 1 to 100 THz) have important applications, for example in spectroscopy, medicine, security and imaging. These devices include terahertz detectors/transducers operating in the terahertz domain which rely on the conversion of the radiation energy of an incident electromagnetic wave into a measurable form.",
                        "For example, in thermal terahertz detectors/transducers, the energy of the incident electromagnetic wave is absorbed and converted into heat. The efficient thermal detection of terahertz electromagnetic waves has technologically developed around two main concepts: bolometers and Golay cells.",
                        "As an example, some bolometers convert the energy of the incident electromagnetic wave to heat-up a small resistance made of for example highly doped silicon or germanium. The small change in the resistance value due to the heating is detected by an electrical circuit, i.e. by detecting a bias change on the resistor. These kind of bolometers achieve a minimal detectable power from the detector, in other words a Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) sensitivity of 1 pW/sqrt(Hz) at 4 Kelvins, with a frequency response up to 50 kHz.",
                        "In other types of bolometers, the resistance is made of Niobium, which becomes a superconducting material when cooled below a critical temperature of 10 K. Such bolometers are operated just at the superconductor's critical temperature and rely on photon absorption. When a photon is absorbed, the bolometer switches to a normal state and produces a large change in resistance. Such bolometers achieve a Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) sensitivity of 1 pW/sqrt(Hz), with a bandwidth of up to 1 kHz, and operate at a cryogenic temperature of 8 Kelvins.",
                        "Other types of bolometers are Indium Antimonide (InSb) bolometers that, in combination with applied magnetic fields and cryogenic operation at a temperature of 4K, achieve detection with NEP=0.5 pW/sqrt(Hz) at frequency up to 500 kHz. All these bolometers, doped silicon or germanium, Niobium, and Indium Antimonide, can be operated in the electromagnetic frequency band 1-20 THz. However, they operate only at cryogenic temperatures (<10K).",
                        "In Golay cells, which operate in the range 1-50 THz, the terahertz radiation is transformed into heat thanks to an absorbing element placed within a gas-filled enclosure. The resulting increase in gas pressure pushes a flexible membrane, whose displacement may be detected optically. Being based on thermal effects and thermal distortion of the membrane, the response time is long by comparison with bolometers, but a Golay cell can operate at room temperature. Some commercial Golay cells achieve THz waves detection with 140 pW/sqrt(Hz) of sensitivity, up to a frequency of 20 Hz.",
                        "All these techniques have the drawbacks of operating at low temperature, having a long response time, or not operating at all frequencies within the terahertz domain. There is therefore a need for methods or devices allowing electromagnetic waves to be detected or transduced within the entire terahertz domain, at room temperature, with high sensitivity, with short response time, while maintaining the possibilities of miniaturization and integration.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "According to a first aspect, the present description relates to a detector for detecting terahertz electromagnetic waves. The detector comprises at least one first device configured to collect and transform an incident electromagnetic wave, having a terahertz frequency within a terahertz frequency band, into a measurable mechanical response; and a detection device for detecting an output signal. The first device comprising a first element and an opposite element forming with the first element a capacitive gap; said first element being a mechanical resonator having a mechanical resonance frequency and being configured to response mechanically to the action of a force stemming from an electric field, the output signal being representative of the mechanical response of the first element. The electric field is generated between at least one first electric pole induced in said first element, by first electric charges having a first electrical sign, and at least one second electric pole induced in said opposite element, by second electric charges having a second electrical sign opposite to the first electrical sign. The first device is a terahertz optomechanical transducer which is a terahertz electromagnetic resonator made at least of metal, configured to collect the incident terahertz electromagnetic wave and to transform the incident electromagnetic wave into a measurable mechanical response. The terahertz frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave corresponds to the electromagnetic resonance frequency of the terahertz electromagnetic resonator or is in a response frequency bandwidth of the terahertz electromagnetic resonator. The terahertz electromagnetic resonator comprises the first element and the opposite element. The first element and the opposite element comprise each at least an electrically conductive layer which is a metal pattern. The electric field is generated by interaction of said incident electromagnetic wave with electric charges in said terahertz electromagnetic resonator. The first electric charges and the second electric charges alternate in signs between the first and the second electric poles in time at the terahertz frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave.",
                        "This detector includes a terahertz (THz) optomechanical transducer that allows to transform an incident electromagnetic wave having a frequency within a terahertz frequency band into a measurable mechanical response. A coupling occurs between the terahertz photons of the incident electromagnetic wave and the mechanical response of the first element. A detection and measurement of the mechanical response may be performed for example by optical or electrical means.",
                        "The light-matter interaction occurring in the THz transducer relies on a mutual coupling between the incident electromagnetic waves and the electric charges present in the terahertz electromagnetic resonator. The incident electromagnetic wave interacts in a non-absorptive manner with electric charges present in the terahertz electromagnetic resonator (free carriers that may be present in a metal or superconductor part, or bound charges in parts made of a dielectric), driving them through forces, which are analog to Lorentz forces. The electromagnetic forces induced by the THz electromagnetic wave onto the electromagnetic/mechanical resonator may include radiation pressure effects, optical gradient forces, ponderomotive, electrostrictive, photoelastic forces, and piezoelectric and electrostatic effects. Whatever the electromagnetic forces generated by the THz electromagnetic wave, they do not rely on radiation absorption, and the electromagnetic THz forces can be seen as energy conservative. This is different from the class of bolometers, which rely on radiation absorption. As a first consequence, slow thermal effects originating from absorption of the THz electromagnetic wave do not rule the terahertz electromagnetic resonator operation. This allows the terahertz electromagnetic resonator to operate faster than bolometers, and also to transfer in a non-destructive manner the information carried by the electromagnetic wave onto the mechanical system. As a second consequence, the THz electromagnetic resonance of the transducer can be fixed by design of its geometrical characteristics, rather than the intrinsic physical properties of a constituent material (for instance, the presence of specific absorption bands).",
                        "The terahertz electromagnetic resonator is also referred to therein as a terahertz electromagnetic resonator or terahertz resonator.",
                        "In one or more embodiment, the first element is a mechanical resonator. The mechanical resonance frequency of this mechanical resonator is much lower, for example in the kHz, MHz or GHZ domain, than the electromagnetic resonance frequency of the terahertz electromagnetic resonator (in the THz domain) and may thus be easily detected, for example using an optical or electrical detection scheme.",
                        "According to another aspect, the present description relates to a detector for detecting electromagnetic waves, said detector comprising at least one optomechanical terahertz transducer according to the present disclosure and a detection device for detecting an output signal representative of a mechanical response of a first element of at least one of said optomechanical terahertz transducer.",
                        "The detector acts as a compact and efficient detector for THz electromagnetic waves. It operates at room temperature with a high frequency response (>1 MHz), well beyond the speed of Golay cells, pyroelectric detectors and cryogenic semiconductor bolometers. These properties make it an ideal detector for applications that rely on high speed bright sources such as synchrotrons or THz Quantum Cascade lasers.",
                        "In contrast with the prior art device disclosed in the patent application WO2006/055961A1 in which the electrostriction effect is the only effect which is used, there is no electrostriction effect (or this effect is negligible compared to the quasi-static Coulomb THz forces) in the electromagnetic/mechanical resonator disclosed therein. Further, in contrast again with this prior art device, no external electrical device (electrode, voltage generator, electrical device applying an external electrical field, etc) is necessary to produce an electrical field and a mechanical response of a first element. Especially, in the terahertz electromagnetic resonator disclosed therein, the electrical poles, and therefore the electrical field between these poles, are induced by the action of the THz electromagnetic wave on the electric charges in the terahertz electromagnetic resonator and the first element mechanically reacts (e.g. moves or deforms) naturally under the sole effect of the electromagnetic THz forces.",
                        "According to a second aspect, the present description relates to method for detecting an incident electromagnetic wave having a terahertz frequency within a terahertz frequency band of use. The method may use a detector according to the first aspect. The method comprises: transforming an incident electromagnetic wave having a terahertz frequency within a terahertz frequency band of use, into a measurable mechanical response; detecting an output signal representative of said mechanical response by the detection device of the detector, the amplitude of the output signal being proportional to the intensity of said incident electromagnetic wave. The step of transforming the incident electromagnetic wave into a measurable mechanical response comprises: collecting the incident electromagnetic wave by the terahertz optomechanical transducer of the detector, wherein the terahertz frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave corresponds to the electromagnetic resonance frequency of the terahertz electromagnetic resonator or is in a response bandwidth of the terahertz electromagnetic resonator; producing a mechanical response of the first element by action of a force stemming from an electric field generated by interaction of said electromagnetic wave on electric charges present in said terahertz electromagnetic resonator, wherein said electric field is generated between a first electric pole induced in said first element, by first electric charges having a first electrical sign and a second electric pole induced in said opposite element, by second electric charges having a second electrical sign opposite to the first electrical sign, and wherein the first electric charges and the second electric charges alternate in signs between the first and the second electric poles in time at the terahertz frequency of the incident electromagnetic wave.",

These poles are induced within the resonator when the latter is excited by an incident THz radiation. As the Coulomb force decreases with the distance between the poles, the resonators may be designed in such a way that this distance is minimal. Thus, the electric field that is induced between the two electrical poles is localized and concentrated in a very short distance and, at the same time, it has a very high amplitude. Such electric fields can be achieved in metallic resonators. For instance, in a split ring metallic resonator, there are two electrical poles that form around the slit of the resonator, when the latter is excited by an incident THz wave. At the same time, 90% of the electric energy density is localized around the slit. The Coulomb force between the poles is thus inversely proportional to the opening of the slit, which is typically between 10 nm and 10 micrometers.",

Under the effect of this modulation, the force stemming from the electric field is periodically changed with a typical frequency close to mechanical resonance.

Eventually all the charges on the capacitor will be gone and the voltage across it will reaches zero. However, the current will persist, because inductors resist changes in current. The current will begin to charge the capacitor with a voltage of opposite polarity to its original charge. When the magnetic field is completely dissipated the current will stop and the charges will again be stored in the capacitor, with the opposite polarity as before. Then the cycle will start again, with the current flowing in the opposite direction through the inductor. The charge flows back and forth between the plates of the capacitor, through the inductor.
