    "abstract": "In this work, a novel technique which allows every transmitter in an interference network to have global channel state information (CSI) is proposed. The key feature of the proposed technique is that each transmitter acquires global CSI purely through the available feedback channel (i.e., a feedback of the received signal power). In the first step of the proposed technique, each transmitter uses several observations provided by the feedback channel to learn the channel gains perceived by its intended receiver. Secondly, this information is quantized, modulated, and transmitted to the other transmitters through the power levels used by the transmitters; the latter are indirectly observed through the received signal power. Hence, the interference is used as an implicit communication channel through which local CSI is exchanged. Once global CSI is acquired, it can be used to optimize any utility function which depends on it.",

                "Interference networks are wireless networks which are largely distributed in the sense of decision making and/or available information. The distributed nature of these systems typically induces some performance loss compared to a centralized solution. Implementing coordination is a way of partially bridging this gap. In most of the literature on coordination among autonomous decision-makers, like team decision problems (see e.g., [1]), the typical assumption is that decision-makers have access to dedicated channels to coordinate their actions. These dedicated channels allow the decision-makers to signal or communicate with each other without affecting the objective or utility function [2]. Typically, in an interference network, when there is no direct line of communication between the transmitters; the transmitters use a distributed or selfish strategy and work at a sub-optimal level of performance. For example, in the case of a distributed interference network with multiple carriers, the iterative water-filling algorithm (IWFA) is considered to be one of the state-of-the art distributed techniques [3] [4]. IWFA-like distributed algorithms have at least two attractive features: they only rely on local knowledge e.g., the individual signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), making them distributed information-wise; the involved computational complexity is typically admissible. IWFA operates over a period which is less than the channel coherence time and it does so in two steps: an exploration phase during which the transmitters update in a round robin manner their power allocation vector; an exploration phase during which the transmitters keep their power levels constant and at the values obtained at the end of the first phase. One drawback of IWFA is that convergence is not always ensured [4] and, when converging, it leads to a Nash point which is typically globally inefficient. One important message of the present paper is to show that IWFA-like distributed algorithms do not exploit the available feedback signal efficiently. In the exploration phase, instead of using several time-slots (and their associated SINR realizations) to allow the transmitters to converge to a Nash point, the feedback signal realizations can be used to acquire global CSI. The merit of the proposed technique has therefore the potential to cope with the global inefficiency issue. As for complexity, it has to be managed by a proper choice of global utility function which has to maximized during the exploitation phase. The key idea we propose is that feedback signals such as the SINR can be used both to estimate local CSI and to exchange it through an appropriate power modulation scheme. This idea is somewhat related to the new concept of coded power control which has been introduced in [5] for two-user interference channels when one master transmitter knows perfectly future realizations of the global channel state. Here, we address the case of causal, local, and imperfect CSI over block-fading multiuser interference channels and provide a practical technique to implement such a information-theoretic concept."

The version of \u03c9 i which is assumed to be available at Transmitter i is obtained from a dequantization operation D and is denoted by r \u03c9 i ; it is therefore a noisy feedback (in contrast with the vast majority of papers related to the IWFA). The reason why we consider \u03c9 i as the feedback signal instead of the SINR is fourfold; (i) It can be noticed that \u03c9 i ptq \" g ii p i ptq \u02c6\u00b41 `1 \u03b3iptq \u00af.

                "This work provides a procedure by which the transmitters can estimate partial information on G and exchange this information to obtain the complete G. Once G is obtained a power vector p \u2039 can be found such that the network operates at an efficient point in terms of network utility. The process of achieving the desired power control vector is divided into three phases (see Fig. 2). The first phase is involved in estimating all the channel coefficients that are perceived by each receiver. Receiver i would estimate g i \" pg 1i , ..., g Ki q T . The second phase involves encoding this information into their transmit power levels as well as decoding the information received by observing -through the RS-the power levels of the other transmitters. The final phase would involve using all the collected information available to all the transmitters and setting the power control vector to the value obtained by optimizing u. Since the RS feedback is noisy and each transmitter has its own estimate for G, the vectors computed by the transmitters differ in general, leading to a distributed CSI scenario [7]. A flowchart of the proposed scheme is shown in Fig. 3.  The flowchart of the proposed scheme time-slot, each of the transmitters transmits at a power level given by p i ptq, t P t1, ..., T 1 u. This sequence of power vectors used for Phase 1 is assumed to be known to all transmitters and therefore has the role of a training sequence. A difference between classical training-based estimation and Phase 1 is that estimation is performed in the power domain with the help of several time-slots and not in the amplitude or data symbol domain within one time-slot. Working in the symbol domain would allow one to have access to h ij but the phase information on the channel coefficients is irrelevant regarding the utility function of the form upp; Gq.

With each of these labels, a sequence of T 2 power levels vector is associated, each level being in P. For this purpose, the classical iterative Lloyd-Max (LM) algorithm could be used in order to minimize the distortion on r g i . However, this algorithm assumes that there is no noise on the information source but p g i contains both quantization noise (induced by Q) and transmission noise (induced by the BSC). The more general scenario has been addressed in [10] where the authors exploit the statistical knowledge on the various noise sources to minimize the end-to-end distortion namely, the quantity E}p g j i \u00b4gi } 2 . To specify the corresponding quantizer, some notations are in order. Let \u03c6 be the p.d.f. of the noise due to channel estimation over Phase 1. Let \u03c0 n, be the transition probability of the discrete memoryless channel which corresponds to decoding as label the effectively transmitted label n. The generalized LM algorithm of [10] can be described for our problem as follows. First, select randomly d \" L T2 sites s , P t1, ..., du from a K-dimensional space. Then, the following steps are performed iteratively until the sites converge: 1. Compute the Voronoi region associated with each of these sites. For each site the corresponding Voronoi region R , P t1, ..., du is defined by the set of all points closer to that site than to any other, i.e., R \" tx P R K : }x \u00b4s } \u010f }x \u00b4sk }@k \u2030 u. 2.

As Q 2 pr g i q is quantized to d \" L T2 symbols, there are exactly as many symbols as power level vectors in phase 2 (for each transmitter i). Therefore any one-to-one mapping between the two sets results in the power control for phase 2. For example; let L \" 2 and T 2 \" 2, user 1 will quantize estimate and quantize pg 11 , g 2,1 q to 4 symbols (2 bits). Let's represent the symbols after quantization by A and B for each channel.
