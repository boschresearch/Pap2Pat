    "abstract": "A method of coordinating a transmitter with K\u22121 transmitters of a group of K transmitters. The K transmitters are in communication respectively with K receivers via channels that are described, for a frequency band m by direct transmission channel gains (gji,m) when j=i and by interfering transmission channel gains (gji,m) when j\u2260i between the transmitter j and the receiver i, i\u03b5{1, . . . , K}, j\u03b5{1, . . . , K}, K>1. Each transmitter has available an estimate of the direct channel gain and estimates of the gains of channels interfering with its receiver. The method includes an \u201cexchange\u201d stage during which the K transmitters transmit simultaneously K respective sequences of subframes of respective power levels per band m coding the estimated channel gains (\u011dji,m) and during which the K transmitters receive, after each subframe, signal to interference plus noise ratios as returned by the K receivers to their respective transmitters.",

                        "The present invention relates to the field of telecommunications. Within this field, the invention relates to techniques for coordinating transmitters (whether using the same technology or different technologies) that are making use of common radio resources in the same geographical zone, i.e. in a zone where communications by one transmitter disturb communications by another, where there is said to be an interference phenomenon. The invention lies in the context of a telecommunications system having K transmitters and K receivers that communicate respectively with the K transmitters. A transmitter may equally well be a base station or an access point to an access network.",
                        "The interference phenomenon can be limited by coordination mechanisms controlled by a central communications entity, providing there exists an infrastructure, or \u201cbackhaul\u201d, to convey the control and signalling signals between the transmitters, the receivers, and the central entity. Nevertheless, such mechanisms consume bandwidth. Also, such an infrastructure is absent when a transmitter is making use of a frequency band without a \u201cfree band\u201d license (or \u201cwhite space\u201d) and so there can be no possible coordination. In particular concerning transmissions based on Wi-Fi type wireless technology that rely on standards of the IEEE 802.11 series, their quality is threatened by the explosion in the number of things in communication with the Internet of things (IoT) and by the explosion of distribution networks with automatic return of information (smart grids). Cellular networks are not free of this risk, since the trend for future deployments consists in deploying small, or \u201cfemto\u201d, cells between base stations in order to increase capacity while limiting backhaul infrastructure, which goes against the need for coordination mechanisms to combat interference."

                        "In the context of the invention, communications between transmitters and receivers are considered as passing via a so-called \u201cequivalent\u201d channel. The term equivalent channel is used to cover both the propagation channel itself and also the linear filtering operations that take place on transmission and on reception and that lead to the mathematical structure of the signal to noise plus interference ratio that is used. Below, the generic term \u201cchannel\u201d is used instead of and replacing the term \u201cequivalent channel\u201d. The term \u201cgain\u201d is used relative to an (equivalent) channel to designate the square of the modulus of the dominant coefficient of the impulse response of the channel, the square of the modulus of the frequency response of the channel for a frequency m, or indeed the ratio between the signal power received by the receiver over the entire band m and the transmitted power, i.e. the ratio that would be measured if there were no interference from other transmitters. The \u201cchannel\u201d or \u201cfrequency\u201d index m may take any one value selected from M values. The term \u201cM\u201d is used to designate the number of return channels available for the communications system under consideration, each return channel being characterized by its own signal to noise plus interference ratio SINR.",
                        "From [1], it is known to use a transmitted power pattern that can provide a basis for channel measurements that can be returned at the end of each transmitted power level.",
                        "From [2], an algorithm is known for allocating power transmitted by a transmitter during communication with a receiver via a point-to-point link. That algorithm is known as the iterative waterfilling algorithm (IWFA). Power is allocated between the M orthogonal channels of the point-to-point link while making use solely of knowledge about the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) that is known for each of these frequency channels, M\u22671. The channel gains/coefficients are assumed either to be constant or else to be piecewise constant. Under such circumstances, the channel gains are thus steady over a duration referred to as the coherence time Tc. In a preferred mode, the IWFA operates on a duration T shorter than or equal to the coherence time, T\u2266Tc. The algorithm considers a telecommunications system with K transmitters and K receivers, K\u22672. The IWFA algorithm subdivides time into successive frames, and each frame has K subframes. The duration of a frame corresponds to the duration of an iteration of the IWFA algorithm. A transmitter can update the allocated power only once per frame. The frame thus corresponds to the minimum duration needed to enable the K transmitters to update their allocated powers. The algorithm considers an arbitrary order between the transmitters for updating their powers. Without loss of generality, the transmitter 1 is the transmitter that updates first, and so on. The IWFA algorithm implicitly assumes a frame level synchronization mechanism (outer loop) and a timeslot level synchronization mechanism corresponding to a subframe (inner loop).",

The method comprises:\n\n\n- - an \u201cexchange\u201d stage during which the K transmitters transmit\n    simultaneously K respective sequences of T2 subframes of T2\n    respective power levels per band m coding the estimated channel\n    gains and during which the K transmitters receive, after each\n    subframe, SINR estimates based on observations of a received signal\n    as returned by the K receivers to their respective transmitters,\n    T2\u22671.",
                        "Known techniques exist that enable a transmitter i to know the estimate of the direct channel gain gii,m and the estimates of the gains gji,m of the channels interfering with its receiver i, j\u2260i. During the exchange stage, the transmitters exchange their estimated channel gains by encoding them using power level coding. The coefficients gii,m, gij,m may equally well model the attenuation coefficients associated with propagation (path loss) or the attenuation coefficients associated with slow fading (shadowing) or with fast fading.",
                        "A transmitter thus transmits in succession T2 subframes in which the associated power levels code the channel gain estimates known to the transmitter. The receiver returns an estimated signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) to its transmitter at the end of a subframe. The estimate is made on the basis of observations of the received signal while the K transmitters are simultaneously transmitting respective subframes. The estimated SINR as returned may equally well be expressed in the form of an estimate of the available power and of an estimate of the interfering power including noise, or in the form of an estimate of the ratio of these powers, or in any other form that makes it possible to deduce the SINR.",
                        "The estimate is generally noisy, in particular given that the information returned by the return channel is quantized. The returned estimate may be the result of averaging. Example, in a band m that comprises a plurality of narrowband sub carriers, averaging may consist in making the estimate over all of the sub carriers or over a subset of them. At the end of the succession of T2 subframes, a transmitter thus has T2 estimates of a signal to noise plus interference ratio as evaluated by its receiver. After the last subframe, the transmitter i has a system of T2 equations in T2\u00d7(K\u22121) unknowns, which are the powers transmitted by the K\u22121 transmitters and received by its receiver. For the transmitter i, the power levels transmitted by the other transmitters may be estimated by selecting the sequence that is the most likely in the maximum likelihood sense. Knowing the powers transmitted by the other transmitters, the transmitter can determine the corresponding channel gains by decoding the power levels of the transmitted powers. Finally, at the end of the exchange stage, each transmitter knows all of the channel gains. Thus, each transmitter can determine its own transmission power in compliance with a criterion for minimizing global interference for the set of K transmitters. Thus, the method of the invention converges on a power allocation with efficiency that is global, i.e. that is evaluated at system level, as contrasted with the IWFA algorithm that converges on a power allocation with efficiency that is local, i.e. that is evaluated at transmitter level. Unlike the IWFA algorithm, the method of the invention does not rely on an iterative process, thus making it possible to avoid the convergence problem of the IWFA algorithm. Also, the invention is compatible with all kinds of utility function that may be selected solely on the basis of power control policies and of the channel gains of the communications system under consideration.",
                        "In an embodiment, channel gains are estimated during an acquisition stage of acquiring transmission channel gains on a frequency band m between the transmitter j and the receiver i, during which the K transmitters transmit simultaneously respective sequences of T1 subframes of T1 respective determined power levels and during which the K transmitters receive, after each subframe, estimates of respective SINRs returned by the K receivers to their respective transmitters.",
                        "In this implementation, the method includes a particular acquisition stage. In this acquisition stage, the transmitters contributing to coordination transmit a succession of T1 power levels that are the equivalent of a training sequence. These training sequences are known to the transmitters, i.e. a transmitter knows the power levels transmitted in succession during the T1 subframes by each of the K\u22121 transmitters. A transmitter estimates the received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) T1 times. At the end of a subframe, the receiver returns, the estimated value of the SINR to its transmitter. At the end of the training sequence, a transmitter thus has T1 estimates of a signal to noise plus interference ratio as estimated by its receiver. The SINR may be expressed in the following general form:",
