                                "Several applications and data resources exist for predicting the effects of individual nucleotide substitutions. These can be broadly classified into one of two categories: 1) resources that provide predictions about pathogenicity of genetic variants in absence of human genotype-phenotype association data, and 2) resources that seek to apply previous human genotype-phenotype association data to re-sequencing (or other genotype) data. The first group of resources utilizes characteristics of amino acid substitutions, putative change in protein secondary structure, disruption of known structural motifs, and several derivative metrics of evolutionary conservation and constraint to provide predictions about pathogenicity of single nucleotide substitutions. The second group of resources links data from previous linkage studies, family co-segregation data, genome wide association scans, and other sources into searchable databases of genotype-phenotype associations.",
                                "The first set of resources, while suited to annotation of individual variants with no human genotype-phenotype association data, ignores the large repository of data connecting genetic variation with human disease phenotypes, and provides no clinical context for interpretation of variant annotations. The second set of resources is not well suited to annotation of comprehensive re-sequencing data, contains annotation errors and common polymorphisms, by some estimates comprising approximately >25% of the entries, and is contaminated by descriptions of trait susceptibility loci of questionable clinical relevance.",
                                "There does not yet exist, to date, a readily available pipeline for comprehensive clinical interpretation of sequence variants that integrates predicted methods and the bulk of published disease-genotype associations for genetic assessment of inherited disease risk and predicted drug response. Embodiments of the present invention address certain of these shortcomings of the prior art.",
                                "Sequence to Medical Phenotypes",
                                "Shown in FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a method according to an embodiment of the present invention generating sequence-to-medical-phenotypes information. As shown, at steps 202 and 204 digitized genomic information is received such as may be generated from a primary sequence analysis. Among other things, sequence alignment and variant identification information is received. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, at step 202, variants from a reference are received in the form of .vcf or .gff files. The .vcf file is generally used to input variant call information but other similar files are appropriate as they may exist or be developed. The .gff file is generally used to provide general feature information about genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences but other similar files are appropriate as they may exist or be developed. Also, binary alignment information is received in the form of a .bam file. Information that can be received as input includes variant call files for single nucleotide variants and indels (SNVs, indels) and, optionally, genomic feature format files for structural variants (SVs). Other information as it may exist or may be subsequently developed can be input as would be known to those of ordinary skill in the art upon and understanding of the present disclosure. This received input is then referenced against rare SNVs, SVs, and indels 206.",
                                "It should be noted that embodiments of the present invention are shown and described in a pipeline fashion that is amenable to efficient pipeline computerized processing. For example, certain of the steps to be described may be independent of other steps such that they can be performed independently on different processors or processing cores. Moreover, embodiments of the present invention balance the overall methods among various coprocessors. In this way, as additional computational needs are required for certain steps, more processors or processing cores can be dedicated to such steps. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that there are many ways of balancing computational resources in a pipeline architecture such as described in embodiment of the present invention.",
                                "At step 205, targeted genotype calling is performed. In an embodiment of the present invention, targeted genotype calling is performed with reference to rare disease risk genotypes 208 and drug response phenotypes 210. In another embodiment of the present invention, the computerized task for targeted genotype calling is mapped to a plurality of processors among available processors. The assignment of the number of processors can, for example, be specified through a command line interface, a graphical interface, or through an input file.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, a GATK haplotype caller is used for indels and a unified genotype caller for SNVs. In an embodiment, call genotypes are made from the BAM file (if specified) for known rare disease risk variants and drug response variants using, for example, the Human Gene Mutation Database variants in Clinvar and pharmGKB, respectively.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, calls are filtered using hard filtering based on, for example, quality, depth, mapping quality, and allele balance. In yet another embodiment, calls are re-annotated to add dbsnp identifiers.",
                                "Primary genotype annotation is then performed at step 211 using the results from the queries of rare SNvs, SVs, and indels 206 and rare disease risk genotypes 208. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, genotype annotation is performed for all variants from the received reference at step 202. In such an embodiment, a .vcf file is used along with an optional .gff input file.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, as part of primary genotype annotation 211, a conversion is made to annovar file input format. Conversion to such format facilitates the use of certain computerized methods for functionally annotating genetic variants detected from diverse genomes. For example, with a list of variants with chromosome, start position, end position and observed nucleotides, computerized methods using annovar can identify whether SNPs or indels cause protein coding changes among other things. As noted previously, embodiments of the present invention lend themselves to pipelined processing and processing among various processors or cores. For example, here, individual annovar annotation processes are mapped to a pool of n processes.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, intermediate annotation files are created for each of the received datasets (e.g., SNVs, SVs, and indels). Also, the plurality of individual annotations files is collected and reduced to two files (e.g., *.allvars.genome_summary.tsv, and .clinvar.genome_summary.tsv, representing annotated variants from reference and annotated known rare disease risk genotypes) for SNVs/indes1 and one file for SVs (e.g., *.sys.genome_summary.tsv). Such files can be, for example, text files in a tab separated format.",
                                "Rare variants in inherited disease genes are then identified at step 212. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, rare variants in inherited disease genes are categorized into a plurality of tiers. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, Tier 1 represents rare loss of function variants, where rarity is generally defined as variants with the highest allele frequency below user-defined threshold in user defined population background (e.g., CEU, Caucasian, CHB/JPT, East Asian, AFR, African). Tier 2 represents rare missense or non-frameshift indels affecting nucleotides with consensus evidence by both algorithms considered for evolutionary conservation/constraint according to the following values cataloged in the database of nonsynonymous functional predictions28: GERP++score>2; PhyloPnew>0.95. Tier 3 represents rare missense or non-frameshift indels with predicted pathogenicity by three or more algorithms according to the following definitions as cataloged in the database of nonsynoymous functional predictions28: SIFT, \u201cDamaging;\u201d LRT, \u201cDeleterious;\u201d PolyPhen2, \u201cProbably damaging\u201d or \u201cPossibly damaging;\u201d Mutation taster, \u201cDisease causing automatic\u201d or \u201cdisease causing.\u201d In an embodiment, outputs from step 212 are included as information for inherited disease risk candidates 220. In an embodiment not shown in FIG. 2, Tier 4 represents all rare variants not meeting criteria for Tiers 1-3.",
                                "As a final filter for both previously reported variants in monogenic disease genes and previously unreported, rare variants in monogenic disease genes, an embodiment of the present invention uses catalogs of local allele frequency and genotype information to exclude variants that are observed more frequently than would be expected in the local sequencing environment (according to user defined criteria). This filter serves to identify and exclude variants whose previously unappreciated high allele frequency is a result of false negatives in population genetic surveys or systematic false positives specific to the sequence assessment pipeline. Similar filters have proven effective in excluding such systematic artifacts in other contexts.",
                                "As would be known to those of ordinary skill in the art upon an understanding of the present invention, the criteria for the various tiers can be modified to meet particular needs that may arise in different situations.",
                                "Known variants in inherited disease genes are identified at step 214. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, known variants in inherited disease genes are categorized into a plurality of tiers. For example as shown in FIG. 2, Tier 1 represents loss of function variants (e.g., splice dinucleotide disrupting, nonsense, nonstop, and frameshift indels). Tier 2 represents rare variants cataloged in HGMD, regardless of functional annotation. Rarity is generally defined as transcription factor MAF no greater than 1% in any of the following population genetic surveys: ethnically-matched population in HapMap 2 and 3, the 1000 genomes phase 1 data27 from an ethnically-matched super population, and global allele frequency, the 1000 genomes pilot 1 project global allele frequency, 69 publicly available genomes released by Complete Genomics, and the NHLBI Grand Opportunity exome sequencing project global allele frequency. Tier 3 represents all non-rare missense and non-frameshift indels. In an embodiment, outputs from step 212 are included as information for inherited disease risk candidates 220. In an embodiment not shown in FIG. 2, Tier 4 represents all rare variants not meeting criteria for Tiers 1-3.",

                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, rare SVs in inherited disease genese (e.g., genes specified by a user or in an clinvar default) are filtered by a predetermined allele frequency in allele frequency databases using a rarity criteria as discussed above. In an embodiment, these criteria are user specified. Information is retained if it is predicted to cause exonic disruption (e.g., annotated as exonic) of inherited disease genes. In an embodiment, user input information (e.g., user input or input files) identifies inherited disease genes for individuals.",
                                "Haplotype assignment is then performed at step 213 as shown in FIG. 2 using the targeted genotypes of steps 205/208/210. For example, in an embodiment to the present invention, star allele haplotype assignment is performed as follows. Skeleton haplotype pairs are created using all confidently identified homozygous SNVs and indels. The full set of complementary haplotypes is then generated using heterozygous variant calls. In an embodiment, a perfect match search is performed for each haplotype and its complement among the described haplotypes defining the known \u201cstar\u201d alleles associated with clinical drug response. In an embodiment, if a perfect match is not found, the set of possible haplotype pairs is given but no star allele assignment is attempted. Also, if more than one pair of possible star alleles is found matching possible haplotypes generated from WGS data, all possible star allele combinations are reported. An embodiment does not provide haplotype resolution beyond that suggested by the confidently called genotypes.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 2, pharmacogenomics haplotypes and genotypes are identified at steps 216 and 218, respectively. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, pharmacogenomics haplotypes and genotypes are categorized into a plurality of tiers. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, Tier 1 represents haplotype and genotype assignments per CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) dosing guidelines. In an embodiment, an analysis is performed for every gene haplotype definition map in a collection (e.g., a resource folder). In an embodiment, using star alleles called in Haplotype Assignment 213 set, merge diplotypes (haplotype pairs) with CPIC annotations, providing drug disease and administration guidelines for simvastatin, warfarin, clopidogrel, thiopurines, and codeine (e.g., a default condition) or more comprehensive annotations as updated in a resource folder. In an embodiment, the output of Tier 1 includes drug/haplotype combinations for a predetermined set (e.g., as contained in a resource folder). Tier 2 represents Pgx haplotypes and genotypes meeting predetermined scored clinical evidence. For example, using targeted genotypes identified in Targeted Genotype calling steps 205/208/210 above, information is merged with PharmGKB clinical annotations (default) or used with provided annotations as updated in a resource folder, for example, to provide drug response predictions for individual variant genotypes scored by level of clinical evidence, type of association, drug, association, ethnic background. In an embodiment, the output for Tier 2 includes dosage, efficacy, and toxicity information. In still another embodiment, other information can be identified for output. The collection of the results of Tiers 1 and 2 provide drug response prediction information 222 as shown in FIG. 2.",
                                "Embodiments of the present invention find wide application in genomics. For example, applications for embodiments of the present invention include: 1) Identification of medically actionable genetic variants with disease risk implications in pre-symptomatic individuals in WGS data; 2) Identification of genetic variants in WGS associated with drug response; and 3) Identification of genetic variants in WGS associated with disease in families and individuals.",
                                "Embodiments of the present invention present advantages over the prior ar. For example, embodiments of the present invention include fully integrated sets of methods for clinical interpretation of whole genome sequence data. Also, the present invention provides methods for automated haplotype identification and comprehensive annotation of drug response predictions from whole genome sequence data. Embodiments of the present invention provide methods for identifying apparent de novo mutations in father-mother-child trios while excluding systematic artifacts. Also, embodiments seamlessly integrate with a variety of variant call outputs and sequence maps. Embodiments also provide reference-agnostic disease risk prediction and provide comprehensive disease risk prediction and drug response prediction using efficient and fast methods and data sources for haplotype determination and annotation."

                                "High-throughput re-sequencing with current sequencing platforms requires a reference genome for sequence assembly and variant identification. The reference genome that is currently used for alignment of human re-sequencing data and variant identification (the NCBI reference genome) is derived from a collection of DNA samples from a small number of anonymous volunteers. It is currently the only \u201cfinished-grade\u201d human genome in that it was assembled de-novo from long sequence reads and covers approximately 99% of the euchromatic human genome. However, it represents a small sampling of human genetic variation. As such, at approximately 1.6 million genomic positions, the NCBI reference sequence differs from the major allele in each of the three Haplotype Map (HapMap) populations, and at approximately 800,000 positions, the minor allele for all three population groups is represented on the NCBI reference sequence. These minor alleles span approximately 4,500 variant positions associated with common complex disease traits.",
                                "To address these issues, a major allele reference sequence for each of the three major HapMap populations was developed. This is utilized it in mapping short read data and variant identification using high-throughput sequencing. Application of this approach to variant identification in whole genome sequence data from a nuclear family of four reduced genotype error by approximately 40% at disease-associated variant loci and resulted in greater concordance with genotype calls from orthogonal genotyping technologies.",
                                "In an embodiment of the present invention, the methods of the present invention can use major allele reference genomes if the ethnicity of study participants is known. In an alternative embodiment, it may be preferable to use standard (or SNP-masked) standard reference sequences if ethnicity is not known or if performing joint genotype calling of a multi-ethnic study cohort. In the latter case, alignment can be performed using an ethnicity-specific major allele reference to maximize sensitivity of short read alignment, and a standard or SNP-masked standard reference sequence may be used for variant and genotype identification, thereby standardizing the reference allele in the variant call file.",
                                "There are well-document disease risk and drug response alleles in the reference sequence, most notably Factor V Leiden allele associated with hereditary thrombophilia. Comparison of genome sequence data that is homozygous for these alleles to this reference sequence will naturally not produce a variant call. This issue is partially addressed by the use of major allele reference sequences. A more comprehensive approach is to perform targeted genotype calling of all loci considered to be of phenotypic importance. This approach is reference agnostic up to reference bias associated with short read alignment and mapping. Embodiments of the present invention use input interval call files representing previously reported Mendelian disease associated loci and loci associated with drug response to provide targeted genotype calls, irrespective of reference base, using the GATK Unified Genotyper (for SNVs) and Haplotype Caller (for indels). Embodiments of the present invention also provide metrics for coverage of loci with known importance to human health and disease, thereby providing confidence that a disease-associated allele is indeed not present, rather than just under-sequenced or otherwise not confidently ascertained. As compared with methods that store diploid calls for all reference genomic positions, the approach to genotype interrogation facilitates downstream variant annotation while minimizing storage requirements for variant data. To facilitate updated genotype identification as new loci of relevance to human health and disease are discovered, binary alignment (BAM) files from the secondary sequence analysis are retained for future analysis.",

The annovar framework was extended to provide rich gene-based, functional genomic, regulatory, allele frequency, and phenotypic annotation. This basic annotation pipeline, stanovar, provides 94 annotations for SNVs and indels in .vcf format (Table 1 attached as Appendix A) and 39 annotations for SVs in .gff format (Table 2 attached as Appendix B).",

An embodiment of the present invention uses a prioritization heuristic that at once provides a parsimonious set of candidates for manual review and a comprehensive assessment of previously reported genetic variation.",

In an embodiments, the known variants in high impact genes are categorized into tiers (e.g., Tiers 1-3) in a similar manner as discussed above. For example, in an embodiment, Tier 1 represents loss of function candidates (e.g., (splice dinucleotide disrupting, nonsense, nonstop, and frameshift indels). Tier 2 represents rare non-loss-of-function variants. In an embodiment, Tier 2 represents rare variants cataloged in HGMD, regardless of functional annotation.

Approaches to rating the potential pathogenicity of variants based on consensus of commonly used prediction algorithms have been shown to have superior calibration and discriminative accuracy when compared with individual predictions.

To do this embodiment first creates skeleton haplotype pairs using all confidently identified homozygous SNVs.

A perfect-match search is performed for each haplotype and its complement among described haplotypes defining the known \u201cstar\u201d alleles associated with clinical drug response.

                                "Genome-wide genetic interrogation in father-mother-child trios with apparently simplex phenotypes can be a powerful tool for genetic association discovery. Classically these investigations are performed using discrete filtering to identify apparent de novo, compound heterozygous, and rare homozygous mutations. De novo mutations are typically discovered via searching for Mendelian inheritance abnormalities (MIAs) that are consistent with the segregation of phenotypes within the family. Discrete filtering is encumbered by several challenges, however. First, the true per-generation de novo mutation rate is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the sequence error rate using current high throughput sequencing technology. In addition to stochastic error modes, there are systematic error modes arising from sequences in the human reference genome that are compressed relative to common repetitive sequences, low complexity and GC and homopolymer rich regions, and other regions of the human genome that are problematic to accurately sequence, align, or genotype. Roach, et al, developed an HMM-based classifier to identify these regions in family quartets and also to provide relative inheritance state information for WGS. An embodiment of the present invention utilizes a simplified HMM classifier that bins WGS or WES data into one of three categories (three hidden states): \u201cgood data\u201d, \u201ccompression\u201d, or \u201cMIA-rich\u201d regions. The latter two categories represent variant data that is highly likely to contain systematic artifact and can be excluded from downstream analysis and-or interpretation. An embodiment writes this information in the \u201cFilter\u201d field of standard vcf output, allowing for soft-filtering or manual inspection of these regions. An embodiment uses chromosomal distance between variant markers as a prior expectation in the HMM, thereby facilitating for the first time the use of this HMM-based approach in WES, which by virtue of sequence capture is sparse outside targeted regions and dense within targeted regions.",
                                "Second, apparently simplex disease phenotypes can arise from a variety of possible underlying genetic architectures and modes of inheritance, and pre-specifying one mode can lead to a lack of sensitivity. To address this, once HMM-based regional classification has been performed, an embodiment of the present invention will output 1) apparent de novo events, 2) all instances of compound heterozygosity in a gene in which at least one variant in the pair is rare according to user specific criteria 3) rare homozygous mutations, and 4) instances of apparent hemizygosity which are candidates for loss of function, 5) rare variants in known inherited disease genes fitting an autosomal dominant inheritance model with reduced penetrance. This output can be used for manual inspection in single trio studies or as a prior expectation for gene regions fed forward into collapsing statistics if a cohort of trios is studied. In the latter case an embodiment leverages inheritance information to reduce the number of gene regions queried and thus the number of statistical comparisons performed between case and control cohorts.",

Optional inputs include 1) binary alignment map file, required for targeted genotype calling and annotation of known inherited disease risk alleles and pharmacogenomic annotation, 2) genome feature format file describing structural variant events, 3) local site frequency spectrum for filtering of inherited disease risk candidates. In trio mode, an embodiment requires jointly called genotypes and sample identifiers for father, mother, and child. Initial annotation of genetic variants for gene, functional genomic, and clinical phenotypes (stanovar) is performed using python/perl and parallelized using the \u201cmultiprocessing\u201d module in python. Processing time for stanovar scales roughly as 1/n, where n is the number of processors allocated to the task. An embodiment is implemented in cython/python/shell and also parallelized using the \u201cmultiprocessing\u201d modules in python.",
