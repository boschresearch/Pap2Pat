A method as described above is known from Andrew E. Derome, \u201cModern NMR Techniques for Chemistry Research\u201d, Pergamon Press, 1987.",
                        "Double-resonance techniques were first introduced into high-resolution CW-NMR by Bloch in 1954.[1] Bloom and Shoolery[2] have shown that the application of an rf field B2 to 31P nuclei such that \u03b3B2>>2\u03c0|J| can lead to the collapse of the doublet in the 19F spectrum arising from a heteronuclear coupling J(31P-19F). Freeman and Anderson[3, 4]proposed a theoretical description that is applicable to spin systems with either homo- or heteronuclear couplings and explains the spectral complexities and multiplicities arising from the secondary rf field B2 while sweeping the frequency of the main rf field B1 to observe the response in CW (=continuous wave) fashion. In particular, information about the topology of non-degenerate energy levels and the relative signs of coupling constants can be extracted.[5, 6]A detailed discussion of these effects, which have later become known as \u201cspin tickling\u201d experiments, has been presented elsewhere.[7, 8] Ever since, the development of advanced methods for the characterization of more and more complex systems (often in biomolecules) has been accompanied by a desire to achieve a gain in resolution and spectral simplification. The removal of homonuclear scalar interactions can simplify assignments in overlapping regions in both 1D and 2D spectra, and a number of methods have been proposed to eliminate the fine structure due to J-couplings.[9-15] However, none of these methods appear to have found widespread applications. Moreover, they usually only achieve a decoupling effect in the indirect dimension of 2D spectra. A method similar to the above is known as homonuclear decoupling, where a weak rf field of constant amplitude is applied throughout the observation of the signal. This method suffers from problems of interference between rf irradiation and signal observation, and is difficult to extend to multiple frequencies.",

                        "This object is achieved by that one or more tickling rf (=radio frequency) pulses of duration \u03c4p are applied within each dwell time \u0394t, and that the average rf field amplitude of each of the tickling rf pulses is between \u03c91=\u03c91\u03c4p/\u0394t=\u03c0/10J and \u03c91=\u03c91\u03c4p/\u0394t=10\u03c0J, wherein J being the scalar J-coupling constant and \u03c91=\u03b3B1 with \u03b3 being the gyromagnetic ratio and B1 being the strength of the magnetic component of each tickling rf pulse. Decoupling of homonuclear scalar interactions in J-coupled spin systems in high-resolution NMR spectra of solutions can be achieved by applying brief but fairly intense radio-frequency (rf) \u201ctickling\u201d pulses in the intervals (dwell times) between the acquisition of data points. The average rf field amplitude, i.e., the peak amplitude scaled by the duty cycle, should approximately satisfy the condition \u03c91\u2248\u03c0J. It is considered sufficient if <\u03c91> is between (\u03c0/10)J and 10\u03c0J for the method to work. The method is effective over a wide range of chemical shift differences between the J-coupled pairs of nuclei.",
                        "This invention presents a 1D technique to remove homonuclear scalar interactions by applying a train of brief rf-pulses. This method may be seen as a combination of Fourier and tickling spectroscopy. In the spirit of self-deprecating acronyms such as INEPT and INADEQUATE, we like to refer to our method as Window-Acquired Spin Tickling Experiment (WASTE). The new method has been tested on proton spectra of a series of samples ranging from moderately strongly- to weakly-coupled spin systems.",
                        "A preferred variant of the inventive method is characterized in that the average rf field amplitude of each of the tickling rf pulses fulfils the condition: \u03c91=\u03c91\u03c4p/\u0394t=\u03c0J.",
                        "While the method seems to work properly with values of <\u03c91> only approximately reaching \u03c0J, \u03c91=\u03c0J is found to be the optimal condition.",
                        "A further advantageous variant of the inventive method is characterized in that the duration \u03c4p of the tickling pulses is between 0,1 \u03bcs and 20 \u03bcs, preferably about 1 \u03bcs. Tickling rf pulses of shorter or longer duration appear to lead to unwanted side effects.",

The tall rectangle represents the initial excitation pulse whereas the small rectangle represents a tickling pulse of duration \u03c4p applied along the x axis. The black dot represents the acquisition of a single data point. If the receiver runs continuously, this data point is obtained by averaging over all data points acquired in the interval during which the receiver is activated. The Driven Induction Decay (DID) is built up by acquiring n data points through an n-fold repetition of the loop.",
                        "Decoupling of homonuclear scalar interactions JAX in coupled spin systems can be achieved by applying brief but fairly intense radio-frequency (rf) \u201ctickling\u201d pulses (typically with a duration \u03c4p=1 \u03bcs and an rf amplitude 2<\u03c91/(2\u03c0)<3 kHz) between the acquisition of data points. These are separated by intervals (\u201cdwell times\u201d) that may be typically \u0394t=100 \u03bcs if the desired spectral width is 10 kHz. As will be explained below, the average rf field amplitude \u03c91=\u03c91\u03c4p/\u0394t should approximately satisfy the condition \u03c91=\u03c0J. If one \u201ctickles\u201d spin A by placing the carrier frequency of on the chemical shift \u03a9A, the fine-structure due to JAX collapses in both A and X multiplets. In \u201clinear\u201d AMX three-spin systems with JAX=0 Hz, tickling the central spin M eliminates both interactions JAM and JMX. As a result, all three multiplets collapse and the spectrum shows only three singlets at the isotropic chemical shifts \u03a9A, \u03a9M and \u2022\u03a9X. However, in a general AMX three-spin system with if JMX\u22600 where only spin M is tickled, the multiplicity due to JAX is retained for both non-irradiated A and X spins.",

As usual in Fourier spectroscopy, the signal is observed at regular intervals \u0394t (dwell times) that are inversely proportional to the desired spectral width, so as to fulfil the Nyquist condition. A tickling pulse of length \u03c4p and constant rf amplitude \u03c91=\u03b3B1 is applied near the middle of each \u0394t interval. A so-called Driven Induction Decay (DID) can be acquired by repeating the loop n times until one obtains the desired number of points. Numerical simulations have been performed with the SIMPSON program.[16] Relaxation effects have not been taken into account in this study. The rf carrier of the tickling pulses is set on resonance with the spin A, i.e. \u03c9rf=\u03c9A, so that its offset vanishes, \u03a9A=\u03a9A\u2212\u03a9rf=0.

If \u03a91>>\u03a9X, the evolution of the magnetization associated with both spins would be completely suppressed in the limit of continuous irradiation when \u03c91=\u03c91 (spin-locking), so that one expects a single unmodulated signal at \u03a9A=0 Hz.

                        "Although the condition \u0394v(c)=0 of Eq. 6 is violated by a factor of 2, the intensity of the central peak is enhanced. Thus, when the rf amplitude \u03c91 is increased, the splitting between the single-quantum transitions induced by a violation of Eq. 6 does not significantly broaden the central line, while the tickling sidebands are reduced. The integrals of all three spectra are conserved.",
                        "The requirement that the scalar coupling term in the average Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) be made ineffective (on the condition that the sampling be stroboscopic) implies that the degrees of freedom of the evolution of the density operator must be severely curtailed. In simple terms, if we start with in-phase terms such as IxA, IyA, IxX and IyX, efficient decoupling means that it should be made impossible to convert these initial states into anti-phase terms such 2IxAIzX, 2IyAIzX, 2IzAIxX and 2IzAIyX. It turns out that, if we start with IxA, and if the offset \u03a9A vanishes, coherence transfer is constrained to a Liouville subspace spanned by a triad of non-commuting operators {IxA, 2IyAIzX, 2IzAIzX}.",
                        "FIG. 9 shows a simulation of the time dependence of these three product operators and of their norm, defined as N=(IxA2+2IyAIzX2+2IzAIzX2)1/2 (continuous line) during a typical tickling experiment. Since the norm of these three operators is constant, coherence transfer must be confined to the subspace spanned by the triad of non-commuting operators. If we start with the in-phase term IxA, the J-coupling tends to convert it into an anti-phase operator 2IyAIzX, but this process is stopped by the transformation of 2IyAIzX into longitudinal two-spin order 2IzAIzX due to the tickling pulses. As a result, the oscillations of the in-phase term IxA are kept to a minimum. This amounts to successful decoupling. Similar phenomena were observed in a different context and dubbed \u201cstabilization by interconversion within a triad of coherences under multiple refocusing pulses\u201d (SITCOM).[23, 24] Of course, in the tickling experiments presented here, the brief pulses do not have any refocusing effect, but the stabilizing effect is similar.",
                        "Although the analogies may seem far-fetched, Fourier tickling achieves similar effects as repeated projective measurements, where the system is not confined to a single state, but evolves under the action of its Hamiltonian in a multidimensional subspace of Hilbert space. It may be helpful to ponder about possible variants in the light of these analogies.[26-30]",
                        "All the experiments were carried out in a static field B0=11.7 T (500 MHz for proton). At this field, the two protons of 2,3-dibromothiophene in DMSO-d6 are weakly coupled with (\u03a9A\u2212\u03a9X)/(2\u03c0)\u02dc305 Hz and JAX\u02dc5.8 Hz.",
                        "In FIG. 10, the unperturbed spectrum is compared with the best tickling spectrum. The carrier frequency was set on the left-hand resonance, as indicated by a wavy arrow. Good decoupling and minimal interference of tickling-sidebands is obtained with a tickling field strength that was empirically optimized to \u03c91/(2\u03c0)\u02dc900 Hz.",
                        "FIG. 11 shows spectra of the strongly-coupled AB system of 2,3,6-trichlorophenol superimposed with a solvent peak marked with an asterisk.",
                        "In contrast to the AX system of FIG. 10, some tickling sidebands are clearly visible in the strongly coupled AB system of FIG. 11. This undesirable effect was highlighted in the numerical simulations of FIG. 7.",
                        "Nevertheless, a reasonable decoupling efficiency is achieved. A lower rf-field amplitude must be used for smaller differences in chemical shifts. Tickling also works if the molecule comprises magnetically-equivalent spins, as in the A2M2X3 system ofpropan-1-ol (HOCH2CH2CH3).",
                        "The conventional spectrum and the tickling spectra with carrier frequencies set on one of the three multiplets are shown in FIG. 12. If the carrier frequency is set on the chemical shift of A2, the multiplicity of the coupling partner M2 is simplified by decoupling of the 3JAM, though the fine structure due to the 3JMX is not affected, as shown in the inset. If the carrier frequency is set on the chemical shift of X3, the multiplicity of the coupling partner M2 is simplified by decoupling of 3JXM but the fine structure (triplet) due to 3JAM remains, as shown in the inset of FIG. 12 c. Clearly tickling can decouple all J-interactions between the irradiated spin and its J-coupling partners. Obviously, tickling does not affect couplings between spins that are not irradiated. In FIG. 12 d, the carrier frequency was set on the M2 resonance of the A2M2X3 system. Since the M2 spins are coupled to both A2 and X3, while 3JAX=0, all three resonances appear decoupled in this case. These results show that the presence of magnetically-equivalent spins does not compromise the performance of tickling experiments. Furthermore, in all three samples considered, we did not observe any anomalies of the integrals in the tickling spectra.",
                        "It is well known that the effective frequency of the centreband of a comb C of pulses can be shifted at will from the carrier frequency vrf to v=vrf+\u03c6/(2\u03c0\u0394t) by advancing the phase of the kth pulse of the comb C in the kth dwell time \u0394t through a shift k\u0394\u03c6. Such phase modulation schemes have been used in conjunction with so-called \u2018delays alternating with nutation for tailored excitation\u2019 (DANTE).[31-34] Since the position within the interval \u0394t of the tickling pulses of duration \u03c4p belonging to any one comb C is immaterial, one can readily superimpose several combs Cm of tickling pulses with m=1, 2, . . . M, each of which may be associated with its own phase shift k\u0394\u03c6m and hence its own frequency shift. Each dwell time \u0394t does contain only one tickling pulse per comb. The tickling pulses within a dwell time \u0394t which belong to different combs Cm do not need to be equidistant. This allows one in effect to irradiate simultaneously at a manifold of frequencies, as shown in the simulations of FIG. 13.",
                        "The method is effective over a broad range of chemical shifts. Groups of magnetically equivalent spins as occur in methylene and methyl groups can be decoupled efficiently. A considerable gain in resolution and spectral simplification can thus be obtained without distortion of signal integrals. We believe that this new experimental tool can aid the characterization of complex systems, including biological macromolecules. By inserting a manifold of polychromatic tickling pulses in each \u0394t interval, several subsystems can be decoupled simultaneously.",
                        "The new tickling method allows one to avoid interferences and allows irradiation at multiple frequencies to decouple several interactions simultaneously."
