    "title": "How to Tickle Spins with a Fourier Transform NMR Spectrometer",
    "date": "2012-12-23",
    "abstract": "In the long bygone days of continuous-wave nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a selected transition within a multiplet of a high-resolution spectrum could be irradiated by a highly selective continuous-wave (CW) radio-frequency (rf) field with a very weak amplitude \u03c9(2)/(2\u03c0)\u2264J. This causes splittings of connected transitions, allowing one to map the connectivities of all transitions within the energy-level diagram of the spin system. Such tickling experiments stimulated the invention of two-dimensional spectroscopy, but seem to have been forgotten for nearly 50 years. We show that tickling can readily be achieved in homonuclear systems with Fourier transform spectrometers by applying short pulses in the intervals between the sampling points. Extensions to heteronuclear systems are even more straightforward since they can be carried out using very weak CW rf fields.",

                "Simultaneous decoupling of a manifold of homonuclear scalar interactions in high-resolution NMR spectra can be achieved by applying short phase-shifted radiofrequency (rf) pulses during the observation of the free induction decays. Simultaneous decoupling of multiple resonances allows the measurement of remaining J-couplings normally hidden by overlapping signals.",
                "Decoupling is a well-known tool to simplify NMR spectra, gain resolution, and identify chemical shifts and J-couplings in solution. Although heteronuclear decoupling (e.g., irradiating 1 H while observing 13 C) is a routine operation, homonuclear decoupling (e.g., acquiring a 1 H decoupled 1 H spectrum) remains a challenge, because the Larmor frequencies of coupled spins can be very close. First attempts to achieve homonuclear decoupling are older than Fourier transform (FT) NMR spectroscopy and employ continuous-wave (CW) double resonance. [1] An alternative method is Jresolved two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy, in which a skew projection generates a broadband homonuclear decoupled spectrum. [2] The disadvantage of most methods that achieve broadband decoupling in the indirect dimension of 2D spectra is low sensitivity and intensity distortions. [3] Homonuclear decoupling within a defined bandwidth can be achieved by using shaped inversion pulses. [4] Multiple regions can be irradiated simultaneously with several interleaved sequences in the manner of delays alternating with nutation for tailored excitation (DANTE). [5] It is possible to acquire a signal in real time while one or several homonuclear scalar interactions are removed selectively. Our method is related to an early technique known as homonuclear decoupling (HD) that is still in use, and in which the dwell time is shared between gated CW irradiation and the recording of the signal. [6] A modification uses a string of shaped inversion pulses. [4,7] In these methods, the irradiated signal disappears, and all couplings to the spin that is saturated by the rf irradiation are cancelled. The method proposed by Jesson et al. [6] uses an initial excitation pulse followed by bursts of CW irradiation, all with the same phase. In our experiment, as shown in Figure 1, only brief rf pulses with a flip angle b 18 are applied in each dwell time. By setting the phases to be initially perpendicular, analogous to the modification of Meiboom and Gill for spin-echo trains, [8] the on-resonance spin is in effect selectively spin locked and hence decoupled, and a narrow singlet is observed at the irradiation frequency. The decoupling effect can be rationalized in terms of average Hamiltonian theory (AHT). [9] By setting to zero the differences between the frequencies of the two parallel single-quantum (SQ) transitions associated with each spin, the following decoupling condition can be found:",
                "By choosing the average rf field strength hw 1 i to match the coupling constant J AX , the splitting vanishes. The obser-  vation is stroboscopic and occurs at multiples of the dwell time Dt. We propose to keep the duty cycle t p /Dt as small as possible, so that several pulses m = 1, 2, \u2026, M can be accommodated in each dwell time Dt with different effective frequencies n m . The decoupling effect can be described as a manifestation of stabilization by interconversion within a triad of coherences under multiple refocusing (SITCOM). [10] In a two-spin system without irradiation, the J-coupling normally converts an initial in-phase term I x into an antiphase term 2 I y S z during free evolution. But if decoupling pulses are inserted, a third operator, the longitudinal two-spin order 2 I z S z , comes into play to complete the triad. The partial conversion of 2 I y S z into 2 I z S z hinders the buildup of the former and thus stabilizes the initial I x term.",
                "Figure 2 shows a simulation of the time dependence of these three product operators and of their norm. Because the norm is constant, coherence transfer must be confined to the subspace spanned by the triad of noncommuting operators. In the original SITCOM effect, a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) [8,11] sequence with moderate rf amplitudes generated 2 I y S y as a third term of the triad, leading to the stabilization of I x . Decoupling experiments with one pulse per dwell time at a single effective frequency n 1 were applied to the A 2 M 2 X 3 system of propan-1-ol (HOCH 2 CH 2 CH 3 ). The conventional spectrum and three decoupled spectra with carrier frequencies set on one of the three multiplets are shown in Figure 3. The decoupling pulse length was t p = 1 ms for a dwell time Dt = 100 ms. The peakfield strength was w 1 /(2p) % 1.6 kHz in all cases, corresponding to a flip angle of b = w 1 t p % 0.68. If the carrier frequency is set on the chemical shift W(A 2 ), the multiplicity of the coupling partner M 2 is simplified by decoupling 3 J AM , where-as the fine structure due to 3 J MX is not affected, as shown in the inset of Figure 3. If the carrier frequency is set on W(X 3 ), the multiplicity of the coupling partner M 2 is simplified by decoupling 3 J XM , but the triplet due to 3 J AM remains (inset Figure 3 c.) Clearly, our sequence can decouple all interactions between the irradiated spin and its J-coupled partners, but does not affect couplings between spins that are not irradiated. In Figure 3 d, the carrier frequency was set on the central M 2 resonance of the A 2 M 2 X 3 system. Because the M 2 spins are coupled to both A 2 and X 3 when (purple/dashed-dotted line) is conserved. Upon Fourier transformation, the shallow amplitude modulation of the expectation value hI x i gives rise to weak sidebands. The simulations were performed with mPackages. [14] Figure 3 ). The peak rf field strength was w 1 /(2p) % 1.6 kHz in all cases. This corresponds to an average rf field strength of hw 1 i/(2p) % 16 Hz. All spectra were processed with 1 Hz line broadening except for the expansions shown in the insets, for which no line broadening was used.",
                "3 J AX = 0, all three resonances are decoupled in this case. Our decoupling scheme also works for strongly coupled systems, although sidebands become more prominent. This is shown by simulations and experimental data in the Supporting Information.",
                "It is known that the effective frequency n m of a comb C m of pulses can be shifted at will from the common carrier frequency n rf by a frequency shift Dn m = n m \u00c0n rf = Df m /A C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (2pDt) by shifting the phase of the k th pulse of comb C m through kDf m . [4][5]12] Because the position within the dwell time Dt of the pulses belonging to any one comb C m is immaterial, one can readily interleave several combs with m = 1, 2, \u2026, M. This allows in effect to irradiate simultaneously at a manifold of frequencies n m with m = 1, 2, \u2026, M. Polychromatic decoupling can be a valuable tool to identify and measure J-couplings that are hidden by other signals. An example is given by the 1 H spectra of the cyclic peptide cyclosporine A in Figure 4. From a) to e), up to four H N multiplets are decoupled simultaneously by means of M = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 interleaved combs of decoupling pulses, the phases of which are incremented to match the desired offsets (dashed arrows). On the right-hand side of Figure 4, the coupling partners H a show multiplicities that are simplified, because up to four JA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G (H a , H N ) interactions are decoupled simultaneously. The stepwise simplifications are highlighted by dashed red rectangles. The residual multiplets that are caused by",
                "couplings can be easily determined, thus, revealing previously hidden information. The number M of effective frequencies is limited only by the total duty cycle. Our technique can be implemented in the detection or evolution periods of any multidimensional experiment to selectively decouple multiple interactions. Trains of pulses with moderate rf strength can be combined with spin-echo sequences to measure transverse relaxation rates R 2 = 1/T 2 in homonuclear coupled spin systems. [13] In summary, we have presented a new polychromatic homoA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G nuclear decoupling sequence that is compatible with periodic signal acquisition as in normal Fourier transform spectroscopy. By inserting a manifold of polychromatic pulses in each dwell time Dt, several subsystems can be decoupled simultaneously. A considerable gain in resolution and spectral simplification can thus be obtained without distortion of signal integrals. We believe that this can help to characterize complex systems, including biological macromolecules. We would like to refer to our method as \"window-acquired spin-tailoring experiment\" (WASTE)."

                "All spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance I spectrometer equipped with an 11.4 T magnet (500 MHz for protons) and a triple-resonance cryoA C H T U N G T R E N N U N G probe. All measurements were performed at 300 K. Typical 908 pulse lengths were about 7 ms, corresponding to an rf field strength of w 1 /(2p) % 36 kHz. The decoupling pulses usually had a duration t p = 1 ms, and rf field strengths 0.2 < w 1 /(2p) < 1.6 kHz, corresponding to flip angles smaller than 18 in all cases. The spectral widths were typically 10 kHz, so that the dwell times were Dt = 100 ms, and the duty cycles 1 % for monochromatic and 4 % for the tetrachromatic experiments of Figure 4. Two scans were acquired for each experiment with a two-step phase alternation of the initial pulse, in concert with the receiver phase. Typically, 32 k points were acquired for each spectrum. All spectra were processed with a line broadening of 1 Hz, except when specified."
