    "title": "An engineered high affinity Fbs1 carbohydrate binding protein for selective capture of N-glycans and N-glycopeptides",
    "date": "2017-05-23",
    "abstract": "A method for selective and comprehensive enrichment of N-linked glycopeptides was developed to facilitate detection of micro-heterogeneity of N-glycosylation. The method takes advantage of the inherent properties of Fbs1, which functions within the ubiquitin-mediated degradation system to recognize the common core pentasaccharide motif (Man3GlcNAc2) of N-linked glycoproteins. We show that Fbs1 is able to bind diverse types of N-linked glycomolecules; however, wild-type Fbs1 preferentially binds high-mannose-containing glycans. We identified Fbs1 variants through mutagenesis and plasmid display selection, which possess higher affinity and improved recovery of complex N-glycomolecules. In particular, we demonstrate that the Fbs1 GYR variant may be employed for substantially unbiased enrichment of N-linked glycopeptides from human serum. Most importantly, this highly efficient N-glycopeptide enrichment method enables the simultaneous determination of N-glycan composition and N-glycosites with a deeper coverage (compared to lectin enrichment) and improves large-scale N-glycoproteomics studies due to greatly reduced sample complexity.",

                        "Fbs1 specifically binds to the common pentasaccharide core motif (M3N2) of N-glycans3134. With an aim of developing an N-linked glycopeptide enrichment method, we examined the ability of wt Fbs1 to bind to a variety of glycomolecules. The human Fbs1 sugar-binding domain (residues 92\u2013296, hereafter referred as Fbs1) was expressed as a fusion to the C-terminus of the SNAP tag to facilitate its immobilization to beads35. The SNAP tag protein is a mutated human DNA repair enzyme with an active site cysteine that forms a covalent linkage to benzyl guanine functional groups presented on agarose beads (BG beads). The SNAP-Fbs1 fusion protein was expressed in NEB Express Escherichia coli cells and highly efficient immobilization was accomplished by incubating purified SNAP-Fbs1 proteins with BG beads (see Methods section and Supplementary Fig. 1). This preparation of immobilized SNAP-Fbs1 is referred to as \u2018Fbs1 beads'. In Fig. 1a, the affinity of Fbs1 for high-mannose N-glycans is shown via a pulldown assay using Fbs1 beads to capture RNase B, a protein that contains a single site modified by a variety of high-mannose N-glycans (Fig. 1a, Lane 3). Lane 2 shows that binding to RNase B is entirely dependent on the presence of N-glycan since PNGase F treatment removes the N-glycans and abolishes binding. In addition to high-mannose N-glycoproteins, we demonstrate that Fbs1 also binds to glycoproteins with complex N-glycans. Figure 1b shows that human IgG-containing complex N-glycans is also efficiently captured using Fbs1 beads. Importantly, only the N-glycosylated heavy chain is bound (Fig. 1b, Lane 4) and treatment with PNGase F indicates that binding is N-glycan dependent (Fig. 1b, Lane 3).",
                        "The interaction of Fbs1 with N-glycopeptides and free N-glycans was evaluated by isothermal calorimetric measurement (ITC). Figure 1c illustrates that Fbs1 is capable of binding to SGP, a naturally occurring glycopeptide consisting of a six amino acid peptide (KVANKT) and a bi-antennary complex N-glycan with terminal sialic acid residues (structure shown in Fig. 1c, left panel). The affinity of Fbs1 for SGP is 3.0\u00b10.12\u2009\u03bcM, a measurement consistent with the findings of Hagihara et al.34 who analysed Fbs1 binding to a similar sialylated substrate and arrived at a Ka=0.24 \u00d7 10\u22125\u2009M\u22121 (equivalent to Kd=4.2\u2009\u03bcM). These two independent analyses confirm that the presence of sialic acid negatively affects Fbs1 binding relative to high-mannose substrates where Kd measurements range from 0.24 to 0.30\u2009\u03bcM34. Thus wt Fbs1 has an inherent bias against binding sialylated glycans.",
                        "In mammals, N-glycan structures may also include the heterogeneous presence of \u03b11,6-linked fucose on the innermost GlcNAc residue of the N-glycan pentasaccharide core. ITC experiments using defined glycan substrates M3N2 and M3N2F (differing only in the presence or absence of core \u03b11,6-linked fucose) (Fig. 1c, left panel) revealed that Fbs1 is able to bind to both substrates with equal affinity (Kd: 0.12 versus 0.13\u2009\u03bcM, respectively; Fig. 1c). Therefore, \u03b11-6 fucosylation of the N-glycan pentasaccharide core has no effect on Fbs1 binding.",
                        "To investigate the basis for the different Kd values for SGP versus M3N2, we performed an exoglycosidase trimming experiment. First, the lysine side chains of SGP were fluorescently labelled with tetramethylrhodamine (designated as SGP-TMR) to permit measurement of the relative concentrations of bound versus unbound substrate. Then the glycan residues in SGP-TMR (sialic acid, galactose and GlcNAc) were sequentially removed from the non-reducing end to produce a diverse set of N-glycopeptides (Fig. 1d, glycopeptides 1\u20134). Removal of sialic acid clearly improves recovery of the derivative glycopeptide. Furthermore, trimming to create a pentasaccharide core glycan resulted in at least a threefold improvement in recovery, a finding that is consistent with the significant difference in observed Kd values (Fig. 1d, right panel).",
                        "In typical N-glycan profiling studies, N-glycans are removed from a glycoprotein by PNGase F digestion after which liberated N-glycans are labelled with a fluorophore at their reducing end. The most commonly used fluorophore for such labelling is 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB). Thus we assessed whether the presence of 2-AB has an effect on N-glycan binding to Fbs1 beads. Supplementary Figure 2 shows that Fbs1 does not bind to M3N2-2-AB as the fluorescent signal associated with SNAP-Fbs1 beads is very low and similar to the signal associated with SNAP control beads. We reason that Fbs1 recognition of the terminal GlcNAc is abolished due to opening of the carbohydrate ring that occurs upon 2-AB labelling (Supplementary Fig. 2, structure b). However, this feature does not affect the application of Fbs1 for glycopeptide analysis since the enrichment step would be upstream of the optional 2-AB labelling step.",
                        "Considered together, these specificity studies demonstrate that Fbs1 is able to bind to both high-mannose and complex N-glycans regardless of core fucosylation. However, there is a significant reduction in binding of fully sialylated N-glycans, possibly due to their charge."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Since sialylated glycans are less efficiently captured by wt Fbs1, we tested various buffer conditions in an attempt to improve recovery of complex N-glycans. For this experiment, we again used SGP-TMR as a substrate. Figure 2a demonstrates that high-salt buffer significantly improves the affinity of wt Fbs1 for SGP-TMR. PNGase F treatment confirms that the binding to SGP-TMR is N-glycan dependent. Binding affinity increases as the salt concentration is increased to \u22651.5\u2009M (Supplementary Fig. 3). Figure 2b displays the results of a qualitative binding assay where equal amounts of RNase B and fetuin were each incubated with Fbs1 beads in low-salt versus high-salt buffers. RNase B contains single high-mannose N-linked glycans while fetuin contains sialylated complex N-linked glycans32. In low-salt buffer, wt Fbs1 beads pull down RNase B but almost no detectable amount of fetuin (Fig. 2b, Lane 2). However, in high-salt buffer, Fbs1 beads capture a significant amount of both fetuin and RNase B (Fig. 2b, Lane 3). This experiment shows that high ionic strength conditions enhance the binding of Fbs1 beads to sialylated complex N-glycans without negatively affecting the binding of high-mannose N-glycans. This finding is supported by a reciprocal experiment in which fetuin and RNase B were each immobilized to Affi-Gel beads and used to pull down soluble SNAP-Fbs1 (Fig. 2c). The data from this experiment show a marked increase in the affinity of Fbs1 for a complex N-linked glycoprotein in high-salt conditions (Fig. 2c, Lane 1 versus Lane 2). Furthermore, ITC experiments using high salt (2\u2009M NaCl) produced a Kd value=1.4\u2009\u03bcM\u00b10.04 for SGP, a significant reduction from the value (3.0\u00b10.12\u2009\u03bcM) obtained using 50\u2009mM NaCl.",
                        "The specific effect of ionic strength on binding sialylated N-glycans was further investigated by incubating Fbs1 beads with either SGP-TMR or SGP-TMR pretreated with \u03b12-3,6,8 neuraminidase to remove sialic acids to create asialo-SGP-TMR. Binding was compared in both high- (2\u2009M NaCl) and low-salt (50\u2009mM NaCl) buffers in a pulldown assay. High ionic strength conditions significantly improved recovery of the SGP-TMR substrate while recovery of the asialo derivative was highly efficient in low- and high-salt buffer (Fig. 2d). We conclude that sialic acids presented on complex N-glycans cause a significant reduction in binding to Fbs1-beads, but this bias can be overcome using a high ionic strength buffer."

                        "In addition to using high salt to overcome the inherent bias of Fbs1 against binding complex N-glycans, we sought to identify Fbs1 variants with unbiased N-glycan binding under low ionic strength conditions. A high-throughput selection method was established to isolate Fbs1 mutants with higher affinity to complex N-glycans. The method, outlined in Fig. 3a, was modelled after the plasmid display approach designed by Speight et al.36. In this method, the Fbs1 sugar-binding domain was fused to nuclear factor (NF)-\u03bab p50 protein, a transcription factor with especially high affinity for a 10-bp sequence (5\u2032-GGGAATTCCC-3\u2032) strategically located at two sites within the expression plasmid (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Accordingly, expressed p50-Fbs1 fusion proteins will stably bind to the 5\u2032-GGGAATTCCC-3\u2032 sequences and physically link the Fbs1 variants to the encoding plasmid DNA (shown in a gel mobility shift assay in Supplementary Fig. 4b). Supplementary Figure 4c shows the results of a pilot experiment where the complexes of p50-wt Fbs1 and the encoding plasmid DNA were incubated with either immobilized RNase B or fetuin. Much higher levels of plasmid were captured with RNase B beads, indicating that the plasmid display system can differentiate between high- and low-affinity Fbs1\u2013glycoprotein interactions.",
                        "Five amino acid clusters (Supplementary Fig. 5) within the glycan interaction surface of Fbs1 were subjected to saturation mutagenesis using randomized oligonucleotides. The mutated amino acids were chosen by analysis of the X-ray structures of mouse Fbs1 to identify amino acid substitutions that may affect recognition of the N-glycan pentasaccharide core. The five individual mutagenesis libraries were created within the context of a plasmid encoding a p50-Fbs1 fusion protein and then mixed in equal amounts (combined library complexity >1 \u00d7 106) before performing plasmid display selection to isolate binding-competent Fbs1 variants. The plasmid library was used to transform E. coli NEB5-alpha cells that were grown to allow for expression of the p50-Fbs1 variants. After gentle lysis of the host cells, the displayed Fbs1 variants were incubated with fetuin beads. After extensive washing, the DNA\u2013protein complexes were eluted from the fetuin beads, and the isolated plasmid was again used to transform E. coli cells. This enrichment procedure for high-affinity Fbs1 variants was repeated for a total of five cycles. The plasmid display results (summarized in Supplementary Fig. 5c) provided valuable information regarding amino acid substitutions that have potential to improve Fbs1 affinity to complex N-glycans. In fact, when the most commonly identified substitutions (Fig. 3b) were transferred to SNAP-Fbs1, pulldown assays reinforced the findings of the plasmid display selection process. In Fig. 3c, variants PPG, PPS, PPR (at positions 154\u2013156) and the YR variant (F173Y/E174R) all outperformed wt Fbs1 for fetuin bead pulldown.",
                        "In addition, we performed site-directed alanine scanning to identify individual side chains that may directly influence glycan binding. Mizushima et al.3738 previously reported that Man(IV) of RNase B forms a hydrogen bond with the sidechain N\u03b4 atom of Asn-159 of mouse Fbs1. Thus we mutated the equivalent residue in human Fbs1 (Ser-155) and expected a negative impact on glycan-binding affinity. Strikingly, the S155A mutant displayed a 1.5-fold increase in pulldown of fetuin (Fig. 3c). Subsequently, position S155 was substituted with glycine (S155G) and this variant displayed a twofold increase in fetuin recovery (Fig. 3c,d). Thus the hydrogen-bonding pattern observed by X-ray crystallography does not appear critical for complex N-linked glycan binding (the affinity of S155G for RNase B was not affected, Supplementary Fig. 6). Other residues predicted to form direct contact to the RNase B glycan were mutated to alanine (human Asp154, Asp212 and Lys280) and two of the substitutions negatively affected substrate binding (Supplementary Fig. 7).",
                        "Combinatorial mutants were created using information gained from the plasmid display selection as well as the site-directed mutagenesis studies (see Fig. 3b). Overall, the PPRYR (combination of PPR and YR) and GYR (combination of S155G, F173Y and E174R) variants displayed the greatest affinity to fetuin beads (pulldown amount was at least 3.5-fold greater than wt Fbs1; Fig. 3d, Lanes 4 and 5)."

                        "The best performing Fbs1 variants were further investigated for glycan-binding specificity. First, the fetuin:RNase B competition binding assay described in Fig. 2b was repeated using equal amounts of wt Fbs1, Fbs1 GYR (henceforth, GYR) and Fbs1 PPRYR (henceforth, PPRYR) beads (Supplementary Fig. 1) in both low- and high-salt buffers. Figure 4a shows SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) results where, remarkably, the GYR and PPRYR variants display no apparent bias for binding to fetuin or RNase B in low-salt buffer (Lanes 2 and 3, compared to Lane 7, in Fig. 4a). The PPRYR variant shows a slight reduction in binding to RNase B (Supplementary Fig. 6) and the PPRYR variant is also prone to aggregation during cellular overexpression and conjugation to the BG beads. For example, the asterisk in Fig. 4a indicates significant leaching of the PPRYR mutant from the beads, demonstrating that not all of the bead-associated material is covalently linked. In comparison, the GYR mutant behaved better during expression and conjugation to beads. Thus the GYR mutant was selected for further characterization.",
                        "Figure 4b further demonstrates the superior performance of the GYR variant. The GYR variant was tested for binding to SGP-TMR and three glycopeptide derivatives created by enzymatic trimming. The data from Fig. 1d were reproduced within Fig. 4b to directly compare the binding profiles of wt Fbs1 versus the GYR variant. The affinity of the GYR variant for all four glycopeptide species is very similar (recovery percentage ranged from 47% to 60%, Fig. 4b, black columns), whereas wt Fbs1 displays an obvious bias in capture of the different glycopeptides (Fig. 1d or Fig. 4b, white columns). Importantly, the GYR variant enables highly efficient N-glycopeptide recovery and binding to diverse types of N-glycans is substantially unbiased."

RNase B tryptic peptides were generated and spiked with SGP and SGP-TMR to simulate a complex sample. Trypsin-treated RNaseB contains non-glycosylated peptides and multiple species of high-mannose N-linked glycopeptides (major species labelled as: M5N2-NLTK and M6N2-NLTK). The desired result was equivalent enrichment of each type of N-glycopeptide (sialylated versus high mannose) without contamination with non-glycosylated peptides. Figure 5 shows a total ion chromatograph of the liquid chromatography (LC)-MS-based analysis. The black line is the chromatogram of the input mixture without enrichment. The orange line is the chromatogram of the Fbs1 GYR enrichment sample and the blue line is the chromatogram of the wt Fbs1 enrichment sample. The glycomolecules elute between 24 and 30\u2009min, whereas the non-glycosylated peptides elute before 24\u2009min. Importantly, non-glycosylated peptides are not enriched by either wt Fbs1 or the GYR variant. The extracted ion chromatogram data (shown as a bar graph, Fig. 5) also shows that the GYR variant performs well for capturing high-mannose-containing glycopeptides M5N2-NLTK and M6N2-NLTK. Most importantly, enrichment of the sialylated glycan species is significantly improved by use of the GYR variant."

                        "We assessed N-glycopeptide enrichment from a biological sample using Fbs1 GYR. In this study, the N-glyco-FASP method243940 was employed. Tryptic peptides prepared from human serum albumin (HSA)-depleted human serum without enrichment (pre-enrichment) or with Fbs1 GYR enrichment were subjected to direct LC-MS analysis (Fig. 6a), N-glycan profiling analysis (Fig. 6b) and N-glycosite identification/deglycoproteomics10 using the PNGase F/18O water method2439 (Fig. 6c,d). Figure 6a shows the total ion chromatograph from the LC-MS analysis of pre-enrichment and Fbs1 GYR enrichment (Left panel). Approximately 14% of peptides were retained by Fbs1 GYR. When the peptides enriched by Fbs1 GYR were treated with active PNGase F to remove N-glycans, the overall peptide profile shifted to earlier retention time area in the HILIC LC due to the removal of hydrophilic N-glycans from the peptides. This suggests that a majority of the enriched peptides are N-glycopeptides. We also examined the recovery efficiency of N-glycopeptides in the Fbs1 GYR enrichment sample. We compared the 2-AB-labelled N-glycan profile from pre-enrichment and Fbs1 GYR enrichment samples. Although four small peaks (labelled with asterisk (*), corresponding to four bisecting N-glycans) were reduced in the Fbs1 GYR enrichment sample, Fig. 6b shows the two N-glycan profiles (peak pattern and peak height) are remarkably similar. These N-glycan profiles suggest Fbs1 GYR efficiently binds most N-glycans and thus recovers most of the N-glycopeptides from human serum samples.",
                        "Next we examined Fbs1 GYR enrichment in detail by N-glycosite identification or deglycoproteomics10 using PNGase F deglycosylation in the presence of 18O water, which tags the deglycosylated peptides with 2.988\u2009daltons due to conversion of asparagine (N) at the N-glycosylation site to aspartic acid (D) and incorporation of 18O. The peptide spectra with isotope tagging [+2.988] at N within the canonical N-glycosylation motif N-X-T/S can be confidently assigned as an N-glycopeptide2441. Although some N-glycosylations occur at non-N-X-T/S motifs42, we excluded the peptide spectra with an N[+2.988] tag at non-N-X-T/S motifs since these sites need further confirmation. Figure 6c and Supplementary Data 1 and 2 show Fbs1 GYR enrichment greatly increases the N-glycopeptide fraction in the samples (65.5% in Fbs1 GYR enrichment versus 8.5% in pre-enrichment), thus greatly reducing the sample complexity. This enabled the identification of many more unique N-glycosites. From the same amount of starting human serum tryptic peptides, 477 unique N-glycosites were identified after Fbs1 GYR enrichment, while only 183 unique N-glycosites were identified without Fbs1 GYR enrichment (pre-enrichment), of which 172 N-glycosites (94%) were also identified by Fbs1 GYR enrichment (Fig. 6d, left panel and Supplementary Data 1 and 2). The unique N-glycosites were assigned to 89 and 230 N-glycoproteins in pre-enrichment and Fbs1 GYR enrichment samples, respectively (Fig. 6d, right panel and Supplementary Data 1 and 2).

                        "We have shown above that Fbs1 GYR significantly improves N-glycosite identification (deglycoproteomics) from human serum. Each N-glycosite may contain a different population of N-glycan modifications (micro-heterogeneity), which can be predictive markers for disease states or specific biological function1013. Standard N-glycosite identification by PNGase F treatment in 18O water results in the loss of information pertaining to which N-glycans are present at each glycosite. Since Fbs1 GYR enrichment maintains the linkage of each N-glycan to each respective N-glycosite, and enrichment levels are >65%, our protocol allows simultaneous identification of the N-glycan diversity at a given N-glycosite. To demonstrate this, we applied Fbs1 GYR to enrich and identify intact N-glycopeptides from IgG-depleted human serum, which contains fewer glycomolecules compared to HSA-depleted human serum. We also compared Fbs1 GYR enrichment with lectin (ConA, WGA and RCA120 mixture) enrichment for intact N-glycopeptide identification. Tryptic peptides prepared from IgG-depleted human serum without enrichment (pre-, or pre-enrichment), with lectin enrichment, or with Fbs1 GYR enrichment were subjected to LC-MS/MS using the higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation method11. Intact N-glycopeptides were identified by using Byonic software to compare the HCD spectra against the human proteome database (uniprot human up000005640) and the 57 most common N-glycan structures in human plasma. Most importantly, Fbs1 GYR enrichment revealed more intact N-glycopeptides relative to lectin enrichment. With the same input of tryptic peptides (1\u2009\u03bcg peptides per MS run), an average of 2,142 N-glycopeptide spectra were identified after Fbs1 GYR enrichment, which is 2.2-fold more than the number (965) of N-glycopeptide spectra identified using lectin enrichment, and 7-fold more than the number (304) identified without enrichment (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Data 3\u20135). Following Fbs1 GYR enrichment 66% of total spectra were assigned to N-glycopeptides, while only 49% and 3.3% of spectra were assigned as N-glycopeptides in lectin enrichment and pre-enrichment samples, respectively (Fig. 7a). Combining all three MS runs, Fbs1 GYR enrichment enabled identification of 2,559 unique, intact N-glycopeptides, which is a 2.2-fold and 7-fold improvement over the unique peptides identified using lectin enrichment (1,172) and pre-enrichment (358), respectively (Fig. 7b). Fbs1 GYR enrichment also identified 478 unique N-glycosites, compared to 343 following lectin enrichment, and 224 unique N-glycosites in the pre-enrichment sample (Fig. 7b). Our data demonstrate that Fbs1 GYR enrichment can greatly improve identification of micro-heterogeneity of N-glycosylation, which can be indexed as the average number of glycan types per glycosite (number of unique N-glycopeptides/number of unique N-glycosites) and the average number of spectral counts per glycosite (number of spectral counts/number of unique N-glycosites). Figure 7c shows that Fbs1 GYR enrichment results in an average of 5.4 glycan types per N-glycosite and 13.4 spectral counts per N-glycosite, a 3.3-fold improvement over the values before enrichment. Additionally, lectin enrichment only provides a two-fold improvement versus pre-enrichment in the micro-heterogeneity analysis (Fig. 7c). Figure 7d shows the N-glycosylation micro-heterogeneity analysis for a single potential disease biomarker, human Complement C343. In this case, Fbs1 GYR enrichment clearly allows identification of more glycan types and spectra at each glycosite relative to the pre-enrichment and lectin enrichment samples. The complete data set from the N-glycosylation micro-heterogeneity analysis is presented in Supplementary Data 6. Overall, this experiment demonstrates that Fbs1 GYR enrichment enables more effective intact N-glycopeptide analysis with greatly expanded coverage and reveals a deeper analysis of micro-heterogeneity of N-glycosylation."

                "The human glycoproteome is rapidly emerging as an attractive reservoir of potential biomarkers of both health and disease4445. The plasma glycoproteome, in particular, is a valuable source for biomarkers so one may envisage rapid blood tests for early disease detection46. In order to achieve this goal, researchers are developing highly sophisticated LC/MS methods to characterize the diverse types of glycan modifications121547484950. Even as the data set grows, accurate determination of glycan composition and the associated glycosylation sites remains challenging51. Effective enrichment procedures are critically important to permit accurate, comprehensive analysis of the glycopeptide profile of patient samples.",
                "In the present study, we developed a novel strategy for selective isolation of N-linked glycopeptides en masse from complex peptide mixtures or biological samples. We made use of the glycan-binding properties of Fbs1, a eukaryotic lectin-like protein that normally functions in a ubiquitin-mediated process to eliminate misfolded N-glycosylated proteins. Fbs1 binds a Man3GlcNAc2 pentasaccharide that is common to all mammalian N-glycan species. Specifically, we show that an immobilized form of Fbs1 is able to bind to both high-mannose and complex N-glycans regardless of the presence or absence of \u03b11,6-linked fucose attached to the innermost GlcNAc residue. In low ionic strength buffer, Fbs1 preferentially binds to high-mannose N-glycans over sialylated complex N-glycans. However, we showed two approaches to mitigate this bias. First, wt Fbs1 binding to sialylated complex N-glycans was greatly improved in a high ionic strength buffer. Second, we isolated mutant forms of Fbs1 that bind to both complex N-glycans and high-mannose N-glycans with similar efficiency. The best performing Fbs1 variant contains the following amino acid substitutions: S155G, F173Y, and E174R. At position 155, we first discovered that a smaller side chain (alanine) resulted in greater fetuin pulldown (Fig. 3c). Then further mutagenesis to glycine resulted in even higher affinity to complex N-glycans, most likely due to removal of steric hindrance. The subtle change from phenylalanine to tyrosine is more difficult to explain. We speculate that the addition of a single hydroxyl group may positively affect sugar ring binding. Finally, the E174R charge reversal substitution is theoretically important for improved recognition of negatively charged sialic acid residues.",
                "Over the past 15 years, other important technologies have been developed for glycomolecule enrichment. Most are based on the hydrophilic properties of the sugar residues comprising both N- and O-linked modifications. Unfortunately, these methods may enrich other types of biomolecules. Methods specific for sialic acid capture also do not discriminate between N- and O-linked modifications15. PNGase F specifically liberates N-glycans for accurate identification and if the hydrolysis reaction is conducted in the presence of 18O water the site of protein attachment will be distinctly labelled (Asn to Asp-18O). But information pertaining to the glycan composition at that site is lost upon hydrolysis. Our objective was to develop a method for unbiased N-glycopeptide enrichment that allows for simultaneous determination of glycan composition and the protein attachment site. Rather than utilize a chemical approach, we looked to nature for a protein with desirable properties. Lectins have been employed for many years for glycomolecule characterization and/or isolation. Yet no single lectin has been exploited for selective enrichment of N-linked glycopeptides.",
                "The inherent properties of Fbs1 are attractive and these properties were improved through a focussed protein engineering approach. Several protein display technologies were considered for the evolution of Fbs1 (ref. 52). In our hands, plasmid display worked extremely well for the identification of high-affinity-binding proteins. Five cycles of panning against immobilized fetuin were accomplished in 5 days, and the information from the selected mutants resulted in discovery of higher-binding-affinity variants of human Fbs1. Thus we recommend this method as an alternative to M13 phage display or cell-surface display technologies since not all proteins are amenable to membrane translocation or the folding environment of the secretory pathway. With plasmid display, expression of the protein library occurs in the E. coli cytoplasm. Cellular expression of the library proteins is combined with in vitro selection against an immobilized glycan substrate all the while maintaining the genotype:phenotype linkage necessary for a high-throughput method. We envisage that plasmid display will be a valuable approach for the evolution of other carbohydrate-binding proteins.",
                "Many important biological activities are affected by protein glycosylation, including protein folding, protein metabolism, protein\u2013protein interactions, immune cell recognition and intercellular signaling. Given the emerging interest in glycoproteins as biomarkers, a need exists for readily isolating and characterizing low-abundance glycoproteins from complex biological samples. The following features facilitate the application of the GYR variant in a simple workflow for N-glycopeptide enrichment: (1) the SNAP fusion partner enables rapid, efficient immobilization; (2) alternatively, the SNAP-Fbs1 fusion protein can also be employed in an N-glyco-FASP protocol; (3) N-glycopeptide capture may be accomplished in many buffer conditions, preferably a volatile low-salt buffer such as 50\u2009mM ammonium acetate or ammonium bicarbonate; (4) enriched N-glycopeptides may be eluted in 50% acetonitrile or 50% formic acid and directly analysed by MS; and (5) substantially unbiased capture of intact N-glycopeptides (rather than liberated N-glycans or deglycosylated peptides) allows for simultaneous identification of N-glycan composition and the respective glycosite.",
                "In both deglycoproteomic (Fig. 6) and glycoproteomic (Fig. 7) studies, N-glycopeptide abundance in the human serum samples was increased to 66% after Fbs1 GYR enrichment. This complexity reduction allows for more effective sample analysis during MS, which will improve large-scale glycoproteomic studies. The N-glycan profile from Fig. 6b indicates that Fbs1 GYR can capture most of the N-glycans in serum with similar efficiency. However, there is one apparent limitation for Fbs1 enrichment. N-glycan profiles shown in Fig. 6b suggest that Fbs1 GYR has a low affinity for bisecting N-glycans. According to the Fbs1 X-ray structure3738, the presence of a single bisecting GlcNAc residue may create a steric hindrance for Fbs1 binding.",
                "N-glycomolecule enrichment is routinely accomplished by HILIC, chemical methods or by capture with lectins. For example, the specific mixture of ConA, WGA and RCA120 lectins has been applied with success to enrich for N-glycan containing peptides24. Therefore, we directly compared Fbs1 GYR to this lectin mixture and found that the engineered, recombinant Fbs1 protein outperformed this mixture of non-recombinant proteins (Fig. 7). Alternatively, HILIC enrichment may be used for glycoproteomic studies, but it is more commonly applied for glycan profiling. Notably, HILIC enrichment is not specific for N-glycans and N-glycopeptide enrichment to only 30% has been achieved previously53. For intact N-glycopeptide identification, HILIC requires an additional chromatography step to achieve sufficient enrichment1819. Hydrazide-based methods can improve N-glycopeptide abundance to 80\u201390% (refs 14, 53), but this either results in the loss of N-glycan information1214 or only sialyated glycans may be captured15. Fbs1 enrichment improves N-glycopeptide abundance to 66% in a specific and non-destructive manner. This substantially unbiased and highly efficient N-glycopeptide enrichment method enables the simultaneous determination of N-glycan composition and N-glycosites with a deeper coverage (compared to lectin enrichment) and allows large-scale N-glycoproteomic studies due to greatly reduced sample complexity. In conclusion, we propose that the Fbs1 GYR variant may be the centrepiece of analysis methods requiring selective N-glycomolecule enrichment."

In brief, N-glycans released from N-glycopeptides using PNGase F were purified using Ultralink hydrazide resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The N-glycans were then labelled with 2-AB (Sigma) and extracted using HyperSep Diol SPE cartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each step was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2-AB derivatized N-glycans were then separated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with fluorescence detection on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC H-Class instrument consisting of a binary solvent manager, sample manager and fluorescence detector under the control of Empower 3 chromatography workstation software (Waters, Milford, MA). Glycans were separated using a Waters Ethylene Bridged Hybrid (BEH) Glycan column, (130A, 1.7\u2009\u03bcm, 2.1\u2009mm \u00d7 150\u2009mm, Part no. 186004742) with 50\u2009mM ammonium formate pH 4.4, as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B.
