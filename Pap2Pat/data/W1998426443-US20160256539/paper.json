    "title": "HIV-1 Env DNA Vaccine plus Protein Boost Delivered by EP Expands B- and T-Cell Responses and Neutralizing Phenotype In Vivo",
    "date": "2013-12-31",
    "abstract": "An effective HIV vaccine will most likely require the induction of strong T-cell responses, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), and the elicitation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Previously, we demonstrated the induction of strong HIV/SIV cellular immune responses in macaques and humans using synthetic consensus DNA immunogens delivered via adaptive electroporation (EP). However, the ability of this improved DNA approach to prime for relevant antibody responses has not been previously studied. Here, we investigate the immunogenicity of consensus DNA constructs encoding gp140 sequences from HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C and D in a DNA prime-protein boost vaccine regimen. Mice and guinea pigs were primed with single- and multi-clade DNA via EP and boosted with recombinant gp120 protein. Sera were analyzed for gp120 binding and induction of neutralizing antibody activity. Immunization with recombinant Env protein alone induced low-titer binding antibodies with limited neutralization breath. In contrast, the synthetic DNA prime-protein boost protocol induced significantly higher antibody binding titers. Furthermore, sera from DNA prime-protein boost groups were able to neutralize a broader range of viruses in a panel of tier 1 clade B viruses as well as multiple tier 1 clade A and clade C viruses. Further investigation of synthetic DNA prime plus adaptive EP plus protein boost appears warranted.",

                "There is an urgent need for improved vaccination approaches against HIV that induce improved humoral and cellular immune responses [1]\u2013[4]. It is generally agreed upon that strong T-cell responses and breath in neutralizing antibodies will likely play a role in the development of a protective vaccine [1], [4]\u2013[6]. Though DNA platforms in the past have been poor inducers of seroconversion [7], [8], recent improvements in construct design, improved delivery, and improved formulations have enhanced the immune potency of this approach [7], [9]\u2013[11]. We have recently reported the induction of strong HIV/SIV-specific cellular immune responses in mice, macaques and humans using consensus DNA immunogens delivered via electroporation (EP) [7], [9], [12]\u2013[15]. While these studies have confirmed the induction of a potent and broad cell-mediated response, the ability of this improved DNA-EP platform to induce or prime for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is unknown. Due to a heightened interest in trying to improve immune responses to HIV included by DNA prime-protein boost vaccination strategies, here we studied this combination focused on increasing binding titers and neutralization capacity in vivo [2], [3], [16].",
                "In this study, we examined the immunogenicity of a synthetic consensus DNA vaccine encoding gp140 constructs derived from individual HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C and D in a DNA prime-protein boost regimen. These consensus DNA constructs were optimized using the following plasmid-enhancement techniques: codon optimization, RNA optimization, leader sequence addition, plasmid production at high concentrations and the DNA was delivered by adaptive EP as previously described [13], [14], [17]\u2013[20]. The DNA prime was followed by a protein boost with recombinant HIV gp120. Immune responses were measured by ELISA, B-cell ELISpot, T-cell ELISpot, and in a TZM-Bl neutralization assay. The combination approach increased T cell and antibody functionality over these observed with either independent modality."

Therefore, we characterized Ag-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses by simultaneous measurement of both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 secretion following peptide stimulation as described in Materials and Methods. We further analyzed the phenotype of the adaptive immune response elicited in multi-clade DNA+protein immunization groups by polychromatic flow cytometry, using FACS- based ICS, we evaluated IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 after in vitro stimulation with HIV-1 Env peptide pools that covered the entire Env sequence. Our gating strategy for intracellular cytokine flow cytometric analysis is depicted in Figure 4A; this strategy allowed us to separate CD8+ or CD4+ T cells into subsets based on their ability to produce one or more cytokines. As shown in Figure 4B & C a multi-clade DNA prime and protein boost induced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3/IL-2 secretion in CD8+/CD4+ T-cells. We observed that the percentage of Env-specific IFN-\u03b3+ -secreting CD8+ T-cells was greater as that of IL-2+ secreting CD4+ T-cells, suggesting the induction of a more dominant CD8+ T-cell response observed in multi-clade vaccine. Another effect of the DNA prime-protein boost strategy was an increase in the CD8+/IFN-\u03b3+ and CD4+/IL-2+ T-cell populations as compared to the CD8+/IL-2+ and CD4+/IFN-\u03b3+ populations. Consistent with the results observed in the IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot, the combined DNA prime-protein boost generated more robust Env-specific T-cell responses. This result supports the conclusion that optimized DNA, in combination with EP delivery and vaccination with a protein boost, is able to induce expansion of functional Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells."

                        "Next, we wanted to test whether immunization with multiple Env variants induced higher titers of antibodies than immunization with any single construct alone. We measured the levels of Env-specific IgG production using pooled serum from the groups of mice by binding ELISA to HIV-1 Env. Surprisingly, DNA alone elicited higher antibody binding titers than single recombinant protein alone. However, a DNA prime-protein boost induced more robust binding titers than either DNA or protein alone (Figure 5A). More importantly, the multi-clade immunization elicited higher titers than did immunization with any single Env variant alone (Figure 5B). Titers from the multi-clade immunization were further enhanced with the addition of a protein boost. These studies illustrate that an improved humoral response is generated with a multi-clade DNA prime followed by recombinant protein boost. Further, we also observed a positive correlation between antibody titer to T-cell responses measured by ELISpot in the multi-clade DNA prime followed by a recombinant protein boost immunization strategies (Figure 5C).",
                        "To further understand the mechanisms underlying antibody production, B-cell ELISpots were performed to measure the frequency of vaccine-induced antibody secreting cells (ASCs). As indicated in Figure 6A&B, we observed higher levels of HIV-1-specific IgG producing B-cells following a DNA prime than protein boost. Also these results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine combined with EP can activate a robust humoral response as measured by IgG production by B-cell ELISpot. The B-cell response was enhanced by approximately 50% with the inclusion of a recombinant protein boost. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that optimized DNA alone can induce a strong humoral response and the effect is further enhanced by the addition of a protein boost. Further, we also observed a positive correlation between antibody titer to B-cell ELISpot in the multi-clade DNA prime followed by a recombinant protein boost immunization strategies (Figure 6C)."

                        "Guinea pigs receiving the protein boost were then immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u03bcg of HIV-1 MN gp120 formulated Titermix X-Gold adjuvant\u00ae at weeks four and six. Guinea pigs allow for additional investigation of antibody responses since neutralization assays using TZM-Bl cells can be easily performed without the isolation of IgG as would be necessary in mouse serum. One week post final immunization, serum samples were measured for humoral immune responses. As seen in mice, the DNA prime-protein boost immunized guinea pigs exhibited the highest level of antibody responses as judged by binding ELISA. Similarly consistent with our mouse studies was the fact that multi-clade DNA alone resulted in superior levels of binding antibodies as compared to recombinant protein alone (Figure 7B&C).",
                        "To further characterize Env-specific responses induced in immunized guinea pigs, sera from multi-clade DNA prime and protein boost animals were tested for seroconversion using Western blot analysis to confirm specificity. Protein lysates were isolated from HIV-1 clade env transfected 293T cells and resolved using SDS-PAGE. Figure 8 shows that sera from multi clade Env-immunized plus protein boost bound to Env protein. Consistent with antibody analysis by ELISA, guinea pigs vaccinated with a multi-clade DNA vaccine plus protein boost exhibited a high level of cross reactivity with envelope proteins from different clades and demonstrate that the multi-clade DNA prime and protein boost vaccination procedure provided a technical platform to allow us to develop more effective HIV vaccines by using polyvalent Env formulations."

Guinea pigs sera were used because serum IgG does not need to be isolated as in mice for neutralization studies [45]. The serum neutralization titer was determined by assessing whether sera could neutralize 50% of the virus infection using the TZM-Bl cell assay system [37]. Sera were tested at in triplicate to test specificity.",

Out of the nine viruses from different clades that were tested, six viruses were neutralized with pooled sera from the multi-clade DNA vaccination and protein boost group. In contrast, vaccination with recombinant protein alone exhibited very limited neutralization breadth: sera from this group showed detectable neutralization titers for only few viruses out of the nine viruses tested. Recombinant protein vaccination also showed limited cross-clade breadth.",
                        "Similar to the results from binding titer assays, the magnitude of NAbs production was enhanced by a DNA prime-protein boost vaccination protocol. The addition of a recombinant protein boost enhanced the titers generated by DNA alone by half a log for many of the viruses. These data suggest that a multi-clade DNA prime is capable of generating improved neutralization breadth with lower titer and the magnitude of this response is enhanced by the addition of a recombinant protein boost without decreasing breadth. Overall, the DNA prime-protein boost regimen yielded superior results in all antibody assays."

                "The major limitation of DNA vaccination in the past has been its relatively weak immunogenicity in vivo. Recent DNA studies using in vivo EP have suggested that this new generation of DNA vaccine is more immune potent and this result for cellular response has been observed in humans [7], [9], [15]. Prior studies by our lab and others exploring the use of first generation HIV DNA vaccines showed that weak binding antibodies to Env could be elicited through DNA technology mostly in small animals [24], [41], [46]. Antibody responses were enhanced by boosting with monomeric gp120 protein, but the NAbs were of low potency and exhibited little cross-reactivity [47]. We sought to improve upon these results by introducing changes to our vaccine platform that would redirect the immune system towards a stronger humoral response. These changes included enhanced consensus DNA vaccines with the potential to induce antigen expression on the cell surface, improvements in transfection efficiency and antigen presentation via adaptive electroporation, and the addition of a recombinant protein boost to further stimulate B-cell expansion.",
                "The first DNA vaccines produced in the early 1990s were not able to induce reasonable levels of cell mediated immunity (CMI) in either non-human primates or humans [1], [4], [8], [16], [48], [49]. Through recent advances in DNA construct design and delivery methods, this approach now can produce strong CD8+ T-cell responses in these species [7], [10], [14], [19], [28], [50] and most importantly in two human clinical trails for HPV [9] and HIV strong T cell response [15] were induced in human by synthetic consensus optimized DNA delivered by adaptive EP. We followed up this encourage data in this prime boost studies presented here. We further characterized that vaccination with DNA plasmids encoding synthetic consensus envelope immunogens induce T-cell responses which are superior to protein alone. We also demonstrate that the most robust responses were achieved with a combined DNA prime-protein boost strategy, which particularly enhanced CD4 T-cell responses. When investigating the effects of a multi-clade DNA prime, we found that a combination of clades A, B, C and D improved T-cell responses as determined by both ELISpot and flow cytometry analyses (Figure 3 & 4). We considered the possibility that this phenomenon was the result of a dose effect since the total amount of DNA administrated to the multi-clade was 100 \u03bcg (25 \u03bcg of each clade) in comparison to 25 \u03bcg for the single-clade group. In order to control for this variable, we conducted a dosing study in which mice were given a range of doses for one single-clade vaccine. It was determined that doses >25 \u03bcg DNA did not significantly improve the immune response and therefore dosing alone could not explain the observed improvement (data not shown). A more likely explanation for this phenomenon is that a greater number of T-cells are activated from a multi-clade vaccine due to a greater number of unique epitopes presented by the vaccine. Interestingly, a multi-clade DNA prime-protein boost also appeared to drive a more functionally divergent T-cell response. Protein and DNA only vaccination produced roughly similar numbers of IFN-\u03b3+/CD8+, and IFN-\u03b3+/CD4+ T-cells, as well as similar numbers of IL-2+/CD4+ and IL-2+/CD8+ T-cells. In contrast, a multi-clade DNA prime-protein boost resulted in four times more IFN-\u03b3+-secreting CD8+ T-cells than IFN-\u03b3+-secreting CD4+ T-cells and higher IL-2+ -secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (Figure 4B&C). Further studies will be required to elucidate the exact mechanistic and phenotypic T-cell differences generated from the enhanced DNA prime-protein boost platform.",
                "In addition to the induction of T-cell responses, consensus envelope vaccination also induced a robust humoral response. We observed that a multi-clade DNA vaccine induced higher antibody titers than the recombinant protein vaccine alone. Such results were surprising considering that recombinant protein has traditionally been the gold standard for antibody-based vaccines. These results may be due to the immunization with the recombinant protein used in this study. A different protein and adjuvant system may also have resulted in higher titers more consistent with those observed from our DNA vaccines. Despite the low antibody activity achieved with a single immunization of rgp120 alone, it served as an effective boosting agent, enhancing binding titers following a single- or multi-clade DNA prime. Between the single- and multi-clade DNA primes, greater antibody levels were achieved with the multi-clade formulation (Figure 7C). Similar to the T-cell responses, this might be a consequence of greater stimulation by a larger number of unique epitopes.",
                "Another important feature of a future HIV vaccination is the breadth of the humoral response. Vaccination with clade A or clade C- DNA immunogens produced binding titers for clade B gp120 equal to those produced by a clade B DNA vaccine. We have similarly observed broad cross-reactive responses with some of our other synthetic consensus vaccines [29]. These broad responses are most likely attributable to the consensus design in which only the most common amino acid sequences are expressed, resulting in the presentation of conserved epitopes. The DNA platform itself may also contribute to the observed breadth, since the final gp140 protein product is more likely to be expressed in a functionally relevant trimeric form with natural glycosylation patterns. We are currently investigating the biological properties of consensus gp140 produced in host cells, focusing particularly on the oligomeric state and localization of the final protein product.",
                "Similar to the data observed for antibody production in mice, the consensus DNA vaccine induced broader neutralizing titers when administered in guinea pigs. A consensus clade A, B, C and D vaccine induced titers against several primary clade viruses. In contrast, clade B recombinant protein induced only clade B neutralizing antibodies. Despite only inducing clade B NAbs when administered alone, recombinant protein delivered after a DNA prime was able to significantly improve the induction of clade A, B, C and D NAbs titers.",
                "Our data support that enhanced DNA vaccines delivered by EP are useful for the induction of strong binding antibody responses against a broad range of viral strains. Combining DNA with a protein boost elicited enhanced NAbs activity against a panel of viral isolates. Thus, the data provide important support that enhanced adaptive EP delivered DNA prime-protein boost is an important strategy for delivering polyvalent Env-based HIV vaccines aimed at improving breath. Further immunization exploration of the immune response induced by diverse HIV DNA cassettes in combination with multiple protein boosts will likely provide important information of relevance to HIV vaccine development."
