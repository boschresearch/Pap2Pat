    "title": "Hepatitis Delta Virus Detected in Salivary Glands of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome Patients and Recapitulates a Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome-Like Phenotype in Vivo",

    "abstract": "Background: Low-level, chronic viral infections have been suspect in the development of select autoimmune diseases, including primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (pSS). Multiple studies have shown stimulation of antiviral response pathways in pSS tissues suggestive of a viral infection. Yet, with this data in hand, a causal link between a viral infection and development of pSS had not been identified. Therefore, a study was designed to further define the viral landscape within pSS-affected salivary gland tissue to identify potential viral-mediated triggers in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease.Methods: A viral microarray was utilized to measure viral transcripts present in salivary gland tissue from patients diagnosed with pSS compared to healthy controls. Murine models of salivary gland localized HDV antigen expression were developed to evaluate the capacity of a chronic HDV signature to trigger the development of a pSS-like phenotype.Results: Through this analysis, two distinct viral profiles were identified, including the increased presence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in 50% of pSS patients evaluated. Presence of HDV antigen and sequence were confirmed in minor salivary gland tissue. Patients with elevated HDV levels in salivary gland tissue were negative for detectible hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen and antibodies to HBV or HDV. Expression of HDV antigens in vivo resulted in reduced stimulated saliva flow, increase in focal lymphocytic infiltrates, and development of autoantibodies.Conclusion: Identification of HDV in pSS patients and induction of a complete pSS-like phenotype in vivo provides further support of a viral-mediated etiopathology in the development of pSS.",

                "Viral infections are thought to play a role in the development of chronic diseases, including autoimmune diseases [1]. While evidence of an antiviral response has been observed in multiple autoimmune diseases [2\u20138], association with a viral agent has not always been clear. This may be attributed to a multifactorial etiology of chronic autoimmunity requiring a genetic susceptibility component in combination with a persistent viral infection or chronic viral exposure to trigger disease pathogenesis. Therefore, a study was designed to further define the viral landscape and potential viral triggers of autoimmunity in disease-affected tissue as illustrated in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.",
                "Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease estimated to affect over 35 million people worldwide [9, 10]. This autoimmune disease is currently diagnosed by a reduction in tear and/or saliva secretion, accumulation of focal lymphocytic infiltrates in salivary gland tissue, and development of antibodies against Ro(SSA), La(SSB), and nuclear proteins [11]. Epidemiological studies have reported patients experiencing subjective xerostomia and development of autoantibodies over a decade prior to diagnosis, suggesting a chronic, slowly progressing development of the disease pathology [12\u201314]. While the underlying trigger(s) of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome remains to be defined, various studies have pointed to an altered genetic susceptibility in connection with environmental exposures, including viral infections.",
                "A common antiviral signature in combination with divergent symptomology suggests a multivariate etiology underlying the Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome phenotype. Clinical studies have reported unique groups within the pSS patient population presenting with different symptom profiles and disease progression based on age of onset, sex, immunological presentation, and extraglandular involvement across a large cohort of pSS patients [15]. Gene expression analyses within affected salivary gland tissue have identified stimulation of antiviral response pathways, including upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) inducible genes and upstream viral-sensing Toll-like receptors [8, 16\u201318]. Although these studies echo a similar overlying antiviral response, the divergent clinical characteristics across the pSS patient population may be due to multiple etiologies, and potentially different viral infections, behind the collective phenotypic presentation of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Prior studies have detected the presence of viruses in salivary glands of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients, including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Coxsackie virus, and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) [19\u201322]. Yet, even with the discovery of these viruses in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients, a clear connection between these viral infections and the development of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome has been difficult to establish.",
                "To globally identify potential viral triggers in the pathogenesis of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, a custom viral microarray was designed to identify low-level transcripts from actively replicating viruses present within salivary gland tissue of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients compared to healthy controls. Through this analysis, multiple virus profiles were identified in the pSS patient cohort evaluated. One of the virus profiles identified included the presence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Taking the next step, we evaluated the capacity of HDV antigens to trigger a Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-like phenotype in vivo."

Briefly, viral genomes were fragmented into 70nt sequences and iterated across 15nt offsets to produce up to 30,000 candidate probes per viral sequence. The resulting 70mer fragments were then blasted against the RefSeq nucleotide database, and probes with E-values < 0.05 were retained. These 70mer sequences were further filtered using Agilent eArray parameters for efficient melting temperature and nucleotide composition rendering optimized 60mer viral microarray probe sequences. A maximum of 5 probes per viral sequence was retained. Each array contained over 3000 probes that recognized putative conserved regions in viruses known to infect animals and covered 31 viral families. RNA isolated from minor salivary gland tissue was processed as previously reported [24].",

Collective analysis identified probes significantly increased across the collective pSS patient group compared to the collective healthy controls and that presented a fold change > 2.0 in pSS relative to healthy controls. Statistical significance was corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method. Subgroup analysis was performed through identifying normalized the probe intensity of each probe and identifying probes for each individual patient that had a greater than a 95% confidence interval of the probe intensity for the collective healthy controls. Probes selected for further analysis presented with intensities greater than the 95% confidence interval of healthy controls and were present in at least 25% of the pSS patient samples tested. Pairwise correlations between normalized probe intensities of probes present in subgroups of pSS were then identified and mapped using JMP (v.10.0) statistical software from SAS. Heatmap and cluster analysis were generated using CIMminer (NCI)."

This study contained a higher percent of males (47%) than normally reported for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patient populations (5-10%). No significant difference in sex ratio was observed between the HDVlow and HDVhigh pSS groups. Total stimulated saliva flow was significantly decreased in the HDVlow pSS group (7.56 \u00b1 7.19, P < 0.05) compared to healthy controls (18.28 \u00b1 11.27). Focus score was significantly increased in both the HDVlow group (2.43 \u00b1 1.27, P < 0.0001) and HDVhigh group (1.37\u00b11.06, P < 0.05). Tear production was significantly decreased in the HDVlow group (3.8 \u00b1 2.8, P < 0.005) and HDVhigh group (7.0 \u00b1 6.0, P <0.05) relative to healthy controls (19.2 \u00b1 12.07) as measured by Schirmer's test. Together, the HDVhigh patient group displayed a less pronounced clinical presentation of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome symptoms and antibody profiles than the HDVlow patient group."

                        "An animal model was developed to evaluate the potential of HDV antigens to initiate development of a Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome phenotype in vivo. Hepatitis delta virus is a negative sense single strand RNA (ssRNA) virus that is classically thought to require a helper virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), for packaging and transmission [37]. The ~1700nt circular HDV genome contains a single open reading frame and expresses two proteins, the small antigen (S-HDAg) and the large antigen (L-HDAg). The S-HDAg is responsible for initiation of RNA genome replication and is expressed early in the infection cycle. The L-HDAg is expressed in later stages of viral infection and plays a role in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex packaging. In the classic HBV:HDV coinfection model, the HDV genome, S-HDAg, and L-HDAg form the RNP complex and are packaged into the coat membrane of HBV. Due to the absence of HBV in the pSS viral profile, recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) was used to deliver HDV genes to recapitulate the chronic HDV infection. Female C57BL/6 received rAAV containing S-HDAg, L-HDAg, or a combination of S-HDAg/L-HDAg expression cassettes through retrograde cannulation to salivary gland tissue. These three in vivo models depicted different stages of the HDV infection cycle. rAAV containing a luciferase expression cassette was utilized in the control group to account for rAAV-mediated responses. Immunohistochemical detection of HDAg rendered a nuclear localized pattern of protein expression as delivered by rAAV (Supplemental Figure 2). Mice were monitored for 4 months post-cannulation for development of autoantibodies, changes in stimulated saliva flow and focal lymphocytic infiltration in salivary gland tissue.",
                        "Expression of HDV antigens in mouse salivary gland tissue triggered the development of autoantibodies (Figure 4(A-D). Mice expressing S-HDAg, depicting an early HDV infection, showed a significant increase in total IgG, ANA, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB levels. Mice expressing L-HDAg showed a significant increase in total IgG and anti-SSA. Mice expressing a combination of S-HDAg and L-HDAg, depicting a later stage of HDV infection, showed a significant increase in anti-SSA. The strongest autoantibody profile was observed in mice expressing S-HDAg, representative of early stages of HDV infection.",
                        "Expression of S-HDAg in mouse salivary gland tissue resulted in a significant decrease in stimulated saliva flow (Figure 4E). Mice were monitored for pilocarpine-stimulated saliva flow at 4 months post cannulation. Mice expressing S-HDAg resulted in a statistically significant decrease in pilocarpine-stimulated saliva flow relative to controls. No change in pilocarpine-stimulated saliva production was noted in mice that expressed the L-HDAg or combined S-HDAg/L-HDAg expression. Together, our data suggest that the expression of S-HDAg, representative of early stages of HDV infection, possesses the capacity to impact stimulated saliva flow.",
                        "Expression of both S-HDAg and L-HDAg, depicting a later stage of HDV infection, resulted in a significant increase in focal lymphocytic infiltration in salivary gland tissue. Focal accumulation of lymphocytes within the affected salivary gland is a hallmark in pSS diagnosis. In contrast to the S-HDAg mediated reduction in saliva flow and strong autoantibody profile, mice that expressed combined S-HDAg/L-HDAg showed a significant increase in lymphocytic foci (Figure 4F). No significant increase in lymphocytic foci was noted with singular expression of S-HDAg or L-HDAg in the salivary glands compared to control mice (Figure 4F). The variance in the area of the foci in mice expressing the combination of S-HDAg and L-HDAg was observed to be increased compared to the area of foci in the control mice (Supplemental Figure 3A-B). Ectopic lymphoid structures were also evident in mice expressing combined S-HDAg/L-HDAg (Supplemental Figure 3C). Additionally, similar to the pSS patient cohort, mice expressing HDV antigens in salivary gland tissue did not develop detectible antibodies to HDV antigens (data not shown)."

                "This study identified the presence of HDV in a subset of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients. The detection of HDV by custom viral microarray was subsequently confirmed by detection of the HDV antigen in affected salivary gland tissue and detection of the HDV sequence in two pSS cohorts and by an independent research team. Animal models were developed to evaluate the potential for HDV antigens expressed in salivary gland tissue to trigger development of a Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-like phenotype. We have shown that the expression of HDV antigens in mouse salivary gland recapitulates the development of a complete pSS-like phenotype in vivo. Together, the identification of HDV in the affected salivary gland tissue of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients and the demonstrated ability of HDV antigens to trigger the pathogenesis of a pSS-like phenotype in vivo provide further support for a viral-mediated mechanism in the development of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.",
                "The timeline for developing Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome pathogenesis mirrors the HDV-mediated Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome phenotype observed in our animal model and in the known HDV infection cycle (Figure 5). Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients have reported subjective xerostomia and develop an autoantibody profile years prior to disease diagnosis [12\u201314]. Mirroring this behavior, the mice expressing S-HDAg, representing an early stage of HDV infection, presented the strongest autoantibody profile and significant reduction in stimulated saliva flow. In humans, lymphocytic infiltrates in the salivary gland tissue are evaluated and detected at later stages of pSS pathogenesis. In the mouse model, the combined expression of S-HDAg and L-HDAg, depicting a later stage HDV infection profile, resulted in a significant accumulation of lymphocytic foci in vivo. Together, the chronological development of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome echoes the progression of a chronic, low-grade HDV infection in the salivary gland as observed in our HDV animal model.",
                "Chronic HDV infections have previously been associated with triggering a clear antiviral response and development of autoimmunity. Multiple studies have shown the capacity of HDV antigens to stimulate expression of or directly interact with multiple interferon-stimulated genes and genes associated with pSS pathogenesis, including SSB/La protein [38\u201341]. Prior studies have associated HDV infections with the development of autoantibodies, including ANA, liver-kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM), and smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), among others [42\u201344]. Our data, in connection with prior reports of HDV-mediated autoantibody development, further support the potential of HDV to trigger development of pSS-associated autoimmunity. The type of autoantibody profile developed in the presence of HDV may be dependent on the tissues and cellular localization of active HDV persistence.",
                "Detection of HDV in the salivary gland tissue of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients in the absence of HBV points to a unique tissue tropism and/or mechanism of persistence not previously identified. Hepatitis delta virus can readily replicate its genome and antigens using host cellular mechanisms, enabling persistence in the absence of an active helper virus infection, and has been shown to persist in tissue culture at low levels for at least a year in the absence of a helper virus [27, 37, 38]. Therefore, once inside the cell, HDV is able to establish a chronic presence. In our hands, evidence of a past or current HBV infection has not been identified in affected salivary gland tissue in pSS patients that are HDV positive. This is in line with prior studies evaluating the incidence of HBV infection in pSS studies that have found similar or lower HBV infection rates in pSS patients [36, 45, 46]. The question remains as to how HDV gains entry into the salivary glands of pSS patients in the absence of a detectible current or past HBV infection. Prior studies have shown cell-mediated immune response to low-level viral infections and/or exposures in the absence of antibody production [47]. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential of cell-mediated immune response to low level HDV and HBV antigens in the absence of a detectible humoral immune response in both the pSS patient population and HDV animal models.",
                "Further analysis is needed to identify primary routes of infection and viable antiviral therapeutics. Prior studies have shown the sequence homology of genotype 1 HDV infections associated with HDV:HBV coinfection ranges between 91.2% and 91.7% [48, 49]. In our study, a higher percent of sequence homology of 98.5% (between 97.3%-99.3%) was observed in pSS patients. This high degree of sequence homology between patient samples may be a factor of the low level rate of genome replication or a stable primary reservoir. Multiple therapies are being evaluated for treatment of chronic HDV infection associated with HBV coinfection, including lonafarnib, tipifarnib, and FTI-277 [50, 51]. The primary mechanism of these drugs inhibits farnesyl transferase activity, which is required for the post-translational modification of the L-HDAg facilitating interaction with HBsAg and packaging in the HBV virion. While these drugs have shown success in treating HDV in relation to HDV:HBV coinfection, it is unclear at this stage whether these drugs would have a similar effect in the chronic HDV present in salivary gland tissues of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patients and in the absence of an active HBV infection. Ongoing studies are focused on how HDV gains entry into salivary gland tissue in the absence of a detectible HBV infection and the underlying mechanism(s) of HDV-mediated pSS disease pathogenesis.",
                "Multiple viral infections have been associated with the development of sialadenitis and sicca symptoms similar to that in pSS patients. As primary examples, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are noted to trigger sialadenitis, sicca symptoms, and distinct autoantibody profiles [52\u201354]. Identifying the association between these viral infections and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome symptoms has refocused the therapeutic approach to treating the underlying viral infection. HIV and HCV are now exclusion criteria in the diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome [11]. The identification of HDV in pSS patients and the recapitulation of disease phenotype in vivo follows a similar path of study previously reported for HCV in pSS populations and in vivo [52, 55]. Therefore, we postulate that HDV may be another viral infection resulting in the development of a Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-like phenotype, and further analysis is warranted to evaluate the diagnosis of a chronic HDV infection as an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Identifying the Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome patient population that is HDV positive will refocus the therapeutic approach from generalized immune suppression to targeted antiviral therapies.",
                "Prior studies that have introduced the expression of viral proteins, including HCV and HTLV-1 proteins, or endogenous proteins associated with pSS, including bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP-6), have shown incomplete primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome-like phenotypes [24, 55, 56]. Most notably, these prior studies have lacked the production of pSS-associated autoantibodies to SSA/ Ro or SSB/La proteins. Our study identified the increased presence of HDV in the salivary gland tissue of pSS patients and targeted expression of HDV antigens in murine salivary glands resulted in the development of a complete Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome phenotype. Together, these data suggest that the simple expression of a viral or endogenous protein or general viral infections in the salivary gland are not sufficient to elicit a complete pSS-like disease phenotype and that the pSS disease pathogenesis may be a targeted response to a specific viral exposure.",
                "Analysis of clinical features based on the level of HDV within affected salivary gland tissue revealed a less pronounced disease symptomology in the HDVhigh pSS patients. The detection of HDV in patients experiencing sicca symptoms but not meeting full criteria for pSS diagnosis may provide an early window for diagnosis and intervention prior to progression of pSS-associated pathology. Pertovaara et al. reported that 36% of patients experiencing sicca symptoms progress to development of pSS [57]. Our current hypothesis is that HDV-positive sicca patients may either be at early stages of the disease progression or are missing a cellular or genetic susceptibility factor required for progression of disease pathology. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical differences between HDVhigh and HDVlow pSS patients and to evaluate disease progression or resolution in HDV-positive sicca patients to help define the susceptibility factors supporting or restricting chronic persistence of HDV in salivary gland tissue.",
                "Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is not considered to be an infectious or contagious disease. Therefore multiple factors, including genetic susceptibility, favorable cellular and/or tissue environment, and/or exposure to pathogen(s), may be required to promote a viral-mediated development of pSS pathology. Further large-scale studies are needed to define the incidence of HDV in global pSS patient cohorts and the underlying genetic susceptibility factors impacting HDV-mediated disease pathogenesis."
