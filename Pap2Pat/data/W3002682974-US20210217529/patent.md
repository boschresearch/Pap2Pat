# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

The present invention generally relates to health care technology and more specifically, to assessing unreliability of clinical risk prediction.

To provide care for patients, the health care system includes a variety of participants, including doctors, nurses, and other hospital-related personnel. To help clinicians navigate risk assessment, a variety of informatics-based tools have been developed to evaluate potential outcomes associated with treatment options. These risk assessment tools are generally provided by a third-party software, and made available to a clinician through software applications.

## SUMMARY

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to assessing the reliability of clinical risk predictions. A non-limiting example computer-implemented method includes identifying a respective estimated clinical risk score for each of a first group of patients and a second group of patients. An alternative probability estimate is generated using a same set of inputs used to determine each respective estimated clinical risk score. An unreliability of a patient's clinical risk score is determined based at least in part on a feature of the patient and on a difference between the alternative probability estimate and the determined respective estimated clinical risk score.

Other embodiments of the present invention implement features of the above-described method in computer systems and computer program products.

Additional technical features and benefits are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed subject matter. For a better understanding, refer to the detailed description and to the drawings.

The diagrams depicted herein are illustrative. There can be many variations to the diagrams or the operations described therein without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance, the actions can be performed in a differing order or actions can be added, deleted or modified. Also, the term “coupled” and variations thereof describes having a communications path between two elements and does not imply a direct connection between the elements with no intervening elements/connections between them. All of these variations are considered a part of the specification.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a clinical decision support system that provides a clinician with a patient-specific reliability measure for each clinical risk score provided by the system.

Conventional methods to estimate the reliability of the clinical risk scores generally fall into two categories: model-dependent and model-independent methods. Model-dependent methods generally report prediction confidence intervals that generally are calculated via least-squares estimation or by estimating the uncertainty in learned model parameters. Some neural network models evaluate whether there are sufficient data in the training set to make a prediction for a test sample or whether the test sample is similar to a region of the training set where the model has poor performance. However, this approach mandates the use of a particular type of classifier.

Model-independent approaches can be used with a variety of different predictive models, irrespective of the approach used to develop/train the model. Conventional model-independent approaches involve retraining the predictive model using an enhanced dataset that contains the original training set supplemented with new, unclassified data examples, where class labels for the unlabeled data are assigned based on the model's predictions. The model's performance before and after retraining are used to estimate the reliability of the predicted classes for the new data. However, a disadvantage of model-independent approaches is that, in practice, clinical datasets that are used to develop clinical risk scores are generally not available to users who would like to evaluate the reliability of a new prediction. Therefore, retraining a model with new data (or directly assessing how different a new patient is from the training examples) is generally not possible, given the rightful concerns over guarding patient privacy. These approaches can therefore only be implemented by those who have access to the original dataset used to train the risk model in question. More importantly, even if such data were available, retraining complex models can be computationally expensive, thereby making this approach infeasible for the average user who has access to limited computational resources, or who requires some estimate of the reliability of a given patient's prediction within a short time frame.

One model-independent approach, the “trust score”, does not require that the classifier be retrained. However, to be computed it still requires access to the original training data, which may not be available to all health care providers. Furthermore, none of the above-described approaches have been evaluated in the setting of significant class imbalance. This is relevant as many clinical classification problems are associated with large class imbalance as the outcome of interest typically occurs in a small minority of patients.

Certain clinical scores may be evaluated for accuracy. For example, a clinical risk score may be applied to a million patients to determine if a clinical risk score is accurate. However, this is different than determining whether a clinical risk score is reliable for a particular patient. If the clinical risk score is accurate for ninety percent of the million patients, there is still one hundred thousand patients that the clinical risk score is inaccurate. Therefore, a need exists to proactively determine which patient belongs in the ninety percent and which patient belongs in the ten percent prior to the onset of treatment.

One or more embodiments of the present invention address one or more of the above-described shortcomings by providing a clinical decision support system that identifies patient subgroups that are associated with poor model performance, is model-independent, does not require retraining or access to the precise training dataset used to develop the original clinical risk model, and uses generative models to alleviate class imbalance.

Turning now to FIG. 1, a clinical decision support system is generally shown in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. The system 100 includes a reliability assessment module 102, a server 106, and a database including a patient's electronic medical records (EMRs) profile 104. The reliability assessment module 102 includes a set of algorithms that can be stored on the computing device 108, the server 106, or some other computing device or memory.

The reliability assessment module 102 is operable to assess the reliability of a clinical risk score for an individual patient by computing an absolute value of a difference between an alternative estimated risk score and the original risk score. The reliability assessment module 102 then determines whether the difference is greater than a pre-defined threshold value. If the difference is greater than a threshold value, the original clinical risk score is deemed unreliable, if the difference is lower than the threshold, the original risk score is deemed reliable. The reliability assessment module 102 can further evaluate the difference in terms of multiple thresholds and further provide a degree of reliability or unreliability. For example, an original clinical risk score may have low unreliability or high unreliability based on respective thresholds.

The computing device 108, includes any computing device available to a clinician, such as a tablet, laptop, PC or the like. The computing device includes a user interface that provides the clinician with the clinical risk scores associated with a patient, a patient profile, any treatments or procedures that have been scheduled for the patient, a clinical, profile, and the reliability score for each respective clinical risk score.

In order to determine reliability, the following method can be followed:

Let {right arrow over (x)} denote a random variable corresponding to a set of prognostic characteristics (the feature vector). Let yϵ{0,1} denote a random variable designating the true class label. For example, y=1 if a patient dies within a specified time after an initial diagnosis (the positive class) and y=0 if the patient does not die within the specified time (the negative class). Finally, let f({right arrow over (x)}) be a clinical risk model that takes a feature vector as an input and outputs a risk score that can be used to estimate the probability of the true class label.

As clinical risk models generally report the probability of an adverse event, or some score that can be translated into a probability, f({right arrow over (x)}) is considered to be a probability; (i.e., f({right arrow over (x)})=PE(y=1|{right arrow over (x)}), where PE(y=1{right arrow over (x)}) is the probability that y=1 for a patient with feature vector {right arrow over (x)}. The superscript E designates that this probability is estimated from a training dataset). The metric to calculate the alternative risk score, (y=1|{right arrow over (x)}), uses the same data that was used to calculate f({right arrow over (x)}) and is calculated using generative models for both the positive and negative classes (hence the superscript G). When f({right arrow over (x)}) and PG(y=1{right arrow over (x)}) disagree, the training data is insufficient to provide a robust, trustworthy prediction.

The reliability assessment module 102 does not require training a new model using the training dataset, it can derive an expression for (y=1|{right arrow over (x)}) that is straightforward to compute. For example, using Bayes' theorem, express PG(y=1|{right arrow over (x)}) as follows:

\({\left( {y = \left. 1 \middle| \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \right.} \right) = \frac{\left( {\left. \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \middle| y \right. = 1} \right){P\left( {y = 1} \right)}}{{{P^{G}\left( {\left. \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \middle| y \right. = 1} \right)}{P\left( {y = 1} \right)}} + {{P^{G}\left( {\left. \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \middle| y \right. = 0} \right)}\left( {1 - {P\left( {y = 1} \right)}} \right)}}},\)

where P(y=1) is the prevalence of the adverse outcome in the overall population and is estimated using the fraction of patients who belong to the positive class in the training dataset. Calculating (y=1|{right arrow over (x)}) requires an estimation of the likelihood of observing a given feature vector in the positive class, PG({right arrow over (x)}|y=1), and the negative class, PG({right arrow over (x)}|y=0). These likelihoods are estimated using trained generative models where one model generates feature vectors consistent with patients in the positive class, ({right arrow over (x)}|y=1), and the other generates feature vectors consistent with patients in the negative class, ({right arrow over (x)}|y=0). In practice, PG({right arrow over (x)}|y=0) is agnostic to the type of generative model, for example, a multivariate normal (MVN) probability density function (pdf). More sophisticated models for the positive and negative class can be used when the training data are not well described by Gaussian probability density functions.

The above-described equation uses calculated definite integrals of multidimensional Gaussian pdfs, as the probabilities correspond to integrals over the pdfs. An alternative formula to describe a probability function can be described as follows:

\({{U\left( \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \right)} = {\hat{y}\frac{\left( \frac{1 - \hat{y}}{\hat{y}} \right) - {\beta_{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}^{- 1}\left( \frac{1 - {P\left( {y = 1} \right)}}{P\left( {y = 1} \right)} \right)}}{1 + {\beta_{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}^{- 1}\left( \frac{1 - {P\left( {y = 1} \right)}}{P\left( {y = 1} \right)} \right)}}}},\)

where U({right arrow over (x)}) is the alternative clinical risk score. Furthermore, this formula uses the numerical calculation of a univariate probability density.

It should be appreciated that although two formulas have been described, the methods and system described herein can use a variety of formulas to discern an alternative risk score. The server 106 stores a database 110 with a collection of patient clinical data that includes information regarding demographics, allergies, diagnosis, laboratory results, operations, narratives, specialist's reports, vital signs, and any other appropriate patient-related data. The server 106 further stores a database of a clinician's prior decisions 112.

In embodiments where the reliability assessment module 102 is implemented as a neural network, neuromorphic systems include interconnected processor elements that act as simulated “neurons” and exchange “messages” between each other in the form of electronic signals. Similar to the so-called “plasticity” of synaptic neurotransmitter connections that carry messages between biological neurons, the connections in neuromorphic systems such as neural networks carry electronic messages between simulated neurons, which are provided with numeric weights that correspond to the strength or weakness of a given connection. The weights can be adjusted and tuned based on experience, making neuromorphic systems adaptive to inputs and capable of learning. For example, a neuromorphic/neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons, which can be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by a function determined by the network's designer, the activations of these input neurons are then passed to other downstream neurons, which are often referred to as “hidden” neurons. This process is repeated until an output neuron is activated. Multiple pre-neurons and post-neurons can be connected through an array of resistive switching devices (RSDs), which naturally expresses a fully-connected neural network. In the descriptions here, any functionality ascribed to the system 100 that can be implemented using the processing system 500 applies.

Referring to FIG. 2, a method for assessing the reliability of clinical risk prediction is shown. At block 202 a set of EMR data is retrieved from a database and segregated between positive and negative patient data sets. Positive patients are patients that have experienced some adverse outcome and negative patients are patients that have not experienced an adverse outcome. The EMRs are in either structured or unstructured format. Therefore, in some instances, the system may rely on metadata embedded in the EMRs or use natural language processing techniques to identify the patients as positive or negative. In many instances, the dataset will skew against positive patients resulting in a class imbalance.

At block 204a a generative model is trained using the positive patient data and at block 204b a generative model is trained using the negative patient data. This can be implemented by configuring and arranging the processing system 500 to execute machine learning (ML) algorithms. The generative model learns an underlying data distribution and is then able to generate synthetic data from the same distribution. For example, the system fits a distribution to a set of features identified for a particular patient population. Therefore, in the event that the positive patient data set is small, the system has an appropriate amount of data for subsequent steps.

At block 206a, the system samples synthetic data from the positive generator. At block 206b, the system samples synthetic data from the negative generator. At block 208a the system then processes samples from the original positive patient data set and the synthetic data set through a classifier, for example, the risk model, a plurality of risk models, including the original risk model whose reliability/unreliability is being verified. It should be appreciated that in the event that the system determines that the original data provides a large enough sample size, the system uses only the original data. At block 208b the system then processes samples from the original negative patient data set and the synthetic data set through a classifier, for example, a risk model, a plurality of risk models, including the original risk model whose reliability/unreliability is being verified. Each risk model provides an output for each patient, which can be mapped on to a positive patient and negative patient numerical distribution, for example, a histogram, a plot, a chart, or other distribution at block 210a and 210b.

At block 212a, the system determines whether the numerical distribution of the positive patients has converged. At block 212b, the system determines whether the numerical distribution of the negative patients has converged. If either numerical distribution has not converged, the system moves back to either block 206a or 206b and samples more data to process through the classifier. At block 214a, the system calculates a relative likelihood PG({right arrow over (x)}|y=1) for use in the alternate risk estimate (y=1|{right arrow over (x)}). At block 214b, the system calculates a relative likelihood PG({right arrow over (x)}|y=0) for use in the alternate risk estimate (y=1|{right arrow over (x)}). For example, by estimating a probability density function of the numerical distribution.

At block 216, the system calculates an alternative risk score for a patient currently receiving care, for example, by applying Bayes' theorem using the results from steps 214a and 214b.

At block 218, the system computes an absolute value of the difference between the alternative estimate and the original clinical risk score. The greater the difference between the estimates, the less reliable the original clinical risk score is.

The reliability determinations for multiple clinical risk scores are calculated based on the samples generated. For example, reliability determinations for clinical risk scores for patients that have diabetes and prior heart issues are calculated. Reliability determinations for clinical risk scores for patients with diabetes that had no prior heart issues are also calculated. As a clinician meets with a patient, each of the patient features is inputted into the clinician's computer system. Then as the clinical risk scores for the patient are provided, the system matches the patient's individual features with a reliability/unreliability determination derived from data from patients having similar features. The system displays whether the clinical risk score is reliable/unreliable for that particular patient. Based on an indication of reliability, the system reviews the past decisions of the clinician(s) and retrieves a list of suggested treatments or medications based on the past decisions. In some embodiments of the present invention, the system further removes clinical risk scores that are determined to be unreliable for that patient from the clinician's user interface, this can occur during a patient's visit or automatically before a subsequent visit, but after the initial visit.

Based on an indication of reliability or unreliability, the system is operable to modify a clinician's user interface. For example, in a typical setting a user interface may include frame or a drop-down menu that includes descriptive titles with links for each clinical risk score of a patient. For example, the list includes descriptive titles such as “ADA Diabetes Risk”, “Breast Cancer Risk”, and “CAGE alcohol screening”. A clinician can, through text, voice command, cursor, touch or other appropriate method, select one of these descriptive titles/links and receive an associated clinical risk score. Based on the unreliability scores, the system is operable to modify the visual appearance of the descriptive titles to alert the clinical, prior to viewing the actual clinical risk score. For example, a color of the descriptive titles can be modified to signal a degree of unreliability or reliability. High unreliability clinical risk scores can have descriptive titles listed in red, medium unreliability scores can have descriptive titles in orange, and low unreliability clinical risk scores can have descriptive titles in green. In this sense, the clinician is alerted in regard to an unreliability prior to viewing the score.

In other embodiments, the descriptive titles can be rearranged in order of reliability or unreliability. In yet even other embodiments, the descriptive titles/links can be subdivided from a single frame to multiple frames, in which each frame includes descriptive titles based on a relative unreliability. For example a first frame may include descriptive titles/links for clinical risk scores that have high unreliability and a second frame may include descriptive titles/links for clinical risk scores that have low unreliability.

In yet another embodiment, the system reviews the patient's EMR to determine the primary care physician, pharmacist, or other health care professionals currently providing health care or have previously provided. In some iterations, the system further determines the nature of the treatment. Upon learning the identity, the system issues an electronic communication to the primary care physician, pharmacist, or other health care professionals that a clinical risk score has been deemed unreliable. In some iterations, the communications are based on whether the treatment or medication provided relates to the clinical risk score. In this sense, health care professionals without access to the unreliability score have access to the determination. Therefore, other health care professionals can alter their treatment based on the understanding of the unreliability of the clinical risk scores.

Based on an indication of an unreliable clinical risk score, the physician would integrate the unreliability score into their clinical decision making process. For example, a number of clinical guidelines suggest that patients who are at high risk of death, as assessed via standard clinical risk scores, after a myocardial infarction, should undergo coronary angiography—an invasive procedure associated with its own risks. However, if the associate clinical risk score is deemed unreliable for that patient, then the clinician may decide to forgo coronary angiography for that patient. In general, the physician may follow or hold-off applying more aggressive counseling, applying a certain screening (e.g., adding a patch monitor for atrial fibrillation patients), favoring adding a certain medication (or changing a dose), performing or holding-off a biopsy, etc. depending on how unreliable the associated risk score is. In another embodiment, several commonly used scores may be calculated for the patient (e.g., MELD, Framingham risk score, EHR-AF, CHARGE), and each score would also be associated with an unreliability rank. The physician may decide to avoid using the one or more scores that were found unreliable and prefer the one or more scores that were associated with low unreliability ranks. A physician may decide also to avoid the use of any scores, and follow his/her experience or judgment for further treatments or holding-off treatments.

The above-described method has been tested using real-world data. The unreliability metric, U({right arrow over (x)}), is a function of the risk model, f({right arrow over (x)}), the prevalence of the outcome of interest in the overall population, P(y=1), and the relative likelihood ratio of the positive and negative classes arising from the generative models, β{right arrow over (x)}. To understand how each of these quantities affects the unreliability estimate, U({right arrow over (x)}) was computed for a range of input parameters and then the average value of U({right arrow over (x)}) was calculated as a function of the risk model prediction. Two limiting cases were considered: i) when there is no class imbalance in the training data (P(y=1)=0.5), and ii) when the positive class (y=1) is in the minority (P(y=1)=0.01). When there is no class imbalance on average, values of the clinical risk score that are close to 0 or 1 are slightly more unreliable than values close to 0.5, which is equal to the prevalence of the outcome in the population. By contrast, on average, when there is a significant class imbalance, unreliable predictions are more likely to occur in patients who are predicted to be at high risk. In other words, when there is a relatively small number of patients who belong to the positive class, and consequently few positive examples for the clinical model to learn from, positive predictions are, on average, more likely to have high values of U({right arrow over (x)}).

U({right arrow over (x)}) was computed for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score, which quantifies the risk of death 6-months after presenting with an acute coronary syndrome. The goal was to compute U({right arrow over (x)}) for patients in the GRACE registry, identify the most unreliable predictions in this cohort, and evaluate the performance of the GRACE score on this “unreliable” subgroup.

U({right arrow over (x)}) was computed for all patients in the GRACE test set and the accuracy of predictions that have high unreliability relative to those who have a lower unreliability score was evaluated. First, it should be noted, patients who are predicted to be high risk are more likely, on average, to have high unreliability scores. Calibration curves demonstrated that patients within the upper 50% of unreliability values tended to overestimate a patient's risk of death, while predictions within the lower 50% of unreliability values were well-calibrated.

To more quantitatively assess the accuracy of predictions arising from the GRACE score in unreliable patient subgroups the Brier score was relied upon. Formally, the Brier score is the mean square error between the prediction and the true class label (i.e., lower Brier scores indicate more accurate predictions). However, the Brier score itself is dependent on the prevalence of the outcome of interest, and consequently can be difficult to interpret when assessing the performance of a classifier on subgroups that have different expected outcome rates (i.e., the Brier score tends to be lower when the incidence of the outcome is low). Therefore, the Brier score was normalized by a Brier null model, which corresponds to the scenario where every patient is predicted to have a risk equal to the prevalence of the outcome in that respective subgroup. Predictions corresponding to the top 50% of U({right arrow over (x)}) values have a modest, yet statistically significant, reduced accuracy, as measured via a normalized Brier score, relative to predictions that fall within the lower 50% of U({right arrow over (x)}) values.

The AUC (or C-statistic) for patients was computed to assess the discriminatory ability of the GRACE risk score in patients who have unreliable predictions. The GRACE score similarly has relatively poor discriminatory ability in predictions that fall within the top 50% of U({right arrow over (x)}) values.

Calibration curves for predictions that fall within the top 1% of U({right arrow over (x)}) values (henceforth referred to as the “most unreliable predictions”) similarly underestimate the actual risk of death. Similarly, the prediction error, measured via a normalized Brier score, for the subgroup consisting of the most unreliable predictions was significantly higher than the error associated with all other patients in the dataset. The AUC for the most unreliable subgroup was also significantly reduced relative to the AUC of the remainder of the test data set, suggesting that predictions for the most unreliable subgroup have significantly reduced discriminatory ability relative to the remainder of the dataset.

To assess whether these findings were unique to the unreliability metric, or whether they generalized to other metrics that strive to quantify the reliability in a given risk prediction, an alternate metric was computed that purports to quantify when a given classifier's result should be trusted. The trust score measures the agreement between the classifier and a nearest-neighbor classifier on a testing example. At a high level, the score measures the distance between a given test set example and training examples in each class (i.e., the set consisting of training examples that have the outcome of interest and the set of training examples that do not). For a binary classification problem, the trust score is the ratio between the distance to the alternate class and the distance between the predicted class. Unlike the herein-described unreliability metric, which associates high values of U({right arrow over (x)}) with unreliable predictions, low trust scores denote predictions that are untrustworthy as they are more similar to training examples in the class that is different from the one that the model predicts.

Calibration curves for the most untrustworthy predictions (i.e., predictions within the lowest 1% of trust values) demonstrated that the method identifies poorly calibrated risk estimates. Predictions within the top 1% of trust score values underestimated the actual patient risk. However, predictions in the remainder of the dataset tended to overestimate patient risk. Moreover, normalized Brier scores suggested that the most untrustworthy predictions have errors that are similar to that of predictions in the remainder of the dataset. Calculated AUCs of both subgroups suggest that the discriminatory ability of the classifier is similar in both the most untrustworthy subgroup and in the subgroup containing all other remaining patients.

To determine whether the findings generalized to other outcomes and risk scores, a model was generated to predict the risk of in-hospital stroke in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome. Unreliability scores were again computed for all patients. The most unreliable patients form a subgroup whose risk is underestimated by the model, while the model was well calibrated for all other patients in the dataset. The average error for patients in the most unreliable subgroup was larger than the average error for other patients in the dataset, as expected, although this difference is not statistically significant. The discriminatory ability of the classifier was reduced in the most unreliable cohort, relative to the classifier's discriminatory ability in the remainder of the data.

Trust score values were again computed for the Stroke Risk model predictions and the performance of the subgroup consisting of the most untrustworthy predictions was evaluated. Similar to what was observed with the trust calculations on the GRACE risk model, predictions with the highest trust score underestimate the overall risk of stroke. However, the average prediction error associated with this untrustworthy subgroup is lower than that of the other patients in the dataset, and the corresponding difference is statistically significant. Moreover, the discriminatory ability of the stroke risk score was actually higher in the untrustworthy subgroup.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics, at least three service models, and at least four deployment models.

Characteristics are as follows:

On-demand self-service: a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service's provider.

Broad network access: capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).

Resource pooling: the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).

Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls)

Deployment Models are as follows:

Private cloud: the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.

Community cloud: the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.

Public cloud: the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud: the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).

A cloud computing environment is a service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure that includes a network of interconnected nodes.

Referring now to FIG. 4, illustrative cloud computing environment 50 is depicted. As shown, cloud computing environment 50 comprises one or more cloud computing nodes 10 with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers, such as, for example, personal digital assistant (PDA) or cellular telephone 54A, desktop computer 54B, laptop computer 54C, and/or automobile computer system 54N may communicate. Nodes 10 may communicate with one another. They may be grouped (not shown) physically or virtually, in one or more networks, such as Private, Community, Public, or Hybrid clouds as described hereinabove, or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment 50 to offer infrastructure, platforms and/or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices 54A-N shown in FIG. 4 are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes 10 and cloud computing environment 50 can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and/or network addressable connection (e.g., using a web browser).

Processors 521 are coupled to system memory (e.g., random access memory (RAM) 524) and various other components via a system bus 533. Read only memory (ROM) 522 is coupled to system bus 533 and may include a basic input/output system (BIOS), which controls certain basic functions of the processing system 500.

Further depicted are an input/output (I/O) adapter 527 and a network adapter 526 coupled to the system bus 533. I/O adapter 527 may be a small computer system interface (SCSI) adapter that communicates with a hard disk 523 and/or a storage device 525 or any other similar component. I/O adapter 527, hard disk 523, and storage device 525 are collectively referred to herein as mass storage 534. Operating system 540 for execution on processing system 500 may be stored in mass storage 534. The network adapter 526 interconnects system bus 533 with an outside network 536 enabling processing system 500 to communicate with other such systems. A display (e.g., a display monitor) 535 is connected to the system bus 533 by display adapter 532, which may include a graphics adapter to improve the performance of graphics intensive applications and a video controller. In one aspect of the present disclosure, adapters 526, 527, and/or 532 may be connected to one or more I/O busses that are connected to the system bus 533 via an intermediate bus bridge (not shown). Suitable I/O buses for connecting peripheral devices such as hard disk controllers, network adapters, and graphics adapters typically include common protocols, such as the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI). Additional input/output devices are shown as connected to system bus 533 via user interface adapter 528 and display adapter 532. An input device 529 (e.g., a keyboard, a microphone, a touchscreen, etc.), an input pointer 530 (e.g., a mouse, trackpad, touchscreen, etc.), and/or a speaker 531 may be interconnected to system bus 533 via user interface adapter 528, which may include, for example, a Super I/O chip integrating multiple device adapters into a single integrated circuit

In some aspects of the present disclosure, the processing system 500 includes a graphics processing unit 537. Graphics processing unit 537 is a specialized electronic circuit designed to manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. In general, graphics processing unit 537 is very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing and has a highly parallel structure that makes it more effective than general-purpose CPUs for algorithms where processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel.

Thus, as configured herein, the processing system 500 includes processing capability in the form of processors 521, storage capability including system memory (e.g., RAM 524), and mass storage 534, input means such as keyboard 529 and mouse 530, and output capability including speaker 531 and display 535. In some aspects of the present disclosure, a portion of system memory (e.g., RAM 524) and mass storage 534 collectively store the operating system 540 to coordinate the functions of the various components shown in the processing system 500.
