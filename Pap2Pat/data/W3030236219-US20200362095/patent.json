                        "Bottlebrush polymers (also referred to a polymer brushes) are macromolecules comprising polymeric sidechains attached to a linear polymeric backbone. Bottlebrush polymers are types of branched or graft polymer, and have unique properties due to their highly branched structure. The high molecular weight and high sidechain grafting density typical of bottlebrush polymers can allow these macromolecules to self-assemble into well-defined structures with large domain sizes. Such properties give these polymers potential applications in, e.g., photonics, chromatography media, stimuli-responsive materials, lubricants, nanolithography, films, coatings, and drug delivery.",
                        "Bottlebrush copolymers are bottlebrush polymers comprising two or more different polymeric sidechains (i.e., two or more sidechains of different polymeric composition). These copolymers can be block copolymers, or copolymers wherein the polymeric sidechains are mixed and/or randomly dispersed. For a review on the structure, function, self-assembly, and applications of bottlebrush polymers, see, e.g., Verduzco et al. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2015, 44, 2405-2420, and references cite therein; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "Extended release (also referred to as controlled release, sustained release, or time release) technologies allow for the slowed, steadied release of therapeutic agents over an extended period of time. Formulations for extended release of therapeutic agents (e.g., drugs) allow for less frequent dosing or administration, and therefore can increase patient compliance and convenience. Furthermore, implantable materials with extended release characteristics allow for the local administration of therapeutic agents for sustained release to a site of interest. For example, injectable or implantable gels with extended release properties can be administered to the eye of a subject to aid in healing after ocular surgery. As another example, injectable gels can be administered to a tumor site for localized and sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer.",
                        "Polymers are useful materials in extended release formulations due to their ability to organize into structures capable of encapsulating, carrying, and/or delivering therapeutic agents. For instance, polymers are known to organize to form particles, micelles, and hydrogels with interesting and attractive drug delivery characteristics, including extended release properties.",
                        "Injectable hydrogels based on polymer scaffolds have been reported for non-covalent loading of cargo of various ionic drugs, proteins, and RNAs, and hydrophobic small molecules. Generally, the therapeutic cargo diffuses out of the hydrogel and enters the extracellular matrix; the rate of release is controlled by carrier density and biodegradation. The drug release profiles in vivo from the hydrogels can be tuned by altering the underlying carrier design at molecular level. Of particular interest are polymer systems that are designed to exhibit stimulus-responsive behavior and provide control over the place and duration of drug release. Examples are drug-loaded hydrogels that are modulated or degraded by ECM enzymes, pH, and body heat. In the last group, heat-induced physical crosslinking of drug-loaded micelle solutions is underexplored field and can offer innovative ways of tuning the rate of drug diffusion from carrier hydrogel. New bottlebrush polymers with tunable properties are of great interest. In particular, new bottlebrush polymers capable of forming particles and/or hydrogels have important applications in medicine (e.g., drug delivery)."

Angiogenesis is a vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. However, angiogenesis is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one, leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer.

A neoplasm or tumor may be \u201cbenign\u201d or \u201cmalignant,\u201d depending on the following characteristics: degree of cellular differentiation (including morphology and functionality), rate of growth, local invasion, and metastasis. A \u201cbenign neoplasm\u201d is generally well differentiated, has characteristically slower growth than a malignant neoplasm, and remains localized to the site of origin.

Exemplary benign neoplasms include, but are not limited to, lipoma, chondroma, adenomas, acrochordon, senile angiomas, seborrheic keratoses, lentigos, and sebaceous hyperplasias. In some cases, certain \u201cbenign\u201d tumors may later give rise to malignant neoplasms, which may result from additional genetic changes in a subpopulation of the tumor's neoplastic cells, and these tumors are referred to as \u201cpre-malignant neoplasms.\u201d An exemplary pre-malignant neoplasm is a teratoma. In contrast, a \u201cmalignant neoplasm\u201d is generally poorly differentiated (anaplasia) and has characteristically rapid growth accompanied by progressive infiltration, invasion, and destruction of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, a malignant neoplasm generally has the capacity to metastasize to distant sites.

                                "A \u201cdiabetic condition\u201d refers to diabetes and pre-diabetes. Diabetes refers to a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger). There are several types of diabetes. Type I diabetes results from the body's failure to produce insulin, and presently requires the person to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump. Type II diabetes results from insulin resistance a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. Gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. Other forms of diabetes include congenital diabetes, which is due to genetic defects of insulin secretion, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of monogenic diabetes, e.g., mature onset diabetes of the young (e.g., MODY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10). Pre-diabetes indicates a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications. These typically develop after many years, but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time. The major long-term complications relate to damage to blood vessels. Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease and macrovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease (angina, myocardial infarction), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes also causes microvascular complications, e.g., damage to the small blood vessels. Diabetic retinopathy, which affects blood vessel formation in the retina of the eye, can lead to visual symptoms, reduced vision, and potentially blindness. Diabetic nephropathy, the impact of diabetes on the kidneys, can lead to scarring changes in the kidney tissue, loss of small or progressively larger amounts of protein in the urine, and eventually chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Diabetic neuropathy is the impact of diabetes on the nervous system, most commonly causing numbness, tingling and pain in the feet and also increasing the risk of skin damage due to altered sensation. Together with vascular disease in the legs, neuropathy contributes to the risk of diabetes-related foot problems, e.g., diabetic foot ulcers, that can be difficult to treat and occasionally require amputation.",

                                "One aspect of the present invention relates to triblock bottlebrush copolymers. In certain embodiments, the polymer is an ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprising a Block A polymer, a Block B polymer, and a Block C polymer. A triblock bottlebrush copolymer of the present invention comprises a backbone polymer of repeating units covalently linked to polymeric sidechains; wherein Block A, Block B, and Block C of the copolymer comprise polymeric sidechains covalently linked to the repeating units of the backbone polymer; and wherein at least one of Block A, Block B, and Block C comprises polymeric sidechains that exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. As described herein, each polymeric side chain of Block A is of the same polymer type, each polymeric side chain of Block B is of the same polymer type, and each polymeric side chain of Block C is of the same polymer type. Also, as described herein, Block A, Block B, and Block C comprise polymeric side chains which are of different polymer types. As a representative example, an outline of the general architecture of a triblock bottlebrush copolymer provided herein is shown in FIGS. 1B-1C.",
                                "A triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprising polymeric sidechains that exhibit LCST behavior may be thermally-responsive and capable of undergoing a phase transition at a particular temperature. Such a polymer would be useful, for example, as a thermally-responsive drug delivery vehicle. As defined herein, \u201clower critical solution temperature\u201d (LCST) is the temperature below which a polymer is miscible in a solvent. \u201cLCST behavior\u201d refers to a characteristic of a polymer wherein the polymer exhibits a lower critical solution temperature. For example, a polymer that exhibits LCST behavior is a polymer which is miscible in a solvent at or below a certain temperature (i.e., the polymer's LCST), and which may solidify or congeal (e.g., to form a solid or a gel) in solution at or above the certain temperature. A common polymer known to exhibit LCST behavior is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), which has a lower critical solution temperature of around 32\u00b0 C. PNIPAM is a useful in biomedical applications (e.g., in drug delivery) since it has a LCST close to physiological temperature (37\u00b0 C.). Other polymers that exhibit LCST behavior include, but are not limited to, poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEAAm) (LCST from 25 to 32\u00b0 C.), poly(N-vinlycaprolactam) (PVCL) (LCST between 25 and 35\u00b0 C.), poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDMAEMA) (LCST around 50\u00b0 C.), and polyethylene glycol) (PEG) (LCST of about 85\u00b0 C.).",
                                "In certain embodiments, the LCST of the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein is around physiological temperature (approximately 37\u00b0 C.). In certain embodiments, the LCST of the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein is around 33\u00b0 C. In certain embodiments, the LCST of the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein is between 30 and 40\u00b0 C., inclusive.",
                                "The triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein are ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymers, meaning that the polymeric sidechains of Blocks A, B, and C are different polymers. For example, no two of Blocks A, B, and C have the same polymer sidechains. \u201cDifferent polymer,\u201d as used herein, refers to different polymer composition (i.e., composed of different monomer subunits). In other words, the polymeric sidechains of Blocks A, B, and C each are of a different polymer class, or of a different polymer type. For instance, when each polymeric sidechain of Block A is independently a PLA polymer and each polymeric side chain of Block B is independently a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, the sidechains of A and B are considered to be different polymer types, of different polymer classes, and different polymers.",
                                "It is also to be understood that each polymeric sidechain of Block A are the same polymer, each polymeric sidechain of Block B are the same polymer, and each polymeric sidechain of Block C are the same polymer (i.e., composed of the same monomer subunits, i.e., of the same polymer type/class). However, any two polymeric sidechains of Block A, of Block B, or of Block C may be of the same or different length, or of the same or different molecular weight. \u201cSame polymer,\u201d as used here, refers to the same polymer composition (i.e., composed of the same monomers), and does not necessarily mean polymers of the same length, molecular weight, or structure. Polymers that are the \u201csame polymer\u201d can have different polymer lengths, molecular weight, terminal groups, etc. For instance, all of A are considered the \u201csame polymer\u201d if all of A are polylactic acid (PLA) side chains, even if each A is a PLA side chain has a different length and molecular weight.",

                                "The ABC bottlebrush copolymers exemplified are amphiphiles constructed from a hydrophobic segment of polylactic acid, PLA, and hydrophilic segment made of polyethylene oxide, PEG, followed by PNIPAM. At ambient temperature, the bottlebrush copolymers self-assemble into well-controlled micelles. It is documented that backbone rigidity of the bottle-brush amphiphiles allows for imperfect space filling in hydrophobic PLA microdomain. The micelles formed from such amphiphiles can therefore make encapsulation of hydrophobic molecules (i.e., drugs) more favorable thus increasing loading capacity and improving the thermodynamic stability of the micelles at the same time. See, e.g., FIGS. 1-3.",
                                "Furthermore, the bottlebrush architecture is uniquely positioned for realizing thermoresponsive amphiphiles because bottlebrush copolymers adapt into a fully extended conformation due to their high grafting density. Introduction of a PNIPAM segment at the periphery of amphiphiles promotes aggregation among micelles upon heating of the medium above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The rigid backbone of bottlebrushes prevent PNIPAM segment from internal collapse thus promoting efficient formation of PNIPAM microdomains that act as physical crosslinks. The physical crosslinking leads to formation of a micellular networks\u2014a hydrogel.",
                                "Lastly, bottlebrush amphiphiles offer yet another important advantage over commonly used linear counterparts. Linear multiblock copolymers are difficult to synthesize. Thanks to advent of ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) (see, e.g., FIGS. 17A-17C, as well as the synthetic procedures below) it is now possible to synthesize elaborate multiblock bottle-brush copolymers. Living nature of ROMP allows for sequential introduction of monomers. By tuning the monomer feed ratios, the size of each block can be controlled to confer desired properties of resulting micelles such as morphology, size, and drug loading drug loading capacity."

                                "**Targeted Delivery and Sustained Release of Anti-Cancer Agents**",
                                "Discovery of highly potent chemotherapeutic drugs for treatment of cancers have saved millions and improved patients' quality of life. While use of a single drug for treatment can in some cases result in emergence of resistance in cancers (adenoma lung, for example), combination therapies targeting dissimilar cellular pathways lead to higher rates of complete remission. However, efficacy of an approved small molecule anticancer medicines and immunomodulators, as well as of the drug candidates currently in clinical development is often restricted by several important limitations. To elicit their therapeutic activity, drug molecules need be in diseased tissue at sufficient concentrations for prolonged periods. Because of their low water solubility and short circulation life-times, many chemotherapeutics, such as SN-38 and PTX, are injected intravenously in repeated fashion, often in conjunction with an encapsulating agent to improve their solubility.",
                                "The systemic administration and importantly narrow therapeutic window, are associated with severe side-effects. Similar challenges are surfacing in promising field of immunochemotherapy that augments chemotherapeutics with body's own immune system to fight malignant cells. Antigens produced from cancer cells killed by chemotherapeutic are not processed efficiently by immune cells because of immune-suppressing microenvironment inside the tumors. Immunomodulators such as Resiquimod can stimulate immune cells to process tumor-specific antigens and recruit immune cells into fight against tumor. However, if administered systemically the immune modulators can lead to dramatic side effects collectively described as cytokine storm.",
                                "An ideal delivery system enables a single dose administration and maximize concentration of therapeutic at tumor site for prolonged periods, at the same time minimizing unwanted exposure to healthy tissues, thereby reducing serious side-effects. Covalent attachment of drugs via cleavable linkers to macromolecules that take advantage of enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) (BASP, Abraxane) or active targeting biomolecules have been shown to be promising delivery platforms that improve therapeutic window. However, in both approaches the vascularization at the tumor site plays an important role for efficient delivery. Conjugates are administered systemically and the cytotoxic drugs are successfully accumulated and released in tumor types with predominantly rich blood supply. An alternative to systemic dosing is use of drug-loaded delivery vehicles that can be directly injected at the tumor site allowing local drug release. Local administration is also desired for ophthalmologic treatments, as described above.",
                                "In context of immunotherapy is it has been shown that dosing immunomodulators such as cytokines at concentrations higher than optimal produces undesired effects as initial cytokine storm that can be followed by immune-numbing, where the immune cells become insensitive to activation. Hence, development of such combination therapies requires availability of smart vehicles for drug delivery that can maintain optimal concentrations of chemotherapeutics and immunodulators to achieve healing effects.",
                                "For example, a thermoresponsive three block bottlebrush copolymer (ABC) can serve as a versatile platform for local delivery of anticancer medicines. The ABC is an amphiphilic copolymer that self-assembles into micelles at room temperature enabling solvation of hydrophobic drugs into water and provides straightforward administration using a syringe for direct injection at the tumor site. Efficient loading of three widely used chemotherapeutics is achieved: Paclitaxel, Gemcitabine, and SN-38 (see FIG. 10). The drug-loaded ABC demonstrated rapid gelation when heated to 37\u00b0 C., and in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed formation of a local reservoir for sustained release of medicines (see, e.g., FIGS. 19-23). Intratumor injection of combination drug-loaded ABC hydrogel resulted in eradication of A549, human lung cancer cells, in mice (see, e.g., FIGS. 16A-16B). ABC hydrogels were further used in immunochemotherapy, delivering Paclitaxel and Resiquimod, an important immunomodulator, intratumorally to achieve significant inhibition in proliferation of aggressive colon cancer cells, CT-26 (see, e.g., FIGS. 11, 12, 15, 24). Furthermore, systemic and local side effects of immune-modulator use were minimized, corroborating the polymers' ability to provide controlled release of drug molecules. (see, e.g., FIGS. 13, 14)."
