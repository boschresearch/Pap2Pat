# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Bottlebrush polymers (also referred to a polymer brushes) are macromolecules comprising polymeric sidechains attached to a linear polymeric backbone. Bottlebrush polymers are types of branched or graft polymer, and have unique properties due to their highly branched structure. The high molecular weight and high sidechain grafting density typical of bottlebrush polymers can allow these macromolecules to self-assemble into well-defined structures with large domain sizes. Such properties give these polymers potential applications in, e.g., photonics, chromatography media, stimuli-responsive materials, lubricants, nanolithography, films, coatings, and drug delivery.

Bottlebrush copolymers are bottlebrush polymers comprising two or more different polymeric sidechains (i.e., two or more sidechains of different polymeric composition). These copolymers can be block copolymers, or copolymers wherein the polymeric sidechains are mixed and/or randomly dispersed. For a review on the structure, function, self-assembly, and applications of bottlebrush polymers, see, e.g., Verduzco et al. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2015, 44, 2405-2420, and references cite therein; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Extended release (also referred to as controlled release, sustained release, or time release) technologies allow for the slowed, steadied release of therapeutic agents over an extended period of time. Formulations for extended release of therapeutic agents (e.g., drugs) allow for less frequent dosing or administration, and therefore can increase patient compliance and convenience. Furthermore, implantable materials with extended release characteristics allow for the local administration of therapeutic agents for sustained release to a site of interest. For example, injectable or implantable gels with extended release properties can be administered to the eye of a subject to aid in healing after ocular surgery. As another example, injectable gels can be administered to a tumor site for localized and sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer.

Polymers are useful materials in extended release formulations due to their ability to organize into structures capable of encapsulating, carrying, and/or delivering therapeutic agents. For instance, polymers are known to organize to form particles, micelles, and hydrogels with interesting and attractive drug delivery characteristics, including extended release properties.

Injectable hydrogels based on polymer scaffolds have been reported for non-covalent loading of cargo of various ionic drugs, proteins, and RNAs, and hydrophobic small molecules. Generally, the therapeutic cargo diffuses out of the hydrogel and enters the extracellular matrix; the rate of release is controlled by carrier density and biodegradation. The drug release profiles in vivo from the hydrogels can be tuned by altering the underlying carrier design at molecular level. Of particular interest are polymer systems that are designed to exhibit stimulus-responsive behavior and provide control over the place and duration of drug release. Examples are drug-loaded hydrogels that are modulated or degraded by ECM enzymes, pH, and body heat. In the last group, heat-induced physical crosslinking of drug-loaded micelle solutions is underexplored field and can offer innovative ways of tuning the rate of drug diffusion from carrier hydrogel. New bottlebrush polymers with tunable properties are of great interest. In particular, new bottlebrush polymers capable of forming particles and/or hydrogels have important applications in medicine (e.g., drug delivery).

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thermally-responsive nanomaterials (e.g., particles, hydrogels) that provide extended release of one or more therapeutic agents are useful platforms for drug delivery, and thermally-responsive bottlebrush copolymers are macromolecules which can be used in the formulation of such materials.

In part, the present invention relates to new triblock bottlebrush copolymers which are useful in biomedical and other applications (e.g., photonics, chromatography media, stimuli-responsive materials, lubricants, nanolithography, films, coatings). In certain embodiments, the triblock bottlebrush copolymers described herein can be used in the formulation of particles and hydrogels useful in the extended release of one or more therapeutic agents, and can be administered to a subject to provide extended release of one or more therapeutic agents to the subject. In certain embodiments, the triblock bottlebrush copolymers, particles, and hydrogels described herein are thermally-responsive and gel at physiological temperature (e.g., upon administration to a subject), providing injectable and/or implantable gels (e.g., for controlled release drug delivery).

In one aspect, the present invention provides triblock bottlebrush copolymers (e.g., ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymers). An ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymer of the present invention comprises a backbone polymer of repeating units covalently linked to polymeric sidechains; wherein Block A, Block B, and Block C of the copolymer comprise polymeric sidechains covalently linked to the repeating units of the backbone polymer; and wherein at least one of Block A, Block B, and Block C comprises polymeric sidechains that exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. Lower critical solution temperature behavior is defined and described herein. In certain embodiments, at least one of Block A, Block B, and Block C comprises polymeric sidechains that exhibit an LCST around physiological temperature (approximately 37° C.).

In certain embodiments, one or more of Block A, Block B, and Block C of the triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprise polyester sidechains (e.g., polylactic acid sidechains). In certain embodiments, one or more of Block A, Block B, and Block C of the triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprise polyether sidechains (e.g., polyethylene glycol sidechains). As described herein, at least one of Block A, Block B, and Block C of the triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprises polymeric sidechains that exhibit LCST behavior (e.g., poly(N-alkylacrylamide) sidechains such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) sidechains).

Poly(N-isopropyl)acrylamide (PNIPAM) sidechains may be incorporated into the ABC bottlebrush copolymers described herein. In some instances, poly(N-isopropyl) acrylamide (PNIPAM) polymers form solutions that can be handled with ease at room temperature. When heated to above its lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32° C., PNIPAM undergoes a reversible sol-gel transition, turning into a gel. Because of their thermoresponsive behavior at biologically relevant temperatures, coupled with established biocompatibility, PNIPAM-containing polymeric structures are important thermoresponsive materials with medicinal applications.

In certain embodiments, a triblock bottlebrush copolymer of the present invention is of Formula (I):

wherein GA GB GC, L1, L2, L3, L4, LA, LB, LC, T1, T2, n, m, and p are as defined herein;

each of A, B, and C is independently a polymer;

wherein all of A are the same polymer, all of B are the the same polymer, and all of C are the same polymer;

provided that A, B, and C are different polymers; and

provided that at least one of A, B, and C is a polymer that exhibits LCST behavior.

“Same polymer,” as used here, refers to the same polymer composition (i.e., composed of the same monomer subunits). Polymers that are the “same polymer” can have different polymer lengths, molecular weight, terminal groups, etc. For instance, all of A are considered to be the “same polymer” if all of A are polylactic acid (PLA) side chains, even if each A is a PLA side chain with a different length and molecular weight. “Different polymer,” as used herein, refers to different polymer composition (i.e., composed of different monomer subunits). Polymers that are different are of a different polymer type and/or of a different polymer class. For instance, when each of A is independently a PLA polymer and each of B is independently a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, A and B are considered to be different polymer types, of different polymer classes, and different polymers.

In certain embodiments, the triblock bottlebrush copolymer of Formula (I) is a triblock bottlebrush copolymer of Formula (I-d):

wherein T1, T2, LA, LB, LC, A, B, C, n, m, and p are as defined herein.

In certain embodiments, one or more of group A, group B, and group C is a polyester (e.g., polylactic acid). In certain embodiments, one or more of group A, group B, and group C is a polyether (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol). As described herein, at least one of group A, group B, and group C of the triblock bottlebrush copolymer is a polymer that exhibit LCST behavior (e.g., poly(N-alkylacrylamide), such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)).

For example, in particular embodiments, a triblock bottlebrush copolymer provided herein is of the following formula:

wherein n, m, p, s, r, and q are as defined herein.

As another example, in another particular embodiment, a triblock bottlebrush copolymer provided herein is of the following formula:

As described herein, a triblock bottlebrush copolymer of the present invention may self-assemble to form a structure, such as a particle (e.g., micelle, nanoparticle). Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides particles (e.g., micelles, nanoparticles) comprising a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein. A particle described herein may contain one or more therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, the one or more therapeutic agents are small molecules (e.g., small molecule drugs). In certain embodiments, one or more of the therapeutic agents is selected from the group consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., ibuprofen), steroids (e.g., corticosteroids such as dexamethasone), and antibiotics (e.g., ofloxacin). The particles in certain embodiments comprise one or more anti-proliferative (e.g., anti-cancer) agents. Further examples of therapeutic agents and combinations thereof (e.g., three-way combinations, two-way combinations) are provided herein.

The triblock bottlebrush copolymers described herein, and the particles described herein, can self-assemble to form hydrogels. Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides hydrogels comprising a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein and/or a particle described herein. In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein undergoes a solution-gel (“sol-gel”) phase transition in response to a change in temperature. In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein undergoes a sol-gel transition at or around physiological temperature (approximately 37° C.). Since in certain embodiments a hydrogel described herein can gel at a temperature near physiological temperature, hydrogels of the present invention are particularly useful in biomedical applications, including, but not limited to, implants and/or extended-release vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic agents.

In another aspect, the present invention provides formulations comprising the triblock bottlebrush copolymers, particles, and hydrogels described herein; optionally one or more therapeutic agents; and optionally a carrier or excipient.

These and other exemplary substituents are described in more detail in the Detailed Description, Examples, and Claims. The invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the above exemplary listing of substituents.

### Other Definitions

The following definitions are more general terms used throughout the present application.

The term “polymer” refers to a molecule comprised of two or more (e.g., 10 or more) repeating units which are covalently bonded together. In certain embodiments, a polymer comprises 10 or more, 50 or more, 100 or more, 1000 or more, 2000 or more, or 4000 or more repeating units. In certain embodiments, a polymer comprises more than 4000 repeating units. The repeating units of a polymer are referred to as “monomers.” A “homopolymer” is a polymer that consists of a single repeating monomer. A “copolymer” is a polymer that comprises two or more different monomer subunits. Copolymers include, but are not limited to, random, block, alternating, segmented, linear, branched, grafted, and tapered copolymers. Polymers may be natural (e.g., naturally occurring polypeptides), or synthetic (e.g., non-naturally occurring). A polymer may have an overall molecular weight of 50 Da or greater, 100 Da or greater, 500 Da or greater, 1000 Da or greater, 2000 Da or greater, 5000 Da or greater, 10000 Da or greater, 20000 Da or greater, or 50000 Da or greater.

“Block copolymers” are copolymers comprising homopolymer subunits (i.e., “blocks”) covalently linked together. The blocks of a block copolymer are separated into distinct domains. A “diblock copolymer” is a block copolymer comprising two distinct homopolymer domains. A “triblock bottlebrush copolymer” is a block copolymer comprising three distinct homopolymer domains. Each distinct homopolymer domain of a block copolymer is of a different polymeric composition (e.g., comprising different repeating monomers). A triblock bottlebrush copolymer can be an “ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymer,” defined as a copolymer comprising three blocks (Block A, Block B, and Block C), each of which is a distinct homopolymer domain with a different monomeric subunit.

The terms “bottlebrush polymer” or “polymer brush” refer to a polymer comprising a polymeric backbone of repeating units, wherein the repeating units of the polymeric backbone are covalently linked to polymeric sidechains. In certain embodiments, each repeating unit of the polymeric backbone is linked to a polymeric sidechain. In bottlebrush copolymers, the entire polymeric backbone may be composed a single repeating backbone unit, and the blocks of the copolymer are defined by the composition of the polymeric sidechains. For example, in an ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymer, the polymeric backbone may be composed of a single unit that repeats throughout the entire backbone of the polymer, and each of Block A, Block B, and Block C of the triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprise polymeric sidechains of a different polymeric composition (e.g., comprised of different monomers). In other embodiments, a bottlebrush copolymer comprises more than one monomeric subunit in its polymeric backbone. The polymeric sidechains of a bottlebrush polymer or copolymer can be homopolymers or copolymers, and can have linear or branched architectures.

As used herein, “therapeutic agent” refers to any substance used as a medicine for treatment, prevention, delay, reduction or amelioration of a disease, condition, or disorder, and refers to a substance that is useful for therapy, including prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. A biologically active agent also includes a compound that increases the effect or effectiveness of another compound, for example, by enhancing potency or reducing adverse effects of the other compound.

In certain embodiments, a therapeutic agent is an anti-cancer agent, antibiotic, anti-viral agent, anti-HIV agent, anti-parasite agent, anti-protozoal agent, anesthetic, anticoagulant, inhibitor of an enzyme, steroidal agent (e.g., corticosteroid), steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), antihistamine, immunosuppressant agent, anti-neoplastic agent, antigen, vaccine, antibody, decongestant, sedative, opioid, analgesic, anti-pyretic, birth control agent, hormone, prostaglandin, progestational agent, anti-glaucoma agent, ophthalmic agent, anti-cholinergic, analgesic, anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, neurotoxin, hypnotic, tranquilizer, anti-convulsant, muscle relaxant, anti-Parkinson agent, anti-spasmodic, muscle contractant, channel blocker, miotic agent, anti-secretory agent, anti-thrombotic agent, anticoagulant, anti-cholinergic, β-adrenergic blocking agent, diuretic, cardiovascular active agent, vasoactive agent, vasodilating agent, anti-hypertensive agent, angiogenic agent, modulators of cell-extracellular matrix interactions (e.g. cell growth inhibitors and anti-adhesion molecules); or inhibitors/intercalators of DNA, RNA, protein-protein interactions, or protein-receptor interactions.

The term “small molecule” refers to molecules, whether naturally-occurring or artificially created (e.g., via chemical synthesis) that have a relatively low molecular weight. Typically, a small molecule is an organic compound (i.e., it contains carbon). The small molecule may contain multiple carbon-carbon bonds, stereocenters, and other functional groups (e.g., amines, hydroxyl, carbonyls, and heterocyclic rings, etc.). In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of a small molecule is not more than about 1,000 g/mol, not more than about 900 g/mol, not more than about 800 g/mol, not more than about 700 g/mol, not more than about 600 g/mol, not more than about 500 g/mol, not more than about 400 g/mol, not more than about 300 g/mol, not more than about 200 g/mol, or not more than about 100 g/mol. In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of a small molecule is at least about 100 g/mol, at least about 200 g/mol, at least about 300 g/mol, at least about 400 g/mol, at least about 500 g/mol, at least about 600 g/mol, at least about 700 g/mol, at least about 800 g/mol, or at least about 900 g/mol, or at least about 1,000 g/mol. Combinations of the above ranges (e.g., at least about 200 g/mol and not more than about 500 g/mol) are also possible. In certain embodiments, the small molecule is a therapeutically active agent such as a drug (e.g., a molecule approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as provided in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)). The small molecule may also be complexed with one or more metal atoms and/or metal ions. In this instance, the small molecule is also referred to as a “small organometallic molecule.” Preferred small molecules are biologically active in that they produce a biological effect in animals, preferably mammals, more preferably humans. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, radionuclides and imaging agents. In certain embodiments, the small molecule is a drug. Preferably, though not necessarily, the drug is one that has already been deemed safe and effective for use in humans or animals by the appropriate governmental agency or regulatory body. For example, drugs approved for human use are listed by the FDA under 21 C.F.R. §§ 330.5, 331 through 361, and 440 through 460, incorporated herein by reference; drugs for veterinary use are listed by the FDA under 21 C.F.R. §§ 500 through 589, incorporated herein by reference. All listed drugs are considered acceptable for use in accordance with the present invention.

A “protein,” “peptide,” or “polypeptide” comprises a polymer of amino acid residues linked together by peptide bonds. The terms refer to proteins, polypeptides, and peptides of any size, structure, or function. Typically, a protein or peptide will be at least three amino acids long. A protein may refer to an individual protein or a collection of proteins. Proteins, peptides, and polypeptides can contain natural amino acids and/or non-natural amino acids (i.e., compounds that do not occur in nature can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain). A protein or polypeptide may be a single molecule or may be a multi-molecular complex. A protein or polypeptide may be a fragment of a naturally occurring protein or peptide. A protein may be naturally occurring, recombinant, synthetic, or any combination of these.

The term “nucleic acid” (also referred to as “polynucleotides” or “oligonucleotides”) refers to a series of nucleotide bases (also called “nucleotides”) in DNA and RNA, and refers to any chain of two or more nucleotides. A nucleotide sequence typically carries genetic information, including the information used by cellular machinery to make proteins and enzymes. These terms include double- or single-stranded genomic and cDNA, RNA, any synthetic and genetically manipulated polynucleotides, and both sense and antisense polynucleotides. This includes single- and double-stranded molecules, i.e., DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA and RNA-RNA hybrids, as well as “protein nucleic acids” (PNAs) formed by conjugating bases to an amino acid backbone. This also includes nucleic acids containing carbohydrate or lipids. Exemplary DNAs include single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), plasmid DNA (pDNA), genomic DNA (gDNA), complementary DNA (cDNA), antisense DNA, chloroplast DNA (ctDNA or cpDNA), microsatellite DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or mDNA), kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), provirus, lysogen, repetitive DNA, satellite DNA, and viral DNA.

A “subject” to which administration is contemplated refers to a human (i.e., male or female of any age group, e.g., pediatric subject (e.g., infant, child, or adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult, or senior adult)) or non-human animal. In certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., primate (e.g., cynomolgus monkey or rhesus monkey), commercially relevant mammal (e.g., cattle, pig, horse, sheep, goat, cat, or dog), or bird (e.g., commercially relevant bird, such as chicken, duck, goose, or turkey)). In certain embodiments, the non-human animal is a fish, reptile, or amphibian. The non-human animal may be a male or female at any stage of development. The non-human animal may be a transgenic animal or genetically engineered animal. The term “patient” refers to a human subject in need of treatment of a disease.

The terms “composition” and “formulation” are used interchangeably.

The term “administer,” “administering,” or “administration” refers to implanting, absorbing, ingesting, injecting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing a compound described herein, or a composition thereof, in or on a subject.

The terms “treatment,” “treat,” and “treating” refer to reversing, alleviating, delaying the onset of, or inhibiting the progress of a disease described herein. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered after one or more signs or symptoms of the disease have developed or have been observed. In other embodiments, treatment may be administered in the absence of signs or symptoms of the disease. For example, treatment may be administered to a susceptible subject prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms and/or in light of exposure to a pathogen). Treatment may also be continued after symptoms have resolved, for example, to delay or prevent recurrence.

The terms “condition,” “disease,” and “disorder” are used interchangeably.

An “effective amount” of a compound described herein refers to an amount sufficient to elicit the desired biological response. An effective amount of a compound described herein may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the pharmacokinetics of the compound, the condition being treated, the mode of administration, and the age and health of the subject. In certain embodiments, an effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount. In certain embodiments, an effective amount is a prophylactic treatment. In certain embodiments, an effective amount is the amount of a compound described herein in a single dose. In certain embodiments, an effective amount is the combined amounts of a compound described herein in multiple doses.

The term “ocular condition” refers to any disease or condition involving the eye of a subject. Examples of ocular conditions include, accommodative dysfunction, amblyopia, astigmatism, blepharitis, cataract, chalazion, color vision deficiency, computer vision syndrome, conjunctivitis, convergence insufficiency, corneal abrasion, crossed eyes, diabetic retinopathy, dry eye, farsightedness, floaters and spots, glaucoma, hordeolum, hyperopia, keratitis, keratoconus, lazy eye, macular degeneration (e.g., age-related macular degeneration (AMD)), migraine with aura, myopia, nearsightedness, nystagmus, ocular allergies, ocular hypertension, ocular migraine visual disturbance, pinquecula, presbyopia, pterygium, ptosis, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, ocular cancers (e.g., retinoblastoma), strabismus, sty, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and uveitis.

A “proliferative disease” refers to a disease that occurs due to abnormal growth or extension by the multiplication of cells (Walker, Cambridge Dictionary of Biology; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, 1990). A proliferative disease may be associated with: 1) the pathological proliferation of normally quiescent cells; 2) the pathological migration of cells from their normal location (e.g., metastasis of neoplastic cells); 3) the pathological expression of proteolytic enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases (e.g., collagenases, gelatinases, and elastases); or 4) the pathological angiogenesis as in proliferative retinopathy and tumor metastasis. Exemplary proliferative diseases include cancers (i.e., “malignant neoplasms”), benign neoplasms, angiogenesis, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases.

The term “angiogenesis” refers to the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels. Angiogenesis is distinct from vasculogenesis, which is the de novo formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors. The first vessels in a developing embryo form through vasculogenesis, after which angiogenesis is responsible for most blood vessel growth during normal or abnormal development. Angiogenesis is a vital process in growth and development, as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. However, angiogenesis is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one, leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. Angiogenesis may be chemically stimulated by angiogenic proteins, such as growth factors (e.g., VEGF). “Pathological angiogenesis” refers to abnormal (e.g., excessive or insufficient) angiogenesis that amounts to and/or is associated with a disease.

The terms “neoplasm” and “tumor” are used herein interchangeably and refer to an abnormal mass of tissue wherein the growth of the mass surpasses and is not coordinated with the growth of a normal tissue. A neoplasm or tumor may be “benign” or “malignant,” depending on the following characteristics: degree of cellular differentiation (including morphology and functionality), rate of growth, local invasion, and metastasis. A “benign neoplasm” is generally well differentiated, has characteristically slower growth than a malignant neoplasm, and remains localized to the site of origin. In addition, a benign neoplasm does not have the capacity to infiltrate, invade, or metastasize to distant sites. Exemplary benign neoplasms include, but are not limited to, lipoma, chondroma, adenomas, acrochordon, senile angiomas, seborrheic keratoses, lentigos, and sebaceous hyperplasias. In some cases, certain “benign” tumors may later give rise to malignant neoplasms, which may result from additional genetic changes in a subpopulation of the tumor's neoplastic cells, and these tumors are referred to as “pre-malignant neoplasms.” An exemplary pre-malignant neoplasm is a teratoma. In contrast, a “malignant neoplasm” is generally poorly differentiated (anaplasia) and has characteristically rapid growth accompanied by progressive infiltration, invasion, and destruction of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, a malignant neoplasm generally has the capacity to metastasize to distant sites. The term “metastasis,” “metastatic,” or “metastasize” refers to the spread or migration of cancerous cells from a primary or original tumor to another organ or tissue and is typically identifiable by the presence of a “secondary tumor” or “secondary cell mass” of the tissue type of the primary or original tumor and not of that of the organ or tissue in which the secondary (metastatic) tumor is located. For example, a prostate cancer that has migrated to bone is said to be metastasized prostate cancer and includes cancerous prostate cancer cells growing in bone tissue.

The term “cancer” refers to a class of diseases characterized by the development of abnormal cells that proliferate uncontrollably and have the ability to infiltrate and destroy normal body tissues.

The term “inflammatory disease” refers to a disease caused by, resulting from, or resulting in inflammation. The term “inflammatory disease” may also refer to a dysregulated inflammatory reaction that causes an exaggerated response by macrophages, granulocytes, and/or T-lymphocytes leading to abnormal tissue damage and/or cell death. An inflammatory disease can be either an acute or chronic inflammatory condition and can result from infections or non-infectious causes. Inflammatory diseases include, without limitation, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), gouty arthritis, degenerative arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, psoriasis, cystic fibrosis, arthrosteitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, giant cell arteritis, progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, pemphigus, pemphigoid, diabetes (e.g., Type I), myasthenia gravis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, Goodpasture's disease, mixed connective tissue disease, sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, inflammatory dermatoses, usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), asbestosis, silicosis, bronchiectasis, berylliosis, talcosis, pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, giant cell interstitial pneumonia, cellular interstitial pneumonia, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, Wegener's granulomatosis and related forms of angiitis (temporal arteritis and polyarteritis nodosa), inflammatory dermatoses, hepatitis, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., poison ivy dermatitis), pneumonia, respiratory tract inflammation, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), encephalitis, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, hayfever, allergies, acute anaphylaxis, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, cystitis, chronic cholecystitis, ischemia (ischemic injury), reperfusion injury, allograft rejection, host-versus-graft rejection, appendicitis, arteritis, blepharitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, cervicitis, cholangitis, chorioamnionitis, conjunctivitis, dacryoadenitis, dermatomyositis, endocarditis, endometritis, enteritis, enterocolitis, epicondylitis, epididymitis, fasciitis, fibrositis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, ileitis, iritis, laryngitis, myelitis, myocarditis, nephritis, omphalitis, oophoritis, orchitis, osteitis, otitis, pancreatitis, parotitis, pericarditis, pharyngitis, pleuritis, phlebitis, pneumonitis, proctitis, prostatitis, rhinitis, salpingitis, sinusitis, stomatitis, synovitis, testitis, tonsillitis, urethritis, urocystitis, uveitis, vaginitis, vasculitis, vulvitis, vulvovaginitis, angitis, chronic bronchitis, osteomyelitis, optic neuritis, temporal arteritis, transverse myelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

The term “metabolic disorder” refers to any disorder that involves an alteration in the normal metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, or a combination thereof. A metabolic disorder is associated with either a deficiency or excess in a metabolic pathway resulting in an imbalance in metabolism of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and/or carbohydrates. Factors affecting metabolism include, and are not limited to, the endocrine (hormonal) control system (e.g., the insulin pathway, the enteroendocrine hormones including GLP-1, PYY or the like), the neural control system (e.g., GLP-1 in the brain), or the like. Examples of metabolic disorders include, but are not limited to, diabetes (e.g., Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, gestational diabetes), hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and obesity.

A “diabetic condition” refers to diabetes and pre-diabetes. Diabetes refers to a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger). There are several types of diabetes. Type I diabetes results from the body's failure to produce insulin, and presently requires the person to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump. Type II diabetes results from insulin resistance a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. Gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. Other forms of diabetes include congenital diabetes, which is due to genetic defects of insulin secretion, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids, and several forms of monogenic diabetes, e.g., mature onset diabetes of the young (e.g., MODY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10). Pre-diabetes indicates a condition that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications. These typically develop after many years, but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time. The major long-term complications relate to damage to blood vessels. Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease and macrovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease (angina, myocardial infarction), stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes also causes microvascular complications, e.g., damage to the small blood vessels. Diabetic retinopathy, which affects blood vessel formation in the retina of the eye, can lead to visual symptoms, reduced vision, and potentially blindness. Diabetic nephropathy, the impact of diabetes on the kidneys, can lead to scarring changes in the kidney tissue, loss of small or progressively larger amounts of protein in the urine, and eventually chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Diabetic neuropathy is the impact of diabetes on the nervous system, most commonly causing numbness, tingling and pain in the feet and also increasing the risk of skin damage due to altered sensation. Together with vascular disease in the legs, neuropathy contributes to the risk of diabetes-related foot problems, e.g., diabetic foot ulcers, that can be difficult to treat and occasionally require amputation.

### Triblock Bottlebrush Copolymers

One aspect of the present invention relates to triblock bottlebrush copolymers. In certain embodiments, the polymer is an ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprising a Block A polymer, a Block B polymer, and a Block C polymer. A triblock bottlebrush copolymer of the present invention comprises a backbone polymer of repeating units covalently linked to polymeric sidechains; wherein Block A, Block B, and Block C of the copolymer comprise polymeric sidechains covalently linked to the repeating units of the backbone polymer; and wherein at least one of Block A, Block B, and Block C comprises polymeric sidechains that exhibit lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. As described herein, each polymeric side chain of Block A is of the same polymer type, each polymeric side chain of Block B is of the same polymer type, and each polymeric side chain of Block C is of the same polymer type. Also, as described herein, Block A, Block B, and Block C comprise polymeric side chains which are of different polymer types. As a representative example, an outline of the general architecture of a triblock bottlebrush copolymer provided herein is shown in FIGS. 1B-1C.

A triblock bottlebrush copolymer comprising polymeric sidechains that exhibit LCST behavior may be thermally-responsive and capable of undergoing a phase transition at a particular temperature. Such a polymer would be useful, for example, as a thermally-responsive drug delivery vehicle. As defined herein, “lower critical solution temperature” (LCST) is the temperature below which a polymer is miscible in a solvent. “LCST behavior” refers to a characteristic of a polymer wherein the polymer exhibits a lower critical solution temperature. For example, a polymer that exhibits LCST behavior is a polymer which is miscible in a solvent at or below a certain temperature (i.e., the polymer's LCST), and which may solidify or congeal (e.g., to form a solid or a gel) in solution at or above the certain temperature. A common polymer known to exhibit LCST behavior is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), which has a lower critical solution temperature of around 32° C. PNIPAM is a useful in biomedical applications (e.g., in drug delivery) since it has a LCST close to physiological temperature (37° C.). Other polymers that exhibit LCST behavior include, but are not limited to, poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide) (PDEAAm) (LCST from 25 to 32° C.), poly(N-vinlycaprolactam) (PVCL) (LCST between 25 and 35° C.), poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDMAEMA) (LCST around 50° C.), and polyethylene glycol) (PEG) (LCST of about 85° C.).

In certain embodiments, the LCST of the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein is around physiological temperature (approximately 37° C.). In certain embodiments, the LCST of the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein is around 33° C. In certain embodiments, the LCST of the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein is between 30 and 40° C., inclusive.

The triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein are ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymers, meaning that the polymeric sidechains of Blocks A, B, and C are different polymers. For example, no two of Blocks A, B, and C have the same polymer sidechains. “Different polymer,” as used herein, refers to different polymer composition (i.e., composed of different monomer subunits). In other words, the polymeric sidechains of Blocks A, B, and C each are of a different polymer class, or of a different polymer type. For instance, when each polymeric sidechain of Block A is independently a PLA polymer and each polymeric side chain of Block B is independently a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, the sidechains of A and B are considered to be different polymer types, of different polymer classes, and different polymers.

It is also to be understood that each polymeric sidechain of Block A are the same polymer, each polymeric sidechain of Block B are the same polymer, and each polymeric sidechain of Block C are the same polymer (i.e., composed of the same monomer subunits, i.e., of the same polymer type/class). However, any two polymeric sidechains of Block A, of Block B, or of Block C may be of the same or different length, or of the same or different molecular weight. “Same polymer,” as used here, refers to the same polymer composition (i.e., composed of the same monomers), and does not necessarily mean polymers of the same length, molecular weight, or structure. Polymers that are the “same polymer” can have different polymer lengths, molecular weight, terminal groups, etc. For instance, all of A are considered the “same polymer” if all of A are polylactic acid (PLA) side chains, even if each A is a PLA side chain has a different length and molecular weight.

The triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein comprise a backbone polymer of repeating units (“backbone units”). The repeating backbone units of any two of Blocks A, B, and C may be same or different. Further, any two of Blocks A, B, and C may comprise the same or a different number of repeating backbone units. In certain embodiments, each of Blocks A, B, and C independently comprise 1 to 4000 repeating backbone units, inclusive.

provided that A, B, and C are different polymers; and

each of n, m, and p is independently an integer between 1 and 4000, inclusive.

In certain embodiments, each of A, B, and C is independently a polymer, wherein all of A are the same polymer, all of B are the same polymer, and all of C are the same polymer; provided that A, B, and C are different polymers; and provided that at least one of A, B, or C is a polymer that exhibits LCST behavior. In certain embodiments, A, B, and C are independently selected from the group consisting of polyesters, polyethers, and polyacrylamides; provided that A, B, and C are different polymers.

Additionally, the polyacrylamide group may be any polyacrylamide described herein.

As described herein, the triblock bottlebrush copolymers provided herein are ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymers, meaning that groups A, B, and C are different polymers. “Different polymer,” as used herein, refers to different polymer composition (i.e., composed of different monomer subunits). In other words, A, B, and C each are of a different polymer class, or of a different polymer type. For instance, when each of A is independently a PLA polymer and each of B is independently a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer, A and B are considered to be different polymer types, of different polymer classes, and therefore different polymers. However, as also described herein, each of A are the same polymer, each of B are the same polymer, and each of C are the same polymer (i.e., composed of the same monomer subunits, i.e., of the same polymer type/class). “Same polymer,” as used here, refers to the same polymer composition (i.e., composed of the same monomers). Any two of A, any two of B, or any two of C may be of the same or different length, or of the same or different molecular weight. Polymers that are the “same polymer” can have different polymer lengths, molecular weight, terminal groups, etc. For instance, all of A are considered the “same polymer” if all of A are polylactic acid (PLA) side chains, even if each A is a PLA side chain has a different length and molecular weight.

### Methods for Preparing Triblock Bottlebrush Copolymers

In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for preparing the triblock bottlebrush copolymers described herein. The methods comprise forming the triblock bottlebrush copolymer via a polymerization reaction or series of subsequent polymerization reactions, and any polymerization reactions known in the art may be employed. Examples of polymerization reactions include, but are not limited to, free-radical polymerization, cationic polymerization, anionic polymerization, and olefin metathesis polymerization (e.g., ring-opening metathesis polymerization (abbreviated “ROMP”)).

A method of preparing a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein may comprise two or more sequential polymerization steps. For instance, a first macromonomer may be polymerized to form a homopolymer. Then, the homopolymer can be polymerized with a second macromonomer to form a diblock copolymer. Then, the diblock polymer can be polymerized with a third macromonomer to form an ABC triblock bottlebrush copolymer.

Provided herein is a method of producing a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein, the method comprising the steps of:

(a) providing a first macromonomer comprising a first polymer and one or more reactive moieties;

(b) providing a second macromonomer comprising a second polymer and one or more reactive moieties;

(c) providing a third macromonomer comprising a third polymer and one or more reactive moieties;

(d) reacting the macromonomer provided in step (a) under conditions suitable to effect a polymerization reaction and yield a homopolymer;

(e) reacting the homopolymer in step (d) with the macromonomer provided in step (b) under conditions suitable to effect a polymerization reaction and yield a diblock copolymer;

(f) reacting the diblock copolymer in step (e) with the macromonomer provided in step (c) under conditions suitable to effect a polymerization reaction and yield a triblock copolymer.

In certain embodiments, the method of preparing a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein comprises one or more olefin metathesis polymerization steps (e.g., steps (d), (e), and/or (f)). In certain embodiments, the method of preparing a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein comprises one or more ROMP steps (e.g., steps (d), (e), and/or (f)). Ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is a olefin metathesis strategy for chain-growth polymerization that utilizes ring strain of cyclic olefins (e.g., norbornene or cyclopentane; or heterocyclic analogs thereof) to drive the polymerization reaction. For olefin metathesis polymerization, the one or more reactive moieties on the macromonomers are olefins. For ROMP reactions, the one or more reactive moieties are cyclic olefins (e.g., norbornene or cyclopentane; or heterocyclic analogs thereof).

Therefore, in certain embodiments, the method of producing a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein comprises steps of:

(a) providing a first macromonomer comprising a first polymer (e.g., a polymeric sidechain described herein) and one or more olefins (e.g., a cyclic olefin);

(b) providing a second macromonomer comprising a second polymer (e.g., a polymeric sidechain described herein) and one or more olefins (e.g., a cyclic olefin);

(c) providing a third macromonomer comprising a third polymer (e.g., a polymeric sidechain described herein) and one or more olefins (e.g., a cyclic olefin);

(d) reacting the macromonomer provided in step (a) under conditions suitable to effect a polymerization reaction and yield a homopolymer;

(e) reacting the homopolymer in step (d) with the macromonomer provided in step (b) under conditions suitable to effect a polymerization reaction and yield a diblock copolymer;

(f) reacting the diblock copolymer in step (e) with the macromonomer provided in step (c) under conditions suitable to effect a polymerization reaction and yield a triblock copolymer.

A “macromonomer” is a monomer comprising a polymer group (e.g., a polymeric sidechain described herein) and a reactive moiety (e.g., an olefin such as a cyclic olefin). In general, a macromonomer is a polymer comprising a reactive group that allows it to act as a monomer in a polymerization reaction. The reactive group may be anywhere on the polymer and may be at the end/terminus of the polymer chain. Macromonomers function as monomers in polymerization reactions and, after polymerization, are the repeating units in the larger triblock bottlebrush copolymer.

For example, in certain embodiments, macromonomers of the present invention are of the following formulae:

or salts thereof; wherein XA, XB, XC, AR, BR, CR, LA, LB, LC, A, B, and C are as defined herein. In the exemplary macromonomers shown above, the cyclic olefins represent reactive moieties and A, B, and C represent polymer groups.

In certain embodiments, the reactive moieties are cyclic olefins such as norbornene (or variants thereof). For example, in certain embodiments, macromonomers of the present invention are of the following formulae:

or salts thereof, wherein LA, LB, LC, A, B, and C are as defined herein. Further examples of macromonomers of the present invention are provided in the Examples below.

In order to effect a polymerization reaction to form a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein, macromonomers are reacted in the presence of a polymerization initiator. In certain embodiments, when polymerization reaction is an olefin metathesis polymerization reaction (e.g., ROMP), the polymerization initiator is a catalyst or promoter of olefin metathesis. In certain embodiments, a ROMP polymerization involves reacting macromonomers in the presence of a ruthenium complex. In certain embodiments, the ruthenium complex is what is known in the art as a Grubbs or Grubbs-Hoveyda catalyst. Examples of commercially available ruthenium complexes useful in the polymerization reactions described herein can be found on the internet (See, e.g., www.sigmaaldrich.com/chemistry/chemical-synthesis/technology-spotlights/metathesis.html).

In certain embodiments, a ruthenium complex useful in a ROMP reaction described herein is of the following formula:

wherein X is a halogen (e.g., Br) or hydrogen.

The triblock bottlebrush copolymers described herein, and the particles described herein, can self-assemble to form hydrogels. Therefore, in another aspect, the present invention provides hydrogels comprising a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein. The present invention also provides hydrogels comprising particles described herein (e.g., drug-loaded particles discussed above). The term “hydrogel” refers to a three-dimensional, hydrophilic polymer network which can absorb water or other fluids. A three-dimensional network forms in a hydrogel via the cross-linking of polymer chains through one or more interactions selected from ionic bonding, covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals interactions. The porous structure of hydrogels can be tuned by controlling crosslinking density. Due to the hydrophilicity of hydrogels, they are highly absorbent and are capable of containing over 90% water. Hydrogels can be responsive to external stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, or concentration of an analyte) and can undergo reversible solution-gel phase transitions (i.e., change phase) or volume phase transitions (i.e., change in volume or shape) in response to such stimuli.

In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein is “thermally responsive,” meaning the hydrogel undergoes a phase transition in response to change in temperature. In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein undergoes a solution-gel (“sol-gel”) phase transition in response to a change in temperature. A “sol-gel phase transition” is an event wherein the hydrogel goes from solution phase (i.e., dissolved in a solvent) to solid phase (i.e., forms a gel, or “gelates”). In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein undergoes a sol-gel transition at or around physiological temperature (37° C.). In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein undergoes a sol-gel transition between 30° C. and 40° C. For example, a hydrogel described herein may be in solution phase at a temperature below 30° C., but a gel at a temperature above 40° C. In a particular embodiment, a hydrogel described herein may be in solution phase at a temperature below approximately 37° C., but a gel at a temperature above approximately 37° C. Since a hydrogel described herein can gel at a temperature near physiological temperature, hydrogels of the present invention are particularly useful in biomedical applications, including, but not limited to, implants and/or extended-release vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic agents.

As described herein, hydrogels of the present invention can be used as drug delivery systems for the delivery of one or more therapeutic agents. Therefore, a hydrogel provided herein may comprise one or more therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein comprises one or more therapeutic agents dispersed throughout the hydrogel. In certain embodiments, a triblock bottlebrush copolymer provided herein is conjugated to one or more therapeutic agents to form a complex, and the complex forms a hydrogel described herein.

In certain embodiments, a hydrogel described herein provides extended release of the one or more therapeutic agents. Therefore, a hydrogel of the present invention may comprise one or more therapeutic agents. The therapeutic agents can be any therapeutic agents described herein. For example, in certain embodiments, one or more of the therapeutic agents is selected from the group consisting of antibiotics (e.g., ofloxacin), steroids (e.g., corticosteroids such as dexamethasone), and NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen). In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises an antibiotic. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises ofloxacin. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises an NSAID. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises ibuprofen. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises a corticosteroid. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises dexamethasone. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises two or more therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises three or more therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, the hydrogel comprises a steroid, an antibiotic, and an NSAID. In a particular embodiment, the hydrogel comprises dexamethasone, ofloxacin, and ibuprofen.

A hydrogel of the present invention is useful for the delivery (e.g., extended release delivery) of three or more therapeutic agents to a subject. For example, in a particular embodiment, a hydrogel of the present invention is useful for the delivery (e.g., extended release delivery) of an antibiotic (e.g., ofloxacin), a steroid (e.g., corticosteroids such as dexamethasone), and an NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen).

In a particular embodiment, a hydrogel provided herein is a thermally-responsive hydrogel (e.g., gels at or around physiological temperature) comprised of particles described herein, wherein the particles comprise a triblock bottlebrush copolymer described herein, and wherein the particles further comprise (e.g., encapsulate) one or more therapeutic agents (e.g., three or more therapeutic agents). The hydrogel may be comprised of particles encapsulating more than one therapeutic agent per particle; or alternatively, the hydrogel may comprise a mixture of particles encapsulating different therapeutic agents. For example, a hydrogel of the present invention may comprise particles encapsulating an antibiotic (e.g., ofloxacin), particles encapsulating an NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen), and particles encapsulating a steroid (e.g., dexamethasone).

## EXAMPLES

These and other aspects of the present invention will be further appreciated upon consideration of the following Examples, which are intended to illustrate certain particular embodiments of the invention but are not intended to limit its scope, as defined by the claims.

### Thermoresponsive ABC Bottlebrush Copolymer Amphiphiles

The ABC bottlebrush copolymers exemplified are amphiphiles constructed from a hydrophobic segment of polylactic acid, PLA, and hydrophilic segment made of polyethylene oxide, PEG, followed by PNIPAM. At ambient temperature, the bottlebrush copolymers self-assemble into well-controlled micelles. It is documented that backbone rigidity of the bottle-brush amphiphiles allows for imperfect space filling in hydrophobic PLA microdomain. The micelles formed from such amphiphiles can therefore make encapsulation of hydrophobic molecules (i.e., drugs) more favorable thus increasing loading capacity and improving the thermodynamic stability of the micelles at the same time. See, e.g., FIGS. 1-3.

Furthermore, the bottlebrush architecture is uniquely positioned for realizing thermoresponsive amphiphiles because bottlebrush copolymers adapt into a fully extended conformation due to their high grafting density. Introduction of a PNIPAM segment at the periphery of amphiphiles promotes aggregation among micelles upon heating of the medium above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The rigid backbone of bottlebrushes prevent PNIPAM segment from internal collapse thus promoting efficient formation of PNIPAM microdomains that act as physical crosslinks. The physical crosslinking leads to formation of a micellular networks—a hydrogel.

Lastly, bottlebrush amphiphiles offer yet another important advantage over commonly used linear counterparts. Linear multiblock copolymers are difficult to synthesize. Thanks to advent of ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) (see, e.g., FIGS. 17A-17C, as well as the synthetic procedures below) it is now possible to synthesize elaborate multiblock bottle-brush copolymers. Living nature of ROMP allows for sequential introduction of monomers. By tuning the monomer feed ratios, the size of each block can be controlled to confer desired properties of resulting micelles such as morphology, size, and drug loading drug loading capacity.

### General Methods and Instruments

All reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or VWR and used as supplied unless otherwise noted. Analytical high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data were obtained using an Agilent 1260 series HPLC system equipped with a variable wavelength ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) detector and an Agilent 6130 single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Separation was achieved using an Agilent Zorbox SB-C18 rapid resolution HT column with mobile phase gradients of 0.1% acetic acid in water and acetonitrile. Experiments were performed at room temperature with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using two Shodex KD-806M GPC columns connected in series with a DAWN EOS 18 angle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector (Wyatt Technology) and a T-rEX refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology). Experiments were performed at 60° C. using 0.2 M LiBr in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed on Bruker AVANCE-400 NMR spectrometer. MestReNova NMR 8.1.2-11880 software was used to analyze the NMR spectra.

An anhydrous toluene solution (60 ml) containing aminobutyric acid (2.0 g, 12.2 mmol) and cis-5-norbornene-exo-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride (1,320 mg, 12.8 mmol) was prepared in 100 ml round-bottom flask (attached with a Dean-Stark trap). Following 24 h reaction at 140° C. under oil bath, the reaction solution was transferred for purification by sequential extraction with 1 M HCl and brine. Note that the organic phase was collected and further subjected magnesium sulfate dehydration and filtration. The ultimate product of norbornene-butyric acid was obtained as a faint white solid by rotary evaporation.

Furthermore, the product of norbornene-butyric acid together with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, 1.86 g, 9.0 mmol), 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP, 72 mg, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (100 ml). The reaction solution was kept stirring for 30 min, followed by addition of anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) solution (10 ml) containing N-hydroxysuccinimide (1.03 g, 9 mmol) for 24 h reaction at room temperature. The product of norbornene-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS)-ester was purified by silica gel column chromatography (VEtOAc: Vhexanes=1:1) (780 mg, 38%) as a white-solid.

### Synthesis of Norbornene-PEG Macromonomer (Nor-PEG)

Following 24 h reaction at 140° C. under oil bath, the reaction solution was concentrated by rotary evaporator for silica gel column chromatography (VEtOAc:Vhexanes=1:1) (810 mg, 41%) as a white-solid.

### Synthesis of Norbornene-PLA Macromonomer (Nor-PLA)

A microwave vial containing anhydrous norbornene-propanol (205 mg, 1 mmol), lactide (5.76 g, 40 mmol) was vacuum dry for 3 h prior to reaction. After refill with nitrogen gas, the microwave vial was transferred for heating and stirred in a microwave reactor (incubation temperature starting from room temperature to 90° C.). By observing the melting into liquid phase, catalyst of Tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate [Sn(Oct)2] was injected into the reaction mixture under protection of nitrogen. Following 1 h reaction, the reaction was quenched in ice bath. The product was dissolved in DCM (15 ml). The ultimate product was purified by methanol precipitation for 3 times.

### Ring-Opening Metathesis (ROMP) Polymerization

In a glovebox, MM of n-PLA was dissolved in THF (0.05 M) in a vial with stir bar. A Grubbs III solution in THF (0.05 M) was prepared in a separate vial. Aliquot of catalyst solution was added into n-PLA solution. The ROMP was allowed to proceed for 1 h. The second MM of n-PEG was placed in a separate vial. The entire reaction solution of first romp was added to second MM. Following another 1 h reaction, the reaction solution was then added to the third MM of n-PNIPAM for 1 h reaction. One drop of ethyl vinyl ether was added to quench each polymerization. The solvent was removed in vacuo, followed by dissolving in DMSO. The solution was dropwise added into dH2O under vigorous stirring at 4° C. The entire solution was transferred to centrifugal filtration with MWCO 100 kDa under 2,000 RPM for 20 min. The purification process was repeated for 5 times. The ultimate product was obtained by lyophilization.

For other synthetic examples, see, e.g., FIGS. 17A-17C.

**Preparation of Drug/PLA-PEG-PNIPAM Particles**

The nanoprecipitation technique was employed for encapsulation of drugs into PLA-PEG PNIPAM formulated particles. Herein, the triblock polymer brush of PLA-PEG-PNIPAM (50 mg) and ibuprofen (50 mg) was separately dissolved in 100 μl DMSO. Then, aliquot of 10 μl ibuprofen solution was added to the entire PLA-PEG-PNIPAM solution, followed by dropwise addition of mixture into aqueous PBS (100 ml. pH 7.4) under vigorous stirring at 25° C. Following 30 min stirring, the samples was transferred to centrifugal filtration with MWCO 100 kDa under 2,000 RPM for 20 min. The filtration process was performed for 5 times by using PBS as elution carrier with aim of completely removal of DMSO. Ultimately, the particle fraction was collected with 3 times PBS washing, which was subjected to evaporation to obtain desirable concentration. The resulted formulation was characterized by DLS measurement. The drug loading efficiency was quantified by LC-MS measurement by comparing the ibuprofen concentration in the filtrate to the total feed ibuprofen. Furthermore, the same procedure of nanoprecipitation was followed to prepare dexamethasone/PLA-PEG-PNIPAM particle. A slightly modified procedure [merely using 100 mM NaHCO3 buffer (pH 10) to dissolve ofloxacin with respect to poor solubility of ofloxacin in DMSO] of nanoprecipitation was utilized to prepare ofloxacin/PLA-PEG-PNIPAM particle. See, e.g., FIG. 4. The solution of each obtained polymeric formulation solution, subjected to air-dry either at 25° C. or 37° C., was transferred to TEM measurement.

**Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Measurement**

The size and the polydispersity index (PDI) of diverse formulations, including blank PLA-PEG-PNIPAM formulation, ibuprofen loaded PLA-PEG-PNIPAM formulation, dexamethasone loaded PLA-PEG-PNIPAM formulation and ofloxacin loaded PLA-PEG-PNIPAM formulation at entire PLA-PEG-PNIPAM concentration of 1 mg/ml, were evaluated by DLS using Nano ZS (ZEN3600, Malvern Instruments, Ltd., UK). A He—Ne ion laser (633 nm) was used as the incident beam. Each sample (1 mL) was prepared and analyzed by the cumulant method to obtain the particle Z-average diameter and the PDI. The results were expressed as the mean of three independent measurements. See, e.g., FIGS. 5A-5B.

**Gelation**

The prepared nanoformulations were concentrated to a concentration of 100 mg/ml through centrifugal filtration through MWCO 100 kDa. Then, aliquot of each nanoformulation encapsulated by each drug were mixed at equal volume ratio. See, e.g., FIG. 6.

**Drug Releasing Profile**

The mixture of drug-encapsulated polymeric formulation (300 uL) was incubated in 2 mL PBS solution at 37° C. Aliquot of the eluted drug PBS medium (100 uL) was collected every 24 h for LC-MS measurement for quantification of drug release rate. Note, the collected volume was replaced with fresh buffer. See, e.g., FIG. 8.

**LDH Assay**

HUVEC were seeded in 24-well culture plates (20,000 cells/well) and incubated overnight in 400 μL MCDB131 containing 10% FBS and 10 ng/mL b-FGF. The medium was replaced with 400 μL of fresh medium, followed by addition of 30 μL sample h solution in PBS (133.3 mg/ml, 25° C.). After 72 h incubation at 37° C., the biocompatibility of the sample to HUVEC was investigated by quantification of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from the cells according to a LDH assay. As control, cells treated with jetPEI (1 mg/mL) and cell lysis buffer was also investigated. See, e.g., FIG. 9.

**Targeted Delivery and Sustained Release of Anti-Cancer Agents**

Discovery of highly potent chemotherapeutic drugs for treatment of cancers have saved millions and improved patients' quality of life. While use of a single drug for treatment can in some cases result in emergence of resistance in cancers (adenoma lung, for example), combination therapies targeting dissimilar cellular pathways lead to higher rates of complete remission. However, efficacy of an approved small molecule anticancer medicines and immunomodulators, as well as of the drug candidates currently in clinical development is often restricted by several important limitations. To elicit their therapeutic activity, drug molecules need be in diseased tissue at sufficient concentrations for prolonged periods. Because of their low water solubility and short circulation life-times, many chemotherapeutics, such as SN-38 and PTX, are injected intravenously in repeated fashion, often in conjunction with an encapsulating agent to improve their solubility.

The systemic administration and importantly narrow therapeutic window, are associated with severe side-effects. Similar challenges are surfacing in promising field of immunochemotherapy that augments chemotherapeutics with body's own immune system to fight malignant cells. Antigens produced from cancer cells killed by chemotherapeutic are not processed efficiently by immune cells because of immune-suppressing microenvironment inside the tumors. Immunomodulators such as Resiquimod can stimulate immune cells to process tumor-specific antigens and recruit immune cells into fight against tumor. However, if administered systemically the immune modulators can lead to dramatic side effects collectively described as cytokine storm.

An ideal delivery system enables a single dose administration and maximize concentration of therapeutic at tumor site for prolonged periods, at the same time minimizing unwanted exposure to healthy tissues, thereby reducing serious side-effects. Covalent attachment of drugs via cleavable linkers to macromolecules that take advantage of enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR) (BASP, Abraxane) or active targeting biomolecules have been shown to be promising delivery platforms that improve therapeutic window. However, in both approaches the vascularization at the tumor site plays an important role for efficient delivery. Conjugates are administered systemically and the cytotoxic drugs are successfully accumulated and released in tumor types with predominantly rich blood supply. An alternative to systemic dosing is use of drug-loaded delivery vehicles that can be directly injected at the tumor site allowing local drug release. Local administration is also desired for ophthalmologic treatments, as described above.

In context of immunotherapy is it has been shown that dosing immunomodulators such as cytokines at concentrations higher than optimal produces undesired effects as initial cytokine storm that can be followed by immune-numbing, where the immune cells become insensitive to activation. Hence, development of such combination therapies requires availability of smart vehicles for drug delivery that can maintain optimal concentrations of chemotherapeutics and immunodulators to achieve healing effects.

For example, a thermoresponsive three block bottlebrush copolymer (ABC) can serve as a versatile platform for local delivery of anticancer medicines. The ABC is an amphiphilic copolymer that self-assembles into micelles at room temperature enabling solvation of hydrophobic drugs into water and provides straightforward administration using a syringe for direct injection at the tumor site. Efficient loading of three widely used chemotherapeutics is achieved: Paclitaxel, Gemcitabine, and SN-38 (see FIG. 10). The drug-loaded ABC demonstrated rapid gelation when heated to 37° C., and in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed formation of a local reservoir for sustained release of medicines (see, e.g., FIGS. 19-23). Intratumor injection of combination drug-loaded ABC hydrogel resulted in eradication of A549, human lung cancer cells, in mice (see, e.g., FIGS. 16A-16B). ABC hydrogels were further used in immunochemotherapy, delivering Paclitaxel and Resiquimod, an important immunomodulator, intratumorally to achieve significant inhibition in proliferation of aggressive colon cancer cells, CT-26 (see, e.g., FIGS. 11, 12, 15, 24). Furthermore, systemic and local side effects of immune-modulator use were minimized, corroborating the polymers' ability to provide controlled release of drug molecules. (see, e.g., FIGS. 13, 14).
