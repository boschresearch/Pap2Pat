                                "Macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and other myeloid cells play important roles during acute and chronic inflammation. Pro-inflammatory myeloid cells stimulate cytotoxic T cells to suppress infectious disease and tumor growth, while immune suppressive myeloid cells promote tumor progression and wound healing. During acute and chronic inflammation, macrophages express pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as reactive nitrogen and oxygen species that can kill pathogens as well as normal cells. In contrast, in neoplastic and parasitic diseases, macrophages and immature monocytes and granulocytes (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) express cytokines that induce immune suppression, angiogenesis and cancer progression.",
                                "Macrophages isolated from murine and human tumors exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype that may be induced by cytokines expressed in the tumor microenvironment, such as IL-10 or TGF-\u03b2 which can induce M2-like macrophage polarization in vitro. The cytokine profile of the tumor microenvironment is therefore extremely important to the phenotype of the local macrophage. Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (mCSF) and its receptor CSF1R play important roles in macrophage and monocyte survival in vitro and in vivo, and CSF1R inhibitors are currently in clinical development for cancer therapy.",
                                "Although it is well established that tumor associated macrophages (TAM) are abundant within the tumor microenvironment and play essential roles in tumor immune suppression and tumor progression, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these tumor-promoting functions of TAMs remain incompletely clear. However, recent studies have shown that signaling pathways regulated by integrins, CSF1R, PI3K\u03b3 and BTK control myeloid cell trafficking into tumors as well as macrophage polarization and inhibitors of these molecules are also in clinical development for cancer therapy.",
                                "Myeloid cells as well as lymphocytes rely on cell adhesion receptors for trafficking into inflamed tissues and tumors. Previous studies on tumor inflammation revealed that immune cell adhesion receptors play critical roles during tumor progression. These studies found that myeloid cell integrin, \u03b1M\u03b22 (CD11b/CD18), a receptor for complement fibrinogen, and endothelial cell ICAM-1, is not required for adhesion to endothelium or trafficking into tumors. In contrast, CD11b/CD18 has been shown to mediate macrophage adhesion, migration, chemotaxis and accumulation during inflammation. Accordingly, a need exists for novel methods of treating cancer that focus on the role that integrin CD11b plays during inflammation."

Thus, in various embodiments, the promoter may be a stem cell-specific promoter that drives transgene expression. For example, constitutive promoters of different strengths can be used. Expression vectors and plasmids in accordance with the present invention may include one or more constitutive promoters, such as viral promoters or promoters from mammalian genes that are generally active in promoting transcription.

With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule.

These innate immune cells mount proinflammatory responses to pathogens and repair damaged tissues.

Preclinical studies have identified crucial pathways regulating the recruitment, polarization, and metabolism of TAMs during tumor progression.",
                        "It was previously reported that the VCAM receptor integrin \u03b14\u03b21 promotes myeloid cell recruitment from the bone marrow to the tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting immune suppression, angiogenesis and tumor progression2,13-15. In contrast to its role in regulating recruitment of myeloid cells to tissues during acute inflammation16-18, it was found that CD11b (\u03b1M \u03b22), a myeloid cell integrin receptor for ICAM-1 and fibrinogen, does not affect myeloid cell recruitment to tumors, as global deletion of CD11b in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice has no effect on the number of myeloid cells in circulation or in the number of cells recruited to tumors (FIGS. 6 and 7A-7D). Surprisingly, however, it was found that integrin CD11b plays an essential role in regulating macrophage polarization. Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibited enhanced immune suppressive gene and protein expression and strongly reduced pro-inflammatory gene and protein expression compared with WT macrophages, whether stimulated under basal, IL-4 or IFN\u03b3/LPS stimulation conditions (FIGS. 1A and 7E-7F).",

It was found that Itgam\u2212/\u2212 TAMs expressed significantly higher levels of mRNAs associated with immune suppression and angiogenesis, such as Arg1, Tgfb, Il10, Il6 and Pdgfb, and significantly lower expression of genes associated with immune stimulation, such as Ifng, Nos2, and Tnfa than did WT TAMs (FIGS. 1B and 7G).",
                        "Transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD11b in in vitro cultured macrophages elevated immune suppressive gene expression and decreased immune stimulatory gene expression, effects that are comparable to CD11 b deletion (FIG. 1C), indicating that even transient loss of CD11b controls macrophage immune suppressive gene expression. To address whether CD11b expression or function controls macrophage gene expression, the effect of inhibitory CD11b antibodies on macrophage mRNA expression was examined. Blockade of murine macrophage CD11b mediated attachment to ICAM-1-coated substrates by anti-CD11b neutralizing antibodies also induced immune suppressive mRNA expression in macrophages (FIG. 1D). Similarly, adhesion of macrophages to the integrin \u03b14\u03b21 substrate VCAM-1 or loss of attachment by suspension culture promoted murine and human immune suppressive transcription, while attachment to ICAM-1 coated surfaces promoted immune stimulatory transcription (FIGS. 1E and 1F), indicating that ligation of CD11b controls immune stimulatory macrophage transcription.",
                        "The loss of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages suggested that CD11b may regulate activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as NF\u03baB. It was found that Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibited reduced NF\u03baB serine 536 phosphorylation (an indication of reduced activation19) in response to LPS stimulation compared to WT macrophages, suggesting CD11b plays a role in NF\u03baB activation (FIG. 1G). As other studies have implicated CD11b in the promotion of pro-inflammatory responses of monocytes and dendritic cells through direct interactions of LPS with integrin beta2 extracellular domains20,21, the results provided herein indicate that CD11b activation and signaling play key roles in the regulation of macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo.",

To determine if this difference affects tumor growth, WT or Itgam\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow derived or tumor associated macrophages with tumor cells were adoptively transferred into recipient WT or Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice. It has been previously demonstrated that adoptively transferred, immune suppressive BMDM or TAMs can stimulate tumor growth9,10. Remarkably, bone marrow-derived Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (FIG. 1H) as well as tumor-derived Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (FIG. 10 potently stimulated tumor growth compared with WT macrophages in both WT and Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice. As Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibit an immune suppressive transcriptional profile (FIG. 1B), and tumors derived from Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit an overall immune suppressive transcriptional profile (FIG. 1J), these data suggested that CD11b expression or activation might impact overall tumor growth.",

As Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited substantially more CD4+Foxp3+Tregs and fewer CD8+ T cells in tumors than WT mice (FIGS. 8A-8B), the present data support the conclusion that CD11b plays a key role in regulating the overall immune response in tumors.",
                        "Prior studies have shown that Isoleucine 332 in the CD11b molecule serves as an allosteric switch controlling the adhesion receptor's activation and shape22. To determine whether CD11b activation controls tumor development, a constitutively activated CD11b knockin mouse strain (C57BL/6 ITGA-MI332G) was generated by introducing an I332G point mutation in the murine Itgam gene. I332G knockin mice express normal levels of cell surface CD11b on both monocytes and granulocytes and exhibit normal levels of all blood cell level (FIGS. 8C-8D). In vitro adhesion assays with bone marrow derived macrophages from these mice showed that I332G cells express constitutively active CD11b (FIG. 8E). Importantly, I332G Itgam knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced LLC tumor growth (FIG. 1K). Thus, while CD11b deletion stimulates anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization, inhibits CD8+ T cell recruitment and promotes tumor growth, CD11b activation potently inhibits tumor growth. These studies indicate that macrophage CD11b plays a critical functional role in controlling tumor growth.",
                        "To determine whether signals associated with the tumor microenvironment can alter CD11b expression and subsequently affect myeloid cell polarization, the effect of macrophage media (mCSF-, IL-4- and IFN\u03b3/LPS) on cell surface CD11b expression in bone marrow derived macrophages was evaluated. While the immune suppressive cytokine IL-4 reduced CD11b expression, the pro-inflammatory stimuli IFN\u03b3/LPS enhanced CD11b surface expression compared to levels expressed on mCSF-stimulated macrophages (FIGS. 9A-9B). Additionally, the immune suppressive factor TGF\u03b2, but not IL-10, inhibited CD11b surface expression (FIG. 9C); TGF\u03b2, IL-4 and tumor cell conditioned medium (TCM) each also suppressed Cd11b mRNA expression (FIG. 9D). Importantly, TGF\u03b2 and TCM reduced CD11b cell surface expression and stimulated immune suppressive transcription while inhibiting immune stimulatory transcription in a manner that was reversed by the TGF\u03b2R1 inhibitor SB525334 (FIGS. 9E-9G). These data indicate that cytokines such as TGF\u03b2 in the tumor microenvironment suppress CD11b expression or activation, thereby promoting immune suppressive macrophage polarization.",
                        "Macrophages not only control immune responses, but also induce angiogenesis and desmoplasia by expressing cytokines such as VEGF-A and PDGF-BB, growth factors that regulate endothelial cell and vascular smooth muscles/pericytes during angiogenesis, respectively2. Tumor blood vessels often consist of a single endothelial layer that lacks supporting pericytes or smooth muscle cells; these blood vessels are more numerous in tumors than in normal tissues but are aberrantly formed and poorly perfuse. In contrast, in tumors with high PDGF to VEGF ratios, blood vessels are lined by pericytes, mesenchymal cells that stabilize vessels and promote better tumor perfusion23-27. These tumors grow more rapidly than tumors with lower PDGF to VEGF ratios but also respond better to chemotherapy and immune therapy due to better tumor perfusion24-36. As Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibited high PDGF and low VEGF gene expression (FIGS. 1A and 1B), the patterns of blood vessel development in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 and WT tumors were examined. An assessment of vascular patterning in LLC and PyMT tumors from WT and Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice showed that Itgam\u2212/\u2212 tumors exhibited fewer, longer blood vessels with wider lumens and fewer branch points/field than WT tumors (FIGS. 2A, 2B and 10A). Itgam\u2212/\u2212 tumors had more blood vessels that were lined with Desmin+, NG2+, or SMA+ pericytes/smooth muscle cells than did WT tumors (FIGS. 2A-2C and 10B). Accordingly, these vessels were less permeable in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT mice, as less intravascular FITC-dextran leaked into the tumor parenchyma (FIGS. 2A-2D). These data indicate that the integrin CD11b plays a role in controlling blood vessel maturation.",
                        "It was found that protein and gene expression of PDGF-BB, but not VEGF-A, was strongly enhanced in tumors (FIGS. 2E and 10C). Importantly, PDGF-BB protein expression was also elevated in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 tumors and tumor-derived macrophages compared to WT tumors (FIG. 10F). Together, these data suggest that macrophage CD11b controls tumor vascularization through the constitutive expression of elevated levels of PDGF.",
                        "In support of these observations on CD11 b roles in neovascularization, it was found that Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited a well-developed retinal vascular plexus (FIG. 2B; Isolectin B+) at birth (P1) in contrast to WT mice, which exhibit undeveloped retinal vasculature that expands progressively from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P9. The superficial vascular plexus was more developed in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT neonates from postnatal day P1 through postnatal day P9 (FIG. 2G). These results indicate that CD11b also controls normal vascular patterning.",

Imatinib treatment suppressed the enhanced tumor growth and increased vascular normalization observed in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIGS. 2H-2I). Together these results indicate that CD11 b modulates vascular development through control of PDGF-BB expression.",
                        "CD11b may control anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization through the activation of transcription factors such as Stat3, which can promote expression of immune suppressive and pro-angiogenic factors such as Arginase 1, Myc, and VEGF37-39. Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibit constitutively phosphorylated Stat3 (FIG. 3A, inset); the high levels of immune suppressive factor expression in Itfam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages were reduced to WT macrophage levels by treatment with the Stat3 inhibitor 5,15-DPP (FIG. 3A). Surprisingly, Stat3 inhibition did not affect the high levels of Il6 expression observed in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (FIG. 3A).",
                        "Importantly, IL-6 can directly activate Stat338. It was found that IL-6 promoted the same pattern of immune suppressive polarization in murine and human myeloid cells and macrophages that was observed in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (FIG. 3B). Together, these results suggested that autocrine IL6 may drive the constitutively immune suppressive polarization observed in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. In support of this concept, Il6 knockdown decreased expression of constitutive Pdgfb expression in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (FIG. 3C). As TAMs are a major source of Il6 expression in tumors15, these results suggest that CD11b serves as a natural brake on immune suppression in part through control of myeloid cell transcription of Il6.",

The Let7 family of miRNAs has been shown to control Il6 expression in tumor and inflammatory cells40,41.",
                        "It was found that miRNA Let7a expression inversely correlated with Il6 expression in murine and human macrophages (FIGS. 11A-11B). As such, it was determined whether loss of CD11b expression in macrophages affects Let7a expression. Let7a expression was ablated in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 and Itgam siRNA transduced macrophages and in the presence of neutralizing CD11b antibodies (FIGS. 3D and 11C) in a manner that was independent of Lin28, an RNA binding protein that cleaves and inactivates Let7, as Lin28 levels were not affected by CD11b expression or activation (FIGS. 11B, 11D and 11E). CD11b ligation by ICAM-1 promoted time-dependent Let7a expression, while inhibiting Il6 expression; conversely, suppression of adhesion inhibited Let7a expression and promoted Il6 expression in both murine and human macrophages (FIGS. 3E and 3F). Importantly, ectopic expression of Let7a miRNA (pre-miRNA) inhibited immune suppressive gene expression and stimulated pro-inflammatory gene expression in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages, while anti-miRNA Let7a stimulated immune suppressive gene expression and inhibited immune stimulatory gene expression in WT macrophages (FIG. 3G). Similar to CD11b ablation (FIG. 1A), anti-miRNA Let7a stimulated Pdgfb expression, but had no effect on Vegfa expression (FIG. 3H). Together, these results indicate that CD11b activation promotes miRNA Let7a expression, which in turn inhibits immune suppressive macrophage gene expression.",
                        "c-Myc, a transcription factor that regulates basal and immune suppressive macrophage metabolism, binds to the Let7 promoter and suppresses Let7 transcription; interestingly, Let7 can also suppress c-Myc expression44,45. It was found that c-Myc gene was upregulated in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages compared with WT macrophages (FIG. 3I). c-Myc protein expression and serine 62 phosphorylation, which stabilizes the transcription factor46, were also upregulated in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages compared with WT macrophages (FIG. 3J). It was then asked whether inhibition of cMyc function could promote Let7 expression and thereby alter macrophage polarization. Importantly, Let7a, Let7d, and Let7f expression was reduced in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages; however, pharmacological inhibition of c-Myc restored Let7 expression in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages and reversed the increased immune suppressive gene expression exhibited by Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (FIGS. 3K and 3L). Together, these data indicate that integrin CD11b functions to suppress Myc expression and immune suppressive macrophage polarization in a Let7 dependent manner.",

Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages stimulated sprout elongation that was inhibited by transduction of macrophages with Let7a miRNA or Pdgfb siRNA (FIGS. 4A, 4B and 11F). In contrast, expression of anti-miRNA Let7a in WT but not Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages stimulated sprout elongation (FIGS. 4A, 4B and 11F). Additionally, macrophages transduced with anti-miR Let7a stimulated the formation of mature, pericyte-coated blood vessels in bFGF-saturated Matrigel in vivo (FIG. 4C). Together, these studies show that CD11b controls neovascularization through the regulation of Let7a and subsequent PDGF-BB expression.",
                        "To test the role of Let7a in the regulation of tumor immune suppression and neovascularization, anti-miR Let7a was delivered to tumors in targeted nanoparticles in vivo (FIG. 4D). It was found that integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted particles were specifically taken up by circulating myeloid cells in normal and tumor bearing animals (FIGS. 12A-12H). Delivery of anti-miRNA Let7a stimulated LLC tumor growth, comparable to that observed in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 4D). Although Let7a is expressed in immune and non-immune cells in tumors, it was found that delivery of anti-miR Let7a only inhibited Let7a expression in circulating monocytes and tumor associated macrophages but not in other tumor associated cells (FIG. 4E). Importantly, anti-miRNA Let7a stimulated immune suppressive and pro-angiogenic gene expression and inhibited pro-inflammatory gene expression in tumors compared with controls (FIGS. 4F and 13A). Anti-miRNA Let7a also stimulated blood vessel normalization in transfected tumors, as vessels were longer, less branched, heavily coated with pericytes and less leaky than vessel from control transfected tumors (FIGS. 4G and 4H). Anti-Let7a also suppressed CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors and enhanced CD4+ T cell recruitment to tumors (FIG. 4I). Together, these results indicate that CD11b restrains immune suppression and vascular maturation through its regulation of miRNA Let7a.",
                        "Thus, the methods of treating cancer may include administering to the subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of miRNA Let7a. It should be understood that such methods may also include administering a therapeutically effective amount of an agonist of CD11b expression in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of miRNA Let7a. Such compounded treatment regimens may include administering the agonist of CD11b expression first, followed by the therapeutically effective amount of miRNA Let7a, or vice versa. In various embodiments, both the agonist of CD11b expression and the miRNA Let7a are administered simultaneously.",
                        "Advances in basic, translational, and clinical research have revealed the power of cancer immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-programmed death (PD)-1, anti-PD ligand l(PD-L1), anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)4 antibodies, which suppress the functions of T cell inhibitory receptors (immune checkpoints), and chimeric antigen T cell receptor (CAR-T) therapies are therapeutic strategies that can increase the content of activated, tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in various tumors. Currently, approved checkpoint inhibitors for cancer therapy include pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and cemiplimab (anti-PD-1); atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab (anti-PD-L1); and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). However, many cancer patients have exhibited resistance to immunotherapies, with ongoing research indicating that resistance to checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive T cell immunotherapies can be mediated by abundant tumor-associated myeloid cell infiltrates, including macrophages, monocytes, and granulocytes.",
                        "Prior studies have shown that increased vascular normalization in tumors can improve tumor perfusion and promote responsiveness to therapy23-36. To determine whether the vascular normalization induced by anti-miRNA Let7a might enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by increasing tumor perfusion, mice bearing LLC tumors were treated with targeted delivery of anti-miRNA Let7a or control miRNA in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine) (FIG. 4J).",
                        "Chemically, gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog in which the hydrogen atoms on the 2\u2032 carbon of deoxycytidine are replaced by fluorine atoms. As with analogues of pyrimidines, the triphosphate analogue of gemcitabine replaces one of the building blocks of nucleic acids, in this case cytidine, during DNA replication. The process has been shown to arrest tumor growth, as only one additional nucleoside can be attached to the \u201cfaulty\u201d nucleoside, resulting in apoptosis.",
                        "Whereas anti-miRNA Let7a promoted LLC tumor growth, anti-miRNA Let7a combined with gemcitabine substantially reduced tumor growth, consistent with the notion that Let7a inhibition increases accessibility of the tumor to chemotherapy (FIG. 4K). In accordance with these results, it was found that gemcitabine treatment of Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice suppressed tumor growth more profoundly than gemcitabine treatment of WT mice (FIG. 13B). As Itgam\u2212/\u2212 exhibited greater perfusion (less vascular leak) than WT mice (FIG. 13C), these studies indicate that CD11b, through its effects on miRNA Let7a, plays a critical role in regulating tumor immune and vascular responses.",
                        "The results provided herein suggested that targeted pharmacologic activation of CD11b in vivo can repolarize tumor associated macrophages, with subsequent inhibition of tumor immune suppression and tumor growth. The effects of a small molecule agonist of CD11b, leukadherin 1 (LA1)47,48 (FIG. 5A) were then investigated on macrophage polarization and tumor growth. LA1 stimulated myeloid cell adhesion to ICAM-1 coated substrates in a manner that is inhibited by anti-CD11b-neutralizing antibodies (FIG. 5B). LA1 stimulated macrophage immune response gene expression, illustrated by increases in expression of Il1b, Tnfa, Il12, Nos2 and Ifng mRNAs (FIG. 14A). As LA1 stimulated Let7a expression and inhibited Pdgfb and Il6 expression (FIG. 5C), these results suggest that LA1 might stimulate pro-inflammatory immune responses that could inhibit tumor growth in vivo.",
                        "Thus, in another aspect, the methods of treating cancer in a subject may also include administering a therapeutically effective amount of (i) one or more of an agonist of CD11b activity or expression, such as LA1 and anti-miRNA Let7a, in combination with (ii) one or more chemotherapeutic agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors for cancer therapy.",
                        "To assess the effects of LA1 on tumor associated macrophages in vivo, tumor associated macrophages were isolated10, treated with LA1 prior and co-implanted with LLC tumor cells. LA1-treated macrophages completely inhibited tumor growth (FIGS. 5D and 5E) even though LA1 had no direct effect on LLC or macrophage viability (FIGS. 5E and 5F). Although LA1 had no effect on CL66-Luc breast tumor cell growth in vitro (FIG. 14B), LA1 potently reduced tumor growth in syngeneic, orthotopically implanted CL66-Luc breast tumors more effectively than taxol (FIG. 5G). LA1 also synergized with irradiation to suppress CL66-Luc breast tumor growth (FIG. 5H) and suppressed the growth of orthotopic, human MDA-MB-231 mammary xenograft tumors (FIG. 5I). It was observed that LA1 inhibited murine LLC lung tumor growth in WT but not in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that LA1 acts through integrin CD11b to suppress the growth of tumors (FIGS. 5J and 5K).",
                        "As LA1 treatment increased the presence of MHCII+ macrophages, typically considered immune suppressive, in LLC and CL66-Luc tumors (FIGS. 14C-14D), these studies suggest that LA1 repolarizes tumor associated macrophages. It was found that LA1 inhibited expression of S100A8 and MMP9 in CD11b+ cells in LLC tumors and also inhibited expression of Arginasel, S100A8 and MMP9 in CL66-Luc tumors (FIGS. 14E-14F). As these proteins are markers of pro-tumoral macrophages, together these studies indicate that LA1 likely inhibits tumor growth by repolarizing tumor associated macrophages. Indeed, LA1 treatment increased the presence of CD8+ T cells in both LLC and CL66-Luc tumors (FIGS. 15A-15C). It was also observed that LA1 treatment altered neovascularization in tumors by decreasing the numbers of SMA+ blood vessels (FIG. 5L). By enhancing the pro-inflammatory immune profile of tumors and inhibiting vascular normalization in tumors, the small molecule CD11b agonist LA1 significantly altered macrophage polarization, increased CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors and inhibited tumor progression in mouse models of murine and human cancer.",
                        "As described above, macrophage integrin CD11b was identified as a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory immune responses that prevent cancer progression. These studies demonstrate that CD11b ligation/activation inhibits the immune suppressive transcriptional signature of tumor-derived macrophages, stimulates accumulation of CD8+ T cells in tumors and suppresses tumor growth. Loss of CD11b expression or function promotes immune suppressive gene expression in macrophages in vitro and TAMs in vivo, increases FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells and decreases CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors and increases tumor growth. In contrast, activation of CD11b with the small molecule agonist LA1 stimulates macrophage pro-inflammatory transcription and anti-tumor immunity to inhibit tumor progression in animal models of cancer.",
                        "Using Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice, as well as knockdown and neutralizing antibody approaches, the data presented herein demonstrates that integrin CD11b is not required for myeloid cell trafficking during tumor growth, although other studies have shown CD11b regulates myeloid cell recruitment under conditions of acute inflammation.17,18 These differences may arise from the unique microenvironmental cues and alterations in blood vessel biology observed in tumors versus inflamed tissue. Recent studies have shown that signaling pathways regulated by TLRs, CSF1R, PI3K\u03b3 and BTK control macrophage polarization. Here, CD11b has been shown to promote miRNA Let7a and inhibit Myc expression to control macrophage polarization and tumor immune responses (FIG. 5M). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that agonists of macrophage integrin CD11b could provide benefit in the treatment of cancer.",
                        "Improved vascular perfusion in CD11b\u2212/\u2212 animals was observed. Compared to non-pathological tissue, tumors display disorganized, and immature blood vessel structures. Tumor blood vessels often consist only of a single fenestrated endothelial layer and lack the additional coverage of mesenchymal cells, such as pericytes and smooth muscle cells, which provide blood vessels with a stable and more mature structure that promotes tumor perfusion and better access to chemotherapy23-36. In these studies, tumor blood vessels from CD11b\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed increased pericyte coverage and increased vascular flow compared to WT. Indeed, deletion of CD11b or Let7a suppression increased the PDGF-BB/VEGF-A ratio, resulting in tumors with normalized vessels that stimulate tumor growth but are susceptible to cancer chemotherapy.",
                        "Integrin CD11b\u2212/\u2212 macrophages expressed increased levels of IL-6 that induced the expression of STAT3-dependent immunosuppressive cytokines. Decreased integrin CD11b expression or activation negatively regulated the expression of miRNA Let-7a in macrophages, thereby upregulating intracellular Il6 levels in macrophages. Reduced Let-7a expression is associated with malignant transformation of cancer cells and poor prognosis in cancer40,41. It was found that loss of CD11b down-regulates Let7a, leading to elevated Il6 levels and increased activation of STAT3, which were critical for the expression of M2-related cytokines. In contrast, recent studies showed that miRNA Let 7d-5p and DICER promote the M2 phenotype42. Together, these studies demonstrate the critical roles that miRNA species play in the polarization of macrophages and cancer growth.",
                        "As demonstrated herein, loss of Let7 expression in CD11b\u2212/\u2212 macrophages induces Myc expression; Myc then drives immune suppressive transcription and inhibition of immune stimulatory transcription. Although both Myc and NF\u03baB are transiently activated in WT IFN\u03b3/LPS stimulated macrophages, NF\u03baB activation is inhibited and Myc is activated in IFN\u03b3/LPS stimulated Itgam\u2212/\u2212 macrophages, leading to blockade of immune stimulatory transcription. These results suggest that Myc may inactivate NF\u03baB in macrophages, thereby contributing to immune suppression and enhanced tumor growth.",
                        "As discussed above, it was found that LA1, a potent activator of integrin CD11b/CD18 in vitro and in vivo42, could significantly alter macrophage polarization, increase CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors, inhibit tumor progression and prolong survival in mouse models of cancer. To determine the role of macrophage CD11 b activation in tumor growth, adoptive transfer of LA1 treated macrophages was performed; LA1 treated macrophages directly and robustly inhibited tumor growth. LA1 effects were lost in Itgam\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that the effects of LA1 on tumor growth depend on intact CD11b. These results indicate that LA1 acts on myeloid cells to effect changes in macrophage polarization, vasculogenesis and T cell recruitment. As LA1 has also been shown to inhibit bone marrow derived cell trafficking to tissues by promoting stable adhesion to endothelium. It is possible that LA1 may inhibit immune suppressive myeloid cell trafficking to tumors49. By slowing tumor progression, LA1 may also be useful to suppress the spread of cancer through metastasis.",
                        "LA1 was shown to stimulate a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages in vitro and in vitro. To address the direct impact of LA1 treated TAMs on tumor growth, we performed adoptive transfer of LA1 treated TAMs with tumor cells. It was found that LA1 treatment of TAMs robustly and rapidly abolished tumor growth. In this model, it was previously shown that adoptive transfer of immune suppressive macrophages (IL-4 stimulated) or TAMs promotes tumor growth, while adoptive transfer of immune stimulatory macrophages (IFN\u03b3/LPS stimulated) and repolarized TAMs) recruited CD8+ T cells to tumors and rapidly abolished tumor growth10. It was further shown that this tumor suppression by adoptively transferred macrophages required IL-12, a pro-inflammatory factor that recruits and stimulates CD8+ T cell proliferation10. Thus, this evidence supports that LA1 repolarizes TAMs, leading to recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells. As systemic delivery of LA1 also recruits CD8+ T cells and repolarizes TAMs in tumor models, these studies indicate that CD11b agonism by LA1 repolarizes macrophages and stimulates an adaptive immune response.",
                        "The role of T cell depletion was tested in the response to LA1 treatment by implanting MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells in SCID mice, which lack T cells. By comparison, CL66 Luc breast tumor cells were implanted in syngeneic, immune competent mice. Interestingly, LA1 inhibited MDA-MB-231 tumor growth to 50% of that of control treated animals. In contrast, LA1 inhibited CL66 Luc tumor growth to 25% of that of control tumors. LA1 also repolarized macrophages by stimulating MHCII expression and reducing CD206, Arg1, MMP9 and S100A8 expression in TAMs and promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment in this model. Together, these results indicate that LA1 acts on myeloid cells to change tumor associated macrophage polarization leading to increased T cell recruitment, and T cell dependent tumor suppression.",
                        "However, the partial effect of LA1 on MDA-MB-231 tumors indicates that LA1 (and hence CD11b) also affects T cell independent processes to suppress tumor growth. It was shown that LA1 reduced inhibiting vascular normalization (as detected by pericyte coated blood vessel density) in all tumor models. These studies indicate that CD11b controls innate immune cell polarization and that these cells regulate vascular as well as adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Together, these results indicate that CD11 activation controls tumor macrophage polarization, vasculogenesis and T cell recruitment.",
