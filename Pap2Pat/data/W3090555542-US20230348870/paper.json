    "abstract": "Delivery of therapeutic transgenes with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for treatment of myopathies has yielded encouraging results in animal models and early clinical studies. Although certain AAV serotypes efficiently target muscle fibers, transduction of the muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells, is less studied. Here, we used a Pax7nGFP;Ai9 dual reporter mouse to quantify AAV transduction events in satellite cells. We assessed a panel of AAV serotypes for satellite cell tropism in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and observed the highest satellite cell labeling with AAV9 following local or systemic administration. Subsequently, we used AAV9 to interrogate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of satellite cells in the Pax7nGFP;mdx mouse. We quantified the level of gene editing using a Tn5 transposon-based method for unbiased sequencing of editing outcomes at the Dmd locus. We also found that muscle-specific promoters can drive transgene expression and gene editing in satellite cells. Lastly, to demonstrate the functionality of satellite cells edited at the Dmd locus by CRISPR in vivo, we performed a transplantation experiment and observed increased dystrophin-positive fibers in the recipient mouse. Collectively, our results confirm that satellite cells are transduced by AAV and can undergo gene editing to restore the dystrophin reading frame in the mdx mouse.",

                "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating genetic disease that affects 1 in 5,000 live male births and is characterized by the lack of functional dystrophin protein, resulting in progressive lethal skeletal muscle degeneration.1 Skeletal muscle degeneration stimulates the satellite stem cell population to proliferate and give rise to new myofibers. In DMD, satellite cells are overwhelmed by the constant demand for muscle regeneration. Excessive proliferation results in replicative senescence, and the satellite cell regenerative capacity gradually declines, giving way to relentless muscle degeneration accompanied by fibrosis and adipose deposition.2 Although clinical advancements have been made for treatment of this disease, a cure remains to be developed.3 Due to its genetic nature, DMD is an excellent candidate for therapeutic gene editing,4 and several groups have recently demonstrated successful CRISPR/Cas9-based correction of the dystrophin gene in animal models.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 To deliver CRISPR/Cas9 to the muscle, gene-editing constructs are most commonly packaged in adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), which are effective gene-delivery vectors used in over 100 clinical trials with three approved therapies in the United States or Europe.12 Because satellite cells continuously replenish skeletal muscle in response to tissue damage, the genetic correction of a population of these self-renewing cells could generate a sustained source of therapeutic gene production. In fact, because episomal AAV vectors are lost by dilution following cell division,13 permanent correction of the genomic copy of mutated genes in satellite cells is a particularly compelling advantage of gene-editing technologies. Furthermore, efficient targeting of satellite cells with AAV vectors in\u00a0vivo would enable many studies of the function and regulation of satellite cell biology within the native environment.",
                "An early study investigating AAV transduction of satellite cells based on immunohistochemical staining and delivery of GFP found little or no vector transduction despite high transduction in skeletal myocytes.14 By using dual reporter mice, in which satellite cells are permanently marked by Cre-mediated recombination following transduction of AAV even after the AAV vector is lost, more recent studies have demonstrated that AAV transduction in satellite cells does occur at significant frequencies.6,15,16 Furthermore, they show that detectable levels of gene editing occur in satellite cells at the Dmd locus following AAV9-cytomegalovirus (CMV)-CRISPR treatment.6,16 Here, we expanded upon these studies by profiling AAV serotypes for satellite cell targeting, quantifying the level of gene editing, demonstrating in\u00a0vivo functionality of gene-edited cells, and measuring the activity of muscle-specific promoters in satellite cells.",
                "With the use of a Pax7nGFP;Ai9 dual reporter mouse, we also found significant AAV transduction of satellite cells in both mdx and wild-type (WT) mice. We tested multiple AAV serotypes with intramuscular and systemic injections and found AAV8 and AAV9 have the highest tropism to satellite cells. We then treated Pax7nGFP;mdx mice with a dual-AAV9 CRISPR system designed to excise exon 23 in the mdx mouse. To quantify gene-editing levels in satellite cells without introducing ex\u00a0vivo culturing artifacts, we isolated satellite cells 8\u00a0weeks after treatment with AAV9-CMV-CRISPR constructs and immediately harvested genomic DNA for analysis. We used an unbiased sequencing approach to quantify gene-editing outcomes, including exon deletions, indels, inversions, and integration of AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). To investigate continued therapeutic efficacy from satellite cell-genome editing, we implemented a serial injury model to induce muscle degeneration with concomitant loss of therapeutic vectors and found that mice treated with CRISPR retained dystrophin expression after three rounds of injury. We also directly demonstrate that CRISPR-corrected satellite cells can give rise to new dystrophin fibers in a transplantation assay. Finally, we demonstrate activity and verify gene editing with muscle-specific promoters driving Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) expression in satellite cells. Collectively, these results confirm that satellite cells are transduced by AAV and undergo gene editing by CRISPR, which could facilitate enduring therapeutic effects for DMD."

                        "The Ai9 mouse allele harbors a CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato expression cassette at the Rosa26 locus.17 Excision of the stop cassette by the Cre recombinase leads to permanent labeling of target cells with expression of the tdTomato fluorescent protein. We crossed the Ai9 mice to the Pax7nGFP mice, in which a nuclear-localized GFP (nGFP) is knocked into the first exon of Pax7 to specifically label satellite cells.18 By delivering the Cre recombinase via an AAV vector, tdTomato expression labels cells transduced by the AAV (Figure\u00a01A). Therefore, any GFP+ cells that coexpress tdTomato represent satellite cells that were transduced with the AAV vector (Figure\u00a01B). We injected AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, AAV6.2 (AAV6 with a point mutation increasing transduction efficiency19), AAV8, and AAV9 serotypes encoding CMV-Cre into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of Pax7nGFP;Ai9;mdx mice at equivalent doses of 4.72E+11 vector genome (vg). Muscles were harvested 8\u00a0weeks after injection, and the tissue was dissociated to single cells for immediate analysis by flow cytometry. We found that AAV9, AAV6.2, and AAV8 marked the Pax7nGFP+ cells most efficiently, leading to tdTomato expression in ~60% of nGFP+ cells (Figure\u00a01C). We then assessed the top four performing AAV serotypes by systemic AAV-CMV-Cre administration via tail-vein injection at equivalent doses of 2E+12 vg. We harvested various skeletal muscle types and found that following systemic injection, AAV8 and AAV9 clearly outperformed AAV6.2 and AAV1 with significant targeting of Pax7-GFP+ cells, ranging from 20% to 30% for various muscle types (Figure\u00a01D). Correct colocalization of tdTomato and Pax7 in\u00a0vivo was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections (Figure\u00a01E).Figure\u00a01A Dual Reporter Mouse to Quantify AAV Transduction in Satellite Cells(A) Schematic illustration of the dual reporter mouse harboring a knock-in nuclear GFP (nGFP) at the Pax7 locus and CAG-LSL-tdTomato at the Rosa26 locus.

Interestingly, we found significantly different transduction efficiencies of satellite cells in mdx versus WT mice for all muscle tissues tested except the diaphragm (Figure\u00a01F), perhaps related to the activated state of satellite cells in regenerating dystrophic muscles."

The SaCas9 and gRNA AAV vectors were premixed in equivalent viral titers of 1E+12 vg/vector and injected into the TA muscle. Control mice received an injection of an equal volume of PBS to the TA. At 8\u00a0weeks after injection, muscle was harvested for enzymatic dissociation and satellite cell sorting. Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted cells, and a nested PCR reaction was performed across exon 23 to visualize the rare and smaller deletion band in satellite cells isolated from CRISPR-treated muscle (Figure\u00a02B). Systemic delivery of AAV9-CMV-CRISPR at 5E+12 vg/vector was also performed, and satellite cells were isolated from hind-limb muscles and the diaphragm 8\u00a0weeks after treatment.

The various editing outcomes ranged from ~0.01% to 1% in satellite cells, with indels at single gRNA sites being the most common outcome. We also applied this method to cDNA from these cells to quantify the level of exon 23 deletion in dystrophin transcripts, which ranged from ~0.4% to 1% (Figure\u00a02F).

                        "Next, we sought to define the recombination efficiency in satellite cells when Cre is driven by muscle-specific promoters as opposed to a constitutive CMV promoter. Because many commonly used AAV vectors display broad-tissue tropism, clinical trials are moving forward with tissue-specific promoters when available to avoid off-target expression of transgenes. CMV-driven Cas9 expression has been shown to elicit an immune response in adult mice and can cause gene editing in nonmuscle tissue.21 The restriction of Cas9 expression to muscles can reduce the risk of off-target genome-editing effects and could minimize the elicitation of an immune response.22 Although muscle-specific promoters are designed to target skeletal and heart muscle efficiently, the extent of expression in satellite cells is presumed to be inefficient.9 To determine the efficiency of gene expression in satellite cells with our dual reporter system, we delivered 4E+10 vg of AAV9 encoding the ubiquitous CMV promoter or the muscle-specific CK8e,23 SPc5-12,24 or MHCK725 promoters driving Cre recombinase expression to the TA muscle of Pax7nGFP;Ai9;mdx mice. Compared to CMV (33%), the efficiency of recombination was about one-half for MHCK7 (15.6%) and CK8e (15.6%) and one-third for SpC5-12 (11.5%), suggesting that these muscle-specific promoters are active in satellite cells, albeit to a lesser degree than CMV (Figure\u00a03A).Figure\u00a03Muscle-Specific Promoters Are Active in Satellite Cells(A) Muscle-specific promoters driving Cre expression were packaged into AAV9 and delivered in equal doses by intramuscular injection into Pax7nGFP;Ai9;mdx mice.

We compared dystrophin restoration at the bulk muscle level among the different promoters, and immunofluorescence staining of TA muscle sections revealed higher numbers of dystrophin+ fibers in muscles treated with AAV-CRISPR harboring MHCK7 (73%), SPc5-12 (53%), and CK8e (48.3%) promoters compared to CMV (35%) (Figure\u00a03B). With the use of the unbiased Tn5 tagmentation-based method, we also quantified the level of gene-editing outcomes across these different promoters in the bulk muscle (Figures 3C and 3D). We found the highest occurrence of deletions in the MHCK7-SaCas9-treated mice, followed by SPc5-12. To determine if gene editing can be accomplished in satellite cells with muscle-specific promoters, we isolated nGFP+ satellite cells from treated mice and performed a nonquantitative nested PCR across the Dmd locus.

                        "Targeting satellite cells for dystrophin gene correction could provide a self-renewing source of dystrophin-expressing cells that might provide continued therapeutic effects even after loss of the episomal AAV vector. To investigate the long-term contribution of dystrophin-corrected satellite cells, we injected TA muscles of mdx mice with AAV9-CRISPR constructs with CMV promoter-driving SaCas9 and monitored dystrophin expression. Because the mdx mouse model does not recapitulate the severity of the human DMD-degenerative phenotype, we accelerated muscle degeneration and regeneration by implementing a serial injury strategy. 4\u00a0weeks after the initial injection of AAV9-CMV-CRISPR constructs, mice were injected with 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 1.2% barium chloride (BaCl2) to induce muscle injury every 2\u00a0weeks for a maximum of 6\u00a0weeks (Figure\u00a04A). This dose of BaCl2 injury to the TA induces necrosis in over 80% of muscle fibers, 18\u00a0h after injury in WT mice.26 We thus hypothesized that 2 or 3 rounds of injury would be sufficient to induce degeneration of CRISPR-treated myofibers, followed by regeneration of new myofibers from satellite cells. After 2 or 3 injuries, we could no longer detect SaCas9 protein in the TA muscle by western blot, indicating loss of the AAV9 vectors (Figure\u00a04B). Despite loss of vector, we observed maintenance of dystrophin expression over three rounds of regeneration by immunofluorescence staining (Figure\u00a04C). Quantification of dystrophin+ fibers as a fraction of all fibers (laminin+) indicates an initial restoration of dystrophin in 28.3% of fibers that decreased to ~10% after either 2 or 3 injuries (Figure\u00a04D). This observed maintenance of dystrophin protein after loss of SaCas9 suggests that edited satellite cells may serve as a long-term reservoir for dystrophin production. It is also possible that dystrophin restoration in satellite cells is conferring selective advantage, given that dystrophin has been reported to play a role in satellite cell maintenance27.Figure\u00a04Serial Injury of TA Muscle Treated with AAV9-CMV-CRISPR Demonstrates Sustained Expression of Dystrophin after Loss of AAV Vector Expression(A) Schematic illustration of serial injury strategy. mdx mice were treated with AAV9-CMV-CRISPR constructs by intramuscular injection. 4\u00a0weeks later, mice were injured with 50\u00a0\u03bcL of 1.2% BaCl2 to induce muscle degeneration and regeneration.

Pax7nGFP;mdx mice were injected in the hindlimb with either AAV9-CMV-CRISPR constructs or PBS. 8\u00a0weeks later, the injected muscles were harvested, and ~30,000 GFP+ satellite cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Sorted cells were immediately transplanted into the TA muscle of an otherwise untreated mdx host mouse, which received 18\u00a0Gy irradiation, 2\u00a0days prior to incapacitate host satellite cells.28 The host mice were immunosuppressed with daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of tacrolimus. At 4\u00a0weeks postengraftment, the TA muscles were harvested and analyzed for dystrophin expression. Patches of dystrophin+ fibers were observed in the host TA muscles injected with CRISPR-corrected satellite cells (Figure\u00a05B). mdx host mice that were injected with satellite cells harvested from PBS-injected Pax7nGFP;mdx donor mice displayed 1.46\u00a0\u00b1 0.41 dystrophin+ fibers per square millimeter, which is similar to the number of revertant fibers found in mdx mice of the same age group.29 In contrast, mdx mice that were injected with satellite cells harvested from CRISPR-injected mdx mice displayed 5.95\u00a0\u00b1 0.40 dystrophin+ fibers per square millimeter (Figure\u00a05C), suggesting that transplantation of CRISPR-corrected satellite cells led to an increase in dystrophin+ fibers. When we performed a deletion PCR across the Dmd locus, we saw a deletion band only in genomic DNA from the host TA that was injected with CRISPR-treated satellite cells, indicating that the dystrophin+ fibers observed in that group are produced from gene-edited cells (Figure\u00a04D).Figure\u00a05Serial Transplantation of CRISPR-Edited Satellite Cells from mdx Mice Contributes to Muscle Regeneration(A) Schematic illustration of the serial engraftment strategy.

                "In this study, we demonstrate that AAV can efficiently transduce satellite cells in\u00a0vivo using a sensitive Cre/lox-based dual-reporter mouse. We test a series of commonly used AAV serotypes that exhibit unique tissue tropism to conclude that AAV9 and AAV8 are most suitable for satellite cell transduction in both local injections as well as systemic tail-vein injections (Figure\u00a01). These results support the conclusions of recent papers that utilized a similar strategy6,15,16 and contrast a previous report that satellite cells are not efficiently transduced by AAV.14",
                "Interestingly, we found higher AAV9 transduction in mdx mice compared to WT mice (Figure\u00a01F). Satellite cells are heterogeneous and can exist in both quiescent and activated states. Due to the constant demand for regeneration, mdx mice have a higher number of activated satellite cells20,30 that express a set of surface markers that distinguish them from quiescent satellite cells.31 This difference in surface markers may influence their ability to be transduced by AAV. The congruence in diaphragm satellite cell transduction efficiencies in WT versus mdx mice may be due to the fact that the diaphragm is functionally and morphologically distinct from limb muscles. The diaphragm has the highest satellite cell contribution to myofiber generation due to the constant activation of this muscle to drive ventilation.32 Furthermore, diaphragm satellite cells are molecularly unique from limb muscles in their expression of Pax3.33",
                "We also demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing occurs in the satellite cell population in\u00a0vivo, and we quantify the level of gene-editing outcomes, which revealed significantly less gene editing in the satellite cell population compared to bulk muscle (Figures 2 and S1). However, one caveat to this study is the inability to detect edited satellite cells that go on to differentiate into muscle fibers. Therefore, the quantification presented here represents genome-editing levels in the remaining satellite cell population at 8\u00a0weeks after treatment and therefore, may underestimate total levels of editing in these cells. Compared to the percentage of satellite cells that underwent Cre-mediated recombination (~60%; Figure\u00a01C), the percentage of total gene editing in satellite cells was significantly lower (up to 1.5%; Figure\u00a02E) despite a comparable dose of AAV, use of the CMV promoter in both studies, same injection route, and same dystrophic muscle context. This may be due to several factors, including the necessity of transduction by two AAV constructs for CRISPR delivery but only one AAV for Cre delivery. Additionally, two separate gRNAs must concurrently induce double-strand breaks for proper exon 23 deletion to occur, and consequently, the intended exon deletion is only a fraction of the total editing events (Figure\u00a02E).21 Also, it is probable that Cre-mediated recombination is significantly more efficient than CRISPR-induced gene editing, since Cre acts autonomously, but gene editing requires additional steps of overcoming endogenous DNA repair mechanisms. Accordingly, the ~1.5% total gene-editing frequency does not capture events in which CRISPR induced a double-strand break, and nonhomologous end-joining resulted in perfect repair, which is likely the outcome of most Cas9-induced breaks.",
                "It has been presumed that muscle-specific promoters, which are often constructed from regulatory elements in the creatine kinase promoter, are inactive in satellite cells due to the low expression of creatine kinase in proliferating myoblasts in culture.9 By replacing the CMV promoter with various muscle-specific promoters to drive Cre recombinase and delivering equal doses of AAV9, we observed that muscle-specific promoters MHCK7, CK8e, and SpC5-12 were indeed active in satellite cells (Figure\u00a03). Furthermore, these muscle-specific promoters were also able to drive SaCas9 expression to induce gene editing in the satellite cell populations, further supporting their use as an alternative to constitutive promoters, which may create undesired risks, such as off-target genome modification and elicitation of an immune response. Interestingly, the MHCK7 promoter led to the greatest level of dystrophin restoration (Figure\u00a03B) and gene editing (Figure\u00a03C), even relative to CMV. It is not clear at this time what control elements in MHCK7 versus those in CK8e provide a stronger response. The CK7 portion of MHCK7 contains the same highly conserved mouse creatine kinase 5\u2032 enhancer and proximal promoter control elements as those in CK8e, but CK8e lacks several regions of a less highly conserved sequence that were removed to miniaturize the CK8e cassette. MHCK7 also contains a highly conserved, ~190-bp portion of the mouse alpha myosin heavy chain enhancer that contains an MCAT and two GATA control elements that are not present in CK8e.25 A potential caveat to the dual reporter mouse is the possibility that differentiating myoblasts may express residual nGFP, while upregulating genes associated with differentiation, such as creatine kinase and myosin heavy chain. However, the high levels of AAV transduction and Cre-mediated recombination with all promoters tested (>10%; Figure\u00a03D) suggest that this small subset of cells does not fully explain the signal we observed.",
                "To further support our conclusions that satellite cells are edited by CRISPR/Cas9 in\u00a0vivo, we used two independent methods: assessing maintenance of dystrophin expression after degeneration (Figure\u00a04) and dystrophin expression following satellite cell transplantation (Figure\u00a05). We demonstrated longevity of dystrophin expression after three rounds of degeneration and regeneration, which may indicate long-term contribution from dystrophin-corrected satellite cells. Importantly, since satellite cells are self-renewing, and there are many satellite cells on each fiber,20 even low levels of edited satellite cells may lead to significant levels of dystrophin-positive fibers over time. To directly demonstrate the functionality of edited satellite cells, we performed an engraftment assay, which showed three-fold more dystrophin+ fibers in host TA muscles injected with satellite cells isolated from donor TAs treated with AAV9-CMV-CRISPR.",
                "We have previously observed in analysis of AAV8-CMV-CRISPR-treated bulk muscle tissue from mdx mice that low levels of editing at the DNA level (~2%) correspond to relatively high levels of exon exclusion at the mRNA level (~59%) and dystrophin-positive muscle fibers (~67%).5 We report similar levels here using the Tn5 tagmentation-based quantification. We have speculated that this apparent discrepancy in editing levels and dystrophin expression is explained by protection of the edited dystrophin transcript from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of the unedited transcript that contains a nonsense mutation in exon 23. Here, we see a similar increase in editing levels in satellite cells when comparing editing at the DNA level (~0.05% deletions; Figure\u00a02E) to edited RNA transcripts (~0.5%\u20131%; Figure\u00a02F). This observation is also consistent with recent reports that surprisingly observe dystrophin expression in satellite cells.27",
                "In summary, this study builds upon previously reported evidence of satellite cell transduction and CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene editing and provides new insights into choice of AAV serotype and promoter. With the use of an unbiased Tn5 tagmentation-based sequencing method, we provide quantifications of the amount of gene editing in satellite cells. There is significant interest in developing enhanced delivery vehicles for CRISPR to muscle, including evolved or engineered AAV capsids34 and nonviral nanoparticle strategies that overcome challenges of viral vectors.35,36 Delivery to satellite cells by these methods may be an important consideration for their ultimate success in the context of inherited muscular dystrophies. Further optimization of gene-editing technologies and delivery methods should focus on enhancing satellite cell gene editing to provide a long-term therapeutic effect for DMD patients."
