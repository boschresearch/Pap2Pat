                        "The characteristic neuropathological and molecular lesions that correlate with dementia in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) include the accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated and poly-ubiquinated microtubule-associated proteins, such as tau, resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neuritis, and neuropil threads. Neuronal cytoskeletal abnormalities are associated with cerebral atrophy with cell and fiber loss, and synaptic disconnection. Increased amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition around and within the walls of meningeal and cortical vessels, the cortical neuropil, and neuronal perikarya is a feature of both AD and normal aging. Although genetic factors can predispose individuals to develop premature and excessive cerebral deposits of A\u03b2 in AD-type dementia, most cases are sporadic and do not exhibit clear familial or genetic clustering. Recent exploration of biochemical, molecular, and cellular abnormalities that precede or accompany classic AD demonstrated that cell loss was associated with increased activation of pro-death genes and signaling pathways, impaired energy metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic oxidative stress, and cerebrovascular disease/cerebral hypoperfusion. However, the inability to interlink these phenomena under a single primary pathogenic mechanism resulted in the emergence and propagation of various heavily debated theories, each of which focused on how one particular component of AD could trigger a cascade that contributes to the development of all other known abnormalities.",
                        "Currently, the major pathological factors known to be involved in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) include beta amyloid accumulation, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and synaptic dysfunction or loss. In addition, AD is associated with other pathological processes, including failing mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, increased inflammatory response, protein misfolding, altered growth factor signaling, aberrant reentry of neurons into the cell cycle, lysosomal activation, endocrine alteration, insulin resistance, cholesterol dyshomeostasis, and calcium dysregulation.",
                        "The complexity and number of changes associated with AD has impeded attempts to disentangle the processes important for pathogenesis and discover a treatment of AD. Therefore, there sill remains a need for identifying agents or molecules that can be used for diagnosis and/or treating AD."

In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the subject technology.",
                        "With aging, multiple Ca2+-associated electrophysiological processes exhibit increased magnitude in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, including the Ca2+-dependent slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP), L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (L-VGCC) activity, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and Ca2+ transients. This pattern of Ca2+ dysregulation correlates with reduced neuronal excitability/plasticity and impaired learning/memory and has been proposed to contribute to unhealthy brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms.",
                        "The inventors have recently found that expression of the Ca2+-stabilizing molecules, FKBP1a, FKBP1b, junctophilin 3, junctophilin 4, and calmodulin 3 decreases in hippocampus of humans with early-stage AD and that this decrease correlates with incipient cognitive dysfunction (Blalock et al., J. Chemical Neuroanatomy 42:118-126; July 2011). They have further observed that disrupting FKBP1b function destabilizes Ca2+ homeostasis in hippocampal neurons and is sufficient to induce the aging phenotype of Ca2+ dysregulation in young animals. In their study, the inventors found that disruption of FKBP1b recapitulated much of the Ca2+-dysregulation aging phenotype in young rat hippocampus, supporting the hypothesis that declining FKBP function plays a major role in unhealthy brain aging (Gant et al., J. Neuroscience, 31(5):1693-1703; February 2011).",
                        "However, the subject technology relates, in part, to an unexpected discovery that over expression of the Fkbp1b open reading frame (ORF) in the hippocampus of aging rats not only counteracts Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, but also improves maze learning and/or memory in rats. This unexpected discovery suggests that Fkpb1b and other Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules including immunophilins such as Fkbp1a, junctophilins such as junctophilins 3 and 4 or clamodulins such as chalmodulin 3, as well as intraneuronal calcium channels such as ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and/or Inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) are novel therapeutic molecules and/or targets for interventions aimed at protection against unhealthy brain aging or Alzheimer's disease through stabilization of Ca2+ release mechanisms in brain cells.",

                                "As used herein, the term \u201cearly-stage AD\u201d refers to incipient Alzheimer's Disease characterized by at least some of and in many cases all of the following signs and symptoms: recent memory is impaired; learning and retaining new information becomes difficult. Language problems (especially with word finding), mood swings, and personality changes develop. Patient may have progressive difficulty with independent activities of daily living (e.g., balancing their checkbook, finding their way around, remembering where they put things). Abstract thinking, insight, or judgment may be impaired. Patients may respond to loss of independence and memory with irritability, hostility, and agitation. Functional ability may be further limited by the following: Agnosia: Impaired ability to identify objects despite intact sensory function; Apraxia: Impaired ability to do previously learned motor activities despite intact motor function; and Aphasia: Impaired ability to comprehend or use language. Although early-stage AD may not compromise sociability, family members may report strange behavior accompanied by emotional lability. Pathophysiologically, early-stage AD refers to the beginning stages of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-protein deposit in the brain. Additional information related to identifying early-stage AD are provided American Academy of Neurology (AAN), a summary of which is provided at www.aan.com/professionals/practice/pdfs/dementia_guideline.pdf. Early-stage AD can further be described in terms of the MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) score (See Blalock et al., PNAS 101(7):2173-2178 (2004)). For example, subjects can be categorized into the following four groups based on MMSE score: \u201cControl\u201d (MMSE>25), \u201cIncipient AD\u201d (MMSE=20-26), \u201cModerate AD\u201d (MMSE=14-19), and \u201cSevereAD\u201d (MMSE<14). Early-stage AD can further be described as a stage prior to onset of intermediate- or late-stage AD.",
                                "In intermediate stage AD, patients are unable to learn or recall new information. Memory of remote events is reduced, but not totally lost. Patients may require help with basic activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, eating, dressing, toileting). Personality changes may progress. Patients may become irritable, anxious, self-centered, inflexible, or angry more easily, or they may become more passive, with a flat affect, depression, indecisiveness, lack of spontaneity, or general withdrawal from social situations. Behavior disorders may develop: Patients may wander or become suddenly and inappropriately agitated, hostile, uncooperative, or physically aggressive. By this stage, patients have lost all sense of time and place because they cannot effectively use normal environmental and social cues. Patients often get lost; they may be unable to find their own bedroom or bathroom. They remain ambulatory but are at risk of falls or accidents secondary to confusion. Altered sensation or perception may culminate in psychosis with hallucinations and paranoid and persecutory delusions. Sleep patterns are often disorganized.",
                                "In late or severe stage of AD, patients cannot walk, feed themselves, or do any other activities of daily living; they may become incontinent. Recent and remote memory is completely lost. Patients may be unable to swallow. They are at risk of malnutrition, pneumonia (especially due to aspiration), and pressure ulcers. Because they depend completely on others for care, placement in a long-term care facility often becomes necessary. Eventually, patients become mute.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cmild cognitive impairment (MCI)\u201d takes its ordinary meaning in the art. MCI mostly refers to a condition that is more severe than age-associated memory impairment. In MCI, memory is impaired compared with that of age-matched controls, but other cognitive domains and daily function are not affected. Up to 50% of patients with mild cognitive impairment develop dementia within 3 yr. Normally, patients with MCI once identified are monitored for progression to AD. MCI is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more serious decline of dementia. It can involve problems with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than normal age-related changes. Patients with mild cognitive impairment may be aware that their memory or mental function has \u201cslipped.\u201d Their families and close friends also may notice a change. But generally these changes aren't severe enough to interfere with the patients' day-to-day life and usual activities.",

These 10 warning signs are: 1. Memory loss that affects job skills; 2. Difficulty performing familiar tasks; 3. Problems with language; 4. Disorientation to time and place; 5. Poor or decreased judgment; 6. Problems with abstract thinking; 7. Misplacing things; 8. Changes in mood or behavior; 9. Changes in personality; 10. Loss of initiative. Also, it is known that there is a familial pattern of AD, thus first-degree biological relatives of individuals with AD may be at an elevated risk of AD than the general population.",

                                "In previous studies conducted in the inventors' lab, it was shown that the expression of the FKBP1b gene, which encodes the FK-506 binding protein 1b (FKBP1b, aka FKBP12.6), is decreased in hippocampal cells of patients with early-stage AD (Blalock et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 101:2173-2178 (2004)) and in aging rats (Kadish et al., J. Neurosci., 29:1805-1816 (2009)). Because the study was conducted on hand-dissected frozen hippocampal CA1 blocks containing both white and gray matter, the authors found that it was not possible to distinguish transcriptional changes. Further, since heterogeneous cells types/regions were mixed together in these studies, tissue-specific changes were obscured. No definitive conclusion on the role of FKBP1b in cognition and AD could be drawn or suggested.",
                                "In a more recent study (Blalock et al, 2011), a gene expression profiling of the laser-captured gray matter regions of hippocampal sections revealed that, with AD, brain (hippocampal) expression also decreases for a plurality of genes that encode proteins that stabilize Ca2+ release from RyRs in muscle cells, including FKBP1b, FKBP1a, two junctophilins and CALM3. Further, it was found that the decreased expression of these molecules correlated with decreased cognitive function in early-stage AD patients.",
                                "In another more recent study (Gant et al., 2011), it was shown that directly manipulating FKBP1b in key brain regions of rats, by microinjecting an inactivated viral vector containing short interfering RNA against Fkbp1b, can induce Ca2+ dysregulation (measured electrophysiologically) related to memory loss and aging phenotype.",

It was even more unexpected to discover that this reversal of Ca2+ dysregulation resulted in an improved memory. Thus, according to the subject technology, the stabilization of Ca2+ release from the calcium receptors such as RyRs or InsP3R, as observed in the present disclosure, leads to the reversal of Ca2+ dysregulation and indicates that both the receptors and molecules that stabilize these receptors can be used as targets for developing diagnostic and/or therapeutic means for treating or inhibiting memory loss, AD, MCI, and other cognitive or memory impairments.",

InsP3R is very diverse among organisms, and is necessary for the control of cellular and physiological processes including cell division, cell proliferation, apoptosis, fertilization, development, behavior, learning and memory. Inositol triphosphate receptor represents a dominant second messenger leading to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites. There is evidence suggesting that InsP3R plays an important role in the conversion of external stimuli to intracellular Ca2+ signals characterized by complex patterns relative to both space and time, for example, Ca2+ waves and oscillations. The InsP3 receptor was first purified from rat cerebellum. There are multiple isoforms of ryanodine receptors including: InsP3R1 (also abbreviated as ITPR1; Entrez ID No. 3708; Hugo ID.

Alternatively, the ratio of Ca2+ stabilizing genes could be compared to values for those same Ca2+ stabilizing genes in normal subjects, which would be obtained by averaging across a statistically significant number of control subjects that did not exhibit AD or cognitive decline. Several statistical techniques well-known in the field will allow determination of the degree of deviation of the expression of Ca2+ release-stabilizing genes from expression of AD-insensitive genes relative to a normalizing baseline, or from averages of Ca2+ release-stabilizing genes in non-AD subjects, thereby providing a quantitative index of deviation that can be used to estimate AD risk or progression.

Another aspect of the subject technology pertains to isolated nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify the nucleic acid molecules encoding the targets of the subject technology in a sample, as well as nucleotide fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of the nucleic acid molecules which encode the targets of the subject technology. As used herein, the term \u201cnucleic acid molecule\u201d is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs.

Using all or portion of the nucleic acid sequence of the FKBP gene, e.g., the FKBP1b as a hybridization probe, a target gene of the subject technology or a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide target of the subject technology can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989).",

The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to target nucleotide sequences, or nucleotide sequences encoding a target of the subject technology can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer.",

The probe/primer typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 7 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 400 or more consecutive nucleotides of a target nucleic acid, or a nucleic acid encoding a target polypeptide of the subject technology.",

In preferred embodiments, the probe comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress (e.g., over- or under-express) a target polypeptide of the subject technology, or which have greater or fewer copies of a target gene of the subject technology. For example, a level of a target polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject may be detected, the amount of mRNA transcript of a gene encoding a target polypeptide may be determined, or the presence of mutations or deletions of a target gene of the subject technology may be assessed.",
                                "The subject technology further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleic acid sequences of the gene of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules of the subject technology, e.g., FKBP1b gene, due to degeneracy of the genetic code and which thus encode the same proteins as those encoded by the gene of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene.",
                                "It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that DNA sequence polymorphisms can lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by the genes of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules of the instant disclosure. Such genetic polymorphism in, for example, the FKBP1b gene, may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. An allele is one of a group of genes which occur alternatively at a given genetic locus. In addition it will be appreciated that DNA polymorphisms that affect RNA expression levels can also exist that may affect the overall expression level of that gene (e.g., by affecting regulation or degradation). As used herein, the phrase \u201callelic variant\u201d includes a nucleotide sequence which occurs at a given locus or to a polypeptide encoded by the nucleotide sequence. As used herein, the terms \u201cgene\u201d and \u201crecombinant gene\u201d refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a target polypeptide of the subject technology.",

Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the target genes of the subject technology can further be isolated by mapping to the same chromosome or locus as the target genes or genes encoding the target proteins of the subject technology.",
                                "In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the subject technology is at least 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a nucleotide sequence of a target gene or gene encoding a target protein of the subject technology. As used herein, the term \u201chybridizes under stringent conditions\u201d is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences at least 60% sequence identity (over their entire lengths) to each other typically remain hybridized to each other. Generally, percent homology or identity is based on two polynucleotide strands that are comparable in length the percent value reflects homology throughout the length of the two strands. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% homologous to each other (over their entire lengths or throughout their lengths) typically remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization in 6\u00d7 sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45\u00b0 C., followed by one or more washes in 0.2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50\u00b0 C., preferably at 55\u00b0 C., more preferably at 60\u00b0 C., and even more preferably at 65\u00b0 C. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the subject technology that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of the gene of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene. As used herein, a \u201cnaturally-occurring\u201d nucleic acid molecule includes an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g. encodes a natural protein).",
                                "In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the target gene and gene encoding a target protein of the subject technology sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of the target genes or genes encoding the target proteins of the subject technology, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins, without altering the functional activity of these proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at \u201cnon-essential\u201d amino acid residues can be made. A \u201cnon-essential\u201d amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of a protein without altering the biological activity, whereas an \u201cessential\u201d amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among allelic variants or homologs of a gene (e.g., among homologs of a gene from different species) are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration.",
                                "Accordingly, another aspect of the subject technology pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding a target protein of the subject technology that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such proteins differ in amino acid sequence from the target proteins encoded by the gene of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules yet retain the same biological activity. In one embodiment, the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more homologous or identical to a target protein of the subject technology.",
                                "An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein homologous to a target protein of the subject technology can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the target protein, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into the gene of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene, of the subject technology by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a coding sequence of a gene of the subject technology, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined.",
                                "In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules of the present subject technology can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety or phosphate backbone to improve, e.g., the stability, hybridization, or solubility of the molecule. For example, the deoxyribose phosphate backbone of the nucleic acid molecules can be modified to generate peptide nucleic acids (see Hyrup B. et al. (1996) Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 4 (1): 5-23). As used herein, the terms \u201cpeptide nucleic acids\u201d or \u201cPNAs\u201d refer to nucleic acid mimics, e.g., DNA mimics, in which the deoxyribose phosphate backbone is replaced by a pseudopeptide backbone and only the four natural nucleobases are retained. The neutral backbone of PNAs has been shown to allow for specific hybridization to DNA and RNA under conditions of low ionic strength. The synthesis of PNA oligomers can be performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols as described in Hyrup B. et al. (1996) supra; Perry-O'Keefe et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93: 14670-675.",
                                "In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6553-6556; Lemaitre et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:648-652; PCT Publication No. WO88/09810) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO89/10134). In addition, oligonucleotides can be modified with hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (See, e.g., Krol et al. (1988) Bio-Techniques 6:958-976) or intercalating agents. (See, eg., Zon (1988) Pharm. Res. 5:539-549). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule, (e.g., a peptide, hybridization triggered cross-linking agent, transport agent, or hybridization-triggered cleavage agent). Finally, the oligonucleotide may be detectably labeled, either such that the label is detected by the addition of another reagent (e.g. a substrate for an enzymatic label), or is detectable immediately upon hybridization of the nucleotide (e.g., a radioactive label or a fluorescent label (e.g., a molecular beacon, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,930."

                                "One aspect of the subject technology pertains to isolated target proteins i.e., the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., Fkbp1a, Fkbp1b variant_a, Fkbp1b variant_b, Junctophilin 3, Junctophilin 4 and Calmodulin 3, and biologically or functionally active portions thereof suitable for use as therapeutic molecules for stabilizing calcium release from ryanodine receptors (RyRs), inosital triphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs). Alternatively, the isolated target proteins i.e., the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., Fkbp1a, Fkbp1b variant_a, Fkbp1b variant_b, Junctophilin 3, Junctophilin 4 and Calmodulin 3, and biologically or functionally active portions thereof suitable for use are used as immunogens to raise anti-target protein antibodies. In one embodiment, native target proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, target proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a target protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques.",
                                "An \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201cpurified\u201d protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the target protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language \u201csubstantially free of cellular material\u201d includes preparations of target protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language \u201csubstantially free of cellular material\u201d includes preparations of target protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of non-target protein (also referred to herein as a \u201ccontaminating protein\u201d), more preferably less than about 20% of non-target protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-target protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-target protein. When the target protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation.",

In one embodiment, the language \u201csubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\u201d includes preparations of protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-protein chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-protein chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-protein chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-protein chemicals.",
                                "As used herein, a \u201cbiologically active portion\u201d or \u201cfunctional fragment\u201d (as used interchangeably) of a target protein includes a fragment of a target protein comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the amino acid sequence of the target protein, which include fewer amino acids than the full length target proteins, and exhibit at least one activity of a target protein, i.e., Ca2+ release-stabilizing activity on RyRs or InsP3Rs. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the target protein. A biologically active portion of a target protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 or more amino acids in length. Biologically active portions of a target protein can be used as targets for developing agents which modulate a target protein-mediated activity.",
                                "In a preferred embodiment, target protein is encoded by the gene of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules. In other embodiments, the target protein is substantially homologous to a target protein encoded by the genes of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene, and retains the functional activity of the target protein, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the target protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or more sequence identity to the amino acid sequence encoded by the genes of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene.",
                                "To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid \u201cidentity\u201d is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid \u201chomology\u201d). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences.",
                                "The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mat. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4.",
                                "The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present subject technology can further be used as a \u201cquery sequence\u201d to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to nucleic acid molecules of the subject technology. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to target protein molecules of the subject technology. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used.",
                                "The subject technology also provides chimeric or fusion target proteins. As used herein, a target \u201cchimeric protein\u201d or \u201cfusion protein\u201d comprises a target polypeptide operatively linked to a non-target polypeptide. A \u201ctarget polypeptide\u201d includes a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence encoded by the genes of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene, whereas a \u201cnon-target polypeptide\u201d includes a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a protein which is not substantially homologous to the target protein, e.g., a protein which is different from target protein and which is derived from the same or a different organism. Within a target fusion protein the polypeptide can correspond to all or a portion of a target protein. In a preferred embodiment, a target fusion protein comprises at least one biologically active portion of a target protein. Within the fusion protein, the term \u201coperatively linked\u201d is intended to indicate that the target polypeptide and the non-target polypeptide are fused in-frame to each other. The non-target polypeptide can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the target polypeptide.",
                                "For example, in one embodiment, the fusion protein is a GST-target fusion protein in which the target sequences are fused to the C-terminus of the GST sequences. Such fusion proteins can facilitate the purification of recombinant target proteins.",
                                "In another embodiment, the fusion protein is a target protein containing a heterologous signal sequence at its N-terminus. In certain host cells (e.g., mammalian host cells), expression and/or secretion of target proteins can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence. Such signal sequences are well known in the art.",
                                "The target fusion proteins of the subject technology can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject in vivo, as described herein. The target fusion proteins can be used to affect the bioavailability of a target protein substrate. Use of target fusion proteins may be useful therapeutically for the treatment of disorders (e.g., AD, MCI or other cognitive impairments) caused by, for example, (i) aberrant modification or mutation of a gene encoding a target protein; (ii) mis-regulation of the target protein-encoding gene; and (iii) aberrant post-translational modification of a target protein.",
                                "Moreover, the target-fusion proteins of the subject technology can be used as immunogens to produce anti-target protein antibodies in a subject, to purify target protein ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of a target protein with a target protein substrate.",
                                "Preferably, a target chimeric or fusion protein of the subject technology is produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques, for example by employing blunt-ended or stagger-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, for example, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, eds. Ausubel et al. John Wiley & Sons: 1992). Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide). A target protein-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the target protein.",
                                "A signal sequence can be used to facilitate secretion and isolation of the secreted protein or other proteins of interest. Signal sequences are typically characterized by a core of hydrophobic amino acids which are generally cleaved from the mature protein during secretion in one or more cleavage events. Such signal peptides contain processing sites that allow cleavage of the signal sequence from the mature proteins as they pass through the secretory pathway. Thus, the subject technology pertains to the described polypeptides having a signal sequence, as well as to polypeptides from which the signal sequence has been proteolytically cleaved (i.e., the cleavage products). In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a signal sequence can be operably linked in an expression vector to a protein of interest, such as a protein which is ordinarily not secreted or is otherwise difficult to isolate. The signal sequence directs secretion of the protein, such as from a eukaryotic host into which the expression vector is transformed, and the signal sequence is subsequently or concurrently cleaved. The protein can then be readily purified from the extracellular medium by art recognized methods. Alternatively, the signal sequence can be linked to the protein of interest using a sequence which facilitates purification, such as with a GST domain.",
                                "The present subject technology also pertains to variants of the target proteins of the subject technology which function as either agonists (mimetics) or as antagonists to the target proteins. Variants of the target proteins can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g., discrete point mutation or truncation of a target protein. An agonist of the target proteins can retain substantially the same, or a subset, of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of a target protein. An antagonist of a target protein can inhibit one or more of the activities of the naturally occurring form of the target protein by, for example, competitively modulating an activity of a target protein. Thus, specific biological effects can be elicited by treatment with a variant of limited function. In one embodiment, treatment of a subject with a variant having a subset of the biological activities of the naturally occurring form of the protein has fewer side effects in a subject relative to treatment with the naturally occurring form of the target protein.",
                                "Variants of a target protein which function as either target protein agonists (mimetics) or as target protein antagonists can be identified by screening combinatorial libraries of mutants, e.g., truncation mutants, of a target protein for target protein agonist or antagonist activity. In one embodiment, a variegated library of target protein variants is generated by combinatorial mutagenesis at the nucleic acid level and is encoded by a variegated gene library. A variegated library of target protein variants can be produced by, for example, enzymatically ligating a mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides into gene sequences such that a degenerate set of potential target protein sequences is expressible as individual polypeptides, or alternatively, as a set of larger fusion proteins (e.g., for phage display) containing the set of target protein sequences therein. There are a variety of methods which can be used to produce libraries of potential target protein variants from a degenerate oligonucleotide sequence. Chemical synthesis of a degenerate gene sequence can be performed in an automatic DNA synthesizer, and the synthetic gene then ligated into an appropriate expression vector. Use of a degenerate set of genes allows for the provision, in one mixture, of all of the sequences encoding the desired set of potential target protein sequences. Methods for synthesizing degenerate oligonucleotides are known in the art (see, e.g., Narang, S. A. (1983) Tetrahedron 39:3; Itakura et al. (1984) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 53:323; Itakura et al. (1984) Science 198:1056; Ike et al. (1983) Nucleic Acid Res. 11:477).",
                                "In addition, libraries of fragments of a protein coding sequence corresponding to a target protein of the subject technology can be used to generate a variegated population of target protein fragments for screening and subsequent selection of variants of a target protein. In one embodiment, a library of coding sequence fragments can be generated by treating a double stranded PCR fragment of a target protein coding sequence with a nuclease under conditions wherein nicking occurs only about once per molecule, denaturing the double stranded DNA, renaturing the DNA to form double stranded DNA which can include sense/antisense pairs from different nicked products, removing single stranded portions from reformed duplexes by treatment with S1 nuclease, and ligating the resulting fragment library into an expression vector. By this method, an expression library can be derived which encodes N-terminal, C-terminal and internal fragments of various sizes of the target protein.",
                                "Several techniques are known in the art for screening gene products of combinatorial libraries made by point mutations or truncation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property. The most widely used techniques, which are amenable to high through-put analysis, for screening large gene libraries typically include cloning the gene library into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify target variants (Arkin and Yourvan (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7811-7815; Delgrave et al. (1993) Protein Engineering 6(3):327-331).",
                                "An isolated target protein, or a portion or fragment thereof, can be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies that bind target proteins using standard techniques for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. A full-length target protein can be used or, alternatively, the subject technology provides antigenic peptide fragments of these proteins for use as immunogens. The antigenic peptide of a target protein comprises at least 8 amino acid residues of an amino acid sequence encoded by the FKBP1b gene, and encompasses an epitope of a target protein such that an antibody raised against the peptide forms a specific immune complex with the target protein. Preferably, the antigenic peptide comprises at least 10 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 15 amino acid residues, even more preferably at least 20 amino acid residues, and most preferably at least 30 amino acid residues."

                                "Another aspect of the subject technology pertains to vectors, preferably expression vectors, containing a nucleic acid encoding a target protein, i.e., a Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecule, e.g., Fkbp1a, Fkbp1b variant_a, Fkbp1b variant_b, Junctophilin 3, Junctophilin 4 and Calmodulin 3 and biologically or functionally active portions thereof, of the subject technology. As used herein, the term \u201cvector\u201d includes a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a \u201cplasmid\u201d, which includes a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \u201cexpression vectors\u201d. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \u201cplasmid\u201d and \u201cvector\u201d can be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the subject technology is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g. replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.",
                                "The recombinant expression vectors of the subject technology comprise a nucleic acid of the subject technology in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences, selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operatively linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, \u201coperably linked\u201d is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g., in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell). The term \u201cregulatory sequence\u201d is intended to include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g., polyadenylation signals). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Goeddel; Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells and those which direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, and the like. The expression vectors of the subject technology can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., target proteins, mutant forms of target proteins, fusion proteins, and the like).",
                                "The recombinant expression vectors of the subject technology can be designed for expression of target proteins in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, target proteins can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells (using baculovirus expression vectors) yeast cells or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase.",
                                "Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in E. coli with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, usually to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors typically serve three purposes: 1) to increase expression of recombinant protein; 2) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and 3) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Typical fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S. (1988) Gene 67:31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) which fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein.",
                                "Purified fusion proteins can be utilized in target activity assays, (e.g., direct assays or competitive assays described in detail below), or to generate antibodies specific for target proteins, for example.",
                                "Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion E. coli expression vectors include pTrc (Amann et al., (1988) Gene 69:301-315) and pET 11d (Studier et al., Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990) 60-89). Target gene expression from the pTrc vector relies on host RNA polymerase transcription from a hybrid trp-lac fusion promoter. Target gene expression from the pET 11d vector relies on transcription from a T7 gn10-lac fusion promoter mediated by a coexpressed viral RNA polymerase (T7 gnl). This viral polymerase is supplied by host strains BL21(DE3) or HMS 174(DE3) from a resident prophage harboring a T7 gnl gene under the transcriptional control of the lacUV 5 promoter.",
                                "One strategy to maximize recombinant protein expression in E. coli is to express the protein in a host bacteria with an impaired capacity to proteolytically cleave the recombinant protein (Gottesman, S., Gene Expression Technology: Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990) 119-128). Another strategy is to alter the nucleic acid sequence of the nucleic acid to be inserted into an expression vector so that the individual codons for each amino acid are those preferentially utilized in E. coli (Wada et al., (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:2111-2118). Such alteration of nucleic acid sequences of the subject technology can be carried out by standard DNA synthesis techniques.",
                                "In another embodiment, the target protein expression vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast S. cerevisiae include pYepSec1 (Baldari, et al., (1987) Embo J. 6:229-234), pMFa (Kurjan and Herskowitz, (1982) Cell 30:933-943), pJRY88 (Schultz et al., (1987) Gene 54:113-123), pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), and picZ (InVitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calif.).",
                                "Alternatively, target proteins of the subject technology can be expressed in insect cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (e.g., Sf 9 cells) include the pAc series (Smith et al. (1983) Mol. Cell Biol. 3:2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers (1989) Virology 170:31-39).",
                                "In yet another embodiment, a nucleic acid of the subject technology is expressed in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, B. (1987) Nature 329:840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6:187-195). When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions are often provided by viral regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus and Simian Virus 40. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see chapters 16 and 17 of Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989.",
                                "In another embodiment, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert et al. (1987) Genes Dev. 1:268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton (1988) Adv. Immunol. 43:235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore (1989) EMBO J. 8:729-733) and immunoglobulins (Banerji et al. (1983) Cell 33:729-740; Queen and Baltimore (1983) Cell 33:741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Ruddle (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund et al. (1985) Science 230:912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, for example the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss (1990) Science 249:374-379) and the fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman (1989) Genes Dev. 3:537-546).",
                                "Another aspect of the subject technology pertains to host cells into which a nucleic acid molecule of the subject technology is introduced, e.g., genes of the Ca2+ release-stabilizing molecules, e.g., FKBP1b gene within a recombinant expression vector or a nucleic acid molecule of the subject technology containing sequences which allow it to homologously recombine into a specific site of the host cell's genome. The terms \u201chost cell\u201d and \u201crecombinant host cell\u201d are used interchangeably herein. It is understood that such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term as used herein.",
                                "A host cell can be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example, a target protein of the subject technology can be expressed in bacterial cells such as E. coli, insect cells, yeast or mammalian cells (such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or COS cells). Other suitable host cells are known to those skilled in the art.",
                                "Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. As used herein, the terms \u201ctransformation\u201d and \u201ctransfection\u201d are intended to refer to a variety of art-recognized techniques for introducing foreign nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into a host cell, including calcium phosphate or calcium chloride co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, lipofection, or electroporation. Suitable methods for transforming or transfecting host cells can be found in Sambrook, et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989), and other laboratory manuals.",
                                "For stable transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable target (e.g., resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with the gene of interest. Preferred selectable targets include those which confer resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Nucleic acid encoding a selectable target can be introduced into a host cell on the same vector as that encoding a target protein or can be introduced on a separate vector. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable target gene will survive, while the other cells die).",
                                "A host cell of the subject technology, such as a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell in culture, can be used to produce (i.e., express) a target protein. Accordingly, the subject technology further provides methods for producing a target protein using the host cells of the subject technology. In one embodiment, the method comprises culturing the host cell of subject technology (into which a recombinant expression vector encoding a target protein has been introduced) in a suitable medium such that a target protein of the subject technology is produced. In another embodiment, the method further comprises isolating a target protein from the medium or the host cell. The host cells of the subject technology can also be used to produce non-human transgenic animals. For example, in one embodiment, a host cell of the subject technology is a fertilized oocyte or an embryonic stem cell into which target-protein-coding sequences have been introduced. Such host cells can then be used to create non-human transgenic animals in which exogenous sequences encoding a target protein of the subject technology have been introduced into their genome or homologous recombinant animals in which endogenous sequences encoding the target proteins of the subject technology have been altered. Such animals are useful for studying the function and/or activity of a target protein and for identifying and/or evaluating modulators of target protein activity. As used herein, a \u201ctransgenic animal\u201d is a non-human animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a rodent such as a rat or mouse, in which one or more of the cells of the animal includes a transgene. Other examples of transgenic animals include non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cows, goats, chickens, amphibians, and the like. A transgene is exogenous DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops and which remains in the genome of the mature animal, thereby directing the expression of an encoded gene product in one or more cell types or tissues of the transgenic animal. As used herein, a \u201chomologous recombinant animal\u201d is a non-human animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a mouse, in which an endogenous FKBP1b gene has been altered by homologous recombination between the endogenous gene and an exogenous DNA molecule introduced into a cell of the animal, e.g., an embryonic cell of the animal, prior to development of the animal.",
                                "A transgenic animal of the subject technology can be created by introducing a target-encoding nucleic acid into the male pronuclei of a fertilized oocyte, e.g., by microinjection, retroviral infection, and allowing the oocyte to develop in a pseudopregnant female foster animal. Intronic sequences and polyadenylation signals can also be included in the transgene to increase the efficiency of expression of the transgene. A tissue-specific regulatory sequence(s) can be operably linked to a transgene to direct expression of a target protein to particular cells. Methods for generating transgenic animals via embryo manipulation and microinjection, particularly animals such as mice, have become conventional in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866 and 4,870,009, both by Leder et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 by Wagner et al. and in Hogan, B., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1986). Similar methods are used for production of other transgenic animals. A transgenic founder animal can be identified based upon the presence of a transgene of the subject technology in its genome and/or expression of mRNA corresponding to a gene of the subject technology in tissues or cells of the animals. A transgenic founder animal can then be used to breed additional animals carrying the transgene. Moreover, transgenic animals carrying a transgene encoding a target protein can further be bred to other transgenic animals carrying other transgenes."

Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment, the modulatory method of the subject technology involves contacting a cell with a molecule or agent that modulates the expression or activity of a target protein. A molecule or an agent that modulates the expression or activity of a target protein can be a nucleic acid or a protein, a naturally-occurring target molecule of a target protein (e.g., a target protein substrate), a target protein antibody, a target protein agonist or antagonist, a peptidomimetic of a target protein agonist or antagonist, or other small or large molecules. In one embodiment, the molecule stimulates one or more target protein. Examples of such stimulatory agents include active target protein and a nucleic acid molecule encoding target protein that has been introduced into the cell. In another embodiment, the molecule inhibits one or more target protein activities. Examples of such inhibitory molecules include antisense target protein nucleic acid molecules, anti-target protein antibodies, and target protein inhibitors. These modulatory methods can be performed in vitro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the agent) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g., by administering the agent to a subject). As such, the present subject technology provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with a disease or disorder characterized by aberrant expression or activity of a target protein or nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the method involves administering a molecule or an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein), or combination of agents that modulates (e.g., upregulates or corrects) target protein expression or activity. In another embodiment, the method involves administering a target protein or nucleic acid molecule as therapy to compensate for reduced or aberrant target protein expression or activity.",

                                "An exemplary agent for detecting target protein is an antibody capable of binding to target protein, preferably an antibody with a detectable label. Antibodies can be polyclonal, or more preferably, monoclonal. An intact antibody, or a fragment thereof (eg., Fab or F(ab\u2032)2) can be used. The term \u201clabeled\u201d, with regard to the probe or antibody, is intended to encompass direct labeling of the probe or antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the probe or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with another reagent that is directly labeled. Examples of indirect labeling include detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and end-labeling of a DNA probe with biotin such that it can be detected with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. The term \u201cbiological sample\u201d is intended to include tissues, cells and biological fluids isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. That is, the detection method of the subject technology can be used to detect target mRNA, protein, or genomic DNA in a biological sample in vitro as well as in vivo. For example, in vitro techniques for detection of target mRNA include Northern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. In vitro techniques for detection of target protein include enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), Western blots, immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence. In vitro techniques for detection of target genomic DNA include Southern hybridizations. Furthermore, in vivo techniques for detection of target protein include introducing into a subject a labeled anti-target antibody. For example, the antibody can be labeled with a radioactive target whose presence and location in a subject can be detected by standard imaging techniques.",

Alternatively, the biological sample can contain mRNA molecules from the test subject or genomic DNA molecules from the test subject. A preferred biological sample is a serum sample isolated by conventional means from a subject.",

Thus, an assay which provides a \u201cyes or no\u201d result without necessarily providing quantification of gene expression is within the scope of the subject technology. The subject technology may involve quantitative or qualitative assessment of gene expression.",
                                "Various methods for detecting the level of expression of one or more genes in a sample is known in the art. For example, traditional Northern blotting, nuclease protection, RT-PCR and differential display methods may be used for detecting gene expression levels, including Taqman and flap endonuclease assays. Additional assays include array or chip hybridization-based methods, which are convenient when determining the expression levels of a larger number of genes.",
                                "In some embodiments, the subject technology may employ reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a sensitive method for the detection of mRNA, including low abundant mRNAs present in clinical tissue samples. The application of fluorescence techniques to RT-PCR combined with suitable instrumentation has led to quantitative RT-PCR methods that combine amplification, detection and quantification in a closed system. Two commonly used quantitative RT-PCR techniques are the Taqman RT-PCR assay (ABI, Foster City, USA) and the Lightcycler assay (Roche, USA).",
                                "In other embodiments, the subject technology employs detection and quantification of RNA levels in real-time using nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) combined with molecular beacon detection molecules. NASBA is a singe-step isothermal RNA-specific amplification method that amplifies mRNA in a double stranded DNA environment, and this method has recently proven useful in the detection of various mRNAs, and in the detection of both viral and bacterial RNA in clinical samples.",
                                "In yet other embodiments, the subject technology uses an assay employing a flap endonuclease, such as the Invader\u2122 assay (Third Wave Technologies). In the case of using the invader method, an invader probe containing a sequence specific to the region 3\u2032 to a target site, and a primary probe containing a sequence specific to the region 5\u2032 to the target site of a template and an unrelated flap sequence, are prepared. Cleavase is then allowed to act in the presence of these probes, the target molecule, as well as a FRET probe containing a sequence complementary to the flap sequence and an auto-complementary sequence that is labeled with both a fluorescent dye and a quencher. When the primary probe hybridizes with the template, the 3\u2032 end of the invader probe penetrates the target site, and this structure is cleaved by the Cleavase resulting in dissociation of the flap. The flap binds to the FRET probe and the fluorescent dye portion is cleaved by the Cleavase resulting in emission of fluorescence.",
                                "In another embodiment, the subject technology employs hybridization-based assays. Nucleic acid hybridization simply involves contacting a probe and target nucleic acid under conditions where the probe and its complementary target can form stable hybrid duplexes through complementary base pairing (see Lockhart et al., (1999) WO 99/32660). The nucleic acids that do not form hybrid duplexes are then washed away leaving the hybridized nucleic acids to be detected, typically through detection of an attached detectable label. It is generally recognized that nucleic acids are denatured by increasing the temperature or decreasing the salt concentration of the buffer containing the nucleic acids.",
                                "Under low stringency conditions (e.g., low temperature and/or high salt) hybrid duplexes (e.g., DNA-DNA, RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA) will form even where the annealed sequences are not perfectly complementary. Thus specificity of hybridization is reduced at lower stringency. Conversely, at higher stringency (e.g., higher temperature or lower salt) successful hybridization requires fewer mismatches. One of skill in the art will appreciate that hybridization conditions may be selected to provide any degree of stringency. In a preferred embodiment, hybridization is performed at low stringency, in this case in 6\u00d7SSPE-T at 37\u00b0 C. (0.005% Triton x-100) to ensure hybridization and then subsequent washes are performed at higher stringency (e.g., 1\u00d7SSPE-T at 37\u00b0 C.) to eliminate mismatched hybrid duplexes. Successive washes may be performed at increasingly higher stringency (e.g., down to as low as 0.25\u00d7SSPET at 37\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C.) until a desired level of hybridization specificity is obtained. Stringency can also be increased by addition of agents such as formamide. Hybridization specificity may be evaluated by comparison of hybridization to the test probes with hybridization to the various controls that can be present (e.g., expression level control, normalization control, mismatch controls, etc.).",
                                "The hybridized nucleic acids are typically detected by detecting one or more labels attached to the sample nucleic acids. The labels may be incorporated by any of a number of means well known to those of skill in the art (see Lockhart et al., (1999) WO 99/32660).",
                                "When employing hybridization formats, solution-based and solid support-based assay formats may be employed. Solid supports containing oligonucleotide probes for differentially expressed genes of the subject technology can be filters, polyvinyl chloride dishes, silicon or glass based chips, etc. Such wafers and hybridization methods are widely available, for example, those disclosed by Beattie (WO 95/11755). Any solid surface to which oligonucleotides can be bound, either directly or indirectly, either covalently or non-covalently, can be used. An exemplary solid support is a high density array or DNA chip. These contain a particular oligonucleotide probe in a predetermined location on the array. Each predetermined location may contain more than one molecule of the probe, but each molecule within the predetermined location has an identical sequence. Such predetermined locations are termed features. There may be, for example, about 2, 10, 100, 1000 to 10,000; 100,000 or 400,000 of such features on a single solid support. The solid support, or the area within which the probes are attached may be on the order of a square centimeter.",

Biotechnol. 14, 1675-1680; McGall et al., (1996) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 13555-13460). Such probe arrays may contain at least two or more oligonucleotides that are complementary to or hybridize to two or more of the genes described herein. Such arrays may also contain oligonucleotides that are complementary or hybridize to at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 50, or all of the genes described herein as being differentially expressed in AD.",

Oligonucleotide probes for assaying the tissue or cell sample are preferably of sufficient length to specifically hybridize only to appropriate, complementary genes or transcripts. Typically the oligonucleotide probes will be at least 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 or 25 nucleotides in length. In some cases longer probes of at least 30, 40, or 50 nucleotides will be desirable.",

Such hybridizable oligonucleotides will typically exhibit at least about 75% sequence identity at the nucleotide level to said genes, preferably about 80% or 85% sequence identity or more preferably about 90% or 95% or more sequence identity to said genes. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide probes are identical to a portion of the genes disclosed herein, and usually identical in a range of 10-30 nucleotides, such as 15-20 nucleotides.",

The array will typically include a number of probes that specifically hybridize to the sequences of interest. See WO 99/32660 for methods of producing probes for a given gene or genes. In addition, in a preferred embodiment, the array will include one or more control probes.",

In other particularly preferred embodiments the probes are about 20 to 25 nucleotides in length. In another preferred embodiment, test probes are double or single strand DNA sequences. DNA sequences are isolated or cloned from natural sources or amplified from natural sources using natural nucleic acid as templates. These probes have sequences complementary to particular subsequences of the genes whose expression they are designed to detect. Thus, the test probes are capable of specifically hybridizing to the target nucleic acid they are to detect.",
                                "In addition to test probes that bind the target nucleic acid(s) of interest, the high density array can contain a number of control probes. The control probes fall into three categories referred to herein as (1) normalization controls; (2) expression level controls; and (3) mismatch controls.",
                                "Normalization controls are oligonucleotide or other nucleic acid probes that are complementary to labeled reference oligonucleotides or other nucleic acid sequences that are added to the nucleic acid sample. The signals obtained from the normalization controls after hybridization provide a control for variations in hybridization conditions, label intensity, \u201creading\u201d efficiency and other factors that may cause the signal of a perfect hybridization to vary between arrays. In a preferred embodiment, signals (e.g., fluorescence intensity) read from all other probes in the array are divided by the signal (e.g., fluorescence intensity) from the control probes thereby normalizing the measurements. Other methods for normalizing gene expression data are known in the art, such as those described, for example, in WO2001/020043 or US 20060136145, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.",
                                "Virtually any probe may serve as a normalization control. However, it is recognized that hybridization efficiency varies with base composition and probe length. Preferred normalization probes are selected to reflect the average length of the other probes present in the array, however, they can be selected to cover a range of lengths. The normalization control(s) can also be selected to reflect the (average) base composition of the other probes in the array, however in a preferred embodiment, only one or a few probes are used and they are selected such that they hybridize well (i.e., no secondary structure) and do not match any target-specific probes.",
                                "Expression level controls are probes that hybridize specifically with constitutively expressed genes in the biological sample. Virtually any constitutively expressed gene provides a suitable target for expression level controls. Typical expression level control probes have sequences complementary to subsequences of constitutively expressed \u201chousekeeping genes\u201d including, but not limited to the beta-actin gene, the transferrin receptor gene, the GAPDH gene, the HPRT1 gene, and the like. Alternatively or in addition, the expression level controls can be obtained from genes whose expressions are known not to change with AD.",
                                "Mismatch controls may also be provided for the probes to the target genes, for expression level controls or for normalization controls. Mismatch controls are oligonucleotide probes or other nucleic acid probes identical to their corresponding test or control probes except for the presence of one or more mismatched bases. A mismatched base is a base selected so that it is not complementary to the corresponding base in the target sequence to which the probe would otherwise specifically hybridize. One or more mismatches are selected such that under appropriate hybridization conditions (e.g., stringent conditions) the test or control probe would be expected to hybridize with its target sequence, but the mismatch probe would not hybridize (or would hybridize to a significantly lesser extent). Preferred mismatch probes contain a central mismatch. Thus, for example, where a probe is a twenty-mer, a corresponding mismatch probe will have the identical sequence except for a single base mismatch (e.g., substituting a G, a C or a T for an A) at any of positions 6 through 14 (the central mismatch).",
                                "Mismatch probes thus provide a control for non-specific binding or cross hybridization to a nucleic acid in the sample other than the target to which the probe is directed. Mismatch probes also indicate whether a hybridization is specific or not. For example, if the target is present the perfect match probes should be consistently brighter than the mismatch probes. In addition, if all central mismatches are present, the mismatch probes can be used to detect a mutation. The difference in intensity between the perfect match and the mismatch probe (IBM)-I(MM)) provides a good measure of the concentration of the hybridized material.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the obtained expression profile of a biological sample from a subject at risk of AD is compared to a single reference profile (e.g., that of an individual known not to have AD or that of a universal control sample obtained from healthy individuals) to obtain information regarding the phenotype (e.g., positive or negative test of early-stage AD) of the sample being assayed. In yet other embodiments, the obtained expression profile is compared to two or more different reference profiles (e.g., that of individuals known not to have AD or that of two or more universal control samples from healthy individuals) to obtain more in depth information regarding the phenotype of the assayed sample. For example, the obtained expression profile may be compared to a positive and negative reference profile to obtain confirmed information regarding whether the sample has the phenotype of interest (e.g., indications for early-stage AD or being at risk of developing AD).",

For example, a reference expression level can be a predetermined standard reference level of expression in order to evaluate if expression of a biomarker or biomarker set is informative and make an assessment for determining whether the patient tests positive or negative for AD or risk of developing AD. Additionally, determining the level of expression of a biomarker can be compared to an internal reference marker level of expression which is measured at the same time as the biomarker in order to make an assessment for determining whether the patient tests positive or negative for AD or risk of developing AD. For example, expression of a distinct marker panel which is not comprised of biomarkers of the subject technology, but which is known to demonstrate a constant expression level can be assessed as an internal reference marker level, and the level of the biomarker expression is determined as compared to the reference. In an alternative example, expression of the selected biomarkers in a tissue sample which is a non-AD sample can be assessed as an internal reference marker level. The level of expression of a biomarker may be determined as having increased expression in certain aspects. The level of expression of a biomarker may be determined as having decreased expression in other aspects. The level of expression may be determined as no informative change in expression as compared to a reference level. In still other aspects, the level of expression is determined against a pre-determined standard expression level as determined by the methods provided in, for example, WO2012037378, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.",

For example, such methods can be used to determine whether a subject can be effectively treated with an agent for a disorder such as AD or other cognitive impairments. Thus, the present subject technology provides methods for determining whether a subject can be effectively treated with an agent for a disorder associated with increased or decreased target expression or activity in which a test sample is obtained and target protein or nucleic acid expression or activity is detected (e.g., wherein the abundance of target protein or nucleic acid expression or activity is diagnostic for a subject that can be administered the agent to treat a disorder associated with increased or decreased target expression or activity).",

                                "Young-adult male F344 rats were anesthetized in a CO2 chamber before rapid decapitation. Our sharp-electrode electrophysiological methods have been described previously (Thibault et al., 2001; Gant et al., 2006). Briefly, intracellular recordings were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices (350-+m-thick) maintained in oxygenated ACSF (in mM: 128 NaCl, 1.25 KH2PO4, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO3, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, and 2 MgCl2), using sharp glass pipettes filled with HEPES (10 mM), KMeSO4 (2 M), and Calcium Orange tetrapotassium salt (5 mM; Invitrogen). Electrophysiological data were acquired and analyzed using pClamp 8, a sharp-electrode amplifier (Axoclamp 2B), and a DigiData 1320 board (Molecular Devices). Voltage records were digitized at 2-20 kHz and low-pass-filtered at 1 kHz. Input resistance and AHP measures were obtained in current-clamp mode. AHP duration and sAHP amplitude were measured after four Na+ APs triggered by an intracellular depolarizing pulse. The 5 mM concentration of Ca2+ indicator used is in a range commonly used in slice imaging experiments (Jaffe et al., 1992; Brown and Jaffe, 1994; Jaffe and Brown, 1994) and apparently does not distort AHP waveforms or obscure aging differences in the AHP (Thibault et al., 2001; Gant et al., 2006).",
                                "Ca2+ Imaging.",
                                "Methods used were similar to those described previously by several groups (Miyakawa et al., 1992; Brown and Jaffe, 1994; Jaffe and Brown, 1994; Magee and Johnston, 1995; Thibault et al., 2001; Gant et al., 2006). Individual CA1 neurons impaled with sharp pipettes and loaded with the Cu2+ indicator Calcium Orange were imaged on the stage of a Nikon E600 microscope equipped with a 40 water immersion objective and a CCD camera (Roper Scientific/Princeton Instruments). Calcium Orange was allowed to diffuse into the cell for at least 10 min before Ca2+ fluorescence measures were performed. Calcium Orange was excited using a wavelength switcher (Sutter Instruments Lambda DG-4) and software control (Axon Imaging Workbench; version 2.2.1.54; Molecular Devices). The 575 nm wavelength was monitored through a dichroic mirror centered at 570 nm during excitation with the 550 nm wavelength. The intracellular Ca2+ response was elicited by 10 s of 7 Hz repetitive synaptic stimulation (RSS) delivered to the Schaffer collaterals via bipolar stimulation electrode. Stimulation intensity was set at AP threshold and generated an action potential on essentially each pulse (Thibault et al., 2001). Ca2+ responses were measured in a region of interest corresponding to the visible outline of the cell soma, excluding surrounding low-intensity diffracted light. Although the central region of the neuron appears brighter (see FIG. 6, inset), this may be related in part to greater indicator loading in this thicker central region of the cell (Tsien, 1988; Nicotera et al., 1994). After background subtraction from an area devoid of cells adjacent Co the recorded cell, percentage change in fluorescence was determined relative to baseline (% F/F). Optical sampling rate averaged +5 Hz, which appeared sufficiently sensitive to detect significant changes in the Ca2+ response. Excitation of Calcium Orange was essentially continuous during a 10 s train of RSS, but control runs showed that bleaching was minimal (+0.21+0.09% at 5 s RSS; +0.69+0.35% at 10 s RSS; n+7 cells). The ryanodine-sensitive component (CICR component) of the Cu2+ response was determined by subtracting the post-ryanodine Ca2+ response from the pre-ryanodine response [(pre-ryanodine % \u0394F/F)\u2212(post-ryanodine % \u0394F/F)=ryanodine sensitive component].",

Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD) test was used for post hoc group comparisons. p values+0.05 were considered significant.",
                                "This microinjection results in overexpression of FKBP1b mRNA and protein (confirmed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry). The electrophysiological effects of unilateral microinjection into one hippocampus of aging rats of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector containing the open reading frame (ORF) of the Fkbp1b gene is shown in FIG. 1. The quantitative group measures (mean+/\u2212SEM) of intracellular electrode recordings of membrane voltage responses that are well-established to vary in magnitude with the amount of calcium released by intracellular ryanodine receptors (see Gant et al, 2006). As shown in FIG. 1, the voltage responses obtained in this study are the amplitude of the calcium-dependent medium afterhyperpolarization (mAHP)(top panel), amplitude of the calcium-dependent slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP)(middle panel), and duration of the calcium-dependent slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) (bottom panel). The data reveal significant differences in these responses in neurons recorded from the viral vector-injected hippocampus vs. those recorded from the control (non-injected) hippocampus, such that the injected-side neurons exhibit a younger phenotype (lesser magnitude). Larger amplitude AHPs develop with aging and have been correlated with impaired memory.",
