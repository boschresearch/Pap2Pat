                        "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are an important class of proteins involved in nearly every aspect of RNA biology, including but not limited to the regulation of RNA stability, localization, and translational efficiency. There are currently thousands of RBPs with many more yet to be identified and characterized. Understanding the function of an RBP largely relies on determining what RNAs it binds. Current methods to characterize these interactions have predominately relied on Cross-Linking followed by Immuno-Precipitation (CLIP) based technologies. While these technologies have been instrumental in the characterization of hundreds of RBPs, the methods are cumbersome and low throughput."
