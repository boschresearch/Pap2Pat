                        "Normally, mammalian lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in the cytosol and traverse the ER where they are glycosylated with N-linked, high mannose type carbohydrate. In the golgi, the high mannose carbohydrate is modified on lysosomal proteins by the addition of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) which targets these proteins to the lysosome. The M6P-modified proteins are delivered to the lysosome via interaction with either of two M6P receptors. The most favorable form of modification is when two M6Ps are added to a high mannose carbohydrate.",
                        "More than forty lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused, directly or indirectly, by the absence of one or more lysosomal enzymes in the lysosome Enzyme replacement therapy for LSDs is being actively pursued. Therapy generally requires that LSD proteins be taken up and delivered to the lysosomes of a variety of cell types in an M6P-dependent fashion. One possible approach involves purifying an LSD protein and modifying it to incorporate a carbohydrate moiety with M6P. This modified material may be taken up by the cells more efficiently than unmodified LSD proteins due to interaction with M6P receptors on the cell surface.",
                        "The inventors of the present application have previously developed a peptide-based targeting technology that allows more efficient delivery of therapeutic enzymes to the lysosomes. This proprietary technology is termed Glycosylation Independent Lysosomal Targeting (GILT) because a peptide tag replaces M6P as the moiety targeting the lysosomes.

Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. Preferably, the WU-BLAST-2 software is used to determine amino acid sequence identity (Altschul et al., Methods in Enzymology 266, 460-480 (1996); http://blast.wustUedu/blast/README.html). WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable parameters are set with the following values; overlap span=1, overlap fraction=0.125, world threshold (T)=11. HSP score (S) and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself, depending upon the composition of the particular sequence, however, the minimum values may be adjusted and are set as indicated above."

Residual GAA activity correlates with both the amount and tissue distribution of glycogen accumulation as well as the severity of the disease. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (less than 1% of normal GAA activity) is the most severe form and is characterized by hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and massive glycogen accumulation in cardiac and other muscle tissues. Death usually occurs within one year of birth due to cardiorespiratory failure. Hirschhorn et al.

Juvenile-onset (1-10% of normal GAA activity) and adult-onset (10-40% of normal GAA activity) Pompe disease are more clinically heterogeneous, with greater variation in age of onset, clinical presentation, and disease progression. Juvenile- and adult-onset Pompe disease are generally characterized by lack of severe cardiac involvement, later age of onset, and slower disease progression, but eventual respiratory or limb muscle involvement results in significant morbidity and mortality. While life expectancy can vary, death generally occurs due to respiratory failure. Hirschhorn et al.

As the blood perfuses patient tissues, enzyme is taken up by cells and transported to the lysosome, where the enzyme acts to eliminate material that has accumulated in the lysosomes due to the enzyme deficiency. For lysosomal enzyme replacement therapy to be effective, the therapeutic enzyme must be delivered to lysosomes in the appropriate cells in tissues where the storage defect is manifest. Conventional lysosomal enzyme replacement therapeutics are delivered using carbohydrates naturally attached to the protein to engage specific receptors on the surface of the target cells. One receptor, the cation-independent M6P receptor (CI-MPR), is particularly useful for targeting replacement lysosomal enzymes because the CI-MPR is present on the surface of most cell types.",

Furin protease typically recognizes and cleaves a cleavage site having a consensus sequence Arg-X-X-Arg (SEQ ID NO: 2), X is any amino acid. The cleavage site is positioned after the carboxy-terminal arginine (Arg) residue in the sequence. In some embodiments, a furin cleavage site has a consensus sequence Lys/Arg-X-X-X-Lys/Arg-Arg (SEQ ID NO: 3), X is any amino acid. The cleavage site is positioned after the carboxy-terminal arginine (Arg) residue in the sequence. As used herein, the term \u201cfurin\u201d refers to any protease that can recognize and cleave the furin protease cleavage site as defined herein, including furin or furin-like protease. Furin is also known as paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (PACE). Furin belongs to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family that includes PC3, a protease responsible for maturation of proinsulin in pancreatic islet cells. The gene encoding furin was known as FUR (FES Upstream Region).",

Specifically, furin-resistant GILT tags can be designed by mutating the amino acid sequence at one or more furin cleavage sites such that the mutation abolishes at least one furin cleavage site. Thus, in some embodiments, a furin-resistant GILT tag is a furin-resistant IGF-II mutein containing a mutation that abolishes at least one furin protease cleavage site or changes a sequence adjacent to the furin protease cleavage site such that the furin cleavage is prevented, inhibited, reduced or slowed down as compared to a wild-type IGF-II peptide (e.g., wild-type human mature IGF-II). Typically, a suitable mutation does not impact the ability of the furin-resistant GILT tag to bind to the human cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. In particular, a furin-resistant IGF-II mutein suitable for the invention binds to the human cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor in a mannose-6-phosphate-independent manner with a dissociation constant of 10\u22127 M or less (e.g., 10\u22128, 10\u22129, 10\u221210, 10\u221211, or less) at pH 7.4. In some embodiments, a furin-resistant IGF-II mutein contains a mutation within a region corresponding to amino acids 30-40 (e.g., 31-40, 32-40, 33-40, 34-40, 30-39, 31-39, 32-39, 34-37, 32-39, 33-39, 34-39, 35-39, 36-39, 37-40, 34-40) of SEQ ID NO:1. In some embodiments, a suitable mutation abolishes at least one furin protease cleavage site. A mutation can be amino acid substitutions, deletions, insertions. For example, any one amino acid within the region corresponding to residues 30-40 (e.g., 31-40, 32-40, 33-40, 34-40, 30-39, 31-39, 32-39, 34-37, 32-39, 33-39, 34-39, 35-39, 36-39, 37-40, 34-40) of SEQ ID NO:1 can be substituted with any other amino acid or deleted. For example, substitutions at position 34 may affect furin recognition of the first cleavage site. Insertion of one or more additional amino acids within each recognition site may abolish one or both furin cleavage sites. Deletion of one or more of the residues in the degenerate positions may also abolish both furin cleavage sites.",

Particularly useful are mutations in the IGF-II polypeptide that result in a protein that binds the CI-MPR with high affinity (e.g., with a dissociation constant of 10\u22127 M or less at pH 7.4) while binding other receptors known to be bound by IGF-II with reduced affinity relative to native IGF-II. For example, a furin-resistant mutein suitable for the invention can be modified to have diminished binding affinity for the IGF-I receptor relative to the affinity of naturally-occurring human IGF-II for the IGF-I receptor. For example, substitution of IGF-II residues Tyr 27 with Leu, Leu 43 with Val or Ser 26 with Phe diminishes the affinity of IGF-II for the IGF-I receptor by 94-, 56-, and 4-fold respectively (Torres et al. (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 248(2):385-401). Deletion of residues 1-7 of human IGF-II resulted in a 30-fold decrease in affinity for the human IGF-I receptor and a concomitant 12 fold increase in affinity for the rat IGF-II receptor (Hashimoto et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270(30):18013-8). The NMR structure of IGF-II shows that Thr 7 is located near residues 48 Phe and 50 Ser as well as near the 9 Cys-47 Cys disulfide bridge. It is thought that interaction of Thr 7 with these residues can stabilize the flexible N-terminal hexapeptide required for IGF-I receptor binding (Terasawa et al. (1994) EMBO J. 13(23)5590-7). At the same time this interaction can modulate binding to the IGF-II receptor. Truncation of the C-terminus of IGF-II (residues 62-67) also appear to lower the affinity of IGF-II for the IGF-I receptor by 5 fold (Roth et al. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 181(2):907-14).",
                                "The binding surfaces for the IGF-I and cation-independent M6P receptors are on separate faces of IGF-II. Based on structural and mutational data, functional cation-independent M6P binding domains can be constructed that are substantially smaller than human IGF-II. For example, the amino terminal amino acids (e.g., 1-7 or 2-7) and/or the carboxy terminal residues 62-67 can be deleted or replaced. Additionally, amino acids 29-40 can likely be eliminated or replaced without altering the folding of the remainder of the polypeptide or binding to the cation-independent M6P receptor. Thus, a targeting moiety including amino acids 8-28 and 41-61 can be constructed. These stretches of amino acids could perhaps be joined directly or separated by a linker. Alternatively, amino acids 8-28 and 41-61 can be provided on separate polypeptide chains. Comparable domains of insulin, which is homologous to IGF-II and has a tertiary structure closely related to the structure of IGF-II, have sufficient structural information to permit proper refolding into the appropriate tertiary structure, even when present in separate polypeptide chains (Wang et al. (1991) Trends Biochem. Sci. 279-281). Thus, for example, amino acids 8-28, or a conservative substitution variant thereof, could be fused to a lysosomal enzyme; the resulting fusion protein could be admixed with amino acids 41-61, or a conservative substitution variant thereof, and administered to a patient.",
                                "IGF-II can also be modified to minimize binding to serum IGF-binding proteins (Baxter (2000) Am. J. Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 278(6):967-76) to avoid sequestration of IGF-II/GILT constructs. A number of studies have localized residues in IGF-II necessary for binding to IGF-binding proteins. Constructs with mutations at these residues can be screened for retention of high affinity binding to the M6P/IGF-II receptor and for reduced affinity for IGF-binding proteins. For example, replacing Phe 26 of IGF-II with Ser is reported to reduce affinity of IGF-II for IGFBP-1 and -6 with no effect on binding to the M6P/IGF-II receptor (Bach et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268(13):9246-54). Other substitutions, such as Lys for Glu 9, can also be advantageous. The analogous mutations, separately or in combination, in a region of IGF-I that is highly conserved with IGF-II result in large decreases in IGF-BP binding (Magee et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38(48):15863-70).",
                                "An alternate approach is to identify minimal regions of IGF-II that can bind with high affinity to the M6P/IGF-II receptor. The residues that have been implicated in IGF-II binding to the M6P/IGF-II receptor mostly cluster on one face of IGF-II (Terasawa et al. (1994) EMBO J. 13(23):5590-7). Although IGF-II tertiary structure is normally maintained by three intramolecular disulfide bonds, a peptide incorporating the amino acid sequence on the M6P/IGF-II receptor binding surface of IGF-II can be designed to fold properly and have binding activity. Such a minimal binding peptide is a highly preferred lysosomal targeting domain. For example, a preferred lysosomal targeting domain is amino acids 8-67 of human IGF-II. Designed peptides, based on the region around amino acids 48-55, which bind to the M6P/IGF-II receptor, are also desirable lysosomal targeting domains. Alternatively, a random library of peptides can be screened for the ability to bind the M6P/IGF-II receptor either via a yeast two hybrid assay, or via a phage display type assay."

Variations in the IGF-II sequence can be made, for example, using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non-conservative mutations set forth, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,934. Variations may be a substitution, deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding IGF-II that results in a change in the amino acid sequence of IGF-II as compared with a naturally-occurring sequence of mature human IGF-II. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements. Amino acid substitutions can also be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having dissimilar structural and/or chemical properties, i.e., non-conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of 1 to 5 amino acids.

In some embodiments, a protein may be completely underglycosylated (as when synthesized in E. coli), partially unglycosylated (as when synthesized in a mammalian system after disruption of one or more glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis), or may have a non-mammalian glycosylation pattern. For example, underglycosylated fusion proteins may be generated by modifying, substituting or eliminating one or more glycosylation sites by site-directed mutagenesis. For example, wild-type GAA typically have seven sites that match the canonical recognition sequence for N-linked glycosylation, Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser (SEQ ID NO: 7) (Xaa can be any residue except Pro), namely, Asn-140, -233, -390, -470, -652, -882 and -925 (Hoefsloot et al., 1988; Martiniuk et al., 1990b). One or more Asn at the above described positions may be changed or eliminated to generated underglycosylated GAA. In some embodiments, Asn may be changed to Gln.",
                                "In some embodiments, a therapeutic fusion protein can be deglycosylated after synthesis. For example, deglycosylation can be through chemical or enzymatic treatments, and may lead to complete deglycosylation or, if only a portion of the carbohydrate structure is removed, partial deglycosylation.",
                                "In some embodiments, glycosylation of a lysosomal enzyme is modified, e.g., by oxidation and reduction, to reduce clearance of the therapeutic protein from the blood. For example, a lysosomal enzyme can be deglycosylated by periodate treatment. In particular, treatment with periodate and a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride is effective to modify the carbohydrate structure of most glycoproteins. Periodate treatment oxidizes vicinal diols, cleaving the carbon-carbon bond and replacing the hydroxyl groups with aldehyde groups; borohydride reduces the aldehydes to hydroxyls. For example, at 1 mM concentration, periodate exclusively oxidizes sialic acid groups and at or above 10 mM all available vicinal diols are converted to aldehydes (Herrnanson, G. T. 1996, Bioconjugate techniques. Academic press). Once formed, aldehyde groups are highly reactive and may form Schiff's base linkages with primary amino groups in the protein resulting intramolecular linkages. Therefore, aldehyde groups formed ought to be reduced to alcohol groups. A commonly used reducing agent is NaBH4 and the reaction is best run under alkaline conditions. Many sugar residues including vicinal diols, therefore, are cleaved by this treatment. Nevertheless, while this treatment converts cyclic carbohydrates into linear carbohydrates, it does not completely remove the carbohydrate, minimizing risks of exposing potentially protease-sensitive or antigenic polypeptide sites.",
                                "Grubb, J. H., et al (Grubb et al, 2008, PNAS 105:26(6) report treatment of human 8-glucuronidase with sodium metaperiodate followed by sodium borohydride reduction. The modified beta-glucuronidase retained 90% of activity, but lost both mannose and mannose-6-phosphate dependent receptor uptake activity. The alkaline pH condition used in the reduction due to sodium borohydride reagent as described by Grubb et al is not suitable for all lysosomal enzymes, many of which are labile under alkaline conditions.",
                                "Therefore, in some embodiments, sodium cyanoborohydride is used as reducing agent. While the rate of reduction of aldehydes by cyanoborohydride is negligible at neutral pH and above, the rate of reaction becomes rapid at acidic pH (Borch, et al. 1971, JACS 93:2897). For example, regimens using sodium metaperiodate and cyanoborohydride at pH 3.5-4 can be used.",
                                "For example, treatment of GAA or alpha galactosidase A, the enzymes deficient in Pompe and Fabry diseases respectively, with periodate and cyanoborohydride at pH 5.6 resulted in good recovery of enzyme activity. Enzyme was incubated with equal volume mixture containing 20 mM sodium metaperiodate and 40 mM sodium cyanoborohydride in 0.1 M Na acetate, pH 5.6 for 60 min on ice. The unreacted periodate was quenched with glycerol (10% final concentration) for 15 min on ice. The proteins were finally exchanged into phosphate buffered saline, pH 6.2 by diafiltration using Amicon centrifugal filter devices. Other reducing reagents for example, dimethylamine borane, may also be useful to reduce aldehydes generated by sodium metaperiodate oxidation of glycoproteins such as GAA under acidic conditions.",
                                "Thus, in some embodiments, the reduction of sodium metaperiodate treated GAA involves use of sodium cyanoborohydride at acidic pH from pH 3.0 to pH 6. Optimal conditions for the chemical modification can be readily determined by using two assays: loss of binding to ConA sepharose, and diminished uptake into J774E macrophage.",
                                "For example, the ability of periodate/borohydride modified \u03b2-glucuronidase to bind to ConA-sepharose was compared to that of untreated \u03b2-glucuronidase. The enzymes were incubated with 50 \u03bcl ConA beads in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 M NaCl for 15 min at room temperature. Beads were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 sec. Supernatant (flow through) was carefully withdrawn, assayed for GUS activity and analyzed by SDS/PAGE. When we treated GUS exactly as reported in Grubb et al., 60% ConA binding activity was lost and unbound GUS was present only in the flow through of periodate treated and subsequently sodium borohydride reduced sample.",

ZC-701 is a chimeric protein that contains an N-terminal IGF-II based GILT tag fused via a three amino acid spacer to residues 70-952 of human acid-\u03b1-glucosidase (hGAA). Specifically, ZC-701 includes amino acids 1 and 8-67 of human IGF-II (i.e., \u03942-7 of mature human IGF-II), the spacer sequence Gly-Ala-Pro, and amino acids 70-952 of human GAA. The full length amino acid sequence is shown below. The spacer sequence is bolded. The sequence N-terminal to the spacer sequence reflects amino acids 1 and 8-67 of human IGF-II and the sequence C-terminal to the spacer sequence reflects amino acids 70-952 of human GAA. The two potential overlapping furin cleavage sites within the IGF-II tag sequence is bolded and underlined. Arrows point to two potential furin cleavage positions.",

N-terminal analysis of ZC-701 batch 10-2-F45-54 revealed the presence of two n-terminal sequences. One conformed to the predicted n-terminus of ZC-701 indicating the presence of the predicted ZC-701 protein. The other n-terminal sequence aligned with sequence within the tag portion of ZC-701 indicating the presence of a derivative of ZC-701 consistent with an endoproteolytic cleavage at amino acid residue 34 of ZC-701. Based on the estimated molar ratios of the two n-termini, this batch of ZC-701 was found to have about a 1:1 ratio of intact and cleaved species.",

One batch, previously shown to have low uptake activity, displayed a set of n-termini indicative of additional proteolysis. We concluded that the proteolytic event responsible for the second species in all of our batches of ZC-70I was perpetrated by furin or a furin-like protease.",

The first of the N-termini is the site of signal peptide cleavage, which yields the predicted n-terminus of ZC-701. The second boxed residue is the site of an undesired proteolytic cleavage event. The amino acid sequence proximal to the cleavage site is Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg (SEQ ID NO: 9). This matches the canonical cleavage site of a protease present in CHO cells called furin, which cleaves after Arg-X-X-Arg (SEQ ID NO: 10). Furin is a member of a family of prohormone convertases that includes PC3, a protease responsible for maturation of proinsulin in pancreatic islet cells. In fact the PC3 cleavage site in proinsulin is conserved and identical to the site at which furin cleaves the IGF-II tag.",
                                "The Furin cleaved ZC-701 differs in molecular weight from intact ZC-701 by about 3000 daltons, which represents less than a 3% difference in molecular weight. Due to the heterogeneity of the oligosaccharide in the protein, the presence of the cleaved ZC-701 was not previously detected by SDS-PAGE. However, if ZC-701 is first deglycosylated by treatment with Peptide N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F), then the cleaved protein can be resolved from the intact ZC-701 by SDS-PAGE.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 2, lane 1 of the SDS-PAGE gel shows the electrophoretic pattern of deglycosylated purified ZC-701. Two bands are evident. The upper band is believed to be intact ZC-701 and the lower band is believed to be furin cleaved ZC-701. To prove that the lower band is indeed Furin cleaved ZC-701, same proteins loaded in lane I were first treated with furin and then loaded in lane 2. As shown in FIG. 2, all of the proteins in lane 2 co-migrates with the lower band in lane 1 indicating that the lower band is in fact furin cleaved ZC-701.",
                                "We have estimated the proportion of ZC-701 that has been cleaved with furin in a number of batches of ZC-701 by quantification of the band intensity in SDS-PAGE and by quantification of amino acids released in N-terminal sequencing experiments. As discussed above, the fraction of cleaved ZC-701 has ranged from 20% to 50% in different batches."
