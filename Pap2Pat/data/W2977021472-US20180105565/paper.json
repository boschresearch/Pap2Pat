    "title": "Dominant-negative ATF5 rapidly depletes survivin in tumor cells",
    "date": "2019-09-24",
    "abstract": "Survivin (BIRC5, product of the BIRC5 gene) is highly expressed in many tumor types and has been widely identified as a potential target for cancer therapy. However, effective anti-survivin drugs remain to be developed. Here we report that both vector-delivered and cell-penetrating dominant-negative (dn) forms of the transcription factor ATF5 that promote selective death of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo cause survivin depletion in tumor cell lines of varying origins. dn-ATF5 decreases levels of both survivin mRNA and protein. The depletion of survivin protein appears to be driven at least in part by enhanced proteasomal turnover and depletion of the deubiquitinase USP9X. Survivin loss is rapid and precedes the onset of cell death triggered by dn-ATF5. Although survivin downregulation is sufficient to drive tumor cell death, survivin over-expression does not rescue cancer cells from dn-ATF5-promoted apoptosis. This indicates that dn-ATF5 kills malignant cells by multiple mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, survivin depletion. Cell-penetrating forms of dn-ATF5 are currently being developed for potential therapeutic use and the present findings suggest that they may pose an advantage over treatments that target only survivin.",

                "The transcription factor ATF5 is over-expressed in a variety of cancer types and such over-expression correlates with poor prognosis and treatment resistance1\u201318. ATF5 is a member of the activating transcription factor family and possesses a basic leucine zipper domain that is required for association with selected partners as well as DNA binding and transcriptional activity2\u20134,19\u201322. To interfere with ATF5 function, we developed a dominant-negative (dn) form of this protein that retains the native leucine zipper, but is N-terminally truncated and modified in the basic domain to abolish DNA binding and to potentially extend the leucine zipper23. When expressed in tumor cells in vitro or in vivo, dn-ATF5 promotes their apoptotic death and causes tumor regression2\u20134,9,10,13,24. To generate a dn-ATF5 with therapeutic potential, we designed a form fused to a cell-penetrating \u201cpenetratin\u201d25 domain that can be produced either as a recombinant protein26 or by synthesis27. The presence of the cell-penetrating domain permits the penetratin-dn-ATF5 fusion peptide (CP-dn-ATF5) to rapidly pass through tissue barriers and to enter cells26. Both recombinant and synthetic forms of CP-dn-ATF5 effectively promote apoptosis of a wide variety of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo26,27. In contrast, neither plasmid nor penetratin delivered dn-ATF5 appears to affect survival of non-transformed cells and there have been no evident side-effects in mice treated with either the recombinant or synthetic forms of CP-dn-ATF5 at doses that suppress tumor growth2,24,26,27.",
                "The mechanisms by which dn-ATF5 promotes tumor cell death are only partially understood. dn-ATF5 decreases levels of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1 in tumor cells by what appears to be both decreased transcription and elevated protein destabilization5,27,28. A preliminary survey of additional proteins that regulate cell survival and death indicated that dn-ATF5 may also affect expression of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP) family member survivin (BIRC5, product of the BIRC5 gene). Like ATF5, survivin is highly expressed in multiple tumor types with little expression in most non-transformed cells29. High survivin expression in tumors is correlated with metastasis, resistance to treatment and poor prognosis30,31. In addition to its action as an inhibitor of apoptosis, biological roles for survivin that also appear to contribute to its actions in tumors include regulation of cell cycle and promotion of mitochondrial function31. Agents that directly or indirectly down-regulate survivin levels interfere with the proliferation of cancer cells and promote their apoptotic death and thus, given survivin\u2019s absence from most non-transformed cells, it has been widely considered as an attractive potential target for cancer treatment30\u201336. Consequently, there has been substantial effort to identify/generate agents that suppress survivin expression in neoplasias31,33\u201336. To date, no such drug has reached clinical use beyond trials, neither as a mono- or combination therapy. Thus there is a continued need to identify agents that affect survivin expression and that have the potential to be used as safe cancer therapeutics."

As an initial approach to assessing the potential effect of dn-ATF5 on survivin expression, we transfected PC3 prostate tumor cells with a previously described construct expressing GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF523 and determined total survivin levels by western immunoblotting after 3 days (Fig. 1a). This revealed an approximate 40% loss of survivin protein expression (not accounting for a transfection efficiency of 50\u201370%).Fig. 1Transfection with GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF5 depletes survivin protein prior to onset of cell death.a Transfection with GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF5 depletes survivin in PC3 prostate tumor cells.

Scale bar\u2009=\u200910\u2009\u00b5m. c, d Transfection with GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF5 depletes nuclear-only localized survivin and increases the proportion of cells without detectable survivin expression in T89G and LN229 cultures at 24\u2009h (C) or at 3\u20135 d (D). Transfected cells (GFP+) were blindly scored for survivin localization using criteria described in panel b. Data are from three independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate.

                        "Similar results were achieved by transfecting T98G glioblastoma cells with 3xFLAG-dn-ATF5 (Supplementary Fig. 1). We also carried out a parallel transfection with a mutated form of this construct in which the critical leucine residues in the leucine zipper were replaced with glycine residues. We previously found that such replacements in a dn form of ATF5 compromises its capacity to promote cell death27. In contrast to the non-mutated construct, the mutant construct failed to down-regulate survivin (Supplementary Fig. 1). Taken together, these findings indicate that dn-ATF5 reduces survivin expression in tumor cells and that this requires a functional leucine zipper domain.",
                        "To further assess effects of dn-ATF5 on survivin expression and localization at the cellular level, we transfected T98G and LN229 glioblastoma cells with a GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF5 construct or with a control plasmid expressing only GFP. One day after transfection, transfected (GFP+) cells were immunostained for survivin expression and blindly scored for proportions with either no, cytoplasmic/nuclear (cells with evident survivin expression in both nuclei and cytoplasm) or nuclear-only localized survivin (Fig. 1b). In both lines, about 60% of control cells showed nuclear-only localization, about 25% cytoplasmic/nuclear staining and about 15% no detectable survivin staining (Fig. 1c). In contrast, there was an approximate 3-fold increase in proportion of cells without detectable survivin expression (to almost 50% of the population) (Fig. 1c) after transfection with GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF5. This appeared to come mainly at the expense of nuclear survivin for which there was a corresponding loss in proportion of cells with immunostaining in this compartment (Fig. 1c). These effects were sustained in that they were also evident 3\u20135 days after transfection (Fig. 1d).",
                        "As noted above, dn-ATF5 expression triggers extensive apoptotic death of tumor cells. This raised the question as to whether survivin depletion might either precede or be a result of the death process. We therefore monitored the proportions of cells with apoptotic nuclei at 1\u20135 days after transfection. In agreement with prior findings2, this revealed no increase in apoptosis compared to controls at 24\u2009h after transfection (Fig. 1e), a time when survivin expression was already diminished. This contrasted with later times when both loss of survivin and increased apoptotic death were apparent (Fig. 1f). Thus, survivin appears to be lost prior to the appearance of apoptotic nuclei and to be sustained during the death process."

CP-dn-ATF5 has the advantage that it rapidly reaches all cells in cultures and that the effects on survivin can therefore be readily quantified.

Dose-dependent reductions in survivin protein were seen in all lines at 24\u2009h and persisted for the 3 days of treatment with a range of responses, reaching survivin depletion of over 90% in some cases (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2).",

There was no significant effect at 4\u2009h, but reduction of survivin levels was evident at 8\u2009h and beyond (Fig. 2d). To determine whether this depletion of survivin might be the result of cell death, we also assessed cell viability over time and confirmed no loss of cells at 24\u2009h with death evident only at 48 and 72\u2009h (Fig. 2e).

Despite expression of the protein from a heterologous promoter, exposure to 100\u2009\u00b5M CP-dn-ATF5 for 3 d caused substantial reduction in expression of the exogenous survivin protein in all lines tested (Fig. 4a).

Prior reports indicate that cellular survivin levels are subject to post-transcriptional regulation by degradation39,40. To assess whether CP-dn-ATF5 affects survivin stability, we pretreated T98G cells with or without this peptide for 24\u2009h and then exposed them to the translational inhibitor cycloheximide for various times before determining relative survivin protein levels by western immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4b, c, this revealed that CP-dn-ATF5 significantly accelerates survivin turnover under conditions when survivin synthesis is blocked. These findings thus indicate that survivin depletion caused by dn-ATF5 likely reflects decreased survivin protein stability.",
                        "To approach the issue of the mechanism by which dn-ATF5 affects survivin stability, we generated T98G cells stably over-expressing FLAG-survivin on a heterologous promoter. To determine whether the post-translational component of the effect of CP-dn-ATF5 on survivin is mediated by the proteasome, we exposed the survivin over-expressing cells to 100\u2009\u00b5M CP-dn-ATF5 for 24\u2009h in presence or absence of the proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin (Fig. 5a). Under such circumstances, FLAG-survivin levels decreased with CP-dn-ATF5 alone by about 50% compared with untreated controls; with epoxomicin alone, FLAG-survivin levels rose by about three-fold and this level was not reduced by CP-dn-ATF5 co-treatment. Taken together, these data thus indicate that CP-dn-ATF5 decreases survivin stability and support the idea that enhanced proteasomal turnover contributes to survivin depletion caused by CP-dn-ATF5.Fig. 5Proteasomal turnover and USP9X contribute to the depletion of survivin protein by CP-dn-ATF5.a Proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin suppresses loss of survivin expression promoted by CP-dn-ATF5.

                        "We next explored the mechanism by which CP-dn-ATF5 treatment leads to survivin protein destabilization. The deubiquitinase USP9X has been shown to deubiquinate survivin and thus potentially to inhibit its proteasomal degradation41. Although USP9X downregulation in HeLa cells was reported without effect on survivin protein levels41, similar downregulation of USP9X in SF188 and Panc-1 cells resulted in survivin protein depletion42,43. Our past work has shown that CP-dn-ATF5 dramatically reduces USP9X levels in multiple tumor cell lines including T98G cells27. We therefore asked whether such an effect of CP-dn-ATF5 on USP9X in T98G cells could contribute to the depletion of survivin seen with this agent. Accordingly, we used a previously described USP9X-directed siRNA27 to knockdown USP9X and compared survivin levels with those in cells receiving a control siRNA. This revealed a significant loss of survivin protein (Fig. 5b), but not survivin mRNA (Fig. 5c), thus indicating that the reduction of USP9X caused by CP-dn-ATF5 treatment likely contributes to survivin protein depletion."

                        "Numerous studies have documented that reduction of survivin levels is sufficient to promote death of various tumor cell types30\u201332,34. We confirmed this with an siRNA targeting survivin in T98G, HCT116, MCF7, and MDA-MB-468 cells that induced apoptotic death in each case (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, while direct targeting of survivin expression has been raised as a potential treatment for a variety of cancers, to this point, no successful anti-survivin monotherapy has emerged. In this context, we thus asked whether the capacity of CP-dn-ATF5 to deplete survivin is necessary for its ability to promote tumor cell death or whether this agent also has additional death-promoting activities. To address this, we first over-expressed FLAG-survivin in T98G tumor cells and then assessed the capacity of CP-dn-ATF5 to promote their death. As shown in Fig. 6a, although CP-dn-ATF5 reduced the expression of the FLAG-survivin as anticipated, even under these conditions exogenous survivin was expressed at far higher levels than the corresponding endogenous protein. Despite such high survivin over-expression, it failed to significantly protect T98G cells from death caused by 3 days of CP-dn-ATF5 treatment as indicated by morphology (Fig. 6b), percentage of apoptotic cells as determined by flow analysis (6\u2009C), or cell numbers (6D). We also observed similar results by flow analysis of U87 cells and by cell counts of LN229, GBM12, MDA-MB-231, U251, and DU145 cultures transfected to over-express survivin (Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). Finally, to control for the possibility that CP-dn-ATF5 kills survivin over-expressing tumor cells by a mechanism apart from its dn-ATF5 activity, we also asked whether survivin over-expression would rescue cells transfected with the pLe-GFP-FLAG-dn-ATF5 plasmid. As shown in Fig. 6e, over-expressed survivin also failed to protect from plasmid-delivered dn-ATF5. These findings thus support the conclusion that while CP-dn-ATF5 rapidly depletes cells of survivin, it has additional actions that can promote cell death that cannot be rescued by survivin over-expression.Fig. 6Survivin over-expression is not sufficient to rescue tumor cells from apoptotic death promoted by dn-ATF5.a CP-dn-ATF5 reduces expression of over-expressed FLAG-survivin, but to levels far in excess of endogenous survivin. T98G cultures were infected with lentivirus expressing either pLVX-EF1\u03b1-IRES-mCherry (pLV in Figure) or pLVX-EF1\u03b1-FLAG-survivin-IRES-mCherry (pLV-survivin in Figure) as indicated and 24\u2009h later treated with or without 100\u2009\u00b5M CP-dn-ATF5 for 3 d and assessed for exogenous and endogenous survivin by western immunoblotting with anti-survivin. Long exposure shows levels of endogenous survivin. b Survivin over-expression does not rescue the effects of CP-dn-ATF5 on number or appearance of T98G cells. Cultures were infected with lentiviruses described in panel a as indicated and 24\u2009h later were treated with 100\u2009\u00b5M CP-dn-ATF5 for 3 days. Panels show immunofluoresence for mcherry (red) or phase contrast images. Scale bars\u2009=\u200950\u2009\u00b5m. c Survivin over-expression does not rescue T98G cells from apoptotic death promoted by CP-dn-ATF5. Cultures were infected with lentivirus described in panel a and 24\u2009h later were treated with 100\u2009\u00b5M CP-dn-ATF5 for 3 days. Cultures were harvested and analyzed for proportion of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Left panel shows the representative cytometry data and right panel shows quantitative results from three independent experiments, each in triplicate. d Survivin over-expression does not rescue cell number in T98G cultures treated with CP-dn-ATF5. Cultures were infected with above described lentiviruses and 24\u2009h later were treated with or without 100\u2009\u00b5M CP-dn-ATF5 as indicated for 3 days. Cultures were harvested and analyzed for total cell numbers. Data are from three independent experiments, each in triplicate. e Survivin over-expression does not rescue promotion of apoptosis by FLAG-GFP-dn-ATF5 in multiple cancer cell lines. Indicated cell lines were co-transfected as shown with a ratio of pLVX:pLE constructs of 3:1 and transfected (GFP+) cells were assessed for proportion with apoptotic nuclei 3 days later. Data are from three independent experiments",
                        "The inability of survivin over-expression to rescue tumor cells from the lethal effects of dn-ATF5 exposure raised the question of whether CP-dn-ATF5 might kill tumor cells by a non-apoptotic mechanism. Our past work showed that tumor cell death promoted by transfected dn-ATF5 plasmid is apoptotic in nature and is blocked by inhibition of caspase activity2. We confirmed this for CP-dn-ATF5 in the present study in which the caspase inhibitor zVAD rescued cell numbers and the occurrence of apoptotic nuclei from the effects of 3 days of peptide exposure (Supplementary Fig. 8). Past work has shown that dn-ATF5 expression leads to downregulation of pro-survival BCL29,27,28. We therefore additionally assessed whether BCL2 over-expression would protect T98G cells from 3 days of CP-dn-ATF5 treatment. While Bcl2 over-expression reduced the presence of apoptotic nuclei, such protection from CP-dn-ATF5 was only partial (Supplementary Fig. 9). Taken together, these findings support the idea that dn-ATF5 promotes caspase-dependent apoptotic death of cancer cells and that it does so by multiple pro-apoptotic actions including downregulation of survivin and BCL2. Moreover, owing to the multiplicity of these actions, replacement of a single pro-survival protein such as survivin is insufficient to maintain viability."

                "The present findings establish that dn-ATF5 consistently depletes survivin expression in a wide variety of human tumor cell lines. This appears to occur by both decreases in levels of survivin mRNA and enhanced survivin turnover. These decreases occur rapidly and are durable. Given survivin\u2019s roles in cancer cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance30\u201332,34,35, dn-ATF5-induced survivin depletion is highly likely to contribute to dn-ATF5\u2019s anti-tumor actions.",
                "We observed that both plasmid-encoded and a penetratin-linked synthetic forms of dn-ATF5-promoted survivin depletion. The plasmid-encoded form has N-terminal GFP and FLAG tags followed by a linker region and retains the 25 amino acids C-terminal to the leucine zipper domain of ATF5. These sequences are not present in CP-dn-ATF527, thus indicating that they are neither required for, nor interfere with, the capacity of dn-ATF5 to deplete survivin. Likewise, addition of the N-terminal penetratin domain in the synthetic form does not appear to interfere with its capacity to regulate survivin expression.",
                "It was also conceivable that plasma-encoded and penetratin-linked dn-ATF5 might be present in different subcellular compartments that would result in distinct effects on survivin levels. This did not appear to be the case, indicating that both forms have similar activities. We also evaluated a form of 3xFLAG-dn-ATF5 mutated in the leucine zipper domain. This mutant form failed to deplete survivin, demonstrating that leucine zipper function is indispensable for dn-ATF5\u2019s capacity to affect survivin expression.",
                "One potential issue about the effects of dn-ATF5 on survivin expression was whether this was a response to, rather than contributor to, apoptotic death. Our findings with both transfected and penetratin-linked dn-ATF5 showed depletion of survivin mRNA and protein well before onset of cell death, thus supporting a role for survivin depletion as a primary contributor rather than responder to cell death triggered by dn-ATF5.",
                "Our findings indicate that dn-ATF5 selectively depletes nuclear-localized survivin. It has been reported that survivin turns over more efficiently in nuclei44\u201346. In this light, given that dn-ATF5 rapidly diminishes survivin mRNA levels, loss of nuclear survivin may reflect decreased survivin synthesis that cannot keep up with the level of degradation in this compartment. Additionally, or alternatively, dn-ATF5 may affect survivin movement between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, so that nuclear import is reduced or export is increased. In either case, loss of nuclear localization would suggest that at least one consequence of survivin depletion by dn-ATF5 is defective cell cycle progression.",
                "The mechanisms that underlie the depletion of survivin by dn-ATF5 appear to be complex with both reduction of mRNA levels and post-translational degradation playing roles (Fig. 7). It is presently unknown whether survivin is a direct or indirect transcriptional target of ATF5 or whether dn-ATF5 might act by binding and sequestering another partner that influences survivin mRNA or protein expression. Our findings that dn-ATF5 reduces expression of survivin protein encoded by plasmids with heterologous promoters and that it accelerates turnover of endogenous survivin establish a role for a post-translational mechanism in survivin depletion. Prior work shows that survivin is subject to proteasomal degradation39,40. Consistent with this, we found that the proteasomal inhibitor epoxomicin elevated expression of transfected FLAG-survivin. We also observed that epoxomicin blocked the depletion of FLAG-survivin by CP-dn-ATF5, a finding that supports the idea that one mechanism by which dn-ATF5 reduces survivin is by promoting its proteasomal destruction. Survivin appears to be protected from proteasomal degradation by interaction with partners such as HSP9047 and by deubiquitination by enzymes including USP9X42,43. We previously reported that CP-dn-ATF5 substantially reduces expression of USP9X in a variety of tumor cell lines27. This raised the possibility that enhanced survivin turnover by dn-ATF5 is mediated at least in part by USP9X depletion (Fig. 7) and in support of this, we found that USP9X knockdown in T98G cells results in a significant reduction of survivin protein levels.Fig. 7Proposed role of survivin regulation in the mechanism by which dn-ATF5 kills tumor cells",
                "Among the issues explored here was whether survivin depletion fully accounts for the apoptotic activity of dn-ATF5. The degree of survivin depletion in many cell lines achieved with dn-ATF5 (in some cases, >90%) was on the order reached by survivin si- or sh-RNA treatments that elicit apoptotic tumor cell death. Thus, it appears that the depletion of survivin caused by dn-ATF5 is likely to be sufficient to cause death. On the other hand, our experiments indicated that death of tumor cells promoted by CP-dn-ATF5 was not rescued by survivin over-expression. This suggests that dn-ATF5 triggers pro-apoptotic events in addition to survivin depletion that are sufficient to kill cancer cells. Thus far, additional identified actions of dn-ATF5 that could contribute to its apoptotic actions include depletion of MCL1 and BCL25,10,27,28 (Fig. 7) and it is highly likely that more remain to be identified. The potential capacity of dn-ATF5 therapeutics to deplete survivin as well as other survival-promoting proteins may represent an advantage over drugs such as siRNAs that target only survivin.",
                "In addition to promoting cancer cell death as monotherapies, agents that reduce survivin expression or activity are reported to sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutics or radiation30\u201335. Because dn-ATF5 depletes survivin in tumor cells, this suggests that it may also serve in combination therapies to overcome therapeutic resistance. This possibility is supported by reports that dn-ATF5 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to paclitaxel9 and that ATF5 promotes radioresistance of lung cancer cells11."
