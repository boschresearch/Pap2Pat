Cancer cells cultured on the 3P scaffold formed tight aggregates, termed tumoroids, similar to in vivo tumors that depend on the topography and net charge of the scaffold. 3P scaffolds induced tumor cells to undergo the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as demonstrated by up-regulation of vimentin and loss of E-cadherin expression. The 3P-based tumoroids showed higher resistance to anticancer drugs than the same tumor cells grown as monolayers. Inhibition of ERK and PI3K signal pathways prevented EMT conversion and reduced tumoroid formation, diameter and number.",
                        "Fine needle aspirates, collected from tumors in mice, when cultured on the 3P scaffolds of the disclosure formed tumoroids, but showed an even greater decrease in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, compared to tumoroids formed by direct seeding. Accordingly, the 3P scaffolds provide an excellent platform for producing tumoroids from tumor cell lines and from biopsies and that the platform can be used to culture patient biopsies, test for anticancer compounds, and thereby allow the tailoring of a personalized cancer treatment."

                        "Three dimensional (3D) cultures provide innovative approaches to study processes that contribute to tumorigenesis because they recapitulate cancer cells in their native in vivo environment. The majority of the supporting data that posits the importance of tumorigenesis has been obtained using two dimensional (2D) cell culture systems. Cells in 2D are subjected to unnatural mechanical and geometric constraints that do not represent the three dimensional (3D) milieu of a tumor. The complex interplay between biochemical, and mechanical properties may be undermined or compromised in 2D cultures and may affect many important functions such as gene and protein expression. Considerations on the mechanical, biochemical and physical properties of any 3D system, aim to mimic the native ECM. One of the major advantages is the potential for rapid experimental manipulation achieved by controlling these parameters that can permit development of sophisticated cancer models. Tailored 3D cell culture scaffolds combining relevant platforms with multiple bio-functionalities will allow for the specific induction of signal transduction pathways, the sorting of different cell types, or the control of cancer cell differentiation. Combination of existing 3D systems that impart separate yet important characteristics that preserve structural and functional in vivo-like complexity to the whole will increase the sophistication of these 3D models. Presently, there exist a significant need for more realistic tumor models to study tumorigenesis and the effective screening of anticancer drugs.",
                        "The most commonly used 3D model are spheroids that are used for a variety of experimental studies in chemotherapy and radiotherapy and are being pursued in high throughput screening (HTS) programs for drug development, candidate efficacy and safety. Spheroids impart functional and mass transport properties similar to those observed in micrometastases or poorly vascularized regions in solid tumors (Hirschhaeuser et al., (2010) J. Biotechnol. 148: 3-15). These features combined with the complexities of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, affect the uptake, penetration, distribution and bioactivity of therapeutic drugs. They are simple 3D structures that can be generated from a wide range of cell types, and form due to the tendency of adherent cells to aggregate and are typically created from single or co-culture techniques such as hanging drop, rotating culture or conclave plate methods to name a few (Pampaloni et al., (2007) Nat. Revs. Mol. Cell Biol. 8: 839-845; Timmins et al., Cell Tissue Res. 320: 207-210; Castaneda & Kinne (2000) J. Cancer Res. Clinical Oncol. 126: 305-310).",
                        "The inherent limitation of this model is that it is entirely cell based and do not represent the mechanical features of the ECM as a whole. To address this issue various substrates or scaffolds derived from biological, natural or synthetic sources have been used to form hydrogels, films, fibers, micromolded structures in microfluidic devices, and microchips in the construction of spheroids. For example, hepatocytes self-assemble to form spheroids on scaffolds made from alginate, hyaluronic acid, peptide scaffolds, and galactosylated meshes (Gurski et al., (2009) Biomaterials. 30: 6076; Gurski et al., (2010) Biomaterials. 31: 4248; Elkayam et al., (2006) Tissue Engineering 12: 1357-1368; Shin et al., (2012) Biotech.

                        "Incorporation of spheroids into synthetic 3D polymeric scaffolds has been used as a model for screening anticancer drugs (Ho et al., (2010) Cancer Sci. 101: 2637-2643). These scaffolds provide support for the spheroids thereby mimicking the physical interaction of the tumor with the topographical features of the native ECM, as for example, between the tumor and the basement membrane.",
                        "The interaction of mammalian cells with sub cellular topography has proven to be an important signaling modality in controlling cell function via mechanotransductive cues. The tumor microenvironment consisting of tumor cells and corresponding stroma intimately associate with the physical structures of the ECM during all stages of tumorigenesis. Synthetic substrate topography has been shown to influence cell migration, differentiation, and gene expression. For example, SAL/N cancer fibroblasts cultured on micropatterned PDMS and C6 glioma cells cultured on polystyrene periodic structures exhibit differences in morphology, proliferation and migration in response to various topographical cues (Tzvetkova-Chevolleau et al., (2008) Biomaterials 29: 1541-1551; Wang et al., (2006) J. Biomed. Mats. Res. Part A. 78A: 746-54).",
                        "Electrospinning is a versatile technique used to produce polymeric fibrous scaffolds for cell culture applications. It allows for the preparation of unique matrices of aligned or non-woven meshes containing nano to micrometer sized fibers using diverse materials and fabrication techniques (Zanatta et al., (2012) Brazilian J. Med. Biol. Res. 45: 125-130; Zanatta et al., (2012) J. Biomed. Nanotechnol. 8: 211-218; Yu et al., (2012) Carbohydrate Polymers 90: 1016-1023; Tsai et al., (2012) PloS one. 7: e31200; Sundaramurthi et al., (2012) Biomedical Materials 7: 045005; Samavedi et al., (2012) Biomaterials; Meinel et al., (2012) Eur. J. Pharmaceut. Biopharmaceutics. 81: 1-13). Studies have shown that modified electrospun scaffolds simulate favorable functional responses in cancer cells (Agudelo-Garcia et al., (2011) Neoplasia 13: 831-896; Johnson et al., (2009) Tissue Engineering Part C-Methods 15: 531-540; Xie & Wang (2006) Pharmaceut.

                                "Polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA) ((C3H4O2)n) is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch, tapioca roots, chips or starch, or sugarcane. Polymerization of a racemic mixture of L- and D-lactides usually leads to the synthesis of poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA), which is amorphous. Use of stereospecific catalysts can lead to heterotactic PLA which has been found to show crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, and hence many important properties, is largely controlled by the ratio of D to L enantiomers used, and to a lesser extent on the type of catalyst used. Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid, several distinct forms of polylactide exist: poly-L-lactide (PLLA) is the product resulting from polymerization of L,L-lactide (also known as L-lactide). PLLA has a crystallinity of around 37%, a glass transition temperature between 60-65\u00b0 C., a melting temperature between 173-178\u00b0 C. and a tensile modulus between 2.7-16 Gpa. Accordingly, the 3P and 3PC scaffolds provided herein can comprise a PLA composition having only D-enantiomers, only L-enantiomers or a mixture of D- and L-enantiomers.

Common catalysts used in the preparation of this polymer include tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, tin(II) alkoxides, or aluminum isopropoxide. During polymerization, successive monomeric units (of glycolic or lactic acid) are linked together in PLGA by ester linkages, thus yielding a linear, aliphatic polyester as a product. Depending on the ratio of lactide to glycolide used for the polymerization, different forms of PLGA can be obtained: these are usually identified in regard to the monomers' ratio used (e.g. PLGA 75:25 identifies a copolymer whose composition is 75% lactic acid and 25% glycolic acid). In one embodiment, the PLGA contains approximately 85% lactic acid and 15% glycolic acid.

The examples below demonstrate an analysis of the effect of the 3P scaffold on cell proliferation, spheroid formation and therapeutic drug efficacy. Using different cancer cell lines it was determined that spheroid formation on the scaffold induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) an embryonic program that reemerges during cancer metastasis. Signal transduction of EMT conversion was examined by the use of pathway specific inhibitors and demonstrated that these pathways were involved in spheroid formation and EMT induction on the scaffold. Gene expression analysis elucidated the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the transition and identified key genes associated with this process. The ability of the scaffold to monitor pharmacological efficacy was also analyzed by using known anti-tumor agents as control modulators of EMT to abrogate growth and differentiation of cancer cells. Accordingly, the examples demonstrate that the 3P scaffolds described herein can be utilized as a platform to study processes in tumorigenesis and can be used to evaluate anti-cancer therapies as an intermediate decision-making step in high throughput screening of drugs to treat cancer.",

The scaffolds were fixed in a 50:50 (v/v) solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M cocadalate buffer (pH 7.1) for 24 hours. The scaffolds were washed in buffer then dehydration in 1% osmium tetroxide in cocadylate buffer at 40\u00b0 C. for one hour. The scaffolds were washed in cocadalate buffer then further dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol at concentrations 10%, 35%, 50%, 70%, 95% and 100% for ten minutes. Final dehydration was done in hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) for 10 minutes. Samples were air dried then sputter coated with gold at a density of 19.32/cm3 for 30 seconds under argon gas.

Spheroids transferred to new scaffolds maintained their morphology and shape over the same time period. In addition to topography and chemistry, other cues present in the 2D environment but absent in the 3P scaffold, may play a role in instigating outward migration on the TCP, for example, factors such as substrate density and elasticity, difference in cell polarity and pressure gradients within the spheroids reacting to unnatural constraints exerted by the 2D environment.",

Additionally, spheroids exhibited a loss of E-Cadherin expression on the 3P scaffold, while cells cultured on monolayer and PLGA scaffold retain this expression (FIG. 5B). This suggests that spheroid formation correlates with enhanced invasive potential and tumorgenicity, characteristics that define EMT and that appears to be manifested within the context of the 3P environment. To determine the timeline of EMT induction, LLC cells were cultured on the 3P scaffold and stained for vimentin and E-cadherin from day 1 to day 4 culture.

All anti-tumor agents prevented spheroid formation and proliferation on 3P scaffolds (data not shown). In addition, these compounds were efficient at down regulating vimentin while maintaining E-cadherin expression in cells similar to that observed with cells cultured on PLGA scaffold alone and on the monolayer. To determine if treatment by these agents would deregulate EMT in fully formed spheroids, the same concentration of drugs were administered to LLC spheroids cultured at day 4. A lack of vimentin expression and a concomitant expression of E-cadherin was again observed suggesting EMT inhibition. As expected, untreated spheroids were positive for EMT marker expression.

As mentioned previously, treatment of MCF-7 spheroids with inhibitors abrogated spheroid formation and on the 3P scaffold. The IC-50 of a drug is defined as the median lethal dose of a drug to inhibit biological or biochemical function. Successive viability measurements of treated cells revealed significantly different cytotoxic responses between cells on the 3P scaffold and on monolayer culture. After 48 hours of drug induction, MCF-7 cell viability was significantly lower and indicated a higher sensitivity in 2D monolayer culture than cells cultured on the 3P scaffold.

For example, there appears to be greater fold differences in EMT differentiation and developmental genes, between cells cultured on 3P scaffold versus monolayer and cells cultured on 3P versus PLGA as compared to differences observed in the other groups of genes. Since EMT is a trans-differentiation program, these results support the observation that the 2D monolayer environment exerts less pressure on LLC cells to undergo differentiation while combined cues from the 3P scaffold coupled with the multicellular spheroid facilitate EMT induction.",
                                "EMT involves multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways that form highly interconnected networks. Here the network pathways highlight the expected relationships between differentially expressed genes. The transcriptional repression of key epithelial markers such as E-cadherin (Cdh1), and up regulation of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin (Vim) and fibronectin (Fn1) were observed. EMT is a continuum whereby induction of genes appears to occur 24 hours prior to the expression of related proteins as observed in 48 hours in the timeline experiment described above. Up regulation of the TGF-\u03b2, Notch and WNT genes was observed, which genes drive the three major pathways that control EMT expression and are responsible for activating key mediators such as Stat3, Gsk3b, and transcription factors Twist and Snail. Since there is a network of transcriptional control regulators, other transcription factors such as transcription factors 1 and 4 (TCFl1 and TCF4) and estrogen receptor1 (ESR1) would also be affected. Activation of these pathway genes further regulate the expression of genes that play a role in extracellular matrix and cell adhesion, integrin (Itgav) and metalloprotease (MMP9), and genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling such as keratin (Krt7) and pleckstrin homology (Plek2).",

The IC50 values for 3P cultures were 10-fold higher for Ly294002 inhibitor and 100-fold higher for U0126 inhibitor than for monolayer cultures. These results are similar to other reports by other studies showing that tumor cells grown as 3D tumoroids develop multicellular resistance to most cytotoxic drugs compared to those grown in monolayer culture (Kobayashi et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 3294-3298; Desoize et al., (1998) Bull. Cancer 85: 785). For example, the in vivo drug-resistant variant, EMT-6, of mouse mammary tumor cells lost resistance when cultured as a monolayer but regained it when regrown in vivo as a solid tumor or in vitro as tumoroids (Teicher et al. (1990) Science 247: 1457-1461). The reasons for the differences between 3D and monolayer cultures remain unknown. Pathophysiological gradients to nutrients, oxygen and drugs and the concentric arrangement of heterogeneous cell populations within the 3P tumoroids may affect RNA and protein expression. For example, it has been reported that quiescent cells near the necrotic core of a tumoroid up-regulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, which arrests cells in the G0/G1 phase and induces cell cycle resistance (St Croix et al. (1996) Nat. Med. 2: 1204-1210). The expression of p27Kip1 is fifteen times greater in tumoroid culture than in monolayer culture. In addition, inhibition of apoptosis via the Bcl-2 pathway (Zhang et al., (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 92: 6161-6165) and the down-regulation of PMS2 and topoisomerase 11 DNA mismatch repair proteins (Francia et al., (2004) Mol. Cell Biol. 24: 6837-6849; Olive et al., (1991) Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 60: 453-466) have been proposed as mechanisms that desensitize tumor cells in tumoroids to antitumor agents. It has now been found that this resistance was not a result of a mass transport defect. This is consistent with other drug penetration data that have shown that despite efficient drug penetration, tumoroids still exhibit higher drug resistance than monolayer cultures (Erlanson et al., (1992) Cancer Chemotherapy Pharmacol. 29: 343-353; Ho et al. (2010) Cancer Sci. 101: 2637-2643).

Results with the biopsy-derived tumoroids cultured on the 3P scaffold of the disclosure, however, suggest that co-cultures of tumor cells with stromal cells, as obtained from the biopsied tumors will produce tumoroids that better reflect the in vivo context. These tumor/stroma effects on chemosensitivity underscore the advantage of using a 3D platform such as the 3P scaffold for growth of actual patient tumor biopsies to test the efficacy of anticancer drugs.",
