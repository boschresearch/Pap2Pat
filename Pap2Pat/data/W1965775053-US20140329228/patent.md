# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen, and a method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen, by which a low molecular weight compound can be detected with high sensitivity without the need of immobilization and washing steps.

## BACKGROUND ART

Immunoassays using antibody-antigen binding are broadly employed for the detection of substances in specimens or the measurement of the concentrations thereof. The measurement method most broadly employed for clinical diagnosis, basic research, environmental research, and the like among these methods for measuring the concentrations of antigens and antibodies is a type of immunoassay referred to as a sandwich ELISA method (or sandwich RIA method). This method uses 2 types of monoclonal antibody that recognizes different epitopes of the same antigen, or a monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody. The sandwich method is as specifically described below. The 1st stage involves immobilizing a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody referred to as a primary antibody on a measurement plate, injecting a sample containing an antigen into the plate, and then allowing the plate to stand for a period of time for reaction so as to bind the antibody and the antigen. Next, the 2nd stage involves removing contaminants bound to the antibody and any antigen that has nonspecifically bound to the plate by washing with a washing solution. The 3rd stage involves injecting a solution of a labeled secondary antibody to which a reporter molecule such as an enzyme, a fluorescent dye, or a radioisotope has been bound in advance for a reaction to occur for a period of time, so that the labeled secondary antibody will bind to the antigen captured by the primary antibody. After this reaction, excess labeled antibody is removed by washing with a washing solution, the amount of the reporter molecule bound to the measurement plate is measured with the use of enzyme activity, fluorescence, a radioisotope, or the like, and thus the amount of the antigen in the sample is measured.

As described above, a general sandwich ELISA method requires two types of antibodies; the epitopes for which are different. When, for example, a low molecular weight compound or the like is used as an antigen, it is difficult to prepare a plurality of antibodies that recognize different epitopes. Accordingly, Ueda et al., have established a highly accurate immunoassay for low molecular weight compounds, which is referred to as an open sandwich method. This method uses a light chain variable region (VL) and a heavy chain variable region (VH) of a single antibody (Patent Documents 1 and 2, Non-patent Documents 1 and 2). This method is used to measure the concentration of an antigen and comprises preparing a VH-region polypeptide and a VL-region polypeptide of an antibody that specifically recognizes an antigen, labeling one of the polypeptides with a reporter molecule to prepare a labeled polypeptide, immobilizing the other polypeptide on a solid phase to prepare an immobilized polypeptide, bringing a specimen containing the antigen and the labeled polypeptide into contact with the immobilized polypeptide, and then measuring the amount of the reporter molecule of the labeled polypeptide bound to the immobilized polypeptide. Another example of a method for measuring a low molecular weight compound is a liquid chromatography method, in addition to immunoassays. However, such method is problematic in that it requires a highly accurate measuring instrument, a large amount of a test sample, and much time for measurement, and it has low general versatility.

Moreover, as immunoassays for measuring the concentration of an antigen using an antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye, an immunoassay that involves labeling an antibody and an antigen with different fluorescent dyes, and then using changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency taking place between the fluorescent dyes as indicators (Non-patent Documents 3 and 4), an immunoassay that involves using changes in efficiency due to quenching (and specifically, such method makes use of the phenomenon whereby the fluorescence of an antibody, which has been quenched by mixing a fluoro-labeled antibody in advance with a quenching substance, is increased through the introduction of a substance to be detected), and an immunoassay that involves measuring a decrease in fluorescence intensity resulting from the aggregation of an antibody (fluoro-labeled antibody) labeled with a fluorescent dye and a substance to be measured (Patent Document 3) are known.

However, most immunoassays require a step of immobilizing an antibody or an antigen and a washing step for eliminating the adsorption of a non-specific labeling compound. Since these steps require complicated procedures, are time-consuming, and produce variable measurement results, the development of a liquid phase immunoassay that requires neither an immobilization step nor a washing step is required. Accordingly, the present inventors have developed “homogenous fluorescence immunoassay” (also referred to as a “homogenous fluorescent immunoassay method,” “Quenchbody assay,” or “Q-body assay”) that is a liquid phase system requiring neither an immobilization step nor a washing step, enables the rapid and convenient quantitative measurement of a target substance, and allows visualization of an antigen (Patent Document 4, Non-patent Document 5, FIGS. 1-3).

The above “homogenous fluorescence immunoassay” is a measurement method using technology that utilizes the quenching phenomenon, relating to:

(1) a kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen, which enables the measurement of the concentration of an antigen or the visualization of an antigen, using a positive correlation between the concentration of an antigen and the fluorescence intensity of a fluorescent dye in a liquid phase, as an indicator, wherein the kit is provided with an antibody light chain variable region (referred to as “VL”) polypeptide and an antibody heavy chain variable region (referred to as “VH”) polypeptide, and either the antibody light chain variable region polypeptide or the antibody heavy chain variable region polypeptide is labeled with a fluorescent dye; and

(2) the kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen according to (1), wherein the VL polypeptide and the VH polypeptide are bound to form a single-chain antibody. Specifically, this is a fluorescent immunoassay that comprises: mixing two antibody fragments in which either a VL polypeptide or a VH polypeptide is fluoro-labeled, or a single-chain antibody (scFv) in which a fluoro-labeled VL polypeptide and a VH polypeptide are bound to each other (with (1) and (2) being referred to as “Quenchbody” or “Q-body,” (1) also being referred to as “VH+VL-type Q-body,” and (2) also being referred to as “scFv-type Q-body”) in a test specimen solution to be tested to determine the presence of an antigen; and enabling the measurement of the concentration of an antigen or the visualization of an antigen using a positive correlation between the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye and the concentration of an antigen as an indicator (FIGS. 1-3). The principle of such a measurement method is that highly conservative tryptophan residues within an antibody molecule interact with a fluorescent dye so as to quench the fluorescent dye, and the quenching is canceled in an antigen-dependent manner as a result of the addition of the antigen.

The “homogenous fluorescence immunoassay” technique using the Q-body is advantageous in that: 1) it is an extremely convenient measurement technique that requires no washing step, and complete measurement is possible with only the mixture of a small amount of a sample and the measurement of fluorescence intensity; 2) the quenching effect can be exhibited even when the antibody type is varied because of the use of highly conservative tryptophan residues existing in an antibody for quenching, and the technique has excellent general versatility such that it is broadly applicable to detection of various substances with the use of various antibodies; and 3) it is applicable in principle to a low molecular weight compound, since it requires only a single antigen site (see Patent Document 4, FIG. 1), for example. Moreover, the homogenous fluorescence immunoassay requires no washing step and is a convenient measurement method, and thus a measurement device therefor can be designed in a very compact size such that downsizing to a portable palm-sized device is possible. Therefore, even a general user who has never been professionally trained may be able to perform on-site measurements. Although this fluorescence immunoassay is very useful, as described above, the method is problematic in that the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence of an antigen to that in cases in which the antigen reaches a saturation point is as high as 1:6 and is as low as about 1:1.2. Hence, it has been expected that the dynamic range of measurement results would be extended, so as to increase the sensitivity and further improve the performance of the assay.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

### Problem to be Solved by the Invention

An objective of the present invention is to provide an immunoassay, which: enables rapid and convenient detection and/or quantitative measurement of a target substance in a liquid phase without the need for immobilization and washing steps, and allows visualization of an antigen; and

is a fluorescence immunoassay that exhibits an even wider dynamic range for measurement results and high sensitivity.

### Means for Solving the Problem

A fluoro-labeled single-chain antibody (scFv) that had been quenched in an antigen-free solution and then denatured with guanidine hydrochloride had almost the same fluorescence intensity as that in a case in which the antigen reached a saturation point. Based on this, the present inventors considered that increasing the quenching efficiency in the absence of an antigen would be an effective means for increasing the dynamic range. Thus, the following examination was performed.

Specifically, the present inventors speculated that:

quenching might mainly result from contact of tryptophan residues highly conserved in a VL polypeptide and a VH polypeptide with a fluorescent dye(s) used for labeling; and

such fluorescent dye(s) might be moved out from an antigen-binding pocket as a result of stabilization of the structure of a variable region accompanying antigen binding, thereby canceling the quenching state and increasing fluorescence intensity. It was predicted that a VL polypeptide and a VH polypeptide existing as 2 different types of protein would result in lower contact efficiency between fluorescent dye(s) and tryptophan residues and lower the quenching level because of dissociation and weak interaction between the VL polypeptide and the VH polypeptide. Also, in the case of a single-chain antibody (scFv), the interaction between a VL polypeptide and a VH polypeptide can be increased through linking of the VL polypeptide and the VH polypeptide with an artificial peptide linker to form a single-chain antibody. However, it was thought that this could decrease original antibody functions such as its activity to bind to an antigen and its stability because of the addition of such an artificial peptide linker. The present inventors speculated that a Fab fragment might retain its original antibody functions, if a polypeptide comprising an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody light chain constant domain and a polypeptide comprising an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH) and an antibody heavy chain constant domain form the Fab (Fragment, antigen binding) comprising 1 molecule of a hetero dimer protein wherein such polypeptides are bound via a disulfide bond. The present inventors discovered that when either a VH-containing polypeptide or a VL-containing polypeptide of a Fab fragment was fluoro-labeled, the fluorescent dye was more strongly quenched in the absence of the antigen so as to allow lowering of the background. Moreover, the present inventors discovered that when a VH-containing polypeptide and a VL-containing polypeptide of a Fab fragment were each labeled with fluorescent dyes of the same color, a quenching effect (H-dimer) due to the interaction between dyes was obtained in addition to quenching due to contact between the fluorescent dyes and tryptophan residues, and thus higher detection sensitivity could be obtained. The present inventors discovered that when a VH-containing polypeptide and a VL-containing polypeptide of a Fab fragment were each further labeled with fluorescent dyes of different colors, a quenching effect resulting from the FRET effect was obtained in addition to quenching due to the interaction between fluorescent dyes and tryptophan residues and the quenching effect due to contact between dyes, and thus even higher detection sensitivity could be obtained. Furthermore, the present inventors discovered that when a VH-containing polypeptide and a VL-containing polypeptide of a Fab fragment were labeled with a fluorescent dye and a quencher for quenching the fluorescent dye, respectively, quenching due to the interaction between the fluorescent dye and tryptophan residues and the quenching effect between the fluorescent dye and the quencher, and thus high detection sensitivity, could be obtained.

The present inventors further discovered that when the thermal stability of a conventional fluoro-labeled single-chain antibody (scFv) and the same of the fluoro-labeled Fab complex of the present invention were measured, the fluoro-labeled Fab complex was excellent in terms of heat resistance and preservation such that it was denatured at 73° C., although the fluoro-labeled single-chain antibody (scFv) was denatured at 61° C. The present invention was completed based on these findings (FIG. 4).

The measurement method of the present invention enables detection and/or measurement of the binding of an antigen with a complex (hereinafter, also referred to as the “fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention”) comprising a polypeptide (hereinafter, also referred to as “VL-containing polypeptide”) that contains an antibody light chain variable region and a polypeptide (hereinafter, also referred to as “VH-containing polypeptide”) that contains an antibody heavy chain variable region, wherein either or both polypeptides are labeled with a fluorescent dye(s), with the use of the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye as an indicator. Since the above fluorescent dye(s) is in an effectively quenched state when the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention is not bound to an antigen, the antigen can be detected and/or measured with good sensitivity.

## MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION

The kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention is not particularly limited, as long as it is a kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen, which is characterized in that:

the kit is provided with a complex that comprises a polypeptide (VL-containing polypeptide) containing an antibody light chain variable region and a polypeptide (VH-containing polypeptide) containing an antibody heavy chain variable region, wherein either or both the VL-containing polypeptide and the VH-containing polypeptide are labeled with a fluorescent dye(s); and

the kit enables the measurement of the concentration of an antigen or the visualization of an antigen using a positive correlation between the concentration of the antigen and the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye in a liquid phase, as an indicator. The kit may also be provided with an antigen that can be used as a standard substance, reagents, tools, instruction manuals, and the like that are generally used for this type of immunoassay kit, in addition to contain as a component the above complex comprising a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide, one of or both of which are labeled with a fluorescent dye(s).

The above antigen is not particularly limited, as long as it is an antigen that is specifically recognized by the above VH-containing polypeptide, the above VL-containing polypeptide, or a complex comprising these polypeptides. Examples thereof include a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a lipid, a glycolipid, and a low molecular weight compound, as well as proteins subjected to protein modification such as phosphorylation or methylation. The kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention is excellent in detection sensitivity, and thus is particularly useful for detection of a low molecular weight compound.

In the kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention, either or both a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide that compose a complex may be labeled with a fluorescent dye(s). Specifically, the complex that may be used herein is (i) a complex in which either the VL-containing polypeptide or the VH-containing polypeptide is labeled with a fluorescent dye, (ii) a complex in which these polypeptides are labeled with the same fluorescent dye, (iii) a complex in which these polypeptides are labeled with different types of fluorescent dye, or (iv) a complex in which one of these polypeptides is labeled with a fluorescent dye and the other polypeptide is labeled with a quencher for quenching the fluorescent dye. When added to either a VH-containing polypeptide or a VL-containing polypeptide, a fluorescent dye may be added to any one of these polypeptides, and is preferably added to the one so that high detection sensitivity can be obtained. When two different types of fluorescent dye are added to a VH-containing polypeptide and a VL-containing polypeptide, respectively, the combination of a polypeptide and a fluorescent dye to be added thereto is not limited, and is preferably a combination of a fluorescent dye and a polypeptide by which high detection sensitivity can be obtained. A VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide may be: labeled with a protein comprising an arbitrary amino acid sequence, a peptide tag such as a ProX tag (SEQ ID NO: 1), a FLAG tag, a His tag, an HA tag, or an Ni tag, a linker comprising an arbitrary amino acid sequence, a stable radio isotope, an enzyme, or a fluorescent dye that is a type differing from that of the above fluorescent dye; and may further be subjected to modification such as sugar chain addition, phosphorylation, and methylation, as long as the light emission, detection, and quenching of the above fluorescent dye are not inhibited.

The antibody light chain variable region (VL) is not particularly limited, as long as it contains an amino acid sequence specific to an antibody light chain variable region (VL) encoded by an exon of the V and J regions of an antibody light chain gene. The antibody light chain variable region (VL) may be prepared by adding an arbitrary amino acid sequence to the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus of an amino acid sequence specific to the above antibody light chain variable region, or prepared by deleting, substituting, or inserting 1, 2 or more amino acids, as long as the affinity of the above VL-containing polypeptide or the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention for an antigen is not negatively affected. The affinity for an antigen can be adequately examined by a conventional method such as ELISA or FACS. Moreover, an amino acid sequence specific to the above antibody light chain variable region is preferably an amino acid sequence in which the 35th amino acid (as numbered using the Kabat numbering system) is tryptophan.

The antibody heavy chain variable region (VH) is not particularly limited, as long as it contains an amino acid sequence specific to an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH) encoded by an exon of the V, D, and J regions of an antibody heavy chain gene. The antibody heavy chain variable region (VH) may be prepared by adding an arbitrary amino acid sequence to the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus of an amino acid sequence specific to the above antibody heavy chain variable region, or prepared by deleting, substituting, or inserting 1, 2 or more amino acids, as long as the affinity of the above VH-containing polypeptide or the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention for an antigen is not negatively affected. The affinity for an antigen can be adequately examined by a conventional method such as ELISA or FACS. Moreover, an amino acid sequence specific to the above antibody heavy chain variable region is preferably an amino acid sequence in which the 36th, the 47th, or 103rd amino acid (as numbered using the Kabat numbering system) is tryptophan.

Any VL-containing polypeptide may be used herein as long as it contains an antibody light chain variable region (VL), and it can contain an antibody light chain or a peptide comprising an arbitrary amino acid sequence in an antibody light chain. For example, the VL-containing polypeptide may be prepared by adding an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ) and a hinge portion to an antibody light chain variable region (VL), and is particularly preferably a polypeptide prepared by adding Cκ to VL, for example. A specific example of the above VL-containing polypeptide is preferably a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence prepared by adding SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 27, or SEQ ID NO: 4 to SEQ ID NO: 29. Furthermore, a VL-containing polypeptide capable of recognizing an antigen can be adequately prepared depending on the antigen to be measured.

Any VH-containing polypeptide may be used herein, as long as it contains an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH), and it can contain an antibody heavy chain or a peptide comprising an arbitrary amino acid sequence in the antibody heavy chain. For example, the VH-containing polypeptide may be prepared by adding an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1), and further a hinge portion and an Fc region to an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH), and is particularly preferably a polypeptide prepared by adding CH1 to VH, for example. A specific example of the above VH-containing polypeptide is preferably a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence prepared by adding SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 28, or SEQ ID NO: 6 to SEQ ID NO: 30. Furthermore, a VH-containing polypeptide capable of recognizing an antigen can be adequately prepared depending on the antigen to be measured.

The VL-containing polypeptide and the VH-containing polypeptide preferably form a complex, and are not particularly limited, as long as peptides containing amino acid sequences that form the complex are bound to an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH), respectively. Examples of peptides that form a complex include the above antibody constant domains (e.g., CH1 and Cκ). Moreover, one of the peptides forming a dimer can be added to VL and the other can be added to VH. Furthermore, two types of proteins, which interact with each other to contribute to the formation of such a complex, can also be selected.

The “complex” of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention may be any complex, as long as it contains a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide as components that form the complex. The complex may further contain as components, a peptide, a protein, a lipid, a metal, and other compounds, for example, in addition to the above VL-containing polypeptide and VH-containing polypeptide, as long as the functions of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention are not impaired.

Furthermore, the complex of the present invention may be any structure such that the above polypeptides are combined to be able to function integrally. In this case, the presence or the absence of a chemical bond between the above polypeptides is a matter of no importance. Examples of such a bond include a disulfide bond between the above polypeptides and a bond formed using a cross-linking agent. These (plurality of) bonds may be used in combination in one complex. In particular, a preferable example thereof is a disulfide bond. The complex of the present invention is preferably formed of the above polypeptides located close to each other, or comprises a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide that contain peptides having such functions. An antibody light chain constant domain and an antibody heavy chain constant domain in an antibody molecule interact with each other so that the antibody light chain variable region and the antibody heavy chain variable region are located closer to each other, thereby serving an ancillary role to form a strong antigen-binding pocket. Accordingly, as the complex of the present invention, a fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragment that is composed of two polypeptides, which comprises one variable region and one constant domain of each of a light chain and a heavy chain of an antibody and each of the polypeptides is bound via a disulfide bond, a F(ab′)2 fragment wherein two Fab fragments are disulfide-bonded via a hinge, or a full-length antibody is preferred. In particular, a Fab fragment is most preferred. Such fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention that forms a Fab fragment comprising a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide may also be referred to as “the fluoro-labeled Fab complex of the present invention.” In particular, the fluoro-labeled Fab complex of the present invention in which either a VL-containing polypeptide or a VH-containing polypeptide is fluoro-labeled may also be referred to as “the single-label Fab complex of the present invention.” Furthermore, the fluoro-labeled Fab complex of the present invention in which both a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide are fluoro-labeled may also be referred to as “the same-color double-label Fab complex of the present invention” when the two types of fluorescent dye are the same or referred to as “the different-color double-label Fab complex of the present invention” when the two types of fluorescent dye are different.

In the present invention, a VL-containing polypeptide, a VH-containing polypeptide, a complex containing these polypeptides, its components, and the like can be prepared by known chemical synthesis methods, gene recombination techniques, methods for the denaturation of an antibody molecule using protease, and the like. In particular, they can be preferably prepared by gene recombination techniques by which mass preparation is possible with relatively simple operation. When the above polypeptides are prepared by gene recombination techniques, DNA containing the nucleotide sequence encoding such a polypeptide is introduced into an appropriate expression vector to construct a recombinant vector, and then a target polypeptide can be expressed using an expression system using bacterial, yeast, insect, animal/plant cells, or the like as host cells or a cell-free translation system (FIG. 5). When a target polypeptide is expressed in a cell-free translation system, for example, the target polypeptide can be expressed in a reaction solution prepared by adding nucleotide triphosphate and various amino acids to a cell-free extract of such as Escherichia coli, wheat germ, or rabbit reticulocytes. At this time, a tag such as a ProX tag, a FLAG tag, or a His tag may be added to a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide. These tags can be used for addition of a fluorescent dye, purification of a polypeptide, and the like. The thus obtained VL-containing polypeptide and VH-containing polypeptide can be caused to form a complex in an appropriate solvent during, before, or after labeling with a fluorescent dye. Specifically the polypeptides are bound via a disulfide bond or using a cross-linking agent to form a complex, for example. For example, genes encoding the above VL-containing polypeptide and VH-containing polypeptide are co-expressed in an Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell-free synthesis system, followed by 16 hours of incubation at 4° C. to form a disulfide bond. Thus, a complex can be formed. Moreover, molecular chaperon such as protein disulfide isomerase or proline cis/trans isomerase is added to an E. coli cell-free synthesis (reaction) system, and thus disulfide bonding can be accelerated. Moreover, the above cross-linking agent may be a compound that can cause the cross-linking and binding of polypeptides. Examples thereof include aldehydes (e.g., glutaraldehyde), carbodiimides, and imidoesters. A commercially available cross-linking agent can be adequately obtained and used according to a conventional method. Furthermore, the complex of the present invention can also be prepared by cleaving an antibody with an enzyme or the like. For example, an antibody is treated with papain or pepsin, and thus a Fab fragment or a F(ab′)2 fragment can also be prepared.

In the present invention, a method for labeling a VL-containing polypeptide or a VH-containing polypeptide with a fluorescent dye is not particularly limited. A method for directly labeling using functional groups on both ends or a side chain of the polypeptide or indirectly labeling with a cross-linking agent or the like, a technique for site-specifically labeling while synthesizing polypeptides using a cell-free translation system, or the like can be used herein. As a method for labeling with the use of a cell-free translation system, an amber suppression method (Ellman J et al. (1991) Methods Enzymol. 202: 301-36), a four-base codon method (Hohsaka T., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 118, 9778-9779, 1996), a C-terminal labeling method (JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2000-139468 A), an N-terminal labeling method (U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,722, Olejnik et al. (2005) Methods 36: 252-260), or the like is known. The amber suppression method involves preparing DNA or mRNA by substituting a codon encoding an amino acid at a labeling target site with an amber codon that is one of termination codons, and then synthesizing a protein from the DNA or the mRNA using a cell-free translation system. At this time, suppressor tRNA to which a labeled non-natural amino acid has been bound is added to a reaction solution for protein synthesis, and thus a protein, in which such a labeled amino acid has been introduced into a site subjected to substitution with an amber codon, can be synthesized. The four-base codon method involves extending a codon mainly to a four-base codon, CGGG, preparing DNA or mRNA by substituting a codon encoding an amino acid with CGGG, and then synthesizing a protein from the DNA or the mRNA using a cell-free translation system. At this time, tRNACGGG, to which a labeled non-natural amino acid has been bound, is added to the reaction solution for protein synthesis, so that a protein, in which such a labeled amino acid has been introduced into a site subjected to substitution with the four-base codon can be synthesized. For the different-color double-label of the present invention, co-expression is performed by a combination of the amber suppression method and the four-base codon method using a cell-free translation system, a VH-containing polypeptide and a VL-containing polypeptide are labeled with different fluorescent dyes, and then a complex can be formed. According to the C-terminal labeling method, a cell-free translation system prepared by adding labeled puromycin at an optimum concentration, a protein is translated from DNA or mRNA, and the protein, in which a label has been introduced in a C-terminus specific manner, can be synthesized.

Moreover, a technique that involves site-specifically introducing a fluorescent dye by a gene-recombination technique using Escherichia coli or an animal cell as a host can also be used herein. Azidotyrosine is introduced site-specifically to a polypeptide using Escherichia coli as a host, into which aminoacyl tRNA synthase that recognizes azidotyrosine and suppressor azidotyrosyl-tRNA have been introduced. Then a fluorescent dye can be bound to the thus introduced azide group. Also, azide Z lysine is introduced site-specifically to a polypeptide using animal cells as host cells, into which archaebacteria-derived pyrrolidyl tRNA synthase and suppressor pyrrolidyl-tRNA have been introduced, and thus a fluorescent dye can be bound to the thus introduced azide group.

In the present invention, a fluorescent dye to be used for fluorescent labeling is not particularly limited, as long as it is a fluorescent dye that is quenched in the absence of an antigen under a condition where the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention is formed, when a VH-containing polypeptide and/or a VL-containing polypeptide is labeled, and it emits fluorescence when such a complex and an antigen are bound to cancel the quenching functions. Also, when the same or different types of fluorescent dye are added to a VH-containing polypeptide and a VL-containing polypeptide, a combination is preferably selected so that, in addition to the above quenching, quenching between dyes and quenching resulting from the FRET effect effectively take place in the absence of an antigen. Examples of a fluorescent dye to be used for fluorescent labeling include fluorescent dyes having rhodamine, coumarin, Cy, EvoBlue, oxazine, carbopyronin, naphthalene, biphenyl, anthracene, phenenthrene, pyrene, carbazole, or the like as a backbone, or derivatives of such fluorescent dyes.

In particular, particularly preferable examples thereof include rhodamine-based fluorescent dyes, such as CR110 and TAMRA, and an oxazine-based fluorescent dye such as ATTO 655.

A quencher to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited, as long as it can quench the fluorescence of a fluorescent dye that is used for labeling one of components (a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide) of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention in the absence of an antigen, when added to the other polypeptide, and its quenching function is canceled and fluorescence is emitted when the complex binds to an antigen. Examples of such a quencher include quenching dyes containing NBD: 7-nitrobenzofurazan, DABCYL, BHQ, ATTO, QXL, QSY, Cy, Lowa Black, IRDYE, and the like as backbones and derivatives thereof. Specific examples thereof include NBD, DABCYL, BHQ-1 (trade name), BHQ-2 (trade name), BHQ-3 (trade name), ATTO 540Q (trade name), ATTO 580Q (trade name), ATTO 612Q (trade name), QXL490 (trade name), QXL520 (trade name), QXL570 (trade name), QXL610 (trade name), QXL670 (trade name), QXL680 (trade name), QSY-35 (trade name), QSY-7 (trade name), QSY-9 (trade name), QSY-21 (trade name), Cy5Q (trade name), Cy7Q (trade name), Lowa Black FQ (trade name), Lowa Black RQ (trade name), and IRDYE QC-1 (trade name). Of these examples, NBD is preferred. Also, any combination of a fluorescent dye and a quencher in the complex of the present invention can be adequately selected, as long as the quencher effectively quenches the fluorescent dye in the absence of an antigen, but the emission of the fluorescent dye is not inhibited in the presence of an antigen. An example thereof is a combination of a fluorescent dye TAMRA and NBD.

In the case of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention; that is, a complex comprising a VL-containing polypeptide and a VH-containing polypeptide, either or both the VL-containing polypeptide and the VH-containing polypeptide are labeled with a fluorescent dye(s), the quenching of the fluorescent dye takes place in the absence of an antigen because of interaction between the above fluorescent dye and tryptophan residues conserved in the antibody variable region. In addition to this, in the case of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention, wherein the polypeptides are labeled with fluorescent dyes of the same color, the quenching effect between fluorescent dyes can be obtained. Moreover, in the case of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention, wherein the above polypeptides are labeled with fluorescent dyes of different colors, the quenching effect due to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect can be obtained in addition to the above quenching due to tryptophan residues and quenching between the fluorescent dyes. Furthermore, in the case of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention, wherein the above polypeptides are labeled with a fluorescent dye and a quencher for quenching the fluorescent dye, respectively, the dynamic range can be increased by the quenching effect between the fluorescent dye and the quencher.

The method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention may be a method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen which is characterized by comprising the following steps (a) to (c) in sequence:

(a) bringing a complex into contact with an antigen in a specimen for measurement, wherein the complex comprises a polypeptide containing an antibody light chain variable region and a polypeptide containing an antibody heavy chain variable region, in which either or both the polypeptide containing the antibody light chain variable region and the polypeptide containing the antibody heavy chain variable region are labeled with a fluorescent dye;

(b) detecting the fluorescence of the fluorescent dye, or measuring the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye;

(c) calculating the amount of the antigen contained in a sample or visualizing the antigen using a positive correlation between the concentration of the antigen and the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye as an indicator.

Here, the above complex may be the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention. In particular, examples thereof include the fluoro-labeled Fab complex of the present invention, more preferably the single-label Fab complex of the present invention, the same-color double-label Fab complex of the present invention, and the different-color double-label Fab complex of the present invention. In addition, the method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention can be performed using the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention and the kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention.

When the kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention is used and the method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention is performed, the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention is preferably brought into contact with an antigen in a liquid phase. Accordingly, a sample; that is a specimen to be measured is preferably prepared adequately as a liquid specimen or a specimen containing liquid, or a specimen to be measured, which is immersed in liquid and then subjected to the above step (a) or the method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention. The use of the kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention, the origin of a sample to be subjected to the method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention, and the like are not particularly limited. Pretreatment and the like are adequately performed and thus the above specimen for measurement can be prepared. A liquid sample can be directly subjected to measurement as a specimen for measurement, or can be diluted with buffer, physiological saline, or the like, concentrated, or adequately adjusted to have a pH, a salt concentration, or the like to prepare a specimen for measurement, as long as an antigen is not deteriorated or the measurement and/or the detection of antigen concentration is not inhibited. Examples of such a liquid sample include body fluids that can contain a target antigen to be measured, such as serum, blood plasma, saliva, spinal fluids, and urine, culture supernatants, cell extracts, microbial extracts, and industrial wastewater.

A non-liquid sample such as a solid sample can be directly used as a specimen for measurement. Alternatively, such a solid sample may be adequately treated (e.g., divided, shredded, crushed, ground, prepared into tissue sections, or subjected to removal or extraction of only a specific component of the sample), as long as the antigen is not deteriorated or the measurement and/or detection of the concentration of the antigen is not inhibited, and then dissolved, suspended, or immersed in a liquid such as a buffer or physiological saline, so that the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention can come into contact with the antigen, and then the resultant can be used as a specimen for measurement. In the above tissue section preparation, immobilization treatment can be performed using paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde or the like without deteriorating the antigen. Moreover, blocking treatment can also be performed using BSA (bovine serum albumin), skim milk or the like. Examples of such a solid sample include a nitrocellulose membrane or a PVDF membrane to which ingredients such as tissue, cells, proteins, and sugars (collected in vivo) have been blotted, foods and soil. Moreover, a specimen for measurement may adequately contain an antiseptic, a fungicide, a pH adjuster, a surfactant, an anticoagulant agent, a chelating agent, or the like, as long as it does not deteriorate the antigen and not inhibit the measurement and/or the detection of the concentration of the antigen.

In the present invention, furthermore, body fluids such as blood and spinal fluid, tissue, and the like in vivo can also be used as specimens for measurement. Specifically, the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention is administered to a non-human animal such as an experimental animal, so that the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention can be brought into contact with an antigen in vivo. Such a non-human animal may be any animal other than humans. Examples thereof include vertebrates and particularly, non-human animals such as mammals, fishes, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. In particular, mammals are preferred, and mice, rats, hamsters, monkeys, pigs, and the like are more preferred. Also, the above administration method is not particularly limited, and an administration method can be adequately selected from parenteral local administration methods including intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, embedding, and coating, and oral administration methods. Moreover, another drug and the like may also be administered before, simultaneously with, or after the administration of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention. Through administration of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention to a non-human animal, the position or the transfer of an antigen in vivo, the amount of or changes in the amount of an antigen in vivo can also be observed. For such observation, samples such as body fluids and tissues are collected over time, specimens for measurement are prepared, and thus fluorescence intensity can be measured, localization of fluorescence can be observed, or in vivo fluorescence intensity and changes in in vivo fluorescence intensity, and localization and the transfer of fluorescence can be detected and observed in real time.

Reaction conditions for bringing the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention into contact with an antigen in a specimen for measurement are not particularly limited, as long as they can be generally employed for an antigen-antibody reaction after the addition of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention to a specimen for measurement, followed by incubation thereof. The temperature conditions range from 1° C. to 30° C., and preferably range from 18° C. to 25° C., for example. The reaction time ranges from a second to 180 minutes, and preferably ranges from 1 to 90 minutes, for example. Furthermore, when a reaction is performed in vivo in a non-human animal, incubation is performed after administration for 5 to 180 minutes and preferably for 60 to 120 minutes, for example. If necessary, treatment such as, excision of tissue, blood, cells or the like, or exposition of an observation target site can be adequately performed. In a specimen after incubation, the quenching of the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention that has recognized the antigen is canceled, fluorescence is emitted by irradiation with excitation light. However, the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention that has not yet recognized the antigen remains being quenched, and no fluorescence is emitted even via irradiation with excitation light. Accordingly, a specimen for measurement, to which the above fluoro-labeled complex has been added can be directly subjected to the measurement and/or the detection of the concentration of an antigen without being subjected to a step such as a washing step. This is a significant characteristic of the kit for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention and the method for measuring and/or detecting the concentration of an antigen of the present invention.

A method for detecting fluorescence in a specimen for measurement, which is employed in the present invention, is not particularly limited, as long as fluorescence emitted from a fluorescent dye can be detected, and a specimen for measurement after the above reaction is irradiated with excitation light and then the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent dye can be measured and/or detected. Excitation light to be used for irradiation and the wavelength of fluorescence to be measured and/or detected can be adequately selected depending on the type of a fluorescent dye to be used herein. For example, when CR110 is used as a fluorescent dye, a combination of an excitation light wavelength of 480 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 530 nm can be employed. When TAMRA is used, a combination of an excitation light wavelength of 530 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 580 nm can be employed. When ATTO 655 is used, a combination of an excitation light wavelength of 630 nm and a fluorescence wavelength of 680 nm can be employed. Moreover, when different two types of fluorescent dye are used, a combination of an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength, which enables the measurement of the concentration of an antigen and/or the detection of an antigen can be adequately selected and used. For example, a specimen for measurement caused to react with the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention is irradiated with light with an excitation wavelength suitable for one of fluorescent dyes contained in the above fluoro-labeled complex, so as to obtain a fluorescence emission spectrum. This procedure is performed for both two types of fluorescent dye, so that a combination of an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength optimum for the measurement and/or detection of the concentration of an antigen can be specified. An example of a combination of an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength is a combination of an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength, which is suitable for any one of fluorescent dyes. A more preferable example thereof is a combination of an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength, which is suitable for a fluorescent dye with an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength shorter than the other. In addition fluorescence may be detected as a fluorescence emission spectrum or fluorescence intensity at a specific wavelength. For example, when a combination of CR110 and TAMRA is used, fluorescence with a wavelength of 530 nm can be detected with an excitation light wavelength of 480 nm, and fluorescence can also be detected as a fluorescence emission spectrum with a wavelength ranging from 515 nm to 650 nm. With the use of a combination of an excitation light wavelength and a fluorescence wavelength, which is suitable for one of different two types of fluorescent dye, a reduction in the background resulting from the FRET (Fluorescence resonance energy transfer) effect in the absence of an antigen can be efficiently detected and measured with higher sensitivity.

A light source and a measuring device to be used for fluorescence detection in the present invention can be adequately selected. A light source may be any light source by which radiation with an excitation light wavelength is possible, and examples thereof include a mercury lamp, a xenon lamp, LED, and a laser beam. Excitation light with a specific wavelength can be obtained using an appropriate filter. A device to be generally used for fluorescence observation can be used as a fluorescence measuring device. A microscope and the like provided with an excitation light source, an irradiation system thereof, and a fluorescence image acquisition system can be adequately used, for example. Examples thereof include MF20/FluoroPoint-Light (Olympus Corporation) and FMBIO-III (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd.). Fluorescence intensity and the concentration of an antigen are in a positive correlation. Hence, fluorescence intensity is measured when a substance to be tested containing an antigen with a known concentration is used, a standard curve showing the relationship between the concentration of the antigen and the fluorescence intensity is created, and then the concentration of an antigen (with an unknown concentration) can be calculated from the standard curve. Regarding such calculation of the concentration of an antigen, the amount of an antigen can be automatically calculated using the conversion equation or the like determined based on the standard curve created in advance. In addition, the detection of fluorescence may be the detection of a fluorescence emission spectrum or the detection of fluorescence intensity at a specific wavelength.

Furthermore, when the fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention is administered to a non-human animal, a region to be detected of the non-human animal is irradiated with excitation light, and thus the fluorescence of a fluorescent dye can be measured and/or detected two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally, in addition to the collection of a body fluid, tissue, or the like thereof. In this case, a fluorescence microscope, a fluorescent image analyzer, an endoscope provided with a light source, and the like, can be used, for example. Moreover, when detection is performed, images showing the body, tissue, or cell structures of a non-human animal are also preferably obtained using an endoscope, X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasonic wave, microscope, or the like. Measured and/or detected fluorescence intensities and the amounts of an antigen are in a positive correlation. Hence, based on the thus detected two-dimensional or 3-dimensional fluorescence images, the localization (position) and/or the amount of the antigen can be found, and the results can also be compared with the images showing the above structures, at this time. When fluorescence is detected, a specimen for measurement or the like containing no fluoro-labeled complex of the present invention or no analyte is preferably prepared as a negative control, and also preferably subjected to measurement and/or detection. Moreover, the amount of an antigen can also be measured using a fluorescence intensity ratio found by dividing a fluorescence level measured for a specimen for measurement by a fluorescence level measured for the negative control, for example. Alternatively, fluorescence intensities and the amounts of an antigen are in a positive correlation in the present invention, and thus when fluorescence intensity exceeding an adequately determined threshold is obtained, the presence of the antigen in a specimen for measurement can also be determined.

As described above, according to the present invention, all antigens that can be measured by immunoassays such as ELISA, immunodiffusion, latex agglutination, immunochromatography, a surface plasmon resonance method, and the like can be detected. For example, competitive ELISA is generally employed for performing an immunoassay of a low-molecular-weight substance. The method for detection and measurement of a low-molecular-weight substance according to the present invention is better than competitive ELISA in terms of convenient techniques, detection/measurement sensitivity, SN ratio, and the like, and is capable of exhibiting its best capacity. Examples of such low-molecular-weight substances that can be measured and/or detected by the method of the invention include: stimulant drugs and narcotics such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, heroin, and codeine; mycotoxins such as aflatoxin, sterigmatocystin, neosolaniol, nivalenol, fumonisin, ochratoxin, and endophyte-producing toxin; sex hormones such as testosterone and estradiol; additives that are illegally used for feedstuffs, such as clenbuterol and ractopamine; hazardous substances such as PCB, gossypol, histamine, benzpyrene, melamine, acrylamide, and dioxin; residual agricultural chemicals, such as acetamiprid, imidacloprid, chlorfenapyr, malathion, carbaryl, clothianidin, triflumizol, chlorothalonil, spinosad, methomyl (lannate), methamidophos, and clorpyrifos; and environmental hormones such as bisphenol A.

Furthermore, according to the present invention, measurement results can be instantly obtained and the detection method thereof is so simple that detection instruments can be downsized resulting in its lower price. These advantages can be exhibited not only for detection and/or measurement of low-molecular-weight substances, but also for on-site analyses by which measurement is performed on site. Furthermore, measurement is so easy according to the present invention, and thus not only a specialist but also a non-specialist can perform measurement. The method of the present invention can exhibit its ability thoroughly in the fields of: clinical diagnosis, specifically for detection and/or measurement of causative viruses and bacteria of influenza, communicable diseases, infectious diseases, and the like, blood drug levels, and POCT; simple medical examinations at workplaces, schools, day-care centers and home; security and safety, such as antiterrorism measures, specifically for detection and/or measurement of anthrax bacillus, botulinus toxin, sarin, and VX gas; environment, specifically for detection and/or measurement of environmental pollutants and house dust that should be detected and/or measured on site; and research and development requiring immunoassay, for example.

Hereafter, the present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the examples, although the technical scope of the present invention is not limited to the examples.

### Example 2

**2. Measurement by Homogenous Fluorescence Immunoassay Using the Fluoro-Labeled Complex of the Present Invention**

**(Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Measurement Using Single-Label Fab Complex)**

The TAMRA single-label anti-BGP antibody Fab complex, the TAMRA-labeled anti-BGP antibody scFv, or the TAMRA-labeled anti-BGP antibody VH+anti-BGP antibody VL prepared in Example 1, comprising a polypeptide containing an anti-BGP (human osteocalcin) antibody light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 5) and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4), and a polypeptide containing a TAMRA fluorescence-labeled anti-BGP antibody heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 3) and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6) was used to measure the concentration of BGP. The TAMRA single-label anti-BGP antibody Fab complex, or the TAMRA-labeled anti-BGP scFv (70 nM, 6.25 μL), or the TAMRA-labeled anti-BGP antibody VH+anti-BGP antibody VL (70 nM/mL, 6.25 μL) and antigenic BGP-C7 (SEQ ID NO: 13) (0, 1, 3, 10, 25, 100, or 1,000 nM) were prepared to a total of 50 μL using PBS containing 1% BSA (+0.05% Tween20). The solution was left to stand at 25° C. for 70 minutes, and then subjected to fluorescence emission spectrum measurement using a spectrophotofluorometer (FluoroMax-4; HORIBA Jobin Yvon). A He—Ne laser was used at 543 nm, with the excitation wavelength set at 530 nm, and the fluorescence intensity at 580 nm was measured. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each antigen concentration to the fluorescence intensity when no antigen was present is shown in the upper left graph of FIG. 6. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity when the concentration of BGP-C7 was 1,000 nM is shown in the lower left table of FIG. 6. Similarly, the TAMRA single-label anti-bisphenol A Fab complex, or the TAMRA-labeled anti-bisphenol A antibody scFv, comprising a polypeptide containing a TAMRA fluorescence-labeled anti-bisphenol A antibody VL (SEQ ID NO: 7) and Cκ (SEQ ID NO: 4) and a polypeptide containing an anti-bisphenol A antibody VH (SEQ ID NO: 9) and CH1 (SEQ ID NO: 6) was reacted with bisphenol A (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, or 1,000 nM), and then fluorescence intensity was measured. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each antigen concentration to the fluorescence intensity when no antigen was present is shown in the upper right graph of FIG. 6. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity when the concentration of bisphenol A was 1,000 nM is shown in the lower right table of FIG. 6. It was confirmed that the single-label Fab complex of the present invention makes it possible to obtain a fluorescence intensity ratio higher than that obtained using conventional scFv-type Q-body or VH+VL-type Q-body, regardless of the type of fluorescent dye or antigen concentration, and to detect and quantify a low-molecular-weight compound and a protein with high sensitivity. The Fab complex of the present invention forms a complex wherein its components; that is, polypeptides, are located close to each other, compared with those in the scFv-type Q-body or the VH+VL-type Q-body, so that the quenching effect of tryptophan in an antibody variable region on a fluorescent dye takes place effectively.

### Example 3

**Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Measurement Using Same-Color Double-Label Fab Complex**

The same-color double-label Fab complex (70 nM, 6.25 μl) prepared in Example 1, comprising a polypeptide containing a light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 5) of an anti-BGP antibody labeled with CR110, TAMRA, or ATTO 655 fluorescent dye and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4) and a polypeptide containing a heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 3) of an anti-BGP antibody labeled with the same dye and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6) and antigenic BGP-C7 (0 to 10,000 nM) were prepared to a total of 50 μL with PBS containing 1% BSA (+0.05% Tween20). As a control, a single-label Fab complex sample wherein either a polypeptide containing anti-BGP antibody VL (SEQ ID NO: 5) and Cκ (SEQ ID NO: 4) or a polypeptide containing anti-BGP antibody VH (SEQ ID NO: 3) and CH1 (SEQ ID NO: 6) had been fluoro-labeled was prepared. These solutions were left to stand at 25° C. for 70 minutes, and then the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured using a spectrophotofluorometer (FluoroMax-4; HORIBA Jobin Yvon). When the same-color double-label Fab complex labeled with a CR110 fluorescent dye was used, the excitation wavelength (Ex) was set at 480 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength (Em) of 530 nm. When the same-color double-label Fab complex labeled with a TAMRA fluorescent dye was used, the excitation wavelength was set at 530 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength of 580 nm. When the same-color double-label Fab complex labeled with an ATTO 655 fluorescent dye was used, the excitation wavelength was set at 630 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength of 680 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each antigen concentration to the fluorescence intensity when no antigen was present was designated as “fluorescence intensity ratio” and is shown in the graphs of FIG. 7. Fluorescence intensity ratios when the concentration of BGP-C7 was 1,000 nm or 10,000 nm are shown in the tables of FIG. 7.

In a similar manner, the same-color double-label Fab complex comprising a polypeptide containing an anti-serum albumin (SA) antibody light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 10) and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4) and a polypeptide containing a heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 12) of an anti-SA antibody labeled with the same dye and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6) was reacted with antigenic HSA (0 to 100 μM), and then fluorescence intensity was measured. Fluorescence intensity ratios are shown in the graphs of FIG. 8 and fluorescence intensity ratios when the concentration of HSA was 100 μM are shown in the tables of FIG. 8. Based on the above results, it was confirmed that the same-color double-label Fab complex of the present invention makes it possible to measure the amount of an antigen with a fluorescence intensity ratio higher than that of the single-label Fab complex, regardless of the type of fluorescent dye and the type of antigen used. The same-color double-label Fab complex can reduce the background so as to enhance the dynamic range because of the quenching effect (H-dimer) due to the interaction between fluorescent dyes, in addition to the quenching effect of tryptophan in an antibody variable region on a fluorescent dye(s).

### Example 4

**Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Measurement Using Different-Color Double-Label Fab Complex**

The different-color double-label Fab complex (70 nM, 6.25 μL) of an anti-BGP antibody prepared in Example 1, comprising a polypeptide containing a light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 5) of an anti-BGP antibody labeled with CR110, TAMRA, or ATTO 655 fluorescent dye and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4) and a polypeptide containing a heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 3) of an anti-BGP antibody labeled with a dye differing from the above dye and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6) and antigenic BGP-C7 (0 to 1,000 nM) were prepared to a total of 50 μL using PBS (+0.05% Tween20) containing 1% BSA. As a control, a same-color double-label Fab complex sample was prepared. Fluorescence intensity was assumed in a manner similar to Example 3. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each antigen concentration to the fluorescence intensity when no antigen was present was obtained. In addition, when CR110 and TAMRA were used, the excitation wavelength was set at 480 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength of 530 nm (the left graph of FIG. 9). When CR110, TAMRA, and ATTO 655 were used, the excitation wavelength was set at 530 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength of 580 nm (the center graph of FIG. 9). When TAMRA and ATTO 655 were used, the excitation wavelength was set at 630 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength of 680 nm (the right graph of FIG. 9). Fluorescence intensity ratios when the concentration of BGP-C7 was 1,000 nM are shown in each table of FIG. 9.

Similarly, the different-color double-label Fab complex of the anti-SA antibody prepared in Example 1 comprising a polypeptide containing a heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 12) of an anti-SA antibody labeled with a CR110, TAMRA, or ATTO 655 fluorescent dye and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6), and a polypeptide containing a light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 10) of an anti-SA antibody labeled with a dye differing from the above dye and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4) was reacted with antigenic HSA (0 to 100 μM), and then fluorescence intensity was measured. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each antigen concentration to the fluorescence intensity when no antigen was present was designated as the “fluorescence intensity ratio” and is shown in the graphs of FIG. 10. Fluorescence intensity ratios when the concentration of HSA was 100 μM are shown in the tables of FIG. 10.

Furthermore, the different-color double-label Fab complex (also denoted as CR110_TAMRA) of an anti-SA antibody, comprising a polypeptide containing a CR110-labeled anti-SA antibody heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 12) and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6) and a polypeptide containing a TAMRA-labeled anti-SA antibody light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 10) and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4) was reacted with antigenic HSA (1×10−4, 1×10−5, 1×10−6, 1×10−7M). The resultant was irradiated with excitation light having a wavelength of 480 nm (the upper left graph of FIG. 11) or a wavelength of 530 nm (the upper right graph of FIG. 11), and then the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured. Moreover, the CR110 single-label Fab complex (CR110_no) of an anti-SA antibody, comprising a polypeptide containing CR110-labeled anti-SA antibody VH (SEQ ID NO: 12) and CH1 (SEQ ID NO: 6) and a polypeptide containing anti-SA antibody VL (SEQ ID NO: 10) and Cκ (SEQ ID NO: 4) was reacted with antigenic HSA (1×10−4, 1×10−5, 1×10−6, 1×10−7M). The resultant was irradiated with an excitation light having a wavelength of 480 nm, and then the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured (the lower left graph of FIG. 11). The TAMRA single-label Fab complex (no_TAMRA) of an SA antibody comprising a polypeptide containing anti-SA antibody VH (SEQ ID NO: 12) and CH1 (SEQ ID NO: 6) and a polypeptide containing TAMRA-labeled anti-SA antibody VL (SEQ ID NO: 10) and Cκ (SEQ ID NO: 4) was reacted with antigenic HSA (1×10−4, 1×10−5, 1×10−6, 1×10−7M). The resultants were irradiated with excitation light with a wavelength of 530 nm and then the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured using a spectrophotofluorometer (FluoroMax-4) (the lower right graph of FIG. 11). The curves in each graph are of data obtained from samples with HSA concentrations of (from the top) 1×10−4 M, 1×10−5 M, 1×10−6 M, 1×10−7 M, and 0 M.

The above results revealed that in the case of the different-color double-label Fab complex CR110_TAMRA, fluorescence at a wavelength of about 530 nm in the absence of an antigen was suppressed by the FRET effect, when irradiated with excitation light with a wavelength of 480 nm, and thus a high fluorescence intensity ratio was obtained at a wavelength of about 530 nm. Moreover, when irradiated with excitation light with a wavelength of 530 nm, fluorescence intensity ratios obtained at a fluorescence wavelength of about 530 nm in the case of CR110_TAMRA was higher than those of no_TAMRA, because of the quenching effect due to the interaction between the fluorescent dyes. Therefore, the background can be reduced by the addition of the quenching effect due to the interaction between fluorescent dyes and the FRET effect, in addition to the quenching effect of tryptophan in an antibody variable region on a fluorescent dye(s), thereby enhancing the dynamic range. In this experimental system, CR110_TAMRA was capable of detecting an antigen, while exhibiting a maximum of 75-fold fluorescence enhancement, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the present invention.

### Example 5

**Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Measurement Using Fab Complex Comprising Fluoro-Labeled Polypeptide and Quencher-Labeled Polypeptide**

The Fab complex (70 nM, 6.25 μL) prepared in Example 1, consisting of a polypeptide containing a TAMRA-labeled anti-BGP antibody heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 3) and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6), and a polypeptide containing a NBD-labeled anti-BGP antibody light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 5) and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4), and antigenic BGP-C7 (0 to 10,000 nM) were prepared to a total of 50 μL with PBS (+0.05% Tween20) containing 1% BSA. The solution was left to stand at 25° C. for 70 minutes, and then the fluorescence emission spectrum was measured using a spectrophotofluorometer (FluoroMax-4; HORIBA Jobin Yvon). The excitation wavelength was set at 530 nm, and then the fluorescence intensity was measured at a fluorescence wavelength of 580 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at each antigen concentration to the fluorescence intensity when no antigen was present was designated as “fluorescence intensity ratio” and shown in the graph of FIG. 12. The fluorescence intensity ratio when the concentration of BGP-C7 was 1,000 nM is shown in the table of FIG. 12.

The usefulness of the present invention was demonstrated by the results that the Fab complex TAMRA_NBD was capable of detecting BGP at a concentration of 1 nM, the same as that in the case of the single-label Fab complex (TAMRA_No) (FIG. 7), and detecting an antigen, while exhibiting a 27-fold fluorescence enhancement, which was higher than that of the double-label (TAMRA_TAMRA) (FIG. 7).

### Example 6

**Measurement of Thermostability**

A thermal shift assay was performed to measure the thermal stability of the anti-BGP_TAMRA single-label Fab complex and the anti-BGP_TAMRA-labeled scFv prepared in Example 1. The temperature was increased by 1° C. per minute using a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and then fluorescence intensity was measured at each temperature. Thermal stability was measured based on the principle that a quenching state is canceled when each antibody undergoes thermal denaturation to result in the disintegration of the structure, so that fluorescence intensity increases. As shown in FIG. 13, the Tm value (at which thermal denaturation takes place) for the TAMRA-labeled scFv was 61° C., however, the Tm value for the TAMRA single-label Fab complex of the present invention was 73° C.; an increase of 12° C. This thermal stability enables the long-term storage of reagents and can significantly contribute to industrial merits such as distribution temperature, storage temperature, and storage period.

Similarly, a same-color double-label Fab complex comprising a polypeptide containing an anti-ketamine antibody TAMRA-labeled light chain variable region (VL; SEQ ID NO: 31) and an antibody light chain constant domain (Cκ; SEQ ID NO: 4) and a polypeptide containing a TAMRA-labeled anti-ketamine antibody heavy chain variable region (VH; SEQ ID NO: 32) and an antibody heavy chain constant domain (CH1; SEQ ID NO: 6) was synthesized. Subsequently, each complex was reacted with antigenic THC (100 μg/mL) or ketamine (1.0 mg/mL), and fluorescence intensity was measured following the method of Example 4. As shown in Table 5, measurement was successfully performed with fluorescence intensity ratios (indicating fluorescence enhancement) of 1.3 and 2.0.
