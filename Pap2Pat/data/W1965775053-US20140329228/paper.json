    "title": "Ultra Q-bodies: quench-based antibody probes that utilize dye-dye interactions with enhanced antigen-dependent fluorescence",
    "date": "2014-04-11",
    "abstract": "Recently, we described a novel reagentless fluorescent biosensor strategy named Quenchbody, which functions via the antigen-dependent removal of the quenching effect on a fluorophore that is attached to a single-chain antibody variable region. To explore the practical utility of Quenchbodies, we prepared antibody Fab fragments that were fluorolabeled at either one or two of the N-terminal regions, using a cell-free translation-mediated position-specific protein labeling system. Unexpectedly, the Fab fragment labeled at the heavy chain N-terminal region demonstrated a deeper quenching and antigen-dependent release compared to that observed using scFv. Moreover, when the Fab was fluorolabeled at the two N-termini with either the same dye or with two different dyes, an improved response due to enhanced quenching via dye-dye interactions was observed. On the basis of this approach, several targets, including peptides, proteins and haptens, as well as narcotics, were quantified with a higher response up to 50-fold. In addition, differentiation of osteosarcoma to osteoblasts was successfully imaged using a similarly fluorolabeled recombinant Fab protein prepared from E. coli . Due to its versatility, this \u201cUltra-Quenchbody\u201d is expected to exhibit a range of applications from in vitro diagnostics to the live imaging of various targets in situ .",

                        "Because Fab fragments are considered more thermostable compared to the single chain variable region (scFv), which had been successfully converted to a Q-body, we tried to synthesize Q-bodies based on Fab fragments. As a model antibody, we selected anti-human osteocalcin (bone gla protein, BGP) KTM219 as the recognition unit for the bone-related disease marker7. TAMRA was the dye used to conjugate with the Fab as previously described.",
                        "To synthesize Fab-type Q-bodies, we employed two plasmids encoding either VH-CH1 (Fd chain) or CL-C\u03ba (L chain) cDNAs, and incorporated TAMRA into the N-terminal ProX tag region of the Fd during cell-free co-transcription-translation. In addition, Flag- and His-tags were fused at the C-terminus of the Fd and L chains, respectively, to enable their detection and tandem purification (Fig. 1a). After running the translated products on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, the synthesized anti-BGP Fab protein was detected using gel fluorescence imaging (Fig. 1b). A clear fluorescent band reflecting TAMRA fluorescence was observed at the expected molecular weight (26\u2005kDa) of the Fd chain in the reduced sample, and the heterodimeric Fab (Fd/L) was observed at 53\u2005kDa in the non-reduced, denatured sample. This result indicated that a heterodimeric Fab fragment incorporated with TAMRA at the N-terminal region of Fd was successfully generated. The Fab was also detected using Western blotting analyses with anti-Flag and anti-His antibodies. Heterodimeric Fab was observed in the presence of TAMRA-C6-AF-tRNA, although a negligible amount of protein was observed in the absence of suppressor tRNA (Fig. 1c). Taken together, these results indicated that TAMRA-C6-AF-tRNA specifically decoded the amber codon. Furthermore, the anti-BGP Fab was site-specifically and quantitatively labeled with TAMRA."

                        "The labeled Fab was purified using tandem affinity purification with anti-Flag and Ni-NTA resins. Its fluorescence spectra were measured in the presence of various concentrations of antigen BGP-C7 peptide (NH2-RRFYGPV-COOH) (Fig. 2, a\u2013c), resulting in a remarkable dose-dependent increase (9.6-fold) in the intensity of the fluorescence spectra upon the addition of BGP-C7. This increase exceeded that of the scFv Q-body (5.6-fold). To investigate the reason of increased response, the effect of denaturant 7\u2005M guanidium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) added with 100\u2005mM DTT was investigated. Indeed, the labeled Fab showed higher fluorescence enhancement (9.5-fold) than the scFv (5.5-fold), indicating deeper quenching of Fab Q-body in the absence of antigen. A standard curve of the fluorescence intensity at 580\u2005nm suggested that the fluorescence increased in the BGP-C7 peptide concentration occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2b). Using curve fitting, the EC50 value of 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M was obtained, which was lower compared to scFv (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M). Both the deeper quenching and lower EC50 most likely reflected the enhanced stability of the Fab fragment, while maintaining similarly efficient antigen-dependent de-quenching property."

To compare the thermostability properties of the scFv- and Fab-type Q-bodies, a fluorescence-based thermal shift assay was performed using a real-time thermal cycler8. Instead of using an external environmentally sensitive dye, we took advantage of the temperature-dependent denaturation and de-quenching (fluorescence recovery) properties of Q-bodies, as previously demonstrated in its urea-induced denaturation. As a result, melting temperature (Tm) values of 73\u00b0C and 61\u00b0C were obtained for the Fab- and scFv-type Q-bodies, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). The observed higher thermostability of Fab-type Q-body was most likely due to the tighter association of CH1 and CL, which are connected by a C-terminal disulfide bond."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Unlike the scFv fragment, the Fab fragment has two N-termini, each at the Fd and L chains, respectively. To investigate whether a higher fluorescent response can be attained with dye-dye quenching, an expression construct was generated in which an additional amber codon was incorporated into the ProX tag region of the L chain, to attach two TAMRA molecules per Fab. The obtained doubly TAMRA-labeled Q-body, shown as H-TAMRA/L-TAMRA (HTLT), demonstrated antigen-dependent fluorescence intensity increases with a maximum of 25-fold under the same conditions, suggesting deeper fluorescence quenching in the absence of antigen (Fig. 2, d\u2013f). However, the detection sensitivity of this Q-body was very modest with an EC50 of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124\u2005M, which is a value that well exceeded that of single TAMRA-labeled Q-bodies. Indeed, the sensitivities of the H-TAMRA/L-nonlabel (HTLn) and H-nonlabel/L-TAMRA (HnLT) were both higher with an EC50 of 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M and 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22129\u2005M, respectively. Thus, we postulated that the strong interaction, known as H-dimer formation9, between the two TAMRA dyes competes with the antigen binding and subsequent closure of the VH/VL interface, thereby resulting in markedly reduced sensitivity. As fluorescent dyes that are potentially more resistant to H-dimer formation, we attempted to incorporate two other fluorescent dyes, rhodamine 110 (R110) and ATTO655. We found that the fluorescence spectra of double R110- and ATTO655-labeled Fab Q-bodies, namely, H-R110/L-R110 (HRLR) and H-ATTO655/L-ATTO655 (HALA), demonstrated enhanced BGP-C7 dose-dependent fluorescence increases (Supplementary Fig. S2). The maximal fluorescence responses of the HRLR and HALA Q-bodies were 2.4- and 11-fold, respectively, which were greater than that of single dye-labeled Fab Q-bodies and the corresponding scFv Q-bodies (Table 1). Responses of the HRLR and HALA Q-bodies were observed with an estimated EC50 of 7.6 \u00d7 10\u22129\u2005M and 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M, respectively, which were closer to that of single dye-labeled Fab proteins. The lower EC50 values than TAMRA double-labeled Fab probably reflected their lower dimerization/self-quenching behaviors.",
                        "Taken together, these results suggested that the doubly labeled Fab Q-bodies, in which the same dye was incorporated to both the H and L chains, resulted in deeper quenching and a greater antigen-dependent release, due to H-dimer formation and Trp-mediated PET. Because the performances of these Fab Q-bodies far exceeded those of conventional Q-bodies, these position-specific fluorolabeled Fabs were named \u201cUltra-Quenchbodies (UQ-bodies)\u201d."

As a result, a hetero double-labeled maltose binding protein can be successfully used to monitor changes in FRET that are dependent on a conformational change that occurs upon the binding of the substrate maltose.",
                        "As an extension of this approach, we incorporated two different dyes into one Fab molecule to further improve the FRET response between the dyes. To achieve this, we generated another pair of expression constructs in which the amber codon at the N-terminal ProX tag region was replaced with a CGGG codon, to incorporate two different fluorophores into a Fab during the translation reaction (Fig. 3a). We found that the fluorescence spectra of the FRET pair-labeled Q-bodies with the combination of TAMRA as a donor and ATTO655 as an acceptor produced high antigen responses (Fig. 3, b\u2013d, Table 2). The maximum fluorescence responses of the HTLA and HALT Q-bodies at the donor emission wavelength (580\u2005nm) were 50- and 35-fold, respectively, and maintained a high sensitivity. Since these values well exceed the Trp-mediated quenching of TAMRA measured by denaturation (9.5-fold), additional quenching by FRET is a plausible mechanism of the obtained high responses.",
                        "In addition, H-R110/L-TAMRA (HRLT) and H-TAMRA/L-R110 (HTLR) Q-bodies showed that the fluorescence derived from TAMRA increased in a dose-dependent manner upon the addition of BGP-C7 with an excitation of 480\u2005nm. The maximum fluorescence responses of the HRLT and HTLR Q-bodies were 19- and 2.5-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3, Table 2). Probably, these values reflect the product of Trp- and FRET-mediated quenching of these dyes. After curve fitting, the EC50 values were 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127\u2005M and 9.7 \u00d7 10\u22129\u2005M, respectively. In addition, fluorescence intensity ratios of 530\u2005nm and 580\u2005nm increased from 1.2 to 2.8, depending on the BGP-C7 concentration, with an EC50 value of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M."

To resolve this issue, we prepared UQ-bodies using a combination of E. coli expression and thiol-based fluorescence labeling techniques (post-labeling method). To express the anti-BGP Fab fragment with one or two Cys-containing ProX tag(s) at the N-terminal region, bicistronic expression vectors encoding the tagged Fd and L chains were produced. To obtain soluble disulfide-bonded Ig domains in the E. coli cytoplasm, E. coli Shuffle (DE3) cells with an oxidized cytoplasm were transformed with the vector, and the cytoplasmic fraction was recovered after culture. After IMAC, mild reduction and fluorescence labeling were performed, followed by anti-Flag affinity purification, and sufficient amounts of UQ-bodies with high purity were obtained (Fig. 5a). In addition to TAMRA-C5-Maleimide, a shorter wavelength derivative ATTO520-C2-Maleimide was used for labeling, which exhibited less propensity for H-dimer formation. First, the antigen-binding activity of the double-labeled UQ-bodies was confirmed using ELISA with immobilized antigen (Supplementary Fig. S5a). We found that both TAMRA and ATTO520 double-labeled UQ-bodies showed high antigen-binding activity with similar Fab dose-dependency. In addition, each chain of the UQ-bodies showed sufficient purity and fluorescence, as assessed using SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S5b). It is worth noting that in the cases of single-labeled UQ-body, only a fluorescent band for heavy chain (Fd chain) was observed, ruling out the possibility of off-target labeling of intradomain Cys residues. When the fluorescence was evaluated using a fluorescence spectrometer, a significant antigen-dependent fluorescence increase was observed for single TAMRA- and double ATTO520-labeled UQ-bodies (Fig. 5, b and c). Specifically, double ATTO520-labeled UQ-body showed an 11-fold increase, and retained a low EC50 of 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M. Also, single TAMRA-labeled UQ body showed a 7.0-fold increase with a lower EC50 of 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22128\u2005M. In contrast, single ATTO520- and double TAMRA-labeled UQ-bodies showed a relatively modest antigen-dependent response of up to 3.6- and 2.4-fold, respectively. The contrasting responses of these two dyes probably reflect the differences in their quenching and dimerization behaviors (see discussion)."

We found that upon the addition of BGP-C7 peptide, the beads began to fluoresce, which was readily observed with visual inspection. Next, detection of the antigen on agarose beads was performed. When streptavidin-agarose beads were immobilized with or without biotinylated antigen (bioBGP-C11) peptide, and added with or without UQ-bodies, only the beads with both the antigen peptide and UQ-bodies showed intense fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S6b).",
                        "Bone homeostasis is dependent on the balance of deposition by osteoblast and resorption by osteoclasts. This dynamic process is responsible for the continuous remodeling of bone tissue and is crucial for maintenance of bone size, shape, and integrity12. To identify osteoblasts in the tissue, markers such as bone-type alkaline phosphatase (BAP) are often used. However, conventional enzymatic assay for BAP was not specific enough, while typical immunoassay needs multiple steps for the detection. Since BGP represents a more specific mature osteoblast marker, imaging of BGPs produced by differentiated osteosarcoma cells was performed. Human osteosarcoma U2O2 cells were induced for differentiation to osteoblasts using 100\u2005nM vitamin D3 (VD3). After incubation for 36\u2005h, UQ-bodies were added to the cells, and directly observed using microscopy without washing. As shown in Fig. 5, e and f, a clear UQ-body-dependent fluorescence of VD3-treated cells was observed inside and/or around individual cells. Since most BGP secreted by normal osteoblast is deposited in extracellular bone matrix13, the observed intracellular fluorescence might represent internalized BGP due to added UQ-body. On the contrary, the U2OS cells not treated with VD3 showed lower fluorescence, probably reflecting lower production of BGP as reported14. Collectively, the result demonstrated the utility of the UQ-body as a handy live cell imaging/assay tool."

However, it was also equally possible that if the stability was too high, TAMRA could not penetrate into the VH/VL interface where the Trp-mediated quenching occurs. Because the primary structure of our recombinant Fab is very close to its native counterpart, this result suggested that in natural antibodies, the transient opening and closing of the VH/VL interface also occurs, which allows the entry of hydrophobic small molecules.",

In contrast, double ATTO520-labeled UQ-body demonstrated a higher sensitivity and response (Fig. 5b). This difference most likely reflected the dyes' similar yet distinct chemical structures (Supplementary Fig. S7). Compared with TAMRA, ATTO520 is less hydrophobic due to its smaller size and positive charge, and this resulted in its lower H dimer propensity. Conversely, double TAMRA-labeled UQ-bodies with different linker lengths (C0, C2 and C5) showed absorption peaks at a shorter wavelength, which indicated the presence of an H dimer (Supplementary Fig. S8). This result strongly supported a higher but difficult-to-release quenching of these UQ-bodies in the absence of antigen.",

However, if we inject the UQ-bodies into the cells by an appropriate method, clearer visualization of various intracellular targets and their modifications than previously reported with conventional fluorescence-labeled antibodies15 will be possible. Although optimization of the dye and its number might improve its performance, the observed potential to convert many antibody clones to UQ-bodies will innovate and redefine future immunodiagnostics, biosensing, and bioimaging studies."
