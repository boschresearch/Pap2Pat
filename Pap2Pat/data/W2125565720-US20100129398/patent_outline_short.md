# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- introduce PRRS disease

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe PRRS virus and its effects

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce method for treating PRRS
- describe administration of PRRSV antigen
- outline variations in dosage and administration

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe PRRSV infection study in three age groups of pigs
- present results of viremia and immune responses in different age groups

### Results

- describe effect of virulence on immune responses
- describe effect of animal age on immune responses
- present correlations between different assays
- present statistical correlations between different assays
- describe consequences of PRRSV infection dependent on pig age
- describe mechanisms of PRRSV resistance in older pigs
- describe role of IL-10 in PRRSV infection
- describe antigen-specific adaptive immune response in pigs
