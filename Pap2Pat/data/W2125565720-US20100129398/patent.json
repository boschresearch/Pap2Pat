                        "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is viewed by many as the most important disease currently affecting the pig industry worldwide. The syndrome first was described in 1987 in the United States as \u201cmystery swine disease\u201d and rapidly spread across the globe. It causes severe reproduction losses, is associated with increased mortality due to secondary infections, and is linked to reduced feed conversion and average daily weight gain. Unfortunately, control of the virus that causes PRRS has proven to be difficult.",
                        "Transmission of the PRRS virus (PRRSV) can, and often does, occur through direct contact between infected and susceptible pigs. Transmission over very short distances by air or through semen also may occur. Once infected, the virus can remain in the blood of adults for about two weeks, and in infected pigs for one to two months or more. Infected boars may shed the virus in the semen for more than 100 days. This long period of viremia significantly increases the possibility of transmission. In addition, the PRRS virus can cross the placenta during the last third of the gestation period to infect piglets in utero and cause stillbirth or weak-born piglets.",
                        "All types and sizes of herds, including those with high or ordinary health status or from either indoor or outdoor units, can be infected with PRRS virus. Infected herds may experience severe reproductivity losses, as well as, increased levels of post weaning pneumonia with poor growth. The reproductive phase typically lasts for two to three months; however, post weaning problems often become endemic. The reproductive disease is characterized by an abortion outbreak that affects both sows and gilts in the last term of gestation. Premature farrowings around 109 and 112 days of gestation occur. The number of stillbirths and weak-born piglets increases and results in a considerable increase in pre-weaning mortality.",
                        "The respiratory phase traditionally has been seen in the nursery, especially in continuous flow nurseries. However, respiratory problems caused by PRRS virus can also be seen in the finisher as part of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). A reduction in growth rate, an increase in the percentage of unmarketable pigs, and elevated post weaning mortality can occur. Diagnostic findings indicate high levels of pneumonia that associate with the PRRS virus together with a wide variety of other microbials commonly seen as secondary infectious agents. Bacterial isolates may include Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus suis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus suis, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and Pasteurella multocida among others. Viral agents commonly involved include swine influenza virus and porcine respiratory corona virus. Affected pigs rarely respond to high levels of medication, and all-in/all-out systems have failed to control the disease.",
                        "Pigs recovered from a PRRS infection will develop an immune response, which under normal circumstances will protect them from being infected again by the same virus strain. However, PRRS virus has the ability to change (by mutation or recombination); and therefore, new viral strains may arise. In such cases, cross protection between strains may not exist, and new outbreaks may be observed in farms that had been infected previously.",
                        "Age- and viral strain-dependent variation in porcine responses to PRRSV infection was previously reported. However, the significance of the findings is uncertain since mature adult pigs were not included, quantitative viral loads were not determined, the viruses were extremely different in genetics as well as virulence, and there was coincident disease in the control group.",
                        "Better treatments or vaccines that can reduce the severity of disease, reduce infectivity, or prevent PRRSV are needed."

                        "The invention provides methods of treating or reducing the severity of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, as well as, methods of preventing PRRSV infection.",
                        "Generally, the method is for treating or reducing the severity of or incidence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. \u201cTreating or reducing the severity of or incidence of\u201d refers to a reduction in the severity of clinical signs, symptoms, and/or pathological signs normally associated with infection, up to and including prevention of any such signs or symptoms. \u201cPathological signs\u201d refers to evidence of infection that is found microscopically or during necropsy (e.g. lung lesions).",
                        "The method generally includes the step of administering a therapeutic amount of a PRRSV antigen to a swine of a defined age or age range. For example, in one aspect of the invention, one therapeutic amount of a PRRSV antigen may be administered to a piglet about three-weeks-old or younger, and different therapeutic amounts of the antigen may be administered to a pig between about 3 weeks of age and 4 weeks of age. Similarly, an even different therapeutic amount might be administered to a pig between about four weeks and sixteen weeks of age (or any age within this range, e.g. five weeks to six weeks of age, nine weeks to fifteen weeks of age, seven weeks to ten weeks of age, etc), or to pig older than sixteen weeks, such as an adult sow.",
                        "Preferably the PRRSV antigen is a modified live PRRS virus and more preferably the PRRSV antigen is Ingelvac\u00ae ATP. The PRRSV antigen can be administered in any conventional fashion and in the case of Ingelvac\u00ae ATP, the preferred method of administration is nasally. It is preferred that the administered PRRSV antigen provide its benefits of treating or reducing the severity of or incidence of PRRSV infection after a single dose, as with Ingelvac\u00ae ATP, however, if other antigens are selected, they will be administered in their conventional fashion, which may include one or more booster doses after the initial administration. Those of skill in the art will be able to determine appropriate dosing levels based on the PRRSV antigen selected and the age range of the animal to which the antigen will be administered.",
                        "In one aspect of the invention, a particular dose regimen is selected based on the age of the pig and antigen selected for administration. This will permit pigs of any age to receive the most efficacious dose based on the present invention's discovery that PRRSV infection (from both wild type exposure and vaccination) is cleared much more quickly in older animals. Thus, in some respects, vaccination of older animals is preferred but that vaccination of younger pigs, including those three weeks of age and younger helps to induce active immunity and is still very beneficial as having higher viral titers in three week old pigs may induce better immunity. As shown herein, animal age is a critical factor in PRRS control and may be a factor that impacts vaccination and development of an effective immune response. Thus, age, innate, and active immunity are important and need to be considered in control strategies.",
                        "In a preferred method, a therapeutic amount of Ingelvac\u00ae ATP is administered to a pig or piglet that is about three weeks old. The amount selected will vary depending upon the age of the pig. Alternatively, a different therapeutic amount of Ingelvac\u00ae ATP is administered to a pig or piglet that is older than about 3 weeks, and this amount will also change as the pig receiving such an administration ages or becomes older. Accordingly, pigs about four weeks old, six weeks old, eight weeks old, ten weeks old, twelve weeks old, fourteen weeks old, sixteen weeks old, a gilt, or a sow will all receive different amounts. Preferably, the Ingelvac\u00ae ATP is administered nasally; however, other methods of administration such as intramuscular, dermal, retinal, oral, subcutaneous, and the like, that are well-known and used in the art may be used.",
                        "A preferred therapeutic dose of Ingelvac\u00ae ATP is about two milliliters (2 mLs). Skilled artisans will recognize that the dosage amount may be varied based on the breed, size, and other physical factors of the individual subject, as well as, the specific formulation of Ingelvac\u00ae ATP and the route of administration.",
                        "Preferably, the Ingelvac\u00ae ATP is administered in a single dose; however, additional doses may be useful. Again, the skilled artisan will recognize through the present invention that the dosage and number of doses is influenced by the age and physical condition of the subject pig, as well as, other considerations common to the industry and the specific conditions under which the Ingelvac\u00ae ATP is administered.",
                        "In another aspect of the present invention a method of determining the proper timing and dosage for vaccination of a pig against PRRSV is provided. The method generally comprises the steps of determining at least one variable selected from the group consisting of age, health status, innate immunity level and active immunity level, of the pig, and adjusting a standard dosage level to account for these variables. Generally, the innate immunity level and active immunity level will be determined by referring to a standard comprised of average levels from a population of pigs of similar age and health status. In a particularly preferred method, all variable are considered prior to determining the optimum dosage level and timing of administration.",
                        "In one aspect of the present invention, provided herein is a method of detecting a virulent PRRSV infection in piglets comprising the step of periodically obtaining a blood sample for the piglet and monitoring the levels of IL-10 in blood serum of said piglet, wherein an increase in IL-10 concentration up to 40 pg/mL indicates a virulent PRRSV infection.",
                        "In another aspect of the present invention, provided herein is a method of differentiating between viral persistence and viral pathogenesis in pigs, comprising the steps of determining the age of the pig; obtaining a blood serum sample from the pig and determining the serum concentration of IL-10 in the blood serum, wherein if the pig is a less than 8 weeks old, the presence of IL-10 concentration up to 40 pg/mL indicates virulent pathogenesis and not persistent viremia.",
                        "In one aspect of the present invention, provided herein is a method of gauging the effect of anti-viral treatment in piglets or screening an anti-viral compositions comprising the steps of administering a candidate composition to the piglet and monitoring the level of IL-10 in the blood serum of the piglet, wherein the composition capable reducing IL-10 levels to the lowest level in the shortest treatment period is the most effective composition.",

                        "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of age and immune response on PRRSV in vivo replication, persistence, and its ability to cause disease. Immune responses were elicited and evaluated among three different age groups, each of which received three different treatments of varying virulence. Results of the study yielded new methods and compositions for treating a PRRSV infection that relate to the age at which innoculation against or treatment of PRRS infection occurs.",
                        "In one aspect of the invention, animal age, likely due to increased innate immune resistance, strongly influences the outcome of acute PRRSV infection, whereas an effective antibody response is triggered at a low threshold of infection that is independent of age. Prolonged infection is not due to IL-10-mediated immunosuppression, and PRRSV does not elicit a specific IFN \u03b3 response, especially in non-adult animals. Equivalent antibody responses are elicited in response to virulent and attenuated viruses, indicating that the antigenic mass necessary for an immune response is produced at a low level of infection, and is not predicted by viremic status. Thus, viral replication occurs in lung or lymphoid tissues even though viremia is not always observed.",
                        "A total of ninety pigs from the same PRRSV-free genetic source, comprising thirty pigs in each of three different age groups: three week old weaned piglets (herein referred to as three week old or 3 week piglets), growing pigs at 16-20 weeks of age (herein referred to as sixteen week old or 16 week pigs), and mature, non-bred sows at 3\u00b11 parity. On day 0, ten pigs from each age group received one of the following treatments: JA142 virulent PRRSV (parental isolate of vaccine), avirulent PRRSV (Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS ATP), or placebo. Viremia and the humoral response in the PRRSV-exposed animals were monitored for 63 days. The data collected illustrate distinct trends among the age groups.",
                        "The TCID50 evaluation of viremia following PRRSV exposure revealed that the three week old piglets generated the highest virus titers and maintained the live virus in the bloodstream the longest. A modest statistical difference was observed between sixteen week pigs and sows. These observations were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA analyses. Thus, age of exposure was found to significantly effect the viremic and immunological outcomes.",
                        "Weaned three week old piglets demonstrated higher viral genome titers and longer persistence in the blood than older animals. And, older animals, both sows and pigs sixteen to twenty weeks old, seroconverted sooner and achieved higher group average S/P ratios than the piglets.",
                        "Viral PRRS isolates of different virulence levels illicit distinct responses in the host. The parent virus (JA142) tended to induce detectable levels of virus in the sera about two days prior to that of the attenuated culture (Ingelvac\u00ae ATP). The JA142 virus generally replicated to higher overall titers (\u02dc2.0 logs via TCID50) in the sera as well as induced earlier seroconversion via PRRS IDEXX ELISA by about two or so days.",
                        "The TCID50 data show a distinct delay in viremia in all ages of pigs receiving the Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS ATP when compared to those pigs receiving the virulent JA142 challenge strain. These results further illustrate the known difference in virulence between the vaccine and its virulent parent strain. Further, a noticeable trend developed among pig ages within each treatment group. The youngest pigs achieved higher levels of viremia and retained those higher levels longer than both of the older groups of pigs.",
                        "Upon statistical analysis, the differences in levels of viremia over time when comparing data from all treatment groups are significant (p\u22660.05). Also, the differences within the ATP and the JA142 treatments are significant among all age groups.",
                        "By varying the age of the host at the time of infection, additional trends were revealed. The three week old piglets (three week piglets, 3 week piglets) displayed about 40 days of viremia via TCID50; whereas, the sixteen week old pigs (sixteen week pigs, 16 week pigs) and the sows displayed only two weeks of viremia. Regardless of the virus used as challenge, the three week piglets demonstrated about 2.0 logs higher levels of in vivo replication than the sixteen week pigs and the sows. Seroconversion tested via the PRRS IDEXX ELISA told a different story. The sows achieved higher overall S/P ratios as well as demonstrating increases in S/P ratio earlier than the younger groups of pigs.",
                        "The M. hyo IDEXX ELISA demonstrated an age effect at day 28. The sixteen weeks pigs seroconverted to the highest level, followed by the sows, and then the 3 week piglets. Both the sows and the 16 week pigs demonstrated a significantly different level of seroconversion when compared with the three week piglet S/P ratios."

                                "The primary parameter of this study is the virus isolation and quantification of the TCID50/mL assay (see FIG. 1). The animals receiving a treatment that contained a virus received equal viral loads. However, the JA142-challenged animals achieved high titers by day 1 of the study. This result confirms the ability of the virulent PRRS isolate to infect and begin in vivo replication rapidly. The titer of the ATP challenged animals began to increase about 2 days after the JA142-challenged animals. In addition, the ATP virus did not prove to be as efficient in the JA142-challenged animals at infection and in vivo replication to high titers. The peak titers for each age group were about 2 logs higher for the JA142 animals than the ATP animals. These results are in keeping with trends identified through previous PRRS studies.",
                                "The qPCR results (see FIG. 8) mimicked many of the trends demonstrated in the TCID50 results. The spike in titer began on the day 1 for both the JA142 animals and the ATP animals. These spikes could be due to the fact that this assay cannot differentiate between live and dead virus. But, there is a noticeable difference in the reported copies/mL between the treatment groups. The JA142 animals achieved nearly double the copies/mL by days 1 and 3 than the ATP animals. This relative increase may be due to the JA142 virus's ability to infect and replicate in vivo. The ATP virus was serially passed from its JA142 parent to adapt its affinity towards the MA104 cell culture over the typical swine host. The qPCR data also showed signs of virus in the sera for the duration of the study. Again, this observation is most likely due to the fact that the assay is not able to differentiate between live and dead virus. The qPCR assay also is more sensitive than the TCID50 assay. This difference would leave the group averages slightly higher for the entire study since no \u201cnegative\u201d animals are being averaged in with the rest of the respective group.",
                                "Results from the IDEXX PRRS ELISA (see FIG. 15) revealed a 4 day earlier occurrence for the seroconversion of the JA142 animals over the ATP animals. The JA142 animals began the increase in S/P ratio as of day 3 and peaked around day 14. However, the ATP animals commenced an increase of S/P ratios around day 7 and continued to climb until day 28. These data agree with trends identified in previous PRRS studies. Causes for this response could be that the ATP virus has been serially passed to prefer an artificial, non-swine cell line. The ATP takes longer to infect; therefore, it appears to take longer to induce an immune response. In addition, the JA142 infected isolate replicated to higher numbers faster in vivo than the ATP isolate possibly leading to quicker seroconversion.",
                                "**Effect of Animal Age on Immune Responses**",
                                "When comparing PRRS virus behavior in pigs of varying age, clear differences are illustrated relating to the duration of viremia, overall virus titer, and the speed and level of seroconversion. A slight difference was also noticed within the M. hyo assay.",
                                "The TCID50/mL assay shows that the 3 week piglets exhibit the longest duration of viremia (FIG. 1). The 3 week JA142 group gave positive assay results for live virus in the sera beginning on day 1 and lasting through day 42. Likewise, the 3 week ATP piglets proved to have detectable levels of live virus in their sera beginning after day 3 and lasting through the end of the study. In contrast, the assays performed on the sera from the 16 week pigs and the sows demonstrated detectable levels of virus beginning within the first few days and lasting around 2 weeks. The qPCR results (FIG. 8) do not demonstrate differences in the duration of viremia when comparing the different age groups. This result is most likely the result of the qPCR assay being unable to differentiate between live and dead virus. The detection and sensitivity of this assay is unable to demonstrate if any group of animals completely cleared the virus.",
                                "The peak TCID50 titers for the 3 week old piglets were 1 to 2 logs higher than the peak titers achieved by the 16 week pigs and the sows. The 3 week JA142 piglets developed an average peak titer of 4.5 logs, whereas the older JA142 animals achieved average peak titers around 2.8 logs. Likewise, the 3 week ATP piglets developed an average peak titer of 3.4 logs while the older ATP animals attained average peak titers around 1.5 logs. The qPCR results (FIG. 8) confirmed these findings. The data demonstrate that the 3 week animals are not as able to clear the virus or control its in vivo replication as efficiently as the older animals. This result may be due to the 3 week piglets having a weaker immune system or the fact that they may have more PRRSV susceptible cells than the older pigs. Both of these viewpoints would increase the virus's ability to infect and replicate to higher levels.",
                                "The IDEXX PRRS ELISA results also reveal differences among age groups. The sows seroconverted faster and achieved higher S/P ratios when compared to the 3 week piglets and the 16 week pigs. However, the 3 week piglets and the 16 week pigs show no significance until the end of the study for the JA142-challenged animals only. This difference is most likely due to the immaturity of the 3 week piglet immune system. The young immune system cannot activate its defenses fast enough to initiate fast and adequate seroconversion. This result further validates the idea that the 3 week piglets cannot efficiently control the in vivo replication or clear the virus. The immature immune system of the 3 week old piglets does not protect as well as the fully developed immune system of the 16 week pigs and the sows.",
                                "Finally the IDEXX M. hyo ELISA showed slight, non-statistical differences when comparing the S/P ratios among groups. Considering only the data for the 3 bleed days tested, all pigs reached peak S/P ratios on the same day (see FIG. 22). However, a minor difference does exist within the response between the ages. All of the 16 week pigs responded best and are grouped together. They are followed by the sows grouped together, and the 3 week piglets grouped together with the lowest overall S/P ratios. In general, the S/P ratios for the assay were so low that no statistical significance was found.",

                                "Correlations derived from comparing group mean results between two different assays rendered expected results. The TCID50 and quantitative PCR results yielded significant, positive correlations between all challenged groups. The correlations further illustrate the consistency within the different assays used to verify the viral behavior. A reason for a less than perfect positive correlation would be that the TCID50 assay can only detect live virus; whereas, the qPCR can detect both live and dead virus in sera. Comparisons between both the TCID50 and qPCR with the PRRS ELISA data yielded non-significant r values near or less than zero. This conclusion is the result of the virus replication and persistence behavior in vivo differing from the seroconversion behavior detected by the ELISA. Finally, the gross lung lesions and the PRRS specific IHC lung scores have an expected significant, positive overall correlation.",

There is also at least a statistically significant chance that any one of the JA142-challenged animals will have a higher titer than any other pig in the study. Finally, the strict controls yield a non-significant percentage of 50 when compared with other strict control pigs. These values remained zero for the duration of the study.",

Spearman coefficients of 1 show a positive correlation whereas a correlation coefficient of \u22121 shows a negative correlation. A significant p value <0.05 demonstrates a significant correlation, but not a significant difference. Table 1 illustrates the significant, positive correlation between the TCID50 and the qPCR results among all experimental groups. The TCID50 and the PRRS ELISA appear to have negative correlation.

Finally, there is a 50% chance that one of the control animals will have a higher titer than another control animal. These values are non-significant; however, these pigs' assay results had identical values for the duration of the study.",
                                "In one embodiment, the consequences of PRRSV infection are highly dependent on pig age. Viral growth is most extensive in piglets. For both virulent and attenuated PRRSV, peak viremia and duration are substantially greater in piglets. Finishers and sows show the same pattern of low level viremia for virulent viral infection that resolved within 2 weeks and approximately 50% of finishers and sows inoculated with attenuated PRRSV showed no viremia. The prolonged period of viremia commonly associated with PRRSV infection is based on studies in young pigs. Unexpectedly, viremia was found to be substantially reduced in growing and adult pigs indicating in one embodiment that the mechanisms of PRRSV resistance are developmentally regulated. Attenuated or lowly virulent PRRSV grow poorly in young pigs, but the frequent absence of viremia in older age pigs has not been documented previously.",
                                "In another aspect, the restriction in viral growth in older pigs is due to differences in innate immunity or in host cell permissiveness. Since as disclosed in example 5, onset of viremia is the same or earlier in finishers and sows compared to piglets, permissive macrophages are available at all times. Acute infection of pigs at about 20 weeks of age does not reduce the abundance of macrophages in lung or lymphoid tissues. Therefore, in another embodiment, suppression of PRRSV infection in older animals is due to more potent mechanisms of innate resistance. In another embodiment, PRRSV selectively induces an immunosuppressive response that blocks innate resistance in young pigs.",
                                "mRNA levels or secreted cytokines implicate IL-10 induction by PRRSV infection as a mechanism facilitating viral persistence. As described herein, IL-10 concentrations are significantly and transiently elevated as much as up to 40 pg/mL in serum of piglets infected with virulent PRRSV. However, older pigs frequently exhibit higher levels of IL-10, up to 800 pg/mL, before infection and when uninfected. Since the level of IL-10 prior to infection had no effect on the level of viremia, since peak viremia occurred in piglets one week before the appearance of IL-10, and since it was not observed in piglets exposed to attenuated PRRSV, in one embodiment, IL-10 production in piglets is a direct and predictive consequence of viral virulence and pathogenesis, rather than being the cause of viral persistence.",
                                "Accordingly and in one embodiment provided herein is a method of detecting a virulent PRRSV infection in piglets comprising the step of monitoring the levels of IL-10 in blood serum of said piglet, wherein an increase in IL-10 concentration up to 40 pg/mL indicates a virulent PRRSV infection. In another embodiment provided herein is a method of differentiating between viral persistence and viral pathogenesis in pigs comprising the steps of determining the age of the pig, obtaining a blood serum sample from the pig and determining the serum concentration of IL-10 in the blood serum, wherein if the pig is a less than 8 weeks old the presence of IL-10 concentration up to 40 pg/mL indicates virulent pathogenesis and not viremia persistence. In one embodiment provided herein is a method of gauging the effect of anti-viral treatment in piglets or screening anti-viral compositions comprising the steps of administering a candidate composition to the piglet and monitoring the level of IL-10 in the blood serum of the piglet, wherein the composition capable reducing IL-10 levels to the lowest level in the shortest time is the most effective.",
                                "In contrast to their effects on infection, pig age and viral virulence had relatively little impact on the antigen-specific adaptive immune response, even though viremia was not observed in nearly half (9/20) of juvenile and adult pigs. Regardless of the viral strain used to challenge pigs, all animals seroconverted, and all groups showed the same level of antibody by HerdChek\u00ae PRRS 2XR ELISA at day 35. Variation in the intensity of antibody responses appear to be random since differences in kinetics or intensity of response determined by one assay are not reproduced when the same sera is analyzed by another assay as demonstrated by comparison of the group responses to N and nsp2Hp in FIG. 27.",
                                "In one aspect, antigen-specific immunological competence is achieved in pigs by day 74 of gestation, i.e. midway in fetal development. At 3 weeks of age, piglets show strong IgM and IgG antibody responses to the protein antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and a variety of PRRSV proteins following infection. Therefore, even if antigen-specific adaptive immunity is not fully developed in piglets, the failure to achieve more rapid elimination of viremia does not appear to be related to the adaptive immune response.",
                                "Molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity to viral infection are extensive, but little is known about their role in resistance to PRRSV infection. Cellular immunity mediated by NK cells or other cell types has not been explored. Absence of IFN\u03b1 induction early in infection is well described and believed to help explain prolonged infection. No comparative studies of differences in interferon responses or other innate immune mechanisms exist that might explain the marked age-dependent differences in infection outcomes in young versus older pigs. Interleukin-10, which has been suggested to suppress anti-PRRSV immunity, has been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokine production and reduce disease severity in a swine model of bacterial pleuropneumonia. In another embodiment, IL-10 production is pathognomonic of virulent infection rather than a cause of prolonged infection.",
                                "In another embodiment, differences in circulating IFN\u03b3 secreting cells do not account for differences in age-dependent infection. Rather, they indicate that finishers are more similar to piglets, a conclusion that is in contrast to the similarity between finishers and sows in control of viral infection. The interpretation of IFN\u03b3 secreting cell frequencies is confounded since IFN\u03b3 in pigs is produced by a wide variety of cell types, including activated CD8+T cells, natural killer T cells, and \u03b3\u03b4T cells, in addition to type 1 CD4+T cells.",
                                "The lack of a substantial effect of pig age on antigen-specific immune responses in contrast to a significant age dependent effect on the kinetics of infection supports the concept that control of PRRSV viremia may not be dependent on adaptive immune responses. In one embodiment, infection is controlled though not eliminated by a deficiency in permissive macrophages. A similar phenomenon operates in another embodiment to control PRRSV viremia, which occurs before neutralizing antibody responses are observed. This occurs in one embodiment through interference with virus binding to its CD163 receptor on macrophages.",
                                "In one embodiment, all groups of pigs exposed to PRRSV develop equivalent adaptive antibody and cell mediated immune responses irrespective of the kinetics or magnitude of viremia. This indicates that the requirements of antigenic mass and mode of presentation for an immune response to PRRSV are met at a low level of infection in the absence of viremia. In another embodiment, viremia is an insensitive indicator of infection by lowly virulent or attenuated PRRSV strains, especially in growing and mature swine. In one embodiment, resolution of viremia does not require an adaptive immune response. While adaptive immunity most likely is essential for protection against future challenge, control of primary infection relies in one embodiment on innate mechanisms of immunity that are more effective at about 15 weeks of age and older.",

Attenuated PRRSV in piglets also produced a prolonged viremia that was delayed and reduced in magnitude, and in finishers and sows, about half the animals showed no viremia. Despite marked differences in infection, antibody responses were observed in all animals irrespective of age, with older pigs tending to seroconvert sooner and achieve higher antibody levels than 3-week-old animals. Interferon \u03b3 (IFN \u03b3) secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells were more abundant in sows but not specifically increased by PRRSV infection in any age group, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in blood were not correlated with PRRSV infection status.",

Prolonged infection was not due to IL-10-mediated immunosuppression, and PRRSV did not elicit a specific IFN \u03b3 response, especially in non-adult animals. Equivalent antibody responses were elicited in response to virulent and attenuated viruses, indicating that the antigenic mass necessary for an immune response is produced at a low level of infection, and is not predicted by viremic status.

                                "Piglets, which were the fastest growing group, showed a significantly reduced average daily weight gain (ADWG) at 28 and 63 days when infected with virulent PRRSV (Table 6). By contrast, inoculation with attenuated ATP PRRSV had no effect on ADWG in piglets. Twenty-week old pigs only showed reduced weight gain at 28 days when infected with virulent JA142 PRRSV (Table 7). There was no effect of PRRSV on weight gain in mature sows.",
                                "Characteristics of Infection: Twenty-six of 30 animals in all age groups receiving virulent, JA142 PRRSV were viremic by day 1 and 100% were viremic on day 3 (Table 7). Viremia peaked on day 3 in finishers and sows with mean group titers of about 3.0 log 10 TCID50/mL (FIG. 1). All animals in these groups cleared virus below the level of TCID50 detection (\u2266101) by day 11 and, with one exception, remained negative to the end of the study. The exception, a sow, showed a low titer one time, on day 42. By contrast, viremia in piglets peaked on day 1 at a significantly higher titer of 4.5 log 10 TCID50/mL. All piglets were viremic through 14 days of infection, and 6 of 7 were viremic at 21 days (Table 8). All piglets were negative at day 35.",
                                "The animals exposed to ATP PRRSV showed a substantially different pattern of viremia. The highest viremic load was observed in piglets, as was observed with virulent JA142, but virus was not detected until day 8, when 7 of 10 animals were positive. Two animals remained negative until day 21 (Table 8). Peak viremia, at 3.3 log 10 TCID50/mL, occurred on day 21 and viral load declined slowly and variably. Seven of 10 piglets cleared the ATP PRRSV by day 42, but sporadic low level positives were observed for the duration of the study. By contrast, in growing finishers and sows, only 3 to 4 of 10 animals had detectable levels of viremia on day 3 (Table 8). Peak mean group titers were reached on day 3 in finishers (0.73 log 10 TCID50/mL) and on day 8 in sows (1.49 log 10 TCID50/mL), but variation in viremia among animals was substantial. Five finishers and four sows did not show viremia during the entire study. Viremia was not observed in finishers or sows after 11 days except for 2 finishers that were viremic on day 21. All 30 non-challenged control animals remained PRRSV-negative for the duration of the 63 day study.",
                                "Viremia also was determined by qRT-PCR; the results were significantly correlated with viral isolation on MA-104 cells. Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 and all were significant (p<0.05). The qRT-PCR findings confirmed the TCID50/mL results obtained by growth on MA-104 cells, indicating that both the virulent and attenuated strains grew equivalently in cell culture. In young piglets infected with virulent JA142, viremia was high on day 1 and remained high until day 28, after which it declined substantially. In finishers and sows exposed to JA142, viremia was high from day 1 to day 14, then declined dramatically. Attenuated ATP PRRSV elicited similar kinetics in young, growing and mature pigs; a gradual increase until day 21 followed by a gradual decline in piglets, and brief, low-level viremia in finishers and sows.",
                                "Except for day 1, when the copies/mL of viral RNA were significantly different among all three age groups, JA142-infected piglets had significantly higher levels of viremia than both finishers and sows, which were equivalent (ttest, p<0.05). ATP PRRSV-treated piglets also had significantly higher levels of viremia by qRT-PCR than finishers or sows on days 14 through 42, day 56, and day 63.",
                                "Characteristics of the immune response: All pigs showed the same serological response to acute infection with virulent JA142 regardless of age. As shown in FIG. 15, all group means were positive at day 8 and peaked at 14 to 21 days, as determined by HerdChek PRRS 2XR ELISA. All groups maintained a positive sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio for the duration of the study (FIG. 15). Sows showed a substantial decline in S/P ratio after 35 days, while piglets showed the highest average S/P ratio from 49 to 63 days after infection.",
                                "Animals inoculated with attenuated ATP PRRSV seroconverted at 10 to 14 days, with sows responding on average more rapidly than finishers and piglets. The response of sows to attenuated ATP PRRSV peaked at 14 days, whereas finishers showed increased mean S/P ratios until day 28 and piglets showed a gradual increase in S/P ratio up to 35 days. Thereafter, animals appeared to equalize and then maintain comparable S/P ratios for the duration of the study.",
                                "In FIG. 15, the antibody response of piglets to attenuated PRRSV appeared to be delayed. To further investigate this possibility, we examined antibody responses to two specific viral polypeptides. The kinetics of anti-N responses were essentially the same among all ages as determined by HerdChek\u00ae PRRS 2XR ELISA, including the declining response of sows infected with virulent PRRSV, and the increasing level of anti-N antibodies from days 49 to 63 in piglets infected with virulent PRRSV (FIG. 27A). The response of piglets to attenuated PRRSV was not significantly different from that of other age groups. Antibody responses to a second viral antigen, an antigenic polypeptide fragment of nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2Hp), showed another pattern of reactivity. Here, virulent JA142.",
                                "PRRSV elicited antibody responses that peaked at 21 to 28 days in all three age groups, then declined slightly in piglets and finishers, and substantially in sows (FIG. 27B). Attenuated ATP PRRSV elicited lower levels of antinsp2Hp that peaked at 28 days and were maintained for the duration of the study, or declined slightly in piglets (FIG. 27B). Anti-nsp2Hp responses were lowest in sows inoculated with attenuated PRRSV (FIG. 27B), but the same group showed a strong response in HerdChek\u00ae PRRS 2XR ELISA (FIG. 15). Thus, pigs of all ages mount a humoral immune response to both virulent and attenuated PRRSV, though its appearance tends to be more rapid in response to virulent virus exposure.",
                                "Cell-mediated immune responses were examined by IFN\u03b3 ELISPOT for evidence that they could explain anti-PRRSV immunity that was not accounted for by antibody responses. Uninfected healthy piglets and finishers showed very low levels of constitutive IFN\u03b3 secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) alone or after in vitro stimulation with virulent PRRSV, whereas mitogenic stimulation increased the frequency of secreting cells (FIG. 28A-C, open circles and open squares). The outcome was similar in piglets and finishers inoculated with attenuated PRRSV, although in vitro stimulation with virulent PRRSV increased secreting cell numbers (FIG. 28D,E). PBMC from piglets and finishers infected with virulent PRRSV showed the highest levels of IFN\u03b3 secretion under all culture conditions, although there was no consistent change over time (FIG. 28 G-I). Sows under all conditions of in vivo virus exposure and in vitro culture had higher frequencies of IFN\u03b3 secreting cells than did piglets and finishers (p<10\u22126, \u03c72 test). In other respects the trends were the same as in piglets and finishers. Thus, cell-mediated immunity, based on IFN\u03b3 secreting cell responses, showed age-dependent variation that was not observed in anti-PRRSV antibody responses.",
                                "The level and duration of viremia were significantly greater in piglets than in finishers and sows. Therefore, IL-10 levels were determined in serum since it has been implicated in delayed immune responses to PRRSV infection. In piglets infected with virulent PRRSV, IL-10 levels were significantly increased in serum at 8-14 days of infection (FIG. 29A, p<0.05). There was no difference between pigs inoculated with attenuated virus or controls. IL-10 levels were more variable in finishers and sows, and there was no difference due to treatment (FIG. 29 B, C). In contrast to piglets, approximately half of the finishers and sows before virus exposure had measurable levels of IL-10 that were maintained throughout the study. The results indicate that increased IL-10 levels in serum are associated with age, and that in piglets, increased IL-10 levels are related to viral pathogenesis but do not modulate antiviral immunity.",
                                "The data presented here show that the consequences of PRRSV infection are highly dependent on pig age. Viral growth is most extensive in piglets. For both virulent and attenuated PRRSV, peak viremia and duration were substantially greater in piglets. Finishers and sows showed the same pattern of low level viremia for virulent viral infection that resolved within 2 weeks, and approximately 50% of finishers and sows inoculated with attenuated PRRSV showed no viremia. The prolonged period of viremia commonly associated with PRRSV infection is based on studies in young pigs. The finding that viremia is substantially reduced in growing and adult pigs is novel and indicates that the mechanisms of PRRSV resistance are developmentally regulated."
