                    "paragraphs": [
                        "A variety of diseases are modulated by bacterial and other toxins. Antitoxins to treat many such diseases exist, often as antibodies against the relevant toxin molecule. For example, antibodies against diphtheria are raised (classically, in horses) and administered as an antitoxin against diphtheria. However, even where such antitoxins are available, they may not provide optimal protection, and often have undesired side effects. Moreover, for some serious illnesses such as Bacillus anthracis infection, effective antitoxins are not available at all.",
                        "Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis1. The disease is elicited when spores are inhaled, ingested or transmitted through open wounds in the skin. Inhalational anthrax is the deadliest form of the disease primarily because it is difficult to diagnose in a timely manner. Disease symptoms are initially nonspecific and systemic dissemination of anthrax toxin can occur prior to antibiotic treatment2. The deliberate release of B. anthracis spores in the U.S. in 2001 with the ensuing human fatalities and enormous cleanup costs has underscored the need for better detection, treatment and prevention of anthrax.",
                        "The toxic effects of anthrax are predominantly due to an AB-type toxin made up of a single, receptor-binding B subunit and two enzymatic A subunits3. The A subunits are edema factor (EF, 89 kD), an adenylate cyclase that raises intracellular cAMP levels4, and lethal factor (LF, 90 kD), a zinc protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases5,6. The receptor binding B subunit is protective antigen (PA), which is initially synthesized as an 83 kD precursor. Upon receptor binding, PA83 is cleaved by furin into a 63 kD product, which forms heptamers that bind EF to form edema toxin (EdTx) and LF to form lethal toxin (LeTx)3. Two anthrax toxin receptors, widely distributed on human cells, have been identified: anthrax toxin receptor/tumor endothelial marker 8 (ANTXR1)7 and capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (ANTXR2)8. Although both receptors bind PA through a 200 amino acid extracellular von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, the VWA domain of ANTXR2 has a 1000-fold higher binding affinity for PA than the VWA domain of ANTXR1. In addition, ANTXR2 has been shown to mediate intoxication in vivo9-11. Recently, the LDL receptor-related protein LRP6 was shown to function as a co-receptor for anthrax toxin internalization12.",
                        "The potential use of anthrax and other diseases as weapons of bioterrorism has prompted increased efforts to develop better antitoxins and vaccines. In the case of anthrax, protective immunity to B. anthracis infection is conferred by antibodies against PA, which is the primary component of anthrax-vaccine adsorbed (AVA; Biothrax), the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine in the US. Although AVA is safe and effective, it is molecularly ill-defined, can cause adverse reactions and is administered in a lengthy immunization schedule (6 doses over 18 months)13. A second-generation vaccine based on recombinant PA adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant is currently in development. Preliminary data indicate that it is less potent than AVA and it is likely that several immunizations will be required to confer protection in humans14. Thus, the development of a well-characterized vaccine that induces rapid immunity after a single injection remains an important goal.",
                        "A general and widely adaptable vaccine platform to raise an immune response against anthrax and/or other serious diseases would be highly desirable. The present invention provides such a platform for use as either an antitoxin or a vaccine platform."

                        "The present invention provides a general and widely adaptable antitoxin and vaccine platform. Recombinant nodavirus-derived virus like particles (VLPs) display toxin binding domains, and can be used as a multivalent antitoxin. In addition, these VLPs can be decorated with toxin, providing a multivalent immunogen that can be used to raise an immune response against the displayed toxin moieties. In one particularly useful example, anthrax antitoxins and immunogens are provided for use in treating or preventing anthrax infection.",
                        "Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention provides an antitoxin comprising a nodavirus-derived virus like particle (VLP) that displays a heterologous toxin binding domain.",
                        "In one particularly preferred embodiment, the antitoxin comprises an anthrax antitoxin and the heterologous toxin binding domain comprises a polypeptide sequence that binds to a component of an anthrax toxin. For example, the polypeptide sequence optionally binds to anthrax protective antigen (PA). In this example, the polypeptide sequence can include a PA binding subsequence of an extracellular von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, e.g., an ANTRX2 protein VWA domain. In one specific example, the ANTRX2 VWA domain includes residues 38-218 of the VWA domain.",
                        "The VLP can be derived from any of a variety of nodaviruses. In one preferred embodiment, the VLP is derived from Flock House Virus (FHV). FHV and other nodaviruses comprise loop domains on the capsid/coat proteins of the virus, into which heterologous polypeptide sequences can be inserted. For example, the ANTRX2 VWA domain can be inserted in place of residues 265-267 of a FHV coat protein of the VLP. Up to about 180 copies of the heterologous polypeptide (e.g., toxin binding domain) can be displayed on an exterior surface of the VLP.",
                        "In a related aspect, the invention provides an immunogenic composition comprising a nodavirus-derived virus like particle (VLP) that comprises a heterologous immunogen binding domain, which binding domain is bound to a heterologous immunogen. This \u201cdecorated\u201d VLP can be used as a polyvalent immunogen and can act as a potent vaccine against the immunogen. In one preferred but non-limiting example, the binding domain includes a VWA domain of capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG-2, also known as ANTRX2) and the heterologous immunogen is derived from an anthrax toxin (e.g., part or all of anthrax PA).",
                        "The heterologous immunogen that is used to decorate the VLP can be derived from more than one immunogen or more than one immunogenic domain. For example, the immunogen can include a first domain that is bound by the binding domain, and a second domain that is heterologous to the first domain. The first and second domains can be recombinantly fused and expressed as a fusion protein. For example, the binding domain can be derived from a VWA domain of CMG-2, while the first domain of the heterologous immunogen is derived from a part of anthrax PA that is recognized (bound) by the VWA domain of CMG-2. The second domain of the heterologous immunogen is optionally derived from another vaccine target of interest, e.g., a toxin protein other than PA, such as a ricin toxin or a botulinum toxin. Furthermore, compositions of the invention can include multivalent vaccine compositions that include two or more different second domains, whether displayed on a single VLP, or multiple VLPs in a single injection formulation.",
                        "Thus, the invention also includes an immunogenic composition that includes a viral nanoparticle derived from a nodavirus that also includes a heterologous immunogen binding domain. In this aspect, the viral nanoparticle is decorated with at least one immunogen, the immunogen including a first domain that is bound by the heterologous immunogen binding domain, and a second domain that is heterologous to the first domain. For example, the viral nanoparticle can be derived from flock house virus and the heterologous binding domain can include a VWA domain of capillary morphogenesis protein 2. The first domain of the at least one immunogen can include a portion of a PA domain of an anthrax toxin that is bound by the VWA domain, while the second domain can be derived from a toxin protein such as a ricin toxin or botulinum toxin.",
                        "Optionally, the immunogenic composition can be multivalent. For example, the viral nanoparticle can be decorated with at least two different immunogens. Thus, in one illustrative example, the two different immunogens each have a first domain and a second domain, with the first domain being the same for each of the at least two immunogens. The second domain is different for each of the immunogens, and the first domain is heterologous to the second domain.",
                        "Alternately or additionally, the composition can provide a multivalent immunogen by providing different nanoparticles. For example, the composition can include a second viral nanoparticle that is different from the first viral nanoparticle, e.g., where the second viral particle is derived from a nodavirus and includes a second heterologous immunogen binding domain. The second viral nanoparticle is optionally decorated with at least one second immunogen that includes a first domain that is bound by the second heterologous immunogen binding domain. The second domain of the second immunogen is heterologous to the first domain. In one example, the second heterologous immunogen binding domain and the first heterologous immunogen binding domain are the same, the first domain of the first immunogen and the first domain of the second immunogen are the same, and the second domain of the first immunogen and the second domain of the second immunogen are different, thereby providing a multivalent immunogenic composition. For example, the first and second immunogen binding domains can be derived from a VWA domain of capillary morphogenesis protein 2, while the first domain of the first and second immunogens are derived from anthrax PA. The second domain of the first and second immunogens are independently selected from, e.g., a toxin other than an anthrax toxin, a ricin toxin and a botulinum toxin.",
                        "In any of the embodiments herein, steric crowding can limit the number of heterologous immunogens that decorate the VLP. For example, when the VLP is decorated with bound anthrax PA, the VLP typically includes 180 binding domains coupled to up to a maximum of about 120 heterologous immunogens.",
                        "Accordingly, the invention provides an immunogenic composition that includes a nodavirus-derived VLP such as an FHV having a heterologous immunogen derived from an anthrax toxin such as anthrax PA.",
                        "In a related aspect, the invention provides a method of antitoxin therapy to treat a toxin in a patient. The method includes identifying a patient in need of antitoxin therapy; and, administering to the patient an antitoxin that comprises a nodavirus-derived virus like particle (VLP) that comprises a heterologous toxin binding domain. The binding domain binds the toxin in the patient, thereby acting as an antitoxin.",
                        "A variety of applications are provided herein. The patient can be a human patient or a veterinary patient. In one aspect, the patient is infected with anthrax and the binding domain binds to a component of an anthrax toxin. All of the features noted above with respect to antitoxin compositions are applicable here as well, e.g., the VLP can be derived from FHV or another nodavirus, the binding domain can include a heterologous VWA domain of a ANTRX2 protein, bound by a PA domain of the anthrax toxin, etc.",
                        "Administration can be, e.g., by i.v. or i.p. administration of the VLP to the patient, or any other administration method that brings the antitoxin into contact with toxin in the patient. The VLP typically binds the toxin in a dose-dependent manner and the method can include selecting a dosage regimen for administration of the VLP that is capable of ameliorating the effect of the toxin in the patient.",
                        "In a similar aspect, a method of vaccinating a patient with an immunogen decorated nodavirus derived VLP is provided. The method includes binding an immunogen to an immunogen binding site displayed on the VLP; and, administering the resulting immunogen decorated VLP to a patient, thereby vaccinating the patient against the immunogen.",
                        "As with the preceding methods, the patient can be a human or veterinary patient. Administration to the patient can be done via injection, e.g., s.c. or i.m. injection.",
                        "The features described for vaccine compositions are applicable to this embodiment as well. For example, the immunogen can be derived from an anthrax PA, the VLP can be derived from Flock House Virus or another nodavirus and the heterologous immunogen binding site can include a VWA domain of an ANTXR2 protein, etc.",
                        "Thus, in one embodiment, a method of vaccinating a patient against anthrax infection is provided. The method includes providing a composition comprising a nodavirus-derived VLP that comprises or is decorated with an anthrax-derived immunogen; and, administering the composition to a patient, thereby vaccinating the patient against the anthrax-derived immunogen.",
                        "General methods of vaccinating a patient against infection are also a feature of the invention. The methods include, e.g., providing a composition comprising a nodavirus-derived VLP that comprises an immunogen binding site recombinantly expressed as part of the VLP, wherein the binding site is bound, in the composition, to an immunogen, where the immunogen comprises a first domain that is bound by the binding domain and a second domain that is heterologous to the first domain. The composition is administered to a patient, thereby vaccinating the patient against the immunogen.",
                        "Any of the features noted herein with respect to the relevant compositions of the invention are applicable to these method embodiments as well. Thus, for example, the toxin binding moiety can bind to anthrax PA, where the first domain is derived from an anthrax PA, while the second domain is derived from, e.g., ricin toxin or botulinum A toxin. Further any of the features noted in respect to multivalent immunogenic compositions are applicable to this method as well, e.g., where the VLP comprises a plurality of toxin binding moieties, and the composition comprises a plurality of different immunogens bound to the plurality of toxin binding moieties. Multiple VLPs can also be administered to provide multivalent protection, e.g., where the VLPs comprise different immunogens. Medicaments formulated for treatment by the methods herein are a feature of the invention."

                        "The invention provides nodavirus VLPs that comprise antitoxin activity, and that can also be decorated with an immunogen of interest to boost an immune response to the immunogen, e.g., in vaccine applications. The VLPs provide a robust platform for the presentation of essentially any immunogen of interest, by including an immunogen binding domain in the VLP and decorating the resulting recombinant VLP with a corresponding immunogen that is bound by the binding domain. The corresponding immunogen can be the immunogen of interest, or the corresponding immunogen can itself be a recombinant fusion of two or more moieties, e.g., an anchoring domain that is bound by the recombinant VLP and an additional domain that includes an immunogen target of interest. Multivalent immunogenic compositions are also contemplated, in which one or more VLP(s) in a vaccine composition is/are decorated with a plurality of different immunogens. The immunogens can include different domains of interest, e.g., in conjunction with a common anchoring domain that is bound by the recombinant VLPs. These domains of interest can include, e.g., toxin proteins such as anthrax toxin, ricin toxin, botulinum toxin, or essentially any other immunogen of interest.",
                        "In one specific example, a VLP of the T=3 insect nodavirus Flock House virus (FHV) was produced that displays 180 copies of the von Willebrand A (VWA)-domain of capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG-2) (also known as ANTRX2 protein) on the surface of the VLP. ANTRX2 is a receptor for anthrax toxin and the VWA-domain represents the binding site for protective antigen (PA). In this illustrative example, we replaced amino acids 265-267 of the FHV coat protein with 181 amino acids representing residues 38-218 of ANTRX2. These sites (in FHV or other similar nodaviruses) can be used for the insertion of other antitoxin/immunogen binding domains of interest.",
                        "The modified coat protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells and Trichoplusia ni cells using a recombinant baculovirus vector. The protein spontaneously assembled into VLPs that packaged random RNA. Electron cryomicroscopy and three dimensional image reconstruction of purified VLPs confirmed that the VWA domains are displayed on the surface of the VLPs. Computational modeling suggested that approximately 120 monomers of anthrax PA can bind to each particle. Steric crowding in this particular application prevents occupation of all 180 VWA domains.",
                        "Purified VWA VLPs functioned as a potent antitoxin in cell culture and protected rats from lethal anthrax toxin challenge. In addition, VLPs decorated with PA induced a robust antibody response against PA in rats, even in the absence of adjuvant. The response was significantly stronger than that induced against monomeric PA in control rats. Rats vaccinated with VLP-PA complexes were completely protected from intravenous challenge with anthrax lethal toxin whereas control rats that were vaccinated with monomeric PA did not survive.",
                        "FHV (or other nodavirus) VLPs displaying the VWA-domain of ANTRX2 show anthrax antitoxin activity in vivo and may therefore be useful as an effective therapeutic for the treatment of infected individuals that do not respond to antibiotic treatment (or as an adjunct to antibiotic treatment).",
                        "Further, in the case of anthrax, there are no antitoxins previously available for use in treatment. The ease of synthesis and purification of VLPs as described herein, the in vitro and in vivo stability and the multivalent display of the VWA domain represent advantages even relative to the potential use of soluble ANTRX2 as an antitoxin.",
                        "Additionally, FHV-VWA VLPs decorated with PA serve as an excellent immunogen to raise a potent antibody response to PA. This response is superior to monomeric rPA that is currently in commercial development as an anthrax vaccine. The use of VLPs decorated with PA reduces the number of immunizations required to achieve protection, which is a concern with the current rPA vaccine. Thus, such complexes serve as a novel and highly effective anthrax vaccine. Similar uses of VLPs to display other immunogens of interest should also result in a potent immune response; thus, the present invention, as well as providing an effective anthrax vaccine, also provides a general platform for vaccine development and production. As noted, for convenience, the immunogens of interest that are used to decorate the VLP can include a common anchoring domain that is bound by the VLP, in conjunction with essentially any immunogen of interest.",
                        "FHV-VWA VLPs decorated with PA can be used as a vaccine against anthrax. The polyvalent display of PA in the context of the virus particle leads to induction of a very strong antibody response, even in the absence of adjuvant, when compared to monomeric PA. In addition, the immunogen is molecularly well-defined and characterized, in contrast to the anthrax vaccine that is currently in use. Another advantage pertains to the fact that subjects are protected from lethal toxin challenge after only two injections with immunogen. This is a significant improvement compared to the lengthy immunization schedule with the currently available vaccine. Finally, using PA complexed to ANTRX2 as an antigen can lead to induction of antibodies that crosslink PA to ANTRX2. Such antibodies may be particularly useful in conferring protection against anthrax infection. The PA-ANTRX2 interaction also inhibits PA from binding to cells in vivo, thus minimizing the possibility that, during postexposure immunization, a PA immunogen could participate in intoxication.",
                        "Similar effects for VLPs that are decorated with one or more additional immunogens are expected; accordingly, the invention provides a universal platform for vaccine development and production."

The resulting VLPs are antitoxins against the toxin, e.g., in a human or veterinary patient, reducing a toxic effect of the toxin. In one preferred embodiment, coat protein of the nodavirus Flock House Virus (FHV) is used for the multivalent display of the Von Willebrand A (VWA) domain of capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG-2; also known as ANTRX2), a primary receptor for anthrax toxin. Sites for the insertion of the VWA domain in the coat protein were selected based on analysis of the high-resolution crystal structure of FHV. The resulting chimeric virus-like-particles (VLPs) can be generated in a baculovirus system and have been shown to protect both cultured cells and live animals from toxic effects of anthrax protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (anthrax toxin), indicating that the chimeric VWA domain binds PA, acting as a molecular decoy for anthrax toxin.",

(2006) \u201cViral and bacterial diseases of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, their prophylaxis and treatment: a review,\u201d Dis Aquat Organ. 71 (3):239-54). The Nodaviridae have bipartite RNA genomes comprising two separate single-stranded RNA molecules, designated RNA1 and RNA2. In the natural viral life cycle, RNA1 and RNA2 are both packaged within the same virion. RNA1 encodes an RNA replicase, and RNA2 encodes a capsid protein. In one representative example, Flock House Virus (FHV), RNA1 is 3.1 kb long and RNA2 is 1.4 kb.",
                                "Accordingly, flock house virus (FHV) is a bipartite, positive-strand RNA insect nodavirus that encapsidates its two genomic RNAs (RNA1 and RNA2) in a single virion in a manner similar to other nodaviruses, such as Black Beetle virus (BBV), Boolarra virus (BoV), Gypsy moth virus (GMV), and Manawatu virus (MwV). FHV provides one preferred nodavirus for modification according to the invention, although one of skill is able to use other nodaviruses in a similar manner. Nodamura virus is another useful example (see also, Am. J. Epidemiol. 86 (2), 271-285) as is Pariacoto virus (see also, J. Virol. 74 (11):5123-5132).",

The crystal structure of FHV has been determined, and other nodaviruses can be deduced by comparison to solved FHV structures or general crystallographic or other available virus structure determination methods. Nodaviruses such as FHV have surface loop domains into which a polypeptide of interest can be inserted for VLP display. As discussed in detail in the examples herein, preferred sites for insertion include two surface-exposed loops at approximately amino acid positions that correspond to 206 and 264 of FHV. In the examples herein, these sites are shown to accommodate a 181 amino acid ANTXR2 VWA domain without disrupting coat protein assembly into virus-like particles (VLPs) (FIG. 1a). In FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera 206, the VWA domain and a C-terminal two amino acid linker (Ala-Glu) replaced FHV coat protein residues 207-208 (FIG. 1b). In FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera 264, the VWA domain replaced FHV residues 265-267. General regions that can be manipulated for insertion include Loop L1 (corresponding to amino acids 195-219 (including, e.g., 201-213) of FHV coat protein), Loop L2 (corresponding to amino acids 263-277 of FHV coat protein), Loop L3 (corresponding to amino acids including e.g., 124-142 of FHV coat protein), Loop I1 (corresponding to amino acids 107-110 of FHV coat protein), Loop 12 (corresponding to amino acids 152-165 of FHV coat protein), and Loop 13 (corresponding to amino acids 304-310 of FHV coat protein).",

A thorough discussion of techniques relevant to bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes and cell culture generally is found in references enumerated herein and are briefly outlined as follows. Several well-known methods of introducing target nucleic acids into bacterial cells are available, any of which may be used in the present invention. These include: fusion of the recipient cells with bacterial protoplasts containing the DNA, treatment of the cells with liposomes containing the DNA, electroporation, projectile bombardment (biolistics), carbon fiber delivery, and infection with viral vectors (discussed further, below), etc. Bacterial or, e.g., insect cells can be used to amplify the number of plasmids containing DNA constructs of this invention. The cells are grown to log phase and the plasmids within the cells can be isolated by a variety of methods known in the art (see, for instance, Sambrook). In addition, a plethora of kits are commercially available for the purification of plasmids from bacteria.

The isolated and purified plasmids are then further manipulated to produce other plasmids, used to transfect other cells or incorporated into organism specific vectors to infect cells of interest. Typical vectors contain transcription and translation terminators, transcription and translation initiation sequences, and promoters useful for regulation of the expression of the particular target nucleic acid. The vectors optionally comprise generic expression cassettes containing at least one independent terminator sequence, sequences permitting replication of the cassette in eukaryotes, or prokaryotes, or both, (e.g., shuttle vectors) and selection markers for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.

                                "In one convenient aspect, recombinant nodavirus capsid protein can be expressed to produce VLPs in cells using a baculovirus expression system. The Baculoviridae infect many species of insects. Bacculoviridae have strong promoters and a well-characterized genome that make them suitable as expression vectors in insect cells. For example, the most common invertebrate expression vector system is based on the Autographa Californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), an insect baculovirus isolated from the Alfalfa looper. This virus replicates in the nucleus of many different lepidopteran insect cell lines. The baculovirus expression vector system is commonly used to express genes derived from other viruses (e.g., as in the present invention), as well as from fungi, bacteria, plants, and animals. In this system, foreign genes placed under the control of the strong polyhedrin promoter of the AcNPV are expressed at high levels in cultured lepidopteran (and many other) insect cells. In addition, Baculovirus have shown the ability to be used as vectors for a variety of mammalian cell lines. The most widely used lepidopteran cells for Baculovirus expression systems are the Sf9 and Sf21 cell lines isolated from ovarian tissue of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda, and the High Five cell line, designated BTITn-5B1-4, originally established from Trichoplusia ni embryonic tissue. A variety of additional details regarding Baculovirus expression systems can be found on the internet at bacculovirus(dot)com and at expressionsystems(dot)com, and in Baculovirus Expression Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol 39) Christopher D. Richardson (Editor); (1998) Humana Pr; ISBN: 0896032728; O'Reilly et al., Baculovirus Expression Vectors A Laboratory Manual, 1994 Oxford University Press, and The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide by Linda A.

For a description of baculovirus expression of nodavirus proteins, See, for example, Schneemann et al. (1993) \u201cUse of recombinant baculoviruses in synthesis of morphologically distinct virus-like particles of flock house virus, a nodavirus.\u201d J. Virol. 67, 2756-2763; O'Reilly et al.

                                "As discussed above, one feature of the invention is the insertion of heterologous coding sequences into the RNA2 gene of a nodavirus at sites that do not interfere with capsid assembly. For example, in FHV, relevant sites for insertion of heterologous sequences include amino acid residues 207-208 and 265-267 of the FHV coat protein.",
                                "The choice of which heterologous sequence to incorporate into the coat protein depends on the application. In general, recombinant VLPs that comprise heterologous polypeptide sequences can be used either as a molecular decoy (antitoxin) or as a vaccine platform for binding and presenting an immunogen.",
                                "When used as a molecular decoy, the VLP can include any of a variety of anti-toxin moieties. For example, when the primary manifestations of a disease are caused by a microbial toxin, a corresponding antitoxin, if administered in time, can have a pronounced prophylactic or curative effect. Common bacterial toxins include botulism toxin, diphtheria toxin, anthrax toxin, tetanus toxin and many others. Anti-toxin components that can be incorporated into the VLPs of the invention bind these toxins in a patient, preventing their usual mode of action in the patient. For example, as detailed in the examples herein, two anthrax toxin receptors, widely distributed on human cells, have been identified: anthrax toxin receptor/tumor endothelial marker 8 (ANTXR1)7 and capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (ANTXR2)8. Although both receptors bind anthrax PA through a 200 amino acid extracellular von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, the VWA domain of ANTXR2 has a 1000-fold higher binding affinity for PA than the VWA domain of ANTXR1. Thus, VLPs comprising many copies (for FHV, 180 copies, or one per capsid protein of the VLP), of the VWA domain of ANTXR2 acts as a potent anthrax antitoxin.",
                                "While this example serves to illustrate the invention, the example is not limiting. The specific interactions between a variety of toxins and host receptors are known and can similarly be used to select appropriate anti-toxin moieties for incorporation into VLPs. The major symptoms associated, e.g., with disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae (diphtheria), Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), Vibrio cholerae (cholera), Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Clostridium botulinum (botulism), Clostridium tetani (tetanus), and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome) are toxin mediated, and the toxins and modes of action for these diseases are all known (for additional examples, see, e.g., drlera(dot)com/bacterial_diseases/protein_toxins(dot)htm#table on the world wide web). For example, diptheria toxin binds to the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor HB-EGF receptor on susceptible cells and enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see textbookofbacteriology(dot)net/diphtheria(dot)html). By incorporating the ditheria toxin binding site of the HB-EGF receptor into a VLP of the invention, e.g., at the sites noted in the examples herein relating to anthrax applications, an antitoxin against diptheria toxin is provided. Similarly, botulism toxin (botulinum toxin) binds irreversibly to receptors on unmyelinated presynaptic membranes. This binding is mediated by a Carboxy (C) terminal of botulinum toxin heavy chain (in its native state, this heavy chain is associated with a light chain). Gangliosides with more than one neuraminic (sialic) acid, e.g. GT1b bind to the toxin. By incorporating glycoprotein components that comprise gangliosides into the VLP, a botulinum antitoxin is produced. Such glycoproteins have been produced, see e.g., Hashimoto et al. (1998) \u201cA Streptavidin-Based Neoglycoprotein Carrying More Than 140 GT1b Oligosaccharides: Quantitative Estimation of the Binding Specificity of Murine Sialoadhesin Expressed on CHO Cells\u201d J.

The resulting immunogen decorated VLPs can be used as vaccines against the relevant immunogen. As described in the examples herein, the heterologous domain can be one that binds to the relevant immunogen directly, e.g., the VWA domain of ANTXR2, which binds Anthrax PA.",
                                "However, any high affinity interaction between a polypeptide domain and a binding partner can be utilized, e.g., by recombinantly or chemically coupling the binding partner (as an \u201cadaptor\u201d or \u201clinker\u201d) to the immunogen, and then binding the resulting immunogen fusion to a VLP that binds the immunogen fusion. A large number of such cognate binding partners are known in the art and can be adapted to the practice of the present invention by being incorporated as VLP domains/immunogen fusion elements. For examples of binding partners, see, e.g.: Nilsson et al. (1997) \u201cAffinity fusion strategies for detection, purification, and immobilization of recombinant proteins\u201d Protein Expression and Purification 11: 1-16; and Terpe et al. (2003) \u201cOverview of tag protein fusions: From molecular and biochemical fundamentals to commercial systems\u201d Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 60:523-533, and references therein). Tags that can be used to couple the VLP to the immunogen include, but are not limited to, a polyhistidine tag (e.g., a His-6, His-8, or His-10 tag) that binds divalent cations (e.g., Ni2+), a biotin moiety (e.g., on an in vivo biotinylated polypeptide sequence of the VLP or immunogen) that binds avidin (present in the immunogen or VLP), a GST (glutathione S-transferase) sequence that binds glutathione, an S tag that binds S protein, an antigen that binds an antibody or domain or fragment thereof (including, e.g., T7, myc, FLAG, and B tags that bind corresponding antibodies), a FLASH Tag (a high affinity tag that couples to specific arsenic based moieties), a toxin receptor or receptor domain that binds to the toxin, protein A or a derivative thereof (e.g., Z) that binds IgG, maltose-binding protein (MBP) that binds amylose, an albumin-binding protein that binds albumin, a chitin binding domain that binds chitin, a calmodulin binding peptide that binds calmodulin, a cellulose binding domain that binds cellulose, etc. Another exemplary coupling partner that can be used to couple the VLP to the immunogen is a SNAP-tag. The SNAP-tag is an approximately 20 kDa version of a protein O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase which has a single reactive cysteine with a very high affinity for guanines alkylated at the O6-position.",
                                "Generally speaking, the invention optionally includes the use of such universal \u201cadaptor\u201d or \u201clinker\u201d domains in the immunogen of interest to facilitate binding to a VLP. As noted, a variety of immunogens and their binding domains are known. Once a recombinant VLP is produced that includes a binding domain of interest, this becomes a useful platform for coupling one or more different immunogens to the VLP. Thus, the VLPs herein that include the VWA domain of ANTXR2, which binds Anthrax PA can be used as a general vaccine platform for the delivery of essentially any immunogen of interest. That is, an immunogen of interest is fused to the portion of PA that is bound by a VWA domain (see Example 2 herein for details). The PA adaptor/linker binds the immunogen of interest to the VLP. Such immunogens of interest include any of those noted herein, including ricin toxin and botulinum toxin.",
                                "This approach is also useful for making multivalent vaccine compositions, e.g., by binding one or more VLP to one or more immunogen through a universal adaptor/linker that recognizes the VLP. Thus, a plurality of immunogen fusions that include an adaptor domain and an immunogen domain of interest can be bound to one or more VLP and then administered as a multivalent vaccine.",
                                "In any case, a recombinant VLP that can bind the immunogen of interest can, typically, bind many copies of the immunogen. This is because the VLP can be made up of, e.g., 180 copies of the capsid protein, with each copy comprising an immunogen binding sequence. The precise number of immunogens that can decorate the VLP will vary, depending on the steric properties of the immunogen. For example, the VLP will typically be able to bind 10 or more copies, generally 50 or more copies, often 100 or more copies, and sometimes up to 120 or more copies, and occasionally up to about 180 copies. In the case of anthrax PA binding to a VWA-VLP, described extensively herein, up to about 120 copies of PA can bind to the VLP.",
                                "The immunogen and the recombinant VLP can be co-expressed in a single cell, or the recombinant VLP and immunogen can be separately expressed. All references described regarding recombinant production and expression of VLPs apply equally to expression and production of the immunogens. Methods of isolating VLPs are described above. Typical biomolecule purification methods can similarly be used to isolate recombinant immunogen, which can then be used to decorate purified recombinant VLPs. For example, protein isolation methods for isolating polypeptide-based immunogens are available, e.g., those set forth in the references noted above in the context of VLP isolation.",
                                "Any of the examples above relating to VLPs comprising heterologous domains can also equally relate to decoration of the VLP. That is, common bacterial toxins to be used to decorate the VLPs can include anthrax toxin, botulism toxin, diphtheria toxin, tetanus toxin and many others. These can be coupled to the VLP either by binding to their respective antitoxin (incorporated into the VLP as noted above), or, e.g., by coupling through a standard heterologous binding partner interaction as noted herein.",
                                "The VLPs of the invention can display essentially any immunogen of interest, including immunogens that are not necessarily toxins. For example, VLPs can incorporate (or can be decorated with) relevant vaccine components related to significant vaccine targets such as bubonic plague. In this example, Yersinia pestis is the Gram-negative bacterium of the family Enterobacteriaceae responsible for bubonic plague (including the \u201cblack death\u201d, likely caused by Yersinia pestis biovar Medievalis). See, e.g., Camiel and Hinnebusch (eds.) (2004) Yersinia: Molecular and Cellular Biology Horizon Bioscience, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, USA; Collins F M (1996). \u201cPasteurella, Yersinia, and Francisella.\u201d In: Barron's Medical Microbiology (Barron S et al, eds.), 4th ed.

Pathogenicity of Yersinia pestis is mediated by two anti-phagocytic antigens, known as F1 and VW, both of which are important for virulence. Collins F M (1996), above. Immunity (natural or induced) is achieved by the production of antibodies against F1 and VW antigens; antibodies against F1 and VW induce phagocytosis by neutrophils. Salyers and Whitt (2002). Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach, 2nd ed., ASM Press. 207-12.",
                                "The F1 antigen is one preferred vaccine target. F1 is an outer membrane capsular protein of Y. pestis. The immunogenicity of whole F1 and of various peptide sequences, e.g, predicted to possess B (three sequences, B1, B2 and B3) and T (two sequences, T1 and T2) cell determinants have been studied, as have chimeras made between B and T structures. See, e.g., Sabhnani (2003) \u201cDeveloping subunit immunogens using B and T cell epitopes and their constructs derived from the F1 antigen of Yersinia pestis using novel delivery vehicles.\u201d FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 38 (3):215-29; Grosfeld et al. (2003) \u201cEffective Protective Immunity to Yersinia pestis Infection Conferred by DNA Vaccine Coding for Derivatives of the F1 Capsular Antigen\u201d Infect Immun. 71 (1): 374-383. Virulent and potentially virulent cells of Yersinia pestis produce virulence or V and W antigens (VW(+)); these antigens are also preferred vaccine targets for VLP decoration. For example, antibodies against V protein protect against Yersinia pestis infection and can be used to decorate VLPs of the invention. See also, e.g., Pullen et al. (1998) \u201cAnalysis of the Yersinia pestis V Protein for the Presence of Linear Antibody Epitopes\u201d Infect Immun. 66 (2): 521-527.

                                "Accordingly, in one embodiment of the invention, VLPs are decorated with F1 and/or V protein, or subsequences thereof, using any of the approaches already noted for binding the F1 and/or V proteins or peptide subsequences thereof to the VLP. F1 and/or V proteins, or portions thereof (e.g., for F1, B1, B2, B3 and/or T1 and/or T2), can also be recombinantly incorporated into the VLPs of the invention, at one or more of the loop sites noted herein. In either case, the resulting VLPs are used as an immunogen to raise protective antibodies against F1 and/or V protein. VLPs as Anthrax Vaccines",
                                "In one particularly preferred aspect, VLPs of the invention are decorated with anthrax toxin components (typically PA, or polypeptide sequences derived from PA). Multivalent display of the ANTXR2 VWA domain on the surface of the icosahedral insect nodavirus FHV VLP was shown to induce a potent immune response against LeTx when coated with PA. This immune response was neutralizing in vitro and protected animals against LeTx challenge following a single administration without adjuvant.",
                                "While the examples below refer to particular ANTRX2 receptor polypeptides and PA sequences, one of skill will recognize that the invention equally encompasses allelic variants of particular sequences. Further, the present invention is not limited to these particular examples. Recombinant VLPs can, for example, include larger segments of the ANTRX2 receptor polypeptide than the VWA sequence, and can also include, e.g., purification components (e.g., VLP purification tags that include any of the binding partners noted above). In addition, conservative variations of the ANTRX2 receptor polypeptide (or VWA component thereof) can readily be substituted. Preferably, any such conservative substitutions of the VWA domain will still be bound by the relevant immunogen, e.g., a PA domain (or conservative variant thereof) will preferably bind to the relevant recombinant VLP. This can be tested for in a routine VLP-immunogen binding assay, e.g., as taught in the examples herein.",

                                "One of skill will appreciate that many conservative variations of the nucleic acid constructs that are disclosed yield a functionally identical construct. For example, owing to the degeneracy of the genetic code, \u201csilent substitutions\u201d (i.e., substitutions in a nucleic acid sequence that do not result in an alteration in an encoded polypeptide) are an implied feature of every nucleic acid sequence that encodes an amino acid. Similarly, \u201cconservative amino acid substitutions,\u201d in one or a few amino acids in an amino acid sequence are substituted with different amino acids with highly similar properties, are also readily identified as being highly similar to a disclosed construct. Such conservative variations of each relevant sequence are a feature of the present invention. Further details regarding sequence variations and methods of mutagenesis are found below."

                        "The term \u201canthrax toxin\u201d refers to any component or product of the anthrax toxin. That is, the toxic effects of anthrax are predominantly due to an AB-type toxin made up of a single receptor-binding B subunit and two enzymatic A subunits. The A subunits are edema factor (EF, 89 kD), an adenylate cyclase that raises intracellular cAMP levels, and lethal factor (LF, 90 kD), a zinc protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. The receptor binding B subunit is protective antigen (PA), which is initially synthesized as an 83 kD precursor. Upon receptor binding, PA83 is cleaved by furin into a 63 kD product, which forms heptamers that bind EF to form edema toxin (EdTx) and LF to form lethal toxin (LeTx). Any or all of these are encompassed by the term \u201canthrax toxin.\u201d In addition, molecules derived from a wild-type anthrax toxin, e.g., through mutagenesis or recombinant methods, are also included within the term.",

Both the 83 kD precursor and the 63 kD furin cleavage product are optionally included within the term, as is the heptameric form thereof.

Thus, if the selected protein is aligned for maximum homology with the FHV capsid protein, the position in the aligned selected protein that aligns with FHV capsid residue is said to correspond to it. Instead of a primary sequence alignment, a three dimensional structural alignment can also be used, e.g., where the structure of the selected protein is aligned for maximum correspondence with the FHV capsid protein and the overall structures compared.

                                "The recent use of Bacillus anthracis as a bioweapon has stimulated the search for novel antitoxins and vaccines that act rapidly and with minimal adverse effects. B. anthracis produces an AB-type toxin composed of the receptor-binding moiety protective antigen (PA) and the enzymatic moieties edema factor and lethal factor. PA is a key target for both antitoxin and vaccine development. We used the icosahedral insect virus Flock House virus as a platform to display 180 copies of the high affinity, PA-binding von Willebrand A (VWA) domain of the ANTXR2 cellular receptor. The chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) correctly displayed the receptor VWA domain on their surface and inhibited lethal toxin action in in vitro and in vivo models of anthrax intoxication. Moreover, VLPs complexed with PA elicited a potent toxin-neutralizing antibody response that protected rats from anthrax lethal toxin challenge after a single immunization without adjuvant. This recombinant VLP platform represents a novel and highly effective dually-acting reagent for treatment and protection against anthrax.",
                                "To develop a reagent that functions both as an anthrax antitoxin and as a molecular scaffold for an efficient anthrax vaccine, we took advantage of an icosahedral virus platform that permits polyvalent display of the extracellular VWA domain of ANTXR2. This platform is based on Flock House virus (FHV), a non-enveloped, icosahedral (T=3) insect virus of the family nodaviridae [16]. The FHV capsid is composed of 180 subunits of a single type of coat protein, and the icosahedral, solid shell encapsidates a bipartite, single-stranded RNA genome. The crystal structure of FHV particles shows that the coat protein contains several surface-exposed loops that can be targeted for insertion of foreign proteins and peptides [17]. Here we report the synthesis and structural characterization of FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimeric particles and provide evidence for their efficacy as an anthrax toxin inhibitor in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we used the chimeric particles as a scaffold for the multivalent display of PA and show that this complex functions as a potent vaccine against LeTx.",

                                "The VWA domain of ANTXR2 forms a compact structure that adopts a Rossmann-like \u03b1/\u03b2-fold with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif that is involved in PA binding [9,18]. The N and C termini of this domain, residues C39 and C218, respectively, are closely juxtaposed thereby permitting, in principle, genetic insertion into a loop on a carrier protein. Modeling studies of the FHV coat protein subunit indicated that two surface-exposed loops at amino acid positions 206 and 264 would accommodate the 181 amino acid ANTXR2VWA domain without disrupting coat protein assembly into virus-like particles (VLPs) (FIG. 1A). Based on these predictions, two chimeric proteins were generated. In FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera 206, the VWA domain and a C-terminal two amino acid linker (Ala-Glu) replaced FHV coat protein residues 207-208 (FIG. 1B). In FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera 264, the VWA domain replaced FHV residues 265-267. The chimeric proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells using recombinant baculovirus vectors. In this system, wildtype (wt) FHV coat protein forms VLPs whose high resolution structure is virtually indistinguishable from that of native virions. However, VLPs contain random cellular RNA instead of the FHV genome and are therefore not infectious [19].",
                                "Putative chimeric VLPs were purified from the cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation and material sedimenting at a position similar to that observed for native virions was harvested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in FIG. 1C, both samples contained a major protein and a slower migrating minor protein of the appropriate molecular weights (\u224863 kD, the combined molecular weight of the 43 kD FHV coat protein and the 20 kD ANTXR2 VWA domain). Since the FHV coat protein undergoes a spontaneous cleavage reaction after assembly of particles (FIG. 1B) [20], the minor protein likely represented the unprocessed precursor protein, whereas the major protein represented the post-assembly cleavage product. Capsid proteins representing chimera 264 migrated more slowly through the gel than those representing chimera 206, even though the amino acid composition of the two polypeptides was virtually identical. The reason for this differential behavior is not known but could reflect subtle differences in denaturation of the proteins under SDS-PAGE conditions.",
                                "Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples confirmed the presence of VLPs in the gradient-purified material (FIG. 1D). Compared to the smooth exterior of native FHV virions, the surface of the chimeric particles was rough and distinct protrusions were visible. The appearance of the particles suggested that they were filled with RNA, as stain did not penetrate the interior. This conclusion was supported by the sedimentation rate of the VLPs, which was indistinguishable from that of wt FHV.",
                                "**Structural Analysis of FHV-VWAANTXR2 VLPS.**",
                                "Electron cryomicroscopy and image reconstruction of the FHV-VWAANTXR2 VLPs showed that, compared to wt FHV particles (FIG. 5C), both chimeric particles displayed additional density at higher radius (FIGS. 5A and 5B), in agreement with the protrusions that were visible in negatively stained samples (FIG. 1D). To define the arrangement of the VWA domains on the surface of the chimeric particles, pseudoatomic models were generated by fitting the X-ray coordinates of the FHV coat protein subunit and the ANTXR2 VWA domain into the cryoEM density maps (FIGS. 3A and 3B; 6A and 6B). The models revealed that in chimera 206 the VWA domains were closely juxtaposed at the quasi three-fold axes. Two of the three VWA domains in each asymmetric unit closely interacted with their twofold related counterparts, thereby creating an offset cluster of six domains. In contrast, the insertion site chosen for chimera 264 allowed for wider spacing and more even distribution of the individual VWA domains on the particle surface.",
                                "To investigate the accessibility of PA to the VWA domains, PA83 was computationally docked onto the VWA domains of the pseudoatomic models of chimeras 264 and 206 using the X-ray structure of PA63 complexed with the ANTXR2 VWA domain as a guide [9,18]. It was evident that chimera 264 could accommodate significantly more PA molecules than chimera 206 given the wider spacing of the VWA domains on this particle (FIGS. 3C and 3D; 7A and 7B). Specifically, each subunit at the fivefold axes and three of the six subunits around the quasi-sixfold axes could bind PA83 without steric interference, giving a total occupancy of 120 PA molecules per particle. In contrast, due to the close juxtaposition of the VWA domains on chimera 206, a maximum occupancy of 60 PA molecules per particle was predicted. These predictions were in close agreement with results from biochemical analyses of complexes formed between the particles and PA83 under saturating conditions. Specifically, gel electrophoresis combined with densitometric analysis showed that chimera 206 could bind an average of 90 PA83 ligands, whereas chimera 264 bound an average of 130 PA83 ligands (FIGS. 8A and 4B). Together, these results were consistent with the observation that a higher concentration of chimera 206 was required to protect cells from intoxication with PA/LFN-DTA (FIG. 2).",
                                "FHV-VWAANTXR2 VLPS Protect Cultured Cells from Intoxication",
                                "The soluble, monomeric ANTXR2 VWA domain (sANTXR2), expressed and purified from mammalian cells, was previously shown to effectively block entry of lethal toxin into susceptible cells by competing with cellular ANTXR2 for binding to PA [10]. PA has a very high binding affinity for sANTXR2 (Kd=170 pM) and dissociates extremely slowly from this receptor decoy (half-life of the complex is approximately 17 hours) [21]. We used the same approach to test the inhibitory activity of FHV-VWAANTXR2 VLPs. Namely, the assay employed CHO-K1 cells and a modified form of lethal toxin, PA/LFN-DTA, in which the N terminal portion of LF was fused to the catalytic portion of diphtheria toxin A-chain [22]. This recombinant toxin efficiently kills CHO-K1 cells within 48 hours and uses the same PA-dependent entry mechanism as wt LF. The assay revealed that chimera 264 protected cells as efficiently as sANTXR2, whereas a higher concentration of chimera 206 was required to achieve protection of the cells (FIG. 2). The corresponding IC50 values for sANTXR2 and chimera 264 were 19.70\u00b10.87 nM and 18.50\u00b10.36 nM, respectively, while the IC50 was 32.71\u00b10.61 nM for chimera 206. Thus, chimera 264 performed as well as the highly potent, monomeric sANTXR2 inhibitor in this assay. To confirm the ability of the particles to neutralize native lethal toxin, a macrophage-based toxin neutralization assay was performed with chimera 264. The assay revealed that the particles protected RAW264.7 cells efficiently from a mixture of PA and wt lethal toxin and the measured IC50 was 39.8+2.2 nM.",

                                "We next tested whether the chimeric particles were capable of protecting rats against lethal toxin challenge as was demonstrated previously for sANTXR2 [10]. In vivo experiments were only performed with chimera 264 because it had shown higher potency in the cell intoxication assay (FIG. 2). As a positive control, sANTXR2 was used in parallel. Male Fisher 344 rats were inoculated intravenously with 5 minimal lethal doses (MLD) of LeTx either in the presence or absence of chimera 264 or sANTXR2 as previously described [10]. As shown in Table 1, both chimera 264 and sANTXR2 completely protected the animals when used at a molar ratio of 2:1 (ANTXR2:PA). Moreover, the animals did not exhibit any symptoms of intoxication such as agitation, respiratory distress or hypoxia. Injection vehicle (PBS) or wt FHV, used as a negative control, had no protective effect. While neither chimera 264 nor sANTXR2 were able to protect rats when used at a tenfold lower concentration (molar ratio of ANTXR2:PA=0.2:1), they each caused a delay in the time to death compared to the lethal toxin control (Table 1). The delay was notably longer for chimera 264 (89 min) than sANTXR2 (77 min) and the difference was highly significant (p=0.0046) suggesting increased therapeutic potency of the multivalent particles over monomeric sANTXR2 as an inhibitor of the anthrax toxin. It will be interesting to determine whether different pharmacokinetic profiles are observed in vivo for sANTXR2 and chimera 264.",
                                "PBS vehicle of injection as negative control, lethal toxin (20 \u03bcg (240 pmol) of protective antigen (PA) and 8 \u03bcg (89 pmol) of lethal factor (LF), FHV wt was injected at a concentration of 21 \u03bcg/rat (480 pmol).",
                                "**Computational Models of PA Bound to FHV-VWAANTXR2 Particles.**",
                                "Results from the cell intoxication assays and LeTx challenge experiments in rats suggested that the chimeric particles could bind PA, which in turn indicated that the inserted VWA domains were correctly folded in the context of the FHV particle. The differential behavior of FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimeras 206 and 264 in cell intoxication assays, however, potentially reflected differences in the accessibility of PA to the VWA domains on the surface of the particles. To further investigate this, PA63, the proteolytically activated form of PA, was computationally docked onto the VWA domains of the pseudoatomic models of chimeras 264 and 206 using the X-ray structure of PA63 complexed with the ANTXR2 VWA domain as a guide9,17. It was evident that chimera 264 could accommodate significantly more PA molecules than chimera 206 given the wider spacing of the VWA domains on this particle (compare FIGS. 3c and d). Specifically, each subunit at the fivefold axes and three of the six subunits around the quasi-sixfold axes could bind PA63 without steric interference, giving a total occupancy of 120 PA molecules per particle. In contrast, due to the close juxtaposition of the VWA domains on chimera 206, a maximum occupancy of 60 PA molecules per particle was predicted. These results were consistent with the observation that a twofold higher concentration of chimera 206 was required to protect cells from intoxication with PA/LFN-DTA (FIG. 4). Assuming an occupancy of up to 120 of the 180 VWA domains on chimera 264, the particles were, however, more potent on a molar basis than sANTXR2. This enhancement could have been the result of polyvalent effects which are known to enhance the biological activity of peptides and proteins relative to their monomeric state21.",

                                "The observation that FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera 264 functioned as a binding surface for multiple copies of PA suggested that a complex of the two components might constitute an effective antigen for induction of PA-specific antibodies. To test this, complexes were prepared by mixing chimera 264 with an excess of PA83 and unbound PA83 was removed by ultracentrifugation. Electron microscopic analysis showed that PA83 formed thin protrusions emanating from the capsid surface.",
                                "For immunogenicity studies, rats (4/group) received two s.c. injections (0 and 3 weeks) of either 2.5 \u03bcg PA83, 5.4 \u03bcg of particle-PA complex (molar equivalent of 2.5 \u03bcg PA83 assuming an occupancy of 120 VWA domains), or 2.9 \u03bcg of chimera 264. No adjuvants were employed in these experiments. ELISA assay of pre- and post-inoculation sera showed that animals immunized with the complex had significantly higher levels of anti-PA antibody than animals receiving PA alone both at week 3 (p=0.0028 compared to PA alone) and after boosting (week 7; p=0.0118 compared to PA alone) (FIG. 4A). No significant antibody response against ANTXR2 VWA was detected in these animals, but a response against FHV protein was observed after the boost in rats that were immunized with the complex (FIGS. 4B and C). Why animals immunized with chimera 264 alone did not mount a similar immune response against FHV protein is not clear. The presence of PA may somehow enhance the response to FHV or may influence the localization or interaction of FHV particles with antigen-presenting cells causing a difference in the observed anti-FHV antibody titer.",
                                "To test whether the anti-PA antibodies were protective against anthrax toxin, the rats were challenged by intravenous inoculation with 10 MLDs of LeTx. All animals that had been immunized with the particle-PA complex survived, whereas all but one of the animals in the PA83 group died (FIG. 4D). Survival versus death correlated well with the level of anti-PA antibody detected in the sera. However, the animal in the PA-only group that survived LeTx challenge had a serologic response to PA that was well below that of a non-surviving animal in the same group (FIG. 4D).",
                                "Based on the observation that animals immunized with the particle-PA complex showed a significant level of anti-PA antibody as early as 3 weeks after the first immunization (FIG. 4A), we investigated whether animals could be protected against LeTx after a single injection. Rats (5/group) were immunized once with increased doses of the particle-PA complex (10.8 \u03bcg), PA83 (5 \u03bcg), or chimera 264 (5.8 \u03bcg) as a control. After 3 weeks the animals were bled and challenged one week later with 10 MLDs of LeTx. All rats that were immunized with the particle-PA complex survived, whereas all other animals died (FIG. 4F). Of those that died, one animal had a serologic antibody response to PA that was greater than that of two animals in the group of survivors (FIGS. 4E and 4F) indicating that the magnitude of the antibody response is not a reliable predictor of protection. Serial dilution assay showed that the average reciprocal anti-PA titer in animals immunized with the particle-PA complex was 3240, and in vitro LeTx neutralization assays confirmed the neutralizing activity of these antibodies (ED50:54). Taken together our results show that multivalent display of PA on the FHV-VWAANTXR2 scaffold yields a significant advantage over monovalent, soluble PA as an immunogen for anthrax toxin.",
                                "In this example we have provided and developed a novel reagent that combines the functions of anthrax antitoxin and vaccine in a single compound. It is based on multivalent display of the ANTXR2 VWA domain on the surface of the icosahedral, insect nodavirus FHV. We demonstrated that the recombinant VLPs protect cultured cells and rats from anthrax intoxication as efficiently as the highly potent sANTXR2 receptor decoy and that they induced a potent immune response against LeTx when coated with PA. This immune response was neutralizing in vitro and protected animals against LeTx challenge following a single administration without adjuvant.",
                                "The immunogenicity studies showed that polyvalent display of PA induces a more potent immune response than monomeric, recombinant PA (rPA), which is currently being developed as a second-generation anthrax vaccine [15,23]. Ordered arrays of antigens permit particularly efficient cross-linking of B cell receptors which in turn leads to faster and more robust B cell proliferation [24,25,26]. Given the exceptionally tight binding of PA to ANTXR2 under natural conditions (Kd=170 pM) [21] it is reasonable that complexes formed between chimera 264 and PA are sufficiently stable to serve as an immunogen in vivo. Results from in vitro cell intoxication experiments support this, showing that the complexes were stable for at least 40 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. Naturally occurring PA neutralizing antibodies do not bind to the receptor-binding surface of PA [27]. PA immobilized on these particles should be able to elicit a protective immune response. Indeed, rats survived lethal toxin challenge four weeks after a single injection of the VLP-PA complex, whereas animals injected with an equivalent amount of rPA died. This result suggested rapid production of neutralizing antibodies in the absence of adjuvant, two key goals for the development of third generation anthrax vaccines. No significant antibody response to ANTXR2 was observed, presumably because there are only 2 amino acid differences between human ANTXR2 displayed on the particle and endogenous rat ANTXR2 [11].",
                                "It will be useful to characterize the neutralizing antibody response in individual animals after primary and secondary immunization. It will also be of interest to determine the mechanism by which toxin neutralization occurs. For example, there is a slight difference in antibody response after primary and secondary immunization and a wide range of antibody titers between individual animals (FIG. 4). It will be of interest to establish whether these differences correlate with epitope specificity or are based on other immunologic parameters. In addition, it is interesting to compare the findings in this example to those obtained with a B. anthracis spore-challenge model.",
                                "Because the chimeric particles are expressed from an mRNA that contains only the coding sequence of the modified FHV coat protein while all other FHV sequences are missing, the resulting virus-like particles are not infectious and thus cannot replicate in mammalian tissues [19]. Even native FHV particles are unable to initiate infection in mammals as they do not carry the FHV receptor and because FHV cannot replicate at temperatures above 31\u00b0 C. [28]. We have also demonstrated previously that FHV VLPs expressed from baculovirus vectors in Sf21 cells do not contain baculoviral or cellular DNA [19], thus ruling out potential integration of foreign DNA into mammalian genomes. Based on these properties, the chimeric particles can be expected to have a desirable safety profile for applications in animals and humans.",
                                "While the potency of the nanoparticles herein as a vaccine is most likely due to polyvalent display of PA, polyvalency is less of a factor in the function of the particles as an antitoxin, given the extremely high affinity between PA and ANTXR2. Moreover, since PA binds as a monomer to the particles, little, if any polyvalent effect is to be expected. In fact, we detected no significant difference in IC50 when comparing nanoparticles with soluble ANTXR2 in cell intoxication assays. However, the use of polyvalency to increase the affinity between a ligand and its target receptor is a useful general strategy [31]. Recently, Rai et al. [32] reported that \u201cpattern matching\u201d is a useful parameter for polyvalency to reach its maximum potential.",
                                "In vivo potency of viral nanoparticles is also determined in part by their pharmacokinetic parameters. Such parameters have recently been reported for viral nanoparticles derived from the plant virus cowpea mosaic virus [33]. It will be useful to determine any differences in plasma clearance kinetics and biodistribution of soluble ANTXR2 versus ANTXR2-containing nanoparticles.",
                                "The VWA domain of ANTXR2 was a candidate for insertion into a loop of the FHV coat protein because the N and C termini are only separated by 4.8 \u212b in the native structure [34]. In addition, this domain adopts a compact Rossmann-like \u03b1/\u03b2-fold that can evidently form independently within the context of a larger protein while not interfering with accurate folding of the carrier protein. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that the high-resolution structure of the VWA domain could be fitted easily into the cryoEM density maps. To our knowledge, Hepatitis B virus is the only other virus for which icosahedral surface display of an entire protein in its biologically active conformation has been demonstrated. In that case, genetic insertion of the green fluorescent protein in a surface-exposed loop of the core protein resulted in efficient formation of fluorescent HBV capsids [35].",
                                "In principle it should be possible to expand the use of the FHV platform to display additional anthrax antigens either in the presence or absence of the ANTXR2 VWA domain. Specifically, direct insertion of peptides or entire domains derived from PA, LF and EF is feasible as long as the termini of the domains are in close enough proximity for insertion into the FHV coat protein loops. It is also possible that the two insertion sites at positions 206 and 264 could be used in combination to create particles with multiple functionalities. This could greatly enhance the protection afforded by the resulting particles.",
                                "Numerous other strategies are being pursued to develop improved anthrax vaccines, including PA-expressing Salmonella [36] and B. subtilis [37], adenovirus encoding PA domain 4 [38], rabies virus encoding GP-PA fusion protein [39] and bacteriophage T4 particles decorated with PA-hoc fusion proteins [40,41,42]. None of these, however, combine the function of vaccine and antitoxin as in the present invention. In those cases where immunized animals were challenged with LeTx or anthrax spores, only the adenovirus construct provided complete protection after a single immunization [38]. One strategy involves non-covalent surface display of intact proteins and protein complexes on bacteriophage T4 particles. The prolate lattice of the T4 capsid permits efficient surface presentation of anthrax toxin through in vitro addition of Hoc- and/or Soc protein fusions with PA, LF, or EF to hoc\u2212soc\u2212 phage either separately or in combination [40,42]. Mice immunized with phage displaying PA, EF and LF generated high levels of neutralizing antibodies [41] but results from toxin or spore challenge experiments have not yet been reported.",
                                "In summary, we have developed a reagent that serves a dual purpose in combating B. anthracis infection. It functions as a competitive inhibitor of anthrax toxin in vivo suggesting that it could be useful as a therapeutic compound, particularly in combination with standard antibiotic therapy. In addition, when complexed with PA, it has significant advantages as an immunogen compared to monomeric PA and thus forms the basis for development of an improved anthrax vaccine.",

DNA fragments encoding FHV coat protein-ANTXR2 VWA domain chimeras were generated by overlap extension PCR using Pfu polymerase [43]. Three DNA fragments containing the nucleotide sequence for the N-terminal portion of the coat protein, the ANTXR2 VWA domain (GenBank accession no. AY23345, nts 115-657, amino acids 38-218) and the C-terminal portion of the coat protein, were initially generated. The template used for generating segments containing the FHV coat protein sequence was plasmid pBacPAK9RNA2\u25a1[44], which contains the full-length cDNA of FHV RNA2 in baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK9 (BD Biosciences). The template used for generating the segment containing the ANTXR2 VWA coding sequence was a derivative of plasmid PEGFP-N1 [8]. Following overlap extension PCR, the full-length product was digested with BamH1 and XbaI, gel-purified and ligated into equally digested pBacPAK9. The transfer vector was amplified in E. coli strain DH5\u03b1, purified and sequenced to confirm the presence of the ANTXR2 VWA sequence and to ensure the absence of inadvertent mutations. Recombinant baculoviruses AcFHV-VWAANTXR2-264 and AcFHV-VWAANTXR2-206 were generated by transfecting Sf21 cells with a mixture of transfer vector and linearized Bsu36I-linearized BacPAK6 (BD Biosciences) baculovirus DNA as described previously [43].",

VLPs in the clarified supernatant were pelleted through a 4-ml 30% (wt/wt) sucrose cushion in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. by centrifugation in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor at 184,048\u00d7g for 2.5 h at 11\u00b0 C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5 and loaded onto a 10-40% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient in the same buffer. The gradients were spun in a Beckman SW 28 rotor for 3 h at 103,745\u00d7g. VLPs were collected from the gradient by inserting a needle below the VLP band and aspirating the material into a syringe. Alternatively, gradients were fractionated with continuous absorbance at 254 nm on an ISCO gradient fractionator at 0.75 ml/min and 0.5 min per fraction. Fractions containing VLPs were then dialyzed against 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5 and concentrated to 1-5 mg/ml using a centrifugal concentrator with a 100,000 MW cut off (Amicon, Millipore). The final protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce Chemicals) and purity was evaluated by densitometry (Fluor Che\u2122SP, Alpha Innotech) after electrophoresis on a 10% Bis-Tris gel stained with Simply Blue (Invitrogen).",

The grids were washed and blotted with filter paper three times by floating on droplets of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. Each grid was then treated three times with a drop of 1% uranyl acetate solution and left in the third drop for 1-2 min prior to blotting and air drying.

                                "Electron cryomicroscopy and image reconstruction. Frozen-hydrated samples were prepared using standard methods [46]. In brief, an aliquot of the sample was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil holey carbon-coated grid (2/4 Cu\u2014Rh), blotted with filter paper, and rapidly plunged into liquid ethane. Low-dose electron micrographs of FHV-VWAANTXR2-264 VLPs were recorded onto Kodak SO163 film at a magnification of 45,000\u00d7 on a Philips/FEI CM120 transmission electron microscope. For FHV-VWAANTXR2-206 VLPs, low-dose micrographs were recorded on a CCD camera at a magnification of 50,000\u00d7 on a Philips/FEI Tecnai20 transmission electron microscope. The grids were maintained at \u2212180\u00b0 C. using a Gatan 626 cryo-stage. Micrographs with minimal astigmatism and drift, as assessed by visual inspection and optical diffraction, were digitized with a Zeiss microdensitometer (Z/I Imaging) giving a step-size of 3.1 \u212b on the specimen. Images recorded on the CCD camera had a step-size of 2.26 \u212b. Particle images were extracted with the program X3D[47] and were processed by polar Fourier transform methods using the program PFT[48]. A previously calculated model of wt FHV [49] was used as the starting model. Initial refinement cycles were restricted to the radii spanning the FHV capsid and then relaxed to incorporate the extra domains. Using a Fourier shell correlation cut-off value of 0.5, the FHV-VWAANTXR2-206 and FHV-VWAANTXR2-264 maps were refined to resolutions of 25 and 23 \u212b, respectively.",
                                "Generation of pseudoatomic models. The atomic coordinates of the FHV coat protein subunit and the VWA domain of ANTXR2 (PDB ID: 1SHT) were used to generate a pseudoatomic model of the FHV-VWAANTXR2-206/264 virus-like particles. Specifically, the models were created with the program O [50] by visually positioning the ANTXR2 VWA domains at the surface of the FHV structure and adjusting for overlap. The models were then further refined against the structure factor amplitudes derived from the cryo-EM density using the program CNS [51]. Individual subunits and domains of the FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera were allowed to move independently as rigid bodies and subjected to five rounds of 20 cycles of rigid body refinement. Protective antigen 83 (PA83) molecules were docked onto the resulting FHV-VWAANTXR2-206/264 models using the structure of PA63 complexed with the ANTXR2 VWA domain (PDB-ID: 1T6B) as a guide [9]. Once all 180 ANTXR2 VWA domains on the FHV-VWAANTXR2 chimera were populated with PA83 molecules, a minimal number of PA molecules were selectively removed to relieve steric clashes with neighboring PA molecules.",

                                "An attractive feature of the VNI platform is that, through the use of chimeric proteins with PA fused to other immunogens, it should be possible to use this as a versatile technology to generate rapidly acting and effective vaccines against other pathogens and their products. These other pathogens include category A, B, and C agents, some of which represent major bioterrorism threats. For example, there have been several recent advances in the development of mucosal vaccines against ricin and botulinum neurotoxins. However, in each case effective immunization involves multiple dosings with the immunogen (22-24).",
                                "As shown in FIG. 9, the current example includes using the VNI platform to present multiple immunogens to the immune system. The strategy, in this example, is to fuse PA with antigenic portions of ricin or botulinum toxins (e.g. PA-R and PA-B, respectively). These fusion proteins are then multivalently arrayed on the surface of VNIs to generate combination vaccines.",
                                "The VNI-multivalent vaccine approach can circumvent the need for multiple dosings of immunogen, giving rise to a more rapid and efficient response. Moreover, by combining PA fusion proteins with the C-terminal domains of multiple BoNT serotypes (e.g. A, B, and E), it should be possible to use the VNI approach toward development of multivalent BoNT vaccines. This approach can be used to generate combination vaccines, which can simultaneously provide protection against, e.g., anthrax, botulinum A toxin (BoNT/A), and ricin toxin. In particular, by fusing immunogenic portions of other toxins such as ricin toxin or botulinum toxin with PA, the VNI platform is used to immunize against multiple toxins simultaneously (FIG. 9).",
                                "Use of the VNI platform to develop combination vaccines for additional pathogens. Here the ability to generate a combination VNI-based vaccine is discussed. Fusion proteins of PA and ricin toxin or botulinum A toxin are generated and arrayed on the surface of VNIs (FIG. 10). Immunization and challenge studies can be used to monitor immunity simultaneously generated against the toxins.",
                                "Generating an oligomerization- and cleavage-defective PA mutant. In this example, the use of the multivalent VNI platform employs altered versions of PA in which domain 1, also known as PA20, is replaced with moieties from botulinum neurotoxin A and ricin A chain. To ensure that these heterologous moieties remain stably associated with PA and are not proteolytically removed by furin, a mutant version of PA is used in which the furin cleavage site is replaced with the amino acids SNKE. This mutation was previously shown to inhibit furin cleavage of PA (32). In addition, to ensure that the PA fusion proteins do not spontaneously heptamerize (a process normally inhibited in-cis by domain 1), an Asp to Lys mutation is introduced at position 512. This amino acid alteration inhibits PA heptamerization without compromising overall structure or receptor binding of PA (33). The mutations are engineered into wt PA using standard molecular cloning procedures. A cDNA of wt PA is currently available in the E. coli expression vector pET22b. The PA containing modifications at the furin cleavage site and at residue 512 are used throughout the example.",

Standard molecular cloning procedures are employed to replace the coding sequence of domain 1 (amino acids 1-167) in PA with that of ricin toxin A chain (RTA), to generate the PA-R fusion protein. A His-tag is added to the N terminus of RTA to facilitate purification of PA-R. The PA-R fusion construct is expressed in E. coli using vector pET22b. Protocols that closely follow those currently used for expression of wt PA are employed. The fusion protein is purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel column and, if necessary, by FPLC using ion exchange or gel filtration chromatography. Purified protein is aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.",

In addition, an N terminal His tag is added to the BoNT(A) moiety to facilitate purification of the fusion protein. The PA-B fusion construct is expressed in E. coli using standard procedures that closely follow those currently used for expression of wt PA.

To this end, purified PA-R is added to a cell-free lysate and inhibition of protein synthesis will be measured. Specifically, PA-R will be added to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 35S-methionine and mRNA, and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. Purified RTA chain (Vector Laboratories) is used as a positive control. Negative control samples do not receive toxin. Protein is precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and the amount of radioactivity incorporated is determined by liquid scintillation counting. Correct folding of the BoNT(A) domain is confirmed by immunoprecipitation with a conformation-specific antibody. Specifically, monoclonal antibody CR1 (34) is employed. This antibody was shown to bind with high affinity to a discontinuous epitope comprised of loops located in both the HCN and HCC domains. Incorrectly folded BoNT(A) HC domain is highly unlikely to bind to CR1. Alternatively, correct folding of BoNT(A) can be verified by confirming its function as a competitive inhibitor in the botulinum neurotoxin neutralization assay.",

Mutation Y80A prevents local vascular leakage in vaccinated individuals and mutation V76M inactivates the enzymatic activity of RTA. This double mutant of RTA was shown to be safe and immunogenic in mice and rabbits (36). Groups of 5-10 mice receive two subcutaneous injections of VNI-PA-R complex on day 0 and 21 following a protocol analogous to that described for vaccination of rats with VNI-PA. Adjuvants are not employed in these experiments. Serum samples are collected prior to priming as well as before and after boosting. Control animals are injected with VNI alone, vehicle alone, or RTA alone. Serum anti-RTA and anti-PA antibody levels and their toxin neutralization capacity are determined. One week after the boost (day 28) mice are challenged with an i.p. injection of 100 ng/g mouse of ricin (Inland Laboratories). This dose corresponds to 10-fold the LD50 of ricin. Weights and death of the animals are monitored daily for 10 days. If animals survive ricin challenge, the experiment id repeated but mice are challenged 3-4 weeks after a single injection.

ELISA to measure anti-PA, anti-ANTXR2 and anti-FHV are done as described previously. To measure the anti-RTA response, 96-well plates are coated overnight with RTA (Vector Laboratories), blocked and incubated with serial dilutions of antiserum.

The IgG antibodies raised in mice immunized subcutaneously with VNI particles coated with the PA fusion protein(s) are screened by cell culture-based toxin neutralization assays (TNAs) for their abilities to neutralize anthrax lethal toxin, ricin, or BoNT(A). The anthrax lethal toxin TNA is described above. The ricin TNA involves incubating serial dilutions of antiserum and ricin holotoxin (Inland Laboratories) prior to their addition to Vero cells. Cell survival is subsequently monitored using the MTT proliferation assay kit from the ATCC (37).",

Taken together these studies can be used to determine whether VNI particles coated with recombinant PA-R and PA-B fusion proteins can invoke the production of neutralizing antibodies against more than one toxin component. Moreover, by immunizing mice with a cocktail of VNI-PA, VNI-PA-R, and VNI-PA-B particles, or with VNI particles coated with different ratios of all 3 forms of the PA protein, it should be possible to generally vaccinate against these biowarfare agents.",

Therefore, they will be characterized to define the step of anthrax lethal toxin, ricin, and BoNT(A) intoxication which is the target for the neutralizing responses. The studies involving anthrax lethal toxin will be conducted as described above. The studies involving BoNT(A) employ the previously described immunofluorescence microscopy approach involving fixed Neuro-2A cells to discriminate between those antibodies which block toxin binding to cells from those that block toxin uptake (38). Similarly, immunofluorescence microscopy is used to monitor the effects of neutralizing antibodies on ricin uptake into cells via endocytosis followed by retrograde transport to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum prior to translocation to the cytosol, as described previously (39). Antibodies specific for ricin, for the endosomal marker EEA1, for the Golgi marker TGN46, and for the endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP are employed for these studies.",
