## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

- introduce bipolar disorder study
- describe patient recruitment and diagnostic assessments
- outline CSF sampling and storage procedures
- detail metabolomic analysis of CSF samples
- present results of metabolomic analysis
- identify significantly altered metabolites
- perform multivariate logistic regression analysis
- evaluate association between metabolites and BD
- investigate effect of clinical data and medication on isocitrate levels
- conclude that CSF isocitrate levels are higher in BD patients

### Example 2

- describe serum metabolomics analysis

### Example 3

- evaluate combinatorial use of markers in CSF and serum samples

### Example 4
