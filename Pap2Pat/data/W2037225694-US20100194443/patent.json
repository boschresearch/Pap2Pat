A representative AGC circuit employs an exponential V/I converter in the feedback loop that controls the gain of a variable-gain amplifier (VGA). The exponential characteristic of the V/I converter enables the AGC circuit to advantageously have a substantially constant settling time for a variety of initial input-signal conditions, which is very desirable for the above-specified applications. Additional details on the use of exponential V/I converters in AGC circuits can be found, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,618, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",

More specifically, unlike bipolar transistors, which have an inherent exponential transfer characteristic, MOSFET transistors have a square-law transfer characteristic in strong inversion. As a result, designing a CMOS V/I converter that exhibits an exponential transfer characteristic and has other desirable properties is relatively difficult."
