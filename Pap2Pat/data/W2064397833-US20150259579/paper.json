    "abstract": "Common adhesives stick to a wide range of materials immediately after they are applied to the surfaces. To prevent indiscriminate sticking, smart adhesive materials that adhere to a specific target surface only under particular conditions are desired. Here we report a polymer hydrogel modified with both \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2CD) and 2,2'-bipyridyl (bpy) moieties (\u03b2CD-bpy gel) as a functional adhesive material responding to metal ions as chemical stimuli. The adhesive property of \u03b2CD-bpy gel based on interfacial molecular recognition is expressed by complexation of metal ions to bpy that controlled dissociation of supramolecular cross-linking of \u03b2CD-bpy. Moreover, adhesion of \u03b2CD-bpy gel exhibits selectivity on the kinds of metal ions, depending on the efficiency of metal-bpy complexes in cross-linking. Transduction of two independent chemical signals (metal ions and host-guest interactions) is achieved in this adhesion system, which leads to the development of highly orthogonal macroscopic joining of multiple objects.",

The feed ratio of the monomers used in the preparation was optimized as follows to realize suitable supramolecular cross-linking and hardness of the gel (Supplementary Table 1): AAm: 92\u2009mol%, \u03b2CDAAm: 3\u2009mol%, bpyAAm: 3\u2009mol%, MBAAm 2\u2009mol%. \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was characterized by 1H solid-state field-gradient magic angle-spinning (FG-MAS) NMR measurements (Fig. 2a). The signals for both \u03b2CD and bpy moieties were observed, which confirmed the introduction of both groups into the acrylamide polymer gel scaffold. From integral ratios of the signals, the mol% contents were determined to be 2.2 and 3.0 mol% for \u03b2CD and bpy moieties, respectively. These values were also supported by elemental analysis (Methods). As reference materials, \u03b2CD gel, bpy gel and AAm gel were also prepared according to the same procedure with \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel (Fig. 2b)."

The inclusion was also confirmed by using their acrylamide derivatives, \u03b2CDAAm and bpyAAm (Supplementary Fig. 3). Although bpyAAm was almost insoluble in D2O at room temperature, addition of 1 eq. of \u03b2CDAAm (10\u2009mM) dissolved 10% of bpyAAm through the formation of inclusion complexes \u03b2CDAAm\u2013bpyAAm. These data show that bpy can be included in the \u03b2CD\u2019s cavity, and that it acts as an inhibitor to \u03b2CD as a host.",
                        "Supramolecular cross-linking of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy in \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was investigated. Figure 2c showed the swelling ratios Q (= (the weight of a swollen gel)/(the weight of the corresponding dried gel) of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel and its reference gels in DMSO and H2O, respectively. After replacing the solvent from DMSO to H2O, \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was largely contracted (Q=25.1 and=6.7 for DMSO and H2O, respectively) compared with the other gels. This contraction is explained by an increase in crosslink density on the formation of the inclusion complex \u03b2CD\u2013bpy in the polymer network. To demonstrate supramolecular cross-linking in \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel, the size change of the gel on treatment with organic molecules that disrupt the formation of the host\u2013guest complex was investigated (Fig. 2d,e). After immersing in a 10-mM aqueous solution of \u03b2CD (a competitive host) or 1-admantanecarboxylic acid sodium salt (AdCANa, a competitive guest), \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was swollen up to 110\u00b12 or 161\u00b15% (length ratio), respectively. The expansion of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was larger than that of the other gels, except in the case of bpy gel immersed in \u03b2CD solution, which can be explained by change in polymer\u2019s hydrophilicity caused from \u03b2CD\u2019s encapsulation of hydrophobic bpy side chain. These observations indicate that the supramolecular cross-linking \u03b2CD\u2013bpy that had existed in \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was dissociated by appropriate external stimuli, which caused the gel to swell."

                        "As efficient formation of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy units in \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was demonstrated, the reaction of metal ions with the \u03b2CD\u2013bpy inclusion complex was investigated. As a model experiment to obtain detailed information about the reaction, the effect of Zn2+ ion on a \u03b2CD\u2013bpy inclusion complex was examined by 1H NMR measurements in D2O solution (Supplementary Fig. 4). On the addition of Zn2+, bpy reacted with Zn2+ and was released from \u03b2CD, which made the cavity of \u03b2CD free. Subsequent removal of Zn2+ from bpy with a strong metal chelator, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt (EDTA\u00b74Na), regenerated the inclusion complex \u03b2CD\u2013bpy. It was demonstrated that inclusion and release of bpy with \u03b2CD were reversibly controlled by the presence of the metal ion (Fig. 1b).",
                        "The reaction of metal ions with \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was investigated by immersing the gel in corresponding metal chloride salt aqueous solutions (Fig. 3). The gel changed its properties reflecting chemical characteristics of different metal\u2013bpy complexes. Figure 3a shows appearance change of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel observed by microscopy after immersing the gel in CuCl2 or FeCl2 aqueous solution. After treatment with Cu2+, the gel became highly swollen up to ca. 300% in length. In the case of Fe2+, the gel was modestly expanded (ca. 120%) and its colour turned from colourless to red. The red colour is attributed to tris(bpy) complex [Fe(bpy)3]2+ with metal-to-ligand charge transfer absorption. Figure 3b shows the length change of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel after treatment with various metal chloride salt solutions. About three equivalents of metal ions were added against the bpy moieties in the gel. The swelling behaviour was very different depending on the type of metal ions. The largest expansion was observed when reacted with Cu2+ (310\u00b120%), while treatment with Fe2+ did not largely expand the gel (120\u00b11%), and the gel was almost the same in length in the case of Mg2+ (96.3\u00b10.3%). Hardness of the gel was also changed on reaction with metal ions. Figure 3c shows data for tensile strength measurements of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel before and after treatment with metal ions. The tensile modulus of the \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel was 7.2\u00b10.4\u2009kPa, and it was decreased after the reaction with Cu2+ (3.0\u00b10.2 kPa). Meanwhile, the tensile modulus was highly increased after the reaction with Fe2+ (88\u00b11 kPa).",
                        "This selectivity is well explained by the difference in metal-to-ligand ratio of the resulting metal\u2013bpy complexes and their efficiency in cross-linking (Fig. 3d; See also Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2 for the equilibrium between metal\u2013bpy complexes of each element). First, the complexation constant of Mg2+ and 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl is negligible, and that of Mn2+ and bpy is relatively small (log \u03b23=5.9; ref. 44). These metal ions only slightly interact with the polymer framework of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel and thus its size change was small. Second, metal ions such as Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ mainly form mono(bpy) complex [M(bpy)Xx]n+ (X=Cl\u2212 or H2O) when the amount of metal ions is larger than that of bpy (Supplementary Fig. 5)44. Thus, the metal ions dissociated the inclusion complex \u03b2CD\u2013bpy into mono(bpy) metal complex and free \u03b2CD, which decreased in the number of cross-link points. This decross-linking together with an increased swelling pressure brought about by positive charges of metal\u2013bpy complexes made \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel to largely expand and become soft. And thirdly, Fe2+ ion mainly forms the tris(bpy) complex [Fe(bpy)3]2+ even when the excess amount of Fe2+ ions against bpy is present in the system (Supplementary Fig. 5)44. Thus, the reaction of Fe2+ to \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel replaced the cross-links of the inclusion complex \u03b2CD\u2013bpy with those of the tris(bpy) complex [Fe(bpy)3]2+. This tris(bpy) complex working as three-way junction in the gel network45 counteracted the increasing swelling pressure caused by positive charges and contributed to the stiffness of the gel. To summarize, \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel behaved as an environmentally responsive material that altered its property based on the characteristics of the metal ions as chemical stimuli."

Here, tBu gels was selected as a subject material to adhere as a model for chemically selective adhesion (Fig. 1a)13. It was expected that \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel (\u2018metal\u2013ion-responsive host gel\u2019) adhered to tBu gel (\u2018guest gel\u2019) via the formation of inclusion complexes \u03b2CD\u2013tBu on the interface of the gels. tBu gels (x) were prepared by radical copolymerization of AAm, N-tert-butylacrylamide (tBuAAm) and MBAAm in DMSO and used as hydrogels by replacing the solvent with water. Here, x represents the mol% content of N-tBuAAm in feed on the preparation of the gel. Inclusion of tBu group within the cavity of \u03b2CD was tested in a model experiment in aqueous solution, and its binding strength was comparable to that of bpy groups (binding constant Ka of tBuAAm to \u03b2CD: 1.0 \u00d7 102 M\u20131 (D2O, 298\u2009K), (Supplementary Figs 6,7)).",
                        "The adhesion between \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel and tBu gel (20), and the effect of metal ions on it were studied (Fig. 4a\u2013c). \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel did not adhere to tBu gel (20) in the absence of metal ions (Fig. 4b). This is because inclusion ability of \u03b2CD moieties was suppressed by efficient formation of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy cross-linking in the gel. However, after immersing a piece of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel in 100\u2009mM CuCl2 aqueous solution for 1\u2009min, it acquired the adhesion ability to that of tBu gel (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Movie 1). The adhesion was so strong that the piece of tBu gel was lifted up. It was suggested that Cu2+ ions dissociated \u03b2CD\u2013bpy units and generated free \u03b2CD that could engage in the formation of inclusion complex with tBu groups, and adhesion between the two gels was achieved via the interfacial linking by \u03b2CD\u2013tBu units (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the removal of Cu2+ from \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel by immersing in a 100\u2009mM aqueous solution of EDTA\u00b74Na as a metal ion chelator lost its adhesion ability, which means that reversible switching of adhesion properties in response to metal ions was achieved via control of dissociation and reformation of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy units in the gel."

                        "The adhesion property of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel showed metal ion selectivity. \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel immersed in 100\u2009mM FeCl2 aqueous solution did not adhere to tBu gel (Fig. 4c), which was in clear contrast to the case of CuCl2. Figure 4d shows results of tensile adhesion strength measurements between \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gels and tBu gels (10) immersed in various kinds of metal chloride salt solutions ([MCl2]=10\u2009mM (M2+=metal ion, 3 eq [/bpy]). The pieces of both gels were immersed for 3\u2009h to reach their equilibrium. See the Methods section for details). \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel treated with Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ exhibited adhesion ability to tBu gel (10), with the highest value (1020\u00b120 Pa) of Zn2+. In contrast, the gels treated with Mg2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ did not adhere to it. This selectivity on the kind of metal ions can be explained by the change in gel\u2019s physical property as discussed above (Fig. 3d). (1) Metal ions such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ that do not interact at all or only slightly interact with bpy groups had little or no effect on the cross-linking of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy units of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel, hence adhesion ability based on \u03b2CD\u2019s molecular recognition was kept suppressed. (2) Metal ions such as Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ that form mono(bpy) complex [M(bpy)Xx]n+ (X=Cl\u2212 or H2O) generated free \u03b2CD in the gel, which gave its adhesion property based on molecular recognition. In addition, decross-linking of network made the gel soft and raised the mobility of the \u03b2CD moiety on the polymer scaffold, which contributed the efficient formation of \u03b2CD\u2013tBu inclusion complexes on the interface. (3) Fe2+ ion, which mainly forms the tris(bpy) complex [Fe(bpy)3]2+, dissociated the inclusion complex \u03b2CD\u2013bpy into the tris(bpy) iron complex and the \u03b2CD with its cavity free. Although free \u03b2CD moieties were generated, the three-way cross-link by tris(bpy) complex made the gel harder over 10-fold (Fig. 3c) and decreased the mobility of \u03b2CD units, thus its adhesion ability was impaired.",
                        "The mechanism of the metal\u2013ion-responsive adhesion based on switching of molecular recognition was further supported by quantitative adhesion measurements. Figure 4e shows the results of tensile adhesion measurements between \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel/tBu gel (10) immersed in CuCl2 aqueous solutions with different concentrations. \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel did not exhibit its adhesion property without Cu2+ or with small amount of Cu2+. Meanwhile, the gel immersed in 0.1\u2009mM solution of CuCl2 (about 0.2 eq [/bpy]) showed weak adhesion (220\u00b130\u2009Pa) to tBu gel, which suggested that the inclusion complexes \u03b2CD\u2013bpy near the gel\u2019s surface were dissociated. The adhesion became stronger as the solution of CuCl2 was more concentrated, and the measured adhesion strength was as high as 1,000\u00b1200\u2009Pa when immersed in a 100-mM solution of CuCl2. Furthermore, treatment of \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel preimmersed in a 10-mM solution of CuCl2 with a 100-mM solution of EDTA\u00b74Na lost its adhesion ability to tBu gel. This data can be explained by the increase in the number of free \u03b2CD as the metal complexation reaction with bpy proceeded. Interfacial formation of \u03b2CD\u2013tBu between two gels was supported by quantitative tensile adhesion measurements using tBu gels (x) with different mol% contents of tBu groups (Fig. 4f)15. \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel immersed in CuCl2 solution did not adhere to the AAm gel without tBu groups, so there was no macroscopic attractive interaction between polyacrylamide scaffolds of the two gels. The figure shows that tBu gel (x) possessing more tBu groups gave a higher adhesion strength with \u03b2CD\u2013bpy gel (1200\u00b1100\u2009Pa for x=25), which suggested that adhesion strength is dependent on the number of inclusion complexes formed between the gels. The formation of inclusion complex \u03b2CD\u2013tBu on the interface was further supported by the experiments using tBuOH as competing guests for \u03b2CD (binding constant Ka of tBuOH to \u03b2CD: 4.8 \u00d7 10\u2009M\u20131 (H2O, 298\u2009K)46). The pieces of the two gels did not adhere to each other in the presence of tBuOH as an inhibitor in the immersing solution (1,000\u2009mM). These experiments demonstrated the importance of \u03b2CD\u2019s molecular recognition in the adhesion process."

This makes a clear departure from the mechanism of normal adhesive materials like glues. It is worth noting that chemically selective adhesion by molecular recognition was expressed by the kind of metal ion, which is also a chemical signal. In other words, transduction of two independent chemical signals was achieved in this adhesion system. Using the principle, highly orthogonal macroscopic joining of multiple objects can be created.",

Another example would be a smart reinforcement/masking material that detects metal ions leaked from containers or pipes, and sticks to the weaken part specifically. Furthermore, in combination with other stimuli response131415161718192021, medical applications such as nanogels for drug delivery systems4849 would be possible by making use of its selectivity and adhesion strength in wet conditions. We hope that the concept presented here, that is, chemically selective adhesives with chemical stimuli responsiveness, inspire creativity in various fields of science and engineering."
