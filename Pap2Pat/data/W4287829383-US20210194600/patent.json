                        "Implanted devices are electronic devices that are installed inside the body for medical purposes. They are designed to stay in the body for long periods up to few years in some applications. They can be used for treatment or diagnostic purposes. Heart pacemakers, insulin pumps, and neurostimulators are some examples of implanted medical devices. These devices are equipped with communication and networking functionalities that allow them to provide sophisticated features such as reporting measurements or alarms in real time or changing their settings or configuration without removing them from the body.",
                        "Currently, implanted devices communicate either percutaneously or wirelessly. In first mechanism, wires are run through the skin of the patient and connected to the implanted device from one side and the other side is connected to interface at the skin to allow external devices to be hooked to. Although this method provides fast, reliable, secure, low cost, low power consumption, its use is limited to testing and prototyping purposes because of two main problems. First, the interface creates openings in the skin that becomes subject to infections and disclose the use of an implanted device. Second, the wires restrict the movement of the patient.",
                        "On the other hand, wireless communication provides a convenient and invisible way of communication with implanted devices which make it used widely. Implanted devices can be equipped with active or passive components that realize the wireless communication link. The active components have active electronic circuits that requires a battery to power the device to transmit or receive a wireless signal. This forces designers to increase implanted size to accommodate a large battery that can work for years. In contrast, the passive components use induction from a device outside the body as a power source. Although they do not need a battery to run, they need to have large antennas and need to be placed near the skin to increase power transfer efficiency during the induction process. Therefore, it is not suitable for devices that should be implanted deeply inside the body. Since the active and passive methods use electromagnetic waves for signaling, they are vulnerable to security and privacy attacks due to interference and information leakage. Using specialized devices, malicious users could target those devices from a remote location to gain access, reconfigure, disable, or eavesdrop on them. There is a need for a safer yet efficient communication system to enable wireless communication with such devices."

                        "In this disclosure a Molecular Communication system in the Body (MoCoBo) and an alternative communication method called Molecular Signaling Method (MoSiMe) is described. In this system and method signaling molecules are used instead of electromagnetic waves to provide better privacy and security compared to existing systems. The signaling molecules are released in, and confined to, the body fluids which provide high security against eavesdropping, particularly when compared to electromagnetic waves. In addition, hijacking the communication link cannot take place without noticeable physical contact with the body which the patient would be aware of in most cases and thus be capable of preventing it. Moreover, unlike electromagnetic waves that are power hungry and risk harming body cells, this method is biocompatible and power efficient. We propose a novel system and method of communication using a new way of wireless signaling using molecules. The proposed communication method takes advantage of the bodily processes such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).",
                        "FIG. 1 is a diagram showing one configuration of molecular communication system in body 100 (MoCoBo) according to an embodiment of the present invention. The MoCoBo system 100 comprises a transmitter 101 or a set of transmitters in another embodiment, signaling molecules 102, a receiver 103 or a set of receivers in another embodiment, communication channel 104 which is a body of an organism with a circulatory system 105. In this example, the transmitter 101 is in the form of a pill that is taken orally. The transmitter 101 is configured to release signaling molecules 102 in a controlled manner to modulate information so that the receiver 103 can detect it and infer the encoded information. The body 104 of an organism with a circulatory system 105 is the communication channel that is used as the medium through which the signaling molecules travel from the transmitter 101 to the receiver 103. The body 104 and channel terms will be used interchangeably in the following text.",
                        "FIG. 2 is a diagram showing an example of the concentration profile over time of signaling molecules administered to the body. The signaling molecules FIG. 1 (102) distribution across the body is affected by body 104 processes such as absorption, distribution, metabolization and excretion (ADME). When signaling molecules are released into the body 104, the body ADME processes change the signaling molecules concentration over time which generates a signal across the body that can be detected at the receiver FIG. 1 (103). The signal amplitude changes in proportion to the concentration of signaling molecules in the body over time. The signal has two phases: the rising phase and falling phase. The rising phase starts after injecting signaling molecules into the body 104 as the concentration starts to increase with a rate proportional to how fast the signaling molecules get absorbed by the body and reach the systolic system in a bodily process known as absorption. As the signaling molecules enter the blood system, the distribution process start where the blood carries the signaling molecules and distribute them all over the body which leads to an increase in the signaling molecules concentration. However, the signaling molecules gets metabolized (i.e. broken down into other compounds) and excreted as they go through organs such as the liver, kidneys, and sweat glands. The concentration keeps increasing even though the metabolization and excretion processes reduce it because the absorption process happens at a faster rate. When the injection of signaling molecules into the body stops, the absorption rate reduce and the metabolization and excretion processes rate becomes higher. Therefore, the falling phase start and leads to a decline in the signaling molecules' concentration.",
                        "FIG. 3 is a process flow chart illustrating steps 300 of molecular signaling method (MoSiMe) according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method exploits the bodily ADME process to create a signal across the body by controlling the amount of signaling molecules released and the time of release. At step 301 the transmitter injects signaling molecules into the body. At step 302 The Absorption process starts moving signaling molecules into the body blood. Then, the distribution process starts when the blood carry signaling molecules and distribute them throughout the body at step 303. At step 305 the absorption and distribution processes cause the level of the signaling molecules concentration to increase over time casing the Rising Phase of MoSiMe as shown in FIG. 2. At step 306 the transmitter stops injecting signaling molecules into the body. At step 307 the bodily processes metabolization and excretion becomes faster than the absorption process. The metabolization which is mostly done in the liver and excretion which mostly done by the kidneys eliminate signaling molecules out of the body. Therefore, the metabolization and excretion processes lead to a decline in the signaling molecules concentration casing the Falling Phase of MoSiMe as shown in FIG. 2. Then, the signaling method process goes to step 301 if there are more signals to be sent. The transmitter controls the amount and release time of signaling molecules injection into the body to shape the MoSiMe signal in a way that the receiver will be able to detect and extract the encoded information within it. The amount of signaling molecules and release time are found by examining the ADME processes rates.",
                        "FIG. 4 is a diagram showing an example of a molecular signal (MS) modulating a stream of bits using two levels of concentration (C0 and C1) according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the transmitter wants to modulate a MS that encodes symbols that represents bits 0 and 1. To encode a zero, the transmitter injects signaling molecules till the concentration reaches C0 level, then stops for some time till the concentration level drops before it starts modulating another symbol. On the other hand, if the transmitter wants to encode a one, injects signaling molecules till the concentration reaches C1 level. For example, to modulate a stream of bits such as 001101110, the transmitter injects signaling molecules till the concentration reaches C0 to modulate a zero. After that it stops till the concentration level drops, then it resumes inject molecules till the concentration reaches C0 to modulate the second zero. After that it stops till the concentration level drops, then it resumes inject molecules till the concentration reaches C1 to modulate the first one. After that it stops till the concentration level drops, then it resumes inject molecules till the concentration reaches C1 to modulate the second one. The process continues till all the bits are modulated.",
                        "FIG. 5 is a diagram showing system-level model for molecular communication in body (MoCoBo) 500 according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the MoCoBo system 500 comprises a transmitter 101, a channel 104, and a receiver 103 like any traditional communication system. However, the MoCoBo system 500 differs in using the body 104 as the communication channel and employing a new molecular signaling method (MoSiMe) for information signaling which requires changes to the design of the traditional communication system components.",
                        "From the logical design point of view, the MoCoBo transmitter 101 components are similar to any traditional transmitter components that are known to a person skilled in the art. In this example, the transmitter 101 may comprise of an information source 510, a source encoder 511, a channel encoder 512, and a modulator 513. The information source 510 has a set of messages which the transmitter 101 wants to send to the receiver 103. The source encoder 511 takes a message and converts it to its binary representation and passes it to the channel encoder 512 where extra bits are added for error detection and correction. The channel encoder 512 passes the generated streams of bits to the modulator 513 which modulate them into the channel 104.",
                        "The channel 104 is the communication channel, such as but not limited to, the human body in this example but it could be a body of any organism that has a circulatory system. The channel 104 carries the signaling molecules FIG. 1 (102) from the transmitter's side to the receiver's side.",
                        "The receiver 103 can be, but not limited to, any implanted electronic device or a nanorobot, an artificial organism, biologically modified organism, or non biologically modified organism that responds to the transmitted signal that are known to a person skilled in the art. From the logical design point of view, the MoCoBo receiver 103 components are similar to any traditional receiver components that are known to a person skilled in the art. In this example, the MoCoBo receiver 103 may comprise of a demodulator 523, channel decoder 522, source decoder 521, and information sink 520.",
                        "In this example, the receiver 103 is assumed to be an implanted electronic medical device such as but not limited to, a pacemaker that may has a microcontroller, power source, and a bio sensor. The microcontroller detects signals received by the biosensor and estimates the channel symbols at the demodulator 523. Then, the receiver 103 runs the channel decoder 522 to detect and correct errors in the transmitted stream of bits. After that, the source decoder 521 predicts the message sent based on the estimated stream of bits and forwards it to the information sink 520.",
                        "FIG. 6 is a process flow chart illustrating steps 600 of an example method used by the transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. The user starts the transmitter at step 601 and enters a message in the transmitter using, but not limited to, an input device such as a keypad at step 602. In this example, the message could be a command that changes the running time to 3 hours and written as SR3h. Then, at step 603 the user selects transmitting the command and the transmitter takes the command and converts it to its equivalent binary stream which could be \u201c11101010011\u201d. At step 604, the transmitter uses a modulation scheme such as, but not limited to, the on off keying (OOK) to create a MoSiMe signal. At step 605, if the stream has more bits, a bit is read at step 606, otherwise, it moves to step 611 and ends the transmission. At step 607, if the bit is one go to step 609 and inject signaling molecules into the body by running a pump for \u03c41 seconds. Other alternative molecule injection mechanisms are possible and can be used which are apparent to a person skilled in the art. At step 610, the transmitter stops injecting signaling molecules, in this example, by means of stopping the pump for \u03c42 seconds before picking the second bit. On the other hand, if the bit is zero at step 607, the transmitter moves to step 608 and does not inject signaling molecules to the body, in this example, by keeping the pump off and waits for \u03c43 seconds, then, it moves to step 605. The process continues till all bits are transmitted where the transmitter moves from step 605 to 611 and ends the transmission. The values for \u03c41, \u03c42, and \u03c43 are selected based on the ADME process rates so that the receiver can detect molecular signal and infer the sent message. An example of a modulated input signal sent using the OOK is shown in FIG. 8.",
                        "FIG. 7 is a process flow chart illustrating steps 700 of an example method used by the receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention. Once the receiver start 701, it stays on and measures the concentration of the signaling molecules while switching between the sleep and wake up modes. The receiver enters the sleep mode 702 after starting and measures the concentration of the signaling molecules (C). At step 703, it checks if C is less than a predefined concentration level C_WakeUp, it goes to step 704 and sleeps for \u03c44 seconds before it returns to step 702 and takes another measurement. However, at step 703, if C is greater than C_WakeUp, it assumes that the transmitter is transmitting and moves to step 705 where it changes to wake up mode and measures the signaling molecules concertation. At step 706, if C is greater than a predefined concentration level C_Sleep, it goes to step 707 and waits for \u03c45 seconds. Then, it returns to step 705 and take another measurement of C. Ideally, \u03c45 should be much smaller than \u03c44 to enable the receiver to measure more frequently. In this example, the measured concentration values are stored to be processed later to infer the information send by the transmitter. At step 706, if C is less than C_Sleep, the receiver assumes that the transmitter has finished transmitting and moves to step 708. At step 708, the receiver stops measuring C and moves to step 709. At step 709, the receiver process sampled signal to retrieve information sent by the transmitter. Then, it returns to sleep mode at step 702. Examples of the received sampled signal curves are shown in FIG. 10.",
                        "One way of inferring the information sent by the transmitter is to do demodulation of the sampled signal using deconvolution. In deconvolution, the receiver deconvolutes the sampled signal with the pre-generated impulse response curves of the body such as the one shown in FIG. 9. The result of deconvolution generates an approximation to the signal modulated by the transmitter as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 which the receiver uses to detect symbols encoded within the signal and converts it to its equivalent binary bits and maps them to its equivalent message.",

To generate the impulse response experimentally, a dose of signaling molecules is designed to be an input signal which is created to resemble a delta signal that has infinite magnitude and zero width. To reduce the width of the signal, the dose is put very quickly in a one shot manner to generate the required impulse effect.
