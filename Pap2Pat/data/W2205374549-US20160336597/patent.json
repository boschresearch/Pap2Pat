                        "Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as energy storage devices for portable electronics, and may be candidates for use in grid-scale storage and hybrid or electric vehicles. In commercially available rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, graphic carbon is commonly used as an anode. Graphic carbon provides a capacity of about 370 mAh/g. However, commonly used cathode compounds, such as LiCoO2 and LiFePO4, can only provide a capacity of about 150-170 mAh/g, which is far from matching the capacity of the carbon anode. Thus, for a large-scale application of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries there may be a need for a two-fold improvement in energy and power densities, preferably while also keeping costs low. Metal fluoride (MFx)-based conversion compounds could have been suggested as they may accommodate more than one lithium per transition metal, leading to 2-4 times higher specific capacities than the currently common commercial cathodes (i.e. LiCoO2, LiFePO4). Among various MFx compounds under consideration, FeF2 and FeF3 are leading candidates due to their high cycling reversibility. However, these compounds have low working potential (\u02dc2.5 V), which may limit their applicability. Furthermore, CuF2 has been used as a high-voltage cathode in primary batteries, but may not be suitable in rechargeable batteries because of a low achievable capacity and poor reversibility.",

                        "Alternatively, metals in powder form may be dissolved in fluorosilicic acid in water solution (for example a 20-25 wt % solution) as partially described in Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 156 (6) A407-A416 (2009). The mixture may be heated at 40-45\u00b0 C. for several hours to allow the reaction of the metals with the fluorosilicic acid. After filtering any potential excess metal, the resulting solution may be dried under heat until forming a dry powder. The resulting powder may then be heat-treated at temperatures ranging from 150 to 300\u00b0 C. in argon to form pure M1yM21-yF2.",
                        "The resulting cathode active materials may consist of a single-phase solid solution (instead of a mixture of two phases) over the whole compositional range. This may be due to the structural similarity between metal mixtures chosen (see for example FIG. 1b). For example, the crystal structure of FeF2 is tetragonal rutile (space group: P42/mnm) and is comprised of FeF6 octahedra. CuF2 has a similar structure (monoclinic, space group: P21/n), which can be taken as a distorted rutile structure due to the strong Jahn-Teller distortion induced by the Cu2+ ([Ar]3d9) ion. The distorted structure of CuF2 becomes more symmetric with Fe incorporation to form the CuyFe1-yF2 solid solution.",
                        "The as-synthesized particles may be complex agglomerates of small nanocrystallites (<10 nm), (FIG. 1c). The diffusive ring pattern of electron diffraction (inset of FIG. 1c), despite its broadening arising from nanocrystalline nature of the particles, can be assigned to the tetragonal rutile phase (FIG. 1e). FIG. 1e shows the electron diffraction patterns of ball-milled Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 (left), FeF2 (right, upper), and CuF2 (right, lower). A ring pattern of each sample indicates the formation of nanoparticles. The diffraction pattern of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 resembles that of rutile FeF2 with no additional diffraction, which is identical to the XRD of FIG. 1a. Monoclinic CuF2 has a more complicated ring pattern due to less symmetric, monoclinic structure to tetragonal FeF2.",
                        "The cathode active materials may exhibit two-step lithiation behavior. For example, the reaction voltages of CuyFe1-yF2 are not identical to CuF2, FeF2, or mixture of CuF2 and FeF2, indicating the cooperative conversion of Cu and Fe that sit on the same lattice. Similar observations may also be seen in other solid-solution systems. In addition, compared to for example pure FeF2 the reaction kinetics in the 2nd stage (conversion of intermediate FeF2) may be improved, which may be indicated by elevated working potentials, and disappearance of the \u201cvalley\u201d at the early conversion of FeF2 (arising from sluggish conversion kinetics).",
                        "The cathode active materials may exhibit high cycling reversibility. For example, the voltage profile of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 for the 1st five cycles is given in FIG. 2a. The similarity of the voltage profiles between different cycles, especially after the 1st discharge (lithiation), indicates the high cycling reversibility. In certain embodiments, the cathode active material has a charge capacity of at least about 80%, 90%, or 93% of the initial discharge capacity. Furthermore, the cathode active material may have a voltage difference between charge and discharge of less than 0.5 V. This reversibility voltage difference may make the cathode active materials suitable for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.",

This may be due to the structural similarity between CuF2 and FeF2 (FIG. 1b). The crystal structure of FeF2 is tetragonal rutile (space group: P42/mnm) and is comprised of FeF6 octahedra. CuF2 has a similar structure (monoclinic, space group: P21/n), which can be taken as a distorted rutile structure due to the strong Jahn-Teller distortion induced by the Cu2+ ([Ar]3d9) ion. The distorted structure of CuF2 becomes more symmetric with Fe incorporation to form the CuyFe1-yF2 solid solution. The as-synthesized particles are complex agglomerates of small nanocrystallites (<10 nm), which is typical for ball-milled samples (FIG. 1c). The diffusive ring pattern of electron diffraction (inset of FIG. 1c), despite its broadening arising from nanocrystalline nature of the particles, can be assigned to the tetragonal rutile phase (FIG. 1e). FIG. 1e shows the electron diffraction patterns of ball-milled Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 (left), FeF2 (right, upper), and CuF2 (right, lower). Ring pattern of each sample indicates the formation of nanoparticles. The diffraction pattern of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 resembles that of rutile FeF2 with no additional diffraction, which is identical to the XRD of FIG. 1a. Monoclinic CuF2 has a more complicated ring pattern due to less symmetric, monoclinic structure to tetragonal FeF2.",
                                "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to predict the stability of all the possible solid solution phases. The energy difference between the possible CuyFe1-yF2 phases and the simple yCuF2-(1-y)FeF2 mixture (FIG. 1d) indicates that, regardless of the composition, there exist several CuyFe1-yF2 phases that are energetically more stable (negative energy points) than the simple mixture (zero energy points). The lowest energy points at each composition overlap well with the convex hull (dashed line), indicating that CuyFe1-yF2 can exhibit solid solution behavior over the entire composition range. The structural stability of the solid solution phases was also examined by in situ heating experiment, in which no phase separation was found in Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 with heating up to 250\u00b0 C.",
                                "Due to incorporation of Cu and Fe into the same lattice, the CuyFe1-yF2 system exhibits two-step lithiation behavior. The reaction voltages of CuyFe1-yF2 are not identical to CuF2, FeF2, or mixture of CuF2 and FeF2, indicating the cooperative conversion of Cu and Fe that sit on the same lattice. Similar observations were also reported in other solid-solution systems. In addition, compared to pure FeF2 the reaction kinetics in the 2nd stage (conversion of intermediate FeF2) was largely improved, which is indicated by elevated working potentials, and disappearance of the \u201cvalley\u201d at the early conversion of FeF2 (arising from sluggish conversion kinetics).",
                                "Lattice parameters of CuyFe1-yF2 were evaluated based on the CuF2-based monoclinic model as shown in FIG. 1g. The \u03b2 angle gradually increases with Fe content until it reaches 90\u00b0, indicating the structural change from the distorted monoclinic to symmetric tetragonal rutile at higher Fe concentrations. Unit cell volume and b/c lattice parameters (corresponding to a/b parameters in the FeF2-based tetragonal rutile) increase continuously at higher Fe content due to differences in ionic size of Fe2+ (92 pm) and Cu2+ (87 pm). On the contrary, a lattice parameter (corresponding to c lattice parameter in the tetragonal rutile) decreases up to y=0.5 and then becomes larger gradually, which may be attributed to the change in the \u03b2 angle, i.e., the inter-axial angle of ac plane.",
                                "As most of 3d metal difluorides (i.e. MF2) have similar structures, either based on the tetragonal rutile or the distorted rutile framework, it is expected that a large variety of solid solutions can be synthesized via mechanochemical reaction. Examples are Cu0.5Ni0.5F2, Fe0.5Ni0.5F2, and Ni0.5Co0.5F2. In FIG. 1F, the formation of new solid solution is verified by XRD. Cu0.5Ni0.5F2, Fe0.5Ni0.5F2, and Ni0.5Co0.5F2 formed the solid solution phase without any phase segregation, demonstrating the wide applicability of the solid solution fluoride system synthesized by the mechanochemical reaction.",

                                "Electrochemical measurements were performed on a series of CuyFe1-yF2 samples to investigate their electrochemical properties in the presence of two redox centers (FIG. 2a). During galvanostatic discharge, CuyFe1-yF2 exhibits a two-step lithiation process as expected, but the voltage profiles are different than those obtained from pure CuF2, FeF2, or a mixture of the two. In CuyFe1-yF2, the Cu conversion (higher plateau) occurs at similar potentials as CuF2, while the Fe conversion (lower plateau) occurs at a much higher potential and does not exhibit the voltage dip typically observed in pure FeF2, indicating a more facile Fe conversion. Even at low Cu concentration (e.g., 10%), significantly higher rate capabilities were achieved in Cu0.1Fe0.9F2 at room temperature. Similar to other solid-solution systems, the electrochemical properties in the ternary system, CuyFe1-yF2, are significantly affected by the cooperative redox of Cu and Fe sitting on the same lattice. The electrochemical cycling performance of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 was measured in the voltage range of 1.0-4.5 V (FIG. 2b). The initial discharge capacity is approximately 575 mAh g\u22121, comparable with the theoretical value (549 mAh g\u22121 for 2 electron transfer), and the charge capacity is \u02dc93% of this value for the initial discharge, indicating the re-oxidization of both the iron and the copper. The reaction process during the subsequent charge and discharge appear to be different than that during the first discharge, as evidenced by the change from two obvious plateaus (\u02dc2.9 and \u02dc2.2 V) to three plateaus (3.4, 3.0, 2.3 V). Upon subsequent cycles the voltage profiles are similar from cycle to cycle, indicating a high cycling reversibility.",
                                "In FIG. 2c, CV curves of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 were compared to that of FeF3 (Liu, P., Vajo, J. J., Wang, J. S., Li, W. & Liu, J. Thermodynamics and kinetics of the Li/FeF3 reaction by electrochemical analysis. J. phys. Chem. C. 116, 6467-6473 (2012)) in order to identify the origin of the cathodic peaks. Accordingly, one cathodic peak can be attributed to Fe0/2+ oxidation (at \u02dc2.8 V), another may to be due to the Fe2+/3+ oxidation (\u02dc3.4 V). The third at higher voltage (\u02dc3.8 V; being absent from the CV of FeF3) appears to be related to Cu0/2+ oxidation, and was confirmed by XAS measurements (FIG. 3). The initial discharge capacity is approximately 575 mAh g\u22121, being close to theoretical capacity (548.7 mAh g\u22121 for 2 Li transfer). The charge capacity is high, of about 93% to the initial discharge capacity, which indicates the re-oxidization of the converted Cu0 upon delithiation; otherwise 50% capacity loss should be expected during reconversion. In contrast to pure CuF2, which showed no reversible redox Cu peaks, the redox peaks in Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 are present over multiple cycles, indicating different electrochemical behavior in the solid solution ternary phase.",
                                "Besides the high reversibility (shown in FIG. 2b), the voltage hysteresis of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 are quite small, of about 0.63 V for Fe0/2+ redox, 0.43 V for Fe2+/3+, and 0.48 V for Cu0/2+ at a moderate rate (C/40). The values are much less than that of pure FeF2. This suggests that poor energy efficiency, one of the main issues in using conventional metal fluoride as cathodes, may also be alleviated by forming the solid solution. Furthermore, the voltage hysteresis measured by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) is reduced to 148 mV for the Cu0/2+ redox and \u02dc200 mV for the Fe redox, which is substantially lower than recent measurements for pure FeF2 (700 mV) and comparable to intercalation-type electrodes. This is the lowest reported hysteresis for conversion reaction in any metal fluoride, indicating the potential for achieving high-energy efficiency in ternary fluoride cathodes. In addition, these results also suggest that the hysteresis is not solely determined by the anions, but is also affected by the type of cations present.",

                                "XAS measurements on Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 in the as-synthesized state and at different (de)lithiation states were performed to identify changes in valence and the coordination of Fe and Cu during the 1st cycle (FIG. 3). Upon discharge, the near-edge structure in the XAS (XANES) indicates the Cu conversion occurs first (#1\u2192#4), followed by the Fe conversion (#4\u2192#8) at lower voltages. XANES spectra in Cu K- and Fe K-edges reveal an isobestic point, indicating the two-phase behavior of the conversion reactions. Simultaneous dissociation of Cu\u2014F/Fe\u2014F bond and formation of metallic Cu\u2014Cu/Fe\u2014Fe bonds at each plateau was also confirmed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). XRD measurements also indicated decomposition of the pristine solid solution phase and formation of metallic Cu0 after the high voltage plateau, while there is no visible diffraction peak of FeF2, indicating the highly disordered nature of the formed FeF2 after Cu conversion. The intermediate FeF2 is then reduced to metallic Fe0 at lower voltages, according to XRD, XANES, and EXAFS measurements.",
                                "At the initial stage of charge (#8\u2192#9), the oxidation state of Fe was increased from 0 to +2 while there is no noticeable difference observed in the valence state of Cu. Upon further delithiation (#9\u2192#11), the oxidation state of Fe continues to increase (indicated by edge shift to higher energies), along with the formation of 2nd isobestic point suggests the over-oxidation of Fe to Fe2+/3+. This is consistent with the similarity in the CV of FeF3 (FIG. 2c). Considering that there is excess LiF (coming from the Cu conversion during discharge) that can be consumed by Fe reconversion, it is possible that some of the reconverted FeF2 is further oxidized to form FeF2+\u03b4 phase (with Fe valence between +2 and +3). A strong Fe\u2014F peak in the final product, with similar bond distance as that of FeF6 octahedra in rutile phase, suggests the reconversion into a rutile-like framework.",
                                "In the high voltage region (above \u02dc3.4 V), the shift of Cu K-edge to higher energies is a direct experimental evidence proving the reconversion of Cu back to CuF2-like phase (#10\u2192#11). This is surprising as CuF2 has been considered suitable only for primary batteries for some time. Reconstruction of the Cu\u2014F bonds was also identified by EXAFS analysis. This may be the first experimental demonstration of the reversibility of the Cu conversion reaction in the fluoride system. The valence state of Cu was not fully recovered to the pristine state (+2) because of the deficiency of the LiF after the over-oxidation of Fe into FeF2+\u03b4 phase. A weighted XANES fitting indicates that the reconverted final phase is close to a 1:1 mixture of the metallic Cu0 and CuF2. Despite the reversible redox reaction, no crystalline MFx phase was observed in XRD after charge, indicating the formation of disordered fluoride framework. Furthermore, the local coordinate of Cu in the final product appears to be different from that in CuF2.",

                                "In the galvanostatic experiments (as in FIG. 2), the measured voltage is not solely determined by the intrinsic chemical potential (or thermodynamics), but strongly influenced by kinetics. To separate the intrinsic and kinetic factors, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements were performed on Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 during lithiation. Results are given in FIGS. 4a-4c with comparison to CuF2 and FeF2. The voltage difference before and after the relaxation denotes the degree of polarization applied upon the lithiation. FIG. 4a shows the GITT profiles for CuF2, Cu0.5Fe0.5F2, and FeF2 run under the same condition (current applied for 1 h with a 5 h rest). The quasi-equilibrium state was reached quickly in Cu conversion in CuF2 (i.e., small polarization) but not in Fe conversion in FeF2 or Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 within the same relaxation time. This may be explained by the high diffusivity of Cu atoms. The slightly higher polarization of Cu conversion in Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 may be due to the presence of neighboring Fe, i.e. hindering diffusion of Cu. It is also found that, in spite of the non-saturated voltage, the polarization of Fe conversion is reduced in Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 (by \u02dc0.21 V) compared to FeF2, demonstrating the improved Fe conversion kinetics in the solid solution.",
                                "GITT performed with a longer relaxation time (current applied for 5 h with a 50 h rest) was carried out on Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 and pure FeF2 to get the quasi-equilibrium state (FIG. 4b). The quasi-equilibrium voltage of each reaction is not identical in the pure and the solid solution systems. The quasi-equilibrium voltage of Fe conversion in Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 is higher by \u02dc0.25 V than that in FeF2, while there is small difference in Cu conversion (\u02dc0.07 V). This indicates that the two cations in the same lattice also influence each other on the intrinsic thermodynamic behavior (in addition to the kinetics). This may be explained by local phase reorganization that was identified by STEM-EELS measurements. The improved conversion kinetics in Fe is due to the formation of nanosized FeF2 intermediate surrounded by metallic Cu0 after Cu conversion at a higher voltage. Such nanostructure is believed to accelerate the Fe conversion reaction because of increased ionic conductivity via the massive LiF/FeF2 interface and the enhanced electronic transport attributed to metallic Cu0. The structural disordering, defect formation, and/or size reduction of the FeF2 product, as a result of the Cu conversion, may affect the increment of the quasi-equilibrium voltage of Fe conversion in the solid solution since they are strongly correlated with the free energy of materials. Similar observations, namely, elevated conversion potential were also reported in amorphous RuO2 (compared to crystalline phase). The change in the equilibrium voltage and the kinetics both contributed to the observed low hysteresis of Cu0.5Fe0.5F2 (FIG. 2b).",
                                "The GITT results show the advantage of using a solid solution for batteries, in particular on the lower-voltage-operating cation species (i.e., Fe in CuyFe1-yF2), in terms of reaction kinetics and voltage, and hence, the power capability. In this respect, it appears that minimizing the Cu content in CuyFe1-yF2, (i.e., doping of Cu in FeF2), may be a viable strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of FeF2-based cathodes. This hypothesis was verified by much improved electrochemical performance of Cu0.1Fe0.9F2 than FeF2, especially at higher currents, as shown in FIG. 4c. The specific capacity and energy density of Cu0.1Fe0.9F2 at 100 mA g\u22121 was approximately 400 mAh g\u22121 and 665 Wh kg\u22121 above 1.5 V while pure FeF2 was not active at all in this voltage range. The superior performance of Cu0.1Fe0.9F2, measured at room temperature without optimization (i.e. via making nanocomposites), is largely due to the in-situ formation of nanosized FeF2 surrounded with highly conductive Cu0. Because the doping can be easily applied to various compounds, this study indicates that doping of a second cation with a higher redox voltage is a promising strategy to improve the rate capability of conversion compounds.",

The electrochemical reaction and phase evolution during conversion process (Stages I & II) may be well understood, while the reaction during reconversion (Stages III, IV) is may be more complicated, and may follow a different pathway, as illustrated in FIG. 5. The reactions in Stage III, namely Fe reconversion into FeF2 and subsequently to rutile-like FeF2+\u03b4, may be similar to the observations in previous work. However, in this pathway, the reconversion of Cu back to fluoride phase in the Stage IV is revealed. In contrast to irreversible Cu redox in CuF2, the reconversion reaction of Cu is likely due to the reduced activation energy for the nucleation and growth of Cu-based fluoride phase at the surface of the pre-formed rutile-like FeF2+\u03b4. As illustrated in FIG. 5, due to the structural similarities, the nucleation of the Cu-based fluoride phase at the FeF2+\u03b4 surface should need less energy than that at the free space (i.e. direct nucleation of CuF2), which could subsequently reduce the overpotential and thus enable the reconversion reaction between Cu and LiF in the reasonable voltage window (<4.5 V). The achievement of the reversible Cu redox also allows for the measurement of the voltage difference of conversion and reconversion process, which is low, of only 0.48 V, according to CV measurements (FIG. 2b). It is believed this is the lowest voltage difference for conversion reactions in fluorides. This indicates the high energy efficiency of Cu conversion reaction besides the high reversibility, both being desired for use in batteries.",
