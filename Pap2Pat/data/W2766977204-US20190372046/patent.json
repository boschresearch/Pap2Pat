                        "A light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is a thin-film device, which in a common manifestation features a single-layer active material sandwiched between two air-stable electrodes.",
                        "The characteristic feature of the LEC, which distinguishes it from the more commonplace organic light-emitting diode (OLED), is the presence of mobile ions in the active material. When a voltage is applied between the electrodes, these ions redistribute to enable in-situ electrochemical doping of the organic semiconductor: p-type at the anode and n-type at the cathode; after a turn-on time, a p-n junction has formed in the active material. This dynamic doping mode allows for large and balanced electron and hole currents, and a high recombination rate of electrons and holes into excitons. Unfortunately, it also brings a challenge, since the exciton will be quenched when it impinges upon an electron or a hole (commonly termed \u201cpolarons\u201d), and this exciton-polaron quenching is severe in LEC devices\u2014to such a degree that it has been argued that high brightness (or luminance) and high efficiency are mutually exclusive.",
                        "The issue of exciton-polaron quenching has been addressed in triplet-emitting OLEDs through the design of a sophisticated device architecture comprising a multitude of different layers, where each layer has a specific task and an exact thickness on the nm-level. The central emitting layer is of a host-guest character, where the exciton is trapped on a triplet-emitting guest. This complex and exact device architecture is fabricated by sequential vapor deposition under high vacuum, and is as such not compatible with the simplicity of the LEC concept.",

C, 2015, 3, 8114, reports a light-electrochemical cell with a host-guest active material wherein the host material selected can be electrochemically p- and n-type doped and thereby result in LECs with improved luminance and efficiency: the current efficiency was 2.5 cd/A (corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 1.9%) at a luminance of 2000 cd m\u22122. Other host-guest LEC architectures have resulted in a wide variety of emission colors, but none of these devices has surpassed an efficiency of 10 cd/A at a luminance larger than 100 cd/m2 during steady-state operation.",

In any event, the electrodes are in operative contact with the active material, such that charge transfer from the electrodes to the active material is possible.",
                        "The first constituent of the active material comprises at least one host compound (e.g. 1-5, 1-4, 1-3 or 1-2 different host compounds). The first constituent may consist essentially of one or more host compounds. The first constituent may consist of one or more host compounds.",
                        "A host compound is here defined as a semiconducting compound that can be used for electronic charge transport. The energy gap of the host should be larger than the energy gap of the second constituent. Preferably, the LUMO energy level of the host should be higher than the LUMO energy level of the second constituent, and the HOMO energy level of the host should be lower than the HOMO of the second constituent.",

                        "Typically, the second constituent consists of one guest compound and the first constituent consists of one or two host compounds.",
                        "A guest compound is here defined as a semiconducting compound, which exists in a smaller number than the first constituent (i.e. the host(s)) in the active material. The energy gap of the guest should be smaller than the energy gap of the first constituent (i.e. the host(s)). Preferably, the LUMO energy level of the second constituent, the guest compound, should be lower than the LUMO energy level of the first constituent, and the HOMO energy level of the second constituent should be higher than the HOMO energy level of the first constituent.",
                        "The electrolyte of the active material may comprise a mixture of one or more electrolytes (e.g. 1-5, 1-4, 1-3 or 1-2 different electrolytes).",
                        "The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of different first and second constituents and electrolytes can be measured with e.g. cyclic voltammetry. Thus, the determination of a LUMO or HOMO level for a particular material is within the common general knowledge of a skilled person. As used herein, a first LUMO (i.e. the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) or HOMO (i.e. the highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level are \u201chigher than\u201d or \u201cabove\u201d a second LUMO or HOMO energy level if the first energy level is closer to the vacuum energy level. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the first and second constituents and the electrolyte are effective LUMO and HOMO energy levels.",
                        "When the first constituent comprises more than one host compound the LUMO energy level of the first constituent is the LUMO energy level of the host compound with the lowest LUMO energy level.",
                        "When the first constituent comprises more than one host compound the HOMO energy level of the first constituent is the HOMO energy level of the host compound with the highest HOMO energy level.",
                        "The second constituent has a smaller energy gap, i.e. the difference between the LUMO energy level and the HOMO energy level, than the first constituent, i.e. there can be an efficient energy transfer from the first constituent to the second constituent.",
                        "The second constituent should act as an electron, hole and exciton trap when combined with a first-constituent matrix, such that there should not be an efficient energy transfer from the second constituent to the first constituent.",
                        "The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the first constituent and second constituent should be such that the electron trap depth and the hole trap depth are symmetric, and Etrapn/Etrapp should be between 0.1 to 10.",
                        "The electron, hole and exciton traps are commonly called guest traps.",
                        "With \u201ccombination\u201d or \u201cblend\u201d is here meant that in the light-emitting active material the second constituent is dispersed in the first-constituent matrix on a molecular level, or combined into a larger molecule by a chemical bond. During steady-state operation there is emission essentially only from the second constituent, as may be confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) measurements.",
                        "The electrolyte should be electrochemically inert during LEC operation, that is, the preferred electrochemical reactions during LEC operation should be p-type doping (oxidation) and n-type doping (reduction) of the first constituent and the second constituent, and not electrochemical oxidation or reduction of the electrolyte. This property can be further explained in that the LUMO of the electrolyte should be higher than the LUMO of the first constituent, and the HOMO of the electrolyte should be lower than the HOMO of the first constituent. It is preferable if the LUMO level of the electrolyte is higher than the LUMO level of the first constituent by 0.1 eV or more, and that the HOMO level of the electrolyte is lower than the HOMO level of the first constituent by 0.1 eV or more.",
                        "This \u201cinertness\u201d feature can be measured with e.g. cyclic voltammetry and is verifiable in that the voltage will decrease and the luminance increase during the initial device operation at constant-current bias.",
                        "The mobility \u03bcn of the electrons on the first constituent and the mobility \u03bcp of the holes on the first constituent should be approximately symmetric, preferably the ratio B between \u03bcn and \u03bcp should be 0.01<B<100.",
                        "The mobility can be measured with e.g. time-of-flight measurements.",
                        "This light-emitting active material is designed so that the guest traps are compensated by electrolyte ions through doping in the transport (doping) regions next to the electrodes during the steady-state operation of the LEC.",
                        "Furthermore, this light-emitting active material is designed so that an emission zone exists in between the transport regions during steady-state operation, where efficient emission is stemming from excitons localized and effectively immobilized on non-compensated guest traps.",
                        "As the quotient between the number of ions of the electrolyte and the number of molecules or repeat units of the second constituent is \u2153 to 5 to compensate for guest traps in the transport regions of the active material, the electrolyte concentration in the active material is higher than what is normally used in high-performance LECs.",
                        "With repeat unit is here meant a part of a polymer whose repetition would produce the complete polymer chain (except for the end-groups) by linking the repeat units together successively along the chain in a linear or branched fashion. The polymer can also comprise two or more different repeat units, which are linked together in a random order in a linear or branched fashion.",
                        "Hybrid polymers having both first constituent repeat units and second constituent repeat units can be created. Quotients between first and second constituent should then consider the number of repeat units of the first constituent and the number of repeat units of the second constituent.",
                        "Hybrid polymers having first or second constituent repeat units and electrolyte repeat units can be created. Quotients between the second constituent and the number of ions should then consider the number of repeat units of the second constituent and the number of ions.",
                        "Hybrid polymers having first or second constituent repeat units, or electrolyte repeat units, and other influencing repeat units to improve device functionality e.g. by increasing viscosity of ink, improving optical properties, and alleviating phase separation, can be created. Such other influencing repeat units should not be seen as first constituent, second constituent or as electrolyte.",
                        "During steady-state operation of the LEC, the first and second constituents are electrochemically p-type doped in a p-type transport region next to the anode, and n-type doped in an n-type transport region next to the cathode and the first constituent and the second constituent support significant electrochemical p-type and n-type doping. This is verifiable with e.g. cyclic voltammetry.",
                        "In one embodiment of the present light-emitting electrochemical cell, there is a significant trapping of charge carriers, with a trap depth Etrapn and Etrapp of at least 0.1 eV, and a trap concentration ctrap equal to at least 0.02 (nm)\u22123.",
                        "During steady-state operation, essentially all traps in the p-type and n-type transport regions are filled by electrochemical doping, so that significant hole and electron currents can be supported at low overpotential (\u201cvoltage loss\u201d). Moreover, essentially all emission is originating from immobile excitons on guest traps in an \u201cundoped\u201d region in between the p-type and n-type region (the p-n junction), so that the exciton (the precursor of a photon) and electron/hole polaron populations are effectively separated. This is important since the electron/hole polaron is effective in quenching the exciton. This is verifiable by e.g. numerical simulation.",
                        "This desired operation is effectuated by that the electron and hole trap depths are similar in size, i.e. a quotient between a difference in LUMO energy level between the first and second constituent and a difference in HOMO energy level between the second and first constituent is 1/10 to 10.",
                        "When a light-emitting active material of a LEC has a symmetric electron trap depth and hole trap depth, a symmetric mobility on the first constituent, the electrolyte is electrochemically inert, and the quotient between the number of ions of the electrolyte and the number of molecules or repeat units of the second constituent is selected such that the guest traps are filled (or doped) in the transport regions next to the electrodes but non-filled (or non-doped) in the central emission region, the electron-to-photon external quantum efficiency of the resulting LEC device is above 4% when subjected to a current density of at least 50 A/m2. Such a high efficiency at a high current density has not previously been reported for LEC devices. It has long been considered impossible to attain high luminance at high efficiency from a LEC since efficiency-quenching exciton-polaron interactions typically are prominent at high luminance, but here these quenching interactions are suppressed by the separation of the doping and the light emission.",
                        "If the symmetry of the electron trap depth and the hole trap depth and/or the symmetry of the hole and electron mobility on the first constituent is lowered the efficiency of the obtained LEC is reduced.",
                        "During steady-state operation, essentially all emission is originating from the second constituent in the p-n junction region. If the second constituent is a triplet emitter, efficient triplet emission can be attained. This is e.g. verifiable with a combination of photoluminescence and electroluminescence.",
                        "With the present LEC more than 50%, or 60%, or 70%, or 80%, or 90%, or 95% or more than 99% of photons emitted during operation thereof may be emitted from the second constituent.",
                        "The origin of a photon can be decided by comparing the electroluminescence spectrum of the device with the photoluminescence spectra of pure films of the first and second constituents.",
                        "The quotient between the difference in LUMO energy between the first and second constituent and the difference in HOMO energy between the second and first constituent of the light-emitting active material may be 1/9 to 9, preferably \u215b to 8, 1/7 to 7, \u2159 to 6, \u2155 to 5, \u00bc to 4, \u2153 to 3, \u00bd to 2, \u2154 to 3/2, or \u2158 to 5/4.",

(Efficiency values as presented herein are reported at maximum luminance.) The pristine blend-host device turned on fast and reached 100 cd/m2 in less than 2 s and 3,000 cd/m2 within 25 s, and maintained a high luminance of above 1,000 cd/m2 for more than 3 h of continuous operation.",

                                "The PVK-host device in FIG. 5b delivered a peak brightness of 575 cd/m2 at an efficiency of 7.5 cd/A, and the luminance began to drop already after 10 s of operation. Its comparatively poor performance may be attributed to that the PVK host only can support p-type doping (FIG. 2a), and that electrochemical side reactions accordingly will take place at the cathodic interface during device operation. The even lower performance of the blend-host device with TMPE-OH:LiCF3SO3 as the electrolyte instead of THABF4 (FIG. 5d) is attributed to the insufficient electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte, which will effectively prohibit both p- and n-type doping of the host compounds (FIG. 2e and FIGS. 4a-e). The absence of conductivity-enhancing electrochemical doping reactions of the host compounds is further manifested in that the luminance decreases monotonically with increasing operational time.",
                                "The explanation for the one order of magnitude lower efficiency for the OXD-7 device in FIG. 5c in comparison to the blend-host device in FIG. 5a is at first glance less obvious. The OXD-7 host compound can be both p- and n-type doped (FIG. 2b) and the employed THABF4 electrolyte is electrochemically stable (FIG. 2e). However, with the results of the simulation study at hand (FIGS. 1c-f), the attention was directed to other material properties, in particular trap depths and charge carrier mobilities.",
                                "The nominal electron-trap depth (Etrapn) is equal to the difference between the (lowest) LUMO level of the host(s) and the LUMO of the guest, and the nominal hole-trap depth (Etrapp) is given by the difference between the (highest) HOMO of the host(s) and the HOMO of the guest (see FIG. 1a). Using the electron-energy diagram in FIG. 2f, it was found that for the blend-host LEC Etrapn=0.32 eV and Etrapp=0.38 eV; for the single-host OXD-7 LEC we obtain Etrapn=0.32 eV and Etrapp=1.06 eV. In other words, while the trap depths for electron and hole transport in the blend-host LEC are rather symmetric, they are notably asymmetric in the OXD-7 LEC. Moreover, the PVK:OXD-7 blend-host features a balanced electron and hole mobility, while the single-host OXD-7 material is an n-type material with a distinctly higher electron mobility. The simulation results demonstrated that an asymmetry in the trap depth (FIG. 1e), as well as an asymmetry in the electron and hole mobility (FIG. 1f), will result in an increase in detrimental exciton-polaron interactions, with a concomitant significant drop in the efficiency. Thus, the conclusion from both experiments and simulations is that it is paramount to pay attention to the symmetry of the trap-depth and mobility parameters when designing a high-performance host-guest LEC.",
                                "A range of different host-guest combinations have been investigated, and three additional host-guest LECs have been identified which feature high efficiency at strong luminance; see FIGS. 8a-c. With a green-emitting tris[2-(p-tolyl)pyridine]iridium (III) (Ir(mppy)3) guest, and the same PVK:OXD-7 blend host and THABF4 electrolyte, a current efficacy of 24.6 cd/A (EQE=6.9%) at 1,890 cd/m2 was recorded, and with a red-emitting tris[2-(4-n-hexylphenyl)quinoline]iridium (III) (hex-Ir(piq)3) guest an efficiency of 3.9 cd/A (EQE=4.9%) at 302 cd/m2 was measured. With a different TH123:TH105 host blend, and the Ir(R-ppy)3 guest, green emission with an efficiency of 27.4 cd/A (EQE=7.6%) at 2,100 cd/m2 was detected. It is interesting that these three high-performing host-guest LECs also feature bipolar doping, balanced mobility, and reasonably balanced trap depths. A comparison does however reveal that the PVK:OXD-7:Ir(R-ppy)3 LEC in FIG. 5a displayed the best performance (and the most symmetric trap depths), and in the following we have therefore opted to stay with this system. A summary of relevant device and material data is available in the table in FIG. 7.",
                                "A further demonstration of the suppressed exciton-polaron quenching in a well-designed host-guest LEC is provided by the efficiency-current plot in FIG. 9a. If such detrimental interactions are prominent, these will be manifested in a significant drop of the current efficacy with increasing current. Here, it was found that the current efficacy dropped marginally from 50.4 cd/A (EQE=14.0%) to 42.2 cd/A (EQE=11.7%) when the current density increased by a factor of twenty from 0.38 to 7.7 mA/cm2, which implies that polaron-exciton quenching indeed is minor. Note that the highest current efficacy of 50.4 cd/A was recorded at reasonable luminance of 193 cd/m2. It was further observed that the power conversion efficacy (PCE) features a stronger dependence on the drive current than the current efficacy, which is a reflection of a lowering of the drive voltage with decreasing current.",
                                "FIG. 9b presents the efficiency as a function of guest concentration for the host-guest LEC and a nominally similar OLED, void of the electrolyte and with low-work function Ca instead of Al as the cathode. The schematic LEC and OLED device structures are displayed in the insets of FIGS. 9a and 9b, respectively. Both devices display green emission from the guest compound for all concentrations (FIG. 6b), in agreement with the demonstrated efficient host-guest energy transfer. Interestingly, the LEC outperforms the OLED over the entire guest-concentration range, with the difference being largest at the higher guest concentrations. The peak efficiency of the LEC is 42.2 cd/A (11.7%), whereas the OLED peaked at 21.7 cd/A (6.0%) at a three times lower guest concentration.",
                                "To investigate the cause for the differences in performance, modeling results for a host-guest OLED with device-realistic injection barriers for electrons and holes of 0.2 eV and 0.5 eV, respectively, are presented (FIG. 9c), and for a host-guest LEC with a larger injection barrier of 1.0 eV for both electron and hole injection (FIG. 9d). Importantly, the opportunity for operating an LEC with large injection barriers is very attractive since it allows for the use of air-stabile electrodes and a single-layer active material. This clearly distinguishes it from the OLED, which is dependent on either an air-unstable cathode (here Ca) or a multilayer structure in order to function efficiently. Both the OLED and LEC featured symmetrical trap depths and mobilities, but in order to make the current density similar the absolute mobility was set higher for the OLED, which is reasonable in view of the absence of the electrolyte in the OLED. The absence of mobile ions in the OLED is manifested in much lower electron and hole concentrations (since there is no ion-induced screening of the electronic space charge) and a lack of electric double-layer formation at the electrode interfaces. Two more indirect consequences are that the excitons are evenly distributed, and the voltage gradient relatively constant, throughout the entire OLED active material, whereas they are well confined to the central p-n junction in the LEC device. While the simulated OLED in FIG. 9c delivers a modest electron-to-photon efficiency of \u03a6=8%, the LEC in FIG. 9d features a much higher (\u03a6=51% at approximately the same current density (jOLED=3.4 mA/cm2, jLEC=4.5 mA/cm2).",
                                "A significant fraction of the photons are trapped within the planar device structure by total internal reflection, and in order to access these photons two different outcoupling structures were attached onto the transparent substrate: (i) a flexible thin film comprising a hexagonal array of hemispherical microlenses as the surface structure (MLA-LEC), and (ii) an index-matched glass half-sphere (GHS-LEC). The transient optoelectronic response is presented in FIG. 9e, and with the MLA-LEC a current efficacy of 66.8 cd/A at 1,285 cd/m2 was measured and with the GHS-LEC, 99.2 cd/A at 1,910 cd/m2 was reached. The latter corresponds to an impressive external quantum efficiency of 27.5%. For the same device a stress lifetime of 320 h above 100 cd/m2 was measured in FIG. 10a. The corresponding data at a higher current density of j=7.7 mA/cm2 are presented in FIG. 10b, and the GHS-LEC delivered a strong luminance of 7,200 cd/m2 at a retained high efficiency of 92.8 cd/A.",
                                "All devices up to this stage have featured a small light-emission area of <0.2 cm2 as fabricated by spin-coating, but also large emission-area LECs were fabricated by more scalable spray-coating (or more specifically \u201cspray-sintering\u201d) using an in-house developed automated spray-coating apparatus. The photograph in FIG. 9f shows the uniform green light-emission from such a 45 cm2 large-area host-guest LEC, with its 350 nm thick active material deposited by spray-sintering under ambient air, as displayed in the inset photograph. The large-area LEC device was driven with a constant current density of j=1.1 mA/cm2, and delivered a luminance of 150 cd/m2 at a current efficacy of 13 cd/A, despite being void of an outcoupling structure. This result indicates that the introduced approach to high-efficiency, high-luminance LEC operation is relevant also for practical low-cost and/or large-area device configurations, and as such could pave the way for a wide range of novel and important applications in, for instance, home health care and portable signage where high-brightness operation at low energy consumption and low cost can be a fundamental criterion."
