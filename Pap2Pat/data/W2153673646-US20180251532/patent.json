                        "Apoptosis plays a critical role in maintaining normal tissue homoeostasis in multicellular organisms and its deregulation results in an imbalance of homeostasis contributing to several diseases (1,2) The BCL-2 protein family plays a central role in regulating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (3,4) The mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is considered the key event that is regulated by the complex network of protein-protein interactions between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family. Activation of pro-apoptotic members BAX and/or BAK is required for induction of MOMP, whereas the anti-apoptotic or survival proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1, inhibit the pro-apoptotic proteins and prevent MOMP. Activation of BAX and BAK or inhibition of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins is regulated by direct interaction with the BH3-only proteins.",
                        "The activation pathway of BAX represents the gateway to apoptosis and understanding the function of BAX and its regulation mechanisms is an area of intensive investigation. BAX is predominantly found in the cytosolic compartment in an inactive conformation (5,6). Upon cellular stress, BAX is triggered and undergoes a series of conformational changes that enable its translocation to the mitochondrial membrane and oligomerization leading to MOMP induction (7,8). The structure of the BAX monomer in the inactive conformation was previously determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (9). The inactive BAX structure adopts a typical BCL-2 fold, consisting of nine \u03b1-helices linked with variable loops. In contrast to BAK and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins that reside at the mitochondrial outer membrane, the structure of BAX was determined with its hydrophobic C-terminal helix \u03b19 bound to the canonical hydrophobic groove. When the C-terminal \u03b19 helix dissociates from the canonical hydrophobic groove, it binds to the mitochondrial outer membrane facilitating the mitochondrial translocation of BAX (9). Structural analysis of a hydrocarbon stapled BIM BH3 helix bound to monomeric BAX uncovered an activation site at the N-terminal surface of BAX (10). This activation site regulates the trigger mechanism for conformational activation of cytosolic BAX leading to the release of the hydrophobic \u03b19 helix and exposure of the hydrophobic \u03b12 helix (BH3 domain) (10-12). Mitochondrial translocated BAX undergoes further conformational changes on the membrane that induce BAX oligomerization and MOMP (13-16), or is inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (17-20).",
                        "A number of diseases and disorder are associated with premature or unwanted cell death and characterized by abnormal activation of BAX. The present invention addresses the need for inhibitors of BAX activation for therapeutic treatments."

                                "Synthetic antibody technology was applied to BCL-2 family proteins to probe novel conformations and functional regions on the surface of BAX. Synthetic antibody discovery utilizes diversity targeted to the antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) that is encoded by designed, synthetic oligonucleotides and screened by phage or yeast display (22,23). Since library construction and selection is performed entirely in vitro, the state of the target can be controlled through the antibody discovery process. Therefore, the specificity of the output antibodies can be tuned to user-specified stringency (24,25). Using a phage display screen, synthetic antibodies were identified that bind with high affinity and specificity to BAX. Although BAX can be expressed and purified readily, and studied by NMR and other biophysical techniques, it is prone to aggregation under some conditions (such as detergents). This aggregation phenomenon is presumably linked to its function of forming oligomeric pores in the mitochondrial membrane, but presents a formidable challenge in raising conformation-specific antibodies using techniques requiring immunization. Thus, there was a strong rationale for utilizing in vitro selection.",
                                "Antibodies were identified that can be used as structural and biochemical probes to dissect key regulatory mechanisms and conformations of BAX (26,27). Fourteen novel synthetic antibody fragments (Fabs) were identified that specifically target BAX. These synthetic Fabs have no significant homology in the CDR sequences suggesting a diversity of molecular interactions with BAX. They bind to BAX with nanomolar affinities and occupy overlapping binding sites on BAX. Additionally, the synthetic Fabs inhibit BAX in assays using liposomal membranes or isolated mitochondria. Further analysis using isolated mitochondria suggest that the Fabs bind to cytosolic BAX and inhibit its ability to translocate and insert onto the mitochondria outer membrane. Structural studies using NMR and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry showed that a representative synthetic Fab (3G11) forms a stoichiometric and stable complex with monomeric and inactive BAX, with a binding site that involves residues of helices \u03b11/\u03b16 and of the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop. Therefore, binding of the synthetic Fabs overlaps with the N-terminal activation site of BAX suggesting a novel mechanism of BAX inhibition through direct competition with the BAX activation process. These Fabs provide new tools for probing BAX activity in an unparalleled manner and provide a strategy for therapeutic inhibition of BAX in disease."

The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by using the BugBuster lysis reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Madison, Wis.). The lysate was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to a nickel column (Ni-NTA resin, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) pre-equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7. The Fab-bound Ni-NTA column was then washed with 20-column volume TBS buffer with 20 mM imidazole. Next, the protein was eluted with TBS buffer with 250 mM imidazole. The eluent was dialyzed into PBS at pH 8.0, and applied to a Protein A affinity column (beads from Pierce Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) for further purification. The Fab-bound beads were washed with PBS, pH 8.0 (15 column volumes), and the Fab proteins were eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.0. The eluted Fab proteins were immediately neutralized to \u02dcpH 7 using 1 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the Fab proteins were buffer-exchanged into PBS, pH 7.0 and were used directly in following binding and activity assays, or flash-frozen and stored at 80\u00b0 C. for future use. The Fab protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients at 280 nm were calculated from the Fab protein sequences using ExPASy.",

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, N.Y.) subcloned the Fab sequences from pCDNA3.1 to pMSCV. To easily detect the expression of Fabs and use them in pull-down experiments, 6 Myc tag sequences were included as an N-terminal tag to each scFv sequence during the cloning process. Transient expression of five Fabs in Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts (MEF) demonstrated that all Fabs are well expressed at similar levels. For more efficient transfection, Fab plasmids were transduced with retroviral transfection and stable Fab-expressing clones were selected using GFP as a selection marker. Co-immunoprecipation experiments using anti-myc agarose beads pulled down the Fabs and demonstrated their capacity to bind BAX in cells using anti-BAX Western analysis.",

Briefly, 3 \u03bcl of stock solution of BAX at 1.0 mg/ml was mixed with 9 \u03bcl of H2O buffer (8.3 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, in H2O, pH7.2) at 0\u00b0 C. and then quenched with 18 \u03bcl of ice cold quench solutions of 0.8% formic acid, 16% Glycerol, and GdnHCl at final concentrations of 0.05 M, 0.5 M, 1.0 M and 2.0 M. The quenched samples were frozen on dry ice and then subjected to an immobilized pepsin column (1\u00d720 mm, 30 mg/ml porcine pepsin (Sigma)) for online digestion for 40 sec. The resulting peptides were collected on a C18 trap (Michrom MAGIC C18AQ 0.2\u00d72) and separated using a reversed phase C18 column (Michrom MAGIC C18AQ 0.2\u00d750 3 um 200 \u212b) with a 30 min linear gradient of 0.046% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 6.4% (v/v) acetonitrile to 0.03% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 38.4% (v/v) acetonitrile. The effluent was directed into an OrbiTtrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Sci. Inc) for MS analysis. The instrument was operated in positive ESI mode and the resolution of the instrument was set at 60,000. Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Sci. Inc.) was used to identify the sequence of the resulting peptides. The optimal quench condition with the best coverage map of BAX (0.08M GuHCl in 0.8% formic acid) was used for subsequent functionally deuterated studies. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions were initiated by diluting 3 \u03bcl of pre-chilled protein stock solution (free BAX, 1 mg/ml, or antibody-bound BAX, 2 mg/ml) into 9 \u03bcl D20 buffer (8.3 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, in D20, pDREAD 7.2).

HADDOCK calculations generated models of the complex that are in agreement with experimental distance restraints and have optimal electrostatic and van der Waals interactions based on a combination of molecular dynamics and energy minimization. HADDOCK docking was performed using the BAX NMR structural ensemble imported directly from the PDB (PDB ID: 1F16). The 3G11 structural model was generated using PIGS software based on structural homology modeling of known Fab structures of the same family that have different amino acid composition of CDR regions (32). Calculations were performed with ambiguous interaction restraints (AIR) derived from the hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry data and residues of the CDR regions of 3G11. For BAX AIR calculations, only residues that exhibited significant protection of hydrogen deuterium exchange upon titration and solvent accessibility over 50% as determined by the program NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993) were defined as active residues; passive residues were automatically assigned by the HADDOCK web interface as those residues surrounding the active residues. For 3G11, AIR restraints were assigned based on residues involved in the CDRH1, CDRH2, CDRH3, and CDRL3. Specifically, active residues for BAX included residues 19-25 and 123-142; active residues for 3G11 were defined as Heavy Chain: 26-32 (Loop 1), 52-54 (Loop 2), 96-101 (loop 3) and Light Chain; 141-148, 165-168, and 206-211. In each HADDOCK structure calculation, 1000 orientations/structures of the complex were generated by rigid-body docking energy minimization of the individual structures. The 188 lowest energy structures were semi-flexibly refined in torsion angle space and then refined in explicit solvent. 132 structures formed the most populous cluster (HADDOCK score=\u2212140.5\u00b112.1 and Z-score=\u22121.7) with RMSD from the overall lowest energy structure (1.9\u00b11.1 \u212b) calculated on the backbone (CA, C, N, O, P) atoms of all residues involved in intermolecular contact using a 10 \u212b cut-off.

                                "A restricted diversity phage antigen-binding fragment (Fab) library (\u201cLibrary F\u201d) was used to select a panel of Fabs that bind to monomeric BAX (9). Library F was designed to contain mostly binomial Tyr/Ser diversity in CDR-H1 and H2, and expanded diversity, encoding the nine amino acids Tyr/Ser/Gly/Ala/Phe/Trp/His/Pro/Val in a 5/4/4/2/1/1/1/1/1 ratio, at CDR-L3 and H3 (33). In addition, the CDR-L3 and H3 loops vary in size. The expanded diversity in CDR-L3 and H3 in Library F was designed to mimic the distribution of amino acids in functional CDR-H3 segments of natural antibodies. Library F was screened against the monomeric BAX, which that was purified after utilizing chitin-column affinity purification and size exclusion chromatography (10). After 2-3 rounds of stringent selection, a panel of 14 BAX-specific Fabs with diverse CDR sequences was obtained (FIG. 1A). These clones were isolated from two distinct panning regimes, one in which biotinylated BAX was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated wells, and another in which BAX was coated directly on the wells. The properties of the selected clones were similar from either screening regime and thus further analyzed as a single conglomerated panel. Sequence comparison between the 14 Fabs revealed high diversity of residues and loop sizes in many positions with no apparent sequence homology in CDR segments from any two clones, demonstrating the diverse modes of interaction with BAX.",
                                "Fabs were expressed and purified and the half-maximal binding titers (EC50) for BAX using ELISA were determined. The EC50 values ranged from high affinity 2.3 nM (2B1) to moderate affinity 250 nM (2A5) with most Fabs having single or double digit nM nanomolar EC50 (FIG. 1A). Select Fabs 3G11, 3E8, 2A5 and 2B1 were evaluated for binding kinetics to monomeric BAX using Biolayer Interferometry (FIG. 1B). The binding affinities (KD values) and ranking of the Fab proteins based on binding correlate with the EC50 from ELISA. In both assays, Fabs 3G11, 3E8 and 2B1 were the highest-affinity binders to BAX, while Fab 2A5 was the lowest-affinity binder (FIG. 1A, 1B). Hence, an array of 14 high-affinity antibodies against monomeric BAX was identified.",
                                "To explore if the Fabs engaged overlapping or distinct epitopes on BAX, competitive ELISA was performed using six of the clones (3H1, 3G11, 3E8, 2A5, 2D9 and 2B1) whose EC50 values cover the entire affinity range. A competitive ELISA was performed in which Fab 3G11 was first biotinylated (b3G11) and binding of b3G11 to BAX in the presence of other non-biotinylated Fab proteins was analyzed. All Fabs except Fab 2A5 demonstrated competitive inhibition of b3G11 binding with IC50s ranging from nM to \u03bcM (FIG. 1C). Fab 2A5 does not compete b3G11 binding likely because it is a much weaker binder than 3G11. Furthermore, a study was also conducted of how binding of phage-expressed Fabs (\u03a6) can be competitively inhibited by free Fab proteins. The data showed that phage-expressed Fab binding was inhibited to varying degrees in the presence of 100 nM Fab protein for many of the clones and that, in each case, the phage-expressed Fab for a particular clone could be inhibited by its own Fab protein (FIG. 1D). Again, Fab 2A5, the lowest affinity clone (EC50=250 nM) had little effect on Fab phage binding for all the other clones, but all the other Fabs proteins could significantly inhibit Fab 2A5 phage binding. On the contrary, Fabs 3E8 and 2B1, the highest affinity clones (EC50s=2.6 nM and 2.3 nM, respectively) showed the strongest inhibition on all Fab phage binding. Therefore, the competitive ELISA data matches predictions based on ELISA half-maximal binding titers and KD values. These results indicate that, to a large extent, these Fabs have overlapping epitopes on the BAX surface with a range of affinities, but many in the low nanomolar range.",
                                "Synthetic Antibodies Inhibit BH3-Triggered BAX Activation and MOMP\u2014",
                                "To examine how binding to BAX by Fabs proteins modulates BAX function, liposomal assays were performed that explicitly evaluate how BH3-triggered BAX forms a pore in a membrane environment made from similar lipid composition of mitochondria without the contribution of other mitochondrial factors (34). Selected Fabs have the potential to activate BAX by engaging one of the activation sites of BAX either at its N-terminal or C-terminal surface (10,15,35,36) or inhibit BAX activation by inhibiting the BAX binding surface of the activator protein tBID or conformational changes associated with BAX activation (12,15,16,20,37). Therefore, the capacity of the Fabs to either activate BAX or inhibit BAX activation induced by tBID was examined. None of the 14 Fabs had an effect on the liposomal integrity alone; neither does an unrelated vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-specific Fab (YADS1, negative control). Furthermore, none of the Fab proteins activated BAX and induced liposomal release (FIG. 2A). However, when tBID and BAX are combined with liposomes, liposomal release is robust as expected (FIG. 2A, 2B). In contrast, high affinity Fabs when combined with tBID and BAX inhibited tBID-triggered BAX activation significantly, or completely, at 2 \u03bcM, in all cases, except with the exception of the lower affinity clone Fab 2A5 and the negative control YADS1 (FIG. 2B). Three of the highest binding Fabs 3G11, 3E8 and 2B1 yielded dose-responsive and time-dependent inhibition of liposomal release whereas the weaker binder 2A5 had no effect even at 2 \u03bcM (FIG. 2C-2F).",
                                "To examine whether Fabs can inhibit BAX activation in the presence of mitochondrial membranes loaded with anti-apoptotic BCl-2 or other mitochondrial proteins, mouse liver mitochondria were isolated from Bak\u2212/\u2212 mice to perform a mitochondrial release assay. Combination of tBID and BAX was exposed to several doses of Fab 3G11, which demonstrated dose-responsive inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release induced by activated BAX, as assessed by separation of the supernatant and mitochondrial fractions and western analysis (FIG. 3A). Moreover, using the mitochondria assay, BAX localization was determined to examine whether inhibition by Fab 3G11 was due to prevention of BAX translocation to the membrane or blocking of the membrane integration and oligomerization on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Fab 3G11 dose-responsively inhibited the capacity of BAX for mitochondrial translocation suggesting that 3G11's high affinity binding to the monomeric BAX either competes binding of tBID or prevents conformational changes of BAX required for its mitochondrial translocation (FIG. 3B). Taken together, these data indicate that these Fab proteins inhibit BH3-triggered BAX activation and MOMP by restraining mitochondrial membrane translocation of BAX.",
                                "Fab 3G11 Protein Forms a Stable and Stoichiometric Complex with BAX\u2014",
                                "To investigate the effect of synthetic Fab proteins on the structure of BAX, the stability and stoichiometry of several Fab-BAX complexes were studied upon mixing the protein at various concentrations and analyzing by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (data not shown). Based on gel SEC and SDS-PAGE analysis, binding of the Fab 3G11 to BAX results in a stable 1:1 stoichiometric complex. 3G11 was selected for further structural analysis because of its high affinity and low dissociation constant (FIG. 1B). Next, structural effects of the 3G111 were analyzed based on 1H-15N HSQC spectra of full length BAX monomer at several doses of 3G11. The HSQC spectra are in agreement with the 3G11 and BAX forming a stable complex, with a 1:1 stoichiometry and in slow exchange on the NMR time scale as evidenced by the dose-dependent loss of intensity of the cross peaks of the monomeric BAX and lack of new chemical shifts upon 3G11 titration. Despite the 3G11-BAX complex formation evidenced by the NMR titration, it is not possible to observe the 1H-15N cross peaks of the complex in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra due to the size of the complex (70 KDa).",
                                "Fab 3G11 Protein Binds the N-Terminal Surface of BAX to Prevent BAX Activation\u2014",
                                "To further analyze the Fab-BAX interaction, the changes on the BAX structure were analyzed by measuring the solvent accessibility and hydrogen-deuterium exchange of the backbone amide hydrogens using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS). First, the deuterium exchange of unbound BAX was analyzed in solution, which underlined the different deuterium exchange rates for exposed or unfolded regions (N-terminus, \u03b11-\u03b12 loop) and more solvent-protected or structured regions including \u03b12, \u03b13-\u03b14, \u03b15, \u03b16-\u03b18. Upon 3G11-BAX complex formation at stoichiometric levels, deuterium exchange, sample digestion, preparation and analysis was performed in the same conditions as with free BAX. Interestingly, HXMS analysis of the Fab-bound BAX in solution highlighted significant solvent protection in helix \u03b11 and \u03b16 and the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop while other regions of the BAX structure had little to no change in the deuterium incorporation upon interaction with the 3G11. Furthermore, HXMS showed a modest increase in solvent accessibility for residues in helices \u03b17, \u03b18 and partially \u03b19 and \u03b12 that are found at the C-terminal surface of BAX. Binding of the 3G11 Fab to full-length BAX (BAX WT) and to the C-terminal helix \u03b19-truncated BAX (BAX AC) was determined with similar dissociation constant KD (Table 1), suggesting that major contacts of 3G11 occur elsewhere from the \u03b19 or the canonical hydrophobic groove of BAX.",
                                "The HXMS analysis suggests that the binding region of the 3G11 is localized on the N-terminal surface of the BAX structure and overlaps with the 1) N-terminal trigger site of BAX (\u03b11/\u03b16) that controls a series of conformational changes upon BH3 domain activation (11-12) and 2) the binding epitope (residues 12-24) that is recognized by the 6A7 antibody only on the conformational active BAX (FIG. 4). Interestingly, the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop, whose displacement was determined to be essential for the initiation of conformational changes upon BH3-triggered BAX activation (12), is protected by the Fab binding interaction. Thus, the binding interaction of 3G11 to BAX is localized to the N-terminal surface of BAX, overlapping with the N-terminal trigger site and preventing conformational changes that lead to activation of the monomeric BAX.",
                                "Although recent structural studies based on peptides from the cytomegalovirus protein vMIA (38) and BCL-2 (20) proteins suggested potential sites that intervene with BAX activation, interestingly, none of these peptides directly block the N-terminal activation site of the soluble BAX or the C-terminal activation site of the mitochondrial associated BAX. A protein-protein structure calculation approach (39) was used to further confirm this novel interaction of 3G11 bound to the N-terminal surface of BAX. HADDOCK structure calculations were performed using ambiguous interaction restraints between BAX residues determined by HXMS to be most protected from solvent upon 3G11 binding (residues of the \u03b11, \u03b16 and the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop) and residues of the CDR regions present in the 3G11 protein sequence. Furthermore, calculations included an NMR structural ensemble of BAX with different loop conformations. Based on these calculations, the 3G11 binds more favorably in a direct interaction with N-terminal trigger site of BAX and the closed conformation of \u03b11-\u03b12 loop (10,12). 3G11 protein makes interactions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature with the solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues and polar/charged residues of the BAX trigger site covering a large interface surface of (1640 \u212b).",
                                "To validate the 3G11 direct interaction with the N-terminal trigger site, it was tested whether mutations on BAX can disrupt binding to 3G11 and affect its inhibitory activity of 3G11 in liposomal ANTS/DPX release assays. The 3G11-BAX structural model was used. Residues on BAX were selected that form contacts with residues of 3G11 using a 3 \u212b cutoff. Residues K21 in helix \u03b11 and R134 in helix \u03b16 have previously been shown to interact with the stapled BIM BH3 peptide that activates BAX through the N-terminal trigger site (10). Further analysis of the structural model showed that R134 residue forms hydrogen bonds with four residues (S30, Y31, Y32, S33) in 3G11 CDR-H1 loop while the K21 residue is predicted to form one hydrogen bond interaction with residue 5143 in 3G11. Consistently with the predicted contributions of each residue to the interaction with 3G11 Fab, liposomal ANTS/DPX release experiments showed that the inhibition effect of 3G11 on BAX WT activation by tBID is weakened with the presence of the K21E mutation, but it is was completely abolished with the R134E mutation (FIG. 5A-5E). Likewise, the double mutation R134E/K21E also abolished the capacity of 3G11 to inhibit BAX activation (FIG. 5D, 5E). The inability of 3G11 to inhibit activation of these BAX mutants is consistent with the decreased affinity of 3G11 to these BAX mutants as determined by ELISA binding experiments (FIG. 5F). Thus, the data suggest that 3G11 binds and blocks access to the N-terminal trigger site of BAX and therefore directly prevents BAX activation and its associated conformational changes. In accordance, mapping the predicted BAX interacting residues based on the 3G11-BAX structural model and residues of the trigger site that interact with the stapled BIM BH3 peptide as determined by NMR studies demonstrates an extensive overlap (10). Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of BAX inhibition and demonstrate the capacity of the reported Fabs as structural and functional probes of BAX."

                                "Decision of cellular life or death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, in physiological or disease conditions, is mainly controlled by the interactions among the BCL1-2 family proteins. Activation of pro-apoptotic BAX is essential for apoptosis to proceed through mitochondrial dysfunction and caspases activation. Here, synthetic antibody technology was harnessed to generate high affinity BAX binding antibody fragments (Fabs). The screen identified at least 14 different Fabs with sequence diversity in CDR regions that bind with nM affinity to BAX. Interestingly, the competitive ELISAs confirmed that the identified Fab proteins bind to overlapping regions of the BAX surface. Selected Fabs bind full length BAX, which represents cytosolic BAX (9). It was demonstrated that 3G11 binds C-terminal truncated BAX, which mimics the mitochondrial-associated BAX (15). Mitochondrial inserted BAX oligomerizes and undergoes dramatic conformational changes of the monomeric BAX to such extent that the N-terminal surface of BAX is not available for binding to Fabs (13,15,16,40). Therefore, selected Fabs are expected to be conformational specific for cytosolic and mitochondrial-associated BAX and inhibit both conformations from proceeding along the BAX activation process.",
                                "All of the identified BAX-binding Fabs inhibit BAX activation triggered by pro-apoptotic tBID in liposomal and mitochondrial assays. Further investigation of the mechanism, using Fab 3G11 protein, indicated that the Fabs bind to the N-terminal surface of BAX without causing significant conformational changes on BAX. HADDOCK calculations and mutagenesis show that 3G11 binds to an extended surface on BAX that includes the N-terminal trigger site (helices \u03b11/\u03b16), which BIM, BID, and PUMA pro-apoptotic BH3 helices bind to trigger BAX activation (10,11,36,38,41). The data indicate that 3G11 competitively inhibits tBID-mediated BAX activation by blocking access to the N-terminal trigger site and preventing N-terminal conformational changes associated with BAX activation (11,36). Indeed, 3G11-binding prevents mitochondrial translocation of BAX, which requires significant conformational changes and integration into the membrane (13,15,16,40).",
                                "BAX is shown to have two different activation sites depending on its cytosolic or mitochondrial associated conformations; the N-terminal BH3 pocket (trigger site) and the C-terminal BH3 pocket. Although several proteins have been reported to directly bind BAX and inhibit its activation, only two other studies reported structural evidence of the binding interaction on the surface of BAX. A stapled helical peptide of the BH4 domain of BCL-2 protein binds to a cleft formed by select residues of the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b15 and \u03b16 (20). A helical peptide of the cytomegalovirus protein vMIA binds to a distinct site at the same side of the BAX structure that includes the loops of \u03b13-\u03b14 and \u03b15-\u03b16 (38). In both cases, the peptides bind to a geographically distinct site that have no overlap with either of the N-terminal or C-terminal activation site. Therefore, these mechanisms of BAX inhibition reflect allosteric mechanisms that suppress conformational changes upon BAX activation. The present data indicate that the direct inhibition mechanism of BAX by 3G11 Fab through interaction with the N-terminal activation site is a feasible and effective mechanism of BAX inhibition.",
                                "Pharmacological targeting of BAX whether to either promote or inhibit its activation has been proposed to be a promising therapeutic strategy. However, discovery of pharmacological modulators of BAX has been challenging due to limited insights or lack of appropriate probes to use for small molecule discovery. Recently, small molecule BAX activators that bind to the BAX trigger site have been identified using a competitive binding assay of the stapled BIM BH3 peptide activator that binds to the same site (42). Likewise, the application of synthetic antibodies to BAX provides a novel opportunity to use Fabs as probes for screening small molecule libraries using a competitive binding assay between the identified inhibitory Fabs and BAX. Such small molecule inhibitors that bind directly to the BAX trigger site will be effective for development of therapeutics."
