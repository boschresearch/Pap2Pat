    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a method for concentrating and/or purifying prion PrPSc proteins by contacting prion PrPSc proteins with sepharose under conditions that allow for the specific and high affinity binding of the sepharose to the prion PrPSc proteins and removing the unbound non-prion proteins from the sepharose, as well as the same method for removing prion PrPSc proteins from body fluids by contacting body fluids with sepharose under conditions that allow for the specific and high affinity binding of the sepharose to the prion PrPSc proteins and removing the body fluid from said sepharose. In addition, the present invention is directed to a method for separating and/or enriching prion PrPSc proteins from PrPC proteins by contacting prion PrPSc proteins and PrPC proteins with a ligand-modified sepharose under conditions that allow for the specific and high affinity binding of the sepharose part to the prion PrPSc proteins and the binding of the ligand part of the sepharose to PrPC proteins, adding a selective release agent to the sepharose-bound proteins under conditions that allow for the release of non-prion proteins and PrPC proteins from the ligand part of the sepharose but not for the release of the prion PrPSc proteins, and removing the non-prion proteins and PrPC from the sepharose. Another aspect of the present invention concerns the use of the before-mentioned methods for concentrating, purifying and/or removing prion PrPSc proteins.",

                        "Native prion protein, referred to as \u201cPrPC\u201d for cellular prion protein, is widely distributed throughout nature and is particularly well conserved in mammals. The conversion of the native PrPC protein to the infectious protein, referred to as \u201cPrPSc\u201d for scrapie prion protein or as \u201cPrPres\u201d for proteinase K resistant prion protein, is believed to lead to the propagation of various diseases. Examples of prion-associated diseases include, for example, kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans; scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, transmissible mink encephalopathy and wasting disease in deer and elk.",
                        "BSE is a form of mad cow disease and is transmissible to a wide variety of other mammals including humans. The human form of BSE is referred to as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or vCJD. An estimated 40 million people in the United Kingdom ingested BSE-contaminated beef during the mid- to late 1980s. Because the incubation period for the orally transmitted disease may be 20-30 years, the true extent of this disease may not become apparent until after 2010.",
                        "In addition to the ingestion of infected beef, there is a potential for the transmission of prion-associated diseases among humans by blood transfusion. Since there are now (two) direct indications of prion transmission by blood transfusions, there is increasing concern about the security of blood products. Also, the infected prions have already been shown to be present on lymphocytes, and there is also evidence indicating that prions are present in the plasma in addition to being cell-associated. Furthermore, animals can become infected with prion-associated diseases by grazing on prion-contaminated soil or by ingesting hay that contains prion-infected hay mites.",
                        "The ability to detect and also to remove prion proteins from a sample is of profound importance in the food industry and the medical sector.",
                        "For detecting prion proteins a number of assays based on prion-specific antibodies have been developed. However, these assays require prior enrichment due to the very low concentrations of prion proteins in nature and in mammals, particularly in human blood, human or other mammalian organs for transplantation and in meat and processed foods derived from mammals.",
                        "A number of approaches for purifying prion proteins and derivatives thereof have been developed during the last decade. Affinity chromatography plays a major role as a suitable purification technique. In particular, sepharose gels have proven themselves as suitable support material for carrying ligands for affinity chromatography.",
                        "Grathwohl et al. (Arch. Virol. (1996) 141: 1863-1874) disclose the enrichment of PrPSc from mouse spleen of Scrapie-infected mice shortly after infection through immobilized metal (Cu2+) affinity chromatography (IMAC) employing divalent copper ion sepharose as support material. However, they found that for the diagnosis at the earliest stage of infection, extraction of PrPSc by salting out with Sarkosyl and NaCl was more effective.",
                        "WO 01/77687 compares the removal of PrPC prion proteins from a partially purified soluble preparation using specific hexapeptide ligands attached to sepharose with the removal achieved by the same sepharose material alone as reference material. SP-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose alone demonstrate a binding to PrPC that is 100 times lower than that achieved with the hexapeptide ligand-bound resins. As a matter of fact, the document states in this respect:\n\n\n- - \u201cAt pH 7.4 DEAE sepharose also does not appear to bind PrP^(C).\u201d",
                        "The low binding of SP Sepharose to PrPC is still more than 20 fold reduced over the binding of PrPC to silica, i.e. to an unspecific binder. From the fact that DEAE sepharose does not bind at all and that SP sepharose binds with very low and unspecific affinity to PrPC, it is clear that it is the SP (sulfopropyl group) part of the SP sepharose that is responsible for the low binding affinity. Hence, WO 01/77687 actually teaches the use of sepharose as an inert solid support for PrPC-specific ligands and that the SP part of SP sepharose can actually bind PrPC with an affinity more than 20 fold less than that of the unspecific binder silica.",
                        "The document of P. R. Foster (Transfusion Medicine, 1999, 9, 3-14) was published in 1999, a time when prion research was still in its beginning and the scientific community had no clue regarding the physicochemical composition of prion PrPSc proteins and the detection of the causative \u201cagent\u201d of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) still relied on elaborate and error prone animal studies with little quantitative significance. Furthermore, the document notes that PrPSc will generally tend to precipitate into the solids phase in a precipitation process due to its \u201cvery low aqueous solubility\u201d. In addition, it states that PrPSc has strong hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains that will adhere to many diverse surfaces and, in particular, will interact with chromatographic and filtration media used for the production of plasma products. The document informs that ionic, cationic, hydrophobic and a number of not identified resins will bind PrPSc. Even a cellulose-acetate membrane for filtration specifically pretreated to prevent adsorption will interact with PrPSc. However, all studies presented in this document were based on a reduction of TSE infectivity and did not demonstrate any actual binding of PrPSc to any adsorbents. It is specifically noted that next to adsorbent binding a reduced PrPSc activity can also result from other mechanisms, e.g. (i) precipitation of PrPSc in solution and mechanical retention by solids such as filters and chromatographic support materials and (ii) inactivation of PrPSc by contact to solids and/or with time. In this respect the author noted in his discussion of chromatographic materials that all examined adsorbents resulted in separation of PrPSc\u2014\n\n\n- - \u201c . . . despite the use of different ligands, matrices and\n    principles of adsorption.\u201d",
                        "Table 1 of this document also discloses a weak reduction in PrPSc infectivity for anionic, cationic and hydrophobic ligated sepharoses when compared to other adsorbents. However, the document does not disclose any material or method for practicing its teaching relating to sepharose itself nor does it refer to any other publicly available reference for these sepharose-related embodiments. Hence, the results relating to sepharose-based adsorbents lack an enabling disclosure. Furthermore, the results of table 1 are contradicted by the specification of this document where it was demonstrated that the employed SP sepharose has a high binding affinity while Q sepharose has essentially no binding affinity to PrPSc (Table on page 28). Regarding the fidelity of the results the author notes himself:\n\n\n- - \u201cMuch remains to be learned concerning the physicochemical\n    properties of TSE agents in general ( . . . ) and nvCJD in\n    particular. In the absence of such data it is inevitable that\n    uncertainty will exist over the ability of particular process steps,\n    either individually or in combination, to fully remove any nvCJD\n    agent which may be present.\u201d (emphasis added)",
                        "In other words, the author P. R. Foster himself recognized that in 1999 there were many inherent problems associated with the investigation of the potential of plasma fractionation steps to effectively reduce PrPSc and that the results of this document must be viewed as speculative and preliminary in said context.",
                        "A particularly elegant, sensitive and highly selective method for purifying and/or detecting human or animal prion proteins is based on the reversible aggregation and dissociation of prion proteins or derivatives thereof with one or more prion repeat structures that oligomerize with prion proteins at a pH of 6.2 to 7.8 and dissociate again at a pH of 4.5 to 5.5. For example, proteins with prion repeat structure(s) attached to solid support can oligomerize with prion proteins and thereby detect or remove these (PCT/EP2004 003 060).",
                        "At present, there is still a need in the art for further simple methods that concentrate, purify and/or remove prion PrPSc proteins in a simple, cost effective, highly selective and effective manner.",
                        "Due to the same amino acid sequence of PrPSc and PrPC proteins both are typically concentrated and enriched together and then separated by proteinase K digestion at a later stage wherein only PrPC proteins are selectively digested while PrPSc proteins remain proteinase resistant.",
                        "Hence, there is also a need for efficiently separating PrPSc from PrPC proteins other than by selective enzyme digestion.",
                        "Therefore, the object underlying the present invention is the provision of a simple, low cost, efficient and highly selective method for concentrating, purifying and/or removing PrPSc.",
                        "Another object is the provision of a simple, low cost, efficient and highly selective method for separating PrPSc from PrPC proteins.",
                        "The object underlying the present invention is solved by a method for concentrating and/or purifying prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof, comprising the following steps:\n\n\n- a) contacting prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and/or functional derivatives\n  thereof with sepharose under conditions that allow for the specific\n  and high affinity binding of said sepharose to the prion PrP^(Sc)\n  proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof,\n- b) removing the unbound non-prion proteins from the sepharose,  \n  wherein the sepharose is preferably not a Cu\u00b2\u207a-chelating sepharose.",
                        "It was surprisingly found that sepharose by itself (i.e. as such, naked, with inactivated, removed, masked ligands) has a specific and high binding affinity to PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof. Therefore, the binding of sepharose to PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof is sufficient for their concentration and/or purification. One merely has to remove the unbound non-prion proteins from said sepharose.",
                        "The term \u201cspecific and high affinity binding of sepharose to prion PrPSc\u201d as used herein is meant to indicate that the sepharose as such (i.e. the sepharose core but not any ligands thereon) binds specifically to PrPSc but not to PrPC. Preferably, specific binding of sepharose in the context of the invention means the binding of sepharose as such to PrPSc multimers but not to PrPC. The term high affinity binding in this respect is meant to refer to a binding affinity relating to a dissociation constant of 10\u22126 to 10\u221212 M or lower, preferably 10\u22128 to 10\u221212 M or lower. The skilled person can easily determine a specific and high binding affinity of a given sepharose to prion PrPSc by routine and simple binding assays. For example, one such assay would comprise the following steps:\n\n\n- - a) providing the sepharose to be assayed and removing, inactivating\n    and/or masking any ligands on said sepharose core if present,\n  - b) diluting the PrP^(Sc) used to a concentration that will avoid\n    unspecific removal, e.g. precipitation, unspecific binding, etc.,\n  - c) incubating the sepharose of a) and PrP^(Sc) of b) in a suitable\n    buffer under conditions and for a time that will allow for binding\n    to each other,\n  - d) one or more washing step(s), preferably 3 to 10 buffer volumes\n    incubation buffer, for washing out any unbound protein from the\n    sepharose,\n  - e) optionally washing with an excess, preferably a 1000 fold excess,\n    of unspecifically binding protein, preferably BSA (bovine serum\n    albumin), in order to remove or block any unspecific binding sites\n    on the sepharose,\n  - f) an elution step with a buffer comprising a chaotropic agent,\n    preferably urea and/or guanidinium chloride and/or SDS, in order to\n    remove sepharose-bound PrP^(Sc),\n  - g) detecting PrP^(Sc) in the eluted buffer and, thereby\n    demonstrating high affinity binding of the sepharose to PrP^(Sc) as\n    such.",
                        "For determining the specificity of the assayed sepharose, the above assay is repeated except that PrPC instead of PrPSc is incubated in step c) and PrPC is detected in the wash solution, thereby indicating the lack of binding. Alternatively, PrPSc and PrPC can be incubated simultaneously with the sepharose in step c) and a specific and high affinity sepharose will result in detecting PrPC in the wash solution and PrPSc in the chaotropic elution buffer only.",
                        "A more detailed and preferred assay for determining the specificity and high affinity binding of sepharoses is presented below in example 1.",
                        "In short, the term \u201cspecific and high affinity binding of sepharose to PrPSc proteins\u201d is meant to distinguish sepharoses and methods using these from sepharoses and said methods that merely bind PrPSc unspecifically and with low affinity, e.g. by precipitation and/or low adsorption.",
                        "The terms \u201cconcentrating and/or purifying\u201d as used herein are meant to indicate that the concentration of PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof is raised and/or non-PrPSc proteins and/or non-protein material(s) are removed.",
                        "This method can also be employed for effectively removing prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof from body fluids. In that case it comprises the following steps:\n\n\n- a) contacting a body fluid comprising prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and/or\n  functional derivatives thereof with sepharose under conditions that\n  allow for the specific and high affinity binding of the sepharose to\n  the prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof,\n- b) removing the body fluid from the sepharose.",
                        "Preferably said body fluid is selected from whole blood, blood fractions or brain homogenate, preferably from blood plasma. However, the body fluid may also encompass homogenates of mammalian tissues, in particular homogenates of brain tissue and spinal cord tissue.",
                        "It was also found that sepharose itself typically has an excellent compatibility with blood and as such no or at most a negligible effect on blood coagulation is observed when it is brought into contact with blood. Most ligated, metal-ligated and/or negatively charged sepharoses have also proven to be blood compatible. This is demonstrated by the results of Table 1 below, where the influence of a number of sepharoses for use according to the invention on common physiological protein parameters is tested. It was surprisingly found that sepharoses can be brought into contact with blood or blood fractions without harming or substantially altering blood parameters. Moreover, it was surprisingly found that metal-chelated sepharoses actually have a positive effect on the stability of coagulation factor VII.",
                        "Therefore, an independent aspect of the present invention is directed to novel compositions comprising coagulation factor VII, preferably the human coagulation factor VII, and further at least one metal-chelated sepharose, preferably Ni- and/or Zn-sepharose, more preferably Zn-sepharose. Another independent aspect is directed to the use of metal-chelated sepharose, preferably Ni- and/or Zn-sepharose, more preferably Zn-sepharose, for stabilizing blood, blood fractions and solid or liquid compositions comprising coagulation factor VII.",
                        "It is assumed without wishing to be bound by theory, that the advantageous effect of metal-chelated sepharoses on coagulation factor VII is based on stabilizing effects with regard to protease digestion and/or folding stability.",
                        "It should be noted that, in principle, any ligated or non-ligated sepharose can be employed for practicing the present invention(s) as long as the sepharose is not masked and, in the case that the blood is brought into contact with living cells in vivo and/or in vitro, is non-toxic. For practicing the method of the present invention for the removal of prion proteins from blood, metal-ligated sepharoses are preferred, negatively charged sepharoses are more preferred while non-ligated sepharoses and non-charged sepharoses are most preferred.",
                        "Surprisingly, the sepharose for use in the method of the present invention is not limited to any particular type of sepharose except that the sepharose core should be sufficiently accessible to the prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof for binding.",
                        "Preferably, the sepharose for practicing the method of the present invention is selected from non-ligated sepharoses, more preferably selected from the group consisting of Sepharose\u00ae 2B, 4B, 6B, Sepharose\u00ae CL-4B, Sepharose\u00ae-6B, Superdex\u00ae 75, Sephacryl\u00ae 100HR and Sephadex\u00ae G10.",
                        "Also preferred for practicing the methods of the present invention are sepharoses selected from ligand-modified sepharoses, preferably selected from the group consisting of metal-chelating sepharoses, lectin agaroses, iminodiacetic sepharose, protein A agarose, streptavidin sepharose, sulfopropyl sepharose and carboxmethyl sepharose, more preferably selected from metal-chelating sepharoses and most preferred the sepharose for practicing the methods, compositions or uses is Zn-sepharose.",
                        "Zn sepharose is highly compatible with physiological fluids. Neither the sepharose nor the Zn ion will have any detrimental effects on body fluids such as whole blood, blood fractions, preferably blood plasma. Therefore, Zn sepharose is particularly useful for removing PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives from body fluids and/or body organs, e.g. organs for transplantation, that are to be reintroduced into an animal, preferably a human.",
                        "As mentioned before, for practicing the methods, compositions or uses of the present invention it is necessary that the optional ligands do not mask the sepharose core so that prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof have free access. This is the problem with many ligand-modified sepharoses employed in the prior art. The skilled person can routinely select ligand-modified sepharoses that are sufficiently accessible for PrPSc binding by simply testing the sepharose binding affinity to PrPSc proteins, and, if desired, design appropriate ligand-modified sepharoses, e.g. by employing spacer molecules that position the ligand at an appropriate distance for the sepharose not to be masked by the ligand.",
                        "Another unexpected advantage of the method of the present invention is that the sepharose binding to prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof is highly selective with respect to prion PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof which do not have any significant binding affinity to sepharose by themselves.",
                        "Therefore, the method of the present invention does not only allow for selectively concentrating, purifying and/or removing prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof, but actually removes the highly analogous prion PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof, too.",
                        "When ligand-modified sepharoses are used, wherein the ligand part binds to prion PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof, the method of the present invention allows for the simultaneous concentrating and/or purification of prion PrPSc and PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof. The prion PrPSc and PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof can then be separated by selectively removing PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof from the sepharose.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment the present invention also relates to a method for separating and/or enriching prion PrPSc proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof from PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof, comprising the following steps:\n\n\n- a) contacting prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and PrP^(C) proteins and/or\n  functional derivatives thereof with ligand-modified sepharose under\n  conditions that allow for\n  - (i) the specific and high affinity binding of said sepharose part to\n    said prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof,\n    and\n  - (ii) the binding of said ligand part of the sepharose to PrP^(C)\n    proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof,\n- b) optionally removing unbound material from said ligand-modified\n  sepharose,\n- c) optionally waiting for a sufficient time period for some or most of\n  the ligand-bound PrP^(C) proteins and/or functional derivatives\n  thereof to convert into prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and/or functional\n  derivatives in the close proximity of the prion PrP^(Sc) proteins\n  and/or functional derivatives thereof,\n- d) adding a selective release agent to the sepharose-bound proteins\n  and/or functional derivatives thereof from step a), b) or c) under\n  conditions that allow for the release of PrP^(C) proteins and\n  optionally non-prion proteins from the ligand part of the sepharose\n  but not for the release of the prion PrP^(Sc) proteins and/or\n  functional derivatives thereof from the sepharose part, and\n- e) removing the PrP^(C) and optionally non-prion proteins from the\n  sepharose.",
                        "When prion PrPSc and PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof were present on the ligand-modified sepharose it was unexpectedly found that the amount of PrPSc is raised in many instances at the expense of PrPC. It is believed that PrPC and/or functional derivatives thereof are converted by a spontaneous conformational change in the close proximity of PrPSc that seem to chaperone this change. This finding is in line with the understanding that the presence of PrPSc is required for PrPSc \u201cproduction\u201d from PrPC precursors.",
                        "In a more preferred embodiment of the above method, said method further comprises the step of:\n\n\n- f) releasing PrP^(Sc) prion proteins and/or derivatives thereof from\n  the sepharose.",
                        "For releasing PrPSc prion proteins and/or derivatives thereof from the sepharose it is preferred to add chaotropic agents and/or detergents, preferably urea and/or guanidinium chloride and/or SDS, more preferred to add urea and/or SDS, most preferred to add a gel-loading buffer comprising 8 M urea and 5% SDS and applying an electrical field. Of course, any other non-destructive method routinely applied for interrupting enzymes' affinity to polymers, preferably sugar-derived polymers, can also be employed.",
                        "For practicing the methods according to the present invention, in particular a method for separating and/or enriching prion PrPSc proteins from PrPC proteins, it is preferred to employ a ligand-modified sepharose that is a metal-chelating sepharose comprising divalent immobilized metal ions.",
                        "Metal-chelating sepharoses as well as negatively charged sepharoses such as sulfopropyl sepharose and carboxymethyl sepharose may bind to PrPSc as well as PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof due to the binding of the sepharose part and optionally the negative charged and/or metal ligand part of the sepharose to PrPSc and the negatively charged and/or metal ligand part of the sepharose to PrPC.",
                        "The mechanism underlying the separation method of the present invention relies on the different binding properties of PrPSc and PrPC regarding sepharose-immobilized metal ions. While PrPSc seems to have an intrinsic affinity to sepharose, divalent metal ions and negative charges, PrPC seems to have an intrinsic affinity to divalent metal ions and negative charges only. Hence, their different affinity for sepharose can be employed for separating them.",
                        "Preferably, the metal ions of the metal-chelating sepharose are selected from the group consisting Ni2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Mn2+.",
                        "The binding of Ca2+ and Mn2+ is weaker and both ions bind only monomers of PrPSc and PrPC.",
                        "The other mentioned metal ions Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ bind stronger to monomers and oligomers of PrPSc and PrPC and are preferred for that reason. Because of its excellent binding properties and due to its lack of toxicity under physiological conditions in vivo Zn2+ is most preferred for the metal-chelating sepharose for practicing the methods, uses and compositions of the present invention.",
                        "Incidentally, Cu-sepharose will not retain PrPSc proteins efficiently as demonstrated in example 1. In example 1 the reloading of Ni-High Performance Sepharose with Cu2+ results in unspecific binding of large amounts of BSA (see also FIG. 4, lane 1) and is, therefore, not suited for the enrichment of prion proteins in complex protein solutions. Therefore, the Cu-sepharose IMAC presented by Grathwohl et al. will not provide the differential affinity necessary for a quantitative separation of PrPSc from PrPC. It is therefore generally preferred for all methods of the invention that the sepharose is not a Cu2+-metal-chelating sepharose",
                        "When a metal-chelating sepharose is employed for practicing a method of the present invention the selective release agent is preferably a metal chelating agent, preferably an agent selected from EDTA, imidazole and/or EGTA, more preferably EDTA.",
                        "For separating PrPSc and PrPC proteins and/or functional derivatives thereof from a metal chelating sepharose in a method of the invention it is most preferred that the metal is Zn2+ and the metal chelating agent is EDTA.",
                        "It is also preferred that the conditions in step d) of the method of the present invention for separating PrPSc and PrPC proteins that allow for the release of PrPC and optionally non-prion proteins from the sepharose-immobilized metal ions comprise the presence of a metal chelating agent in a concentration of 5 to 50 mM, more preferably 10 to 25 mM, most preferably EDTA at a concentration of 10 to 25 mM.",
                        "It was also found that the addition of small amounts of chelators such as EDTA, imidazole and/or EGTA to complex protein fractions such as blood fractions or brain homogenates can assist to avoid unspecific binding and therefore assists separation of unspecific material from PrPSc and/or PrPC proteins. For example, for some plasma fractions it was found that 10 to 25 mM EDTA reduced unspecific binding effectively. When working with sepharose-immobilized metal ions one must take care that the effects of reducing unspecific binding and releasing PrPC by chelators do not overlap if the release of PrPC is not yet desired. Moreover, depending on the presence and amounts of unspecifcally binding proteins the above preferred concentration ranges will have to be adapted, i.e. increased, to compensate for the presence of unspecific proteins that scavenge the chelators for PrPC release. Such an optimization is within the routine skill of those in the art.",
