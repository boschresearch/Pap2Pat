## DETAILED DISCLOSURE

A metal hydride battery comprises at least one negative electrode, at least one positive electrode, a casing having said electrodes positioned therein and an electrolyte composition in contact with the electrodes.

The electrolyte composition is useful in an electrochemical cell such as a metal hydride battery (metal hydride cell). The active material of the negative electrode (anode material) comprises an ABx type alloy capable of storing hydrogen where x is from about 0.5 to about 5. The alloys are for example ABx type metal hydride (MH) alloys where in general, A is a hydride forming element and B is a weak or non-hydride forming element. A is in general a larger metallic atom with 4 or less valence electrons and B is in general a smaller metallic atom with 5 or more valence electrons. The alloys are capable of reversibly absorbing (charging) and desorbing (discharging) hydrogen. For example, the MH alloys are capable of reversibly absorbing and desorbing hydrogen electrochemically at ambient conditions (25° C. and 1 atm).

The weight/weight ratio of the ionic liquids to the protic acids is for instance from about 99.5/0.5 to about 0.5/99.5, from about 99/1 to about 1/99, from about 95/5 to about 5/95, from about 90/10 to about 10/90, from about 80/20 to about 20/80, from about 70/30 to about 30/70 or from about 60/40 to about 40/60.

The weight/weight ratio of the ionic liquids to the organic solvents is for instance from about 99.5/0.5 to about 0.5/99.5, from about 99/1 to about 1/99, from about 95/5 to about 5/95, from about 90/10 to about 10/90, from about 80/20 to about 20/80, from about 70/30 to about 30/70 or from about 60/40 to about 40/60.

Additives may be incorporated in the electrolyte compositions of the invention.

Additives are for instance selected from the group consisting of corrosion inhibitors, solid electrolyte interface (SEI) improvers, proton evolution improvers, self-discharge inhibitors, anti-gassing agents, viscosity adjusting agents, cathode protection agents, salt stabilizers, conductivity improvers and solvating agents.

Corrosion inhibitors are for example fluorinated oil, sodium stannate, sodium citrate or polyacrylic acids.

Solid electrolyte interface improvers are for instance fluoride sources intended to fluorinate the surface of the metal hydride. Fluoride sources are for instance HF or KF. SEI improvers also include oxides or hydroxides of rare earths such as Y, which inhibit the formation of a thick oxide on the negative electrode. SEI improvers also include metal porphines which serve to reduce oxidation of the alloy surface. For example Ni or Fe porphine. SEI improvers may also incude vinylene carbonate, vinylethylene carbonate, methylene ethylene carbonate and fluoro-ethylene carbonate.

Self-discharge inhibitors include surfactants such as polyglycols, polyglycol alkyl ethers, polyglycol alkyl phosphate esters and polysorbates. Included are polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 40 and polysorbate 80. Advantageously, a mixture of PEG 600 and polysorbate 20 are employed together or a mixture of PEG 600 and ZnO are employed together.

Anti-gassing additives include phosphate ester-based surfactants, propane sultone and fluoropropane sultone.

Viscosity adjusting agents include for instance DMSO.

Additives are for example employed at a level of from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the electrolyte composition.

The present electrolyte compositions will not be limited by the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potential of water. Thus, the metal hydride batteries disclosed may exhibit a nominal open-circuit voltage of >1.2 V (volts). The present MH batteries may supply a nominal open-circuit voltage up to about 6 V. For instance, present MH batteries may exhibit a nominal open-circuit voltage of from about 1.2 to about 6.0 V, from about 1.3 to about 6.0 V, from about 1.4 to about 6.0 V or from about 1.5 to about 6.0 V. For instance, present MH batteries may exhibit a nominal open-circuit voltage of about 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9 or about 6.0 V.

As the electrochemical window is enlarged beyond that of water, further cathode active materials are possible. Further cathode active materials include transition metals and their oxides, hydroxides and fluorides. For example, further cathode active materials include Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Lu, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt and Au and their oxides, hydroxides, oxide/hydroxides and fluorides.

In further cathode active materials selected from the group consisting of metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal oxide/hydroxides, nickel may be present at a level of ≦5, ≦10, ≦15, ≦20, ≦25, ≦30, ≦35, ≦40, ≦45, ≦50, ≦55, ≦60, ≦65, ≦70, ≦75, ≦80 or ≦85 atomic percent, for instance ≦90 atomic percent, based on the total metals of the metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal oxide/hydroxides.

## EXAMPLES

In the following examples, all measurements are performed at ambient conditions of 25° C. and 1 atm, unless specified otherwise.

### Electrolyte Compositions Comprising Ionic Liquid and Acetic Acid

Electrolyte compositions are prepared by mixing ionic liquids with acetic acid (AA). Acetic acid concentration is reported in mol/L (M) in the ionic liquid. Conductivity of each composition is measured and reported in mS/cm at 25° C. Results are below.

It is seen that the presence of acetic acid in an ionic liquid leads to increased conductivity.

The electrolyte compositions are employed in a SWAGELOK cell assembly. A smaller anode is employed and therefore limits the capacity. Specific capacity is calculated based on the weight of the anode active material. The anode contains an AB5 rare earth/nickel based metal hydride active material. The cathode contains Ni(OH)2 active material and the separator is a conventional non-woven material.

Pure ionic liquids exhibit poor cell performance. Electrolyte compositions comprising an ionic liquid and 1 M acetic acid show improved cell performance. The compositions containing BMIM Ac especially show very good performance in terms of charge/discharge overpotentials and cycle stability.

### Electrolyte Composition Comprising Ionic Liquid and Solvent

A 1:1 volume mixture of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM Ac) and methanol is prepared and tested in a cell as an electrolyte as in Example 1. A discharge capacity of 78 mAh/g is obtained for a charge capacity of 400 mAh/g.

### Electrolyte Compositions Comprising Ionic Liquid and Protic Acid

Electrolyte compositions of 1 M H3PO4 in EMIM TFSI, EMIM TfO and DEMA TfO are prepared. The electrolytes are tested in a cell as in Example 1. The cells exhibit good charge/discharge characteristics. The example is repeated replacing phosphoric acid with each of citric acid, acrylic acid, methanesulfonic acid and oxalic acid.

### Electrolyte Composition Containing 2 M Acetic Acid in EMIM Ac

A charge/discharge test is performed employing 2 M acetic acid/EMIM Ac electrolyte composition in a cell as in Example 1. The NiMH cell is charged to 40 mAh/g and discharged until a cutoff voltage of 0.7 V. Several cycles are required to activate the cell. Charge voltage drops and specific capacity increases dramatically over the first 20 cycles. Coulombic efficiency reaches 70% at 23 cycles. The cell starts to degrade slightly after 50 cycles; after 147 cycles coulombic efficiency drops to 58%. The AB5 anode exhibits a specific capacity of 178 mAh/g when the cell is charged with a capacity of 400 mAh/g.

### Example 5

**Cyclic Voltammetry**

Cyclic voltammetry is performed for an AB5 anode with a 2M acetic acid/EMIM Ac electrolyte and with a 30 weight percent (wt %) aqueous KOH electrolyte at variable scan rates after activation. The electrode potential is scanned from 0 V to −1.2 V vs. a Hg/HgO reference for KOH and from 0 V to −1.6 V vs. a commercial leak-free reference electrode for 2 M acetic acid/EMIM Ac electrolyte.

At a scan rate of 500 mV/s, the hydrogen adsorption peak for 30 wt % KOH is observed at about −1.1 V. For the acetic acid/EMIM Ac electrolyte, a hydrogen adsorption peak is observed at −0.95 V and a further peak is observed at −1.55 V. There is an extra 0.6 V voltage window for the present acetic acid/EMIM Ac electrolyte.

**Electrolyte Compositions Comprising Ionic Liquid and Solvent**

Solutions of EMIM Ac and propylene carbonate (PC) are prepared and tested for conductivity. EMIM Ac levels are reported in volume % based on the EMIM Ac/PC mixture. Conductivity of each composition is measured and reported in mS/cm at 25° C. Results are below.

It is seen that a 1:1 volume mixture of an ionic liquid and PC is highly conductive.

**Ternary Electrolyte Composition Containing Ionic Liquid/Solvent/Protic Acid**

Mixtures of acetic acid and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM Ac) are prepared and tested for conductivity. The highest conductivity achieved is about 10.8 mS/cm for 1:1 weight mixture.

Electrolyte compositions are prepared by mixing acetic acid with 1:1 volume mixtures of EMIM Ac and propylene carbonate (PC). Acetic acid concentration is wt % based on the total mixture. Conductivity is measured and is reported below.

Electrolyte compositions are prepared by mixing methanesulfonic acid with 1:1 volume mixtures of EMIM Ac/PC. Methanesulfonic acid concentration is wt % based on the total mixture. Conductivity is measured and is reported below.

Electrolyte compositions are prepared by mixing acrylic acid with 1:1 volume mixtures of EMIM Ac/PC. Acrylic acid concentration is wt % based on the total mixture. Conductivity is measured and is reported below.

It is seen that ternary electrolyte compositions containing ionic liquid, solvent and protic acid exhibit excellent conductivity.

The electrolyte composition of 15.91 wt % acetic acid in 1:1 volume mixture of EMIM Ac/PC is tested in a cell as in Example 1. At the first cycle, the ternary electrolyte exhibits a reduced charge/discharge overpotential vs. 2M acetic acid in EMIM Ac. The ternary system exhibits a 0.33 V drop in charge voltage and increased discharge voltage plateau. The ternary system also has an increased coloumbic efficiency of 32.9% (13.14/40 mAh/g) vs. 21.2% 6.16/29 mAh/g) for the binary system.
