    "title": "Visible Discrimination of Broadband Infrared Light by Dye-Enhanced Upconversion in Lanthanide-Doped Nanocrystals",
    "date": "2014-01-01",
    "abstract": "Optical upconversion of near infrared light to visible light is an attractive way to capture the optical energy or optical information contained in low-energy photons that is otherwise lost to the human eye or to certain photodetectors and solar cells. Until the recent application of broadband absorbing optical antennas, upconversion efficiency in lanthanide-doped nanocrystals was limited by the weak, narrow atomic absorption of a handful of sensitizer elements. In this work, we extend the role of the optical antenna to provide false-color, visible discrimination between bands of infrared radiation. By pairing different optical antenna dyes to specific nanoparticle compositions, unique visible emission is associated with different bands of infrared excitation. In one material set, the peak emission was increased 10-fold, and the width of the spectral response was increased more than 10-fold.",

                "Optical upconversion is a multiphoton process by which two or more photons are sequentially absorbed, followed by emission of radiation at a shorter wavelength. This process has potential in several applications, including diode-laserpumped solid-state lasers [1,2], luminescent bioassays [3][4][5][6][7][8], next-generation lighting [9], enhanced photovoltaic response [10,11], and imaging applications to expand the effective spectral range of silicon-based detectors [12,13].",
                "Using the formalism proposed by Auzel [14], lanthanidedoped nanocrystals performing upconversion are defined as having three components: (1) the host material; (2) the sensitizing ion; and (3) an activator ion that emits the absorbed radiation at higher energy. The mechanism for upconversion of lanthanide (Ln 3+ )-doped nanocrystals is a probability-based event. The first step in this process is the absorption of a photon of energy, h] 1 , by the sensitizer ion (see Scheme 1, (1)). Scheme 1. Energy Transfer Processes:",

                "In contrast to the concerted absorption of photons in a harmonic generation process, upconversion is a sequential absorption process that can occur at relatively low optical power densities (1-10 3 W/cm 2 for upconversion versus 10 6 -10 9 W/cm 2 for second harmonic generation [15]). Because the f-f transitions of Ln 3+ ions are Laporte-forbidden [16,17], the first excited state of the various Ln 3+ ions (denoted Ln 3+ * ) has long lifetimes, up to the millisecond range [18]. This allows a high probability for the Ln 3+ * ion to absorb an additional photon (Scheme 1, (2)) and emit an upconverted photon (Scheme 1, (3)) before either nonradiative relaxation (Scheme 1, (4)) or radiative recombination occurs (Scheme 1, (5)). The downside is that these Laporte-forbidden transitions have low molar absorptivity coefficients (\ud835\udf00 \u223c 0.5-5 M -1 cm -1 ).",
                "The competing nonradiative relaxation (Scheme 1, (4)) can be reduced by incorporating the Ln 3+ ions into a nanoparticle to prevent interaction of the Ln 3+ ions with overtones of C-H and O-H stretching frequencies [19,20], provided that a low phonon energy host material is used [21][22][23]. With phonon energies of 350 cm -1 , 600 cm -1 , and 880 cm -1 , respectively [22], lanthanum-fluoride (LaF 3 ), yttrium-oxide (Y 2 O 3 ), and yttrium-orthovanadate (YVO 4 ) crystal lattices have been used for upconversion, but the vast majority of the results come from the sodium-yttriumtetrafluoride (NaYF 4 ) host material with its low phonon energy of 370 cm -1 [23]. Recently energy clustering at sublattice level has been shown to enhance the efficiency of upconversion [6].",
                "Although monochromatic quantum efficiency of 0.3% has been reported for upconversion in nanocrystalline NaYF 4 doped with ytterbium (Yb 3+ ) sensitizer and erbium (Er 3+ ) activator [24], the overall light capture efficiency of lanthanide-based upconverters is limited by the narrow spectral width and the low absorption cross-section of the atomic transitions. To address these issues, a dye acting as an optical antenna is placed on the surface of the nanocrystals to capture the incoming radiation more efficiently and to transfer that energy to the sensitizer ion. Ytterbium, the preferred sensitizing element for lanthanide upconversion, has an atomic absorption cross-section of 7 \u00d7 10 -5 L g -1 cm -1 [25] for the 2 F 7/2 \u2192 2 F 5/2 transition at 975 nm (10,300 cm -1 ) [16,17] and a peak having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of absorption of 10 nm. In contrast, an organic dye commonly has an absorption cross-section of 200-400 L g -1 cm -1 and an absorption FWHM of \u2265100 nm. Furthermore, the broad absorption width of the dye antenna and the sequential nature of the upconversion process mean that monochromatic light sources are not required.",
                "When the distance from the optical antenna to the nanoparticle is on the order of 5 nm, the energy of the light captured by the optical antenna can be transferred to the nanoparticle by F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a nonradiative mode of energy transfer proceeding via a short-range dipole-dipole interaction [26,27]. The optical antenna concept has been applied to dye-induced downconversion [15,27] and is the driving force for dyesensitized solar cells [28]. Recently, Zou et al. [25] applied the optical antenna concept to upconversion, reporting a dye-induced upconversion with an activation bandwidth of \u223c100 nm (versus <20 nm for direct atomic absorption) and a 1,100-fold increase in peak upconversion efficiency.",
                "In this work, we extend the function of the dye optical antenna to provide visible discrimination of infrared radiation. Optical antenna dyes with different infrared absorption and emission bands are coupled with specific rareearth-doped nanoparticles having both differing activation wavelengths and differing upconverted emission spectra. This results in upconverting materials having increased spectral width, a 10-fold increase in response, and a distinctive visible emission associated with different bands of otherwise invisible light [29]."

The solution under nitrogen atmosphere is heated to boiling at \u223c324 \u2218 C and maintained for \u223c20 minutes. After the solution is cooled naturally, nanocrystals are precipitated from the solution with ethanol, followed by centrifuging at 4000 RPM.

No upconversion was seen from the amorphous material or from the cubic phase material, which are the dominant phases for reaction temperatures less than 300 \u2218 C [30]. At reaction temperatures ranging from 300 \u2218 C to 324 \u2218 C, the desired hexagonal crystalline phase is formed, as is shown in the large-angle X-ray diffraction measurements of Supplemental Figure S1. Higher reaction temperature and longer reaction times increase the size of the nanoparticles, while the molar ratio of ligand (oleic acid) to lanthanide metals changes the ratio of the \ud835\udc50-axis to the \ud835\udc4eand \ud835\udc4f-axes of the hexagonal rodlike nanoparticles.

Figure 1 shows the variation of upconversion with particle size. Larger format renderings of the TEM images are provided in Section F of the Supporting Information. The HR-TEM images show the small (\u226412 nm) nanoparticles grown at 300 \u2218 C and the large (70 nm) particles grown at 315 \u2218 C. In both cases, the reaction time was 80 minutes. An Ostwald ripening process [36,37] causes the smaller, high-surfaceenergy particles to dissolve, allowing the material to regrow on established nanoparticles to create larger nanocrystals having lower energy states and reduced surface defects. Figure 1 shows that, for direct atomic excitation and with all other parameters being the same, the upconversion from the larger nanoparticles is 10 times greater than that of the smaller nanoparticles. For the upconversion by direct atomic absorption, larger particles are more efficient, due, in part, to the lesser ratio of surface sites (and surface defects) to interior volume. In the case of dye-induced upconversion, smaller nanoparticles are expected to be more efficient due to the short-range of the FRET mechanism (the F\u00f6rster distance for 50% drop in energy transfer efficiency is in the range of 2-6 nm [26]). For this study, a target particle size of 15 \u00d7 25 nm was selected, although no specific measurements of efficiency of dye-induce upconversion versus particle size were performed."

                        "Upconversion Spectra. The selection of lanthanide dopants and their loading levels is linked to the intended upconversion pathway. In its most common embodiment, the infrared upconversion in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles is initiated by the absorption of 975 nm light by the sensitizer ion Yb 3+ , followed by energy transfer and ladder-climbing in the manifold of states in the activator ions [5,14,23,25,30], such as erbium Er 3+ , holmium (Ho 3+ ), and thulium (Tm 3+ ). In the material systems where the sensitizer and activator are different ions, the doping level of the sensitizing ion (Yb 3+ ) is high for two reasons: first, to capture the incoming radiation, and second, to increase the probability of energy transfer from the Yb 3+ ion to the activator ions. On the other hand, the doping level of the activators is low to prevent self-absorption by the lanthanide-emitting elements [6,8] and to reduce the number of sites to which energy from the sensitizing ions is transferred, thereby increasing the probability of inducing multiple-photon transfer into the activator ions. In this study, the doping levels were 20-25% for Yb 3+ , 2% for Ho 3+ , 2.5% for Er 3+ , and 0.3% for Tm 3+ . Upconversion spectra for the 975 nm diode laser excitation of NaYF 4 nanoparticles doped with combinations of Yb 3+ :Tm 3+ , Yb 3+ :Ho 3+ , and Yb 3+ :Er 3+ are shown in Figure 2.",
                        "Additional sensitizing wavelengths besides 975 nm were required to demonstrate the discrimination of infrared light based on the absorption properties of the attached optical dye antenna. Er 3+ , Nd 3+ , and Ho 3+ ions have been shown to act as both the sensitizer and the activator [10,13,14,38,39], generating upconversion for excitation at discrete wavelengths from the visible spectrum to the NIR spectrum. Figure 3 shows the characteristic upconversion spectrum of erbium for the excitation of NaY 0.85 Er 0.15 F 4 at 801 nm, 975 nm, and 1550 nm. For this class of NaYF 4 nanoparticles in which the Er 3+ ion acts as both sensitizer and activator, the optimal doping level for Er 3+ is around 15% [38]. Although the 1550 nm excitation offers the largest spectral window for the dye antenna, the selection of available infrared-emitting dyes dictated the use of the 801 nm excitation for our study of dye-induced upconversion."

                        "The role of the optical antenna is the efficient capture of the incoming radiation and transfer of that energy to the sensitizer element in the nanoparticle. The optical requirements for the dye antenna are strong absorption in the infrared wavelength band of interest, high fluorescence efficiency at the sensitizer gateway wavelength (975 nm for Yb 3+ , 801 nm for Er 3+ ), fast energy transfer from the dye to the active ion, and transparency (no absorption) in the visible region. Although a number of commercially available dyes meet the optical requirements, there is only a sparse selection of dyes that also have the functional group needed to bond to the nanoparticle surface. Since the operative energy transfer mechanism, FRET, drops as the inverse of separation distance to the sixth power (1/\ud835\udc5f 6 ), it is crucial to make a short linkage between the donor (the optical antenna) and the receptor (the sensitizing element in the nanoparticle). We chose to make that tight linkage with a covalent amide bond that is formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid, an isothiocyanate, or an NHS ester functional group on the dye antennae with an amine group on the functionalized nanoparticle.

Although all three techniques yield the desired short separation distance between dye and nanoparticle, the strong covalent bond is best able to withstand subsequent processing steps. The amide covalent bond is formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid, isothiocyanate, or an NHS ester functional group on the as-purchased infrared dyes, with the surface amine group on the functionalized nanoparticles. The nanoparticle is functionalized by a surface silanization technique following a modification of the method of van Blaaderen and Vrij [31] for creating dye-doped silica spheres.",
                        "Surface silanization by the hydrolysis and condensation of siloxane monomers is a general technique for coating surfaces with silica and for imparting a surface functionalization by selecting siloxane monomers that contain the desired functional groups [4,15,32,33], in our case, an amine group. A thin functionalized silica shell is created by the condensation of a controlled amount of amine-functionalized siloxane monomers. Agglomeration of the nanoparticles during shell growth is reduced by the use of a reverse microemulsion [15,[32][33][34] process in which the size of the microemulsion is tailored to contain a single nanoparticle. Our initial goal was to minimize the distance from dye antenna to nanoparticle by first reacting the amine-functionalized siloxane monomers with the dye antenna, then condensing the covalently bonded dye-siloxane monomer onto the surface of the nanoparticle. In a second step, nonfunctionalized siloxane monomers are added to create a thicker encapsulating layer (see Supplemental Figure S3), thereby protecting the dye-antenna and creating an outer shell that can be later functionalized to promote dispersion of the nanoparticles into nanocomposite materials. This process has been demonstrated for several visible and NIR dyes [15,31,34], and was used in our initial test with the visible dye fluorescein-free acid (FlFA) to measure the efficiency of FRET in the more traditional case of energy flow from excited nanoparticles to the attached fluorescent dye (see Supplemental Figure S7). Unfortunately, the infrared dyes used in this study were not robust to the highly basic conditions of siloxane condensation. A modified dye-attach procedure was adopted in which the nanoparticles first undergo the base-catalyzed condensation to form a thin amine-functionalized silica shell. The thinly encapsulated particles are purified and then allowed to react with the dye under milder conditions. Drawbacks of the modified process are that it leaves the dye exposed on Figure 5: TEM image NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ , Tm 3+ nanoparticles with nominal 12 nm thick silica shell ((a); scale bar is 50 nm). TEM image NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ , Ho 3+ nanoparticles with a thinner silica shell estimated to be 2 nm or less ((b); scale bar is 20 nm). In both cases, the silica shell includes the attached infrared dye, which is not discernible in the TEM image.",

The TEM image in Figure 5(b), is typical of the aminefunctionalized, silica-coated particles used in this study, namely, hexagonal particles sized 25 \u00b1 5 nm and 15 \u00b1 5 (long and short axis, resp.). The silica shell contains the dye antenna, but neither the silica shell nor the dye that is attached to the outside of the shell is discernible in this TEM image.",
                        "The particles in Figure 5(a), have the additional nonfunctionalized silica shell mentioned above which encapsulates the inner amine-functionalized shell and the attached dye.",
                        "In the TEM image of Figure 5(a), and the end-on view in Supplemental Figure S3, the thick silica shell (nominal 12 nm thickness) appears light gray and featureless. The thinner silica shell in Figure 5(b), is not discernible in the TEM images (larger format renderings of the TEM images are provided in Section F of the Supporting Information). The presence of the silica shell is however known from the FTIR measurements. The shell thickness is estimated to be 2 nm or less. The estimate is based on geometric calculations starting with the 12 nm shell thickness on the nanoparticles of Figure 5(a), and factoring in the 100-fold lower ratio of silane reagent to nanoparticles for the reaction in Figure 5(b), and the approximately 15x lower surface area of those smaller particles. In a future experiment, the shell thickness could be better estimated by creating a series of encapsulated nanoparticles using a range of ratios of silane reagent to nanoparticles. The thickness of the resulting silica shell would be measured on the TEM for the progressively thinner shells. At some point, the silica shell will no longer be discernible in the TEM, but a plot of measured thickness versus silane reagent could be extrapolated to the conditions used in our target materials.",
                        "The TEM images of the as-sensitized nanoparticles show crisp hexagonal-shaped rods with a strong tendency for selfassembly on the TEM grid (see Supplemental Figure S2), while the silica-coated particles show rounded contours and reduced tendency for self-assembly (Figure 5).

The curves in plots (a) and (b) have a sharp feature at 801 nm and 819 nm, respectively, due to leakage of the laser light. No such feature is seen in the curves of plots (c) and (d) because an infrared blocking colored glass filter was inserted to block the scattered laser light. The same filter also reduces the intensity of emission at 645 nm. Plot (d) in Figure 7 is the reference, that is, excitation at 975 nm where Yb 3+ absorbs ( 2 F 7/2 \u2192 2 F 5/2 ), but where the dye does not. Since the DY-831 dye does not absorb at 975 nm, similar upconversion was expected for the dye-attached nanoparticle and for the control, but results showed a 10-fold reduction of upconversion for the dye-attached particles. The hypothesis is that a residual absorption by dye in the region of 975 nm could result in a deactivation of the excited state of the Yb 3+ sensitizer, thus decreasing the overall upconversion efficiency.

The scanning knifeedge results shown in Figure 9(d), indicates a 0.33 mm and 0.51 mm FWHM respectively for the vertical and horizontal directions of this free-space diode laser. Depending on the operating temperature and the drive current, this diode laser exhibits either a single longitudinal mode (a single, narrowwidth wavelength) or two to three longitudinal modes, that is, multiple spectral lines. Because of the narrow width of the atomic absorption of erbium near 801 nm, the wavelength of the diode laser is temperature-tuned to achieve the maximum upconverted signal from the same amount of measured continuous-wave laser power. Wavelengths vary from 800.8 nm at 15 \u2218 C to 806.4 nm at 35 \u2218 C, equivalent to 0.28 nm per degree Celsius.

Upconverted power is measured as the integrated area under the curve from 520 nm to 570 nm. Curve fitting shows a near two-photon power dependence. As stated earlier, the different excitation wavelengths are generated by manually swapping and collimating discrete   diode laser. During the measurements in Figure 10, the beam size was not measured by the lengthy scanning knife-edge technique, hence the decision to plot the data as a function of measured continuous-wave laser power. Assuming that the beam sizes on target were the same as shown in Figure 9(d), the estimated power density in Figure 10 would be 11 W/cm 2 and 60 W/cm 2 for 20 mW and 100 mW, respectively. The power dependence of the dye-induced upconversion indicates a two-photon process, similar to the power dependence for direct atomic excitation. Estimated quantum efficiency is less than 10 -4 , well below the values reported by Zou et al. [25]. One explanation for the reduced efficiency is the larger separation between dye and nanoparticle caused by our modified dye-attach process that was necessitated by the chemical fragility of the dye molecules. Taken together, this data is a clear indication that energy transfer from the dye is the source of the upconverted signal. Demonstration of dye-induced upconversion was done with four discrete diode lasers, but it should be possible with any wavelength in the absorption band of the dye. Within the constraints of the discrete excitation wavelengths, the data also show that the two material sets have different responses depending on the wavelength of the incoming infrared excitation, and that they produce spectrally different visible emissions."

                "In summary, dye-induced upconversion was demonstrated for two nanocomposite systems with different optical antenna and different lanthanide-based upconversion pathways. Infrared fluorescing dyes were closely bound to the nanoparticles and acted as efficient light-harvesting optical antennae for the upconversion process in lanthanidedoped NaYF 4 . The different upconversion pathways emanate from two different activation wavelengths: 801 nm for Er 3+ in the NaYF 4 :Er 3+ system and 975 nm for the Yb 3+ sensitizer in codoped NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ , Ln 3+ (Ln = Ho, Tm, Er, etc.). Discrimination of different bands of infrared light radiation was demonstrated by specific pairing of dye antennae having different infrared absorption bands with nanoparticles having both different activation wavelengths and visibly different upconverted emission. Practical applications of this technique include extending the wavelength range of silicon solar cells [10,11] and providing a visible laser threat warning [29]. Individual diode lasers were used to demonstrate dyeinduced upconversion at four discrete wavelengths. Similar results are expected for any wavelength in the absorption band of the dye. In the preferred configuration, the dye optical antenna provided a greater than 10-fold increase of effective spectral width for upconversion, and a 10-fold increase in the monochromatic upconversion efficiencies, as compared to upconversion by direct atomic absorption."
