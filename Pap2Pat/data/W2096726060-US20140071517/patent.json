                        "Optical upconversion is a process in which a material absorbs two or more photons of lower energy and emits a single photon of higher energy. For example, two infrared photons may be absorbed followed by the emission of a single visible photon. Upconversion is fundamentally different, and far more challenging, than the more common process of down-conversion where a single high energy photon is absorbed followed by the emission of lower energy photons.",
                        "Upconversion is desirable in many applications because it can make accessible the optical energy or optical information contained in low energy photons that is otherwise not available to the human eye or to certain classes of photoelectric devices.",
                        "Known optical upconversion materials include rare earth doped materials. Such materials, however, are sensitive only at specific wavelengths having a very narrow bandwidth. Another challenge of making such materials practically useful is their low absorption probability. Given the limitations in the state of the art, it would be a valuable advance in the field to provide improved optical upconversion materials."

                        "The present invention provides for the first time a material exhibiting optical upconversion using an optical antenna (e.g., dye, pigment or nanoparticle) bonded to a transition-metal doped nanocrystal. The nanocrystal itself is small enough not to induce Mie or Rayleigh scattering, essentially rendering the nanomaterial \u2018invisible\u2019. The advantages of such dye-induced upconversion include the capacity to provide sensitivity to broad-band absorption of light which contrasts to prior material systems limited to the discrete, narrow atomic transitions of the sensitizer ions for upconversion. Another advantage is very large absorption probability and resulting performance compared with known systems. Yet another advantage of the present invention is that it provides the means of differentiating incoming light through the use of various combinations of dyes and dopant materials.",
                        "The optical materials of the present invention have many applications including solar cell applications where they may be used to harvest light in the infrared at wavelengths below the bandgap of the solar cell material (typically silicon) and enhance performance of silicon-based photovoltaic systems through the addition of a layer above or below the silicon photovoltaic material. In a related application, the optical materials may be used to extend into the infrared the spectra sensitivity of (low cost) silicon detectors such as used in cameras or other imaging detector arrays used to gather image information about a scene by subsequent signal processing. Yet another application is the use of the optical materials of the present invention in laser threat warning systems, such as thin film optical materials providing visible-to-the-naked-eye indication of presence of infrared laser light, e.g., \u201cfalse colors\u201d associated with different laser wavelengths (i.e., source recognition) or simple brightness/intensity indication. Another application is the use as a covert marker that may be used for brand protection and identification. Such applications may be embodied as a clear (visible transparent) film that does not distort the viewer's vision.",

The nanocrystal includes a transition metal-doped material exhibiting upconversion to optical wavelengths.

The optical upconverting nanomaterial has at least one linear dimension (e.g., width or thickness) that is less than 150 nm in extent.",

Preferably, the energy transfer facilitating/emitter dopants have a concentration range of 0.5-30 mol %, or, more preferably 10-30 mol %, or most preferably 15-25 mol %.",

In this case, an emission spectrum of the energy transfer facilitator overlaps with an absorption spectrum of the emitter. The energy transfer facilitating transition metal dopants, for example, may be Yb3+ or Er3+, and the emitter transition metal dopants may be Er3+, Ho3+, or Tm3+. Preferably, the energy transfer facilitating transition metal dopants have a concentration 5-20 times greater than a concentration of the emitter transition metal dopants. For example, the energy transfer facilitating transition metal dopants may have a concentration range of 5-30 mol %, or more preferably 15-25 mol %, and the emitter transition metal dopants have a concentration range of 0.01-10 mol %, or more preferably 0.3-5 mol %, or most preferably 1-3 mol %.",

                        "As summarized in a recent review article by Wang an Liu [J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2009, 38, pp 976-989), upconversion has been demonstrated in numerous nanocrystalline materials, including NaYF4, LaF3, Y2O3, YVO4, etc, which were synthesized using a range of synthetic procedures, including coprecipation, thermal decomposition, sol-gel processing, etc. Here, for purposes of illustration, we describe the synthetic method used to create the lanthanide doped nanoparticle material which was used in one embodiment of the invention. NaYF4 (sodium yttrium tetrafluoride) nanocrystals were synthesized following a modification of Zhang's procedure (Li, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Shuter, B.; Idris, N. Langmuir Lett., 2009, 25, 12015.). The acetate salts of the desired lanthanide elements were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. or from Strem Chemical Inc. and used without further purification. This synthesis technique may be used with any lanthanide element. The chloride and nitrate salts may also be used for this synthesis technique. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.",
                        "The acetate salts of the lanthanide elements were combined in stoichiometric ratios to yield a total of 1 mmol of lanthanide ion, to which was added 1 mmol of sodium acetate. The lanthanide salts and sodium acetate were mixed with 4 mL oleic acid and 11 mL of 1-octadecene in a 50 mL round bottom flask, heated under vacuum to 120\u00b0 C. to form a clear solution before cooling to room temperature. A separate solution of ammonium fluoride (NH4F) was made by dissolving 4 mmol of NH4F in 10 mL of methanol. This was added to the original reaction mixture which resulted in the immediate formation of a white-colored precipitate. The reaction solution was stirred for 30 minutes and then slowly heated to evaporate the methanol. The solution was then degassed by bubbling nitrogen through the solution at 100\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. The temperature of the solution was brought to a boil (\u02dc324\u00b0 C.) for 5-15 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature. The nanocrystals were obtained by precipitating them through the addition of ethanol and centrifuging the liquid at 4000 rpm. The nanocrystal purification was performed by dispersal of the nanocrystals in toluene or cyclohexane and precipitation with a 2\u00d7 volume to volume ratio of ethanol to nanocrystal solution, followed by centrifugation.",
                        "A high resolution transmission electron microscope of the purified nanocrystals shows highly uniform hexagonal rod-shaped nanoparticles which grow in both length and width with increased temperature and growth time. An electron diffraction pattern of a single nanoparticle confirms a well-defined hexagonal crystalline structure. An X-ray diffraction pattern confirms that the angular positions of the diffraction peaks match that of the JCPDS 28-1192 standard, although the relative amplitudes are different. This difference is attributed to preferential alignment through self-assembly of the hexagonal rods of the measured sample.",

The techniques described below adapt these techniques for the optical antenna application in order to ensure a very short linkage (separation distance) because of the short interaction range of the FRET or Dexter transfer. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the following techniques for attaching anntennas to the nanocrystals can be readily adapted to attach any of various types of optical antennas, whether directly or indirectly via a chain linker, as well as to attach multiple distinct types of antennas to a single nanocrystal."

The nanoparticle/PEG/MMA solution is mixed at ratio of 1 part to 2.5 with the PMMA casting solution.
