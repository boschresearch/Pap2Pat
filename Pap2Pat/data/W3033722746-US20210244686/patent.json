                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The non-psychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome (Commissioner), and has been proposed as a treatment for nephrotoxicity, colitis, cancer, neuroinflammation, cardiomyopathies, and diabetic complications. Although preclinical data for several other therapeutic applications of CBD exist, relatively little is known about the biochemical mechanism of action of CBD in cells, tissues, and organs. Indeed, its molecular mechanism of action (MoA) is not well understood relative to its psychoactive structural isomer tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The molecular targets responsible for the proposed pharmacological effects of CBD have also remained largely unknown. Proposed targets include voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), G protein-coupled receptor 55, and CaV3.x, but substantial evidence is outstanding to significantly support the claims that the observed clinical therapeutic effects of CBD for epilepsy or other diseases originates from these targets.",
                        "One consensus across the field is that CBD does not target CB1 or CB2, as is the case for THC. Thus, the accumulating clinical data to support the therapeutic potential of CBD has outpaced the efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlay these effects, in part due to barriers imposed by the classification of CBD as a schedule I drug under the US Controlled Substances Act. A commercial formulation of CBD, Epidiolex\u00ae, was recently classified as a schedule V drug, facilitating research efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of CBD towards identifying direct target(s).",
                        "Despite the legal hurdled that have accompanied CBD research in the past several previous studies have broadly examined the large-scale effects of CBD in cultured cells. For instance, transcriptomics has been used to determine that CBD alters both metal ion and cholesterol homeostasis in microglial cells. Another recent study reported that CBD-induced apoptosis in two human neuroblastoma cell lines could be inhibited by co-treatment with serotonin and vanilloid receptor antagonists, and showed a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, highlighting the potential pleiotropic effects from CBD exposure. Although these studies have advanced the understanding of CBD, they have not produced a consistent model of the MoA of CBD that explains the apparent pleiotropic cellular effects and clinical therapeutic effects that have been shown and are currently under investigation. Indeed, as the MoA is better understood, it opens the possibility for additional therapeutic uses of CBD and its analogs. For example, a clearer understanding of the CBD's MoA may allow it to be directed to the treatment of various cholesterol-related disease conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD).",
                        "CVD are the major cause of death and disability in the United States and other industrialized countries despite recent declines in CVD mortality rates. They account for more deaths annually than any other disease, including all forms of cancer combined. In the USA more than 1 million heart attacks occur each year and more than half a million people still die as a result. This enormous toll has focused attention on the possible prevention of CVD by various means, especially through lowering of plasma cholesterol levels. It is now well established that elevated total cholesterol and in particular low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in plasma plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. Clinical trials have demonstrated clearly that decreasing cholesterol concentrations in plasma can contribute to primary and secondary prevention of coronary events and mortality. Some studies have estimated a 2% reduction in risk of a coronary artery event by a 1% reduction of total serum cholesterol.",
                        "To combat CVD, and other cholesterol-related conditions, certain pharmaceutical compounds have been developed to modulate cholesterol levels in a patient. For example, compositions that inhibit the cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis, can lower blood serum cholesterol by slowing down the production of cholesterol. It is believed that inhibition of HIMG-CoA reductase results in a reduction in hepatic cholesterol synthesis and intracellular cholesterol stores, a compensatory increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and a subsequent enhanced removal of LDL-cholesterol from plasma. Potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase include for example the compounds referred to as statins, which family comprises atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin. However, statins are not without limitations. For example, statins can cause type 2 diabetes or higher blood sugar, confusion and memory loss, as well as liver, muscle and/or kidney damage. Accordingly, there exists a need for novel treatment methods of CVD, and other cholesterol-related conditions.",
                        "As demonstrated below, the present inventors have identified the key biochemical effectors of CBD in human cells using a broad search strategy employing transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and live cell microscopy. The inventors discovered thousands of CBD dependent molecular changes within cells that highlighted a central theme around cholesterol homeostasis. In addition, the present inventors discovered that CBD incorporates into the plasma membrane and not only triggers transport and storage of cholesterol to lipid droplets, but also may cause blockage of cholesterol biosynthesis in the final step of the biosynthetic pathway. The inventors additionally found that CBD can affect lipid order by altering the orientation of cholesterol within synthetic and cell derived membrane models. The inventor's study demonstrates that the observed downstream effects of CBD on cholesterol homeostasis are triggered by the lipid order effects of CBD at the plasma membrane. This model challenges the previous models for the CBD MoA, as it proposes that cholesterol may be the primary pharmacological effector rather than any given protein receptor. Based on this new and unexpected understanding, the present inventors may more effectively employ CBD, and its analogs, in the treatment of cholesterol-related diseases, such as CVD among others."

                        "The present invention demonstrates the successful use of a multi-omic method to produce a data driven model for the MoA of CBD. The inventor's multidisciplinary approach revealed mechanistic components in the CBD MoA to be concentrated in cholesterol homeostasis in cells. Specifically, this disclosure details the exact molecular features of cholesterol homeostasis that are altered, including intracellular transport, storage, and biosynthesis.",
                        "The inventors further provide evidence that the origin of these effects is CBD's direct effect on cholesterol and lipid order. Within cells, lipid ordered domains (also referred to as lipid rafts) are 10-120 nm wide transient domains in membrane structures where tight packing of cholesterol, sphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins allow for activation of signaling cascades via the increased proximity of specific proteins. These ordered domains have been implicated in generating receptor signaling, assembly of endocytic machinery and endocytosis, and regulation of ion channels. In one embodiment, the present inventor demonstrate that CBD incorporates into the plasma membrane and affects cholesterol orientation and lateral diffusion in membrane model systems and cell derived endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. This effect initiates the vast amount of downstream effects of CBD, which include cholesterol dependent apoptosis, increased cholesterol storage and trafficking, and multiple effects on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Altogether, the inventor's multi-omic study concludes that cholesterol is a major effector of CBD, which may explain the diverse clinical applications for CBD proposed in previous studies, where membrane cholesterol plays a widespread underappreciated role in disease progression.",

Even so, the following detailed description should not be construed to unduly limit the present disclosure, as modifications and variations in the embodiments herein discussed may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the present discoveries.",
                        "In one embodiment, the inventive technology demonstrates a multi-omics approach that provides an intrinsic cross-validation of CBD's ability to disrupt cholesterol homeostasis. Specifically, the present inventors have employed a strategy to integrate transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics as a comprehensive tool to identify the biochemical components in the MoA of CBD in cells and further demonstrated consistent evidence that CBD disrupts cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Multiple aspects of cholesterol related cellular processes proved to be perturbed, including cholesterol biosynthesis (FIGS. 2D, 3B), transport (FIGS. 2D, 5E,F), and storage (FIGS. 4 A-G). All three-omics methods provided evidence for perturbed cholesterol biosynthesis. For instance, transcriptomics and proteomics reported transcriptional activation and protein accumulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol, HMG-CR (FIG. 2D). Increased HMG-CR protein production is a canonical response to decreased cholesterol levels in the ER, where cholesterol is sensed through the SREBP-SCAP axis. Consistent with this observation, the present inventors found within the CBD response that metabolic precursors of cholesterol are accumulating (FIGS. 3B, 11A) and total cholesterol production is decreasing (FIGS. 3B, 11A, 11B), demonstrating that the last step in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is inhibited. Thus, in one preferred embodiment, CBD may trigger the sensing of low cholesterol via SREBP-SCAP processing, inhibition of the DHCR7/24 enzymatic step of cholesterol biosynthesis, and activation cholesterol esterification/storage, all within the ER.",
                        "In one embodiment, the inventive technology demonstrates that CBD incorporates into cellular membranes and increases lipid order. Despite multiple lines of evidence in preclinical studies of CBD outlining a wide array of phenotypic effects, very little evidence has emerged to substantiate how these effects originate. The present inventor's data using PC:Chol SUVs shows that CBD incorporation into SUVs causes increased accessibility of cholesterol to cholesterol oxidase, presumably through tight packing of cholesterol, CBD and possibly PC (FIG. 6B). This result is surprising and totally unexpected because it suggests that CBD can induce ordered domains in the complete absence of sphingolipids, which are historically used in formulations of model membranes for studying lipid order. Nevertheless, the present inventors detected the same behavior of cholesterol in CBD treated ER membranes derived from subcellular fractionation of living cells (FIGS. 6 B, F), which demonstrates that this ordering effect can also occur in membranes of complex composition. Consistent with CBD's ability to constrain the cholesterol orientation and packing, the present inventors demonstrate that fluorescent cholesterol displays diminished lateral diffusion in response to CBD exposure to synthetic membranes, and that this affect opposes and can be reversed by the poly-unsaturated lipid DHA (FIGS. 6 G-I). Since diminished lateral diffusion of lipids has can be a hallmark of increased lipid order, this data represents evidence for CBD induced order in membranes. Additionally, the opposing effect between CBD and DHA on model membranes was recapitulated in living cells in an opposing effect on apoptosis (FIGS. 7 B, C), which strengthens the inventive technology's findings that CBD can affect the lipid order in cholesterol containing membranes in living cells.",
                        "The present inventors subcellular fractionation enabled a determination that CBD incorporates primarily into the plasma membrane of cells and to a lesser degree the membranes of the ER and the nuclear envelope (FIG. 6A), demonstrating that CBD itself may be trafficked with other cellular membrane components. Previous studies show that internalization of the plasma membrane through endocytosis is heavily dependent on the formation of ordered lipid domains, within which the protein machinery that mediates membrane curvature and vesicle pinching is assembled. This role for ordered lipid domains in endocytosis has been shown for both caveolin and clathrin-mediated pathways and can explain how the lipid ordering effect of CBD would result in increased intracellular transport of cholesterol from the plasma membrane.",
                        "In another embodiment, the inventive technology demonstrates that CBD dependent activation of lipid order causes downstream effects on cholesterol subcellular distribution, storage, and biosynthesis. An initial survey of cellular components affected by CBD using proteomics and transcriptomics yielded a surprisingly large number of affected components known to be involved in a fairly diverse array of biochemical pathways and cellular process, including translation, mitochondrial function and Cajal function (FIG. 2 D). These data and biosensor profiling data (FIG. 10) indicate the potential that either CBD has a diverse number of drug targets, or the CBD drug target itself interacts with many downstream pathways and processes, where in particular CBD's ability to influence cholesterol is an upstream effect in the CBD response.",
                        "As highlighted above, the apoptotic effect of CBD is heavily dependent on cellular cholesterol levels (FIGS. 5 A-D) suggesting a role for cholesterol in the upstream response. Additional lines of evidence revealed that CBD enhances the flux of fluorescent cholesterol through the lysosomal compartment (FIG. 5F), on its way to being stored in lipid droplets (FIGS. 4A, E-F). This flux of cholesterol was also shown to be related to CBD's ability to affect cellular apoptosis, as pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol export from the lysosome or inhibition of cholesterol esterification causes massive apoptotic responses in CBD treated cells but has no detectable effect on control cells (FIG. 5 E). This synergistic effect between inhibitors of cholesterol trafficking/storage and CBD could be greatly enhanced by additional treatment of 25-hydroxy cholesterol, supporting the model that CBD increases trafficking and storage of cholesterol in lipid droplets as a pro-survival response. Indeed, the key event that initiates apoptosis in conditions in which the inventor's observe CBD dependent cell death may be accumulation of cholesterol in either the ER or lysosome, where cholesterol is maintained at relatively low levels. Lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol has been demonstrated in previous studies to be a potent upstream trigger of apoptosis.",
                        "Additional embodiments demonstrate that the increased cholesterol transport from the lysosome to the ER can explain why biosynthesis of cholesterol is inhibited in the final steps catalyzed by DHCR24/DHCR7 via product inhibition of DHCR24 and DHCR7, which is known to occur for DHCR7. As lipid order has been a strong modulator of this endocytic flux of cholesterol containing vesicles in a multitude of previous studies, the present inventions shows that CBD's pharmacological effect on lipid order is the primary initiator of the observed homeostatic shift in cholesterol maintenance in CBD treated cells. Taken together, embodiments of the data demonstrate that endocytic flux of plasma membrane cholesterol is upstream of CBD's ability to activate cholesterol transport through the lysosome to the ER and lipid droplets, as well as CBD's ability to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis.",
                        "In another embodiment, the inventive technology demonstrates that the effects on cholesterol homeostasis explain CBD's broad therapeutic ability and predict potential risks in CBD use. The invention identifies key mechanistic components in the CBD response, classifies those components into broad biological processes, and identifies CBD as an efficient modulator of lipid order from which the downstream effects originate. This insight of CBD MoA through lipid order modulation has broad implications on clarifying the mechanistic origins of the clinical effects of CBD in a wide array of diseases. CBD has been painted as a panacea in the supplement industry. Indeed, many of the diseases where CBD is implicated as a therapeutic are known to engage transmembrane proteins that have functions reported to be modulated through ordered lipid domain processes. Thus, the reported panacea like of CBD parallels the importance of cholesterol mediated processes within the progression of these diseases.",

Examples, may include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), and even to the cognitive deficits typical of the old age. Such increases of lipid-order may include increasing the number and/or integrity of lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are portions of the plasma membrane that contain nano/micro-domains that are enriched in cholesterol. These rafts are thought to represent highly dynamic structures dispersed throughout the membrane of cells that recruit downstream signaling molecules upon activation by external or internal signals. Rafts also contain a high amount of sphingomyelin, which is enriched in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, indicating that some trans-bilayer translocation must occur to form and stabilize these domains. In neurons, membrane rafts have been detected at synapses, where they are thought to contribute to pre- and postsynaptic function. In another example, lipid rafts promote interaction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the secretase (BACE-1) responsible for generation of the amyloid \u03b2 peptide, A\u03b2. Rafts also regulate cholinergic signaling as well as acetylcholinesterase and A\u03b2 interaction. In addition, such major lipid raft components as cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside have been directly implicated in pathogenesis of the disease. Perturbation of lipid raft integrity can also affect various signaling pathways leading to cellular death and AD. Moreover, it has been shown that the autophagic-lysosomal pathway is aberrant in Alzheimer's disease brain. However, lipid rafts that mediate amyloid precursor protein can disturb autophagy, thus blocking the autophagic-lysosomal pathway and aggravating the disease. Therefore, we speculate that in Alzheimer's disease, lipid rafts play an important role in blocking the autophagic-lysosomal pathway of amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid-beta degradation, thereby exacerbating the progression of this disease. In one embodiment, increasing lipid-order may also include increasing the number and/or integrity of lipid raft in a cell membrane. Increasing \u201clipid order\u201d may further alter the constituency and/or components of the order domain in the cell membrane.",

The goal of this combined multi-omics approach is to lessen the bias in identifying components in a given drug's MoA via comprehensive quantification of drug specific perturbations to proteins, small molecules, and gene expression within cells. This technique was applied to gain insight into the biochemical MoA of CBD (structure depicted in FIG. 1A) in human cells in culture.",
                                "To efficiently design the multi-omics experiments, the present inventors exposed the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2) to escalating doses of CBD at 24, 48, and 72 hours and determined the EC50 of toxicity of CBD to be greatest at 72 hours and at an approximate concentration of 20 \u03bcM (FIG. 1 B). To maximize the efficient use of the inventor's multi-omic resources, a large dose and time survey of the CBD response was conducted in a panel of transgenic SK-N-BE(2) and HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines, each expressing a genetically encoded f\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor gene capable of reporting the activity of a cellular effector molecule/activity including, but not limited to: AMP kinase activity, Erk kinase activity, cytosolic ATP, glucose, lactate, pyruvate & glutamine, Ca2+ in the ER & Cytosol, mTor kinase activity & TACE protease activity. The full list of biosensors and their literature source, each being incorporated herein by reference, is displayed in Table 1. The biosensor activity profiles as a function of CBD dose and time (FIGS. 9A-C) were analyzed for the EC50 of each biosensor activity at each time (FIG. 10). The result of these efforts outlined that the most robust dose of CBD for use in multi-omic experiments is 20 \u03bcM and that the kinetic profile of the CBD response begins in hours and persists for days. Altogether, this information was used to design the multi-omic experiment detailed in FIGS. 1 C and D. In addition, the widespread effects of CBD on the biosensor activities throughout the panel served as an early indication that CBD causes modulation of all biochemical pathways that were probed, suggesting that the CBD response may originate from a pleiotropic source.",

                                "In the proteomics arm of the multi-omic workflow, proteins that undergo robust drug dependent changes in either abundance or subcellular localization are identified. To achieve this goal, the present inventors developed a novel subcellular fractionation method schematically displayed in FIG. 2A and described in detail in the material and methods example below. Briefly, cells are collected, washed, and then lysed using mild detergent, exposed to two rounds of phase separation by centrifugation to isolate insoluble from soluble lysate components. This fractionation method was implemented over more traditional methods using Dounce homogenization because of the improved ability to efficiently process large numbers of samples in a high throughput manner. Similar methods of partitioning complex lysates using phase separation have been used in other studies and are commonly referred to as \u201cdifferential solubility fractionation.\u201d Peptides derived from each fraction from cells exposed to either vehicle or 20 \u03bcM CBD were analyzed for each time point and the sum of total events across all time points for each fraction was determined for both detected events (FIG. 2B, right chart) and CBD responsive events (FIG. 2B, left chart). The frequency of CBD responsive events detected in each fraction as a function of time indicates that each fraction contains proteins responsive to CBD treatment, as well as a relatively slow biochemical mechanism (hours to days) in the overall CBD drug response (FIG. 2C) that was consistent with CBD kinetics observed in the inventor's biosensor profiling experiments (FIG. 10). The relative CBD dependent effects on filtered protein identifications (FDR<1%) are tabulated for each fraction and time-point in FIG. 2D.",
                                "In order to compare and contrast proteomic derived mechanistic components of the CBD response to that of transcriptomic components, the present inventors additionally performed RNAseq analysis of SK-N-BE(2) cells exposed to vehicle or 20 \u03bcM CBD at the time-points indicated in FIG. 1C. 5,643 differentially expressed genes were identified in the CBD response gene with a FDR<1%, which was further reduced to a list of 139 genes with an LFC>=1. Differentially expressed transcript identifications that overlap with differentially regulated protein identifications from our proteomics experiments were included in the table displayed in FIG. 2D. FIG. 2D additionally displays the enriched biological processes for CBD responsive mechanistic components from these experiments, which include Translation, ER stress response, Metal Ion Response, and Cholesterol Biosynthesis. While most of these annotations are supported by either the transcriptome or the proteome, dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism is supported by both. Furthermore, 42 of the 150 proteins displayed in FIG. 2D have known roles in cholesterol import (i.e. APO-E and LDLR), cholesterol biosynthesis (i.e. SQLE and HMG-CR), or phospholipid catabolism (i.e. ENPP2). As a result of the agreement between proteomic and transcriptomic data, we focused our study thereafter on determining the role of cholesterol homeostasis in the CBD drug response.",
                                "**Example 7: Metabolomics Reveals CBD Dependent Inhibition of Cholesterol Biosynthesis**",
                                "Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed a widespread and concerted CBD-induced perturbation of cholesterol biosynthesis, trafficking and sensing. These findings raise the question of whether CBD treatment leads to alterations in lipid and cholesterol metabolism (the latter pathway depicted in FIG. 3A). The present inventors used mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, a subset of metabolomics, to quantify the effect of CBD on the fluxes of key lipids and sterols. Vehicle and CBD exposed cells were fed 13C labeled glucose for 24 hours and harvested using methanol extraction and mass spectrometry analysis. Cholesterol biosynthesis was analyzed by determining the level of incorporation of 13C into biosynthetic intermediates. The total and isotopically-labeled levels of virtually all cholesterol precursors were found to accumulate in CBD exposed cells, while labeled and total cholesterol itself was found to decrease in CBD exposed cells (FIGS. 3B, 11A). The effect of CBD on total cellular cholesterol was confirmed using a fluorogenic assay for cholesterol in an orthogonal experiment (FIG. 11B). The transcriptional activation of HMG-CR (FIG. 2D) combined with the increase in abundance of labelled cholesterol precursors (FIG. 3B) argues that the SREPB/SCAP cholesterol sensors in the ER have activated the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in response to CBD.",
                                "To further investigate the role of SREBP/SCAP signaling in the CBD response, the present inventors used western blot analysis to probe whether SREBP2 proteolytic processing is affected by CBD. As shown in FIG. 3C by the increase in SREBP2 cleavage products (designated I for Intermediate and M for Mature), CBD exposure to cells causes dose dependent activation of SREBP2 cleavage. This activation is significant but is lower in magnitude than that of the pharmacological activators of SREBP2 cleavage, U18666A or Atorvastatin. The present inventors performed this assay with cells grown in LDL containing FBS (elevated cholesterol) and LDL depleted FBS (cholesterol starved). Surprisingly, CBD dose-dependent SREBP2 cleavage occurred both in cholesterol starved conditions and in elevated cholesterol conditions (FIG. 3C), suggesting that CBD can trigger transcriptional activation of cholesterol biosynthesis through SREBP processing even in cholesterol starved conditions. These data provide multiple lines of independent evidence that CBD transcriptionally promotes cholesterol biosynthetic genes and their activity, which is well known to be triggered by low amounts of cholesterol in the ER. However, the inventors also detect evidence that although cholesterol precursors are accumulating in a CBD dependent manner, cholesterol itself appears to experience a net decrease in de novo synthesis. This is evident in the overall decrease in newly synthesized 13C labeled cholesterol in CBD treated cells (FIG. 3B) and implies an apparent blockage in the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by either DHCR24 or DHCR7 in the ER.",

                                "Elevated cholesterol storage via esterification may explain our observation of decreased cholesterol biosynthesis, which was observed in the metabolic flux experiments described above (FIG. 3B). To investigate the effect of CBD on cholesterol storage, the present inventors performed follow up experiments to determine the total cellular amounts of small molecule markers of cholesterol storage as a function of CBD exposure. The inventors detected accumulation of multiple species of cholesteryl esters with diverse chain length and degree of unsaturation in the acyl chain (FIG. 4A). Despite significantly higher levels of cholesteryl esters in CBD-treated cells, 13C labeled cholesteryl esters were not detected. The CBD-dependent increases in total unlabeled amounts of cholesteryl esters that we were able to detect suggest that cholesterol storage via cholesterol esterification is activated in the CBD response.",
                                "Since this esterification requires acyl CoA reactants, the inventors surveyed our dataset for evidence of fatty acid utilization. It was found that CBD treated cells display reduced free fatty acid levels (FIG. 4B), as well as accumulation of free phospholipid head-groups (FIG. 4C), including phospho-ethanolamine, a product of sphingosine catabolism via the enzyme S1P lyase. These data suggest that both free and S1P lyase generated fatty acids are likely utilized for cholesterol esterification.",
                                "The present inventors additionally surveyed the cellular abundance of all detectable species of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in cell extracts and found a variety of phospholipids that display reduced abundance in CBD treated vs vehicle treated cells (FIG. 4D), which is consistent with previous studies showing catabolic breakdown of phospholipids upstream of S1P lyase activity. Thus, the present inventors found multiple lines of evidence consistent with activation of cholesterol esterification in the CBD response. To further support the claim that CBD elicits cholesterol storage, the present inventors used live cell confocal microscopy of SK-N-BE(2) cells stained with both fluorescent cholesterol (22-NBD-Cholesterol) and the lipid droplet dye nile red (FIG. 4E) to quantify the number and size of lipid droplets. CBD increases the average abundance of lipid droplets (FIG. 4F) but does not affect lipid droplet size (FIG. 4G). Altogether, these combined experiments highlight that the CBD response in cells includes activation of cholesterol esterification and storage.",

                                "In order to shed light on the phenotypic implications of CBD disruption of cholesterol homeostasis, the present inventors sought to identify a critical phenotypic effect of CBD that is likely to result from altered cholesterol homeostasis. Earlier experiments described above indicated that high doses (>40 \u03bcM) of CBD can induce cell death after 24 hours (FIG. 1B). As a result, the inventors asked whether this cell death was related to cholesterol homeostasis.",
                                "To accurately measure cellular apoptosis over time, the present inventors performed live cell microscopy experiments with cells loaded with both DNA and caspase 3/7 dyes, which enables continuous and precise quantification of apoptosis at the single cell level. Populations of SK-N-BE(2) cells exposed to increasing concentrations of CBD in the presence or absence of the HMG-CR inhibitor atorvastatin were analyzed for their percentage of apoptotic cells. The toxic effect of high CBD doses at 15 hours was found to be dramatically reduced by simultaneous exposure of CBD and atorvastatin, compared to CBD exposure alone (FIGS. 5A, 12A-B). This ability of inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis to protect cells from CBD induced apoptosis was far more pronounced in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, which was analyzed in the same manner as SK-N-BE(2) cells (FIGS. 5B, 12C-D). These data suggest that the cholesterol status of cells can greatly influence whether CBD causes apoptosis in both cell lines tested.",
                                "The inventors further tested this hypothesis by repeating our cellular apoptosis analyses in SK-N-BE(2) cells exposed to increasing concentrations of extracellular 25-hydroxy cholesterol in the presence of vehicle or constant CBD exposure. 25-hydroxy cholesterol is used here over cholesterol exposure because of its improved solubility, which circumvents the need for complex sterol delivery proteins. Similar to cholesterol, 25-hydroxy cholesterol has been shown to traffic efficiently to the ER and inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis via the SREBP/SCAP signaling axis. CBD exposed cells show a clear dose dependent sensitivity to 25-hydroxy cholesterol induced apoptosis (FIGS. 5C, 12E-F), which was more dramatically observed in HaCaT cells (FIGS. 5D, 12G-H). These data are consistent with our atorvastatin experiments, as both experiments suggest that CBD causes apoptosis in conditions where cells have high cholesterol/hydroxycholesterol.",
                                "In order to gain further insight into the sensitivity of CBD treated cells to 25-hydroxy cholesterol, the present inventors repeated the apoptosis assay in SK-N-BE(2) and HEK293T cells with combinatorial 25-hydroxy cholesterol/CBD stimulation using sublethal doses of 25-hydroxy cholesterol (15 \u03bcg/ml) and CBD (20 \u03bcM) in the presence or absence of either the chemical inhibitor of cholesterol transport (U18666A, 10 \u03bcM) or cholesterol storage (VULM 1457, 5 \u03bcM). Inhibition of cholesterol transport or cholesterol storage can each restore the apoptotic response of cells to combinatorial 25-hydroxy cholesterol/CBD treatment (FIGS. 5E, 12I-L), indicating that cholesterol transport and cholesterol storage are prosurvival in the CBD response.",
                                "One possible explanation for why CBD sensitizes cells to inhibitors of cholesterol trafficking and storage is that CBD increases the flux of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the lysosome-ER transport pathway. When this flux is activated and hydroxy cholesterol is supplied in excess, the inability to efficiently store cholesterol may cause subcellular accumulation of cholesterol/hydroxycholesterol in organelles that normally maintain low cholesterol levels. To test this hypothesis, the inventor's repeated the live cell confocal microscopy experiments with SK-N-BE(2) cells stained with fluorescent cholesterol (NBD-cholesterol) and the lysosome dye lysotracker. Fluorescent cholesterol accumulates in labeled lysosomes after 24 hours only in the presence of the NPC1 inhibitor U18666A and CBD stimulation (FIG. 5F). This evidence demonstrates that CBD does indeed increase the flux of cholesterol through the lysosome and supports the hypothesis that CBD activates the intracellular transport of cholesterol. This data agrees with the present inventor's previous observations of CBD induced cholesterol esterification and storage (FIGS. 2 D, 3 A, 3 E-F), which occurs in the ER and lipid droplets, respectively. Altogether, these data outline a model where CBD triggers the plasma membrane to lipid droplet transport of cholesterol, which passes through the lysosome in route to the ER.",

As a result, the inventors designed and executed a subcellular fractionation method to isolate nuclear membrane, plasma membrane, and ER membrane fractions. The present inventors found that CBD is concentrated mostly at the plasma membrane at 24 hrs, although a detectable amount of CBD incorporates into ER and nuclear membranes (FIG. 6A).",
                                "To further understand why CBD can induce cholesterol transport and storage, the present inventors tested the hypothesis that CBD might affect cholesterol directly. Using synthetic small unilamellular vesicles (SUVs) containing purified phosphatidyl choline (PC) and cholesterol, the inventors measured the relative ability of cholesterol to be converted to 5-cholesten-3-one by the enzyme cholesterol oxidase using a commercially available fluorogenic assay. Titration of CBD to cholesterol containing SUVs yields an increase in the reaction rate of cholesterol oxidase (FIG. 6B), but the same effect is not observed when this assay is repeated with SUVs that contain no cholesterol (FIG. 13). The same effect is also not observed when this experiment is repeated with cholesterol complexed with methyl beta cyclodextrin (MBCD) in solution (FIG. 6C) or with free soluble 25 hydroxy cholesterol (FIG. 6D). These data suggest that cholesterol is inside the membrane environment for CBD to affect the rate of enzymatic activity of cholesterol oxidase, implying that CBD increases the accessibility, or orientation, of cholesterol to cholesterol oxidase.",
                                "To validate that the same effect of CBD on cholesterol orientation can be observed in membranes with complex composition, the present inventors used a subcellular fractionation protocol to isolate ER membranes, which were found to be intact vesicles visualized using confocal microscopy and ER-tracker red staining (FIG. 5E). Using these vesicles as a cholesterol source yields identical results to SUVs in the cholesterol oxidase reaction rate experiments when exposed to increasing doses of CBD (FIG. 6F). Together, these data provide compelling evidence that CBD incorporates into membrane environments and alters cholesterol orientation such that the hydroxyl moiety of cholesterol is more solvent accessible.",
                                "CBD's ability to affect cholesterol orientation in both synthetic and cell derived ER membranes implies that CBD may contribute to increased lipid order. The ability of cholesterol oxidase assays to reveal alterations in lipid order has been previously reported in studies noting that cholesterol oxidase can preferentially target caveolar domains, which are ordered lipid domains. Another hallmark of lipid order is a decrease in lateral diffusion of lipids. As a result, the present inventors aimed to measure CBD's ability to perturb the lateral diffusion of fluorescently labelled cholesterol (NBD-cholesterol) in synthetic membranes. The present inventors deposited PC SUVs containing 20% moles of cholesterol and 2% moles NBD-cholesterol on glass-bottom multi-well imaging plates, followed by ultra-sonification to construct fluorescently labelled membrane monolayers. Using these monolayers and confocal microscopy, the inventor's performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to measure the kinetics of recovery of fluorescent cholesterol. CBD significantly reduced FRAP kinetics (FIGS. 6G, H), suggesting that CBD slows the lateral diffusion of fluorescent cholesterol. This effect of CBD on lateral diffusion could be rescued with simultaneous treatment with the lipid disordering agent DHA (FIGS. 6G, I). There are two proposed models for how DHA affects cholesterol in membranes. In one model, DHA incorporates into highly disordered domains and excludes cholesterol, thus increasing partitioning of lipid ordered and disordered domains. The other proposed model is that DHA enters cholesterol rich domains and disrupts cholesterol packing. Both of these opposing models are supported by NMR experiments, but the latter model is favored by the observation that polyunsaturated fatty acids partition into detergent resistant membranes, implying that DHA associates with cholesterol rich domains. Consistent with this latter model, FRAP data suggests that DHA increases disorder within cholesterol containing domains resulting in an increase in the lateral diffusion of fluorescent cholesterol. As a result, the inventors concluded that the opposing effect of DHA and CBD on lateral fluorescent cholesterol diffusion supports CBD incorporation into membranes increases lipid order.",

                                "FRAP experiments reveal that DHA and CBD have opposing effects on the lateral diffusion of fluorescently labelled cholesterol in synthetic membranes. Although this implies that CBD increases lipid order and that DHA decreases lipid order, it remains unclear how relevant these biophysical effects of CBD and DHA are to cellular physiology. As a result, the present inventors sought to determine whether CBD and DHA have opposing effects on cells. To this end, the present inventors repeated the live cell apoptosis assays in cells exposed to increasing doses of DHA to determine how DHA affects cell death. The present inventors found that relatively low doses of DHA induce apoptosis in both HEK293T and SK-N-BE(2) cells (FIGS. 7A, B), which is consistent with previous studies. This DHA induced apoptosis is cholesterol dependent, as simultaneous treatment of DHA and the cholesterol sequestering agent MBCD can delay apoptosis in HEK293T cells and completely cancel apoptosis in SK-N-BE(2) cells (FIGS. 7 C, D). Since high doses of CBD also induce apoptosis (FIGS. 5A, B), we investigated whether low doses of CBD could counteract the apoptotic induction of DHA. To our surprise, CBD treatment can completely cancel the apoptotic effects of DHA in both HEK293T and SK-N-BE(2) cells (FIGS. 7 C, D). These data not only support the claim that CBD and DHA have opposing mechanisms of action to elicit cellular apoptosis, but also support the claim that these competing effects rely on the cholesterol content of cellular membranes.",

This separation was performed so that a protein could be missing from one and/or two series due to stochastic effects in data-dependent acquisition and the overall trend could still be inferred, though with reduced resolution. The 11th label in each series was devoted to a global mix reference channel, which would be present in all series for a given cellular fraction. The global mix is a cell-fraction specific mixture that contains an equal portion from each time point sample. This channel was the denominator in the intermediate ratiometric measurement for differential expression for both drug-treated samples and time-matched controls. This mixture channel was constructed so that every measurable protein observed at any time point has a non-zero denominator when ratios are taken.

The TMT 11-plex reporter ion spectrum peaks for each peptide contributes to the inference of the differential expression of a protein and reporter ion label. In this case, each reporter ion label represents a particular measured time point. The label-to-label normalization is handled via a hierarchical model, which calculates the bias inherent with each specific label by pooling differential expression estimates from all proteins, changing and unchanging. The hierarchical model are solved computationally with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, running chains in parallel for faster results. The MCMC returns a Gaussian posterior probability distribution of loge differential expression for each protein for each label. The model initially fits ratiometric differential expression for every treatment and matched control relative to a global mix channel, and the reported drug-induced differential expression is the difference (in loge space) between the treated sample and the matched control sample. Five MCMC chains were run independently for at least 500k steps, and convergences for each run were verified via Gelman-Rubin convergence variable <1.05.",

For reporting a single differential expression for a protein and label, the Bayesian updating procedure is used to produce a single posterior distribution, from which a mean point estimate and 95% credible interval are calculated. In some specific instances, labels represent technical rather than biological replicates. In cases of technical replicates, the point estimate values were averaged and the credible intervals extents were treated as errors and added in quadrature.
