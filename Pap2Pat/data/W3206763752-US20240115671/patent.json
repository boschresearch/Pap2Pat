                        "Cancer is generally characterized by an uncontrolled and invasive growth of cells. These cells may spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Conventional anticancer therapies, consisting of surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can be effective for some cancers/patients; however, they are not effective for many cancer sufferers. Thus, further medical treatments are needed.",
                        "The role of bacteria as an anticancer agent has been recognized for over 100 years, and many genera of bacteria, including Clostridium, Bifidus, and Salmonella, have been shown to preferentially accumulate in tumor tissue and cause regression.",
                        "The use of Salmonella typhimurium to treat solid tumors began with the development of a nonpathogenic strain, VNP20009. Well-tolerated in mice and humans, this strain has been shown to preferentially accumulate (>2000-fold) in tumors over the liver, spleen, lung, heart and skin, retarding tumor growth between 38-79%, and prolonging survival of tumor-bearing mice. In initial clinical trials, S. typhimurium was found to be tolerated at high dose and able to effectively colonize human tumors."

                        "Engineered, non-pathogenic Salmonella selectively colonize tumors one thousand-fold more than any other organ, invade and deliver therapies cytosolically into cancer cells making the bacteria ideal delivery vehicles for cancer therapy. It is herein demonstrated that controlling the activity of flhDC and subsequent flagellar expression in engineered Salmonella enables intracellular protein delivery selectively in tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. The expression of flhDC/flagella is controlled to enable both colonization of tumors and invasion into cancer cells for the purposes of intracellular protein and therapeutic delivery. Flagella are needed for cell invasion into cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, flagellar expression of Salmonella in the bloodstream and/or in systemic circulation causes rapid clearance and significantly reduces tumor colonization. As a result, an inducible version of flhDC was genetically engineered into an engineered strain of Salmonella lacking a native version of the transcription factor (alternatively, the endogenous promoter for flhDC can replaced with an inducible promoter). The inducible system allowed for tight expression control of flhDC within the therapeutic strain. Salmonella lacking the ability to express flhDC colonized tumors with greater selectivity than a parental control strain. Inducing expression of flhDC by administration of \u2018remote controlling\u2019, with, for example, arabinose in an arabinose inducible system, within intratumoral, engineered Salmonella enabled intracellular invasion and protein delivery into tumor cells.",
                        "Herein is described Salmonella containing and method to control flagellar expression through external means (e.g., a small molecule inducible genetic circuit or inducible expression system) in such a way that engineered strains of Salmonella do not express flagellin systemically. Once the bacteria have colonized tumors to optimal levels, then a \u2018remote control\u2019/inducible strategy is employed where a small molecule is used to induce expression of flagella and the type 3 secretion system by activating expression of a recombinant and/or inducible version of the motility regulator, flhDC.",
                        "Another aspect provides for the deletion of the SseJ gene in a Salmonella delivery strain. This gene constricts the location of the Salmonella to the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), increasing the delivery potential of the strain. This can be in combination with/without the previously described control of delivery.",

A novel therapeutic platform for controlled colonization and/or invasion of engineered Salmonella in cancer cells and controlled gene and protein delivery in cancer cells, and therefore treatment for cancer, is provided herein.",

Genetic circuits were engineered that force entry into cancer cells and release proteins from the endosome into the cytoplasm. Intracellular lysis makes the platform self-limiting and reduces the possibility of unwanted infection. Delivered nanobodies and protein interactors (NIPP1) bind to their targets and cause cell death. Delivery of caspase-3 to mice reduces growth of breast tumors and eliminates liver tumors. Intracellular delivery of protein-based drugs to tumors opens up the entire proteome for treatment."

Thus, a nonnaturally-occurring nucleic acid is considered to be exogenous to a host once in the host. It is important to note that non-naturally occurring nucleic acids can contain nucleic acid subsequences or fragments of nucleic acid sequences that are found in nature provided the nucleic acid as a whole does not exist in nature. For example, a nucleic acid molecule containing a genomic DNA sequence within an expression vector is non-naturally occurring nucleic acid, and thus is exogenous to a host cell once introduced into the host, since that nucleic acid molecule as a whole (genomic DNA plus vector DNA) does not exist in nature. Thus, any vector, autonomously replicating plasmid, or virus (e.g., retrovirus, adenovirus, or herpes virus) that as a whole does not exist in nature is considered to be non-naturally occurring nucleic acid. It follows that genomic DNA fragments produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease treatment as well as cDNAs are considered to be non-naturally occurring nucleic acid since they exist as separate molecules not found in nature. An exogenous sequence may therefore be integrated into the genome of the host. It also follows that any nucleic acid containing a promoter sequence and polypeptide-encoding sequence (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) in an arrangement not found in nature is non-naturally occurring nucleic acid.

Thus, two nucleic acids are complementary to each other when a substantial number (at least 50%) of corresponding positions in each of the molecules are occupied by nucleotides which normally base pair with each other (e.g., A:T and G:C nucleotide pairs).

In one aspect, it is greater than 10 nucleotides in length. siRNA also refers to a single transcript which has both the sense and complementary antisense sequences from the target gene, e.g., a hairpin. siRNA further includes any form of dsRNA (proteolytically cleaved products of larger dsRNA, partially purified RNA, essentially pure RNA, synthetic RNA, recombinantly produced RNA) as well as altered RNA that differs from naturally occurring RNA by the addition, deletion, substitution, and/or alteration of one or more nucleotides.",

For example, if a ligand is specific for binding pocket \u201cA,\u201d in a reaction containing labeled peptide ligand \u201cA\u201d (such as an isolated phage displayed peptide or isolated synthetic peptide) and unlabeled \u201cA\u201d in the presence of a protein comprising a binding pocket A the unlabeled peptide ligand will reduce the amount of labeled peptide ligand bound to the binding partner, in other words a competitive binding assay.",

For example, it can be a known standard agent or compound which is administered and used for comparing results when administering a test compound, or it can be a standard parameter or function which is measured to obtain a control value when measuring an effect of an agent or compound on a parameter or function. Standard can also refer to an \u201cinternal standard\u201d, such as an agent or compound which is added at known amounts to a sample and is useful in determining such things as purification or recovery rates when a sample is processed or subjected to purification or extraction procedures before a marker of interest is measured. Internal standards are often a purified marker of interest which has been labeled, such as with a radioactive isotope, allowing it to be distinguished from an endogenous marker.",

This deletion diminishes the TNF immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and prevents septic shock. In another embodiment, it also has a partial deletion of the purI gene. This deletion makes the bacteria dependent on external sources of purines and speeds clearance from non-cancerous tissues (13). In mice, the virulence (LD50) of the therapeutic strain is 10,000-fold less than wild-type Salmonella (72, 73). In pre-clinical trials, attenuated Salmonella has been administered systemically into mice and dogs without toxic side effects (17, 27). Two FDA-approved phase I clinical trials have been performed and showed that this therapeutic strain can be safely administered to patients (20). In one embodiment, the strain of bacteria is VNP20009, a derivative strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Deletion of two of its genes\u2014msbB and purI\u2014resulted in its complete attenuation (by preventing toxic shock in animal hosts) and dependence on external sources of purine for survival. This dependence renders the organism incapable of replicating in normal tissue such as the liver or spleen, but still capable of growing in tumors where purine is available.",

More than 60% of the pathways that control cellular function are intracellular (1) and almost all are difficult to access. Intracellular pathways control most of the hallmarks of cancer (2) and have been the focus of a significant fraction of cancer research. Because of their specificity, protein biologics are excellent candidates for interfering with these pathways. However, bringing functional proteins across the cell membrane is technically challenging. Effective intracellular delivery, coupled with specific protein drugs, has the potential to provide new treatments for previously incurable cancers.",

In the intestines, Salmonella have a partially intracellular lifestyle. To evade clearance, Salmonella invade epithelial cells using the proteins expressed by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) (3,4). After invasion, Salmonella reside in early and late endosomes, which they reform into Salmonella containing vacuoles (SCVs) by expressing the genes of pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) (5-7). SCVs enable intracellular survival (5,8) and protect the Salmonella from intracellular defense mechanisms (9,10). A step in the activation of SPI2 genes, is the sensing of the endosomal environment. These sensing mechanisms, which are unique to Salmonella, are needed for delivery of proteins into cells.",
                                "While it is well established that Salmonella invade intestinal cells (4,11), their location within tumors is more uncertain, despite extensive documentation of tumor colonization (12-16). Preferential accumulation and exponential growth in tumors are essential properties of therapeutic Salmonella (17,18). When administered in culture, Salmonella readily invade into carcinoma cells (FIG. 1B). To determine where they reside in tumors, Salmonella with a fluorescent intracellular reporter were injected into tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. In these tumors, over 70% of Salmonella were intracellular (P<0.001, n=5, FIG. 1C), demonstrating their suitability as delivery vehicles. In cells dissociated from tumors with collagenase, bacteria were present in carcinoma, immune, and other tumor associated cells (FIG. 1D).",
                                "The development of therapeutic Salmonella into an intracellular protein delivery system had three steps (FIG. 1A). The design goals were to engineer Salmonella to (1) Make a drug, (2) Invade into cells, and (3) Release the drug into cells. The use of bacteria changes what is traditionally meant by \u201cdelivery.\u201d Unlike typical delivery vehicles, bacteria manufacture protein drugs at the disease site (19), delivering exponentially more molecules than were originally present in the injected bacteria. Chronologically, the first steps were to generate a platform strain with controlled invasion and release. The last step was to transform this platform strain with genes to synthesize different protein drugs. In the final engineered strains of Intracellular Delivering (ID) Salmonella, each of these three processes (make, invade and release) was controlled by a specialized genetic circuit.",
                                "In this system, invasion of ID Salmonella into cells is controlled with the regulation factor flhDC(FIG. 1E-G). Expression of flhDC is required for Salmonella to invade cancer cells (FIG. 1E). When flhDC is not expressed, Salmonella invaded less than 2% of cells, which was 54 times less than by Salmonella with re-expressed flhDC (84%; P<0.001; FIG. 1E). Invasion is dependent on flhDC because it regulates the production of flagella and the type III secretion system (20). In microfluidic tumor masses in vitro (21), re-expression of flhDC increased cell invasion and colonization 53 times (P<0.01, FIG. 1F). In tumors, re-expression of flhDC increased invasion into both carcinoma and immune cells (P<0.05, FIG. 1G).",
                                "The second component of ID Salmonella, release, required development of a system to trigger autonomous lysis after cell invasion (FIG. 2). This goal was achieved by identifying a Salmonella promoter that is triggered intracellularly and not extracellularly. After invasion into cells, the genes of SPI2 activate to form Salmonella containing vacuoles (SCVs) (8). When coupled to a GFP reporter, the promoters of two SPI2-associated genes, PsseJ and PsifA, both activate after invasion into cancer cells (FIG. 2A, left). However, the extracellular expression of PsseJ is 5.8 times less than PsifA (P<0.001, FIG. 2A), indicating that it is more sensitive to cell invasion.",
                                "To release a synthesized protein cargo, the bacteria must lyse after invasion. Triggered expression of Lysin gene E (LysE) from bacteriophage DX1174 causes rapid bacterial death (FIG. 2B). Salmonella, with the coupled PsseJ-LysE construct and that constitutively expresses GFP (as a model protein drug), lysed after invasion into cancer cells (FIG. 2C), and discharged GFP into the cytoplasm (FIG. 2D). Bacterial lysis occurs for 10 hours after invasion (FIG. 2E). The basal expression of Lysin E by the PsseJ-LysE circuit does not affect bacterial health and intracellular induction activated the system at near to its maximum rate (FIG. 2F). Each bacterium can deliver, on average, 163,000 GFP molecules (FIG. 2G).",
                                "After bacterial lysis, delivered protein escapes SCVs and fills the cellular cytoplasm (FIG. 2H-I). This escape is important because, immediately after invasion, most Salmonella reside within SCVs (FIG. 2H, left). When ID Salmonella lyse, clusters of released GFP protein are contained within SCVs (FIG. 2H, middle). Over time, the protein escapes the SCVs and fills the entire cytoplasm (FIG. 2I), a transition that occurs for most cells (P<0.001, FIG. 2H, right). GFP diffuses through the cytoplasm with an effective diffusivity of 0.15 \u03bcm2/min (FIG. 2J).",
                                "As designed, bacterial lysis is dependent on residence within SCVs (FIG. 3A-B). After invasion, some ID Salmonella escape into the cytoplasm and are not surrounded by a SCV membrane (FIG. 3A, left). More than 95% of GFP released from Salmonella originated inside SCVs (P<0.001; FIG. 3A, right). After invasion into cancer cells, ID Salmonella with a \u0394sifA deletion, which are predominantly cytoplasmic (23), did not lyse despite containing the PsseJ-LysE construct. Comparatively, ID Salmonella with a \u0394sseJ, which are predominantly vacuolar (24), almost all lysed (P<0.001, FIG. 3B). Without these deletions, most ID Salmonella localized to SCVs, lysed and delivered protein (P<0.001, FIG. 3B). This dependence indicates that the Pssej promoter only activates after SCV localization and not when in the cytoplasm. This specific sensing of the SCV environment is a feature exclusive to Salmonella.",
                                "Protein delivery was dependent on the two engineered systems, PBAD-flhDC for invasion and PsseJ-LysE for release (FIG. 3C). Salmonella without flhDC expression did not invade cells, and Salmonella without Pssei-LysE did not release the GFP cargo (FIGS. 3C&S2). Compared to controls, the presence of both systems increased protein delivery 548 times (P<0.001; FIG. 3C).",
                                "When administered systemically to tumor-bearing mice, ID Salmonella specifically deliver protein to tumor cells, and this delivery is dependent on flhDC (FIG. 3D-F). ID Salmonella invaded cells and delivered GFP that filled the cellular cytoplasm (FIG. 3D). This system delivered 60 t 12 \u03bcg GFP/g tumor (FIG. 3E), which is equivalent to 1.5\u00d7108 bacteria per gram of tumor. No GFP was detected in the livers or spleens of any mice (FIG. 3E). When tumor-bearing mice were administered ID Salmonella that did not express flhDC, little GFP was delivered (FIG. 3F). Re-expressing flhDC increased the percentage of cells that received GFP more than five times (P<0.001).",
                                "Delivery of proteins with ID Salmonella is safe and self-limiting (FIG. 3G). After intravenous administration, the tumor density of ID Salmonella reached a peak at 72 h and then dropped 97% in 11 days (FIG. 3E). The decline in density, which was caused by intracellular lysis, limits the exposure to therapy and increases safety compared to non-lysing Salmonella. After administration to healthy, tumor-free mice, ID Salmonella did not accumulate in lungs, hearts, kidneys or brains; had no effect on liver function; and caused no adverse immune responses.",
                                "To demonstrate its broad capabilities, ID Salmonella was engineered to make three different proteins (FIG. 4) that affect intracellular physiology: a nanobody (anti-actin), a protein inhibitor (NIPP1-CD), and an endogenous protein (CT casp-3). The central domain of nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP1-CD) removes PP1 from its holoenzymes and induces cell death (25). Constitutive two-chain active caspase-3 (CT Casp-3) is an engineered active form of caspase-3, the dominant executioner caspase that leads to apoptotic cell death (26, 27).",
                                "In one aspect, a bicistronic mRNA codes for caspase, with, for example, the large subunit followed by a ribosomal binding site and the small subunit on, for example, PBAD inducible promoter.",
                                "After bacterial delivery via invasion and lysis, the anti-actin nanobody was bound to cellular actin (FIG. 4A), demonstrating specific targeting of an intracellular protein. As potential therapeutic proteins, delivery of both NIPP1-CD and CT Casp-3 caused more cell death than controls (P<0.001; FIG. 4B, left). Induced death was dependent on invasion and protein delivery (FIG. 4B, right). When administered to microfluidic tumors devices, ID Salmonella delivering NIPP1-CD (P<0.05) and CT Casp-3 (P<0.01) caused cell death that increased with time as bacteria invaded the tumor masses (FIG. 4C).",
                                "Delivery of CT Casp-3 was effective against both liver cancer and triple-negative breast cancer in mice (FIG. 4D-E). After 14 days of treatment, delivery to BALB/c mice reduced the volume of 4T1 mammary tumors two times more than controls (P<0.05, FIG. 4D). Administration of ID Salmonella with CT Casp-3 significantly reduced the volume of liver Hepa 1-6 tumors in C57L/J mice (P<0.001; FIG. 4E, left) and reduced tumor growth rate 28 times (P<0.05; FIG. 4E, middle), which is equivalent to an increase in doubling time from 5 to 148 days. Tumor volume reduced in two mice for over 50 days, and survival increased significantly compared to bacterial controls (P<0.05, FIG. 4E right). Treatment with CT Casp-3 completely eliminated the tumor from one mouse, which was disease free for over 124 days.",
                                "**Conclusion**",
                                "Described herein is an autonomous, intracellular Salmonella vehicle that efficiently delivers properly folded and active proteins into cells. This bacterial strain is safe, eliminates tumors and increases survival. The engineered gene circuits produce protein drugs, cause hyper-invasion (flhDC) and trigger bacterial lysis after cell invasion. Because the system is autonomous, it does not require intervention and is self-timing. Protein delivery is triggered at the most opportune time for individual bacteria, ensuring that proteins are deposited inside cells and not in the extracellular environment. The accumulation of ID Salmonella in different cell types in tumors (FIGS. 1D&G), suggests that this system could be used to deliver proteins to non-cancerous tumor-associated cells, e.g., macrophages or endothelial cells.",
                                "Coupled together, two essential qualities of ID Salmonella enable the use of protein drugs that are currently not feasible. Intracellular Salmonella delivery (1) transports intact, functional proteins across the cell membrane; and preferential tumor accumulation (2) maintains safety for protein drugs that would act broadly against healthy cells. Both NIPP1-CD and CT Casp-3 have exclusively intracellular targets and would be toxic if delivered systemically. The specific accumulation of ID Salmonella eliminates these problems by focusing therapy specifically on the intracellular environment of tumors (FIGS. 1C and 3E).",
                                "The use of ID Salmonella to deliver CT Casp-3 can address the need for an effective treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). No curative treatment currently exists for the 840,000 patients who are diagnosed with HCC annually (28, 29). Current therapies have toxic side effects and only modestly increase survival (29-31). Treatment with CT Casp-3 ID Salmonella can be curative (FIG. 4E) and is safer. Inclusion of the PsseJ-LysE circuit makes ID Salmonella self-limiting. The delivery bacteria lyse after cell invasion (FIG. 3F), reducing the possibility of unwanted infections.",
                                "Delivery with ID Salmonella enables targeting of inaccessible cancer pathways and will accelerate the generation of new cancer therapies. These therapies can be created by coding the genes for specific protein drugs into Salmonella expression cassettes. Nanobodies (FIG. 4A) can be designed that specifically inhibit pathways necessary for cancer survival and progression. Using bacteria to deliver proteins into cells will expand the number of accessible pathways, open up many targets across the soluble proteome for treatment, and increase the efficacy and safety of cancer treatment."

                                "Intracellularly targeted, macromolecular therapies present an opportunity for treatment of cancer. The mammalian proteome consists of 60% intracellular protein while only 30% are surface associated and extracellularly exposed (1). However, macromolecules face tumor specificity, distribution, cell internalization and endosomal release barriers (2). An improved drug delivery system is needed to circumvent these delivery limitations and increase therapeutic efficacy of intracellularly active therapies. Salmonella are ideally suited for tumor selective intracellular protein delivery. Salmonella colonize tumors with high specificity, invade, and deliver protein therapies selectively inside tumor cells. Herein the discovery that flhDC expression is crucial for protein delivery into tumor cells with Salmonella has been reported. To this end, it was sought to determine the mechanisms by which flhDC expression enables intracellular therapeutic delivery in vivo. The unique mechanisms by which engineered Salmonella expressing flhDC developed resistance to intracellular therapeutic delivery was also assessed. Understanding these mechanisms help create improved tumor targeted, intracellular delivery strains of Salmonella.",
                                "Typhoidal strains of Salmonella that systemically infect humans carefully modulate flagellar expression in vivo. The typhoidal bacteria that disseminate systemically infect humans implement genetic programs to downregulate expression of the flagellar synthesis regulator (3-5), flhDC, in the blood (6, 7). One reason for this is because flagellin is a TLR5/NLRC4 agonist that strongly activates an anti-microbial immune response (8, 9). However, in tumor tissue, intracellular invasion and delivery into cancer cells requires activation of the Salmonella transcription factor, flhDC (10). Therefore, developing a method to control flhDC activity in engineered Salmonella is necessary to enable high levels of therapeutic delivery in tumors.",
                                "Modulation of flhDC activity within Salmonella has significant implications in determining tumor selectivity and reducing systemic virulence. Unlike tumors, clearance organs like the liver and spleen, have high concentrations of functional immune cells that mount strong responses upon pathogenic insult. The liver is a vital clearance organ and an essential site specific for immune mediated Salmonella clearance (11). The motility regulator, flhDC, regulates flagellar expression but is also a broad regulator of Salmonella lifestyle and virulence (10, 12, 13). Flagellar expression within Salmonella in macrophages or epithelial cells causes excessive, NLRC4 inflammasome dependent, pyroptosis. Salmonella hijack this inflammatory pathway to overexaggerate the anti-microbial response both in macrophages and within the gut, causing immune dysfunction (14, 15). Since the liver contains large quantities of Kupfer cells, flagellated Salmonella can cause significant pyroptosis in these liver specific macrophages. While pyroptosis is required in limited quantities to eliminate pathogens, flagellated Salmonella cause high levels of pyroptosis that render the anti-microbial immune response dysfunctional (14, 16). Macrophages are more effective at clearing Salmonella expressing lower levels of flhDC due to reduced flagellar expression, limited pyroptosis resulting in less immune dysfunction (16). Since tumors do not share the same level of immune function, low flagellin expression does not affect tumor colonization (17).",
                                "Upon invasion into a cell, there are two existing mechanisms by which therapy is delivered into the cytosol by Salmonella: (1) The bacteria invade, escape the intracellular vacuole, rupture, and deliver therapy into the cytosol (18-20) or (2) the bacteria are genetically engineered to lyse and deliver therapy from within the Salmonella containing vacuole into the cytosol. Several variants of cytosolic bacteria (\u0394sifA Salmonella, Listeriolysin O expressing bacteria) have been used for therapeutic delivery into tumor cells (18-20). In scenario (1), therapeutic delivery would require the bacteria to reside in the cytoplasm of a cancer cell and lyse spontaneously without any control. This mechanism would depend on ubiquitin dependent degradation (21) of the bacteria and subsequent cytosolic release of the therapy. In addition, cytoplasmic pathogens are known to strongly activate NF-kB signaling and initiate innate immune responses to clear the bacteria (9, 21, 22). Therefore, a high presence of cytosolic Salmonella is detrimental for immune evasion.",
                                "Salmonella have evolved to reside within an intracellular vacuole which confers protection to the bacteria inside cells (23, 24). The bacteria modify the vacuole to confer protection against degradation and clearance (25, 26). In addition, vacuolar residence seems to be especially important for bacteria in systemic circulation as demonstrated by Salmonella Typhi. The spi-2 protein, SseJ, is required for Salmonella to escape the SCV (27). Salmonella Typhimurium, which express SseJ, are localized to the gastrointestinal tract in humans (28). Salmonella Typhi, which lacks SseJ (29), is efficient at escaping the gastrointestinal tract into systemic circulation (30). Moreover, Salmonella Typhi only expresses typhoid toxin intracellularly within the SCV (31, 32). These critical between Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Typhimurium suggest that vacuolar residence is imperative to increase bacterial fitness in vivo.",
                                "Understanding the dynamics between vacuolar and cytosolic Salmonella expressing flhDC will aid in engineering an intracellular delivery strain of Salmonella. Herein we have shown that intracellular lysis of engineered Salmonella occurs in a vacuole. However, flagellated, intracellular Salmonella have a significant cytosolic presence (12). Intracellular Invasion is driven by flhDC and T3SS1 activity (10, 12, 33-35). Upon invading cells, Salmonella heavily modify the vacuoles in which they reside (24, 36). In doing so, some bacteria rupture the vacuole and escape (37, 38). Normally, the intravacuolar bacteria also downregulate flagellar expression through ssrB directed suppression of flhDC (39) (the ssrB protein is considered a master regulator of SPI-2 expression (33)). However, flagellated, cytosolic Salmonella have abrogated T3SS2 activity due to vacuolar escape (12). As shown herein, T3SS2 activity is needed to enable intracellular lysis and delivery of protein with therapeutic Salmonella.",
                                "Provided herein is a showing of how controlled expression of flhDC could improve tumor colonization and therapeutic delivery in vivo as compared to existing delivery strategies. Further the mechanism is eluicidated of flhDC induced resistance to therapeutic delivery and a genetic engineering strategy to rescue therapeutic delivery of the Salmonella strain. It was hypothesized that flhDC expression selectively within intratumoral bacteria is important for increasing tumor specificity, colonization and protein delivery to a spatially distributed set of tumor cells. It was further hypothesized that engineered Salmonella inducibly expressing flhDC could deliver more protein intracellularly compared to exclusively cytosolic Salmonella. It was also hypothesized that flhDC activity enabled lysis resistance in engineered Salmonella but could be rescued. To test these hypotheses, cell-based assays, tumor-on-a-chip models, and in vivo experiments were employed to quantitatively understand the mechanisms underlying intracellular therapeutic delivery with engineered Salmonella. Discovering the key mechanisms governing therapeutic delivery with Salmonella would address limitations with current delivery methods and provide a foundation to robustly improve delivery efficiency of the engineered bacteria for a wide variety of cancers.",

The first plasmid, P1, was created by cloning the flhDC gene into the PBAD his-myc plasmid (Invitrogen; catalog #V430-01). Primers vr46 and vr47 were used to PCR the flhDC gene from VNP20009 genomic DNA. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and DpnI (NEB, catalog #s R0193S, R0146S and R0176L). The PBAD-his-myc backbone was digested with NcoI, XhoI and calf intestinal phosphatase (NEB, catalog #M0290). A PCR cleanup column (Zymo Research) was used to clean up both products. 50 ng of digested vector backbone and 500 ng of digested PCR product were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The ligated product was transformed into DH5a E. Coli. Positive transformants were confirmed by sequencing (Plasmid P1a). To add the plac-GFP-myc genetic circuit to the plasmid, plasmid P1a was PCR amplified using primers vr385 and vr386. The plac-GFP-myc genetic circuit was PCR amplified from a previously generated plasmid (40) using primers vr394 and vr395. Both PCR products were DpnI digested. 50 ng of P1a PCR product and 500 ng of were ligated together using a 2\u00d7Hifi DNA assembly master mix (NEB). The resulting product was transformed into DH5a E. Coli and the complete P1b plasmid was purified from positive colonies.

Liver colonization was also reduced ten-fold between \u0394sifA and control Salmonella (*, P<0.05; FIG. 9B) indicating that the \u0394sifA strain exhibited overall poor fitness in vivo. Using a selective staining technique to detect bacterial lysis and protein delivery as previously described, engineered Salmonella visibly lysed more than \u0394sifA Salmonella inside cells at all time points (FIG. 9C). FID Sal lysed 18-fold more than \u0394sifA Salmonella (FIG. 9D; **, P<0.01). Cytosolic localization is important for protein therapies to have biological activity and anti-cancer activity. However, these results demonstrate that predominantly cytosolic Salmonella are not well suited for therapeutic delivery. This is a result of a combination of poor tumor colonization, poor systemic infectivity in vivo and poor lysis efficiency of \u0394sifA compared to FID Sal. The \u0394sifA strain of Salmonella fails to effectively colonize tumors and therefore, is not advantageous for intracellular protein delivery.",

                                "flhDC expression in Salmonella affects intracellular lysis and protein delivery after invasion. To understand this dynamic, cancer cells were infected with control lysing Salmonella (ID Sal) or lysing Salmonella reexpressing flhDC (FID-Sal) (FIG. 10A). As expected, FID Sal invaded cancer cells three times more than ID Salmonella (FIG. 10B, C; **, P<0.01). However, FID Sal lysed 33% less than control ID Sal (FIG. 10D; **, P<0.01). To understand why, the vacuolar/cytosolic distribution of control and flhDC expressing Salmonella was quantified after cancer cell infection (FIG. 10E). While most control Salmonella were contained in vacuoles (colocalized green and red), a larger percentage of flhDC reexpressing Salmonella were cytosolic (green only, FIG. 10F). On a population level, 90% of control were in vacuoles compared to 70% of flhDC reexpressing Salmonella (FIG. 10G). As a result, ID Salmonella were more likely to remain in vacuoles and lyse (white arrows, FIG. 10H) while a small fraction of FID Sal were more likely to escape the vacuole and remain intact (light blue arrows, FIG. 10I). In vivo, FID Sal qualitatively demonstrated a similar phenomenon (FIG. 10J). Unlysed and intracellular FID Sal were distributed throughout several cells (white arrows), likely, indicating that the bacteria were hyper-replicating in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. These results indicate that flhDC induction increases invasion but decreases lysis efficiency of engineered Salmonella, likely because of vacuolar escape.",

                                "Overexpressing flhDC in a vacuole escape impaired strain of engineered Salmonella rescued lysis efficiency and overall intracellular protein delivery. It was previously demonstrated that engineered \u0394sseJ Salmonella intracellularly lysed with high efficiency. It was therefore hypothesized that overexpressing flhDC in lysing \u0394sseJ Salmonella (\u0394sseJ FID Sal) would rescue lysis efficiency while maintaining high levels of invasion. Cells infected with \u0394sseJ FID Sal exhibited an increase in invaded, lysed bacteria (white arrow, FIG. 11A). The \u0394sseJ FID Sal invaded cancer cells 1.5-fold more than FID Sal and three-fold more than ID Sal (FIG. 11B, **, P<0.01). Intracellular \u0394sseJ FID Sal also lysed 25% more efficiently than FID Sal alone (FIG. 11C; **, P<0.01). The combination of these two phenomena (increased invasion and improved lysis) of the engineered strain increased overall protein delivery 2.5-fold over FID Sal (FIG. 11D; **, P<0.01). This data demonstrated that the reduced lysis efficiency resulting from flhDC activity could be rescued by overexpressing the transcription factor in Salmonella engineered to remain in vacuoles.",

                                "Modulating flhDC expression in engineered Salmonella had broad implications for intracellular therapeutic delivery within tumors (FIG. 12). Salmonella devoid of flhDC expression colonized tumors more selectively. However, overexpression of the transcription factor within systemic Salmonella decreased tumor colonization of the bacteria. Controlled expression of flhDC in tumors increased spatial distribution of extracellular and intracellular Salmonella. While flhDC expression reduced intracellular lysis efficiency of engineered Salmonella, overexpressing the transcription factor in a vacuolar resident, \u0394sseJ, strain rescued lysis efficiency and improved overall protein delivery in tumor cells. Together, results demonstrate the modulating flhDC expression in therapeutic Salmonella improves several driving features of protein delivery in tumors (FIG. 12).",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "It is shown herein that controlling flhDC expression of engineered bacteria maintains high colonization levels, improves tumor specificity and increases protein delivery distribution within tumors. Expression of flhDC also decreased intracellular lysis efficiency but was rescued by overexpressing the transcription factor in a vacuole localized strain (\u0394sseJ) of Salmonella. The combination of the two genetic engineering strategies increased overall intracellular protein delivery.",
                                "The colonization pattern of flhDC uninduced Salmonella suggests that only a few hundred single bacteria infiltrate tumors and grow in situ out of the two million that are injected. These ratios are corroborated by earlier work demonstrating that one out of ten thousand bacteria adhere to tumor vasculature (46). In histological samples flhDC uninduced Salmonella form spatially separated colonies overwhelmingly localized to tumor necrosis (FIG. 6B, C). Each of these colonies could originate from clonal expansion of a single bacteria that managed to colonize the tumor. If this is the case, it would suggest that bacterial influx into tumors occurs as a rare event, is strongly assisted by extensive necrosis, and is the rate limiting step of tumor colonization. Such a rare bacterial infiltration event could explain why tumor colonization is highly variable within populations of mice or humans as described previously (47). These results could explain why extensive tumor colonization was predominantly detected predominantly in the presence of tumor necrosis in humans (47). Combining tumor vascular disrupting agents with Salmonella could therefore reduce treatment variability between patients and enable effective colonization of small, necrosis deficient primary and metastatic tumors.",
                                "Two strategies could be used to robustly initiate bacterial colonization within tumors: (1) Co-administering bacteria along with a mild TNF-alpha inducer as previously described (48) or (2) genetically modifying Salmonella to evade systemic innate immune recognition (e.g., flhDC modulation). In scenario (1) as previously demonstrated, administration with lipid A (a known TNF-alpha inducing agent) did not cause septic shock but increased vascular permeability and therefore, could have increased the probability of bacterial infiltration into tumors across a large number of mice. In scenario (2), flhDC suppression of injected Salmonella could help the bacteria evade innate immune detection of flagella in systemically circulating bacteria. This could enable bacteria to persist longer systemically without causing septic shock. Longer systemic persistence could, in turn, increase the probability of bacterial infiltration into tumors.",
                                "Wild type Salmonella are likely not optimized to deliver therapies intracellularly within tumors. One reason for this might be that necrotic tumor tissue facilitates cecile and non-motile colonization of Salmonella. The data suggests that tumors select for non-motile and likely, non-flagellated bacteria since flagellated bacteria minimally colonize tumors (FIG. 5B) likely due to innate immune mediated clearance (8, 9). The flhDC uninduced bacteria were not impaired in colonization levels as compared to the control strain (FIG. 5D). Moreover, flhDC uninduced bacteria clustered in densely packed colonies largely located within tumor necrosis (FIG. 6B). This suggests that Salmonella have a higher affinity to colonize necrosis rather than viable tissue and that external control is required to enable Salmonella to invade viable tumors cells in an flhDC dependent manner. By controllably activating flhDC expression in intratumoral Salmonella, it was demonstrated that a significant fraction of these bacteria invaded and delivered protein into a spatially distributed set of cells.",
                                "Vacuolar residence could also aid in preventing premature clearance before tumor accumulation in addition to enabling lysis of engineered Salmonella. The current paradigm for intracellular, cytosolic therapeutic delivery is to enable Salmonella to escape the vacuole and directly invade the cytosol through deletion of the sifA gene (20). Similarly, bacterial variants expressing listeriolysin O have also been used to enable vacuolar escape of therapeutic Salmonella (49-51). However, it was determined that unnatural cytosolic escape of Salmonella (\u0394sifA) reduced tumor colonization 100-fold compared to the parental strain (FIG. 9A). This is likely because cytosolic pathogens elicit a strong antimicrobial and NF-kB dependent immune response that is detrimental to bacterial fitness in vivo (21, 52-55). The \u0394sifA bacteria also lysed 18-fold less than FID Salmonella. These results indicate that the engineered strain significantly improved the delivery potential Salmonella as compared to existing cytosolic delivery methods.",
                                "The engineered bacterial system described herein shares similarities with strains of Salmonella Typhi that have evolved to systemically infect human hosts. Humans serve as the natural host for Salmonella Typhi and upon ingestion, the bacteria stealthily translocate from the gut into systemic circulation without attracting a significant initial immune response (30). The bacteria can circulate systemically for extended periods of time without causing septic shock (30). The typhoidal strain accomplishes this by encoding a capsular regulatory protein, TviA. The transcription factor encodes for the Vi capsule that masks bacterial LPS (56). In addition, TviA suppresses flagellar and T3SS-1 activity in systemically circulating bacteria through repression of flhDC and HiLA expression, respectively 57. Masking of the LPS and downregulation of flagellar and T3SS-I activity leads to evasion of innate immune recognition (57). The instant delivery strain of Salmonella also has a modified LPS through deletion of msbB which prevents sepsis. In addition, the expression of flhDC, which activates flagellar and to a lesser extent, T3SS-1 synthesis (10), is suppressed upon systemic administration of the engineered Salmonella. The engineered strain of Salmonella and Salmonella Typhi also share the similarity that both types of bacteria reside mostly within the intracellular vacuole. Residence within the intracellular vacuole prevents bacterial detection by cytosolic, innate immune sensors like nod-like receptors, ubiquitin and NF-kB components. These genetic modifications likely act to mask common pathogen associated molecular patterns associated with Salmonella and increase systemic persistence without causing any adverse immune responses."

                                "The cell invasive capability of EBV-002 containing a single, chromosomal copy of PBAD-flhDC was assessed. Chromosomal integration of an inducible version of flhDC can create a master delivery vehicle that could be used to deliver any therapy into a tumor. Creating a single master delivery vehicle can streamline the manufacturing process of any EBV based therapy. To this end, a single copy of PBAD-flhDC was integrated in place of the endogenous flhDC gene within VNP20009 Salmonella. This chromosomally integrated strain was grown with arabinose to activate flhDC expression and used to infect cancer cells. The chromosomally integrated VNP20009 invaded cancer cells to similar levels as the bacteria containing episomal copies of flhDC (FIG. 13A). The chromosomal knockin of flhDC also was similarly inducible as compared to Salmonella with episomal PBAD-flhDC (FIG. 13B). This result indicated that the flhDC inducible genetic circuit could be genomically integrated in order to create a master EBV-002 delivery vehicle.",
                                "**Development of a Clinical Strain of EBV-002.**",
                                "A clinically compatible strain of EBV-002 was created by controlling activation of flhDC with salicylic acid, the active ingredient in aspirin (FIG. 14). Since flhDC is the main transcription factor controlling flagellar synthesis, chemotaxis and motility, bacteria are highly sensitive to even low expression levels of the protein. As a result, it was hypothesized that expression levels in the uninduced state would need to be tightly repressed in order to fully suppress uninduced cell invasion. To test this hypothesis, four different flhDC inducible EBV-002 strains were produced: salicylic induced 1) flhD, 2) flhD containing a weakly active ssrA degradation sequence, 3) flhD containing a moderately active ssrA degradation sequence and 4) flhD containing a highly active degradation tag (FIG. 14). The purpose of these degradation tags was to eliminate uninduced flhD activity that was a result of leaky expression from the pSal promoter. The intracellular invasion rates of each of these four strains were compared to the PBAD inducible version of flhDC. As expected, sample (1) was highly motile and invasive, with or without salicylic acid induction (FIG. 14B) indicating that the salicylic acid promoter was leaky. Samples (2), (3) and (4) only invaded cells after salicylic acid induction and were completely non-invasive otherwise. However, samples (2) and (3) were the most intracellularly invasive after aspirin induction (FIG. 14B). Most importantly, strains (2) and (3) were more invasive as compared to the PBAD inducible version of EBV-002 (FIG. 14B). These results demonstrate that the salicylic acid induction circuit was optimized to express flhD and regulate intracellular invasion of EBV-002 into cancer cells.",
                                "Sample (2) was characterized since this strain of EBV-002 had the highest range of activation between uninduced and induced samples. The induced bacteria swam a significantly longer distance as compared to uninduced EBV-002, which, remained stationary (FIG. 15A). Salicylate induced EBV-002 swam 12.7-fold farther than the uninduced control (***, P<0.001; FIG. 15B). This indicated that the salicylic acid inducible genetic circuit could robustly control flhDC activity in the clinical EBV-002 strain. As expected, the salicylic acid induced, clinical strain of EBV-002 invaded cancer cells 30 times more than the uninduced control (***, P<0.001; FIG. 15C, D). These results indicate that expressing flhD with a weakly active degradation tag using salicylic acid enabled the greatest control of intracellular invasion of EBV-002.",
                                "After determining which version of pSal-flhD was most effective at invading cancer cells with salicylic acid induction, the lowest amount of salicylic acid needed to enable intracellular invasion was determined next. EBV-002 was induced with either 10 nanomolar (nM), 100 nM, 500 nM, 1 micromolar (uM) or 10 uM salicylic acid and infected cancer cells with each of these strains. It was determined that a 500 nM concentration of salicylic acid was needed to enable intracellular invasion of EBV-002 (FIG. 16). This result is significant because it indicates that the induction threshold for EBV-002 is well within the concentration range of salicylic acid found in the blood stream (10-50 uM) after a person orally ingests aspirin. Together, these results indicate that EBV-002 is ready for use as an intracellular delivery vehicle within human tumors. Incorporation of the \u0394sseJ mutation into EBV-002 to create EBV-003.",
                                "The \u0394sseJ mutation was previously demonstrated to significantly increased lysis efficiency of the EBV strain. To this end, the EBV-002 strain containing the same salicylic acid inducible flhDC gene as well as the intracellular lysis cassette was additionally engineered with the \u0394sseJ mutation in order to create EBV-003.",
                                "**In Vivo Efficacy of EBV-003.**",
                                "Biodistribution and tumor selective protein delivery were assessed in mice bearing subcutaneous 4T1 tumors. Balb/C mice with \u02dc750 mm3 subcutaneous tumors were intravenously injected with 1\u00d7107 CFU of EBV-003. At 72 hours p.i., mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg of salicylic acid to induce flhDC expression within intratumoral bacteria. 24 hours later, mice were sacrificed and tumors, livers, and spleens were excised for analysis. Colonization and protein delivery of EBV-003 was compared to EBV-001 to assess any improvements. After colonization, EBV-003 colonized tumors 10.7-fold more than EBV-001 while keeping spleen and liver colonization unchanged (FIG. 17A, **, P<0.01). On average, EBV-003 delivered 31-fold more protein into tumor cells as compared to EBV-001 (FIG. 17B). Protein delivery was not, however, detected in the spleen or livers with either strain. These results demonstrate that EBV-003 is significantly more effective at colonizing and delivering protein selectively into tumors while sparing healthy tissue.",
                                "To determine whether EBV-003 intracellularly invaded cancer cells after salicylic acid induction in vivo, female balb/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 4T1 tumors. Once tumors were 500 mm3, the mice were injected with 1\u00d7106 CFUs via the tail vein. Seventy-two hours after bacterial administration, seven of the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg of sodium salicylate while four were given a saline injection as a control. Twenty-four hours after salicylic acid administration, the mice were sacrificed, tumors were excised, fixed and stained for Salmonella. Histological examination revealed that salicylic acid induction increased intracellular invasion of viable cancer cells within quiescent tumor tissue. More bacteria (Red Xs, FIG. 18A) were distributed across the quiescent tumor tissue after induction with salicylic acid (FIG. 18B). Salicylic acid induction resulted in a two-fold increase in cancer cells with intracellular EBV-003 as compared to the uninduced control (*, P<0.05; FIG. 18C). These results indicated that EBV-003 could be induced to invade cells using a therapeutic dose of salicylic acid.",
                                "Intracellular protein delivery with EBV-003 was also evaluated with and without salicylate induction. After salicylic acid induction, protein delivery was detected in five out of six tumors within the transition zones where tumor cells are rapidly dividing (white arrows, FIG. 19A). Whereas, delivery was only detected within the transition zone in one of the four uninduced, control mice (FIG. 19B). These results demonstrated that salicylate induction of EBV-003 enabled intracellular protein delivery in vivo.",
                                "In vivo colonization, invasion and protein delivery of EBV-003 in spontaneous breast cancer metastasis in the liver. The EBV-003 strain colonized, invaded and delivered protein selectively into metastatic breast cancer within the liver (FIG. 20). All dense bacterial colonies were only found within the metastatic breast cancer lesions within the liver (white outlined colonies, FIG. 20A). Moreover, 85% of these colonies were immediately adjacent, or within actively dividing tumor lesions (red arrows, FIG. 20A), where therapeutic delivery is most effective. On the other hand, colonies found in healthy tissue were observed far less frequently and were much smaller in size (FIG. 20A). Bacterial colonies were rarely spotted in healthy tissue and were very small (1, white arrow, FIG. 20B). However, in the metastatic lesions, the colonies appeared significantly larger in area (2, white arrows, FIG. 20B). Within the liver, 87.7% of colonies were found within the metastatic lesions while the other 12.3% were found within healthy liver tissue. Moreover, the size of the colonies within the metastatic lesions was over 118 times greater than the size of colonies in healthy tissue (***, p=2.2\u00d710-26; FIG. 20C). This equates to an 850-fold enrichment of EBV-003 in metastatic breast cancer lesions within the liver versus the immediately adjacent healthy tissue. While we have demonstrated the ability of therapeutic Salmonella to colonize primary tumors greater than 1,000-fold more than any other organ, this is the first demonstration that Salmonella preferentially colonize metastatic tumor lesions as compared to immediately adjacent healthy tissue to a similarly high magnitude. This illustrates the exquisite selectivity of EBV-003 to colonize tumor tissue regardless of whether the tumors are primary or metastatic lesions.",
                                "The EBV-003 strain also intracellularly invaded cancer cells within liver metastases (white arrows, FIG. 21A). However, there was no difference in invasion levels between salicylate induced and uninduced EBV-003 (FIG. 21B). One reason for this could be that most of the metastatic lesions contained a higher fraction of viable tumor tissue and lower amount of necrosis. As a result, EBV-003 bacteria were more likely to be in close proximity to viable tumor cells increasing the likelihood that the bacteria could intracellularly invade the cells regardless of induction status. This is in contrast to primary tumor tissue, where salicylate induction of flhDC increased the intracellular presence of EBV-003 within the quiescent tumor tissue (FIG. 18A). This could be because the bacteria preferentially colonized necrosis and required flhDC dependent motility to swim towards and intracellularly invade the actively dividing cancer cells. Therefore, this indicates that flhDC induction is necessary for intracellular invasion within a primary tumor mass but less so within small, non-necrotic metastatic or primary lesions.",
                                "Although EBV-003 seemed to invade metastatic cancer cells in the presence or absence of flhDC activity, protein delivery was detected at higher frequencies with salicylate induction in vivo. Cytosolic delivery into cells within metastatic tumors was detected histologically (white arrow, FIG. 22A). The frequency of protein delivery into cells within metastases was three-fold higher in induced EBV-003 versus uninduced EBV-003 (**, P<0.01; FIG. 22B). Taken together, these results indicate that induction of flhDC improves protein delivery in both primary and metastatic breast tumors.",
