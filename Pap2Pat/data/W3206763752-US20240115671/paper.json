    "date": "2021-10-21",
    "abstract": "Critical cancer pathways often cannot be targeted because of limited efficiency crossing cell membranes. Here we report the development of a Salmonella-based intracellular delivery system to address this challenge. We engineer genetic circuits that (1) activate the regulator flhDC to drive invasion and (2) induce lysis to release proteins into tumor cells. Released protein drugs diffuse from Salmonella containing vacuoles into the cellular cytoplasm where they interact with their therapeutic targets. Control of invasion with flhDC increases delivery over 500 times. The autonomous triggering of lysis after invasion makes the platform self-limiting and prevents drug release in healthy organs. Bacterial delivery of constitutively active caspase-3 blocks the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and lung metastases, and increases survival in mice. This success in targeted killing of cancer cells provides critical evidence that this approach will be applicable to a wide range of protein drugs for the treatment of solid tumors.",

                "Delivering protein drugs into the cytoplasm of cancer cells would expand the number of treatable cancer targets. More than 60% of the pathways that control cellular function are intracellular1 and almost all are difficult to access. Intracellular pathways control most of the hallmarks of cancer2 and have been the focus of a significant fraction of cancer research. Because of their specificity, protein biologics are excellent candidates for interfering with these pathways. However, bringing functional proteins across the cell membrane is technically challenging and current methods to deliver proteins intracellularly have poor efficacy3\u20135. Effective intracellular delivery, coupled with specific protein drugs, would provide treatments for previously incurable cancers.",
                "Once engineered, intracellular bacteria can efficiently deliver proteins to tumors. Current delivery methods, including nanoparticles, cell-penetrating peptides, and antibody drug conjugates have limited efficacy because of (1) poor uptake into cells, (2) lack of specificity to cancer cells, (3) degradation in the circulatory system, and (4) failure to escape from endosomes3,5\u201310. When particles and proteins are taken up by cells, they are trafficked from early and late endosomes to lysosomes, where they are degraded11\u201313. A bacterial system would not be limited by these mechanisms.",
                "Because of their physiology, Salmonella are uniquely suited to deliver proteins into cancer cells. Salmonella (1) actively invade cells14,15, (2) specifically accumulate in tumors16,17, (3) produce therapeutic molecules in situ18,19, and (4) reshape endosomes into hospitable environments14,20. In the intestines, Salmonella evade host defense mechanisms by entering epithelial cells using proteins encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1)21\u201323. This cellular invasion has not been measured in tumors. After invasion, the bacteria restructure endosomes into Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) by injecting proteins encoded by pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2)24\u201326. SCVs enable intracellular survival24,27 and protect from intracellular defense mechanisms28,29. A critical step in the activation of SPI2 genes is the sensing of the endosomal environment, a mechanism that is unique to Salmonella.",
                "A bacterial delivery system would have to incorporate three essential components: (1) synthesis of protein drugs, (2) invasion into cells, and (3) release of the drugs (Fig.\u00a01a). Protein synthesis can be controlled with bacterial translation machinery18,19. Control of invasion is necessary to carry the produced proteins into cells. Invasion requires both flagella and the type III secretion system-1 (T3SS-1)30,31. Flagella are essential for cell invasion30,31 because they sense the cell surface and determine the optimal location for invasion32. T3SS-1 is a needle apparatus that initiates invasion by injecting effector proteins into cells33\u201335. These proteins rearrange the actin cytoskeleton and induce endocytosis of the bacteria36,37. Production of these two bacterial structures is controlled by the factors fliZ and hilD, which are, in turn, controlled by the master regulator flhDC38\u201341. Protein release requires activation of Salmonella genes specifically inside cells. In Salmonella, this can be controlled with the promoters of SPI2 genes.",
                "The use of bacteria changes what is traditionally meant by \u201cdelivery.\u201d Unlike traditional delivery vehicles, bacteria manufacture protein drugs at the disease site42, delivering exponentially more molecules than were originally present in the injected bacteria. This specificity is the result of exponential growth in tumors, coupled with concurrent clearance from healthy organs16,17,43\u201346. Two potential protein drugs that exclusively affect intracellular proteins are the central domain of nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP1-CD) and constitutive two-chain active caspase-3 (CT Casp-3). NIPP1-CD induces cell death by competitively disrupting PP1 holoenzymes47. CT Casp-3 is an engineered form of caspase-3 that does not require intracellular activation. Caspase-3 is the dominant executioner caspase that causes apoptotic cell death48,49.",
                "Here, we describe the development of Intracellular Delivering (ID) Salmonella. We design this nonpathogenic, therapeutic strain to deliver proteins into solid tumors. It utilizes genetic circuits that control protein synthesis, invasion into cells, and release of protein drugs. This harnessing of the native invasion and survival machinery of Salmonella enables autonomous deposition of protein payloads directly into cancer cells. With this system, released proteins spread throughout the cytoplasm, are active, and interact with their cellular targets. In mouse models of breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ID Salmonella that produce CT Casp-3 are safe, decrease tumor growth and reduce established breast metastases. These outcomes show that this Salmonella-based delivery platform is an effective cancer therapy that renders the inside of cells more accessible to protein drugs."

                        "To determine the extent that Salmonella are intracellular in tumors, bacteria were administered to mice (Fig.\u00a01b, c). A specialized strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was used that expresses a fluorescent reporter when intracellular (Supplementary Table\u00a01). This strain was based on a therapeutic Salmonella strain (VNP20009; \u0394msbB, \u0394purI, \u0394xyl) with an additional deletion (\u0394asd) to enable plasmid retention in mice (Supplementary Table\u00a01). In tumor-bearing mice, most Salmonella were intracellular and activated the reporter (black arrows; Fig.\u00a01b, left), whereas some were exclusively extracellular (white arrows; Fig.\u00a01b, right). Over all tumors, 70% of Salmonella were intracellular (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, n\u2009=\u20095, Fig.\u00a01c).Fig. 1The intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella is controlled by flhDC.a The design goals were to genetically engineer a bacterial vehicle that (1) synthesizes a protein drug (yellow/purple), (2) actively invades into cancer cells, and (3) releases drug, which escapes Salmonella vacuoles (SCVs, red). b, c Ninety-six hours after intratumoral injection of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU of intracellular-reporting Salmonella into subcutaneous 4T1 tumors in BALB/c mice, more bacteria (red) were intracellular (green; black arrows) than extracellular (white arrows; P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u20091258 bacteria in 4 mice). d) In monolayer culture, Salmonella (light blue, arrows) invade cancer cells (red). Extracellular bacteria were removed with gentamicin (an invasion assay). e Knockout \u0394flhD Salmonella were transformed with PBAD-flhDC. Uninduced bacteria (flhDC-) minimally invaded cancer cells. Induction with 20\u2009mM arabinose (flhDC+) promoted invasion (black arrows). f Re-expression of flhDC significantly increased invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.0012; n\u2009=\u20093 independent biological samples). g In three-dimensional tumor-on-a-chip devices (top left), flhDC+ Salmonella, with a green invasion reporter (top right), invaded more cells than flhDC\u2212 controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u20096 chambers for flhDC+ and n\u2009=\u20094 for flhDC-).

                        "The dependence of invasion on the regulator flhDC was determined by deleting flhD from the genome of the parental strain (\u0394flhD Sal) and creating a strain with controllable re-expression (flhDC Sal; Supplementary Table\u00a01). The parental Salmonella strain expresses native levels of flhDC and naturally invades into cancer cells in culture (arrows, Fig.\u00a01d). Compared to uninduced control Salmonella (flhDC\u2212), only bacteria with re-expressed flhDC (flhDC+; arrows) invaded into cells (Fig.\u00a01e). Salmonella re-expressing flhDC invaded 84% of cells, which was 54 times greater than knockout controls (P\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a01f). In microfluidic tumor masses, which mimic tumor tissue bordering blood vessels, Salmonella with the intracellular GFP reporter and re-expressing flhDC invaded cells 53 times more than knockout controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a01g).

                        "Engineering Salmonella to release protein drugs required development of a system to trigger autonomous lysis after cell invasion (Fig.\u00a02). This goal was achieved by identifying a SPI2 promoter that is triggered intracellularly and is not active extracellularly. Coupled to a GFP reporter, the promoters of two SPI2-associated genes, Pssej and PsifA, both activated after invasion into cancer cells (white arrows; Fig.\u00a02a, left). Despite both being activated intracellularly, the extracellular expression (black arrows) of PsseJ was 5.8 times less than PsifA (P\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a02a top), indicating that it is more sensitive to cell invasion. The activity of PsseJ increased more than four times after invasion (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a02a bottom).Fig. 2Design of ID Salmonella to release protein into cells.a Salmonella with the PsifA-GFP or PsseJ-GFP reporter constructs both expressed GFP after invasion (white arrows). Extracellular expression (black arrows) from PsseJ-GFP was less than PsifA-GFP (P\u2009=\u20090.005; n\u2009=\u200927 for PsifA and n\u2009=\u20099 for PsseJ). The intracellular activity of the PsseJ promoter was four times greater than extracellular activity (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u200920). b Induction of PBAD-LysE at 96\u2009h (arrow) induced bacteria lysis (n\u2009=\u20093). c When administered to MCF7 cancer cells, Salmonella (red, white arrow) with PsseJ-LysE and Plac-GFP delivered GFP (green, black arrow) into the cellular cytoplasm. Only released, and not intrabacterial GFP was stained. d Most intracellular Salmonella with PsseJ-LysE lysed, which was significantly greater than PsseJ-GFP controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u20094). e Lysis of intracellular PsseJ-LysE Salmonella occurred for 10\u2009h after invasion (n\u2009=\u20093). The fraction of MCF7 cancer cells in which Salmonella lysed (disappeared) per hour (bars) was relatively constant. The cumulative fraction of cells with intact bacteria (open circles) decreased exponentially. f In liquid culture, PBAD-lysE and PsseJ-LysE Salmonella grew at similar rates as nontransformed controls (white bars). When intracellular, PsseJ-LysE Salmonella, lysed at a similar rate as induced PBAD-lysE Salmonella in culture (black bars; n\u2009=\u20093 for all conditions except n\u2009=\u20096 for uninduced PBAD-lysE). g The EGFP content of PsseJ-LysE Salmonella was determined by immunoblot. Lysed bacteria at 106, 107, 108, and 109 colony forming units (CFU) per well (four right lanes) were compared to EGFP standards at three concentrations: 1, 10, and 100\u2009ng/well (three left lanes). h Ninety-six hours after intratumoral injection of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 bacteria/mouse to BALB/c mice with subcutaneous 4T1 tumors (n\u2009=\u20093), ID Salmonella (which utilizes PsseJ-LysE) delivered GFP into cancer cells (arrows). i In the same mice, delivered GFP was present in extracts from tumors (T), but not livers (L) or spleens (S). Actin was used as a loading control. j Anti-actin nanobody (NB) and GFP (Ctr) was delivered into 4T1 cancer cells with ID Salmonella. Beta-actin was immuno-precipitated with delivered nanobody and was enriched 2.5 times compared to controls. Data are shown as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.

                        "To release a synthesized protein cargo, the bacteria must lyse after invasion. Triggered expression of Lysin gene E (LysE) from bacteriophage \u03a6X1174 caused rapid bacterial death (Fig.\u00a02b). After induction, Salmonella transformed with PBAD-LysE lysed at a rate of 0.39\u2009h\u22121 (Fig.\u00a02b). Salmonella, with the coupled PsseJ-LysE construct and that constitutively expresses GFP (white arrow), lysed after invasion into cancer cells and discharged GFP (black arrow) into the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a02c). Most (68%) PsseJ-LysE Salmonella lysed after invasion, which was significantly greater than PsseJ-GFP controls that did not lyse (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a02d). After invasion into cancer cells, the engineered bacteria lysed over the course of 10\u2009h (Fig.\u00a02e). During this period, the cumulative fraction of cancer cells with intact bacteria decreased exponentially at a rate of 0.33\u2009h\u22121, which is equivalent to a half-life of 2.1\u2009h (Fig.\u00a02e). The basal expression of Lysin E by the PsseJ-LysE circuit did not affect bacterial health and intracellular induction activated lysis at near to its maximum rate (Fig.\u00a02f). Based on immunoblot of lysed Salmonella, each bacterium contained, on average, 163,000 molecules of GFP, indicating how much protein can be delivered (Fig.\u00a02g).",
                        "We defined the platform strain that uses the PsseJ-LysE construct to deliver proteins as intracellular delivering (ID) Salmonella. In tumor-bearing mice, ID Salmonella invaded cells and delivered GFP that filled the entire cytoplasm of cells (black arrows, Fig.\u00a02h). The ID strain natively expresses flhDC and naturally invades into cells. Using selective permeabilization to isolate delivered protein and not include unreleased bacterial protein, it was determined that no GFP was delivered to the livers or spleens of any mice (Fig.\u00a02i). Comparison to a GFP standard showed that ID Salmonella delivered 60\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009\u00b5g GFP/g tumor, which is equivalent to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 bacteria per gram of tumor. To demonstrate specific targeting of an intracellular protein, cancer cells were administered ID Salmonella that delivered an anti-actin nanobody (Fig.\u00a02j). After invasion and lysis, the delivered nanobody (NB) was bound to cellular actin."

Treatment with a mild detergent selectively permeabilized the membranes of mammalian cells while leaving bacterial membranes intact. In cells administered ID Salmonella with PsseJ-LysE (Fig.\u00a03a, top), bacteria lysed (black arrows, faint red), and delivered GFP (bright green). Intact bacteria (white arrows, bright red, not green) could be easily distinguished from lysed bacteria. The faint red structures are membranes of lysed Salmonella. In cells administered nonlysing control Salmonella, only intracellular bacteria, and not the GFP in the bacteria, was visible (Fig.\u00a03a, bottom). The amount of GFP detected in cultures administered ID Salmonella was fifty times greater than control cultures (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a03b), showing the selectivity of the method.Fig. 3Release of delivered proteins from SCVs.a Selective permeabilization of cancer cell membranes enabled detection of released GFP. After administration to cells at an MOI of 10, ID Salmonella (top) released GFP (green, black arrows). Intact bacteria (red, white arrows) are easily discernable from the membranes of lysed bacteria (faint red, black arrows). In cells administered nonlysing Salmonella that produced GFP (bottom), only intracellular bacteria (red, white arrows) and no GFP was detected. b The amount of GFP detected in cultures administered ID Salmonella was fifty times greater than nonlysing controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u20099). c After invasion and before lysis, Salmonella (light blue, white arrow) are in LAMP1-stained SCVs (red, yellow arrows). d After lysis, GFP (green, black arrow) is retained within the membranes of SCVs (red, yellow arrow). e In phalloidin-stained cancer cells (red), released GFP (green, black arrows) moved from SCVs near the nucleus (blue) to throughout the cytoplasm. f From 6 to 24\u2009h after invasion, the percentage of released GFP in the cytosol increased from 25 to 75% (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u200921 at 6\u2009h and n\u2009=\u20096 at 24\u2009h). g The lysis of individual ID Salmonella released GFP that diffused through the cytosol of a cancer cell (see Supplementary Movie\u00a01). h Temporal profiles of GFP intensity, centered on the lysed bacteria. i Salmonella in LAMP1-stained SCVs (red, yellow arrow) lysed and released GFP (green, black arrow). Cytosolic bacteria (light blue, white arrow) did not lyse. j Most lysed bacteria, identified by colocalized staining for Salmonella and released GFP, were located within LAMP1-stained SCVs (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u20097). k Predominantly cytoplasmic \u0394sifA ID Salmonella remained intact (red, white arrows) and lysed less (green, black arrows) than predominantly vacuolar \u0394sseJ ID Salmonella and ID Salmonella (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n\u2009=\u20099).

                        "When ID Salmonella delivered protein to cells, it was first released into SCVs and then dispersed into the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013h). Immediately after invasion, most Salmonella (white arrow) resided within LAMP1-stained SCVs (yellow arrow, Fig.\u00a03c). After several hours, lysis of ID Salmonella released GFP into SCVs (yellow arrow), where it was retained by the vacuole membrane and was accessible to staining (black arrow, green dots, Fig.\u00a03d). At 6\u2009h after invasion, most GFP was contained in SCVs (Fig.\u00a03e, left), but by 24\u2009h, the GFP had escaped the SCVs and was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3e,\u00a0right). This migration of GFP from SCV to cytoplasm occurred in most cells (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a03f). From the lysis of a group of Salmonella (Fig.\u00a03g and Supplementary Movie\u00a01), the effective diffusivity of GFP through the cytoplasm was calculated to be 0.15\u2009\u00b5m2/min (Fig.\u00a03h).",
                        "As designed, lysis occurred because Salmonella reside within SCVs (Fig.\u00a03i\u2013k). This dependence on SCVs can be seen in the small population of Salmonella that escape into the cytoplasm and are not surrounded by a SCV membrane (white arrow, Fig.\u00a03i). ID Salmonella in LAMP1-stained SCVs (yellow arrow) released GFP (black arrow, Fig.\u00a03i). In comparison, ID Salmonella in the cytoplasm (light blue) did not release GFP (Fig.\u00a03i). Across multiple cells, more than 95% of lysed Salmonella were inside SCVs (P\u2009<\u20090.0001; Fig.\u00a03j). The dependence on SCVs was further quantified with ID Salmonella with \u2206sifA and \u2206sseJ deletions, which are predominantly cytoplasmic50 and vacuolar51, respectively (Fig.\u00a03k). After invasion into cancer cells, \u2206sifA ID Salmonella did not lyse (red, Fig.\u00a03k, upper left), whereas almost all \u2206sseJ ID Salmonella lysed (green, upper right). Without either deletion, some ID Salmonella did not lyse (red, Fig.\u00a03k, lower left), although most localized to SCVs, lysed and delivered protein (green). Both ID and \u2206sseJ ID Salmonella lysed significantly more than \u2206sifA ID Salmonella (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Fig.\u00a03k, lower right).

The induced death was dependent on cell invasion and protein delivery. Cells died (white arrow, red, lower right) 10\u2009h after Salmonella invasion and CT Casp-3 delivery (green, lower left). Cells that were not invaded and did not receive CT Casp-3 (yellow arrow) did not die. Similarly, cells that were invaded by control ID Salmonella and only delivered GFP (black arrow, upper left) did not die.

                        "Delivery of CT Casp-3 was effective against both liver cancer and triple-negative breast cancer in mice (Fig.\u00a07e\u2013j). After 14 days of treatment, delivery to BALB/c mice reduced the volume of 4T1 mammary tumors two times more than controls (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a07e). Bacterial delivery of CT Casp-3 was also nontoxic. When injected into tumor-free mice, CT Casp-3 Salmonella was cleared from most organs in 7 days (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02) and did not induce any toxicity compared to either saline or empty ID Salmonella (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). In BALB/c mice, treatment with CT Casp-3 blocked the growth of established 4T1 metastases in the lung (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a07f, g).

This reduction in growth is equivalent to an increase in doubling time from 5 to 148 days. Tumor volume reduced in two mice for over 50 days, and survival increased significantly compared to bacterial controls (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a07j). In mice that survived over 50 days, no toxic effects were observed from long-term bacterial therapy. Treatment with CT Casp-3 completely eliminated the tumor from one mouse, which remained disease free for over 300 days."

                "We have created an autonomous, intracellular Salmonella vehicle that efficiently delivers active proteins into cells. The ID Salmonella strain is safe, reduces the growth of tumors and metastases, and increases survival in mice. The developed bacterial strains utilize three gene circuits that enable precise control of drug production, cell invasion, and protein release. These processes were derived from natural capabilities of Salmonella. The PsseJ-LysE circuit was designed to trigger protein release independent of external intervention (Fig.\u00a02). This self-timing system triggers delivery at the most opportune time for each bacterium and ensures that proteins are deposited inside cells and not in the extracellular environment. As a platform, ID Salmonella are capable of delivering multiple types of proteins including nanobodies and cytotoxic proteins (NIPP1-CD and CT Casp-3).",
                "The PsseJ-LysE circuit makes ID Salmonella self-limiting and safer than nonlysing Salmonella. After injection, the density of ID Salmonella in tumors reaches a maximum at 72\u2009h (Fig.\u00a05b). After this peak, the bacteria are cleared. In comparison, our group and others have shown that nonlysing Salmonella grow exponentially in tumors16,53. This peak in bacterial density is most likely caused by the timing of invasion and lysis. During the first 72\u2009h after injection, ID Salmonella accumulate in tumor tissue, invade into cancer cells, and form SCVs. After 72\u2009h, the Salmonella in the SCVs lyse, which releases their contents into host cells and reduces the bacterial density. This intracellular lysis would limit unintended exposure to protein therapies and reduce the possibility of unwanted infections.",
                "Salmonella were used to create this delivery platform because of their unique physiology. Two essential qualities of a delivery species are invasiveness and ability to sense the intracellular environment. Numerous bacterial species invade into cells54,55, but the promoters of SPI1 and SPI2 are unique to Salmonella. The SPI2 promoters provide a tool to activate gene expression once the bacteria are in SCVs, which are explicitly intracellular. At first it would appear that residence in SCVs would be detrimental to protein delivery. Indeed, when ID Salmonella first lyse, the payload protein is released into SCVs (Fig.\u00a03d). However, with time, the protein disperses into the cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a03e\u2013h), where it can interact with its targets (Fig.\u00a04g). This dispersion is most likely mediated by the breakdown of the vacuole membrane once the bacteria are no longer viable and injecting effector proteins to maintain membrane integrity56,57. In this way, accumulation in SCVs provides a tool to precisely control the timing of protein release.",
                "Control of cell invasion is another tool that could increase the safety and efficacy of protein delivery. We discovered that the regulator protein complex FlhDC is necessary for cell invasion (Fig.\u00a01f\u2013i) and we developed a gene circuit (PBAD-flhDC) to controls its expression (Fig.\u00a04). In culture and tumors, activation of flhDC increased protein delivery (Fig.\u00a04c, h, i) by forcing all bacteria to produce flagella, invade cells and lyse. Modulating flhDC also has the potential to control the location of delivery. For example, expression could be induced after bacteria have accumulated in tumors and cleared from most organs. Activating flhDC would trigger bacteria to invade nearby cancer cells and deliver their protein payload. This timing would focus delivery to tumors and prevent release of therapeutic molecules into healthy tissue.",
                "Two essential qualities of ID Salmonella enable the use of protein drugs that are currently not feasible. Constitutively active proteins would be too toxic if delivered traditionally and limited access to intracellular compartments would reduce efficacy. Active transport across the cell membrane and specific accumulation in tumors solves both of these problems. The example proteins, NIPP1-CD and CT Casp-3, have exclusively intracellular targets and would be ineffectual without intracellular delivery. Both of these proteins were modified from their natural counterparts to be constitutively active and would be toxic if delivered into all cells systemically. Importantly, CT Casp-3 activates apoptotic pathways that are circumvented by most cancer cells48. Molecules that have ubiquitous targets would be effective in most cancer types and would be independent of a cancer\u2019s mutational profile. Specific accumulation in tumors ensures the safety of the therapy and prevents adverse events (Figs.\u00a05 and S4).",
                "The differential response of tumors to delivery of CT Casp-3 and NIPP1-CD suggests that efficacy is dependent on many factors, and not just cellular cytotoxicity. In culture, delivery of both molecules killed cancer cells (Figs.\u00a06a\u2013c and 7a\u2013d); however, NIPP1-CD was not effective in mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). This suggests that the response to a bacterial delivered protein is dependent on the cellular environment, other tumor-associate cells, and the immune response. These dependences may also be uniquely affected by the presence of tumor-colonized bacteria.",
                "The use of ID Salmonella to deliver CT Casp-3 could address the need for an effective treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). No curative treatment currently exists for the 840,000 patients who are diagnosed with HCC annually58,59. Current therapies have toxic side effects and only modestly increase survival59\u201361. Treatment with CT Casp-3 Salmonella could be safer (Figs.\u00a05, S3, and S4) and more effective (Fig.\u00a07). By seven days after injection, CT Casp-3 Salmonella were cleared from most organs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). The presence of bacteria in organs shortly after injection (6\u2009h, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a) has been commonly observed, and these organisms are predominantly in the blood and not interacting with tissues17. Although trace amounts of bacteria were present in the spleen at 7 days, autonomous lysis caused this amount to be about 1000 times lower than previous measurements17,53. In addition, no delivered proteins were detected in healthy tissue (Fig.\u00a04f) and no toxicities were observed from the bacteria or the CT Casp-3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04).",
                "Delivery with ID Salmonella will enable targeting of inaccessible cancer pathways and will accelerate the generation of cancer therapies. These therapies can be created by coding the genes for specific protein drugs into Salmonella expression cassettes. Nanobodies (Fig.\u00a04g) can be designed that specifically inhibit pathways necessary for cancer survival and progression. The efficacy in a metastatic breast cancer model (Fig.\u00a07f, g) suggests that ID Salmonella finds and halts metastases and could be used to treat advanced disease. Using bacteria to deliver proteins into cells will expand the number of accessible pathways, open up many targets across the soluble proteome for treatment, and increase the efficacy and safety of cancer treatment."
