                        "IL13R\u03b12 (Lupardus, Birnbaum et al. 2010), which is a versatile therapeutic target due to its rare expression in normal tissue (Debinski and Gibo 2000) and overexpression in many human cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Thaci, Brown et al. 2014), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Shimamura, Fujisawa et al. 2010), melanoma (Beard, Abate-Daga et al. 2013), ovarian carcinoma (Kioi, Kawakami et al. 2006), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Shibasaki, Yamasaki et al. 2015), breast cancer (Papageorgis, Ozturk et al. 2015), and lung cancer (Xie, Wu et al. 2015). A second IL13 receptor family member, IL13R\u03b11, interacts with IL13 with lower affinity (Lupardus, Birnbaum et al. 2010), and is ubiquitously expressed in healthy tissue (Debinski and Gibo 2000). Additionally, IL13R\u03b11 and IL4R\u03b1, a receptor pair that binds IL13 with high affinity (Lupardus, Birnbaum et al. 2010) to mediate signaling through the JAK/STAT6 pathway (Murata, Taguchi et al. 1998), are co-expressed in pulmonary tissue (Hecker, Zaslona et al. 2010). Despite this wide expression of IL13 binding partners in healthy tissue, an IL13-ligand based CAR has shown safety in humans during clinical trials with locoregional central nervous system (CNS) delivery in GBM (Brown, Badie et al. 2015, Brown, Alizadeh et al. 2016), suggesting that toxicity from on-target/off-disease binding is not problematic in this context. However, for the treatment of systemic disease, the wide expression of IL13 binding partners outside of the diseased tissue could act as a sink for IL13-based therapy, resulting in safety concerns and possibly impeding trafficking to the disease site. Previous work in the field has attempted to address this problem by generating CARs derived from IL13 mutants containing mutations to direct binding away from IL13R\u03b11/IL4R\u03b1. Mutations at E13 have yielded improved selectivity for IL13R\u03b12 over IL13R\u03b11 (Kahlon, Brown et al. 2004, Krebs, Chow et al. 2014), albeit with the E13Y mutation still allowing measurable recognition of IL13R\u03b11 in the context of both recombinant antigen and antigen-expressing cancer cells (Krebs, Chow et al. 2014). The addition of both E13K and R109K mutations into an IL13-based CAR also showed attenuated, but not abolished, recognition of IL13R\u03b11-expressing cancer cells relative to IL13R\u03b12-expressing cancer cells (Kong, Sengupta et al. 2012). While these examples are encouraging, additional mutations will be required to develop an IL13R\u03b12-specific IL13 mutant. Among the challenges in developing such molecules is that the impact of IL13 mutations on the function of an IL13 containing CAR cannot be predicted."

Both C4 and D7 showed IL13R\u03b12 binding comparably to WT, but no detectable binding to IL13R\u03b11 at the concentration tested. Surface plasmon resonance studies further confirmed these observations (FIG. 1C and FIG. 2A-F). WT, C4, and D7 all exhibit subnanomolar affinity for IL13R\u03b12 (0.001 nM, 0.393 nM, and 0.003 nM, respectively). However, the three variants strongly differ in binding affinity to IL13R\u03b11, confirming previous reporting (Moraga, Richter et al. 2015). These differences result in a several-log range of selectivity for IL13R\u03b12 relative to IL13R\u03b11, with WT, C4, and D7 exhibiting 440-fold, 92,000-fold, and 1,400,000-fold stronger affinity for IL13R\u03b12 relative to IL13R\u03b11. To further confirm this selectivity, IL 13 WT, IL13 C4, and IL13 D7 were tested in a variety of biological assays wherein activation through IL13R\u03b11 would yield functional outputs. First, soluble IL13 variants were titrated against IL13-responsive A549 cells for 15 minutes, and the phosphorylation of STAT6 was assessed by flow cytometry (FIG. 3A). Relative to WT, D7 and C4 both showed attenuated STAT6 phosphorylation, with the latter being more pronounced. Second, human fibroblasts were stimulated with IL13 variants for 8 hours, and upregulation of the CCL26 gene was assessed by qPCR (FIG. 3B). At both concentrations tested, WT induced strong upregulation of CCL26. D7 yielded an attenuated response, only inducing upregulation at the higher concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. C4 yielded essentially no response at both concentrations tested. Finally, IL13 variants were titrated against TF-1 for 96 hours, and cell proliferation was tracked (FIG. 3C). Relative to WT, treatment with D7 and C4 yielded attenuated proliferation, with the latter again being more pronounced.",
                                "**Example 2: Variant IL13 CAR**",
                                "CAR that include C4 IL13, D7 IL13, E12Y IL13 or WT IL13 were generated. The four CAR were otherwise identical and included the CD28 co-stimulatory. The CAR included: a IgG4-Fc linker mutated at two sites within the CH2 region (L235E; N297Q) to reduce Fc receptor binding, a CD28 transmembrane domain, and the intracellular signaling domain of CD28 in series with CD3\u03b6 (FIG. 4A). Our group and others have observed that IL13-based CARs with CD28-based costimulation (vs 4-1BB costimulation) have more sensitive recognition of IL13R\u03b11 expression (Brombacher, Nono et al. 2017). Therefore, in order to better differentiate IL13R\u03b12 specificity, we used CD28 costimulation as part of the CAR backbone. In addition, CAR cassettes have a T2A ribosome skip sequence followed by a truncated CD19 used as a marker of lentiviral transduction efficiency, cell tracking, and enrichment. Flow cytometry analysis of CD19t for cell transduction and IgG4-Fc for CAR detection confirm comparable expression for the four IL13-CAR variants (FIG. 4B). For all in vitro and in vivo studies, IL13-CARs were engineered in na\u00efve/memory T cells (Tn/mem). Tn/mem are enriched CD62L+na\u00efve and memory T cells, including both the central memory (Tcm) and stem cell memory (Tscm) populations, along with na\u00efve T cells (Tn).",
                                "To assess target specificity of the IL13-CART cells, we evaluated their binding affinities to recombinant human IL13R\u03b12 and IL-13R\u03b11 in dose-response curves (FIG. 4C). T cells stably expressing the indicated IL13-based constructs were titrated with biotinylated IL13R\u03b11 or IL13R\u03b12 for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. The level of receptor bound to IL13 was measured by incubating the cells with streptavidin coupled to Alexa Fluor-647. E12Y and D7 CAR T cells bind to IL13R\u03b12 with similar affinity to WT, i.e., 1.8 nM (95% CI: 1.0-3.7 nM), 4.2 nM (95% CI: 2.8-6.3 nM) and 1.7 nM (95% CI: 1.2-2.4 nM) respectively, whereas C4 displayed a weaker affinity, 29 nM (95% CI: 23-36) (FIG. 4C, right panel). Notably, the affinities of IL13-derived CARs for IL13R\u03b12 are two to three orders of magnitude weaker than those of the free proteins. By contrast, D7 and C4 CAR T cells exhibited minimal binding to IL13R\u03b11 on the assayed concentration range, whereas WT and E12Y had nearly identical affinity (34 nM; 95% CI: 21-54 nM for both variants) (FIG. 4C, left panel).",

                                "We assessed IL13R\u03b12-targeting abilities of the IL13 wild type and variant CAR T cells by examining antigen-specific T cell activation. For these functional studies we used three IL13R\u03b12-expressing human cancer cell lines. The patient-derived primary glioblastoma tumor line PBT030-2 and human glioma line U251T endogenously express IL13R\u03b12 at high levels, consistent with its overexpression in pathological conditions (FIG. 5A-5C). The IL13 receptor family negative human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 was engineered to overexpress IL13R\u03b12 (HT1080-IL13R\u03b12). IL13R\u03b12 expression on the cell lines was confirmed by flow cytometry, western blot and qPCR (FIG. 5A-5C). Using CD107a as a marker of degranulation, we evaluated CAR T cell effector function after co-culturing the cells with the three IL13R\u03b12-expressing cell lines at a 1:1 effector to target (E:T) ratio for five hours. WT, E12Y, D7, and C4 CAR T cells had comparable CD107a expression against all the IL13R\u03b12-expressing cell lines, measured as percent positive cells, with negligible CD107a expression seen in mock (untransduced) T cells (FIG. 6A). As another measure of T cell activity, we evaluated cytokine production, both intracellular IFN-\u03b3 production by flow cytometry (FIG. 6B) and secreted IFN-\u03b3 in response to increasing concentrations of immobilized recombinant human IL13R\u03b12-Fc (FIG. 6C). The percentage of cells positive for intracellular IFN-\u03b3 after a 5-hour incubation at E:T 1:1 with the IL13R\u03b12-expressing cell lines was similar across WT, E12Y, D7, and C4 CAR T cells, with mock T cells producing negligible IFN-\u03b3. The levels of secreted IFN-\u03b3 as a function of IL13R\u03b12 concentration varied across the CAR T cell types, with WT and E12Y CAR T cells secreting the highest IFN-\u03b3 concentration, followed by D7, and then C4 CAR T cells.",
                                "To further investigate functional differences between IL13 wild type and variant CAR T cells, we performed in vitro tumor killing assays. CAR T cells were co-cultured with tumor targets PBT030-2, U251T, and HT1080-IL13R\u03b12 at E:T 1:10 for two days, and viable remaining tumor cells were counted by flow cytometry with results expressed as percentage normalized to the tumor cell count after incubation with mock T cells. All of the CART cells (WT, E12Y, D7, and C4) killed the tumor cells with similar efficiency (FIG. 6D). The functional characteristics of the CAR T cells were consistent across four distinct healthy donors within each experiment. In an extended long-term killing assay, CAR T cells co-cultured at E:T 1:50 with PBT030-2 had similar cytolytic activity regardless of IL13 variant and across four donors (FIG. 6E). Importantly, cytotoxicity observed using IL13 mutein CARs was significantly higher than mock and no T cell controls (p<0.005 in all cases). From the same experiments, analysis of live CAR T cells after seven days of co-culture showed persistence/proliferation in the wild type and variant CAR T cells, compared with the no T cell and mock controls, in which no live T cells were observed (FIG. 6F). Of note, C4 displayed lower levels of CART cell persistence/expansion as compared to the other IL13 CARs, suggesting reduced potential for antigen-dependent proliferation.",

                                "We evaluated the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of the CAR T cells in our previously established xenograft brain tumor model with IL13R\u03b12 PBT030-2 cells engineered to express the firefly luciferase (ffluc) reporter gene (Brown, Starr et al. 2012). In three independent experiments, tumor-bearing NSG mice (1\u00d7106 tumor cells injected intracranially; 9\u00b11 days engraftment) that received intratumoral (i.t.) injection of 0.3\u00d7106 mock (untransduced) T cells exhibited tumor growth and survival similar to non-treated controls, whereas treatment with WT, E12Y, C4, and D7 CAR T cells efficiently reduced tumor burden (FIG. 7A). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrates improved survival for mice treated with IL13 wild type and variant CART cells (FIG. 7B and FIG. 8), and by day 150 the mice treated IL13 wild type and variant CAR T cells had similar numbers of tumor-free and tumor relapsed mice (FIG. 7C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that C4 and D7 CAR T cells exhibit similar in vivo anti-tumor activity for IL-13R\u03b12 expressing tumors compared with WT and E12Y CAR T cell treatment.",

                                "Several human cancer cell lines with varying expression of IL13R\u03b11 were used to evaluate relative effector activity of IL13 wild type and variant CART cells. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 endogenously expresses moderate levels of IL13R\u03b11 with no detectable IL13R\u03b12 or IL4R\u03b1. Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, which does not express IL13R\u03b11, IL13R\u03b12, or IL4R\u03b1, was engineered to overexpress either IL13R\u03b11 (denoted HT1080-IL13R\u03b11) or both IL13R\u03b11 and IL4R\u03b1 (denoted HT1080-IL13R\u03b11-IL4R\u03b1) (FIG. 5A-5C). In 5 hour co-culture of CART cells with IL13R\u03b11-expressing tumor cells (A549 and HT1080-IL13R\u03b11) at 1:1 E:T, WT and E12Y induced significantly more surface expression of CD107a (FIG. 9A) and intracellular expression of IFN-\u03b3 (FIG. 9B) than C4 and D7 (p<0.05 for all comparisons). In contrast, when CART cells were co-cultured with HT1080-IL13R\u03b11-IL4R\u03b1, E12Y and D7 showed similar expression of surface CD107a and intracellular IFN-\u03b3, whereas C4 displayed attenuated response relative to E12Y in both assays (p<0.05 for both). Notably, against HT1080-IL13R\u03b11-IL4R\u03b1 cells, all the mutein CAR T cells (E12Y, C4, and D7) had a significantly lower frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells compared with WT CART cells. Evaluation of secreted IFN-\u03b3 after culture with plate-bound IL13R\u03b11 revealed distinct differences in T cell activity among the CAR variants. WT and E12Y both secreted significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 levels compared with C4 and D7, which had nearly undetectable IFN-\u03b3 (FIG. 9C). The results of long-term killing assays against IL13R\u03b11-expressing cancer cell lines mirrored those of the degranulation and cytokine production assays: C4 and D7 CAR T cells showed diminished killing relative to WT and E12Y (FIG. 9D). Against HT1080-IL13R\u03b11-IL4R\u03b1, D7 killed comparably to E12Y and WT whereas C4 showed significantly less tumor killing (p<0.05 for all comparisons).",
                                "To interrogate the selectivity of the C4 and D7 mutein CAR T cells in vivo, we investigated the anti-tumor activity of the CAR T cells in xenograft models using IL13R\u03b11-expressing tumor cells. In order to detect small differences in CAR T cell activity with greater sensitivity, we used the Winn assay to directly evaluate effector activity by incubating tumor and T cells together for two hours prior to injection (Winn 1960, Winn 1961). We co-cultured 1\u00d7106 WT, E12Y, C4 and D7 CAR T cells with 0.1\u00d7106 A549 cells for 2 hours followed by engraftment of the co-cultured cells into NSG mice (FIG. 9E). Following tumor growth kinetics over 60 days, the WT CART cells ablated engraftment of IL13R\u03b11-expressing tumors. All CAR T cell variants displayed some delay in engraftment relative to PBS and mock T cell treated tumors. At later time points, C4 CAR T cells displayed significantly less growth inhibition than WT and E12Y (p<0.05 for all comparisons on days 54 and 58).",

The mice were treated with mock, WT, E12Y, C4, and D7 CAR T cells, or PBS by intratumoral injection (FIG. 9F). Again, the C4 CAR T cells had the least amount of antitumor activity, with tumor growth comparable to PBS treated and mock T cell treated mice (FIG. 9F). Similar to the in vitro killing assays, D7 and E12Y CAR T cell treatment showed comparable decreased antitumor activity relative to WT CAR T cells (p<0.05 for all comparisons Day 16 and thereafter).",

For extended killing assays, effectors and targets were co-cultured at 1:50 ratio for 7 days in the absence of cytokines, with fresh media replenishment every 3-4 days. At the end of assay, adherent tumors were harvest enzymatically using trypsin (Corning, Corning, NY). Cells were then stained with human CD45, CD8, CD19 and IL13R\u03b12 and assessed by flow. Tumor killing by CART cells was calculated by comparing viable CD45-negative cell counts relative to that observed with mock (non-transduced) T cells.",

In orthotopic model, ffLuc+PBT030-2 cells (1\u00d7105) were stereotactically implanted into the right forebrain of NSG mice on day 0. Mice were then treated intratumorally with 0.2-2.0\u00d7106 CAR T cells as indicated for each experiment. Groups of mice were then monitored for tumor engraftment by Xenogen non-invasive optical imaging as previously described (Kahlon, Brown et al. 2004), or for survival, with euthanasia applied according to the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines. Subcutaneous model was established by injecting HT1080 tumors (5\u00d7105, 50 \u03bcl) in 50% v/v Matrigel\u00ae (coming, coming, NY) to the flank of NSG mice. Four days after tumor engraftment, CAR T cells (5\u00d7106) were injected intratumorally and tumors sizes were monitored by caliper. To perform Winn assay, A549 tumors (1\u00d7105) and CART cells (1\u00d7106) were co-incubated in culture media at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Cell mixtures were then mix with 50% v/v Matrigel\u00ae and injected to the flank of NSG mice.",
