                        "The power and capacity of computing components such as microprocessors and memory circuits has been increasing for the last 50 years, as the size of the functional units, such as transistors, has been decreasing. This trend is now reaching a limit, however, as it is difficult to make the current functional units (such as MOSFETs) any smaller without affecting their operation.",
                        "The technology employed to manufacture conventional silicon integrated circuits is today well established. Current microprocessors feature several hundreds of millions of transistors which are manufactured in high throughput lines.",
                        "Developments are ongoing to implement new types of advanced processing apparatuses that can implement powerful computations exploiting the rules of quantum mechanics. Such advanced processing apparatuses promise computational capacities well beyond current devices for a specific range of algorithms. Approaches to the realisation of devices for implementing quantum bits (qubits), the basic computational unit of a quantum processor, have been explored with different levels of success. A workable quantum processor needs to be able to perform two-qubit operations with low-error thresholds and be scalable. For example, semiconductor based qubits have been developed and described in a number of earlier patent publications, including U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,681 (Kane), U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,404 (Kane). The operation of these qubits is based on the exploitation of the quantum effects of a single dopant atom in a silicon crystalline lattice and the interaction between qubits is mediated by electron exchange coupling.",
                        "One of the problems related to this model is that the exchange interaction between electrons decays exponentially with donor separation and is highly dependent on the precise placement of the donors within a single lattice site, due to the oscillatory profile of the electron wave-function. The successful implementation of this architecture requires positioning of donors, separated by only 15 nm, with sub-nm precision. Such a level of precision makes the fabrication of the architecture very challenging, as discussed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7,547,648 (Ruess et al.).",
                        "It has also been proposed to encode quantum information using the spin states of semiconductor quantum dots (Loss and DiVincenzo (Loss, DiVincenzo, DP quantum computation with quantum dots. Phys Rev. A56, 120; 1998).). This proposal primarily envisaged the use of quantum dots formed using electrostatic gates on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. However, the limited coherence time and the associated fidelity of the quantum state in these systems represent a significant hurdle to application of quantum dots in a quantum processor. Experimental work has been done in GaAs/AlGaAs on quantum dot qubits, but to realise large-scale arrays of such structures will require new manufacturing process technologies to be developed. More importantly, these materials suffer from problems with fidelity and dephasing time due to the presence of nuclear spins that are inherent to the GaAs crystal lattice.",
                        "Superconducting qubits have recently achieved low-error performance and a promising scalability. These qubits however have a macroscopic size (hundreds of micrometres scale) which prevents architectures from being fabricated with a large number of qubits within a small chip size. The large size, combined with the operation a GHz frequencies, can pose challenges in controlling the electromagnetic modes of a large number of qubits hosted in a cavity wider than the wavelength of the electromagnetic fields."

This substantially relaxes the precision requirements for fabrication. Advantageously, the schemes are compatible with the accuracy in donor placement achieved with ion implantation, as well as with scanning tunnelling microscope lithography.",
                        "In accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides a method of operation of a quantum processing element, the processing element comprising:\n\n\n- - a semiconductor and a dielectric material forming an interface with\n    the semiconductor;\n  - a donor atom embedded in the semiconductor at a distance from the\n    interface; and\n  - a conductive electrode disposed on the dielectric material; the\n    method comprising the steps of:\n  - applying a magnetic field to the quantum processing element to\n    separate the energy of the spin states associated with an electron\n    and a nucleus of the donor atom; and\n  - applying an electric field in the region between the interface and\n    the donor atom to modulate a hyperfine interaction between the\n    electron and the nucleus and control the quantum state of a quantum\n    bit associated with a pair of electron-nuclear spin eigenstates of\n    the electron and the nucleus.",
                        "The pair of electron-nuclear spin eigenstates comprises the \u2018electron spin up-nuclear spin down\u2019 and \u2018electron spin down-nuclear spin up\u2019 eigenstates. This type of qubit can be referred to as flip-flop qubit.",
                        "The electric field in the region between the interface and the donor atom may be applied by applying an oscillating electric signal to the electrode. The electrode may be an independent electrode or part of a structure suitable for addressing multiple processing elements.",
                        "In an embodiment, the frequency of the oscillating electric signal is selected based on the amplitude of the applied continuous magnetic field. This frequency may be also selected to be equal to an excitation frequency of the quantum bit and detuned from the orbital excitation frequency of the electron to prevent orbital excitation of the electron. The energy difference between the orbital states of the electron, and therefore the electron orbital excitation frequency, depends sensitively on the depth of the electron from the interface between the semiconductor and the dielectric material, because the electron can be displaced from the donor to the interface by the electric field applied in its vicinity.",
                        "In an embodiment, the oscillating electric signal and the magnetic field may be applied simultaneously to induce a transition in the quantum state of the quantum bit.",
                        "In an embodiment, the method further comprises the step of applying an oscillating magnetic field to the processing element to transfer the quantum state associated with the pair of electron-nuclear spin eigenstates to a quantum state associated with the nuclear spin to implement a nuclear spin quantum bit.",
                        "In accordance with a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of operation of a quantum processing element, the processing element comprising:\n\n\n- - a semiconductor and a dielectric material forming an interface with\n    the semiconductor;\n  - a donor atom embedded in the semiconductor at a distance from the\n    interface; and\n  - a conductive electrode disposed on the dielectric material; the\n    method comprising the steps of:\n  - applying a continuous magnetic field to the quantum processing\n    element to separate spin states associated with an electron and a\n    nucleus of the donor atom;\n  - applying an oscillating magnetic field which oscillates at a\n    frequency close to a Zeeman frequency of the electron; and\n  - applying an electric field in the region between the interface and\n    the donor atom to modulate a hyperfine interaction between the\n    electron and the nucleus and control the quantum state of a quantum\n    bit associated with the spin of the nucleus;\n  - wherein the frequency of the oscillating magnetic field is selected\n    based on the frequency of the oscillating electric signal.",
                        "This type of qubit can be referred to as nuclear-spin qubit. One advantage of using the nuclear-spin as a qubit is that it has a long coherence time since it is less prone to electromagnetic interaction with the external environment.",

                        "In some embodiments, the method further comprises the step of applying an electric bias to the conductive electrode to displace the electron and create an electric dipole associated with the processing element. The dipole created can interact with another electric dipole of another processing element via dipole-dipole interaction to allow interaction of the quantum states of two processing elements and coupling of two qubits. In order to allow controllable coupling, the electrical bias may be maintained for a predetermined period of time, and then switched off.",

An arrangement for confining electromagnetic modes may be disposed in proximity of the processing element. The electromagnetic field modes may be quantized to comprise zero, one, or more photons. The interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field modes and the electron may be used to enable coupling of the zero, one or more photons to the quantum state of the quantum bit.",

The state of the quantum bit may be read-out by measuring the shift in the resonance frequency of the resonator caused by the coupling of the photon(s) to the qubit.",

A donor atom 18 is located within the substrate 12 inside region 19 under gate 16. The donor can be introduced into the substrate using nano-fabrication techniques, such the hydrogen lithography provided by scanning-tunneling-microscopes, or the industry-standard ion implantation techniques. Processing element 10 includes a single atom 18 embedded in the silicon crystal. However, the methods described herein may be applied to processing elements including clusters of more than one embedded atom.",

Substrate regions 184a and 184b may be highly doped with donors to form an electron reservoir. Metallic contacts 186a and 186b may set the Fermi energy level of those reservoirs. Applying a highly positive voltage to gates 187a, 187b and 188 generates an electron gas at the interface underneath, which contacts both reservoir regions, in a process analogous to a MOSFET turn on. Lowering the voltage on gates 187a and 187b, which are disconnected from gate 188 by the dielectric barriers 185a and 185b, depletes the electron gas under those gates, creating henceforth two tunnel barriers. Conduction then happens via single electrons, in which case structure 181 may constitute a single electron transistor (SET).",
                        "Donors are placed, using for example ion implantation, under the metallic gates 188b. Each of those gates can be on top of one or a few donors. Gates 188b control the electron wavefunction, which can be displaced between donor and interface as described before. Single qubit operations may be performed by applying AC voltages to gates 188b. Two qubit operations are done via electric dipole-dipole coupling between nearby qubits, each of them belonging to different qubit units.",
                        "Uncertainties in vertical misplacement of each donor translate into uncertainties in the dipole moment ed and tunnel coupling Vt, whereas lateral placement uncertainties changes the electric dipole-dipole coupling gdd between neighboring qubits. The optimum conditions for two qubit coupling are not substantially modified if gdd is altered by an order of magnitude. This translates into a tolerance in donor placement of \u02dc8 nm vertically and many tens of nm laterally, below which the computer performance is not substantially affected. These limits are compatible with the uncertainty in donor placement achieved with ion implantation techniques.",
                        "The single donor qubit may be realised using counted ion implantation. In this case, individual extra gates 186c and 186d may be present at each qubit unit in order to tune the tunnel coupling to the interface. This is shown in detail in FIG. 19, where panels 192, 194 and 196 show electron wavefunction, shared between donor and interface, inside dashed rectangle in structure 182, for three different voltage combinations applied to gates 186c and 186d of FIG. 18(c). The interface state can be displaced laterally by many tens of nanometers, reducing the overlap between donor and interface wavefunctions, therefore reducing Vt by a few orders of magnitude. Another possibility to increase Vt is to keep an extra even number of electrons at the interface. In this way, the donor electron has a wider wavefunction extension when at the interface, which increases its tunnel coupling to the donor. Also, multiple donors can be implanted per processing element, in which case the most convenient the donor can be individually chosen.",
                        "Quantum processing may involve a great sequence of steps. While qubits are not being operated, the information can be \u2018stored\u2019 in the nuclear spin, which may be ionized by using top gates. Ionized nuclear spins are the most coherent of the available qubits used here, and among the most coherent of any quantum system. Loading an electron into the donor-interface system, therefore making it active to quantum operations, may be done by inducing an electron gas under gate 188, and then moving this gas closer to the qubit by changing the voltage on neighbouring gates 186c and/or 186d. In order to better electrically isolate qubits or pairs of qubits when performing operations, an electron gas can circumvent qubits or pairs of qubits and therefore screen is electric interaction with neighbouring stray qubits. Read-out of the qubit spin states may be performed by spin-dependent tunnelling to a reservoir, and detecting such a tunnelling event via a nearby SET.",
                        "If the nuclear spin is the one used for operations, the operation of the qubit (for 1- and 2-qubit gates) can be achieved by adiabatically pulling the electron wavefunction to the intermediate state between donor and interface using biasing conductive electrodes 188b.",
                        "If, instead, the flip-flop qubit is to be used for operations, the electron has to be pulled to the intermediate orbital position, and then an ESR it-pulse is applied at a frequency \u2208ff\u2212\u2208ns, which maps the nuclear spin state \u03b1|\u2193>+\u03b2|\u2193> into the flip-flop state \u03b1|\u2193>+\u03b2|\u2191>.",
                        "Referring now to FIG. 20, there is shown a schematic representation of an embodiment of quantum processor 200 comprising a plurality of qubits realised and coupled in accordance with the methods described above.",
                        "Quantum processor 200 comprises several qubit cells 205 coupled using a CPW resonators 207. Each cell may consist of a bilinear array containing a few qubits. The exploded view 205 of a qubit cell shows the internal architecture of the cell. A bottom view 201 of the cell, that does not show the substrate or interfacing oxide for clarity, shows the donor atoms 202 and a schematic representation of the respective electron wave functions. View 201 also shows all metallic gates that form single electron transistors 204, top-gate electrodes 206, confinement and tunnel coupling gates 208, electron reservoir 209 and CPW resonator 203. In this quantum processor, 2-qubit gates are performed within a cell via electric dipole-dipole interactions, where two qubit belonging to the extremities of different cells can be coupled via a common microwave resonator.",
