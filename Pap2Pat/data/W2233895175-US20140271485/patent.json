The standard method is bioluminescence imaging using \u03b2-cell firefly luciferase expression and the substrate luciferin. Although this technique does quantify \u03b2-cell masses, it cannot be efficiently applied to a variety of transgenic mouse strains. Thus, there is a need for a broadly applicable, strain non-specific, bioluminescent imaging tool that will enable researchers to study a \u03b2-cell mass in the context of development, disease or transplantation.",
                        "An important area in diabetes research is the development of a targeted imaging probe that is highly sensitive, specific and suitable for diagnostic \u03b2-cell mass imaging. In the process of evaluating a diabody-based, \u03b2-cell imaging tool, a novel application for the luciferase substrate coelenterazine was found, namely the ability to detect a functional \u03b2-cell mass."

The cells normally produce the hormone that is released daily at about 40 to 50 Units. The Islets have several hundred of these cells. Insulin is stored and available in vesicles within the cytoplasm of these cells, and is secreted when needed. If some \u03b2-cells are affected, that is, if only between 10% and 20% remain in good condition, the symptoms of diabetes will be displayed.",

This type of diabetes can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic. Type 1 diabetes can affect children or adults but was traditionally termed \u201cjuvenile diabetes\u201d because it represents a majority of the diabetes cases in children.",

For example, the interaction of a luminogenic protein, such as Renilla or Oplophorus luciferase or aequorin, with a coelenterazine, in the presence of O2 and at least a trace of cofactor Ca2+, will produce luminescence. The coelenterazine is oxidized to its corresponding coelenteramide during this process.",

                                "Type I and type II diabetes are chronic, debilitating and costly diseases that are increasing in prevalence worldwide. A significant limitation to the early diagnosis of type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes and staging of type II (insulin-independent) diabetes is an inability to quantify the \u03b2-cell mass of the pancreas. These \u03b2-cells, located in the pancreas, are responsible for secreting the hormone insulin in response to an elevation in blood glucose levels. Type I diabetes is associated with immune destruction of \u03b2-cells while late-stage type II diabetes is associated with progressive loss of \u03b2-cell mass subsequent to insulin resistance. The major diagnostic criterium for these diseases is hyperglycemia; however, hyperglycemia is not evident until about 90% of the functional \u03b2-cell mass is loss. Thus, there is a significant clinical need for \u03b2-cell mass imaging agents that would allow an assessment of the level of existing functional (i.e. non-diabetic) \u03b2-cells in the pancreas and, therefore, allow the selection of suitable treatment or prophylactic protocols to reduce or prevent the onset of diabetes.",
                                "Similarly, the detection of a \u03b2-cell mass in research models of type I and type II diabetes is currently limited. One of the most commonly applied techniques is post-mortem histology. This necessarily limits the assessment to a single time point, which significantly increases the number of animals needed for a given study and fails to utilize the power of longitudinal studies.",
                                "A transgenic mouse model that does permit longitudinal analysis of the \u03b2-cell mass uses the \u03b2-cell-specific expression of the firefly luciferase enzyme. Upon administration of the enzyme substrate luciferin, \u03b2-cell bioluminescence can be detected by a super-cooled CCD camera and quantified. Though this technique does permit quantification of the \u03b2-cell mass, it has no capacity for translation to human medicine. This is because it depends on the prior generation of the luciferase-expressing transgene animal, which is not possible with humans. Additionally, due to the transgenic nature of the model, its use is limited to only those mouse lines or, only after prolonged cross breeding, to another transgenic mouse line of interest.",
                                "The disclosure, however, encompasses a novel method for imaging the \u03b2-cell mass in animals and humans. Coelenterazine is a small molecule substrate typically used in conjunction with several bioluminescent luciferase enzymes including Gaussia and Renilla luciferases. This disclosure describes the use of coelenterazine or coelenterazine derivatives as a single agent (without requiring the addition of a luciferase enzyme) to image beta cell mass. It has now been found that coelenterazine administered to mice allows the generation of a pancreatic-specific bioluminescent signal that may be usefully quantified, or used as both an indicator of the presence of non-diabetic \u03b2-cells and as a means to provide images of the location of such cells in an animal body. This signal is reduced in type I diabetic mice, which have a reduction in \u03b2-cell mass, indicating that coelenterazine can be used to image \u03b2-cell mass in vivo.",
                                "Accordingly, this disclosure encompasses the use of coelenterazine and coelenterazine-like small molecules for imaging a \u03b2-cell mass in mammals. It is further contemplated to be within the scope of the disclosure for the coelenterazine or its derivatives to be have additional labeling agents attached to its structure and for small molecules developed using a coelenterazine-like small molecule structure to generate its \u03b2-cell specificity.",
                                "The disclosure describes the use of coelenterazine or coelenterazine derivatives, therefore, for the quantification of \u03b2-cell mass in human patients and/or subjects and research models. The disclosure further encompasses the use of coelenterazine, or any derivative thereof, for imaging \u03b2cells anywhere in the body or ex-vivo. Although \u03b2-cells are normally found in the pancreas, in cases of transplantation in humans they are usefully localized to the liver and in mice to the kidney capsule (also, sometimes subcutaneously or orbitally). Thus, it would be advantageous to image \u03b2-cell mass independent of their location. It is further contemplated that coelenterazine may be linked to labels such as a radionuclide for detection of the \u03b2-cells by other than just bioluminescence labeling and which could require such as PET or SPECT detection that may be used for imaging in humans.",
                                "In vitro experiments have revealed that a variety of rat insulinoma cell lines could generate a greater coelenterazine-dependent bioluminescence signal relative to other cell lines and in the absence of any additional reagents. Additionally, upon intravenous injection into mice, a mid-upper abdominal bioluminescence signal was detected, and ex vivo imaging revealed a significantly elevated pancreatic signal compared to other examined non-insulin-producing tissues of the same animal. This detectable signal intensity proved to be coelenterazine dose-dependent.",
                                "To further study the in vivo characteristics of the observed signal, the dependency upon \u03b2-cell functioning was tested. It was determined that insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells produced a greater signal compared to those cells that were quiescent due to fasting. These results supported the conclusion that the in vivo coelenterazine signal wasp-cell specific.",
                                "To conclusively determine the \u03b2-cell specificity of the signal, coelenterazine was used to image the pancreas of mice that received the \u03b2-cell toxic agent streptozotocin (STZ) versus a Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) control in which the \u03b2-cells were functional. There was a significant reduction in pancreatic signal in STZ-treated mice with both in vivo and ex vivo imaging of the pancreas. Furthermore, there was a significant and inverse correlation between the pancreatic signal and the corresponding blood glucose levels with findings similar to previous observations made in type II diabetic humans whose pancreatic mass was determined at autopsy; there appears to be a severe reduction in the \u03b2-cell mass prior to the development of hyperglycemia. These results demonstrated a novel use of coelenterazine to detect the functional \u03b2-cell mass in the STZ, type-1-diabetic mouse model.",

                                "In embodiments of this aspect of the disclosure, the method can further comprise the steps of: determining the location of the non-diabetic pancreatic \u03b2-cells within the mammal by generating an image of the emitted coelenterazine-dependent bioluminescent signal and locating the signal relative to the mammal.",
                                "Another aspect of the disclosure encompasses embodiments of a method of imaging non-diabetic pancreatic \u03b2-cells in the pancreas of a mammalian subject, comprising: (i) administering a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a coelenterazine and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to a first mammal; (ii) allowing the coelenterazine to be delivered to the pancreas of the first mammal; (iii) generating an image of a coelenterazine-dependent bioluminescent signal by the first mammal; (iv) repeating the steps (i)-(iii) on a second mammal, wherein the second mammalian subject is a non-diabetic animal; and (v) determining that the first mammal has a reduced population of \u03b2-cells and a substantial likelihood of being diabetic by determining the relative intensities of the images derived from the first and second mammals, whereby a reduction in the intensity of the detectable bioluminescent signal from the first mammal compared to the intensity of the signal from the second mammal indicates that the first mammal has a reduced population of \u03b2-cells and has a substantial likelihood of being diabetic.",
