                        "Plants are subject to multiple potential disease-causing agents, including plant-pathogenic bacteria, fungi and plant-parasitic nematodes.",
                        "Bacteria are prokaryotic single-celled microorganisms, generally ranging from 1-2 \u03bcm in size that are present on all plant surfaces (epiphytes) and inside plants (endophytes) where they can behave as beneficial or pathogenic to the host. Plant pathogenic bacteria cause many serious diseases of plants throughout the world, and their symptoms range from spots, mosaic patterns or pustules on leaves and fruits, or smelly tuber rots, crown galls to plant death. The pathogenetic bacteria Erwinia amylovora was for the first time shown in 1878 to be responsible for fireblight of apples and pears, which is nowadays a widespread disease throughout much of the temperate world. Pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes crown gall disease on a large number of hosts. Most of the plant pathogenic bacteria are either Gram-positive, classified within the Phylum Actinobacteria, or Gram-negative, in the Phylum Proteobacteria.",
                        "Fungi are eukaryotic heterotrophic micro-organisms, than can reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores and other structures. Most plant-pathogenic fungi belong to the Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycetes. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soilborne. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms. They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the genus Phytophthora, which includes the causal agents of potato late blight and sudden oak death. Particular species of oomycetes are responsible for root rot.",
                        "Nematodes are active, flexible, elongate organisms that live on moist surfaces or in liquid environments, including films of water within soil and moist tissues within other organisms. There are numerous plant-parasitic nematode species, including various root knot nematodes (e.g. Meloidogyne sp.), lesion nematodes (e.g. Pratylenchus sp.), cyst nematodes (e.g. Heterodera sp.), dagger nematodes (e.g. Xiphinema sp.) and stem and bulb nematodes (e.g. Ditylenchus sp.), among others. Tylenchid nematodes (members of the order Tylenchida), including the families Heteroderidae, Meloidogynidae, and Pratylenchidae, are the largest and most economically important group of plant-parasitic nematodes. Nematode species grow through a series of lifecycle stages and molts. Typically, there are five stages and four molts: egg stage; J1 (i.e. first juvenile stage); M1 (i.e. first molt); J2 (second juvenile stage; sometimes hatch from egg); M2; J3; M3; J4; M4; A (adult). Juvenile (\u201cJ\u201d) stages are also sometimes referred to as larval (\u201cL\u201d) stages.",
                        "Both plant-specific and animal-specific species of nematodes have evolved as very successful parasites and are responsible for significant economic losses in agriculture and livestock and for morbidity and mortality in humans. Bacterial and fungal pathogens or nematode parasites of plants can attack or inhabit all parts of plants, including roots, developing flower buds, leaves, seeds, and stems. Plant parasitic nematodes are classified on the basis of their feeding habits into the broad categories migratory ectoparasites, migratory endoparasites, and sedentary endoparasites. Sedentary endoparasites, which include the root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst nematodes (Globodera and Heterodera) induce feeding sites (\u201cgiant cells\u201d in the case of root knot nematodes and \u201csyncytia\u201d for cyst nematodes) and establish long-term infections within roots that are often very damaging to crops. Pathogenic fungi and bacteria are classified as biotrophs or necrotrophs where biotrophs colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells and necrotrophics infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells.",
                        "Compositions, methods and agents for controlling infestations by nematodes and fungal or bacterial pathogens have been provided in several forms. Biological and cultural control methods, including plant quarantines, have been attempted in numerous instances. In some crops, plant resistance genes have been identified that allow disease resistance or tolerance. Chemical compositions such as nematicides, fungicides or bactericides have typically been applied to soil in which the plant pathogens/parasites are present. However, new races of pathogens frequently evolve to break resistance genes and/or to acquire resistance against various chemicals.",
                        "There is an urgent need for safe and effective control measures. Factors relating to the disadvantages of current control strategies include heightened concern for the sustainability of agriculture, and new government regulations that may prevent or severely restrict the use of many available agricultural chemical anthelminthic, antifungal or antibacterial agents.",
                        "Chemical agents are often not selective, and exert their effects on non-target organisms, effectively disrupting populations of beneficial microorganisms and nematodes, for a period of time following application of the agent. Chemical agents may persist in the environment and only be slowly metabolized. Nematicidal soil fumigants such as chloropicrin and methyl bromide and related compounds are highly toxic. Also fungicides can be dangerous to human health, such as the dicarboximide vinclozolin, which has now been removed from use, and Zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate (Ziram), which is thought to be toxic to humans upon chronic exposure. Similarly, antibacterial agents for agricultural use such as streptomycin are increasingly being challenged, in part because they can accelerate the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations, thereby threatening livestock and human health.",
                        "These agents may also accumulate in the water table or the food chain, and in higher trophic level species. These agents may also act as mutagens and/or carcinogens to cause irreversible and deleterious genetic modifications. Thus, alternative methods for nematode, fungus or bacterium control in plants and crops are needed."

                        "The present invention relates to methods and compounds which can be used to stimulate plant defense and/or immune responses against pathogens, e.g. nematodes, bacteria and/or fungi. By acting via the plant, these compounds have a minimal impact on beneficial soil organisms, thereby making them more suitable crop protection agents. In addition, it was demonstrated that these compounds have a positive effect on plant growth and more specific on for example root and shoot development (e.g. increased number and/or height) under nematode-infected conditions. Hence, the compounds of the invention can be used to improve tolerance to pathogens, in particular nematodes, pathogenic fungi and/or bacteria. The present invention demonstrates that the compounds inhibit the attraction, invasion, migration, establishment of feeding sites, feeding proliferation and/or maturation of plant parasitic nematodes, and/or reduce lesion sites and number of feeding sites such as e.g. the production of galls or syncytia by such nematodes. It was furthermore shown that the compounds of the invention improve seedling emergence in Fusarium-infested soil, and inhibit the formation and spreading of lesions caused by phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria such as Botrytis and Pseudomonas.",
                        "The compounds of the present invention are inhibitors/inactivators of cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_180607.1), the second enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway and a member of the superfamily of Cytochrome P450 heme-thiolate proteins (Schalk et al., 1998). Hence the compounds operate by stimulating the plant defense mechanism through selective perturbation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. This was unexpected since the phenylpropanoid pathway has a critical role in plant defense and is responsible e.g. for reinforcing the cell wall upon pathogen attack, for the biosynthesis of molecules such as flavonoids that are toxic or inhibitory to nematodes and for altering the balance of plant hormones in the plant upon pathogen attack to shift resources from growth to defense. Surprisingly it was found that (temporarily) inhibiting said pathway, and especially C4H, results in a protective effect against plant pathogens, in particular plant-parasitic nematodes, fungi and/or bacteria.",
                        "In a particular embodiment, the present invention provides a method of enhancing plant immunity, in particular by inhibition or inactivation of the enzyme C4H, said method comprising the step of administering to a plant a(n) (exogenous) compound, in particular a small molecule, capable of disrupting the function or activity of C4H, e.g. by binding C4H. As used herein a \u201ccinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) inhibitor\u201d relates to a compound capable of reducing or inhibiting C4H activity in planta. As used herein the term \u201cinhibition of the activity of C4H\u201d or \u201cinhibiting C4H\u201d shall be interpreted to mean any change in a level of synthesis of the functional C4H enzyme or a C4H biological activity, which can include a reduced level of functional C4H enzyme present in a plant cell, reduced efficacy of the C4H enzyme, or any other means which affects one or more of the biological properties of a C4H enzyme such as e.g. its role in the conversion of trans-cinnamic acid into 4-hydroxycinnamic acid in plants.",
                        "Techniques for measuring and determining the (effect on) activity of C4H are well known to the one of ordinary skill in the art. Useful methods to determine inhibition of C4H activity are (incorporated by reference):\n\n\n- - Measurement of the conversion efficiency of trans-cinnamic acid\n    labeled with \u00b9\u00b3C or \u00b9\u2074C in the presence of a potential C4H inhibitor\n    in plant cell cultures or in yeast microsomes in which the CYP73A1\n    is expressed (as described in Schoch et al. 2002; Van de Wouwer et\n    al. 2016; Schalk et al. 1998). Representative inhibition kinetics\n    values obtained in cell suspensions for both competitive and\n    irreversible C4H inhibitors can be found in Table 1 in Schoch et\n    al., 2002 (incorporated by reference).\n  - Inhibition of the C4H enzyme increases the concentration of free\n    trans-cinnamic acid, which is rapidly conjugated in planta. The\n    accumulation of trans-cinnamic acid amino acid conjugates, which can\n    be quantified using HPLC-MS, can be used as a proxy measure for C4H\n    inhibition in planta. This approach is outlined in Steenackers et\n    al. 2016. Briefly, *A. thaliana* seedlings are grown in vitro on\n    medium containing 10 \u03bcM of the suspected C4H inhibitor, after which\n    they are collected, pooled and subjected to HPLC analysis.\n    Representative values for the increase in the quantity of\n    trans-cinnamic acid conjugates are found in Supplemental FIG. S2 in\n    Steenackers et al. 2016 (incorporated by reference).\n  - Inhibition of the C4H enzyme causes a compensatory upregulation of\n    the C4H gene, as shown in Example 20. Fourteen-day old rice plants\n    (*Oryza sativa* cv. Bomba) treated with foliarly twenty-four and\n    three hours prior to harvest with 100 \u03bcM of PA and MDCA showed a\n    ten-fold and three-fold increase of C4H expression in the root\n    system respectively.\n  - Primary root elongation of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings upon\n    continuous exposure to C4H inhibitors is greatly reduced. The\n    IC50-root, the dose of candidate-inhibitor required to reduce\n    primary root elongation by 50%, can be another indirect measure of\n    C4H inhibitor activity.

                        "In a further embodiment of the present invention, the compound or a composition comprising the compound is applied to a plant, directly or indirectly. Any appropriate plant part can be treated or used including plant organs (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, etc.), seeds, and plant cells and progeny of the same. In the alternative, the compound or composition can be applied to the soil surrounding the plant. The applying of the compound is prior to planting, at planting, or after planting. In one embodiment, contacting includes direct application to a plant. All or part of a plant including, without limitation, leaves, stems, seeds, roots, propagules (e.g., cuttings), fruit, etc., may be contacted with the one or more of the compounds described herein. Contacting may also be carried out indirectly, via application, e.g., to soil or other plant substrates.",
                        "Suitable application methods include high or low-pressure spraying, immersion, atomizing, foaming, fogging, coating, and encrusting. Other suitable application procedures can be envisioned by those skilled in the art. In a particular embodiment, the compounds of the invention are applied to the parts of the plant above ground or to the foliage of the plant by spraying e.g. by the use of mechanical sprayers. Sprayers convert a formulation of the invention which is mixed with a liquid carrier, such as water or fertilizer, into droplets. The droplets can be any size. Boom sprayers and air blast sprayers can also be used to apply formulations of the invention to pre-emergent or post-emergent crops. Air blast sprayers inject formulations of the invention mixed with a liquid carrier into a fast-moving air stream. Boom sprayers, aerial sprayers, ultra-low volume sprayers, drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and foggers can also be used to apply formulations of the invention. Where the formulations of the invention are in a solid, powder or granule form, they can be applied with granule or dust application equipment. Formulations of the invention can also be applied to soil, plant media, plants, plant tissues or seeds as a fumigant.",
                        "In another embodiment, seeds of a plant are coated with the compound of the invention (\u201ccoated seeds\u201d). Any appropriate seed coating method known the skilled person can be used. E.g. seeds can be treated with the compounds of the invention in multiple ways including, without limitation, via spraying or dripping, drenching, or pellet application. Spray and drip treatment can be conducted, for example, by formulating an effective amount of the compound in an agronomical acceptable carrier, typically aqueous in nature, and spraying or dripping the composition onto seed via a continuous treating system (which is calibrated to apply treatment at a predefined rate in proportion to the continuous flow of seed), such as a drum-type of treater. Such methods include those that can advantageously employ relatively small volumes of carrier so as to allow for relatively fast drying of the treated seed. Large volumes of seeds can be efficiently treated. Batch systems, in which a predetermined batch size of seed and signal molecule compositions are delivered into a mixer, can also be employed. Systems and apparatuses for performing these processes are commercially available from numerous suppliers. The present invention also provides a seed coated with one or more of the compounds/composition of the present invention.",
                        "In another aspect, the compound or composition can be applied to the soil directly, e.g. by drench application (soil drench). A soil drench applies the compound, optionally mixed with water, to the soil around the base of a plant so that its roots can absorb the compound.",
                        "In a specific embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be applied to a plant as provided herein alone, in combination or in a mixture with other compounds.

Seed size was measured using the stacking density of the seed as a proxy measure; if a given seed mass takes up a greater volume, then the individual seeds must be larger.",

In the first region, roughly equivalent to the first 140 hours after the start of measurements, the MDCA/PA-treated plants were slightly but statistically significantly smaller (p=0.011 and p=0.003 respectively). In the second region, no group was significantly taller than the other (PA: p=0.891; MDCA: p=0.237).

After harvest at 13 days after infection, the same phenotypic parameters assessed in the previous experiment were measured (see Table 6 and FIG. 5).",

Root length was also independent of shoot length (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.06).",

This measurement has a high technical error, so significant differences are difficult to obtain with small sample sizes. Cell wall mass as a percentage of total shoot dry weight also did not differ significantly between any of the treatment groups.",

Compared to untreated controls, the median number of galls was 36% lower in the PA-treated group and 28% lower in the MDCA-treated group. MDCA/PA-treated plants host significantly fewer nematodes in total, but the median number of nematodes per gall is unaffected.",

However, MDCA/PA appear to reduce the number of juveniles far more than the number of adults. This would suggest that the compounds inhibit invasion and gall establishment rather than development, in accordance with the previous experiment.",

By contrast, roughly one in ten galls were empty in MDCA/PA-treated plants. To verify that a suspected empty gall was truly empty, it was cut open with a scalpel. These empty galls were strongly associated with necrosis. Necrosis was present in roughly 75% of MDCA/PA-treated plants, but was absent in control plants. The extent of the necrosis varied greatly between plants and between individual roots. It was generally most extensive near empty or very small galls, but was also seen far away from galls as isolated spots. Several of these spots appeared to surround deceased invading J2 nematodes, but necrotic spots also occurred in areas with no visible nematode presence."

The OsWRKY proteins form a family of rice transcription factors that regulate a broad range of cellular processes, most of which are related to abiotic and biotic stress response (Jimmy and Babu, 2015). In keeping with their important role in defense, many OsWRKY genes are controlled by the plant defense hormones jasmonic acid and SA (Ryu et al., 2006; Jimmy and Babu, 2015).",

An even stronger upregulation was observed for the OsC4H gene. This points towards strong compensatory upregulation of the C4H gene in response to C4H inhibition, which might lie at the root of C4H inhibitor-mediated defense enhancement and explains why C4H inhibitors cause no significant phenotypic effects in healthy plants. Together with the observed upregulation of OsPAL4, these qPCR results suggest that C4H inhibitors trigger the phenylpropanoid pathway, an important player in plant basal immunity.",
