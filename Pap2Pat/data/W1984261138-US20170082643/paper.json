    "title": "Association of nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase mRNA expression in human adipose tissue and the plasma concentration of its product, 1-methylnicotinamide, with insulin resistance",
    "date": "2015-01-18",
    "abstract": "Nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was recently shown to be upregulated in mouse models of insulin resistance and obesity. So far, it is unknown whether NNMT is regulated in human disease. We have explored the hypothesis that white adipose tissue (WAT) NNMT expression and plasma 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) concentration are increased in human insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. NNMT expression and plasma MNA were analysed in three groups of individuals: (1) 199 patients undergoing abdominal surgery; (2) 60 individuals on a 12-week exercise programme and (3) 55 patients on a two-step bariatric surgery programme. Patients with manifest type 2 diabetes have a significantly (approximately twofold) higher NNMT expression both in omental and subcutaneous WAT compared with controls. Notably, plasma MNA correlated significantly with WAT NNMT expression in patients with type 2 diabetes (women, r = 0.59, p < 0.001; men, r = 0.61, p < 0.001) but not in healthy control individuals. In insulin-resistant individuals, there was an inverse correlation between insulin sensitivity and plasma MNA (r = 0.44, p = 0.01) or adipose tissue NNMT mRNA (r = 0.64, p < 0.001). The latter association was confirmed in a second cohort (n = 60, r = 0.78, p < 0.001). Interventions improving insulin sensitivity\u2014exercise and bariatric surgery\u2014were associated with a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in WAT NNMT expression. Bariatric surgery was also associated with a significant decrease in plasma MNA. We demonstrate that WAT NNMT expression is regulated in human insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and that plasma MNA correlates with increased tissue NNMT expression and the degree of insulin resistance, making it a potential biomarker for loss of insulin sensitivity.",

                "Increased abdominal adiposity, especially expansion of visceral adipose tissue, has been identified as a major risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [1\u20133]. How visceral adiposity contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes is not fully understood. Mechanisms that have been proposed include macrophage deposition and activation, and release of proinflammatory cytokines and NEFA that exacerbate systemic insulin resistance and loss of beta cell function (reviewed in [3, 4]).",
                "Nicotinamide, the amide form of niacin or vitamin B3, is a precursor in the synthesis of NAD+ and NADP+, which play a role in numerous biological processes like energy production, regulation of cellular redox state and circadian rhythm and longevity. Prolonged high intake of niacin or nicotinamide has been reported to reduce insulin sensitivity in individuals with normal or impaired glucose tolerance [5\u20137]. For example, individuals at risk of type 1 diabetes who were treated with nicotinamide at a dose of 2\u00a0g per day for 2\u00a0weeks showed a significant decrease in systemic insulin sensitivity, which was reversible after treatment stopped [7]. Recently, it was observed in the HPS2-THRIVE study (Heart Protection Study 2\u2013Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) that, in patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic treatment with a combination of extended-release niacin and laropiprant led to a significant increase in new-onset diabetes and disturbed glucose control in patients with established type 2 diabetes at baseline [8]. However, the mechanisms linking nicotinamide metabolism to insulin resistance are unknown. Here we explore the hypothesis that elevated nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) expression and activity may play a role in the development of human insulin resistance.",
                "NNMT is the major nicotinamide-metabolising enzyme and catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the ring nitrogen of nicotinamide thus yielding 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). NNMT is primarily expressed in the liver but is also expressed in other organs including lung, muscle, kidney, heart, skin and adipose tissue. In adipose tissue, an increase in NNMT catalytic activity was observed in mice fed a high-fat diet for 3\u00a0months [9] whereas no parallel change in liver NNMT activity was detected [9]. NNMT expression both in white adipose tissue (WAT) and in liver was recently found to be upregulated in mouse models of obesity and diabetes [10]. Of note, reduction in liver and WAT NNMT expression by treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide was shown to protect against the development of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, adipose tissue NNMT expression was found to be higher in obesity-prone vs obesity-resistant mouse strains [10].",
                "Importantly, higher urinary concentrations of the NNMT product MNA and its oxidation product N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide were observed in mouse and rat models of type 2 diabetes and in humans with type 2 diabetes [11]. However, it is still unclear whether plasma MNA concentrations are associated with adipose tissue NNMT expression, impaired insulin sensitivity or type 2 diabetes in humans. In this context we wondered whether MNA may represent a circulating biomarker of insulin resistance. We therefore investigated circulating MNA and adipose tissue NNMT expression in individuals with either normal glucose metabolism or insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in three independent cohorts: (1) a cross-sectional cohort of 199 individuals undergoing abdominal surgery; (2) an exercise-intervention cohort of 60 individuals on a 3-month exercise programme and (3) a bariatric surgery intervention cohort including 55 individuals on a two-step bariatric surgery programme. In the two intervention cohorts, we assessed whether improved glucose homeostasis and/or reduced body weight are associated with changes in adipose tissue NNMT expression and plasma MNA concentration."

Abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were calculated using MRI or computed tomography scans at the level of L4\u2013L5 in the cross-sectional study of adipose tissue donors.

                "This study demonstrates for the first time that NNMT mRNA in adipose tissue and circulating levels of the product of NNMT, MNA, were higher in humans with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes and correlated with the extent of insulin resistance. An additional novel finding is that interventions improving insulin sensitivity\u2014exercise and bariatric surgery\u2014are associated with a decrease in adipose tissue NNMT expression and, for bariatric surgery, a reduction in plasma MNA levels.",
                "Previously, higher plasma MNA levels had been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy controls 5\u00a0h after a 100\u00a0mg nicotinamide challenge [17]. Neither NNMT expression nor activity was determined in that study and higher plasma MNA concentrations were attributed to slower MNA clearance. In addition, there was no significant difference in MNA plasma concentration between the diabetic individuals and normal controls before the nicotinamide challenge. However, the study was comparatively small (N\u2009=\u200928), and no details were given regarding body weight or insulin resistance in either group of patients. Notably, prolonged treatment (2\u00a0weeks) with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide has been demonstrated to cause insulin resistance in individuals with NGT or IGT [5\u20137]. Although no MNA plasma concentrations were measured in these clinical studies, experiments in rats demonstrated that nicotinamide administration results in a marked increase in plasma MNA concentration [17, 18], indicating that a similar rise in plasma MNA can be expected in humans. Interestingly, administration of either nicotinamide or MNA to healthy rats had very similar effects on glucose homeostasis, leading to an increase in both blood glucose and insulin concentrations. This suggests that the loss of insulin sensitivity upon nicotinic acid or nicotinamide treatment could be mediated by MNA.",
                "Higher urinary MNA concentrations were observed in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy controls and also in db/db mice and obese Zucker rats [11] and mice on high-fat diet [19].",
                "Importantly, we observed a correlation between plasma MNA levels and adipose tissue NNMT expression only in individuals with type 2 diabetes or high BMI but not in those without diabetes or who had lower BMI (Fig.\u00a02 and ESM Fig.\u00a01). Although the underlying mechanisms for this observation are not clear, we postulate that individuals without diabetes may be able to mitigate the influence of high WAT NNMT expression on plasma MNA levels by a mechanism that is compromised in patients with diabetes. Alternatively, the contribution of WAT NNMT to circulating MNA concentrations relative to other organs, especially liver, may be higher in insulin-resistant or diabetic individuals. This would be in line with a report by Riederer et al [9] demonstrating that high-fat feeding of mice leads to a selective increase in WAT NNMT activity whereas activity in the liver remains unchanged. Moreover, mice strains known to be very susceptible to developing diet-induced obesity were found to have high WAT NNMT expression whereas WAT NNMT expression was low in obesity-resistant strains. No such relationship was observed between liver NNMT expression and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity [10]. Thus, our data may suggest that in individuals with type 2 diabetes or high BMI, WAT NNMT makes a larger contribution to circulating MNA levels\u2014leading to the observed correlation between systemic MNA and adipose tissue NNMT expression\u2013than in individuals without diabetes and with a lower BMI. In healthy lean individuals, liver NNMT activity may predominantly determine circulating MNA levels. Kraus et al [10] described higher NNMT protein levels in both WAT and liver in mouse models of type 2 diabetes or diet-induced obesity, though they did not measure NNMT activity. We cannot exclude the possibility that increased NNMT activity in the liver of patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity may, in addition to increased expression in WAT, also contribute to the observed associations in these patients. A limitation of our study is therefore that hepatic NNMT expression and activity could not be determined, because liver biopsies were not available for these cohorts.",
                "The correlation between adipose tissue NNMT expression and insulin resistance\u2014the latter being defined by a low GIR in the hyperinsulinaemic\u2013euglycaemic clamp\u2014was confirmed in two independent cohorts (see Figs\u00a03b, 4c, d). On the other hand, the association of plasma MNA levels with GIR was less robust (Fig.\u00a03d) and was only observed in insulin-resistant individuals. Therefore the value of plasma MNA as a diagnostic biomarker for insulin resistance is still limited. The cohorts analysed in our study represent a diverse clinical spectrum of obesity and insulin resistance over a broad age range. Although this disease spectrum reflects clinical reality, it may be associated with confounding factors unrelated to insulin sensitivity that could influence circulating MNA levels. Another potential limitation of our study includes the assessment of total-body fat mass and adipose tissue distribution using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), MRI or computerised tomography scans at only one defined abdominal segment. We can therefore not rule out the possibility that using whole-body MRI scans may identify additional correlations of circulating MNA and/or NNMT expression data with total-body fat mass and fat distribution. Thus, further clinical studies, preferably with more sophisticated measurements, in cohorts carefully matched by age, BMI and disease, will be required to fully explore the usefulness of MNA as a biomarker for insulin resistance and to assess its value beyond existing markers (e.g. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or HbA1c). Yet, our data already demonstrate that in individuals with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance, a high plasma MNA level indicates a high level of tissue NNMT expression and that MNA could be used to identify patients eligible for therapy with an NNMT inhibitor and to monitor their treatment response.",
                "The mechanisms by which increased NNMT activity and higher MNA levels could influence insulin sensitivity are unclear. Potential pathways may involve the generation of reactive oxygen species [17, 20, 21], an effect on cellular NAD+ levels or sirtuin activity [10, 21\u201323] or a decrease in cellular methylation potential (e.g. via lowering the SAM/SAH ratio) and resulting changes in protein and DNA methylation [10, 18, 24]. For the latter, it is notable that NNMT is overexpressed in various forms of human cancer including lung, kidney, bladder and colorectal cancer [25\u201328] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [29]. It has been suggested that MNA could provide a sink for methyl groups and that the resulting protein hypomethylation may promote oncogenesis.",
                "In summary, we have demonstrated that adipose tissue NNMT expression is increased in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and correlates with the severity of insulin resistance. Moreover, in insulin-resistant individuals, plasma MNA is a biomarker for adipose tissue NNMT expression and the extent of systemic insulin resistance. Thus, NNMT inhibition may provide a novel therapeutic approach for insulin resistance. The molecular mechanism by which NNMT could regulate insulin sensitivity is yet unknown and various possibilities are currently being investigated."
