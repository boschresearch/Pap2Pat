                        "Increased abdominal adiposity, especially expansion of visceral adipose tissue, has been identified as a major risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. How visceral adiposity contributes to the development of T2D is not fully understood, mechanisms that have been proposed include macrophage deposition and activation, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids that exacerbate systemic insulin resistance and loss of beta-cell function.",
                        "Nicotinamide, the amide form of niacin or vitamin B3, is a precursor in the synthesis of NAD+ and NADP+ that play a role in numerous biological processes like energy production, regulation of cellular redox state, circadian rhythm, and longevity. Prolonged high niacin or nicotinamide intake have been reported to reduce insulin sensitivity in subjects with normal or impaired glucose tolerance. Nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is the major nicotinamide-metabolizing enzyme but also involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics. Specifically, it catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the ring nitrogen of nicotinamide thus yielding 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). NNMT is primarily expressed in the liver but also in other organs like lung, muscle, kidney, heart, skin and adipose tissue. In the latter, an increase in NNMT catalytic activity was observed in mice fed a high-fat diet for three months (Riederer et al, Atherosclerosis, 2009, 204:412-417) whereas no change in liver NNMT activity was detected. In contrast, NNMT expression both in adipose tissue and liver was recently found to be up-regulated in mouse-models of obesity and diabetes. Of note, reduction in liver and white adipose tissue NNMT expression by treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide was shown to protect against the development of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in a mouse model (Kraus D. et al., Nature 2014 508:258-262). However, whether regulation of NNMT expression is associated with insulin resistance or T2D in humans has so far been unknown."

In the first cross-sectional cohort (n=199; 128 women, 71 men), we investigated MNA serum concentrations and NNMT mRNA expression in paired samples of subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue in relation to measures of obesity and glucose metabolism. Individuals involved in these analyses underwent abdominal surgery for weight reduction surgery, cholecystectomy, abdominal injuries or explorative laparotomy between 2009 and 2012.

In brief, each training session included 20 minutes of biking or running, 20 minutes of swimming, and 20 minutes of warming up/cooling down periods. All subjects completed a graded bicycle-ergometer test to volitional exhaustion and had maximal oxygen uptake measured with an automated open circuit gas analysis system at baseline, after 4 and 12 weeks of training. The highest oxygen uptake/minute reached was defined as the maximal oxygen uptake, and subjects subsequently trained at their individual submaximal heart rate defined as 70-80% of the individual maximal heart rate during the bicycle-ergometer test.

Overall, adipose tissue and plasma samples were collected from 199 subjects undergoing abdominal surgery, 88 of them having been diagnosed with T2D before surgery. The mean age of the study participants at the time of surgery was 55\u00b116 years, with no statistically significant difference between non-diabetic and diabetic subjects. In both sub-populations, about two thirds of the study subjects were women. Compared to the patients with T2D, non-diabetic subjects had significantly lower body weights, BMI and plasma triglyceride concentrations, and slightly higher HDL-C and LDL-C values. In line with the T2D diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c were significantly lower whereas fasting plasma insulin and glucose infusion rates in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp were significantly higher in the group without T2D.",
                                "FIG. 1 shows the association of NNMT expression in adipose tissue with the presence of T2D. In both subcutaneous and omental white adipose tissue, there was a significant, approximately two-fold increase in NNMT expression in the T2D group compared to the non-diabetic subjects, irrespective of gender. Assuming a log-normal distribution of NNMT expression, geometric mean ratios (95% confidence interval) for T2D patients compared to non-diabetic subjects were determined as 1.82 (1.22-2.72) and 1.54 (0.91-2.60) for omental adipose tissue in females and males, respectively, and 1.67 (1.16-2.41) and 1.52 (0.95-2.44) for subcutaneous adipose tissue in females and males, respectively. Interestingly, plasma MNA concentrations did not correlate with either omental (FIG. 2A, 2B) or subcutaneous (FIG. 3A, 3B) adipose tissue NNMT expression in non-diabetic subjects. However, there was a statistically significant positive association (R=0.6, p<0.001) between plasma MNA concentration and adipose tissue NNMT expression in both adipose depots and for both women and men (FIG. 2C, 2D, 3C, 3D). The reason for this difference between non-diabetic and T2D patients is not clear. Potentially, in non-diabetic subjects a major part of MNA in plasma may come from the liver, with a lower contribution by adipose tissue, whereas in individuals with T2D adipose tissue may become a more predominant source of MNA. This would be in line with observations in mice on a high-fat diet where a selective increase in adipose tissue but not in liver NNMT activity was observed (Riederer et al, Atherosclerosis, 2009, 204:412-417). Interestingly, although there was no significant dependence of adipose tissue NNMT expression on BMI, MNA concentrations strongly correlated with omental or subcutaneous adipose tissue NNMT expression for subjects with a BMI above the median BMI of 39 (R=0.56 for omental, R=0.5 for subcutaneous adipose tissue NNMT, p<0.001 each) but less so for subjects with a BMI below median (R=0.24, p=0.02 for omental, R=0.15, p=0.15 for subcutaneous adipose tissue) which also points towards a higher contribution to MNA plasma levels of adipose tissue NNMT compared to liver NNMT in obese subjects (FIG. 6C, 6D, 6A, 6B).",
                                "In subjects for which hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp data were available (N=85), NNMT expression in omental adipose tissue was about 3.5-fold higher in subjects with insulin resistance (N=32, p<0.001) compared to insulin-sensitive individuals (N=53) where insulin resistance was defined by a glucose infusion rate (GIR) lower than 50 \u03bcmol/kg/min (FIG. 4A). In contrast, the difference in subcutaneous adipose tissue NNMT mRNA between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive subjects did not reach statistical significance (p=0.3). In the group of insulin-resistant subjects, we observed a strong correlation between the extent of insulin resistance\u2014defined by the lower GIR compared to insulin-sensitive subjects\u2014and the expression level of NNMT in omental adipose tissue (FIG. 4B, R=0.64, p<0.001). A similar but somewhat less pronounced (R=0.4, p=0.02) association was observed between low GIR and expression of NNMT in subcutaneous adipose tissue (FIG. 7). As there was also a positive association between plasma MNA concentrations and adipose tissue NNMT expression in this study group (FIG. 4C, R=0.66, p<0.001), plasma MNA levels significantly correlate with the degree of insulin resistance (FIG. 4D, R=0.44, p=0.01). Thus, in insulin-resistant individuals, plasma MNA concentration could potentially be used as a soluble biomarker for adipose tissue NNMT expression and the extent of whole-body insulin sensitivity.",
                                "Of note, the association between adipose tissue NNMT expression and insulin resistance could be confirmed in a separate cohort (N=60, 20 each of NGT, IGT and T2D subjects) of subjects that enrolled for a 12-week exercise intervention program consisting of three one-hour bouts of exercise per week (20 min endurance and 40 min resistance training). Clinical and anthropometric characteristics of study subjects before and after exercise are summarized in Table 2. In all three groups\u2014NGT, IGT and T2D\u2014the physical training program led to a significant reduction in body weight, BMI, body fat content, plasma glucose levels two hours after oral glucose challenge, and basal insulin levels. As expected, compared to baseline, fasting plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower after the exercise intervention in the T2D group (5.8\u00b10.5 vs. 6.2\u00b10.6 mM, p=0.007 in paired t-test) but not in the IGT and NGT groups. Furthermore, whole-body glucose uptake was significantly higher (p<0.001) in all three groups, with larger relative improvements observed in the IGT (36\u00b116 vs. 19\u00b19 \u03bcmol/kg/min) and T2D groups (32\u00b111 vs. 21\u00b19 \u03bcmol/kg/min) compared to the NGT group (85\u00b115 vs. 76\u00b117 \u03bcmol/kg/min). Of note, adipose tissue NNMT expression was again significantly higher in patients with T2D (2.9-fold, p<0.001) or IGT (2.7-fold, p<0.001) compared to people with NGT (FIG. 5A). Importantly, the exercise program led to a significant decrease in adipose tissue NNMT expression in both IGT (\u221221%, p<0.001) and T2D subjects (\u221216%, p<0.001) but not in NGT individuals (+3%, p=0.4, FIG. 5B). There was a strong correlation between GIR and adipose tissue NNMT expression both before (FIG. 5C, R=0.78, p<0.001) and after the exercise program (FIG. 5D, R=0.70, p<0.001) confirming the association between tissue NNMT expression and the degree of insulin sensitivity that was observed in the larger cohort.",

        "1. A method of determining whether a patient with insulin resistance or type-2 diabetes (T2D) will benefit from a therapeutic treatment with an inhibitor of nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT), said method comprising the steps:\ndetermining the level of 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) in a blood sample isolated from the patient; and\ncomparing the level of MNA in the blood sample with a reference level of MNA;\n\nwherein an increased MNA level in the blood sample isolated from the patient as compared to the reference level of MNA indicates that the patient will benefit from said therapeutic treatment.",
        "2. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference level is an average MNA level determined from at least two reference samples from healthy subjects.",
        "3. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein an increase of the MNA level in the blood sample isolated from the patient by at least 20% as compared to the reference level of MNA indicates that the patient will benefit from said therapeutic treatment.",
        "4. The method of claim 1, wherein the reference level is at least 100 nmol/L.",
        "5. A method of determining whether a patient with insulin resistance or type-2 diabetes (T2D) responds to a therapeutic treatment with an inhibitor of nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT), said method comprising the steps:\ndetermining the level of 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) in a blood sample isolated from the patient; and\ncomparing the level of MNA in the blood sample with a pre-treatment level of MNA;\n\nwherein a decrease of the MNA level in the blood sample isolated from the patient as compared to the pre-treatment level of MNA indicates that the patient responds to said therapeutic treatment; and\nwherein the patient is a patient to whom at least once an inhibitor of NNMT is administered or has been administered.",
        "6. The method of claim 5, wherein the blood sample is isolated from the patient after an inhibitor of NNMT has been administered to said patient.",
        "7. The method of claim 5 or 6, wherein the pre-treatment level is determined in a blood sample isolated from the patient before an inhibitor of NNMT has been administered to said patient.",
        "8. The method of any one of claims 5 to 7, wherein a decrease of the MNA level by at least 10% in the blood sample isolated from the patient as compared to the pre-treatment level of MNA indicates that the patient responds to said therapeutic treatment.",
        "9. A method of adjusting the dose of a therapeutic drug applied for therapeutic treatment of insulin resistance or type-2 diabetes (T2D) in a patient comprising the steps:\ndetermining the level of 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) in a blood sample isolated from the patient; and\ncomparing the level of MNA in the blood sample with a pre-treatment level of MNA;\n\nwherein the patient is a patient to whom at least once an inhibitor of NNMT is administered or has been administered; and\nwherein said therapeutic drug is an inhibitor of nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase (NNMT).",
