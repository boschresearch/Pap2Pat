    "abstract": "A good physical map is essential to guide sequence assembly in de novo whole genome sequencing, especially when sequences are produced by high-throughput sequencing such as next-generation-sequencing (NGS) technology. We here present a novel method, Feature sets-based Genome Mapping (FGM). With FGM, physical map and draft whole genome sequences can be generated, anchored and integrated using the same data set of NGS sequences, independent of restriction digestion. Method model was created and parameters were inspected by simulations using the Arabidopsis genome sequence. In the simulations, when ~4.8X genome BAC library including 4,096 clones was used to sequence the whole genome, ~90% of clones were successfully connected to physical contigs, and 91.58% of genome sequences were mapped and connected to chromosomes. This method was experimentally verified using the existing physical map and genome sequence of rice. Of 4,064 clones covering 115 Mb sequence selected from ~3 tiles of 3 chromosomes of a rice draft physical map, 3,364 clones were reconstructed into physical contigs and 98 Mb sequences were integrated into the 3 chromosomes. The physical map-integrated draft genome sequences can provide permanent frameworks for eventually obtaining high-quality reference sequences by targeted sequencing, gap filling and combining other sequences.",

                "Since 2005, the number of registered genome sequencing projects has doubled every two years, reaching 11,472 as of September, 2011 [1]. Recent projects have expended a tremendous amount of effort to sequence more complex genomes [2]. Many projects aimed to generate reference genome sequences for the genus or species of interest. A reference genome sequence is an important tool to explore genome structure and function, identify genomic variations, infer information about species evolution, and guide the genome assembly of closely related species [3\u20138]. However, in all cases, the high quality of a reference genome sequence is critical to ensure reliable outcomes [9].",
                "Two approaches, clone-by-clone (CBC) and whole genome shotgun (WGS), were developed for whole genome sequencing [10\u201313]. WGS has been widely used along with high-throughput sequencing such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies [14]. Due to the high-throughput and cost-effective nature, many genomes have been sequenced using WGS/NGS. However, this approach suffers from the key problem that the NGS reads are too short to reliably locate and order scaffolds on chromosomes and complete chromosome assemblies, especially when a genome is large and contains an abundance of repetitive sequences, large gene families, and extensive segmental duplications [5]. As the development of the single-molecule sequencing or the third generation sequencing technology, longer sequencing reads and more continuous contigs could be obtained [15\u201317]. However, the technology alone is still difficult to complete sequences of complex genomes at the present. CBC does not suffer from these problems and is considered a \u201cgold standard\u201d for genome sequencing [18, 19]. In the CBC approach, a physical map is first constructed using large-insert clones, mainly bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) [20] and used as a framework for the allocation of assembled sequences to chromosomes [10, 12, 21]. Physical clone maps are also important tools for locating genes for map-based cloning [22, 23], assembling genomic repeats [24] and filling gaps [25].",
                "Fingerprinting technology has been widely used for physical clone mapping [26\u201328]. In this technology, large insert clones such as BACs are fingerprinted with restriction enzyme(s), and the shared restriction bands are used to identify overlaps between clones [29]. This technology has been implemented in automated and high-throughput systems [26]. However, it is costly and has a limited resolution for large genome mapping [30]. Optical mapping [31], nanochannel genome mapping [32] and whole genome profiling (WGP) [30] methods have been developed as alternatives to construct BAC physical maps. But they, as well as fingerprinting, were all designed specifically for physical mapping only and are based on restriction digestion. Uneven distributions of restriction sites throughout genomes, and possible ineffective or incomplete digestion would thus influence the outcomes.",
                "Previously, to integrate physical map with sequence map [33] or gene map [34], separate data sets or projects for physical mapping and sequencing were needed. Here we present a novel method, Feature sets-based Genome Mapping (FGM). With FGM, physical clone map-integrated draft whole genome sequence can be generated, assembled and anchored using the same set of NGS sequences, independent of restriction digestion. This method has tremendous advantages over other existing methods and is expected to be used to construct de novo reference sequences for a broad range of species."

First, to find and optimize the most critical parameters, many simulations were processed in silico. In these simulations, it was critical to keep true feature sequences (FSs) and k-mers and remove false ones when resolving the feature sequence set (FS-sets) and the k-mer set (K-sets) of each clone. Then, a genome sequence from a simulation with a given critical parameter combination was obtained, and the original and simulated assembled genome sequences were compared to verify the effectiveness of the method. Finally, an experiment was performed with the critical parameter combination to test the difference between the theoretical and experimental results."

A total of 10,000 BAC clones were used to analyze the frequency distribution of insert sizes. Insert sizes ranged between 60 and 300 kb; the average clone insert size was 137.42 kb and the variance was 417.54 kb2, in agreement with the designed distribution (S1 Results Section A). Sequence quality was also imported to the simulations by a quality matrix from more than 100 billion sequence reads of Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer (S1 Table).

Comparing random (Fig 2A and 2B) and solid pooling strategies (Fig 2C and 2D) (defined in the S1 Material and Methods Section A List 2), the curves of detection rates of F-sets of clones are similar. Comparing the results with sequencing errors (Fig 2A and 2C) and without (Fig 2B and 2D), sequencing errors have an enormous effect on the detection of F-sets. For a critical detection rate value of 0.98, sequencing depths of 11X, 12X and 13X are enough for the pool dimensions of 3D, 6D and 9D without sequencing errors, but 16X, 18X and 19X are necessary with sequencing errors (S2 Table). In terms of probability, larger pool dimensions reduce the number of false positives and decrease the detection rate. To guarantee the detection of enough elements in F-sets, a sequencing depth of 19X is sufficient for a critical detection rate of 0.98 for 9D pooling.",

A statistical analysis of the frequency in the screened pools\u2019 F-sets was performed, indicating that most false elements imported by sequencing errors occurred only one time (S3 Table).

                                "When combining clones into pools, the pool coverage, the ratio of total insert size of all clones in the given pool to genome size, should be limited. Greater pool coverage results in more false elements in clones\u2019 intersected F-sets and the retention of fewer true elements (FSs or k-mers) in final F-sets. To obtain the best possible pool coverage, we inspected pool coverage at different discrete values with 3 pooling dimensions.",
                                "A new concept, the correct rate of the clone\u2019s F-set, is defined as the ratio of the true element number in resolved F-sets to the size of real sets. More than 99.6% of elements were detected in clones\u2019 intersected F-sets for all pool dimensions (Fig 3A and 3C) under the sequencing conditions given above. However, many elements were false, as reflected by the correct rate. The correct rate of clones\u2019 intersected F-sets was lower with greater pool coverage, especially for 3D pooling (pools\u2019 demission is 3D, S1 Material and Methods Section A List 2). Too many false elements were present in intersected F-sets to contig clones and locate sequences. Refining step removed most false elements while most true elements were retained in the final F-sets if the pool coverage for 6D and 9D pooling was limited (Fig 3B and 3D). Overall, the correct rate decreases with increasing pool coverage. For 3D pooling, the detection rate was less than 20%, and the correct rate was less than 10% when the pool coverage was greater than 0.27. For 6D pooling, the correct rates are 89.01% and 73.02% for the final FS-set and the final K-set, respectively, when the pool coverage is 0.30. Compared to 3D and 6D pooling, the correct rate in the clones\u2019 F-sets is much higher for 9D pooling, decreasing more slowly with increasing pool coverage.",

Then a statistical analysis of clone usage was carried out to determine the effect of pool coverage (Fig 4). Clone usage is the ratio of the number of clones in contigs to all clones imported to FPC. Each curve on the statistics of clone usage exhibited a rise and fall and included a maximum value; the maximum values were 52.20%, 96.09% and 99.39% at 0.17, 0.20 and 0.30 for 3D, 6D and 9D pooling, respectively. Therefore, we designated 90% as the critical value of clone usage, and subsequent simulations were performed at this value.

                        "During constructing a BAC physical map with fingerprinting, the restriction bands are used as landmarks to determine clone overlap [26]. According to the overlapping algorithm [35, 40], a larger number of total landmarks enables more sensitive determination of clone overlap. For the fingerprinting method with the ABI PRISM\u00ae SNaPshot\u2122 Multiplex Kit [26], a maximum of approximately 12,000 bands from 50\u2013500 bp could be distinguished using GS500LIZ (GeneScan\u2122 500 LIZ\u00ae Size Standard, Applied Biosystems) as the size standard, and a maximum of approximately 30,660 bands from 50\u20131,200 bp could be distinguished using GS1200LIZ (GeneScan\u2122 1200 LIZ\u00ae Size Standard, Applied Biosystems) as the size standard. Compared to the fingerprinting method, optical mapping [31] and nanochannel genome mapping [32] use groups of ordered restriction bands as landmarks and WGP [30] uses sequences as landmarks, and so can significantly increase the resolution. However, all optical mapping, nanochannel genome mapping and WGP, as well as the fingerprinting method, are dependent on restriction enzyme digestion. Usually, they can generate landmarks only from the same group of restriction enzyme digestion each time, integrate only data sets from the same restriction enzyme digestion and generate only physical maps.",
                        "Optical mapping and nanochannel genome mapping can be used to generate whole genome ordered restriction/specific sequence motif maps directly using genomic DNA [41, 42] and, in this case, have multiple advantages, such as omitting cloning of large insert DNA fragments, providing potentially very long scaffolds and discerning genome wide DNA methylation profiles [43\u201345]. However, these maps are not determinative and cannot provide DNA templates for sequence completion. They usually can only be used to validate the well-preassembled sequence and flag the differences. On these physical maps, the landmarks depending on specific restriction enzymes may not be enough to comprehensively align and validate the preassembled sequences of complex genomes. Therefore, other powerful resources are sorely desired for completion of complex genome sequences.",
                        "Our method does not require restriction enzyme digestion and can use any sequence as the prefix sequence(s). Many more sequence landmarks (FSs) can be detected using our method. For example, if the FS length is 30 and the prefix sequences are \u201cGGATCC\u201d, \u201cGAATTC\u201d, \u201cTCTAGA\u201d and \u201cCTCGAG\u201d, 464,353 FSs can be detected in the rice genome (Oryza sativa ssp. Japonica Nipponbare, build 5) and 1,640,376 FSs can be detected in the maize genome (Zea mays ssp. Mays, version 2, http://www.maizesequence.org). The omission of the restriction digestion step significantly simplifies the experiment, avoiding problems associated with the distribution of restriction sites throughout the genome and enzyme digestion, and reducing cost. FSs are absolute values without errors, different from the restriction digestion-dependent landmarks that could contain errors introduced by experimental conditions, reaction systems, size determination and manipulations. When contiging clones according to FS-sets, it is very easy to determine whether one FS is shared by other clones. Meanwhile, the tolerance value in assembly programs (such as FPC) related to the size resolution of gel or capillary electrophoresis should be set to 0 and so different FSs/bands can be easily distinguished. Most importantly, our method can easily integrate different data sets by selecting the same prefix sequence(s) and generate simultaneously de novo physical maps and draft whole genome sequences of complex genomes. The physical map-integrated draft genome sequences provide permanent frameworks and can be completed by targeted sequencing, gap filling and combining the sequences of the same genome produced by any other techniques, such as Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer and Pacbio RS system. Many draft genome sequences generated mainly by WGS/NGS were published. Although much cheaper than those generated by CBC method, these draft genome sequences still spent large amounts of money. However, they are usually fragmented unfinished products and cannot be significantly improved by increasing sequencing coverage or by physical maps generated by the restriction enzyme-dependent methods. Without further improvement, these draft genome sequences will have a limited use.

                        "An important goal of FGM is to obtain a more accurate genome map and genome sequence while sequencing fewer pools. First, the F-set of each clone in pools should be detected and resolved. There is no doubt that increasing the number of true elements (FSs or k-mers) and decreasing the number of false elements in F-sets of clones increases the accuracy of the physical map and genome sequence.",
                        "Sequencing depth is a decisive factor for the detection rate of F-sets for pools and clones. Greater sequencing depth increases the detection rate of F-sets but also increases the number of false elements in F-sets. Other main factors including sequencing errors and pooling dimension also affect the detection rate. Larger pooling dimensions help to remove false elements in clones\u2019 intersected F-sets and to preserve more true elements (FSs or k-mers) in the final F-sets, but result in lower detection rates. Before intersecting the F-sets of pools, elements in F-sets should be filtered because many false elements are imported due to sequencing errors. More than 70% of false elements in the F-sets of pools could be removed at the filtering frequency of 1, increasing the correct rate of F-sets of pools up to 97%. If the sequencing depth for each pool increases, then the filtering frequency of 2 or greater is necessary to be used to filter errors. Pool coverage is another critical factor that affects the ability to resolve clones\u2019 final F-sets. Obviously, 9D pooling produces more accurate F-sets of clones than 6D pooling at the same pool coverage, but it requires sequencing many more pools, increasing cost. It is worthy to note that 2D pooling is much simpler, but also requires sequencing many more pools. As the costs for the construction of sequencing libraries and for NGS reduce, 2D pooling can be considered. Therefore, the determination of pool dimension should be based on a balance between cost and accuracy/simplicity.",
                        "The integration of assembled NGS sequences was carried out using a new strategy that allocates assembled sequences to bins on physical contigs, which is different from the previous BAC pooling methods that assembled sequence scaffolds with BAC clones in random [46] or in a minimum tiling path [47]. Most sequence contigs were not only assigned to physical contigs but also ordered and oriented by bin locations. However, errors are still unavoidable. At the level of the physical contig, the orientation of physical contigs can only be confirmed when two or more molecular markers are available on each physical contig. At the level of the sequence contig, the location and orientation of sequence contigs can only be confirmed when paired-end matches spanning close bins are available or when sequence contigs are assigned at a junction of two bins.",
                        "Beside the parameters listed above, other parameters such as genome size, read length, FS length and physical map coverage should also be considered. The parameters and suggestions resulted from this work are summarized (S5 Table), and can serve as a reference for future work.",
                        "In the experiment conducted with our method, although we used only approximately 3X genome coverage clones and one 500 bp-size sequencing library for NGS, we still obtained a physical map of chromosome 1, 2 and 4 of rice 93\u201311 containing 452 contigs and 3,364 BAC clones, and obtained approximately 92 Mb sequences and allocated approximately 95.65% (88 Mb) of them to physical contigs. The clone usage is approximately 82.12%, which is much better than the result of fingerprinting technology. Actually, it\u2019s almost impossible to construct a feasible physical map with fingerprinting data of 3X genome coverage clones. Nevertheless, the method may still be improved by using sequencing libraries of various sizes (e.g., 200 bp, 500 bp, 1 kb, 2 kb) and further optimizing the pooling strategy and other parameter combinations."

                "In this paper, we present a new method, FGM, which can simultaneously generate de novo physical maps and physical map-integrated draft genome sequences using the same NGS data sets. The physical map-integrated draft genome sequences provide permanent frameworks for eventually obtaining high-quality reference sequences by targeted sequencing, gap filling and combining other sequences of the same genomes. Data sets produced by any other techniques from different projects for the same genome can be integrated easily because the FSs and k-mers are absolute values. This feature makes our method unique in improving or saving the existing draft genome sequences generated by WGS/NGS. Compared with the traditional CBC strategy, this method reduces cost, increases efficiency, and improves the compatibility of data when creating physical maps. Compared to WGS/NGS, the assembled sequences can be precisely located, oriented, and connected based on the physical maps, which is important for filling gaps subsequently by map-guided targeted sequencing or by the integration of long Sanger or third-generation sequence reads. This method combines the advantages of CBC and WGS/NGS, avoids their shortcomings, and is expected to be used for a broad range of species."
