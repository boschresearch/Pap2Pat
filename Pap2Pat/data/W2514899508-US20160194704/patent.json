It is the most complicated step in the whole sequencing process. Therefore, the application of such a whole-genome sequencing strategy is greatly restricted.",

However, WGS method has the following disadvantages: the read length of the sequence is too short, the calculation during sequence assembly is too complex and difficult, and the assembled sequence contains lots of gaps which are very difficult to fill up. In addition, it is hard to position the obtained scaffold on chromosomes and determine the relative positions thereof in the absence of reference sequences.",

Then calculate the intersection A1\u2032 of P1\u2032, P2 and P5\u2032, as shown in FIG. 10D. Finally the original k-mer set of A1 minuses A1\u2032 to get the final k-mer set A1\u02dc of A1, as shown in FIG. 10E. The dark color part in the figure is the final k-mer set of A1.",

                        "After the above calculation, A1\u02dc is the final k-mer set of clone A1, and calculation of the final k-mer set of clones A2-A8 are conducted in the same way.",
                        "In the above example, when calculating the intersection of the k-mer set of the mixing pool to obtain the k-mer set A1 of clone A1, if the real k-mer set of clone A6, A4 and A7 contains common k-mers, the mixing pool P1, P2 and P5 also contain the common k-mers. When computing A1, the k-mer will also be assigned to A1. But in fact, the common k-mers of the three clones does not belong to clone A1, which introduces the false k-mers in A1. The false k-mers need to be removed, so step 3-5 are needed. If the real k-mer set of A1 and the real k-mer sets of A6, A4 and A7 have the common k-mers, the common k-mer also will appear in B1\u2032, B2\u2032 and B5\u2032, namely A1\u2014obtained by intersecting the three sets will also contain the k-mers. After the calculation of step 5, the k-mers will be removed from A1, that is, the real k-mers are removed from A1. Therefore from step 3-5, when removing the false k-mers, some real k-mers are also removed. Though the final k-mer set of clone obtained through the above calculation will lose some k-mers compared to the real k-mer set of clone, the elements in the final k-mer set all belong to the real k-mer set, that is, it does not contain the false elements.",
                        "The premise of the above derivation is in the ideal case that the sequence of all the clones in each pool can be detected, the k-mers of each clone can also be detected, and there is no sequence error. But in fact, due to the influence of the experimental conditions, sequencing errors and the randomness of sequencing, the ideal situation is impossible to achieve. So, A1 cannot contain all the real k-mers belonging to C1. Similarly, the k-mer set of other clones cannot contain all of their real k-mers. Therefore it will lead to that BP will lose some k-mers belonging to the mixing pool P1, and B2\u2032 and B5\u2032 in the same way will lose some k-mers belonging to P2 and P5 respectively. When compute the intersection of B1\u2032, B2\u2032 and B5\u2032 to get A1\u22121, A1\u2212 will lose some k-mers. When the missing k-mers belong to A1, but do not belong to the real k-mer of P1, these errors will be retained in the final k-mer set A1\u02dc of P1, that is, the false positive is introduced in A1\u02dc. For the introduced false k-mer set due to sequencing errors, before analyze the k-mer set of clones, it is required to use the frequency of k-mer appeared in the k-mer set of the mixing pool to filter. That is, if the occurrence of a certain k-mer in the set is less than a certain value, it is considered that the k-mer is introduced due to sequencing errors, so as to remove most of the false k-mers in the k-mer set of the mixing pool. Filter frequency is related to sequencing depth and sequencing errors. The greater sequencing depth is, the more sequencing errors are, and the greater filter frequency is. If the sequencing error is less than 3%, the sequencing depth is 20 times, and the filter frequency selects 1, which can filter most of the false k-mer.",
                        "Taking into account the introduction of false positive of the final k-mer set of clones, it is needed to increase the sequencing depth in order to detect the real k-mer contained in each hybrid pool as much as possible. As far as possible exclude the false positive in the final k-mer set. When calculate the excluded union set of specific clones, balance the union set, which is called as balancing the k-mer set of mixing pools.",

Put the elements in the intersected set of all the clone k-mers in the mixing pool in one KV-set, the frequency of all the elements is 1. When calculate the union set of the intersected set of clone k-mers (step 3 in the above example), calculate the sum of the KV-set of all clones in the mixing pool to get the KV-set of the mixing pool. Then compare the key in KV-set of mixing pool and the elements in the original k-mer set of mixing pool, add the elements included in the original k-mer set but not in KV-set into KV-set, set the frequency of the newly added key as 2. The KV-set obtained in this way is called a sum KV-set of the mixing pool.",

The elements in C are the elements in the intersected set of clone k-mers. Set the frequency of all the elements as 1. Assume that the sum KV-set of the mixing pool is P, P minuses C, namely P\u2032=P\u2212C, then take the key set Key (P\u2032) from P\u2032 as the union set of the mixing pool to exclude the given clone. For the above example, that is B1\u2032, B2\u2032 and B5\u2032 of the k-mer set of B1, B2 and B5 after excluding A1.",

Assuming that two clones belongs to a same contig and overlap with each other, set A represents the k-mer set of one clone, and set B represents the k-mer set of the other clone, then the two k-mer sets are divided into three sub sets, that is, a common k-mer set (A\u2229B), a specific k-mer set of A (A\u2212B), and a specific k-mer of B(B\u2212A). The relative position of the three k-mer sets are determined according that the common k-mer set is located between the two specific k-mer sets. According to this algorithm, it is possible to segment all the clone k-mer sets in each clone contig from the end into smaller sub sets according to their relative position, and the relative position of these sub sets is determined (As shown in FIG. 7).",
                        "2) Sequence Positioning and Integration",
                        "NGS sequences of the mixing pools are respectively assembled by a short sequence assembly software (such as velvet), assembly results are then merged and further assembled by a long sequence assembly software (such as PCAP) to get sequence contigs. Each sequence contig is divided into k-mer sets, intersection between the k-mer sets divided from the sequence contigs and the k-mer sets of all the blocks are computed, and blocks with a maximum number of intersection elements are obtained thereby locating the sequence contigs onto the blocks of the clone overlapping area (9 sequences from seq_1 to seq_9 shown in FIG. 7 are distributed to the relevant small blocks). In case the sequence located onto the same clone contig comprises multiple of overlapped regions, the overlapped sequences are required to be assembled and merged again, and a resulting sequence is then re-positioned.",
                        "Use double end comparison software (such as Bowtie2) to carry out double end comparison for NGS sequences of all the mixing pools and the positioned sequences (shown in FIG. 7, four pairs of double end from PE1 to PE4 are highly matched to the relative sequence). If the two sequences and the double end of a certain sequence are highly matched (such as identity value \u226797%), the two sequences are positioned in the same clone contig and the positioned contig block is in a certain range, then it is considered that the two sequences can be connected together. According to the sequencing library fragment length and the comparison results of double end, calculate the gap length between them, and use \u201cN\u201d to fill the gap. Meanwhile according to the relative position of the block of two sequences, determine the direction of the sequence after connection (in FIG. 7, seq_4 and seq_5 can be connected by two ends of PE2, expressed as seq_4-seq_5. Seq_4 and seq_5 are positioned in block bin_4 bin_5 respectively, so the direction of the sequence seq_4-seq_5 after connection can be determined). If a connection and other sequences cannot be connected by double end sequence, then compare the decomposed k-mer set and the k-mer set of the adjacent block. If it has a certain intersection with the k-mer set of the adjacent block, it can position the junction of the two blocks so as to determine its direction (in FIG. 7, seq_3 is positioned in the small block bin_3, also has larger intersection with bin_4, so it can determine the direction of seq_3 according to its intersection with the k-mer set of the two small block). Finally, according to the relative position of these sequences in blocks, connect all the positioned sequences after the double end connection into the sequence of the whole clone contig. If several sequences after double end connection are positioned in the same block, the relative position and direction between them can be randomly selected (in FIG. 7, three sequences seq_6-seq_7-seq_9 connected by PE3, PE4 and seq_8 are all positioned in bin_6, so the sequence and direction between them are not determined. Randomly select their direction and position when connect).",

The number of available feature sequences can be selected according to the needs, and the number is large, no error in the length reading of the electrophoresis bands exists.",
                        "2) The method employs NGS high throughput sequencing technology and clone mixing pool to construct the physical map of the whole-genome as well as position the assembled sequences to the physical map. In addition, all the data come from the same sequencing data set.",
                        "3) The construction of physical map and sequence assembly can be carried out simultaneously. The large genome can be divided into many small projects which are then processed simultaneously, thus improving the efficiency.",
                        "4) The complete sequence of the genome has little error in the large framework due to the presence of physical maps. For the error in the small area, the clear position can be located during the sequence assembly process which is beneficial to the gap filling and error correction of the complete sequence of genome in the future.",
                        "5) The method has more general applicability and is applicable for the shotgun sequencing (WGS) of the complete genome, the second generation sequencing technology (NGS), or the third generation sequencing technology. In addition, these sequencing methods can be integrated to make full use of their advantages in order to improve the accuracy and integrity of the sequence.",
                        "6) The method has high flexibility, because the feature sequence is an absolute value. The feature sequences can be easily added and integrated to further improve the genome sequence."

        "1. A whole-genome sequencing method based on clone DNA mixing pool, the method comprising:\n1) extracting a whole-genome DNA and constructing a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library;\n2) constructing BAC clone mixing pools;\n3) extracting DNA of the BAC clone mixing pools;\n4) performing pair-end sequencing for the DNA extracted from the BAC clone mixing pools in 3) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequences;\n5) scanning sequences of each of the mixing pools to obtain a feature sequence set and a k-mer set of each mixing pool;\n6) analyzing a corresponding feature sequence set and a corresponding k-mer set of each clone according to the feature sequence set and the k-mer set of the mixing pools;\n7) constructing clone contigs according to feature sequence sets of clones;\n8) dividing the k-mer sets of the clones into small k-mer sets by the clone contigs and positioning the small k-mer sets onto the clone contigs;\n9) assembling the NGS sequences in the mixing pool of 3) to yield sequence contigs;\n10) positioning the sequence contigs onto the clone contigs, using sequenced paired-end information to connect the sequence contigs and determining directions thereof, to obtain sequences of the clone contigs; and\n11) determining relative positions and directions of the clone contigs by molecular markers, and connecting the sequences of clone contigs as whole stripe of chromosome sequences to obtain whole-genome sequences;\nwherein\nalgorithms for analyzing the feature sequence sets and the k-mer sets of the clones are as follows:\na total number of clones of the BAC library of a certain species is defined as a, and a total number of the constructed mixing pools is defined x, then:\nthe k-mer set of the mixing pool at a \u03ba-th dimension and having an index of \u03bb is expressed as: P(\u03ba,\u03bb);\nthe k-mer sets of the mixing pools comprising a given clone are expressed as: {P(\u03b4)|\u03b4<m, P(\u03b4)\u03b5P};\nan intersection set of k-mer sets of the mixing pools comprising the give clone, namely an initial k-mer set of the given clone, is expressed as: C\u03c4=\u2229\u03b4=1xP(\u03b4);\nan excluded union k-mer set (EUKS) of the given clone in the mixing pools is expressed as: C(\u03ba,\u03c4)=\u222a\u03bd=0aC\u03bd (\u03bd\u2260\u03c4,0<\u03bd<a);\nan intersection set of all excluded union k-mer sets (EUKS) of the given clone is expressed as: CI\u03c4=\u2229\u03ba=0xCU(\u03ba,\u03c4); and\na final k-mer set (FKS) of the given clone is: CF=C\u03c4\u2212CI\u03c4.",
        "2. The method of claim 1, wherein\nan algorithm for division of the clone contigs is as follows: the k-mer sets of the clones are segmented into blocks according to relative positions of the clones in the clone contigs; assuming that two clones belongs to a same contig and overlap with each other, set A represents the k-mer set of one clone, and set B represents the k-mer set of the other clone, then the two k-mer sets are divided into three sub sets, that is, a common k-mer set (A\u2229B), a specific k-mer set of A (A\u2212B), and a specific k-mer of B (B\u2212A); the relative position of the three k-mer sets are determined according that the common k-mer set is located between the two specific k-mer sets; and\nan algorithm for positioning and integration of sequences is as follows: NGS sequences of the mixing pools are respectively assembled by a short sequence assembly software, assembly results are then merged and further assembled by a long sequence assembly software to get sequence contigs; each sequence contig is divided into k-mer sets, intersection between the k-mer sets divided from the sequence contigs and the k-mer sets of all the blocks are computed, and blocks with a maximum number of intersection elements are obtained thereby locating the sequence contigs onto the blocks of the clone overlapping area; in case the sequence located onto the same clone contig comprises multiple of overlapped regions, the overlapped sequences are required to be assembled and merged again, and a resulting sequence is then re-positioned."
