- describe method steps: extracting DNA, constructing BAC library, constructing mixing pools, sequencing, analyzing feature sequence sets and k-mer sets
- define k-mer set and feature sequence set
- explain calculation of final k-mer set and feature sequence set
- describe excluded union k-mer set and final k-mer set calculation
- illustrate example of calculating final k-mer set using graphs
- discuss limitations of method due to sequencing errors
- explain filtering false k-mers using frequency of k-mer appearance
- describe balancing k-mer set of mixing pools
- outline advantages of whole-genome sequencing method
