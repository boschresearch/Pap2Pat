                        "How eukaryotic organisms regulate gene expression is a fundamental question in biology. It is increasingly clear that regulation of mRNA levels and their translation to corresponding proteins reflects highly coordinated, multi-layered processes. Central to all of these post-transcriptional processes, from the initial processing of a transcript in the nucleus to its final translation and decay in the cytoplasm, are a multitude of complex interactions of each transcript with numerous trans-acting RNA binding proteins.",
                        "RNA-binding proteins interact with mRNAs to form dynamic multi-component ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). These RNPs constitute the functional forms of mRNAs, and it is only through their proper formation that transcripts are correctly regulated to precisely produce the required amount of protein in a cell. The importance of RNPs to human biology, in particular, has been demonstrated by studies that show mutations disrupting the assembly of RNPs, as well as specific RNP-contained RNAs or proteins can be deleterious to cells, leading to human diseases. For example, defects in the RNA-binding proteins TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and Fused in sarcoma/Translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) have been identified in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients, as have mutations in FMR1 in those affected with Fragile X syndrome, and Tert in Dyskeratosis congenita patients.",
                        "The lack of a comprehensive picture of RNP structures in the human transcriptome is not due to a lack of effort, since numerous biochemical, genetic, and computational approaches have been utilized, alone and in combination, to identify and validate RBP interaction sites (RISs) and their interacting RBPs. What has substantially hindered progress in this field is the fact that RIS structures are often short, highly degenerate, and dependent on secondary structures, making definitive mapping difficult by conventional means. Biochemical techniques to identify precise in vivo occupancy of these sequences remains laborious, and the fact that most of the hundreds of predicted RNA binding proteins have no known function, makes it challenging to determine the true prevalence and regulatory importance of most RNA-protein interactions (Lebedeva et al., 2011; Mukheree et al., 2011, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth).",
                        "Currently utilized methods for identifying RNA-protein interactions involve purification of a specific RNA-binding protein followed by interrogation of RNAs bound thereto using subsequent sequencing or microarray hybridization. These currently employed approaches include RNA immunopurification followed by microarray hybridization (RIP-chip), high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (PAR-CLIP), etc. (Lebedeva et al., 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2011, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth). Although these approaches have proven useful in characterizing a few RNPs (for examples see Lebedeva et al., 2011; Mukherjee et al., 2011, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth), several drawbacks limit their applicability to global studies of RBP-RNA interactions. For instance, the protein of interest must first be identified and have previously characterized ability to bind RNA. Additionally, an antibody targeted to this single protein of interest must be used to purify the RBP and its associated RNAs. Third, because these methods rely on prior characterization of a known protein, they cannot be used with as of yet unidentified alternative RNA binding domains.",

The precise composition and formation of RNPs in eukaryotic cells is a critical node for proper gene expression regulation. Although it is apparent that RNPs are important for eukaryotic biology, a comprehensive analysis of the composition of these RNA-protein complexes has never been performed for any organism.",
                        "An approach was developed that allows the identification of RNA-protein interactions on a transcriptome-wide scale. To do this, the recently reported nuclease-based, high-throughput sequencing approach (Li et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2010, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth) was modified. By performing the innovative, transcriptome-wide, nuclease-sensitivity assays on RNAs crosslinked with their interacting proteins, all sites of RNA-protein interaction within a transcriptome of interest can be determined. Specifically, through identification of the RNA regions that are resistant to RNases (ss- and dsRNases) in the presence, but not the absence of bound proteins, the sites of protein-RNA interactions can be uncovered (FIGS. 1A-1C). In total, the data produced by the multi-faceted approach reveal the prevalence of RNA-protein interaction sites throughout a transcriptome of interest. In addition, in the process of validating the findings from this approach, numerous novel RBPs can be identified that have eluded prior studies. Embodiments herein include this approach.",
                        "Embodiments herein include methods of determining RNA-protein interaction sites within a transcriptome of interest. Methods of determining RNA-protein interaction sites may include an RNase footprinting approach. An RNase footprinting approach may include preparing an RNase footprinting library, identifying candidate protein binding sites, and identifying sequence-level motifs within the candidate protein binding sites.",
                        "A schematic of an RNase footprinting approach in FIGS. 1A-1C shows that a cross-linked RNA-binding protein protects a single-strand loop from digestion by an ssRNase. (FIG. 1A, top). An ssRNase implemented may be but is not limited to RNaseOne. However, if the bound protein is first removed by protease or proteinase digestion (FIG. 1A, bottom), this single-stranded loop is degraded by the ssRNase. A non-limiting example of an enzyme that may be implemented to remove protein is Proteinase K. By comparing the dataset from the top example in FIG. 1A to the bottom, all protein bound regions in unpaired portions of RNAs can be identified. As shown in (FIG. 1B), a dsRNase will degrade the base-paired stem in the absence of a bound protein, but not in its presence. A dsRNase implemented may be but is not limited to RNaseV1. By comparing similar datasets in FIG. 1B (top and bottom) obtained for dsRNase digestion, all protein-bound regions in paired portions of RNAs can be determined.",
                        "Preparing the RNase footprinting library. Cells of interest may be cross-linked. Cross-linking may be achieved by any suitable method including but not limited to ultra violet radiation, or formaldehyde treatment. Formaldehyde treatment may include adding 37% formaldehyde drop-wise with mixing directly to culture plates to a final concentration of 1%, and shaking the plates for 10 mins at room temperature (RT). Next, 1M glycine may be added to a final concentration of 125 mM, and the plates may be gently shaken for 5 mins at RT. Then the cells may be washed and collected in PBS. UV crosslinking may include placing a dish of cells in a Pyrex dish filled with ice (the ice may create a flat surface), removing the top of the dish, and crosslinking with 0.4 uJ using a UV crosslinker or some other UV source. Then the cells may be washed and collected in PBS. Cells prepared by any cross-linking method may be pelleted and can be frozen or used directly in the assay. Cell pellets from any cross-linking method may be formed by pooling plates of cells. For example, five plates of cells may be pooled to make each cell pellet to sample biological and technical diversity between the different plates of cells.",
                        "Preparing the RNase footprinting library may include obtaining a sample from the cell of interest. Obtaining the sample may include lysing the cell of interest to obtain the sample. The sample may be treated with DNase.",
                        "Preparing the RNase footprinting library may include lysing the cross-linked cell pellets using any suitable reagent. This may include any type of lysis buffer. For example, the cross-linked cell pellets may be lysed using RIP buffer (25 mM Tris-HCL, pH=7.4; 150 mM KCI, 5 mM EDTA, pH=7.5; 0.5% NP40; 10 \u03bcM DTT; 1 tablet protease inhibitors/10 mL) and manual grinding. The lysed samples may be treated with RNase-free DNase. A non-limiting example of such a DNase is RNase-free DNase from Qiagen; Valencia, Calif. Subsequently, the DNA-depleted fractions may be treated with either a single-stranded RNase (ssRNase) or double-stranded RNase (dsRNase) as previously described ((Li t al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2010, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth). A non-limiting example of an ssRNase is RNaseONE (Promega; Madison, Wis.). A non-limiting example of dsRNase is RNaseV1 (Ambion; Austin, Tex.). See FIGS. 1A-1C for a schematic description. Proteins may be digested by treatment with protease or proteinase (e.g. Proteinase K (Roche; Basel, Switzerland)). There may be two cell lysates for these experiments: one treated with the ssRNase and the other with dsRNase. RNase digestion may be followed by cross-link reversal. Cross-link reversal may be done through a 2-hour incubation at 65\u00b0 C. to reverse formaldehyde induced crosslinks. The digested RNA may be isolated using any suitable technique. For example, the Qiagen miRNeasy RNA isolation kit may be implemented to isolate the digested RNA by following the included protocol (Qiagen; Valencia, Calif.). Purified RNA may be used as the substrate for strand-specific sequencing library preparation, as previously described (Li et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2010). DSN library normalization may also be included per manufacturer instructions (Illumina; San Diego, Calif.).",
                        "Preparing the RNase footprinting library may include determining whether nuclease resistant regions in RNAs are due to protein binding or specific secondary structures. This may include determining the digestion patterns of ds- and ssRNases in the absence of bound proteins by producing an RNase footprinting control library. To do this, treatments may be performed as described directly above except that the cross-linked cellular lysates may be treated with protease or proteinase before being treated with an RNase. A protease or proteinase may digest the proteins and allow deduction of protein-protected sites within all detectable RNAs in the cells (FIGS. 1A-1C).",
                        "Methods of determining RNA-protein interaction sites may include identifying candidate protein binding sites. Identifying candidate protein binding sites may include a modified ChIP-seq peak calling algorithm. Specifically, normalized read coverages may be calculated for each base position in the genome and a Poisson test may be used to compute an enrichment score for \u2018protected\u2019 versus \u2018unprotected\u2019 libraries. RNA-protein interaction sites, also referred to as protein-protected sites (PPSs), may then be called by searching for regions with an enrichment score that exceeds a computed threshold. This threshold may be determined by randomly shuffling \u2018RNase footprinting\u2019 and \u2018RNase footprinting control\u2019 reads, repeating the enrichment score calculation, and selecting the top 5% of scores that emerge as peaks in the randomized data. In essence, the selected threshold acts to limit the false discovery rate (FDR) of the approach. PPSs from dsRNase-treated and ssRNase-treated samples may then be merged as a comprehensive list of protein-protected sites for that specific experiment. The functional classification of these differentially expressed regions may be determined. Predicted binding sites may be compared with previously published protein data to determine the significance of overlap as described below (see FIGS. 2A-4B).",
                        "Motif discovery and experimental validation. Methods of determining RNA-protein interaction sites may include identifying sequence-level motifs within the candidate protein binding sites. Identifying sequence-level motifs within the candidate protein binding sites may include identifying the candidate protein binding found specifically in the 5\u2032 UTR, protein-coding region and 3\u2032 UTR. These specific sets of protein binding site sequences may then be used to perform a motif search using MEME (available at http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/ and described in Timothy L.

Multiple motifs may be allowed, including but not limited to up to an E-value cutoff of 0.01, within the dataset to fully capture the protein-binding component of the transcriptome. The resulting motifs may be validated by a competitive pulldown assay as described below. See FIGS. 4A-4B for examples of motifs already identified by the initial RNase footprinting experiments in HeLa cells.",

In order to identify shifts/differences in protein binding sites between cell types and/or biological conditions, datasets may be compared in pair-wise analyses (e.g. cell type 1 vs. cell type 2). Specifically, to determine the RNA-protein interaction sites (PPSs) that show significant changes between cell types and/or biological conditions, negative binomial-based differential expression analyses may be applied pairwise (e.g. cell type 1 vs. cell type 2) to pseudo-read counts. These pseudo-read counts may be calculated in a manner to preserve the relative read ratios of (+) protein to (\u2212) protein samples within each cell type/biological condition.

The pseudocount vectors Cja and Cib may then be directly compared to identify cell type/biological condition-impacted RNA-protein interaction sites. In this way, the RBP-RNA interaction sites that are dynamically gained or lost between cell types and/or biological conditions may be comprehensively identified.

For example, biotinylated RNA sequences containing a candidate protein binding motif and flanking linker regions may be used to identify the proteins that bind specifically to the motif of interest. An array of negative controls may be produced where 3\u2032 biotinylated RNA probes with the same nucleotide composition as the candidate motif but with different sequences may be attached to magnetic beads (scrambled controls). The RNA-coated beads may then be equilibrated by washing twice with binding buffer (a non-limiting binding buffer example may include 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, cocktail tablet) and may be resuspended in binding buffer, for example, 500 \u03bcl of binding buffer.",

The magnetic beads may then be separated from bulk liquid with a 12 tube magnetic rack (Ambion) and the supernatant may be removed. Beads may then be washed twice, for example, with 100 \u03bcl of Wash buffer (a non-limiting example may include binding buffer containing 150 mM KCl), twice with 100 \u03bcl of elution buffer (a non-limiting example may include binding buffer with 750 mM KCl), and twice with EB\u2032 buffer (a non-limiting example may include binding buffer with 1.5M KCl). All supernatants may be collected and used for downstream analysis. To ensure that all bound proteins are removed from the RNA substrates, the RNA-coated beads may be boiled in 100 \u03bcl of gel loading buffer containing SDS (Invitrogen).

Referring to FIGS. 2A-2B, an RNase footprinting approach to identify protein-protected regions of RNA molecules in eukaryotes is illustrated. In FIG. 2A, the graph shows the classification of all moss PPSs that are identified from both ssRNase and dsRNase experiments. In FIG. 2B, the graph shows the classification of all PPSs from two human cell types (HeLa, the left bar in each panel and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), the right bar in each panel), that are identified from both ssRNase and dsRNase experiments.",
                                "The PPSs of RNAs are uncovered using a Poisson distribution-based peak finding analysis (FIGS. 2A-2B). This RNase footprinting and analysis approach is used to reliably (FDR=0.05), globally (FIG. 2), and reproducibly (Pearson correlation r=\u02dc0.80, FIG. 1C) identify PPSs in the transcriptomes of two human cell types (HeLa and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs)), and detected 340,969 and 435,283 total PPSs in HeLa and HFFs respectively (FIG. 2B). This same approach was also used to characterize RNA-protein interaction sites in the Physomitrella patens (moss, a basal plant) transcriptome, and identified 7,685 total PPSs. A statistically significant (p-value\u21920, hypergeometric test) number of these human PPSs overlapped with previously identified HuR binding sites in both HeLa and HFF cells (Lebedeva et al., 2011; Mukheree et al., 2011, which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth). Referring to FIGS. 3A-3H, examples of PPSs are illustrated with known RNA-binding protein binding sites identified by RNase footprinting (screenshots from RNase footprinting browser). W and C indicate signal from Watson and Crick strands, respectively. The screen shots also show known binding sites for HuR in SOCS4 (A), TAF 15 protein in TAF15 mRNA (B), PTB in LARP4 (C), PUM2 in PPP2CA (D), EWRS1 in CENPD (E), FUS in PCNX (F), QKI in TRRAP (G), and SRFS1 in HSP90B1 (H). Arrows designate the known RNA-binding protein sites overlapping the identified PPSs. These results indicate the RNase footprinting approaches are reliably identifying protein-bound regions of eukaryotic mRNAs.",
                                "The majority of PPSs in the human cell lines were located within human mRNAs, with introns demonstrating enrichment compared to exonic regions (FIG. 2B). Interestingly, more PPSs were localized in the 3\u2032 compared to the 5\u2032 UTR in moss as well as both human cell lines, which is consistent with the role of the 3\u2032 UTR in post-transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes (FIGS. 2A-2B). Numerous PPSs in repetitive element-derived and intergenic (unannotated) transcripts were also observed (FIGS. 2A-2B) in both organisms. The unannotated (intergenic) RNAs in both humans and plants with high levels of PPSs will be of significant interest for future study, as these are likely unannotated coding and non-coding transcripts in these transcriptome that interact with specific RBPs. It is also worth noting that PPSs were identified in other biologically important classes of RNA, including lnc- and sncRNAs (FIGS. 2A-2B). Within these classes of RNAs, TERC (the RNA subunit of telomerase) was significantly protein-bound, which was expected given that this ncRNA is known to interact with the RBP Tert. In total, the data produced by our RNase footprinting approach provides a global view of RNA-protein interactions within the human transcriptome.",
                                "Based on these preliminary results and our previous studies (Li et al., 2012, Zheng et al., 2010, which are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth), these approaches can be used to determine protein-protected regions of RNAs.",
                                "Finally, to identify over-represented motifs within the protein-protected RNA regions, the PPSs found specifically in the 5\u2032 UTR, protein-coding region, and 3\u2032 UTR were used as datasets to perform a motif search using MEME (http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/). This analysis identified >100 motifs within these specific transcript regions, many of which have been previously identified as RBP interacting sequences.",
                                "Referring to FIGS. 4A-4B, over-represented sequence motifs identified by MEME analysis of PPS sequences from the 3\u2032 UTR of transcripts from HeLa cells are shown. Examples of over-represented motifs, both novel and highly similar to known RBP-binding motifs (e.g \u03b1CP2 is known to bind a C-rich sequence) identified using PPSs from the 3\u2032 UTRs of HeLa transcripts are in FIG. 4A. Sequences illustrated in FIG. 4A are reproduced in Table 1, below. RNase-assisted RNA-affinity chromatography using the motif from FIG. 4A identified by MEME-based analysis of PPS sequences from the 3\u2032 UTR of transcripts from HeLa cells uncovers specific RNA-binding proteins interacting with each sequence motif. These results demonstrate that we are identifying bona fide RNA-binding protein interacting sequences, a number of which have not been previously uncovered.",
                                "A number of novel protein interacting sites that are highly prevalent in human mRNAs were uncovered, a number of which are depicted in FIG. 4A and shown by asterisk in Table 1. Overall, the RNase footprinting approach identifies known and novel RNA-binding protein interaction sites in human mRNAs (FIGS. 3A-3H and 4A-4B), and can be used as a new approach for identifying previously uncharacterized RBPs in any eukaryotic organism of interest."
