                        "Widespread antibiotic resistance is currently posing a grave health burden through a multitude of serious infections.2 The rise in bacterial adaptation can be directly correlated to the paucity of novel classes of antimicrobial agents.3 In the past few decades, synthetic tailoring has been the primary strategy for enhancing established core scaffolds through analog generation. Although this approach has been fruitful, no major classes of new antibiotics were introduced between 1962 and 2000.4 Therefore, to restore robust access to effective therapeutic agents, it is imperative that we engage in aggressive efforts to discover novel chemical entities with unique microbial targets.3,5",
                        "Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major nosocomial opportunistic pathogen that can spread epidemically among patients causing ventilator associated pneumonia and bacteremia, with mortality rates as high as 60%.6 Numerous reports have also shown startling emergence of multidrug resistant A. baumannii in hospitals, and also identification of pandrug resistance strains at some locations.1, 6 A. baumanni strains possess both intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and a facile ability to acquire genes encoding resistance determinants. In addition, antibiotic resistance of this pathogenic microbe appears to be mediated by their facile ability to form biofilms with a highly structured extracellular polymeric matrix, and includes the ability to colonize medical devices.7 When attached, bacterial cells that comprise the biofilm possess 10-1000 fold lower susceptibility towards antimicrobial agents compared to planktonic forms.8 Although biofilm control by drug targeting has become a high priority objective,7,8 marine microbes as a source of novel chemical entities remain underexplored."

In addition, shown herein is that the cahuitamycins are derived from two independent starter unit pathways, one of which is genetically unlinked to the core cluster. The bifurcated pathway allowed for directed pathway engineering to generate a new synthetic compound that was a potent molecule, selectively. Furthermore, mutasynthetic efforts on the ribosomally modulated strain generated two additional novel compounds with enhanced antibiotic activity.",
                        "In an effort to discover new antibiotics, a marine microbial-derived NPE library was screened to identify biofilm inhibitors in A. baumannii. Natural products accounts for the majority of currently marketed drugs,10 and the marine environment represents a potential new source of unique chemical entities.11 A crystal violet based high throughput assay was used to query against a library of 9,831 marine microbial derived NPEs in order to identify the extracts inhibiting biofilm formation as primary screen. The active extracts obtained in primary high-throughput screening were further prioritized by setting the inhibition threshold to 50% followed by a dose response assay, yielding 31 active NPEs. A second round of microbial biological activity analysis was conducted on the top nine most potent extracts. This study revealed Streptomyces gandocaensis to be of particular interest due to its ability to inhibit biofilm formation, but showing a limited effect on A. baumannii growth.",
                        "Due to the decreasing and then complete loss of production of the active biofilm inhibitor molecules from wild type S. gandocaensis, a ribosome engineering approach was employed to stabilize and improve production of the active metabolite. The approach has been employed for activation of secondary metabolite production in Streptomyces sp.,12 and can result in enhanced yields by inducing point mutation in ribosomal protein-encoding genes (e.g. rpsL). Several rounds of mutagenesis based on a streptomycin resistance phenotype resulted in restored production and an improved strain DHS287 of S. gandocaensis, that generates several-fold increased quantities of active molecules compared to initial wild type levels. Genetic analysis of the mutated strain revealed that the streptomycin-induced ribosome engineering introduced a point mutation in the rpsL gene, which encodes the ribosomal protein S12, in the engineered strain (FIGS. 1A and 1B).",
                        "Previous studies have shown that mutations in the S12 gene renders cells potentially more active for polypeptide synthesis under typical starvation conditions during the late growth phase.12 This effort appears to be the first reported instance where complete loss of an active, but structurally uncharacterized natural product has been recovered using the ribosomal engineering approach."

The 1D (1H, 13C) and 2D (gHSQCAD, gHMBCAD, gCOSY) NMR data acquired in CD3OD+D2O (4:1) indicated the peptidic nature of 1 by the presence of 8 methyl/methine carbons, 10 methylene carbons, and 9 carbonyls/quaternary carbons. Analysis of gCOSY, TOCSY and gHMBC cross peaks at \u03b4H 7.01, 7.48, 6.97 and 7.71 to \u03b4C 159.7 and 159.8 suggested the spin system consisting of an ortho-substituted phenol group. In addition, correlations observed through long range 1H-13C between \u03b4H 4.69 (H-20a) and \u03b4C 168.6 (C-21) as well as 1H-1H between \u03b4H 5.11 (H-19) and 4.61 (H-20b) interactions indicated the moiety to be a N-terminal 2-hydroxybenzoyl-oxazoline group. Further analysis of the gCOSY and TOCSY spectra indicated at least four more spin systems consisting of a serine (Ser), two modified ornithines (Orns) and a modified alanine (Ala). The modified Orn was defined as N\u03b4-hydroxy-N\u03b4-formylornithine (N\u2014OH\u2014N-fOrn) based on the COSY relay observed between \u03b4H 4.29 (H-10), 1.82(H-11), 1.68(H-12), 3.45(H-13) and a gHMBC correlation between H-13 and C-14 (\u03b4C 164.1). Similarly, another Orn-like spin system potentially related to a piperazic acid (Pip) based on long range 1H-13C between \u03b4H 3.57, 3.63 (H-8)-\u03b4C 173.9 (C-9), and a short-range 1H-1H array observed from H-5 to H-8. The C-terminal of the peptide was identified as \u03b2-alanine (\u03b2-Ala) based on COSY correlation between H-3 (\u03b4H 3.47, 3.39) to H-2 (\u03b4H 2.39) and an HMBC correlation from H-3 to C-1 (\u03b4C 174.1).

Moreover, the 1D NMR data although acquired in DMSO-d6, showed high structural similarity to 1 with the existence of six carbonyls (between \u03b4C 164.8-171.1), an aldehyde (\u03b4C 161.6, \u03b4H 8.21) and a phenyl group functionality (between \u03b4C 116.7-156.9 and \u03b4H 6.81-7.91) fulfilling 11 out of 12 degree of unsaturation. Analysis of the 2D NMR data for 2 suggested a similar carbon backbone as 1 except the gCOSY and HMBC cross peaks at \u03b4C 55.4, \u03b4H 4.56 (C-16)-\u03b4C 61.5, \u03b4H 3.58, 3.63 (C-17) and \u03b4C 55.2, \u03b4H 4.52 (C-19)-\u03b4C 61.7, \u03b4H 3.69, 3.73 (C-20) indicating two Ser groups, replacing the ring in 1, respectively. Furthermore, similar COSY and HMBC correlation as observed in 1 suggested the presence of Pip, thus accounting for the 12th degree of unsaturation to complete the structure of 2.",

The HRESIMS [M+H]+ ion peak at m/z 650.2804 provided a molecular formula of C28H39N7O11 with 13 degree of unsaturation. Extensive 1D and 2D NMR analysis indicated that 3 shares structural similarity on much of the carbon backbone compared to 2. The only observed difference was localized to the phenyl ring system where an HMBC correlation from \u03b4H 2.51 (H-24) singlet to \u03b4C 123.1 (C-25) and 112.8 (C-22) suggested methylation of the N-terminal 2-hydroxybenzoyl-oxazoline group at C-23 (\u03b4C 141.2). Furthermore, a change in 1H multiplicity at \u03b4H 6.73 (H-25) to a doublet confirmed the planar structure of 3."

                                "Cahuitamycins were observed to have siderophore like properties, and competition titrations with EDTA were conducted to identify their relative iron-binding affnities.15 In this method, the Fe-cahuitamycin complex were incubated with varying concentrations of EDTA and detected for Fe distribution using UV-vis spectroscopy. The pFeIII for cahuitamycins were calculated against the known stability constants for EDTA (pFeIII=23.42).16 Three individual titrations were conducted for each natural product, and the representative pFeIII values for cahuitamyicns 1-3 were measured to be 18.34\u00b10.16, 20.42\u00b10.09 and 17.52\u00b10.12, respectively. Interestingly, the observed iron affinities were inversely proportional to the A. baumannii biofilm inhibition ability (FIG. 3). This supports a hypothesis that the molecules display diminishing activity over an extended bioassay time course due to iron chelation.",

                                "In order to mine a candidate gene cluster for cahuitamycin biosynthesis, analysis of the draft genome sequence of S. gandocaensis was performed using antiSMASH.17 As a result, one candidate gene cluster responsible for nonribosomal peptide scaffold biosynthesis, transport, and regulation of cahuitamycins A and B (1 and 2) were identified (FIG. 2A). Cahuitamycin C (3) biosynthesis was initially expected to involve SAM-dependent C-methyltransferase through post-tailoring modification. However, the absence of genes responsible for the formation of a methyl group at C23 position of 3 near cluster 1 led to the hypothesis that perhaps another standalone gene cluster 6-methyl salicyclate synthase (6-MSAS) might be involved in the biosynthesis of 3 (FIG. 2). The architecture and annotation of the bifurcated cahuitamycin (cah) gene cluster is shown in FIG. 2 and Table 1, respectively. The cluster containing NRPS encoding genes cahA-B-C-D, together with genes involved in chain initiation (cahI-J), termination (cahG), and transcriptional regulation (cahR) is located in a region spanning about 40 kb of DNA. Each NRPS protein consists of the essential condensation (C), adenylation (A), and thiolation protein (T) domains (FIG. 2B), and has a non-co-linear architecture.",
                                "CahA is proposed to catalyze oxazoline ring formation together with a putative salicylate synthase CahI and salicylate-AMP ligase CahJ (FIG. 2B). CahI is homologous to MbtI of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is predicted to convert chorismate to salicylate (FIG. 2B).19 CahJ bears high similarity to a salicylate-AMP ligase MxcE from Sorangium cellulosum So ce56,20 which suggests that it activates the salicylate by adenylation (FIG. 2B). The identity of amino acid building blocks activated by the Cah NRPS were analyzed by examining the specificity-conferring residues in each A domain (Table 2)21. The A domain in CahA is predicted to recognize L-Cys (Table 2), though only L-Ser is loaded according to the structure of cahuitamycins, which is also observed in the amychelin biosynthetic system.18 The heterocyclization between Ser and the carbonyl group to form an oxazoline ring scaffold can be attributed to the Cy domain in CahA, and the resulting peptide product is then transferred to CahB for synthesis of 1 and 3. Similar to gobichelins formation, where oxazoline ring of gobichelin A is hydrolyzed into a linear form under non-acidic condition, 1 may convert to 2 with a free Ser through hydrolysis of the oxazoline ring.22 The in silico analysis of A domains in CahB predicts activation of L-Ser and L-N\u2014OH\u2014N-fOrn by CahB-A1 and CahB-A2, respectively (Table 2). Subsequent to the incorporation of L-Ser by CahB-A1, a L-N\u2014OH\u2014N-fOrn moiety, which is synthesized from L-Orn by a putative Orn hydroxylase (CahMO) and a putative formyltransferase (CahFT), is appended to the growing chain (Table 1). The L-N\u2014OH\u2014N-fOrn moiety linked to the T domain of CahB module 3 undergoes epimerization by the epimerase (E) domain,23,24 which is consistent with the stereochemistry of cahuitamycins.",
                                "Biosynthesis of cahuitamycins involves formation and loading of the piperazic acid (Pip) building block into the growing peptide chain. Although, the relatively rare Pip moiety is found in several biologically active secondary metabolites,25-30 the precise biosynthetic events for Pip elaboration has not been elucidated. Recent feeding experiments have suggested that generation of Pip moiety in kutzneride occurs prior to incorporation into the respective peptide chain,26 similar to the formation of a hydrazo linkage in valanimycin.25 It is likely that the biosynthesis of the piperazate moiety in cahuitamycin is initiated by N-hydroxylation of the amino group of Orn by a putative CahMO. The resulting L-N\u2014OH-Orn residue attached to the T domain of CahC is converted to its corresponding D-stereoisomer (D-N\u2014OH-Orn) by the E domain within the same module followed by nucleophilic attack of the amino group to close the ring. Alternatively, since the A domain in the CahC is homologous to L-glutamine (Gln) activating A domains (Table 2), it is possible that Gln may be incorporated as a branch point from primary metabolism into the piperazate biosynthetic pathway (FIG. 2).31,32",
                                "Further in silico analysis of the A domain in CahD (Table 2) predicted loading of \u03b2-Ala onto the T domain consistent with the structure of cahuitamycins. Also, it further affirms that the presence of \u03b2-Ala residue is likely formed from L-aspartate (L-Asp) by the cahF gene product.33 The CahD contains neither C-terminal thioesterase nor a reductase domain usually required for chain release in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis, and likely involves a specific hydrolase for the release of fully assembled peptide chain from the T domain of the last module CahD. Following final extension by \u03b2-Ala, CahG (\u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase superfamily) catalyzes in trans release of the peptide chain through hydrolysis of the T domain-bound thioester as described previously in coelichelin biosynthesis.34",
                                "Moreover, CahE, an MbtH-like protein homolog, likely contributes to the stimulation of A domains in Cah NRPS as described previously.35 CahH, which belongs to the major facilitator superfamily, is similar to EntS, an entrobactin efflux exporter of E. coli. Proteins coded by CahT1 through CahT8 are putatively required for iron uptake and translocation of cahuitamycin produced across the membrane (Table 1). Therefore, these proteins might be involved in export of cahuitamycins from the cytoplasm into the medium. ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3, show sequence similarity to oxidoreductase, acyl-transferase, and 6-aminohexanoate-oligomer hydrolase, respectively, and their relationship to cahuitamycin biosynthesis is unclear (Table 1)."

                                "The function of the assigned biosynthetic cluster was confirmed by deletion of cahI in S. gandocaensis through insertion of kanamycin resistance gene (aph). Surprisingly, the \u0394cahI S. gandocaensis DHS334 led to the selective production of 3, while the production of 1 and 2 were completely abolished. This result confirmed that the 6-methylsalicylate starter unit is derived directly from the 6-methylsalicylate synthase (6-MSAS), which is then adenylated by CahJ and loaded onto the T1 domain of CahA for production of 3. A BLAST search using bacterial 6-MSASs including various putative candidates from microbes,18,36-38 led to the identification of an unlinked iterative type I PKS gene encoding a 6-MSAS that is located at about 50 kb away from the cluster 1 based on the draft sequencing data (FIG. 2).39-40Like other bacterial 6-MSAS, cahuitamycin 6-MSAS (Cluster 2; CahMSAS) possesses keto synthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), dehydratase (DH), ketoreductase (KR), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) on a single protein (Table 1). Feeding exogenous 6-methylsalicylic acid into the culture of \u0394cahI strain resulted in an increased production of 3, while no changes were observed in production of 1 and 2. Furthermore, production of 1 and 2 was restored by external supplementation of salicylic acid to the \u0394cahI growth medium, representing chemical complementation and confirmation of its role in the production of cahuitamycins. These studies substantiate that the biosynthesis of 3 is independent of cahI-mediated salicylic acid biosynthesis and more importantly cahutamycins are derived from a bifurcated biosynthetic pathway (FIG. 2). The observation provides an intriguing example where S. gandocaensis is diversifying its biosynthetic machinery to produce a more potent/toxic molecule to provide a competitive advantage in its natural habitat."

In this approach, the DHS334 \u0394cahI strain was provided with a series of substituted benzoic acid substrates (2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2-fluorobenzoic acid, 2-hydoxy-5-methylbenzoic acid (5-methylsalicylic acid), 2-hydoxy-6-methylbenzoic acid (6-methylsalicylic acid, 2-cholorbenzoic acid) and sequentially assessed their incorporation to generate new analogs. Of the series of unnatural starter units tested, incorporation of methyl-hydroxy benzoic acid substrates showed some level of incorporation. Incorporation of 5-methylsalicylic acid into the \u0394cahI pathway provided a new analog cahuitamycin D (4).",

Extensive 1D and 2D NMR data was acquired for 4, which indicated the expected structural similarity with 3, as per the mutasynthesis hypothesis. The structure showed a similar carbon backbone with a clear difference at the phenyl ring system compared to 3. Cahuitamycin D (4) shows the presence of a singlet at \u03b4H 7.78 (H-23) with HMBC correlation to \u03b4C 20.3 (C-25) and \u03b4C 129.4 (C-24), suggesting methylation at C-24 consistent with the hypothesized incorporation of 5-methyl salicylic acid to the mutant strain DHS334 of S. gandocaensis.",

Further, 1D and 2D NMR analysis indicated that the new molecule cahuitamycin E (5) share structural similarity on much of the carbon backbone compared to 4. The only plausible difference could be traced at C-5 position where Pip moiety in 4 was substituted with L-N\u2014OH-Orn in 5, suggested based on the COSY relay observed from \u03b4H 4.33 (H-5) to \u03b4H 3.45 (H-8) along with absence of any significant HMBC correlation from H-8 to C-9 (\u03b4C 172.2).

The result from this assay showed that 1 was able to inhibit while 2 had no effects on bacterial growth or biofilm formation (FIG. 3). Interestingly, 3 possessed the highest potency with IC50 values of 14.5 \u03bcM and having a limited effect on growth of A. baumannii as desired from a suitable biofilm inhibitor drug candidate (FIG. 3). In addition, when 1 (the most abundant molecule) was tested in iron-complexed form it showed almost no impact on either growth or biofilm formation (FIG. 3). The observation when compared with a known siderophore desferroxamine demonstrated that the siderophore property of the molecule does not impart activity to the cahuitamycins. However, loss of inhibition of biofilm over time can be directly attributed to the metal-complexed cahuitamycins.",
                                "Next, the specific stage of inhibition during biofilm formation was probed as well as the extent of inhibition through a flow cell assay. This analysis revealed almost the same number of cells attached to the surface after 1 h of treatment with the bacterial solution. After 6 h of inhibitor supplementation, the flow cells treated with 1 showed only a few micro colonies while the control (no treatment) and desferoxamine showed formation of a robust biofilm. After 24 h of supplementation, the control and desferoxamine biofilm became thicker with the flow cells exposed to 1 showing larger micro colonies and initiation of biofilm formation. In addition, confocal microscope imaging analysis of the A. baumanii biofilm was conducted. In this assay, the biofilm was developed on a glass plate and left untreated as a control or treated with only 240 nM of 1 and 3. After treatment with STYO\u00ae 9 stain and propidium iodide (PI) the biofilm structure was observed. The images obtained showed a much thinner biofilm and also significantly less total biomass for the glass plates treated with 1 and 3 compared with the control. Furthermore, the glass plate treated with 3 showed a much lower level of total biomass compared to 1 at the same concentration (0.10 \u03bcm3 versus 0.18 \u03bcm3), confirming 3 to be more potent as a biofilm inhibitor.",

The new molecules were then subjected to static biofilm assay and the result demonstrated that 4 displayed almost twice the potency (IC50=8.4 \u03bcM) compared to 3, which we earlier considered to be the most active molecule (FIG. 4). Furthermore, cahuitamycin E (5) also displayed significant activity with an IC50 of 10.5 \u03bcM (FIG. 4).

                                "The emergence of A. baumannii as a dangerous nocosomial pathogen has motivated the development of new therapeutic agents to combat its ability to persist in hospitals and the environment. Provided herein is a novel structural class of biofilm inhibitors derived from a marine microbial NPE library. Cahuitamycins A-E inhibit the biofilm formation ability of A. baumannii that has been known to be involved in the emergence of an antibiotic resistance phenotype.1,39-41 The cahuitamycins are capable of binding FeIII but interestingly its apo form shows the highest level of inhibitory activity.",

The inherently flexible starter unit adenylating enzyme CahI was exploited to produce two additional analogs through incorporation in the engineered \u0394cahI strain DHS334. The new cahuitamycin analog D is twice as active as Cahuitamycin C as a biofilm inhibitor. These results establish a unique opportunity for developing and discovering new antibiotics from genetically engineered strains bearing inherent flexibility in pathway initiation processes. More importantly, given the simultaneous decline in antibiotic drug discovery and increase of multidrug resistant bacteria, the cahuitamycins may represent a propitious starting-point for discovery and development of new therapeutics against significant human pathogens.",

A knock-out plasmid based on pKC1139 (containing the apramycin resistance gene aac(3)IV) was constructed by amplifying the kanamycin resistance gene (aphII) as a selection marker from plasmid pYJ276, and left- and right-flanking regions of the cahI gene using the genomic DNA of S. gandocaensis as a template with KOD xtreme polymerase (Novagen). The primer pairs SR144-SR145, SR146-SR147, and SR148-SR149 (Table 3) were designed for amplification of the left-flanking fragment of the cahI gene, the right-flanking fragment of the cahI gene and the selection marker, respectively. DNA assembly was performed using the Gibson assembly master mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the amplified PCR products of the DNA region containing the kanamycin resistance gene and the DNA fragments containing the two flanking regions of the cahI gene, the pKC1139 vector linearized by EcoRI and HindIII digestion, and the Gibson assembly master mix were incubated at 50\u00b0 C. for 2 hr.

Briefly, purified Fe-cahuitamycins, prepared as described above, was dissolved in Hepes buffer (10 mM Hepes, 0.1 M KCl, pH 7.4) and five different concentration ranges of ETDA were added from EDTA stock solutions also prepared in HEPES buffer. Each reaction consisted of a total volume of 0.25 mL, a final concentration of 0.1 mM Fe-cahuitamycins and a range of 5-fold-8000-fold EDTA (relative to Fe-cahuitamycins) in Hepes buffer. The reaction was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for at least 24 h, and UV-visible spectra were subsequently recorded. The composite spectra contain contributions from both Fe-EDTA and Fe-cahuitamycins. The \u03b5 of both species as a function of \u03bb, were determined in Hepes buffer and used to deconvolute the spectra. The contribution of Fe-cahuitamycins was subtracted from the composite spectra using the 435 nm absorption band and the \u03b5 of both Fe-cahuitamycins and Fe-EDTA were used to quantify the proportion of each species in solution. Concentrations of apo-EDTA and apo-cahuitamycins were calculated by subtracting [Fe-EDTA] (or [Fe-cahuitamycins]) from total initial EDTA (or Fe cahuitamycins). The log [EDTA]/[cahuitamycins] was plotted against log [Fe-EDTA]/[Fe-cahuitamycins] and the data were fit to the following equation, which has been derived by Abergel et al., J. Am. Chem.
