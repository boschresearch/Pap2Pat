                        "In recent years, radio frequency identification (RFID) has been examined in various healthcare contexts. For example, implanting RFID microchips in animals and humans allows for positive identification of specific individuals. An additional interesting medical application of RFID includes incorporation into oral medication known as a \u201cdigital pill\u201d with the aim of improving patients' adherence in chronic conditions. Diverse applications of RFID have the potential to provide innovative solutions to various biomedical challenges. There remains a need for advancements in tracking in vitro and in vivo processes, in drug discovery, and in understanding disease mechanisms. Realistic RFID applications in tissue culture context, however, necessitates viable methods to incorporate the microchip into biological tissue without impairing the tissue's native structure and functions. No studies to date have examined RFID applications in tissue culture contexts, presumably due to a lack of viable methods to incorporate the microchip into biological tissue without impairing the tissue's native structure and functions. The instant disclosure seeks to address one or more of the aforementioned needs in the art."

                                "RFID is cost-effective technology for addressing personal identification, traceability and environmental considerations especially in transportation industries, which has permeated all facets of modern life1-3. RFID tags, operating wirelessly, collect energy from a nearby reader's interrogating radio waves. Its high-degree of tolerance to tested solutions, solvents, extreme temperatures, and high or low-pressure conditions4, provides the RFID tags with significant advantages over barcodes. The tags are now integrated into cards, clothing, and possessions, as well as implanted into animals and humans. For example, RFID tags are incorporated into cards and are used to pay for mass transit fares on buses, trains, subways, and to collect tolls on highways in many countries. In 2017, the world RFID market which includes tags, readers, software/services for RFID cards, labels, fobs, and all other form factors was worth US $11.2 billion in 2017 and has an estimated 10% annual growth, resulting in an anticipated value of USS $18.68 billion by 20265.",
                                "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in extending usage of RFID to the healthcare arena. For example, implanting RFID microchips in animals and humans allows for positive identification of specific individuals. Medical application of RFID now includes an oral \u201cdigital pill\u201d for chronic conditions, in efforts to improve patients' adherence6,7. The ingested radiofrequency emitter, once activated by gastric pH, emits a radiofrequency signal which is captured by a relay Hub and transmitted to a smartphone, where it provides ingestion data and deliver interventions in real time. Thus, the diverse applications of RFID provide innovative solutions to various biomedical challenges. Similarly, RFID incorporation into cells or tissues can provide advancements in tracking in vitro and in vivo processes, in drug discovery, and in understanding disease mechanisms. Recent application of micro RFID showed the passive intra-cellular delivery and short-term persistence; however, the use of mouse phagocytic cell line limits its broader application8. Thus, realistic RFID applications in tissue culture context necessitates viable methods to incorporate the microchip into biological tissue without impairing the tissue's native structure and functions.",
                                "Recently, human organoids have received international attention as an in vitro culture system where human stem cells self-organize into three-dimensional (3D) structures reminiscent of human organs9-11. Organoids, due to their higher phenotypic fidelity to human disease12, are expected to provide a mechanistic assay platform with future potential for drug screening and personalized medicine. It becomes feasible to study human pathological variations by comparing genotypes with phenotype spectrum diseases that includes cystic fibrosis13, steatohepatitis (Ouchi et al., In Revision) and cholestatic disease (Shinozawa et al., In Revision) using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) or adult stem cell library. One key feature of organoids is the development of a polarized structure surrounded by basement membrane through a self-assembly process, resulting in a cavitated structure from an aggregated tissue.",
                                "Disclosed herein are methods for self-assembly mediated incorporation of ultracompact Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips into organoids formed from human pluripotent stem cells. RFID microchip incorporated organoids (\u201cRiO\u201d) emit unique digital signals through the wireless readers, which can be used to decode donor information and localize RiO in vitro. RiO can be stored by freezing, possess their original structure and function, and maintained in long term culture. By taking advantage of donor identifiable organoids, digitalized RiO pools from different donors can be used to conduct a phenotypic screen, followed by detection of specific donors. For example, proof-of-principle experiments successfully identified that the severely steatotic phenotype is caused by a genetic disorder of steatohepatitis. The disclosed methods and compositions allow for a \u2018forward cellomics\u2019 approach as a potential strategy to determine the personalized phenotypes in a pooled condition, which is a scalable approach of studying genetic impacts on phenotype as an analogical strategy to forward genetics. Given that the miniaturization of digital devices including biosensors, robotics and cameras is rapidly evolving, bio-integration of microchip is likely to be a powerful approach to expand organoid based medical applications towards drug development, precision medicine, and transplantation. The disclosed methods and compositions may have a wide audience in the fields of bioengineering, biotechnology, material science, computational biology, stem cell biology, regenerative biology, tissue engineering, transplantation, ethics and regulatory science, providing a strategic framework to promote organoid potential for testing human variations.",

                                "Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a cost-effective and durable method to trace and track individual objects in multiple contexts by wirelessly providing digital signals, and is widely used in manufacturing, logistics, retail markets, transportation, and most recently human implants. Here, Applicant has successfully applied the digitalization principles to biological tissues by developing an ultra-compact RFID chip incorporated organoid (RiO). Demonstrated herein is a 0.4 mm RFID chip integrated inside the self-assembling organoids from 10 different induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from healthy and diseased donors. Applicant was able to decode RiO's specific donors and localize RiO in vitro by a wireless reader/writer. RiOs can be maintained for a minimum of 20 days in culture, can be frozen/thawed through a standard preservation method, and exhibit essential hepatic functions similar to control human liver organoids. Furthermore, Applicant demonstrated that the digitalized RiO from different donors could be used to conduct a phenotypic screen on a pool of RiO, followed by detection of each specific donor in situ. Applicant's proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated that the severely steatotic phenotype could be identified by RFID chip reading and was specific to a genetic disorder of steatohepatitis. Given evolving advancements surrounding RFID technology including miniaturization, environmental sensing, and data-writing capabilities, the digitalization principle outlined here will greatly expand the organoid medicine potential towards drug development, precision medicine and transplant applications.",
                                "Applicant hypothesized that aggregation-mediated self-assembling process would enable the successful internalization of miniature chips into biological tissues without compromising the native functions of the tissues. Ultracompact RFID-chips were integrated into re-aggregated iPSC-derived endoderm spheroids prior to self-assembly. Recent advancements in miniaturization have generated ultra-compact RFID microchips ranging in size from 10 \u03bcm to 600 \u03bcm7,8,14. For simplicity and accessibility, commercially available organoid-scale RFID chips were used, herein defined as an \u201cO-Chip.\u201d FIG. 1A depicts an overall strategy. Each O-Chip is 460\u00d7480 \u03bcm, and has a 512-bit memory area (FIG. 1B). By applying a specific wavelength into a coiled antenna, each O-Chip receives data sent from the reader/writer, and with energy driven by this electric current the O-Chip wirelessly sends information stored in its memory. O-Chip operates wirelessly from readers across distances of up to about 1-2 mm.",
                                "To test O-Chip integration into biological tissues, protocols were modified for generating human liver organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (Shinozawa et al, In Revision). Specifically, human iPSC were initially differentiated into posterior foregut organoids by sequential Activin and FGF4/CHIR exposure. At day 6, foregut organoids were dissociated and seeded into 96 well plates, followed by O-Chip plating. Once re-aggregated tissues were formed, tissues were treated with a 2% laminin-rich basement membrane matrix to induce self-assembly or polarization. After 3 days in culture RiO (FIG. 1C, 1D) covered by hepatic epithelial cells were successfully generated (FIG. 2A). Applicant confirmed reproducible RiO generation by using eight different donor-derived iPSC lines (FIG. 4, FIGS. 5A and 5B). The RiO formation efficiency, which means incorporation of RFID into the organoid, was very high and was 95% or more (92 of 96 organogens succeeded). Collectively, O-Chip can be efficiently integrated inside iPSC-derived organoids.",
                                "To compare the RiO with standard liver organoids (Control LO), a comparison of their morphology was first performed, and no morphological abnormalities in RiO were observed compared with Control LO (FIG. 2A). Next, Applicant performed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis to detect liver specific genes (FIG. 2B). qPCR analysis revealed that RiO expressed equivalent levels of albumin (ALB), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) compared to Control LO (FIG. 2B). To confirm these findings, Applicant performed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of culture supernatant for the liver specific protein ALB, and found comparable protein levels between the RiO and Control LO (FIG. 2C). Applicant found that the RiO secreted ALB at levels of 152.9 ng/ml after 24 hr, which is very similar to Control LO (1.02-fold) (FIG. 2C) Immunofluorescent whole mount staining confirmed the presence of ALB+ cells inside the RiO (FIG. 2D). Another liver marker, HNF4a, was found in the nucleus of ALB+ cells (FIG. 2D and FIG. 6C).",
                                "To further investigate the functional capacity of RiO, Applicant analyzed bile transport potential. The bile transport capacity of RiO was studied using the fluorescent bile acids cholyl-lysyl-fluorescein (CLF) and rhodamine 123, which are the substrates for the Bile Salt Efflux Pump (BSEP) and the cholangiocyte surface glycoprotein multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1), respectively. Applicant has previously shown that Control LO have the capacity to uptake CLF and rhodamine123 inside the organoids through BSEP and MDR1. Consistent with this, CLF and rhodamine123 were absorbed into the cells of RiO within minutes of the addition of the fluorescent bile acids. The fluorescent acids were then excreted and accumulated in the lumen of RiO (FIG. 2E). The fat accumulation capacity of RiO was studied using the fatty acid treatment and lipid dye BODIPY 493/503 for lipids. We treated the RiO with fatty acids and then visualized the amount of lipid accumulation in the RiO using BODIPY (FIG. 6). For quantification, Applicant used ImageJ LUT to convert the BODIPY\u00ae intensity in each image from brightness and darkness levels to a numerical value. In addition, Applicant also analyzed iron accumulation in RiO (FIG. S7). It was studied using the ammonium iron sulfate (FAS) treatment and Fe dye FeRhoNox 540/575. Thus, RiO possess multiple human hepatic functions similar to control LO including ALB (albumin) secretion and bile transport function, suggesting the presence of the RFID chip in the liver organoids does not seem to affect native structure and function.",
                                "RFID chips are generally highly durable, but their durability in multiple tissue culture contexts has not been examined. To determine their cryopreservation potential under ultralow temperatures, Applicant examined the tolerance of O-Chip to freezing or to submersion in liquid nitrogen. For slow freezing and vitrification, O-Chip may be subjected to low temperatures during storage. A range of temperatures was tested, from 4\u00b0 C. to \u2212196\u00b0 C., to determine tolerance and whether efficacy was impacted (Table.1). In addition, during culture conditions the incorporated O-Chip must also endure dynamic changes in pH. Throughout exposures to these conditions, the RFID tags remained intact and durable, suggesting a high degree of tolerance to low temperatures and pH (Table.1). Moreover, 0-Chip remained functional after routine laboratory sterilization processes such as autoclaving (dry and heat methods). The O-Chip incorporated in paraffin embedded RiO could still be detected wirelessly. Since paraffin embedded process required immersion of O-Chip in water-based solutions and ethanol, these results supported tolerance to O-Chip to solutions and solvents (FIG. 5, FIG. 8). The wireless detection of RiO-derived signals can be possible both in in vitro and in vivo settings (FIG. 9). Collectively, O-Chips functions robustly under a variety of environmental exposures routine to tissue culture protocols.",
                                "The remarkable durability of O-Chip prompted Applicant to test their cryopreservation potential of RiO. To develop an efficient method for optimal cryopreservation of RiO, Applicant carried out comparative experiments using several different reagents and freezing methods (FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B). The morphology of RiO was fully preserved after thawing after the gradual freezing method (FIG. 7B), and the O-Chip could be read without being affected. To evaluate the potential for a phenotypic screening assay after freezing and thawing, Applicant examined the previously frozen organoids by inducing steatosis according to unpublished protocols (Ouchi et al., In Revision). The thawed RiO was exposed to free fatty acid, and BODIPY\u00ae live-cell staining was performed to detect lipid accumulation. Fluorescence microscopy imaging showed that the cryopreserved RiO had retained the capability for accumulating lipid droplets (FIG. 7D, FIG. 10D). Taken together, cryopreserved RiO not only retained its morphology, but preserved lipid storage.",
                                "Next, Applicant evaluated how readily RiO can be traced (FIG. 3). Generated RiOs were placed into 96 and 24 well plastic plates (FIG. 3A, 3B). When the excitation RF pulse was applied from the bottom, the O-Chip was detected wirelessly, and Applicant measured their frequencies by measuring Radio Strength Signal Indicator (\u201cRSSI\u201d) values. RSSI indicates the strength of RFID signals and values range from \u2212100 to 0. The closer to 0 RSSI values are, the stronger the signals are. The signals depend on factors such as distance or shielding materials. Comparisons of RSSI measurements of RiOs indicated there were no significant difference amongst the different plate configurations or media supporting the RiOs (FIG. 3C).",
                                "Applicant further used the O-Chip system to track the post-transplant location in vivo. To establish the feasibility of this approach, Applicant localized O-Chips into three different locations following subcutaneous implantation in an anesthetized mouse (FIG. 3C). After embedding the O-Chips under mouse skin (FIG. 3D), Applicant measured RSSI values with a reader directly over the mouse's skin. The RSSI of the received signals exhibited three different peaks corresponding to the target locations. A localization accuracy was less than 1,000 \u03bcm among measurements for all cases. Compared to the signal strength obtained in a microtube, RSSI of RFID microchips under mouse skin was modestly lower but still detectable (FIG. 3E). Implantation into the abdominal cavity and subcapsule of the kidney did not emit sufficient signals to the receivers and could not be measured. As such, subcutaneous locations may be preferred for optimal RiO tracing in living biological tissues.",
                                "To further identify each RiO, Applicant developed a device to simultaneously measure the fluorescence and detect the RFID chip in one step. The measurement workflow and device details for RiO phenotyping are shown in FIG. 3A. Using this detection system, simultaneous Electronic Product Code (EPC) recording and fluorescence imaging of passing RiO are possible through the flow (FIG. 3B). This device was composed of a microliter-scale syringe pump, a flow path through which the organoid passes, a detection probe that recognizes RFID, and a fluorescence microscope. To validate the entire system with RIO, Applicant treated the organoid with fatty acids and then visualized the lipid accumulation in the RiO using a lipid-specific fluorescent dye called BODIPY\u00ae. Then, RiOs were passed through the flow path using a syringe pump that can adjust the flow rate on a microscale. Subsequently, the RFID signal was detected together with a snapshot of fluorescence intensity (FIG. 3C). Thus, Applicant successfully developed a higher-throughput detection device for fluorescence imaging based on phenotyping assay coupled with the RFID-integrated organoids.",
                                "Understanding the pathological variations in human diseases with human stem cell models is considered by some to be vital to promote precision medicine and drug screening applications. Community efforts to derive a population human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) library from healthy and diseased donors provides an accessible platform to study gene expressional variation such as gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (Kilpinen et al., 2017)15. However, head-to-head manual comparison among different lines is completely inefficient and unrealistic, and, more importantly, the organoid-level phenotyping method remains to be developed. To circumvent this challenge, Applicant approached the RiO based approach so as to detect the specific donor from pools after identifying a notable phenotype through an initial screen.",
                                "As a proof-of-principle phenotypic screen, Applicant specifically generated a small pool of frozen RiOs (FIG. 4A, FIG. 4B, FIG. 11). Applicant selected seven different donor derived iPSCs that included two patients with a monogenic form of steatohepatitis, called Wolman disease. Wolman disease is caused by the absence of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), and hepatocytes from Wolman disease patients have heavy lipid accumulation, so measuring lipid accumulation of hepatocytes can provide an effective screen for steatosis. Applicant confirmed prominent steatosis progression in Wolman-derived LO after exposure to free fatty acids (FIG. 8, FIG. 12). Similarly, BODIPY\u00ae live-imaging was conducted against the pooled RiO (FIG. 4C). Fluorescent microscopy imaging confirmed significantly higher intensity in specific RiO versus others (FIG. 4D). Applicant identified each RiO donor by its RFID chip and discovered that these higher intensity RiO (indicative of increased steatosis) corresponded to Wolman disease-derived iPSC organoids (FIG. 4D). Thus, these RiO have successfully recapitulated human, genetic-based, steatohepatitis pathology by reflecting human genetic disease. More importantly, a RiO based pooling approach may be an efficient way to determine individualized phenotypes in a high throughput setting.",
                                "Net, the Applicant has identified an innovative strategy to track a spectrum of organoid phenotypes by integrating a digital miniaturized RFID into biological tissues, in particular, organoids that maintain their one or more native functions. Applicant has found that, the collective cells experience aggregation via a self-assembling cavitation process, the micro-chips seamlessly locate into the intra-lumen of organoids without compromising native structures, preventing any tissue damage or destruction. Strikingly, the chip-integrated organoids underwent freezing and thawing cycles with no obvious loss of viability, and would, therefore, greatly facilitate the banking efforts of multiple donor derived organoids. Given that the miniaturization of digital devices including biosensors16, robotics17, and cameras18 is rapidly evolvine19,20, the overall strategy exemplified with RFID will enable the development of new integral approaches for the sensing, management and intervention of biological tissues.",
                                "About 5,000+ pluripotent stem cell lines have been established and deposited into emerging biobanks such as HipSci, EBiSC, WiCell, Coriell, RIKEN and NYSCF. A recently proposed \u201ccellomics\u201d approach, in which population stem cell array is coupled to the assessment of the phenotypic variabilities of each line, is a highly attractive approach to screen and define the cellular and molecular basis for human variations, such as expression (eQTL)-based association studies (Kilpinen et al., 2017)15. However, conventional laboratory scale protocols are essentially inefficient and not equipped to perform large comparative analyses, as culturing each cell line separately is costly and labor intensive. In contrast, the current RFID market price is around US $0.1-0.2. Even considering that large numbers of stem cell or primary cell lines are used, the overall cost for analysis is by far inexpensive as compared to available cutting-edge single-cell genomics approaches for identifying individual in a pooled condition. Thus, the RFID-based strategy is a cost-effective and therefore scalable approach to enable forward donor identification",
                                "More importantly, organoid-level phenotyping, and not just transcriptomic analysis, is particularly demanding for drug screening or precision medicine applications. RiO-based phenotyping at the organoid level is a different class of approach to determine large scale phenotypes, not just a transcriptomic characterization. By taking advantage of donor identifiable organoids and expanding on existing concepts, a \u2018forward cellomics\u2019 approach may be used as a potential strategy to determine the personalized phenotypes in a pooled condition. Forward genetics is a known scalable approach of studying genetic impacts on phenotype as a counter strategy to reverse genetics, which determines the function of a gene by analyzing the phenotypic effects of altered DNA sequences. Likewise, a forward cellomics approach would first determine phenotypic variations by existing screen methods, and then study the causal genetic and cellular bases for pronounced differences. Applicant's data suggests the possibility of this \u201cforward\u201d phenotyping methods, at least, for example, for determining monogenic basis for pathological phenotype of steatohepatitis. By pooling the organoids in the same well, significant cost reduction will be expected, in addition to enhanced reproducibility of the experiments. The disclosed compositions and methods may be coupled to developing high throughput organoid phenotyping assays21, all of which could be extended to other organoid systems or diseases. Nevertheless, the presented methodology is scalable and time and cost-efficient. Digitalized organoids may be used to facilitate the in vitro study of an extensive population cohort by examining variable disease phenotypes, drug safety and efficacy.",
