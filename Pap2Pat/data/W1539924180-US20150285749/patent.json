    "abstract": "The structure of materials can be characterized (e.g., via CD-SAXS) by generating a burst of electron bunches in a pulse train and accelerating the electron bunches to relativistic energies. Meanwhile, an optical cavity is filled with a laser pulse; and the electron bunches collide with the laser pulse in the optical cavity, permitting a single laser pulse to interact with the electron bunch train to generate x-rays via inverse Compton scattering. The generated x-rays are then directed to a sample, and the sample is imaged by measuring the scattering of the x-rays from the sample.",

                        "Since their discovery in 1895, x-rays have been the single most powerful technique for determining the structure of all forms of condensed matter. Through increasingly powerful imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopic techniques, physicists, chemists, biologists, and medical doctors, as well as quality-control inspectors, airline passenger screeners, and forensic scientists have resolved the structural detail and elemental constituency on length scales from inter-atomic spacing to the size of the human body. Every day, that knowledge underpins our modern technologies, our health, and our safety. Quite remarkably, for the first 70 of these 114 years, x-ray sources changed little from the original Roentgen tube. Even today, the x-ray technology used in universities, industrial labs and hospitals is derived from this primitive electron tube with minor improvements.",
                        "Today, however, the benchmark for x-ray performance is set by large accelerator-based synchrotron radiation facilities, of which more than 60 exist worldwide. Interestingly, despite this large investment in major facilities, 15 of the 19 Nobel Prizes awarded for x-ray-based discoveries used small fixed or rotating-anode-based x-ray sources. The wide availability of modest sources, their ease of use, and their capacity to test new ideas without the barriers of schedule, travel, and expense of the major facilities have led to a remarkable array of scientific breakthroughs.",
                        "Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) x-ray sources can exploit head-on inverse Compton scattering (ICS) involving a relativistic electron and a laser photon, where the scattered photon is shifted into the hard x-ray regime. Compton-scattering x-ray sources have shown promising results at low repetition rates. However, all known previous ICS x-ray beams have been of relatively low brilliance, due to poor properties of the electron and optical beam sources."

                        "In an exemplary method, critical dimension small-angle x-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) is performed by generating a burst of electron bunches in a pulse train and accelerating the electron bunches to relativistic energies. Meanwhile, an optical cavity is filled with a laser pulse; and the electron bunches collide with the laser pulse in the optical cavity, permitting a single laser pulse to interact with the electron bunch train to generate x-rays via inverse Compton scattering. The generated x-rays are then directed to a sample, and feature sizes of the sample are obtained by measuring the scattering of the x-rays from the sample.",
                        "In various embodiments, the electron source generates 100 bunches of electrons at 1 kHz; and the apparatus includes a radiofrequency (RF) linear accelerator; a laser system with one oscillator and two amplifier chains (including a first chain of 1 pulse at 1 KHz IR for ICS interaction and a second chain of 100 pulses at 1 kHz UV for a photo cathode in the electron source); a laser cavity for recycling the laser pulse from the first chain; and an integrated x-ray optic for collecting a large spectral bandwidth and angular divergence of the x-rays produced.",
                        "The electron source can be an RF photo injector and can operate in the \u201cblowout\u201d regime for producing low-emittance (high-quality) electron bunches. Low emittance is advantageous for high x-ray output and proper interaction with the laser pulse. The electron source can also have high gradients (>100 MV/m) on the electron emission surface for producing low-emittance (high-quality) electron bunches. Special thermal considerations for achieving a 1 kHz repetition rate include a short cavity fill time, targeted placement of cooling channels, dynamic control of coolant temperature, and deformation of cavity irises.",
                        "The RF linear accelerator can operate in a standing wave mode for efficiency, and the same RF driver can be used for the electron source and accelerator for synchronization and cost savings.",
                        "The electron bunch can be focused after acceleration to a small spot (e.g., with a diameter of about 1 micron). This focal point is the interaction point between the electron bunch and the colliding laser; and this size is close to the diffraction limit of the laser spot. The electron bunch length can be \u02dc1 picoseconds (ps).",
                        "The amplifier chains for the laser can be synchronized within much less than 0.1 ps because they are driven by the same oscillator. The oscillator can be at a sub-harmonic or harmonic of the laser cavity repetition rate. The second amplifier chain can produce a \u02dc100 femtosecond (fs) ultraviolet pulse for operating in the \u201cblowout\u201d regime. The first amplifier chain can produce a 2-4 ps IR pulse. This pulse length matches well with the electron bunch length, and the pulse length matches the laser Rayleigh range at the interaction point.",
                        "The output of the first amplifier chain can be coupled into a linear cavity through a dichroic mirror, and the IR pulse can be converted to green through second harmonic generation. The cavity produces a small focal spot (several microns) that approaches the diffraction limit, which maximizes the x-ray output. This focal spot overlaps with the electron spot.",
                        "The laser cavity can be designed to operate in a 4f configuration. The laser cavity may be asymmetric; i.e., the focal length of the lens and mirror may be unequal. The configuration minimizes the accumulated B-integral\u2014B-integral leads to degradation of the laser pulse in the cavity and damage. Surface fields can be below the damage threshold of the optical components, and the laser cavity loss can be less than 1%. This allows for 100 or more interactions in the cavity between the laser pulse and the electron bunches, as each electron bunch interacts with the laser pulse from a different round trip in the cavity.",
                        "The laser cavity can be at a small angle (e.g., about 5 degrees) with respect to the electron beam, which avoids radiation damage, and avoids loss of x-ray output flux.",
                        "The x-ray beam can be collected by a Montel (or nested Kirkpatrick-Baez) optic that focuses or collimates the beam. This optic can collect a large angle of the x-rays produced (e.g., 10 mrad) and 5% of the bandwidth of x-rays produced.",
                        "The interaction region design can include the laser cavity tilted at a small angle with respect to the electron beam, a bending dipole to divert the electron beam from the x-ray beam, quadrupole focusing within centimeters of the interaction point, laser focusing within centimeters of the interaction point, and an x-ray optic placed within centimeters of the interaction point due to the tilted cavity and due to the bending of the electron beam. This proximity decreases the cost of the optic and increases its performance and allows for a diverging x-ray source.",
                        "This source can be optimized for CD-SAXS at, e.g., 17 keV for metrology of semiconductor (e.g., Si or GaAs) chips. X-ray beams produced by this source have the same broad suite of applications as large synchrotron or free electron laser facilities, including lithography, protein crystallography, ultrafast chemistry, and x-ray imaging. Due to its small size and high performance, this source has applications in hospitals, industrial labs, and universities. For example, the source can be configured as a powerful source of soft x-rays for use in electronic chip manufacturing.",
                        "The compact x-ray sources described herein can enable x-ray beam performance that approaches the performance of the mega-facilities in general; and, in critical parameters, such as pulse length and source size, the compact x-ray sources may surpass them, which may facilitate major advances, for example, in ultrafast x-ray science and diagnostic phase-contrast imaging. For ultra-fast x-ray diffraction, to understand matter far from equilibrium or to study chemical reactions in real time, compact x-ray light source technology can produce powerful pulses of x-rays having time duration well under a picosecond. New phase-contrast imaging methods, already demonstrated on large synchrotrons, may accordingly be made available in hospitals to provide a new tool in the battle against breast cancer or heart disease.",
                        "A compact hard x-ray source with properties appropriate for a critical dimension small-angle x-ray scattering (CD-SAXS) tool can be advantageously used to characterize nanometer-scale features on semiconductor structures. The inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of short electron bunches on a high-power laser can produce an x-ray flux orders of magnitude higher than existing compact sources and can produce SAXS data at a rate comparable with a major synchrotron.",
                        "The future requirements for accurate and precise measurement of the critical dimensions (CD) of advanced 3D microelectronic architecture will not be satisfied by optical methods as the technology moves below the 22 nm node. For 3D structures, such as FinFETs and high-aspect ratio (HAR) memory devices, the key process parameters, such as feature heights, sidewall angles, and oxide and nitride layer thicknesses, are readily accessible by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) methods as demonstrated in synchrotron-based studies. These studies also clearly imply that CD-SAXS will require a high-brilliance and compact x-ray technology if this diagnostic method is to be integrated into industrial fabrication lines.",
                        "Existing methods of CD-SAXS studies include characteristic x-rays from an x-ray tube using a liquid metal jet anode and large synchrotrons. X-ray tube sources, even with the enhanced performance offered by liquid metal anodes, provide 2-3 orders of magnitude less flux than the source described herein; and the radiation wavelength from x-ray tube sources is not optimal since it is fixed to certain atomic transition lines available from the liquid metal. Synchrotron facilities have higher demonstrated x-ray performance than the source described herein but cost $100 million to $1 billion and have kilometer lengths. The estimated cost of the source described herein is less than $5 million, and its size is less than 5 meters, features which make it commercially viable and suitable for installation in existing Si wafer-fabrication plants.",
                        "In addition to entirely new applications, these compact sources offer many other advantages. For example, these compact sources, may accelerate the pace of drug discovery by providing protein structure solutions immediately upon crystallization, rather than waiting precious days, weeks, or sometimes months for access to the big, remote synchrotrons. For the first time, educational institutions may have the ability to train students in these powerful emergent applications of x-rays without the often prohibitive constraints of travel and the limitations of beam time. Electronic chip manufacturing facilities can use these sources to perform in-situ metrology of today's three-dimensional nanometer sized structures. Museums and other cultural institutions can perform in-house x-ray analysis on historic works of art. Advanced major facilities, such as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, can benefit from a compact source to combine x-ray analysis with magnetic and neutron studies. Finally, the characteristics of the x-rays produced by such compact sources can be improved through research and development, increasing flux and coherence with the ultimate goal of achieving a compact x-ray source with fully coherent hard x-ray beams.",
                        "These compact sources may also open up new scientific frontiers, particularly in ultrafast dynamics and spectroscopy. Although these capabilities may not match the standard expected for fourth-generation light sources, these compact sources can provide x-ray parameters approaching those of current third-generation light sources for a fraction of the cost; and, in some parameters, such as pulse length and source size, may significantly exceed what is possible at the major facilities. In addition to the economic benefits, the flexibility of these sources can provide high brilliance x-rays in environments where they are not currently possible.",

                        "Inverse Compton scattering is the up-conversion of a low-energy laser photon to a high-energy x-ray by scattering from a relativistic electron (e.g., when the electron energy exceeds its rest energy (0.511 MeV); the velocity of the electron is then 87% of the speed of light). FIG. 1 shows the geometry of the interaction with a near head-on collision between the laser beam 12 and electron beam 14, where the total length from the cathode of the radiofrequency (RF) gun 16 through the solenoid magnets 15, through a one-meter-long linear accelerator 17, and through quadrupole magnets 19 to the inverse Compton scattering (ICS) interaction point 18 is 2.5 meters. The length of the x-ray beamline depends on the experiment but is typically 1 meter. Relatively large x-ray divergence of several mrad leads to shorter beamlines. The scattered x-rays 20 emerge from the ICS interaction point 18 in the same direction as the electrons 14. The physics of ICS are nearly identical to spontaneous synchrotron emission in a static magnetic undulator, as used at the large traditional synchrotron facilities; but, because the wavelength of the laser is much shorter than a static undulator period, the energy required of the electrons 14 to make hard x-rays 20 is orders of magnitude lower than it is in the large synchrotrons, reducing the size and cost of the compact ICS source by orders of magnitude.",
                        "The resulting x-rays can then be passed through a sample 36 and captured at a detector 38 to generate an x-ray image of the sample 36."

                                "For a scattering process, such as ICS, the highest flux is produced by creating the densest target in order to increase the probability of scattering. High density is achieved by squeezing the electron and laser beams 14 and 12 in each of their dimensions. Thus, the laser pulse 12 is short in time and is focused to a small waist. Likewise, the electron beam 14 is focused to a small spot and is of short duration to interact efficiently with the laser beam 12. The x-ray source is optimized to produce a small, radially symmetric x-ray beam 20 of a few (e.g., 2-5) microns diameter and having an opening angle of a few (e.g., 2-5) mrad. This source contrasts with a typical synchrotron beam that has a source size of 100 \u03bcm and an opening angle of perhaps 100 grad. However, because the product of source size and divergence for the ICS and synchrotron sources are similar, x-ray optics 26 can be used to collimate the ICS x-ray beam 20, producing a larger virtual source with a smaller opening angle similar to synchrotron radiation.",
                                "There are, of course, limits to improvements in x-ray output by focusing to ever smaller spots. For the electron beam 14, the emittance is the determining factor. The emittance (a conserved quantity) of an electron beam 14 at a focus is just the product of the beam size and its divergence. Making a smaller focus means that the divergence is larger; and, eventually, the spread in angles of the electron trajectories will become the dominant cause of increase for both the bandwidth and the opening angle of x-rays 20, lowering the beam brilliance. The laser beam focus size is advantageously similar to the electron beam size to maximize the interaction, but this matching sets limits on acceptable pulse lengths.",

Neglecting nonlinear effects that are weak at the milliJoule laser energy of the present study, x-ray production scales as the square of the laser intensity so it is important for the electron/laser interaction at point 18 to take place within the Rayleigh diffraction length of the laser beam 12. The Rayleigh length, ZR=\u03c0w02/\u03bbL, depends strongly on the laser waist size, w0. ZR can become much shorter than the laser pulse length for small w0, reducing the x-ray flux. The shortest laser pulse length is generally determined by the laser bandwidth, which depends on the particular laser material chosen. The laser 22 needs to be able to produce short pulses 12 with high pulse energy and high average power, limiting the selection of materials to a few candidates. The electron bunch 14 is also constrained to interact within ZR, so it must be short as well. Note that the output x-ray pulse length depends only on the electron bunch length and not the laser length in the same way that the undulator x-ray pulse length does not depend on undulator length. The quantitative effects of pulse length and focus size are shown in numerical studies, below. First, relations are derived that guide the design of the electron and laser beams and the resulting x-ray source.",

Inspecting the plot of FIG. 3, the vertical width of the intensity band represents energy bandwidth. It is apparent that the on-axis bandwidth is quite narrow (0.7% in this case due to all of the effects described above); but, as radiation is collected at larger angles, the bandwidth is substantially broadened and emitted at lower photon energy. These off-axis effects are due to the \u03b32\u03b82 term in Equation 1 creating an energy-angle correlation. The same phenomenon occurs, of course, with undulator radiation; however, the low electron energy used in ICS (one of its primary advantages) results in a larger opening angle of the radiation.

The maximum bunch charge is also limited by the available cathode-laser power and the cathode quantum efficiency (QE). The emittance requirement, \u2208xn\u22120.2 \u03bcm, is set so that the electron divergence at the micron-sized focus at the interaction point 18 is less than the radiation opening angle of 1/\u03b3. The bunch length during acceleration is advantageously limited to a few RF degrees (3\u00b0=1 ps) so that the energy spread remains small. The blowout mode of generating an ellipsoidal bunch distribution is used for its ability to generate short bunches with a uniform charge distribution that exhibits linear space charge forces (thus avoiding emittance growth). These bunches are well suited for temporal compression and show excellent focusing characteristics for producing micron-sized spots at the interaction point 18. The blowout method reduces sensitivity to laser temporal pulse shaping and inhomogeneities in the cathode emission. Furthermore, because the transverse space charge forces are not only linear, but also identical in each time slice, there is little relative rotation of the time slices in phase space so that emittance compensation schemes are less critical.",

A schematic layout of the laser system, shown in FIG. 29, consists of two amplifier chains 42 and 44 driven by the same fiber oscillator 46 to simplify synchronization. The fiber oscillator 46 operates at a repetition rate of 200 MHz, which sets the frequency for the burst of electron pulses 14. The bandwidth of the 1-nJ fiber oscillator pulse is 12 nm to counteract the effects of gain narrowing in the two amplifier chains 42 and 44. The fiber oscillator pulse is stretched to 100 ps and amplified to 10 nJ in order to provide enough pulse energy for the two amplifier chains 42 and 44. The first amplifier chain 42 is used to pump the ICS laser cavity 28. The first amplifier chain 42 selects pulses at 1 kHz and amplifies them to 2 mJ, followed by a cryogenic multi-pass Yb:YAG amplifier to reach 100 mJ with 2.8 ps pulse width. This pulse is coupled into a ringdown cavity 28 by passing it through a dichroic mirror 30 and frequency doubling to produce green light. The conversion to green light simplifies the cavity design and allows it to operate as a ringdown cavity 28 with modest synchronization requirements. The green wavelength (instead of infrared) also permits operating with a lower-energy electron beam 14 that saves on the cost of the accelerator equipment. The laser beam 12 is shown colliding at a small angle offset from head on (in FIG. 1) to allow the electron beam 14 and the x-ray beam 20 to avoid the laser optics. This cavity 28 allows for 100 interactions with a single laser pulse 12 greatly increasing the x-ray flux.",

The same laser oscillator that drives the ICS laser begins a separate laser amplifier chain 44 for the UV photocathode drive laser. The format of the UV cathode laser output 48 is a burst of 100 pulses at 253 nm each separated by 5 ns to produce a train of 100 electron bunches 14 of 100 pC charge each in the accelerator. These parameters are chosen to match the 500 ns flattop region of the high power RF pulse. Two multi-pass Yb:KYW amplifiers increase the IR pulse energy to 200 \u03bcJ for an average power of 20 W. The output is frequency doubled twice to produce the UV pulse for the photo-injector gun 16.",

The heart of this laser driver is a diode pumped cryogenic composite thin disk 50 (insert in FIG. 30) that we estimate can surpass the performance of traditional thin disks. On the cooled face of the disk 50, the laser-grade high-reflector exists in intimate contact through soldering with a cryogenically cooled heat-spreader. The opposite face of the thermally-loaded gain-sheet is diffusion bonded to an index-matched cap of undoped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG). The function of the undoped cap is to dilute fluorescence, diminishing the influence of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and dramatically enhancing energy storage of inverted Yb3+ ions. The edges are fashioned to eject fluorescence; furthermore, the much stiffer gain element affords resilience to thermo-mechanical deformations for excellent beam quality.",

The seed pulses for the amplifier chain 42 are generated from a femtosecond Yb-doped fiber laser 22 and stretched with conventional gold-ruled (Horiba) gratings. The seed is boosted to \u02dc5 nJ with an in-line Yb-doped fiber amplifier before injecting a commercial Yb:KYW regenerative amplifier that outputs 2 mJ, \u02dc1 ns pulses at repetition rates up to 1 kHz. To achieve high pulse energy, which needs high gain, we devised a strictly image-relayed multi-pass architecture; and the significant thermo-mechanical, thermo-optical and spectroscopic advantages of operating Yb:YAG at cryogenic temperature were realized. To increase bandwidth, the multi-pass amplifier operates at 130 K, bringing the pulse energy to 100 mJ before being compressed with dielectric-coated gratings.",

The round trip length of the cavity 28 (between the mirrors 30, wherein the concave mirror at right is a dichroic mirror) is 1.5 meters, which corresponds to the repetition rate of the electron bunches 14 in the burst mode. The cavity loss is on the order of 1% with HR/AR coatings contributing less than 0.2% loss per element and the single-harmonic-generation (SHG) lithium triborate (LBO) crystal 52 contributing 0.2-0.5% loss. This loss will allow for efficient interaction with all 100 of the electron bunches 14 produced in the burst mode. Also shown in the cavity 28 is a fused silica lens 54.",

The 100 mJ infrared (IR) pulse is coupled into the cavity 28 through a dichroic mirror 30. After coupling into the cavity 28, the IR pulse 12 is up-converted to 515 nm via second harmonic generation (SHG) in LBO 52. The target SHG conversion efficiency is 50%, occurring during two passes of the IR pulse 12 through the LBO 52, in order to minimize the losses and undesired non-linearities during the ring down of the cavity 28. The residual IR pulse is removed through the dichroic mirror 30 from which it was coupled into the cavity 28.",

The susceptibility of the cavity 28 to filamentation is determined by the accumulated B-integral 62, plotted in FIG. 32, which is advantageously kept below two. Due to the large B-integral 62, spatial filtering in the form of an iris at the interaction point 18 is used to remove the higher-order content produced by filamentation. Alternate materials, such as barium borate (BBO) for the SHG crystal 52 and calcium fluoride (CaF) for the lens 54 may serve to further reduce the B-integral 62.

Second, in order for the RF photoinjector 16 to operate in the blowout regime, the UV laser pulse needs to be \u02dc100 fs.",

The Yb:KYW gain medium has higher gain cross section than Yb:YAG crystal at room temperature, while having a broad emission bandwidth (e.g., 16 nm) to support sub-ps pulse amplification. The gain medium is suitable for the amplified output power of moderately high average power and low energy per pulse (mJ level) without cryogenic cooling technology. The regenerative amplifier described in the ICS laser section provides a very high gain in a single stage but it cannot amplify the pulse train as needed for a photoinjector 16. Therefore, a multi-stage multi-pass amplifier with a proper gain control is a straightforward way of obtaining a high-power burst of optical pulses 12.",

Each burst 12 contains 100 pulses totaling 20 mJ of energy, reaching 20 W of average power at 1 kHz repetition rate. The control of gain narrowing is important to maintain the final spectral bandwidth broader than 3 nm to compress the pulses to 500 fs. Our calculation shows that the seed spectral bandwidth of 12 nm with the gain of 4\u00d7104 will result in the amplified bandwidth of 4.5 nm, which supports a pulse compression to 300 fs. The compressed pulses can be frequency quadrupled into UV pulses in two BBO crystals 52 via cascaded SHG with a conversion efficiency of 10%. Finally, we can obtain a kHz UV burst containing 150 fs pulses with 20 J of energy, which is an advantageous photo-cathode source for an RF gun."

                                "An initial CD-SAXS beamline layout is shown in FIG. 34 using a nested Kirkpatrick-Baez (also known as Montel) optic 26. The diverging x-ray beam 20 is reflected from the mirrors 27 of the optic 26 and then transported to the sample 36. The mirrors 27 are two perpendicular elliptically bent slabs; the x-ray beam 20 is reflected twice, once from each mirror 27. After passing through the sample 36, the scattered x-ray beam 56 is detected by a detector 38, while the unscattered x-ray beam 58 is blocked. The full length of the system is \u02dc120 cm, depending on the resolution of the detector 38 and size of the sample 36.",
                                "The intensity of the x-ray beam 56 scattered by the sample 36 is measured as a function of the momentum transfer, Q, or the scattering angle. At small angles, Q=4\u03c0/\u03bb sin(\u03b8/2)\u22452\u03c0\u03b8/\u03bb. For critical-dimension determination, the sample 36 is a periodic structure with pitch, d, resulting in diffraction orders (Bragg peaks) at momentum transfers, Qd=2\u03c0n. The pitch can be obtained from distances between the diffraction orders, \u03b4Q=2\u03c0/d\u22450.3 nm\u22121 for pitch=22 nm (at 17 keV). Angular positions of the diffraction orders are determined by n\u03bb=2d sin (\u03b8/2)\u2245d\u03b8. From here, \u0394\u03b8=\u03bb/d\u22453 mrad. In CD-SAXS measurements at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron facility, about 20 diffraction orders were measured, corresponding to Qmax\u224520\u03b4Q\u22456 nm\u22121 and \u03b8max\u224560 mrad.",
                                "For a source-optic distance of 30 cm, the x-ray beam size at the mirrors 30 is 3 mm assuming beam divergence (FWHM) of 10 mrad. The sample 36 is placed between the optics 26 and the detector 38, where the cross-section of the x-ray beam 20 is the size of the sectional area of the sample 36 (e.g., about 80 \u03bcm). For magnification, M=3, the optic-detector distance is 90 cm; thus, samples 36 are placed 2 cm upstream of the detector 38 to be illuminated by the full cross-section of the x-ray beam 20. Using \u0394\u03b8\u22453 mrad, the spatial separation between diffraction orders at the detector 38 will be 60 \u03bcm, which can be resolved with a YAG:Ce scintillator and a visible-light CCD camera.",
                                "The resolution of such an instrument in which the x-ray beam 20 is focused on the detector 38 is determined by uncertainties of the wavelength and the scattering angle, (\u0394Q/Q)2=(\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)2+(\u0394\u03b8/\u03b8)2. Assuming ICS bandwidth of 5%, (\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb)2\u22452.5\u00d710\u22123. The geometric contribution is (\u0394\u03b8)2=(b2+p2)/SDD2+\u2202FE2. Here, SDD is the sample-to-detector distance (2 cm in this example); b is the size of the direct-beam spot on the detector 38; p is the intrinsic resolution of the detector 38; and \u2202FE\u22455 \u03bcrad is the figure error of the mirrors 30. The direct-beam size, b, is determined by the source diameter of 3 \u03bcm, and the magnification of the optics 26. Optimally, the magnification of the optics 26 is such that b\u2245p, which determines the magnification, M. Assuming b\u2245p\u224510 \u03bcm, the width of the Bragg peaks, \u0394\u03b8\u22450.7 mrad. Therefore, the geometric contribution to the resolution (\u0394\u03b8/\u03b8)2 decreases quickly with increasing angles, as (\u0394\u03b8/\u03b8)2=0.05/n2, where n is the diffraction order number. Hence, the resolution of the optical system for CD-SAXS is mostly determined by the bandwidth of the source. The full source bandwidth, \u0394Q/Q\u2245\u0394\u03bb/\u03bb\u22455%, will resolve up to the 20th harmonic and can be narrowed if higher resolution is desired to reach even higher harmonics.",
                                "A schematic layout of the CD-SAXS optics is illustrated in FIG. 34. Elliptical Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors 27 focus the x-ray beam 20 at the detector 38, which records the intensity of the scattered photons as a function of the scattering angle, \u0398, from the sample 36. The source-to-optic distance (D), the magnification (M), and the optics length are adjusted according to the requirements for the instrument length, the source size and the pixel size of the detector 38. In the example here, D=30 cm, M=3, and the optic is about 20 cm long for a total beamline length of \u02dc120 cm.",
