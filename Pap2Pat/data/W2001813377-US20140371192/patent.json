    "abstract": "The present invention relates to alpha-form zinc-phthalocyanine nanowires (ZnPc NWs) having enhanced water solubility and water dispersibility, to a composite of an alpha-form zinc-phthalocyanine nanowire/phenothiazine, to a method for preparing same, and to a photosensitizer including same or a pharmaceutical composition including same for preventing or treating cancers. Since the alpha-form zinc-phthalocyanine nanowires or the composite of alpha-form zinc-phthalocyanine nanowire/phenothiazine according to the present invention exhibit dual traits, i.e., photothermal and photodynamic traits in single molecules, they are very useful for the development of a multifunctional molecular system and can also be usefully applied to light therapy of cancers due to their good light therapeutic effects. Also, the composite of alpha-form zinc-phthalocyanine nanowire/phenothiazine itself can exhibit fluorescence to facilitate the introduction of an imaging system, so that diagnosis and treatment can be simultaneously performed using a single substance.",

                        "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an advanced modality for the treatment of malignant tumors as it is widely used for clinical cancer treatments. This photodynamic therapy selectively destroys neoplastic lesions using cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by light activation of the photosensitizer. One of the crucial factors determining the photodynamic therapy efficacy is the photochemical and photophysical properties of the photosensitizer.",
                        "The photosensitizers are classified into the following four main classes: porphyrin derivatives, chlorine, porphycenes, and phthalocyanines (Pcs). Among these, metallo-phthalocyanine (MPc) has attracted considerable interest, having a photodynamic (PD) property that can be readily tuned by the type of central metal ion and the functional groups introduced as a phthalocyanine (Pc) ring substituent. Zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) is known to exhibit a high photodynamic effect as it possesses a diamagnetic Zn(II) central metal ion whose d shell is fully occupied, by which the yield of triplet excited state with long lifetime essential for the generation of ROS becomes high. Moreover, ZnPc has a large absorption cross-section of light at the tissue-penetrating spectral range of 650-900 nm.",
                        "The biggest problem for most photosensitizers, including ZnPc, for the photodynamic therapy is the low physiological acceptance level due to their high hydrophobic characteristics responsible for the poor solubility in a bodily fluid. To overcome this problem, ZnPc derivatives, such as tetrasulfonated ZnPc (ZnPcS4), [1,2,3,4-tetrakis(\u03b1/\u03b2-D-galactopyranos-6-yl)-phthalocyaninato]zinc, tetra- and octa-triethyleneoxysulfonyl substituted ZnPc, have been designed to increase the water solubility. Moreover, various delivery vehicles including liposome, emulsion, and nanoparticles have also been developed to transport water-insoluble photosensitizers to targets.",
                        "However, these approaches require multiple and complex chemical functionalization steps, during which the photoactivity could be reduced by destroying the original electronic conjugation system of the photosensitizer. Another challenging issue is the realization of a photosensitizer that exhibits both photodynamic and photothermal effects simultaneously to conduct dual synergistic phototherapy, which is rarely found from a single photosensitizer.",
                        "Moreover, in the photodynamic therapy, a fluorescence imaging system is used to accurately determine the location of the photosensitizer in the body and the concentration of the photosensitizer accumulated in target cells, and thus it is possible to accurately treat cancer cells in a local area. Among various photosensitizers, zinc-phthalocyanine nanowires can absorb light at long wavelengths and generate much more reactive oxygen species due to the presence of zinc atoms, but the introduction into the fluorescence imaging system is not easy due to the absence of fluorescence.",
                        "Therefore, there is a need to develop a composite in which a material that exhibits fluorescence is introduced to overcome these drawbacks."

The (002) lattice spacing of 1.14 nm (part B) agrees well with the XRD result (d(002)=11.5 \u212b at 2\u03b8=7.66\u00b0).

Therefore, the coordination power of water molecules to the central Zn(II) ion was examined by adding water into a DMF solution of ZnPc nanowire at various volume ratios.",

Upon increase of water fraction, the Soret band gradually shifts to higher energy (up to 330 nm), and the solution color changes from green to blue. The blue shift of the Soret band implies that DMF molecules pre-coordinated to the Zn(II) ion are replaced by water molecules that have stronger coordination power.",

The site where both the hydrogen bonding and coordination of water to the Zn(ii) ion are available is wider in ZnPc nanowire (\u03b1-form) than in ZnPc powder. The reason for this is that all Zn(II) ions in \u03b2-form powder are pre-coordinated to the framework nitrogen atoms of neighboring ZnPc (FIG. 13), resulting in the loss of both Zn(II) and N interaction sites. This is the main reason for the high stability of \u03b2-form ZnPc powder. On the contrary, all of the hydrogen bonding and water coordination sites are freely available in \u03b1-form ZnPc nanowire. Among the \u03b1-form ZnPc nanowires, shorter \u03b1-form ZnPc nanowire has a large surface area, which exhibits higher water solubility (see FIG. 8).",

As briefly mentioned, monomeric of ZnPc has PD activity due to its long-lived triplet states. However, the stacking of ZnPc molecules via \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction causes transfer of the triplet excitation energy, resulting in a shortened triplet state lifetime together with an increased probability of non-radiative relaxation.
