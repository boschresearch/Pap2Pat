                        "1. Targeting Therapy",
                        "Cancer-related diseases have become a serious problem in recent years. According to a report from WHO, 8.2 million people died of cancer-related diseases in 2012, accounting for 13.2% of all deaths. Chemotherapy is one of the methods used to treat cancer. Chemotherapy refers to a treatment method that kills cancer cells by allowing an anticancer drug to circulate in the body. Although chemotherapy offers the advantage of being lowly invasive, the burden placed on the patient's body attributable to adverse side effects is considerable and there are also various restrictions placed on the administration method. Consequently, there is a need to develop anticancer drugs that are able to provide treatment while suppressing adverse side effects while also being able to kill cancer cells, reduce the burden on the patient and improve quality of life (QOL).",
                        "Although current chemotherapy typically uses low molecular weight compounds, these compounds also damage normal cells and cause serious adverse side effects. One method for solving this problem is targeting therapy. Targeting therapy refers to modifying a drug with a targeting substance (ligand) that binds to a receptor specifically present only on cancer cells, thereby enabling the drug to be selectively delivered only to cancer tissue with the aim of improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing adverse side effects. At present, low molecular weight substances such as folic acid or hydrocarbons and naturally-occurring compounds such as peptides, proteins, aptamers or antibodies are known to be used as ligands. The advantage of this therapy is that pharmacological effects can be maximized and adverse side effects can be alleviated by combining various types of ligands and drugs, thereby making it possible to use drugs that were previously not applied clinically due to their potent toxicity. One example of a targeting therapy drug consists of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) obtained by introducing a drug into an antibody that binds with an antigen specifically present on a cancer cell. Two types of ADCs consisting of trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin are currently applied clinically and have been confirmed to reduce adverse side effects and improve therapeutic efficacy (NPL1 and NPL2). In addition, therapeutic drugs that use, for example, folic acid, which targets folate receptors (FR) expressed in excess on cancer cells, as a ligand, are also undergoing clinical trials (NPL3). In this manner, targeting therapy drugs obtained by introducing a drug into a ligand are considered to be extremely useful for improving the pharmacological effects of anticancer drugs.",
                        "2. Transporters",
                        "As a result of cells becoming malignant, glycolytic pathways are accelerated resulting in the consumption of large amounts of glucose. Consequently, glucose transporters that take up glucose are expressed in excess on the surface of cancer cells resulting in excess uptake of glucose. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET), in which a portion of the hydrogen atoms of glucose are converted to 18F, is used practically for cancer diagnosis by utilizing this increased uptake of glucose in cancer cells (NPL4).",
                        "In addition, uptake of amino acids is similarly increased in malignant cells. This is because large amounts of amino acids are required in comparison with normal cells since cancer cells are engaged in rapid growth and protein synthesis. Transporters that take up various amino acids are expressed in excess in cancer cells.",
                        "Among these amino acids, glutamine uptake in particular is activated in cancer cells. Uptake of glutamine by cancer cells is known to be accelerated 10-fold to 30-fold in comparison with normal cells. Glutamine is taken up by means of glutamine transporters and catabolized into glutamic acid and \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid in cells by enzymes such as glutaminase (GLS), after which it is incorporated into the TCA cycle to produce ATP. Drugs that inhibit the enzyme GLS, which catabolizes glutamine to glutamic acid, demonstrate a certain growth inhibitory effect. In addition, glutamine is also known to be catabolized into asparagine and used in DNA synthesis. Uptake of glutamine is promoted by signaling such as MYC signaling that promotes the glycolytic pathway. The TCA cycle can be maintained due to this action. In this manner, excess uptake of glutamine has a considerable effect on maintaining the cancer environment.",
                        "There are various glutamine transporters responsible for transporting glutamine. Glutamine transporters can be broadly divided into Na+-dependent and Na+-independent types, with systems A, N, ASC and BOAT2 belonging to the Na+-dependent type and system L belonging to the Na+-independent type. Among these, ASCT2, belonging to system ASC, is thought to fulfill a significant role in the uptake of glutamine into cancer cells. ASCT2 has high affinity for alanine, serine and cysteine (Km=30 \u03bcM to 90 \u03bcM) and is involved in the uptake of various amino acids. ASCT2 is particularly involved in the uptake of glutamine and demonstrates especially high affinity for glutamine (Km=20 \u03bcM). This is due to chirality of the carbon moiety at the \u03b1-position of glutamine (L-type) and the number of carbon atoms between the amino group and carboxy group being one, thereby resulting in the generation of potent electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding with ASCT2.",
                        "PET probes using glutamine have been developed with the focus on cancer-specific uptake of glutamine, and particularly on the increased uptake of glutamine by ASCT2 (NPL5 and NPL6)."

                                "Although targeting therapy drugs demonstrate a certain therapeutic effect, they also have several problems. The first problem is the diversity of cancer. For example, folate receptors (FR) are known to have considerably different receptor expression levels depending on the cancer (NPL3). Similarly, in the case of antibodies as well, the type of antigen that is expressed in excess differs according to the type of cancer (NPL2). Consequently, if the type of cancer varies, that cancer cannot be targeted with a single ligand thereby ending up resulting in limitations on treatment.",
                                "The second problem is the non-uniformity of cancer. This means that receptors may be expressed at different levels or not expressed at all since the phenotype of each cancer cell varies even within the same cancer tissue. Consequently, cancer cells that do not express receptors cannot be targeted by ligands thereby resulting in the risk of relapse due to the presence of residual cancer cells. In order to solve this problem, it is important to seek out sufficiently expressed receptors regardless of the type of cancer or cell and develop ligands capable of targeting those receptors.",
                                "In addition, the third problem is adverse side effects. Ligands currently applied clinically exhibit extremely high binding strength with receptors and are capable of binding to individual receptors, and the expression levels of targeted receptors is also extremely high. However, since these receptors are expressed on the surfaces of normal cells at about \u2153 to \u00bc the level of cancer cells, even though adverse side effects are alleviated in comparison with conventional anticancer drugs, these ligands end up causing adverse side effects as a result of also binding to normal cells. In this manner, when conventional methods are used consisting of selecting binding based on the presence or absence of a receptor with a ligand that strongly binds to that receptor, the ligand also ends up binding to normal cells expressing that receptor thereby resulting in the occurrence of adverse side effects. In order to solve this problem, a ligand capable of selecting targeting based on the expression level of a receptor and not on the presence or absence of that receptor is considered to be useful. Such a ligand would not target normal cells having low receptor expression levels but rather would be able to realize targeting of only cancer cells demonstrating high expression levels, thereby making it possible to achieve further alleviation of adverse side effects.",
                                "Moreover, in the case of using antibody-drug conjugates, the number of drugs that can be loaded onto an antibody molecule is extremely low at roughly three to four per antibody. In addition, there are also the problems of the difficulty in synthesizing large amounts due to the use of antibodies while also being extremely expensive.",
                                "Glutamine is considered to be extremely useful as a novel ligand capable of targeting cancer cells since cancer cells express glutamine transporters in excess and demonstrate increased uptake of glutamine that is 10 times to 30 times greater in comparison with normal cells.",
                                "However, in the case of considering the use of glutamine alone as a ligand, the glutamine is predicted to not be able to function as a ligand since binding strength between the glutamine and transporter is weaker than the binding strength typically required by ligand molecules. For example, the value of Michaelis constant Km, which is an indicator of the affinity between ASCT2 and glutamine, is 20 \u03bcM. On the other hand, the dissociation constant Kd is used as an indicator of ligand binding strength, and affinity and binding strength are higher the smaller the value of Km and Kd. By definition, although the dissociation constants of ASCT2 and glutamine are thought to adopt a value smaller than 20 \u03bcM, which is the aforementioned Michaelis constant, it is unlikely that this value reaches the order of 10 nM, which is typically required by ligands.",
                                "Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a ligand that is capable of selectively targeting all types of cancer."

This is thought to be the result of Cy5-P[Lys(G1n)]106 being taken up more easily due to its greater binding strength to cells in comparison with Cy5-P[Lys(G1n)]46, thereby enabling uptake of Cy5-P[Lys(G1n)]106 to have reached saturation in a shorter amount of time. On the other hand, although uptake continued to increase up to 24 hours in the cases of Cy5-P[Lys(\u03b1-Glu)]46 and Cy5-P[Lys(\u03b1-Glu)]106, this is thought to be due to weak binding strength with cells, thereby preventing uptake from reaching saturation in 24 hours.",
