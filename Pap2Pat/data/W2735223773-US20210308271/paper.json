    "title": "Engineering Tumour Cell-Binding Synthetic Polymers with Sensing Dense Transporters Associated with Aberrant Glutamine Metabolism",
    "date": "2017-07-20",
    "abstract": "Increased glutamine uptake toward the elevated glutaminolysis is one of the hallmarks of tumour cells. This aberrant glutamine metabolism has recently attracted considerable attention as a diagnostic and therapeutic target. Herein, we developed glutamine-functionalized polymer to achieve a selective high affinity to tumour cells overexpressing glutaminolysis-related transporter ASCT2. In in vitro study, our developed polymer exhibited faster and higher cellular uptake in tumour cells than that in normal cells. Uptake inhibition study revealed the dominant contribution of ASCT2 to the polymer-cell interaction. Furthermore, the binding affinity of the polymer to tumour cells was estimated to be comparable to that of the potent ligand molecules reported in the literature. In in vivo study, the polymer showed prolonged retention at tumour site after intratumoral injection. This study offers a novel approach for designing tumour cell-binding synthetic polymers through the recognition of dense transporters related to tumour-associated metabolism.",

                "Tumour cells exhibit distinctive metabolic activities compared to normal differentiated cells because of their genetic and epigenetic alteration1, 2 One of the major metabolic pathways in tumour cells is a high rate of glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, also known as Warburg effect1, 3. Although the Warburg effect was first described in 19242, 3, other tumour-related metabolic alterations such as lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutamine metabolism, have been revealed during the last decade. In addition, recent advances in metabolomics, which is the comprehensive analysis of the metabolite, have provided in-depth understanding of these metabolic activities. Owing to these recent efforts, tumour-related metabolisms have been recently recognized as one of the hallmarks of tumour cells, and thus have been attracted much attention as a therapeutic and diagnostic target.",
                "Among tumour-related metabolisms, elevated glutaminolysis plays a critical role for tumour growth and survival by supporting macromolecular biosynthesis, ATP production, and redox balance regulation4, 5. To satisfy the increased demand of glutamine from elevated glutaminolysis, tumour cells overexpress glutamine transporters. In particular, system ASC transporter 2 (ASCT2) has been demonstrated to be overexpressed on various tumour cells including hepatocellular carcinoma6, prostate cancer7, and breast cancer8. In addition, inhibition of ASCT2 function has resulted in a decrease of glutamine uptake and suppression of tumour cell growth7\u20139, indicating the dominant contribution of ASCT2 for glutamine uptake in tumour cells and tumour growth.",
                "Focusing on increased glutamine uptake by ASCT2 in tumour cells, glutamine has been utilized as an imaging agent like 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, which has been clinically used as a powerful diagnosis tool to visualize the malignant tissues possessing the augmented glucose uptake. Previous studies have indeed demonstrated the successful in vivo tumour imaging using glutamine analogue PET probes10, 11. Considering this promising potential, glutamine is expected to be used as an ASCT2-targeting ligand molecule; however, glutamine-based ligand has yet to be developed probably due to weak binding affinity of glutamine to ASCT2. Dissociation constant (K d) of glutamine to ASCT2 was estimated to be 20 \u03bcM12, whereas K d value of potent ligands to their receptors should be tens of nanomolar range13. Thus, chemical design of glutamine-functionalized molecules toward improvement of this weak binding affinity is prerequisite to utilize glutamine as a ligand. In this regard, multivalent effect offers a promising strategy because multiple ligand-transporter interaction can dramatically enhance the binding affinity associated with high transporter density on target cells14\u201316. In addition, such multivalent interaction is unlikely to occur on cell surface with low target receptor density16. Thus, it is hypothesized that multivalent glutamine ligand permits selective affinity to tumour cells overexpressing ASCT2.",
                "Herein, on the basis of our hypothesis, we designed poly(L-lysine) derivatives having glutamine moieties at the side chain, and examined whether these glutamine-functionalized polymers can provide a selective high affinity to tumour cells overexpressing ASCT2 as shown in Fig.\u00a01. Our results show that glutamine-functionalized polymer strongly interacted with dense ASCT2 on tumour cells. Moreover, this strong interaction was observed even in in vivo tumour tissue.Figure 1Design of glutamine-functionalized polymer and interaction of the polymer with cell surface. (a,b) Chemical structure of PLys(Gln)-n (a) and PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-n (b). (c) Illustration of interaction between the glutamine-functionalized polymer and cell surface. The polymer strongly interacts with tumour cell surface by multivalent interaction associated with high transporter density. In contrast, the polymer weakly interacts with normal cell surface because of low transporter density."

                        "A series of glutamine-functionalized polymers were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride and subsequent modification of the side chain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1\u2013S4). Briefly, azide-functionalized poly(L-lysine) was first synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride of \u03b5-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine and deprotection of trifluoroacetyl group. Then, the side chain was modified to have glutamine moieties through \u03b3-amide linkage. It should be noted that modification of \u03b3-amide group of glutamine is expected to tolerate the transporter-glutamine interaction as reported in a previous study, where glutamine analogues with \u03b3-amide modification strongly inhibited ASCT2 function17. Finally, dibenzocyclooctyne modified Cy5 fluorescence dye was reacted with azide terminus of the polymer by copper-free click chemistry, for the detection of polymers by fluorescence in subsequent experiments. The resulting polymers were termed as PLys(Gln)-n (Fig.\u00a01a), where n is the mean degree of polymerization (DP). In this design, polymer length is a crucial factor for multivalent interaction with surface transporters. Accordingly, the polymers having the different length (DP was 30, 50, and 100) were synthesized. Meanwhile, control polymers (termed as PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-n (Fig.\u00a01b), n is DP) were prepared in the same manner with minor modification: glutamine moieties were changed to \u03b1-glutamyl moieties to investigate the effect of chemical structure of the side chain on binding affinity. Quantitative modification of lysine residue and narrow molecular weight distribution were confirmed for all polymers by 1H NMR and size exclusion chromatography, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S5\u2013S12)."

Immunohistochemical analysis of a subcutaneous BxPC3 (human pancreatic cancer cell) tumour in a mouse with anti-human/murine ASCT2 antibody revealed that ASCT2 was distinctly overexpressed in the tumour compared to normal tissues (Fig.\u00a02a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S13), suggesting that ASCT2 can be a potential target transporter on cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated the overexpression of ASCT2 on BxPC3 cells compared to the HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells (Fig.\u00a02b,c). In addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed 4.8-fold higher expression of ASCT2 on BxPC3 cells compared to normal HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S14). This overexpression ratio is in line with previous studies, where tumour cells showed approximately 2- to 10-fold higher expression of ASCT2 compared to their counterparts7, 18, 19. Thus, we used these cell lines for the assessment of interaction between the developed polymers and ASCT2 in in vitro studies.Figure 2 In vivo and in vitro expression of ASCT2.

                        "To examine the cellular interaction of PLys(Gln)-n with cultured tumour cells, the flow cytometric analysis was performed. The cellular uptake was quantified by measuring Cy5 fluorescence intensity from the cells treated with the polymers (Fig.\u00a03a). A series of PLys(Gln)-n exhibited DP-dependent uptake behaviour; PLys(Gln)-100 showed the highest uptake in BxPC3 cells, which was 9.7-fold and 18-fold higher than that of PLys(Gln)-50 and PLys(Gln)-30, respectively. Similar DP-dependent interaction was also observed in HepG2 (human liver cancer) cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S15), which overexpress ASCT2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S14, ref. 20). According to a previous study, the interaction potency of multivalent polymeric ligand was exponentially enhanced by an increase of the polymer length21. Thus, this drastically high cellular uptake of PLys(Gln)-100 is probably due to the multivalent interaction between the polymer and the tumour cells.Figure 3Cellular uptake analysis of the polymers.

                        "To investigate the tumour specificity of PLys(Gln)-100, the time-dependent cellular uptake was evaluated using HEK293 cells as well as BxPC3 cells (Fig.\u00a03b). PLys(Gln)-100 exhibited faster uptake in BxPC3 cells compared to HEK293 cells. After 8\u2009h incubation, PLys(Gln)-100 uptake in BxPC3 cells was 4.7-fold higher than that in HEK293 cells. These results are consistent with the scheme that PLys(Gln)-100 might strongly interact with tumour cells overexpressing ASCT2 through the strong multivalent effect, while weakly interacting with normal cells because of less binding sites as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01c.",
                        "To get insight about the effect of chemical structure on this cellular interaction, we investigated the time-dependent cellular uptake of PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100. This polymer was used as a control polymer because it has same molecular weight and neutral charge with PLys(Gln)-100 with the different position of free amine group at the side chain. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c, PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 revealed slightly higher uptake in BxPC3 cells compared to HEK293 cells. Considering that glutamate weakly interacted with ASCT222, 23, it could be assumed that PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 having glutamate-like structure at the side chain might interact with ASCT2 to some extent and exhibit multivalent effect. Consistent with this assumption, a series of PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-n also showed DP-dependent uptake behaviour in cultured cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S16). However, compared to PLys(Gln)-100, PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 exhibited slower uptake in BxPC3 cells and lower uptake ratio between BxPC3 and HEK293 cells. The relatively high affinity of PLys(Gln)-100 to tumour cells is probably due to its chemical structure at the side chain, which is similar to potent ASCT2 inhibitor having \u03b3-amide modified glutamine structure17, 24."

                        "To examine the transporter specificity of the developed polymers, cellular uptake was evaluated with several inhibitors for glutamine transporters: ASCT2, system A, system L, and system N transporters. For their inhibitors, we used O-benzyl-L-serine (BzlSer, ASCT2 inhibitor), 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB, system A inhibitor), 2-amino-2-norbornanecarboxylic acid (BCH, system L inhibitor), and L-glutamine (Gln, system N inhibitor). As shown in Fig.\u00a04a, only BzlSer exhibited strong concentration-dependent inhibitory effect, while the other inhibitors showed negligible inhibitory effect, indicating the dominant contribution of ASCT2 to the uptake of PLys(Gln)-100. Similar inhibitory effects were also observed for PLys(Gln)-50 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S17). Among above-mentioned glutamine transporters, ASCT2 has relatively high affinity with glutamine (Michaelis constant (K m) is 20\u201360 \u03bcM12, 23, whereas the other transporters has K m in the range of approximately 150\u20131600 \u03bcM25\u201328). Because of this relatively strong interaction between ASCT2 and glutamine molecule, ASCT2 could be a dominant target transporter for PLys(Gln)-n. Moreover, the overexpression of ASCT2 on BxPC3 cells as shown in Fig.\u00a02c may also contribute to the dominant role of ASCT2 for tumour cell-selective interaction of PLys(Gln)-n. Cellular uptake of PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 was also inhibited by only BzlSer while its inhibitory effect was higher compared to that of PLys(Gln)-100 (Fig.\u00a04b), suggesting that PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 modestly interacted with ASCT2.Figure 4Cellular uptake analysis of PLys(Gln)-100 and PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 in the presence of transporter inhibitors.

As shown in Fig.\u00a05a, in the BxPC3 cells incubated with PLys(Gln)-100 at 37\u2009\u00b0C, the polymer (red) was located at intracellular space, and colocalized (yellow) with the late endosome/lysosome indicator, Lysotracker Red (green). In contrast, when BxPC3 cells were incubated with the polymer at 4\u2009\u00b0C to suppress the endocytosis, the polymer was located only on the cellular membrane, and did not colocalize with the late endosome/lysosomes. In addition, mean fluorescence intensity from the cells incubated with the polymer at 4\u2009\u00b0C was significantly lower compared to that of 37\u2009\u00b0C incubation (Fig.\u00a05c). These results indicate that PLys(Gln)-100 first attached to the cell membrane through the polymer-ASCT2 interaction, and the attached polymer was internalized by endocytosis. Note that similar behaviours in subcellular distribution were observed for PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 and PLys(Gln)-50 (Fig.\u00a05b,d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S18), indicating that these polymers were also internalized by endocytosis after interacting with ASCT2 on cell surface.Figure 5Subcellular distribution of PLys(Gln)-100 and PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100.

                "Previous studies revealed potential of aberrant glutamine metabolism as a target of cancer therapy and diagnosis4, 7\u201311, 31, and this aberrant metabolism accompanies overexpression of the corresponding amino acid transporters including ASCT26\u20138 as we also demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo (Fig.\u00a02 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S13). While previous research utilized increased cellular uptake of glutamine to visualize accelerated metabolism10, 11, 31, this study focused on these overexpressed transporters on tumour cells, and developed the polymer functionalized with glutamine molecules for exerting selective affinity to tumour cells through multivalent effect.",
                "Although exact mechanism of interaction between ASCT2 and glutamine or glutamine-analogues is not fully understood, a previous study has proposed key structures of glutamine-analogues to get a high affinity to ASCT2: \u03b1-amine and \u03b1-carboxyl groups for charge interaction, \u03b3-amide group for hydrogen binding, and modified side chain for hydrophobic interaction17. As most potent ASCT2 inhibitors have \u03b1-amine and \u03b1-carboxyl groups, these chemical structures appeared to be important for glutamine-ASCT2 interaction. Indeed, PLys(Gln)-100 that has \u03b1-amine and \u03b1-carboxyl groups at the side chain showed higher affinity both in in vitro and in vivo compared to PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 although the difference between these polymers is just the position of amine group at the side chain. In addition to \u03b1-amine and \u03b1-carboxyl groups, glutamine-like structure should be important for achieving ASCT2 selective interaction because amino acids transporters generally recognize these functional groups. For instance, \u03b1-amine and \u03b1-carboxyl groups are key components for the substrates of system L transporter 1 (LAT1)32, which is overexpressed on a variety of tumour cells33\u201335. Given that LAT1 is reported to be expressed on BxPC3 cells36, PLys(Gln)-100 was expected to interact with LAT1 as well as ASCT2 if amino acids transporters recognize just the side chain terminus of the polymers. However, as shown in Fig.\u00a04a, LAT1 inhibitor BCH did not inhibit the PLys(Gln)-100 uptake in BxPC3 cells while ASCT2 inhibitor BzlSer strongly inhibited the uptake. This ASCT2-selective interaction of PLys(Gln)-100 suggests that ASCT2 may recognize not merely \u03b1-amine and \u03b1-carboxyl groups but whole glutamine-like structure (including \u03b3-amide groups) of the side chain.",
                "On the other hand, given that PLys(Gln)-100 and PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 has the same valency and density of the binding motifs, moderate interaction between PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 and ASCT2 might be attributed to the recognition of glutamate-like structure at the side chain by ASCT2. This explanation is consistent with previous reports, where glutamate did not interact with system L and system N glutamine transporters but weakly interacted with ASCT222, 23, 27, 37. In addition, this glutamate-ASCT2 interaction was reported to be pH-dependent; a decrease of pH could enhance the interaction capacity of glutamate with ASCT217, 23. In line with this report, PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 showed higher uptake in BxPC3 cells at pH 6.5 compared to that at pH 7.4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S20). However, this increased cellular uptake of PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 at pH 6.5 was still lower than that of PLys(Gln)-100, indicating that even at the intratumoral pH (~ 6.5) PLys(Gln)-100 should be the preferred structure for achieving high affinity to ASCT2.",
                "As aforementioned, the fine-tuning of DP and chemical structure at the side chain permits the selective interaction of the polymer to dense ASCT2. Given that the overexpression ratio of ASCT2 between BxPC3 and HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S14) is comparable to that in clinical studies7, 18, 19, the tumour-selective interaction of the polymer as shown in Fig.\u00a03 strongly indicates the potential in vivo activity of our synthesized polymer for tumour-targeting ligand. In our synthetic strategy, the Cy5 fluorescence dye can be easily replaced with the other functional molecules including drugs, diagnostic agents, and functional macromolecules. Hence, the glutamine-based ligand would be potentially useful as a versatile platform for delivering such functional molecules to diseased sites related to aberrant glutamine metabolism. However, systemic application of this polymer still requires optimization. For example, PLys(Gln)-100 would be rapidly eliminated from the body because the molecular weight of the polymer is lower than the threshold of renal clearance38; it would have few chances of interacting with tumour tissue after systemic administration. Thus, the design of glutamine-based ligand with suitable architecture for long blood circulation and appropriate binding affinity to the target cell is our future interests.",
                "In summary, we developed the novel glutamine-functionalized polymer with a high affinity to tumour cells overexpressing glutaminolysis-related transporter ASCT2. The glutamine-functionalized polymer exhibited enhanced cellular uptake in the cultured cells by strong interaction with ASCT2. Even in in vivo environment, the glutamine-functionalized polymer showed prolonged retention at tumour site, indicating the potent binding affinity to tumour. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report utilizing glutamine as a functional molecule showing a high affinity to tumour cells, inspired by tumour-associated metabolism.

Briefly, for the synthesis of azide-PLys-100, the NCA-Lys(TFA) (2.16\u2009g, 8.1\u2009mmol) was polymerized in distilled DMSO (10\u2009mL) initiated by 11-azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine (16 \u03bcl, 0.081\u2009mmol) at room temperature for 3 days under argon atmosphere. The polymer was purified by dialysis against MeOH (MWCO: 1,000). The dialyzed solution in MeOH was then evaporated and dried in vacuo to obtain azide-PLys(TFA)-100 (1.73\u2009g, yield\u2009=\u200992%). The polydispersity (M w/M n) of the obtained polymer was determined to be 1.2 by gel permeation chromatography [column: TSK-gel superAW3000, superAW4000, and superAWL-guard column (Tosoh Corporation, Yamaguchi, Japan); eluent: NMP containing 50\u2009mM LiBr; flow rate: 0.3\u2009ml/min; detector: refractive index (RI); temperature: 40\u2009\u00b0C].

When average tumour volume reached approximately 150 mm3, 20 \u03bcl of PLys(Gln)-100, PLys(Gln)-50, or PLys(\u03b1-Glu)-100 solution (40 \u03bcM in PBS) was intratumorally injected (n\u2009=\u20093). At 0.25, 1, 4, and 8\u2009h after injection, the mice were imaged by in vivo imaging system (IVIS, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using 640\u2009nm/680\u2009nm ex/em filter. Average radiant efficiency of the tumour region was quantified using Living Image software."
