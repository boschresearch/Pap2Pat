    "title": "CTRLsum: Towards Generic Controllable Text Summarization",
    "date": "2020-12-08",
    "abstract": "Current summarization systems yield generic summaries that are disconnected from users' preferences and expectations. To address this limitation, we present CTRLsum, a novel framework for controllable summarization. Our approach enables users to control multiple aspects of generated summaries by interacting with the summarization system through textual input in the form of a set of keywords or descriptive prompts. Using a single unified model, CTRLsum is able to achieve a broad scope of summary manipulation at inference time without requiring additional human annotations or pre-defining a set of control aspects during training. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three domains of summarization datasets and five control aspects: 1) entity-centric and 2) length-controllable summarization, 3) contribution summarization on scientific papers, 4) invention purpose summarization on patent filings, and 5) question-guided summarization on news articles in a reading comprehension setting. Moreover, when used in a standard, uncontrolled summarization setting, CTRLsum achieves state-of-the-art results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

                "Neural summarization systems aim to compress a document into a short paragraph or sentence while preserving key information. There are two common categories of summarization systems: extractive summarization where models find and copy important portions of a documents (Cheng and Lapata, 2016;Nallapati et al., 2017;Narayan et al., 2018), and abstractive summarization where models freely generates novel sentences (Rush et al., 2015;See et al., 2017;Paulus et al., 2018). The focus of this work is on abstractive summarization.",
                "In a common setting, summarization methods take a source document as input and yield a generic summary which covers content selected arbitrarily by the model. However, to be useful, automatically generated summaries should cover content considered important by the readers. For example, Figure 1 shows an NBA basketball news article, and the reference summary aggregates the results of several matches. Yet fans of certain players or teams might only be interested in the matches and statistics which include their entities of interest.",
                "Motivated by this observation, in this work we focus on controllable summarization which allows the users to control the generated summaries. We propose CTRLSUM, a framework to control summaries through a set of keywords. At training time, the model learns to predict summaries conditioned on both the source document and keywords, which are easily identified from training summaries. During inference, a control function is designed depending on the specific control aspect to map user preference to keywords to control the summary.",
                "While simple, keywords provide a clean separation of test-time user control and the training process -different dimensions of the generated summary could be controlled through engineering the test-time control function, while the training process and pretrained model remain unchanged. In contrast, typical controllable summarization methods (Fan et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2018;Tan et al., 2020;Suhara et al., 2020;Chan et al., 2021) predefine the specific control aspect (e.g. entity, length, topic, etc.) and rely on the corresponding control annotations during training. Consequently, they require to train a separate model for each control aspect and cannot generalize to new control aspects at test time. Figure 1 demonstrates such distinction. The training process in CTRLSUM is agnostic to the specific control aspect, leading to possibly Dwyane Wade scored 21 of his 32 points in the first half and Goran Dragic added 20 as the Miami Heat handed LeBron James another loss on his former home floor with a 106-92 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday \u2026\u2026 [ignoring 60 tokens] James scored 16 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter for Cleveland, which had its fourgame winning streak snapped.

This way, g control provides clean separation of test-time user control and the training process -through only engineering the control function, the same trained model can be adapted to new control tasks without changing model parameters or the training process. Such a framework is generic and broadly applicable to many control aspects, which stands in contrast to previous work on controllable summarization (Fan et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2018) which pre-define one control aspect and design a specific training procedure for it. In \u00a73 we will show how the same model is applied to five different controllable summarization tasks.",

Therefore, we focus on several specific, well-defined control tasks as to be shown in \u00a73.",

Similar to training time extraction, we first select n s sentences with the highest average token selection probability. Within these sentences words with q j > \u03f5 are selected as keywords up to a maximum number of m max . n s , \u03f5, m max are hyperparameters selected based on the unconstrained summarization performance on validation datasets, and the results are reasonably robust to different values, as shown in Appendix G."

                "Previous work on controllable summarization often collects control codes as supervision (Fan et al., 2018;Liu et al., 2018). For example, Fan et al. (2018) utilizes an entity tagger tool to identify entities from the reference summary, and input those entities together with the document during training for entity control. They also study length control by training a separate model with length code as the additional input. Other work mostly focus on a specific control task in limited settings (Saito et al., 2020a;Tan et al., 2020;Suhara et al., 2020), yet CTRLsum aims for a more generic framework. Keyword-guided summarization has been applied in different contexts or with distinct motivations. Keywords are used as extra input to improve unconstrained summarization or reduce hallucinations (Gehrmann et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018;Saito et al., 2020b;Elsahar et al., 2021;Dou et al., 2021). CTRLsum is also related to query-focused summarization (Dang, 2005;Wan et al., 2007;Xu andLapata, 2020, 2022), these methods often work with datasets that provide annotated queries, and did not focus on generic control tasks.

                "(2) CTRLSUM is not taught to handle \"unrelated user input\" which may raise unwanted model behaviors. For instance, if a user inputs \"war gun kill\" as the keywords by mistake to an NBA news article, then the model may make up factually incorrect content that includes the keywords. (3) CTRLSUM requires an additional tagger to perform unconstrained summarization in a pipeline fashion which is more complicated than typical summarization models. This may be resolved by training CTRLsum with a multi-task objective, using special keyword symbols or empty keywords to trigger the unconstrained summarization task.",
                "The training of CTRLsum leads to strong dependence of the summaries on the input keywords, thus the summaries would almost always include the keywords in the generated summary from our observation, even when the keywords do not appear in the article or represent toxic information. This allows humans to deliberately create malicious content from CTRLsum, for example, through inputting racism or aggression words. A potential remedy is to train a toxicity classifier, and let the model replace the toxic keywords with automatic keywords.  and Ba, 2015) and batch size is 64. Our optimization scheme and hyperparameters follow the BART fine-tuning instructions in fairseq examples. We train the summarization models with 20k steps on CNNDM, 50k steps on arXiv, and 300k steps on BIGPATENT. We train the BERT tagger with learning rate 5e-5, Adam optimizer, and batch size of 128 on all datasets. Similar to summarization models, the tagger is trained with 20k, 50k, and 300k steps on CNNDM, arXiv, and BIGPATENT respectively. Also, we adopt a sliding window approach so that the BERT-based tagger is able to handle sequences that are longer than 512 tokens.11 For both ROUGE and BERTScore evaluation, we report the F1 measure. We report the rescaled BERTScore, and the hash code is \"roberta -large_L17_noidf _version = 0.3.6(hug_trans = 3.0.2)rescaled\". As mentioned in \u00a72.3, we need three hyperparameters for automatic keywords extraction during inference when applicable -the number of pre-selected sentences n s , the selection probability threshold \u03f5, and the maximum number of keywords m max . We select these hyperparameters for each dataset based on the unconstrained summarization ROUGE-2 score on validation dataset. The summarization performance is robust to these hyperparameters in a reasonable range, as shown in Appendix G. Specifically, we use {n s = 10, \u03f5 = 0.25, m max = 30} for CNNDM, {n s = 10, \u03f5 = 0.15, m max = 40} for arXiv, and {n s = 5, \u03f5 = 0.15, m max = 30}. The order and sentence boundary of automatic keywords: for the automatic keywords extracted as in \u00a72.3, the keyword sequence maintains the order of the keywords as they were in the source document, but we observe that the model often ignores this ordering information as it frequently differs between source and target summary. 12 We also separate keywords from different source sentences with the special token (\"|\"), though in preliminary experiments we find that the model generation is not sensitive to the sentence boundary information at test time. At inference time in applications where the sentence boundary is unknown, as in most of our control tasks, the \"|\" token is ignored in the experiments. Invention Purpose Summarization: in the experiment of summarizing invention purpose on patent articles ( \u00a74.4), we examined whether the model would possibly copy source sentences through matching the prompts, we search strings in the form of \"the purpose of [some words or phrases] is\" among 763 test examples, and only 3 test articles are identified. This means the models are not generating by exactly matching prompts most of the time. Question-Guided Summarization: In Table 6, the GPT2-Large has 774M parameters while the BART architecture (including CTRLSUM) has 406M parameters. A note on the unconstrained summarization experiment: in our unconstrained summarization experiment ( \u00a74.6), we note that the BERT tagger gives CTRLSUM parameter advantages over the baselines, leading to a strictly unfair comparison. Such a (unfair) parameter advantage setting is also adopted in recent two-stage summarization work (Dou et al., 2021). We constrain the seq2seq model in CTRLSUM to be the same as the baseline to better directly observe the effect of keywords. Also, given that unconstrained summarization is not the main focus of this paper, we leave a strict parameter-control experiment for future work. GPU resources. All our models including the summarization model and tagger are trained on 8 NVIDIA Tesla 16GB V100 GPUs using a dataparallel mechanism. The GPUs are provided by Google Cloud."

                "Here we include details about human evaluation experiments in \u00a74.7. Unconstrained Summarization. For unconstrained summarization, we sample 100 examples for each dataset, and hire workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to conduct evaluation. Each example is scored by 3 independent workers and the resulted total number of participants are 15, 20, 22 for CNNDM, arXiv, and BIGPATENT respectively. We set the price of tasks in a way that will guarantee each worker an hourly wage of at least $12. The median score of 3 workers is taken for each example, and average over all examples is reported. For CNNDM we provide article and summaries, while for arXiv and BIGPATENT we provide reference and summaries using the reference summary as a surrogate for the source article. This is because the source patent documents or scientific papers are very long and hard to be read by non-expert humans. For each aspect to be scored (i.e. factual consistency, relevance, fluency, or coherence), we provide specific definitions of the aspect. Then for each example we present summaries from different systems together in random order to be evaluated. Note that different aspects are presented and scored separately since we noticed that the MTurkers tend to mix different aspect concepts and fail to distinguish them during evaluation if the four aspects are scored together. 13 An example screenshot of the instructions shown to the workers is demonstrated in Figure 2. Controlled Summarization. For controlled summarization, we sample 100 examples for each task, and summaries of each example from different systems are presented together in random order to the human annotator to be scored. For CNNDM we provide the source article, the control entities, and summaries, while for BIGPATENT we provide reference and summaries using the reference summary as a surrogate for the source article. This is because the source patent documents are very long and hard to be read by non-expert humans. We did not evaluate contribution summarization since it is unrealistic to ask non-expert humans to judge contributions of many scientific papers from various domains. We tried to hire workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk first, but unfortunately we failed to obtain reliable results from them -they often ignored the given control intent and tended to score the text as standard unconstrained summaries, which is reflected by very poor scores on unimportant-entityfocused summaries because these summaries do not focus on the important information of the article, even though we instructed them that the control intent is critical. We note that obtaining reliable human judgement for summarization from non-expert crowdsourcing workers remains an active research direction (Shapira et al., 2019), and it has been shown before that non-expert human judgement of summarization can exhibit poor correlation with expert judgement (Fabbri et al., 2021).",
                "To obtain more trustable human evaluation results for controlled summarization, we ask three our colleagues to evaluate through personal correspondence from the authors of this paper. They are able to follow the given control intent from our manual investigation and considered more reliable than the MTurkers. While we report important and unimportant entity control results separately, we abstract away the \"important/unimportant\" entity identities from human annotators and mix them for the annotators to score. Similar to the unconstrained setting, each example is evaluated by 3 annotators independently. Then we take the median score for each example and average over all examples to report the final score. Example screenshots of the instructions shown to the human annotators are demonstrated in Figure 3."

The control tokens for other settings are the same as previous experiments. Results are shown in Table 12, where keywords and prompts are of different importance for different tasks and are complementary in general. For example, using prompts to control entities turns out to be difficult with a very low success rate -we find that the system fails to understand the prompt and produce summaries appropriately in most cases. However, prompts contribute the most to contribution summarization with comparable performance with using prompts and keywords together, while removing prompts and using keywords alone suffers from drastic performance drop to trigger the contribution. For NewsQA task, prompts and keywords demonstrate mixing effectiveness -using either of them alone experiences over 20 F1 points loss compared to using them together."

The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. The decision was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the ACLU isn't satisfied with the government's new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). \"After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List,\" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we've found that the government's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again.\" People on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government's figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans. Before the change, American citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list. Now, they'll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress, with an option to request further information. \"The U.S. government is making enhancements to the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to provide additional transparency and process for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the No Fly List,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. In cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status, the government will provide a second, more detailed response, identifying \"specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the No Fly List,\" according to the court documents. An unclassified summary of that information will be provided \"to the extent feasible, consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake,\" court papers said. Those who appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing, with supporting materials or exhibits, and will receive a final written decision from the Transportation Security Administration. The 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge."

Hilarious: A lady bursts into laughter after spotting the 6ft homage to Mr Cumberbatch. Not amused: A shopper looks thoroughly unimpressed as she contemplates the artwork. Luckily for Cumberbatch, who usually enjoys a considerably more complimentary response to projects he's involved in, the piece will only be in residence temporarily. The 38-year-old actor, who is currently expecting his first child with wife Sophie Hunter, 37, isn't the only famous face to have found himself the subject of an edible artwork. . In the run up to the release of 50 Shades of Grey, bakers created not one but two 6ft gateaux paying homage to Jamie Dornan. One depicted the actor in the grey suit beloved of his 50 Shades character Christian Grey, while the other showed him topless and came complete with an edible six-pack. Award-winning: Both Jennifer Lawrence and her cake alter-ego have won awards. Homage: The cake, which triumphed at a show last November, was inspired by the Hunger Games . Actress Jennifer Lawrence has also been immortalised in cake, with baker Lara Clarke creating a sweet treat designed to resemble the 24-year-old's Hunger Games alter-ego, Katniss Everdeen. The confection, which was baked ahead of the release of Mockingjay Part One in November, met with the approval of Lawrence herself, who, when asked about it, said Ms Clarke was 'incredibly talented'. Other A-listers to get the culinary treatment include Kevin Bacon, whose likeness was made from bacon, and Taylor Swift who featured on a cake. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were turned into a tasty-looking pizza, while President Barack Obama had his likeness sculpted from butter. Immortalised: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been turned into pizza in the past. ribute: Kevin Bacon has a bacon sculpture to his name while Jamie Dornan has been made into a cake. "

                "A husband accused of trying to murder his cheating wife was ready to let her have sex with another man once a month as long as she stayed with him, his trial heard yesterday. A close friend told how Joseph O'Riordan, 74, had confided in him about the extraordinary plan for his 47-year-old wife Mandy. O'Riordan, a councillor and former nightclub owner, stabbed her eight times in a jealous rage after finding out she had been having an affair with a postman. . Extraordinary deal: Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times -yesterday Brighton Crown Court heard he was considering allowing her to have affairs. She suffered life-threatening injuries after being knifed in the torso, chest, arms and back. The jury was also shown dramatic footage of the moment police arrived at the couple's home to be greeted by a 'calm' O'Riordan opening the door. The revelation of his proposal for keeping his wife of ten years came from Alfred Harris. He told how O'Riordan had confided five days before the attack that he believed she was having an affair. O'Riordan was 'choked up and emotional' when he said: 'I think Amanda is playing away. She's getting her nails and hair done more regularly, she's been on a diet and doesn't want sex.'. Asking for a suit: O'Riordan sent his wife this letter from his prison cell. The following day, added Mr Harris, the men met for a pub lunch in O'Riordan's home village of Polegate, East Sussex. 'I saw Joe and he told me that Amanda had been seeing someone else -a guy who drove a van. Joe said he loved Amanda to bits and if she wanted to have sex with someone else once a month that would be okay as long as she stayed with him.'. In a statement read to Brighton Crown Court, Mr Harris also described the couple as 'loving and close'. . He was 'so shocked' to learn that O'Riordan had attacked his wife at their flat on a residential care home estate. The jury saw images of four police officers, one of whom was wearing a lapel camera, arriving shortly before 10pm last October 22 after racing to the scene. . PC Dave Catt said they drew their 'incapacitating' sprays fearing the knifeman would be still holding his weapon.  "

                "Article Washington (CNN)An Iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed U.S. Navy helicopter over the Persian Gulf this month, sparking concern that top Iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces, CNN has learned. The incident, which has not been publicly disclosed, troubled U.S. military officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident. It also surprised U.S. commanders because in recent months Iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner, one U.S. military official told CNN. \"We think this might have been locally ordered,\" the official said. The incident took place as the U.S. and other world powers meet with Iran in Switzerland to negotiate a deal limiting Tehran's nuclear program. At the same time, Iran has been active in supporting proxies in several hotspots in the Persian Gulf and neighboring regions. The Navy MH-60R armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the USS Carl Vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace, the official said. An unarmed Iranian observation Y-12 aircraft approached. The Iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter, coming within 50 yards, before the helicopter moved off, according to the official. The official said the helicopter deliberately broke off and flew away in a 'predictable' manner so the Iranians could not misinterpret any U.S. intentions. The Navy helicopter was in radio contact with the ship during the encounter, but there was no contact between the two aircraft and no shots were fired. The Navy crew took photos of the incident but the military is not releasing them. The U.S. administration is considering a potential demarche protest against Iran, the official said. CNN has reached out to Iranian officials but has not received a response. This type of Iranian observation aircraft generally operates over the Gulf several times a month. But after the recent incident, U.S. naval intelligence did not see it again for two weeks, leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was then reprimanded by higher-ups. The Pentagon has noted for the last several years that most encounters with the Iranian military at sea or in air are conducted professionally, but that some missions run by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces have been too aggressive against U.S. forces in the area. The U.S. military's concern has been that one of these incidents could escalate into a military encounter. This incident \"might have been buffoonery\" the official said, but there is always a risk from such actions. The incident comes as the Navy patrols the Gulf of Aden to watch for Iranian ships the U.S. believes are trying to bring weapons to resupply the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Navy would share such intelligence with Saudi Arabia, a second U.S. official told CNN."

                "Article synchronization of neural activity appears in different parts of the mammalian cerebral cortex @xcite , and underlies different neural processes in both normal and anomalous brain functions @xcite . it has been suggested that synchronization plays a vital role in information processing in the brain , e.g. , processing information from different sensory systems to form a coherent and unified perception of the external world @xcite . on the other hand , synchronization has been detected in pathological conditions such as parkinson s disease @xcite . and epileptic seizures have long been considered resulting from excessive synchronized brain activity @xcite , though some recent studies suggest that this picture may be an over -simplification @xcite . therefore understanding the mechanisms of synchronization may be a critical step in elucidating how neural systems work @xcite . it has stimulated a great deal of theoretical and numerical works , such as the studies on the effects of the topological properties of underlying networks @xcite and the dynamical properties of synaptic coupling @xcite . it was recently shown that the response time of synaptic couplings influences the stability of synchronized oscillation in the nonlocally coupled hodgkin -huxley ( hh ) equations @xcite . if the response time of synaptic coupling is slower , synchronized activity of the systems is instable for excitatory coupling . however , the underlying dynamical mechanism of the influence is not clear . in experimental studies @xcite , it has been suggested that the generation of prolonged epileptiform neuronal synchronization is favored by lower efficacy of synaptic transmission . the numerical studies @xcite in a detailed computational model revealed that seizure -like activity occurs when the excitatory synapses are weakened , and the results were confirmed experimentally in mouse neocortical slices . according to the common accepted assumption that synchronization of neuronal activity underlies seizures , the dynamical mechanism of synchronization may be useful for understanding the way the biological neural system works . in this work , we numerically investigated the dynamical mechanism underlying the influence of synaptic efficacy on firing synchronization in hh neuron networks . to do this , we first studied the dynamics of the response of hh neuron to excitatory synaptic current . when the efficacy of synapse is low , namely , strength is weak and duration is short , the limit cycle is stable to the perturbation of the synaptic current . when synaptic efficacy is high , synaptic current can induce the transition of the neurons from limit cycle to fixed point or transient state . the transition is determined by dynamics of neuron s ionic channel . the decrease of synaptic current depresses the feedback of sodium ionic current which is responsible for the initiation of the spike . for simplicity we will refer to the transitions as spike death . in neuronal networks , synaptic input of a neuron is the accumulation of the currents received from all presynaptic neurons . when the coherence of firing time of neurons is enhanced by the excitatory interaction , the synaptic input of neurons transforms from the fluctuating waveform into the pulse shape like the signal produced by one synapse . if synaptic efficacy is high , the input signal can induce spike death of the neuron . then spike death disorders the adjustment of the rhythm of neurons and prevents neurons from firing spikes synchronously . in contrast , for synapses of lower efficacy , the duration of synaptic current is too short to induce spike death of neurons . additionally , the firing synchronization is different from synchronous activity of oscillators for the existence of the transitions of neuron s state . the paper is organized as follows . the hh neuron model and the synaptic coupling were introduced in sec . the response of a hh neuron to synaptic current was investigated in sec . the influence of the dynamics of neurons on firing synchrony was shown in sec ."

Article for the understanding of surface reactions and the characterization of materials it is desirable to measure local forces close to a sample surface . the most common method to measure these surface forces is atomic force microscopy ( afm)@xcite . historically , the first force measurements were static measurements for which the force is presented as a scalar function of the static tipsample separation , the so -called force curve@xcite . this representation is sufficient for conservative forces but the total tipsurface force may also contain contributions from dissipative forces . since dissipative forces depend on probe velocity and past trajectory , dynamic force spectroscopy methods are required for their measurement . moreover , the visualization of dissipative forces as a function of position is valid only for a specific probe trajectory and simple force curves can not capture the full character of the interaction . despite the development of several dynamic methods@xcite surface forces are still usually treated as functions of the probe position only and represented by simple force curves . here , we present a comprehensive framework for the representation and analysis of complex surface forces as they are measured by dynamic afm . we concentrate on the most common modes of dynamic afm : amplitude -modulated afm ( am -afm ) and frequency -modulated afm ( fm -afm ) , which can be considered as narrow frequency band methods@xcite . we explore the fundamental limit of force reconstruction with narrow band dynamic afm at fixed probe height and show how minimal assumptions allow for a quantitative reconstruction of the tip -surface interaction . at the heart of the afm apparatus is a micro -cantilever with a sharp tip . the cantilever is firmly clamped at one end and the tip is located at the other end which can move freely . it is assumed that surface forces only act on the tip whereas the rest of the cantilever does not experience significant surface forces . in dynamic afm an additional external drive force is applied to maintain an oscillatory motion . thus , the dynamics are governed by the force between tip and surface , the external drive force and the properties of the cantilever beam . since the cantilever is a three dimensional continuum object its motion is usually described by the amplitudes of different oscillation eigenmodes . in general , these modes can cause the cantilever to bend in all directions in space . however , the cantilever is positioned such that the softest flexural modes bend the beam in a plane orthogonal to the surface plane . we restrict ourselves to the case where only these flexural modes are excited by the drive force . due to this experimental configuration the cantilever is much more susceptible to the component of the tipsurface force which is orthogonal to the surface plane . this component of the force is typically the most dominant component and the influence of lateral force components is considered negligible . in this case the cantilever acts as a mechanical projector which reacts only to one component of a three dimensional force vector field . the deflection @xmath0 of a cantilever of length @xmath1 orthogonal to surface is described by a one dimensional euler -bernoulli equation@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the young s modulus , @xmath4 is the second moment of area , @xmath5 is the mass per unit length of the cantilever , @xmath6 is the position coordinate along the cantilever beam and @xmath7 is the time variable . the force term @xmath8 includes the surface forces acting as a point -like load at position @xmath9 , the external drive force and the hydrodynamic damping due to the surrounding medium@xcite .",

                "Article Film director David Lynch has confirmed he will no longer direct the revival of \"Twin Peaks\" -a cult 1990s television show that was set to return in 2016. The offbeat TV series, created by Lynch and Mark Frost, featured a quirky FBI agent who went to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the mysterious murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The groundbreaking series is considered one of the most influential shows in television history. Lynch broke the news about his departure in a series of tweets, saying that the show's third season will continue without him. He said he felt the network was not offering enough money to produce the show \"the way it needed to be done.\" Lynch also wrote that he had personally called the actors over the weekend to let them know he would no longer be directing. Showtime Network, which will air the nine-episode comeback, released a statement saying they were \"saddened\" by Lynch's decision. \"We were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points,\" read the statement. \"Showtime also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm.\" Showtime announced they would produce a third season in October last year.

Article TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -Iran's parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change. Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran. \"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,\" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency. \"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.\" In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be \"unacceptable.\" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening. Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran \"will not change so simply\" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted. He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but \"you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],\" according to the news agency. Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office. \"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through,\" Obama said. \"But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won't be until January 20th.\" Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States. Ahmadinejad said Tehran \"welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts,\" according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday. Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran's nuclear program.   Article WASHINGTON (CNN) -The nation's largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, according to a new report. In 2007 President Bush visited the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies power to almost 9 million Americans, \"has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures,\" leaving them \"vulnerable to disruption,\" the Government Accountability Office found. Simply put, that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout. Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, fears the problem is much larger than just the TVA. \"If they are not secure, I don't have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure,\" he said. The TVA operates 52 nuclear, hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern United States. Among the government watchdog agency findings: \u2022 The TVA's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured \u2022 Passwords are not effective \u2022 Servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection \u2022 Intrusion-detection systems are not adequate \u2022 Some locations lack enough physical security around control systems. The GAO recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to Congress. In September, CNN first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment. The experiment, dubbed \"Aurora,\" caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system. The test was conducted by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory. In October, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. told Congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability, but Langevin said it now appears that Congress was misled. A congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem. \"It appears that they just made those numbers up,\" Langevin said. \"It is not acceptable. It is outrageous.\" He said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks. The electric reliability corporation -a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -told CNN it regrets the confusion. Experts told CNN that Cooper Industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the Aurora vulnerability. The company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide. It has sold just over 100, it told CNN. Langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps, and he will press to give those powers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The congressman is chairing an Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology subcommittee hearing Wednesday afternoon. Representatives of the TVA, the GAO, the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee. CTRLsum [Q: Are cyber attacks a real threat? A:]: Yes. Gold Answer: skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout.  "
