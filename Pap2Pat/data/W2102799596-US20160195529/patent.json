                "The present invention relates to methods for determining tuberculosis infection status and compositions and kits for use in such methods.",
                "Worldwide there are almost 2 million deaths due to active tuberculosis (TB) every year (World Health Organisation (WHO) 2011) and in the developed world, including the UK, rates of TB have risen (Health Protection Agency (HPA) 2011).",
                "Clinicians treating TB face two major challenges:\n\n\n- - 1) Diagnostic distinction of active TB and latent TB infection\n    (\u201cATB\u201d and \u201cLTBI\u201d, respectively)\n  - 2) Prioritising treatment of LTBI to those most likely to progress\n    to active TB.",
                "Unlike, for example HIV infection, where the amount of virus in the body (plasma or other compartments) is directly quantifiable using PCR, there is no comparable test to directly measure mycobacterial (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) pathogen load. A widely used TB diagnostic assay, the mantoux or tuberculin skin test (TST), uses an immune-based approach to demonstrate the presence of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The TST has poor specificity especially in those who are BCG-vaccinated (Diel, Goletti et al. 2011) and poor sensitivity especially in those who are immunocompromised e.g. with HIV infection (Cobelens, Egwaga et al. 2006).",
                "The recently introduced interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) also use an immune-based approach, which is more quantifiable than the mantoux test and less open to confounding by BCG vaccination or exposure to environmental mycobacteria. Neither the mantoux test nor the IGRAs nor indeed any other commercially available assay can reliably distinguish between latent, active or treated TB or predict which patients with LTBI are likely to progress to active TB.",
                "Approximately half of pulmonary TB cases are smear positive for acid fast bacilli (HPA 2011). This method for diagnosing active TB is therefore not very sensitive and is highly disease site specific. The gold standard diagnostic test for active TB is microbiological culture. This was only positive in 58% of cases reported in the UK in 2010 (HPA 2011) and is especially difficult to interpret in paucibacillary disease e.g. lymph node TB, central nervous system TB (CNS TB) and in HIV co-infection. This method of diagnosis is also confined to accessing the site of disease, which can be challenging. The new PCR based approaches e.g. GeneXpert, whilst quicker than microbiological culture cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Both CNS TB and TB with HIV co-infection are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis is therefore of paramount importance.",
                "Investigation of both active and latent TB infection may involve multiple invasive, time consuming and expensive tests such as CT with contrast, bronchoscopy, biopsy or PET scanning. A blood test that could reduce the need for such intensive investigation would therefore be of great benefit to both patients and healthcare providers.",
                "Treatment of active TB requires a longer, more complex and more toxic treatment regime than the chemoprophylaxis used for LTBI, however both can be associated with potentially life-threatening toxicity. Many therapeutics currently used to treat mycobacterial infection have high associated morbidity e.g. peripheral neuropathy and mortality e.g. liver necrosis. Therefore use of the appropriate shortest and most effective therapeutic regime is vital.",
                "Misdiagnosis of active TB as LTBI can lead to uncontrolled mycobacterial replication and increases the risk of drug resistance, which is more difficult to treat and has a higher associated morbidity and mortality. Misdiagnosis of LTBI and consequent treatment as active TB exposes patients to unnecessary and sometimes toxic therapies for a prolonged period. Furthermore, as most patients with LTBI will never progress to active TB, there is therefore an opportunity to improve care by identifying those most likely to progress and prioritising them to receive treatment. Those unlikely to progress would thus be able to avoid taking chemoprophylaxis altogether.",
                "Currently there is no diagnostic test able to distinguish these two groups. However, given that the likelihood of progression is greatest in the first 2-3 years following MTB infection, correlates of time since exposure may provide a means for risk stratification.",
                "Some data have shown that changes in the antigen-specific cellular immune response mirror pathogen burden and clearance e.g. in cytomegalovirus and HIV infections (Harari, Petitpierre et al. 2004). Recent work on the MTB-specific cellular immune response has suggested that this paradigm holds true in TB (Casey,",
                "Blumenkrantz et al.; Millington, Innes et al. 2007). Further studies have focused on using either MTB-specific cell function or cell phenotype to try to distinguish between active and latent infection (Harari, Rozot et al.; Goletti, Butera et al. 2006; Wang, Cao et al. 2010; Mueller, Detjen et al. 2008; Caccamo, Guggino et al. 2009).",
                "WO 2007/107714 describes the use of T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 secretion in assessing the outcome of infections such as TB. WO 2009/158521 describes using differential expression of a large number of genes for distinguishing between active and latent TB. Caccamo et al. (2010) Eur. J. Immunol 40: 2211-2220 describe the use of the T-cell subset that expresses TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 as correlating with active TB. Data in the wider literature on the correlation of multi-functional (and here specifically tri-functional) MTB-specific T-cell frequency with the presence of active TB is both limited and conflicting. WO 2011/044508 describes the use of differential expression of T-cell antigens in the evaluation of prognoses of patients suffering from chronic pulmonary diseases generally. WO 2012/085652 describes the use of CD4 positive T-cells in a method which is 66.67% sensitive and 92.41% specific in the differentiation between active and latent TB infection, based only on the percentage of those cells that produce TNF-\u03b1 but not IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2.",
                "To date, it has not been recognised that loss of CD127 expression can be used to discriminate a subset of differentiated effector T cells or showed clearly that the changes measured in active versus latent TB were independent of HIV co-infection. Therefore, none demonstrated an approach that was sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to be taken forward as a clinical diagnostic test or widely applicable to the HIV co-infected population. Furthermore, these tests were not evaluated with a view to risk stratification in LTBI. In addition, the results from, WO 2012/085652, were not fully replicable from our own data or in other studies comparing active and latent TB e.g. Caccamo et al. (2010) Eur. J. Immunol 40: 2211-2220.",
                "The inventors now combine simultaneous measurement of both cellular phenotype and function to give highly detailed data on the MTB-specific cellular immune response. They have shown for the first time, that when combined, MTB-specific cell phenotype and function are closely linked to TB disease stage e.g. active versus latent and that these changes are independent of HIV co-infection.",
                "The method described herein can distinguish between active and latent TB with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93% and on receiver operator characteristic analysis, the area under the curve of was 0.994 (the value for a perfect test being 1).",
                "Furthermore, this data suggests that, within LTBI, this combined measurement may be a clinically relevant approach to risk stratification by distinguishing individuals who have been recently versus remotely infected. This novel combined approach therefore provides the most accurate proxy of TB disease activity to date.",
                "The inventors now provide the most sensitive and specific immunological approach to date for distinction of active and latent infection and indication of mycobacterial disease activity based on the measurement of the phenotype (CD45RA-CCR7-CD127-) of a specific subset of CD4+ MTB-antigen responsive cells.",

                                "Our detailed interrogation of antigen-specific T-cell phenotype and function has delineated the association of TB disease stage with MTB-specific cellular immunity. ATB was associated with an increased frequency of mono- or dual-functional CD4+ and CD8+ MTB-specific T-cells that secrete IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF-\u03b1 making these subsets potential biomarkers of disease activity.",
                                "Simultaneous evaluation of memory phenotype of responding cells provided a more sensitive and specific surrogate than CD4+ functional profile alone. Expression of CD45RA, CCR7 and CD127 on MTB-specific T-cells secreting only IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 was lowest in those with ATB. Memory phenotype was not exclusively linked to the functional profile (except for IL-2-only cells which were mainly TCM) but was closely related to underlying TB stage. These markers might therefore serve as indicators of TB activation.",
                                "Combined measurement of both functional profile and differentiation phenotype provided a highly discriminatory immunological read-out for ATB and LTBI. In those with ATB, >17.3% of PPD-specific CD4+ TNF-\u03b1-only-secreting cells were CD45RA-CCR7-CD127- and this phenotype was therefore strongly associated with activated infection. Given that responses to PPD are less specific for MTB infection than responses to RD-1 antigens, this PPD-specific T cell signature may be used to distinguish TB from LTBI in the second step of a two-step diagnostic testing strategy, where MTB infection has been ruled-in at step one by a positive result in an RD-1-based immunodiagnostic test (e.g. IGRA).",
                                "Our data shows that the frequency of CD8+ MTB-specific cells, and therefore proportion of responders, was increased in ATB and this approach holds promise for the discrimination of TB disease stage especially in HIV co-infection where all participants had a positive response to MTB peptides. This association precludes the comparison of combined function and phenotype of MTB-specific CD8+ cells, however, because non-responders were by default mainly in the LTBI group. Measurement of CD8+ functional subsets in ATB and LTBI was therefore not sufficiently discriminatory for active and LTBI in our cohort.",
                                "In this study we included individuals with HIV co-infection to compare and distinguish the impact of ATB on MTB-specific cellular immunity with the impact of HIV co-infection. Where CD4+ MTB-specific effector-like cells were influenced by TB disease stage, the impact of HIV co-infection per se was rarely significantly associated with these changes. This may have been partially due to the inclusion of patients who were treated for HIV infection.",
                                "However, in the case of CD127, stratification by CD4 count showed that the stage of HIV disease influenced expression of this marker on MTB-specific T-cells. Reduced CD127 expression on HV-specific CD8+ T-cells (reviewed in Crawley et al. Immunol Cell Biol 2011 Aug 23. doi: 10.1038/icb.2011.66) and CD4+ T-cells (Dunham R M, et al. J Immunol 2008; 180:5582-92) is observed with HIV disease progression, but a relationship between HIV disease progression and CD127 expression on MTB-specific T-cells has not previously been noted. Our finding indicates that in HIV co-infection, MTB-antigen-specific CD4+ cells lose CD127 expression with advancing HIV disease and are therefore potentially more differentiated. This effect could be directly virus-induced or secondary to increasing subclinical mycobacterial burden with advancing HIV infection.",
                                "Our cohort included individuals with both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infection. HIV infection is more commonly associated with TB dissemination as evidenced by the widespread involvement in some of these individuals. Despite some variation in clinical phenotype of those with ATB, our biomarker reliably distinguished TB stage, regardless of site of disease, suggesting that it may remain robust across the clinical TB disease spectrum and therefore have wide applicability. No individuals with LTBI developed ATB during 12 months of follow-up suggesting that, in our cohort (recruited in a TB non-endemic area), subclinical TB was not present in those classified as LTBI. The lack of continuous exogenous priming or re-stimulation due to TB exposure distinguishes our cohort from others recruited from TB endemic areas and removes this is as a possible confounding effect on the immunological changes we observed.",
