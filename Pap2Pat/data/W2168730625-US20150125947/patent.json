                "The invention relates to a microfluidic device and a microfluidic system comprising one or more microfluidic devices. More particularly, the invention relates to microfluidic devices for performing operations on microdroplets flowing in channels of microfluidic systems. In particular, the invention relates to geometries of microfluidic devices that enable i) trapping a droplet in a fixed position, ii) dispensing predetermined droplet volume from a larger volume delivered to a channel, iii) merging two or more microdroplets flowing in a channel, iv) changing distances between droplets flowing in a channel. The present invention comprises also microfluidic systems employing such microfluidic devices to perform complex hydraulic operations on sample volumes. For example, the integration of a few microfluidic devices according to the present invention allows for generation of a sequence of sample dilutions with a buffer to yield sample concentrations decreasing in geometric series in consecutive droplets. In another example, the integration of devices according to the invention allows for generation of a sequence of droplets with predetermined dilution profile and for confinement of these droplets in strictly defined locations in a microfluidic cartridge. Particularly preferably, the systems according to the present invention can be effectively used for assessment of the results of chemical and biochemical reactions performed on small samples of solutions or body fluids. The systems according to the present invention can also be used to perform time- and cost-effective microbiological studies.",
                "A growing number of reports relating to the use of microfluidic systems in chemistry allow to predict rapid development of the lab-on-a-chip technology, consisting in performing experiments and operations on microvolume samples, in near future. Especially promising is the use of droplets generated in microchannels as miniaturised chemical reactors, because of their small volume, ranging from microliters, through nanoliters down to picoliters. Typically, droplet-based microsystems comprise a multiplicity of microfluidic channels, with their inlets and outlets, interconnecting within the microfluidic chip, where droplets of solutions surrounded by immiscible continuous phase are generated. Further, the droplets inside the systems can be merged, transported along the channels while their contents are being mixed, stored under constant or varying conditions, and finally sorted or split in channel junctions and retrieved from the microfluidic system. The use of microlaboratories to conduct chemical and biochemical reactions inside microdroplets offers the following advantages [H. Song, D. L. Chen and R. F. Ismagilov, Ang. Chem. Int. Ed., 45, 2006, 7336-7356]: i) no dispersion of time of residence for fluid elements in a channel, ii) rapid mixing, iii) ability to control easily the kinetics of reactions, iv) ability to conduct multiple reactions in parallel, v) low consumption of reagents. These characteristics make the microdroplet-based microsystems a potentially valuable tool for analytical chemistry, synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology. The existing reports on the use of droplet-based microfluidic systems for compartmentalization of chemical reactions include applications in chemical synthesis [A. Griffiths et al., Compartmentalised combinatorial chemistry by microfluidic control, US patent application US20060078893], and in biochemical reactions [A. Hsieh et al., Method and apparatus for rapid nucleic acid analysis, US patent application US20080166720].",
                "One of the challenges related to droplet-based microsystems is to enable i) preparation of each of the micro-mixtures contained in droplets so that they are individually addressable, i.e., that the collection of reagent concentrations in each micro-mixture could be individually settable, ii) conducting long-term monitoring of the progress of reaction or incubation of microorganisms inside the droplet, iii) localisation of droplets at well-defined locations in a microfluidic cartridge, iv) performing iterative titration and replacement of a part of the volume in a predetermined, individually addressable microvolume, and v) performing any combination of the above operations using possibly a simple set of devices supplying the cartridge with flows, in preferred embodiments so that no precise control with external devices is needed to obtain precisely dispensed volumes and precisely predetermined combinations of concentrations of chemical or biologically active agents.",
                "In the state of the art there are robotic stations conducting reactions inside well plates that operate on reaction mixture volumes in the range of single microliters or more, with frequencies in the range of tenths of a Hertz, or less. Likewise, robotic stations conducting reactions inside cells offer reaction volumes ranging from a few tens to a few hundred microliters and the rate of generation of reaction mixtures of tenths of a Hertz. In both techniques, the accuracy of dispensing the volumes of solutions reaches the level of a few percent or better. These techniques require, however, the use of technically complex fluid supply systems and fluid volume dispensing systems.",
                "In the state of the art there are solutions related to generation of microdroplets on demand inside microfluidic systems. M. Unger et al. (Science, 288, 2000, 113-116) constructed a valve comprising two perpendicularly aligned\u2014one above the other\u2014microchannels fabricated in an elastomer. Application of pressure to one of them results in deformation of both channels and closes the lumen of the second channel. This solution is very popular in the microfluidic techniques, with numerous modifications presented, i.a., by S. Hulme et al. (Lab Chip, 9, 2009, 79-86), S. Zeng et al. (Lab Chip, 9, 2009, 1340-1343), and J. Galas et al. (N. J. Phys, 11, 2009, 075027). W. Grover et al. (Sensors Actuators, B 89, 2003, 315-323) presented another popular microvalve. It is a membrane valve controlled by applying a pressure or a vacuum on one side of the membrane resulting in deflection thereof and closure or opening of the lumen of the channel. Churski et al. (Lab Chip, 10, 2010, 512-518, Polish patent application P-388565) demonstrated a modified Grover valve completely fabricated in a stiff material, comprising elastic membrane only.",
                "There are examples reporting the use of external valves for generation of droplets on demand inside a microfluidic system. For example, Churski et al. (Lab Chip, 10, 2010, 816-818, and the Polish patent applications P-390250, P-390251, international patent application PCT/PL2011/050002, published under the number WO 2011 090396 A1, and so far unpublished Polish patent application P-393619) have shown a system using an external valve of a large dead volume, modified with a capillary of appropriate stiffness and hydrodynamic resistance large enough to enable dispensing droplets with volumes in the range of nanoliters with no risk of flooding the microfluidic system by excessive solution.",
                "All the above cited demonstrations do not allow for performing a number of operations on droplets without precise active control over the flow. Such an opportunity is offered by solutions taking advantage of channel geometry and Laplace pressure (related to the surface tension on and the curvature of the surface of a microdroplet). In general, these solutions make use of differences in pressures needed to push continuous fluid that wets the walls of the channels and to push a droplet of a liquid that do not wet the walls of the channels through diverse channel cross-sections. Generally, side intrusions in the lumen of the channel can be used to make the flow of the continuous liquid relatively easier while simultaneously hindering the flow of droplets of the liquid that does not wet the walls of the channels.",
                "In the state of the art there are solutions that take advantage of the cited effects related to the surface tension.",
                "For example, [Niu et al., Lab Chip, 8, 2008, 1837; Guo et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 97, 2010, 233701] report on devices comprising a chamber with bypasses (i.e., side channels) on both sides of the chamber. Each bypass comprises a number of inlets and outlets along the chamber. The inlets and outlets are formed by short sections of microfluidic channels of a depth such as the main channel, and a width smaller than the main channel. In the cited solution, the width of the main channel in the chamber can be decreasing along the direction of the flow of the liquid. Droplets smaller than the volume of the chamber, of a diameter greater than the width of the chamber, are stopped in the chamber. Subsequent droplet flowing into the chamber merges with the preceding droplet, and if their total volume is greater than the volume of the chamber, the mixture is released. Similar solutions have been reported also elsewhere [Chung et al., Microfluid. Nanofluid., 9, 2010, 1151-1163]. A disadvantage of these solutions is the lack of precision in positioning the first locked droplet. As a result, incoming droplets of virtually different volumes can merge in the trapping device and release the mixture. For simplicity, microfluidic devices discussed here are hereinafter referred to as, traps\u201d. In addition, the mixture released from the trap chamber flows out through a significantly widened section of the main channel. This allows for the continuous fluid to flow around the droplet being released, and consequently, for a low efficiency of pushing out the mixture from the trap. Slowing down the outflow of the mixture is unsuitable as far as the system throughput and the risk of merging the mixture with subsequent droplet flowing into the trap are concerned. In special case, a droplet just outgoing from the trap can be catch up by the next droplet in sequence. For this device, the size of the outgoing droplet depends not only on the geometry, but also on the frequency of the droplets incoming in a sequence. In addition, the traps presented in the references cited above are not symmetric with respect to the change of the direction of flow through the main channel. Such a design prevents from using a trap so constructed in integrated microfluidic chips employing flow reversal in the protocol of operations on microdroplets. All the above limitations are eliminated in a trap designed according to present invention.",
                "Another report [Zagnoni et al., Lab on a Chip, 10, 2010, 3069] describes a device comprising a chamber with bypasses facilitating continuous phase flow and hindering the flow of microdroplets. The bypasses comprise side intrusions in the lumen of the channel, and extend down to the full depth of the main channel. The device stops a queue of N microdroplets in the chamber. Only after the N+1 droplet arrives to the chamber, the first droplet in the queue is being released from the chamber. So, the number of droplets in the chamber remains constant. The trap does not allow for stopping only a single droplet (the trap stops the entire queue of droplets adjoining to each other). A disadvantage of this solution is that it requires the droplets to touch to each other, which may be undesirable in many applications. In addition, the design cited above requires that the entire chamber is filled with droplets. Like in the previous case, the design is not symmetric with respect to the change of the direction of flow through the main channel. Such a design prevents from using a trap so constructed in integrated microfluidic chips employing flow reversal in the protocol of operations on microdroplets. The present patent application discloses solution that eliminates these problems by introducing a bypass running in parallel to the chamber with a single, appropriately shaped inlet and with a single, appropriately shaped outlet at the entrance and the exit of the chamber, respectively.",
                "The paper by Niu et al. [Niu et al., Nature Chemistry, 3, 2011, 437] reports on a device comprising a chamber trapping a droplet of predetermined volume. The chamber comprises a bypass with a number of inlets formed by short sections of microchannels of a depth identical with that of the main channel, and a width smaller than the main channel. The chamber comprises also an outlet of a depth identical with that of the main channel and the chamber, and a width smaller than the main channel and similar to the width of inlets to the bypass. The device allows for titration of solution contained in a droplet by adding subsequent droplets (of a volume smaller than that of the droplet in the trap) to the droplet locked in the trap. After merging, a portion of the droplet locked in the trap is pushed out through the outlet of the chamber into the main channel, and a portion of fluid is detached from it. Sequential addition of droplets with concentration of analytes different than the initial concentration of these analytes in the droplet locked inside the trap allows for releasing droplets with varying concentration of said analytes. A disadvantage of the solution cited above is that it does not determine precisely the volume of the droplet locked in the trap. Because of the shape of the chamber, the shape and volume of the droplet locked therein may essentially depend on the flow rate of the continuous phase and its viscosity. The cited solution does not allow for titration of a trapped droplet with droplets of a wide volume range. In addition, the design cited here is not symmetric with respect to the change of the direction of flow through the main channel. Such a design prevents from using a trap so constructed in the integrated microfluidic chips employing flow reversal in the protocol of operations on microdroplets. The present patent application discloses solution that eliminates these problems by introducing a bypass running in parallel to the chamber with an appropriately shaped connection between the bypass and the main channel, for example in the form of a narrow gap between the \u201cceiling\u201d (i.e., the upper internal surface) of the main channel and the \u201cfloor\u201d (i.e., the lower internal surface) of the bypass. The design disclosed in the present application allows for introducing at the entrance, at the exit, or both at the entrance and at the exit, of a narrowing of the lumen of the main channel in the form of a barrier of a height equal to the height of the walls under the bypass slit.",
                "[Bai et al., Lab on a Chip, 10, 2010, 1281] report on trap chambers forming an array of traps in a wide channel. A lumen of the channel is left between the traps to allow for the flow of both the continuous phase and the droplets. Each trap is made of walls forming a chamber that is open from one side only. Additionally, the walls of the chamber comprise narrow gaps allowing for flow of the continuous phase through the trap. Flow reversal allows for washing out the droplets from the traps and guiding them to other traps. Appropriate flow handling allows for locking two different droplets in a trap. Similar solution has been also reported by [Xu et al., Lab on a Chip, 12, 2012, 725]. A disadvantage of these solutions is that the droplets can flow around the traps and are trapped only by chance. This makes impossible to track the droplets precisely and to identify them by assigning them to a given, strictly specified trap. In solutions disclosed in the present application, the droplets flow through channels that pass through the traps. The droplets flowing through the channel enter the trap in a predetermined sequence which enables unambiguous droplet identification. In addition, such traps can be used to construct a device that generates an array of trapped droplets and allows for controlling of the content of each single droplet in time.",
                "The papers [Du et al., Lab Chip, 9, 2009, 2286-2292; Li et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 132, 2010, 112-119; Li et al., Langmuir, 26, 2010, 12465-12471; Pompano et al., Langmuir, 28, 2012, 1931-1941] report on solutions comprising geometrical control over the volume of droplets. These solutions prevent from merging droplets of different volumes by pulling channels and chambers containing the droplets on each other. A disadvantage of the solution is that components of a microfluidic chip must be shifted against each other, which leads to problems with keeping the chip tight and introduces additional mechanical requirements. The solutions according to the present invention eliminate these problems, while enabling similar operations on fluid microdroplets. [Tan et al., Lab on a Chip, 4, 2004, 292; Tan et al., Microlfuid. Nanofluid., 3, 2007, 495; Liu et al., Microfluid. Nanofluid., 3, 2007, 239-243; Bremond et al., PRL 100, 2008, 024501] report on a component of microfluidic system comprising a channel section significantly wider than the width of the inlet and the outlet channel. Such a design results in slowing down the flow in the widened part and in approaching subsequent droplets to each other in the direction of flow, allowing for merging the droplets. A disadvantage of the solution is a limited maximum distance between the droplets that are to be merged in a so designed system. In particular, such a system does not stop a droplet so that it could wait for an arbitrarily long time until another droplet to be merged with the stopped one arrives. The solution according to the present invention allows for stopping droplets that are shorter than the trap length for any arbitrarily selected time period, and allows for merging droplets spaced by any distance. In addition, the solution according to the present invention allows for determining the volume range of droplets to be merged.",
                "The solutions [Ahn et al., Lab Chip, 11, 2011, 3956; Lee et al., Microfluid. Nanofluid., 11, 2011, 685-693] present devices comprising two parallel channels interconnected by cross channels spaced at equal distances. After travelling a certain distance, droplets moving in parallel channels synchronise with each other, i.e., they form droplet pairs moving with the same speed one under the other, even if they were introduced into the system at different times. This solution allows for merging droplets from two unsynchronised droplet generators. A disadvantage of these solutions is that they are geometrically complex and do not allow for stopping a droplet for an arbitrarily long time in order to merge it with another droplet. The devices according to the present invention eliminate these problems by offering the same, and even broader range of operations on microdroplets.",
                "The solution presented by [Takinoue et al., Small, 6, 2010, 2374-2377] allows for stopping a droplet of a well-defined volume in a chamber formed by a blind channel section departing from the main channel. This solution allows also for titration of solution contained in a locked droplet by adding smaller droplets that are merged with the trapped droplet by applying an oscillating electric field. After merging, a portion of the droplet locked in the trap is pushed into the main channel and releases a droplet of a volume similar to that added earlier to the trapped droplet. A drawback of this solution is that it is difficult to precisely control the fluid exchange in the trapped droplet. Because the location, at which the droplet is merged with a fresh droplet arriving through the main channel, is geometrically close to that one, where, after the merging referred to above, a droplet for the main channel is formed, the solutions added to and taken from the locked droplet can be mixed in a poorly controlled way. The solution according to the present invention eliminates the problem by allowing for any shape of the chamber and for any location of inlet and outlet channels. In particular, it is preferable to geometrically separate the locations at which the droplets merge with and detach from the droplet locked in the trap.",
                "[Dangla et al., PRL 107, 2011, 124501] reported a mechanism of droplet anchoring in a microchannel. In the channel of a width much greater that the height they made a well of an area insignificant as compared with the \u201cfloor\u201d surface area of the main channel. A portion of a droplet flowing through the channel squeezes in the hole, thus creating a capillary energy barrier, which locks the droplet. Unfortunately, the solution does not allow for precise operations on droplets, in particular, it is not possible to precisely control the volume of a so locked droplet.",
                "[Sun et al., Lab Chip, 11, 2011, 3949] presented a system comprising an array of traps interconnected with a main channel. Each trap has a form of a circle with a diameter greater than the width of the main channel. The trap entrance is wide (as the width of the main channel), and the trap outlet is narrow. Such design allows the continuous phase to flow through the trap and the droplet to flow into the trap. The trap can also be circumvented through a bypass, which has the same cross-sectional size as the main channel. When a large drop moves through the system, droplets formed by the detachment of the volume portions of the large drop get locked in the circular traps. When a droplet containing another analyte is introduced into the system containing locked droplets, then as the droplet moves through the system, the analyte is mixed with droplets in traps in a concentration that is different for each trap. A disadvantage of the solution is that the droplet passing through the trap must be larger than the droplet in the trap. This imposes a limitation for the range of droplet sizes that can be handled with the trap. The solution according to the present invention does not have this disadvantage, and allows for merging droplets locked in traps with droplets of any volume (both larger and smaller than the chamber volume).",
                "Another limitation of the solution [Sun et al., Lab Chip, 11, 2011, 3949] is complexity of the mechanism of material exchange (fluids/solutions) between moving droplet and droplets locked in traps. The exchange of analytes between the moving drop and the droplets locked in traps can take place by convection (laminar and turbulent whirls) and by diffusion. Due to complexity of the process and the dependence of the rate of the exchange of mass on the flow rate, the viscosity of fluids and the diffusion constants of analytes, it is difficult to precisely control the extent of the exchange of mass between the droplets. This difficulty results in the lack of precise control over the analyte concentrations in droplets locked in traps. In the solution according to the present invention, a droplet merging with the droplet locked in the trap fuses entirely with the locked droplet, and the exchange of mass is precisely determined. Moreover, the solution [Sun et al., Lab Chip, 11, 2011, 3949] uses a channel geometry that is not symmetric with respect to the change of the direction of flow of the liquid. Devices according to the present invention allow for designing both the microfluidic systems dedicated to transporting fluids in one direction only, and the systems allowing for conducting complicated protocols of operations on droplets with reversed direction of flow. In particular, the traps according to the present invention allow for precise metering of a predetermined volume of liquid, and subsequently, for washing away that volume of liquid to subsequent traps, where the fluids are merged and mixed in strictly predetermined proportions.",
                "[Takahashi et al., Microfluid. Nanofluid., 9, 2010, 945-953] reported microfluidic device comprising a capillary trap that stops droplets and passes the continuous liquid through a narrow gap placed in the side plane of the main channel. The trap is composed of two neighbouring and adjoining channels, one of which being shallower than another. Both channels are blind at one terminus. The device allows for stopping, colliding and merging droplets in a trap. It does not allow for controlled pushing of merged droplets further to perform subsequent operations on the resulting mixture.",

                                "Those skilled in the art will easily understand that specific dimensions, shapes and geometries of the disclosed metering trap are typical only, and do not exhaust many design possibilities, as long as these are consistent with the present invention. In particular, the cross-section of the microfluidic channel can have transverse dimensions from single micrometers to single millimetres and not necessarily must be square\u2014channels with rectangular or other cross-sections, e.g., oval or circular ones, are possible. The same relates to side channels, whereas their depth can be greater, equal to or smaller than the depth of the microfluidic channel, but preferably it represents not more than 90% of the depth of the microfluidic channel. In a very preferred embodiment there are two side channels, running symmetrically and of identical depth. Asymmetrical embodiments are, however, also possible, e.g., ones comprising two side channels of different depths, each of which meets the conditions mentioned above, two side channels of different lengths and identical or non-identical depth, or comprising one side channel only. Side channel or channels must always terminate or start at the barrier, and more generally at the obstruction. The shape of the obstruction 4a (looking from above) not necessarily must be semicircular\u2014it can be also oval, polygonal, flat or irregular, while symmetrical or asymmetrical at the same time. The length of the barrier (as measured along the direction of flow) can be from 1/10 to several widths of the main channel and is limited by practical considerations only. In particular, small width of the channel can put a limitation on the maximum flow rate of the continuous liquid, at which the device operates correctly, i.e. stops a droplet in the trap. Finally, the plastic the trap is to be fabricated of can be selected from a wide range of plastics used for fabrication of microfluidic devices, whereas such plastics are well known to those skilled in the art. In particular, a trap according to the invention can be fabricated of glass, ceramic materials, metals, or a broad range of polymers, including chemically and thermally hardened materials.",
                                "An important, permissible modification of the trap according to the invention relies on the possibility of changing the width and/or depth of the section of the microfluidic channel that adjoins to the side channel. In particular, that section of the microfluidic channel can be wider than the parts of the microfluidic channel, which do not adjoin to the side channel, and additionally, the width can vary (while shifting in the direction of flow). Also the envelope of the side walls of the microfluidic channel, when looking from above, must not be essentially a straight line (as illustrated in FIG. 1), but can be another curve (e.g. a section of a circle or ellipse).",
                                "The metering trap shown in FIG. 1 operates so that it stops (traps) droplets moving forward through the trap. The trap has its predetermined volume (hereinafter referred to as the trap volume), equal to the volume of the largest droplet that could be locked in the trap. The volume is somewhat smaller than the volume of the channel between the entrance and the exit of the side channels.",
                                "If the trap contains a continuous liquid only, and a droplet of a volume equal to or smaller than the trap volume flows into the trap (during the forward flow), then the droplet is locked in the trap. The process is illustrated in FIG. 2, where in FIG. 2a and FIG. 2b the solid arrow indicates the speed of the droplet flowing into the trap, and the dashed arrows indicate the flow of the continuous liquid. After reversing the flow, the droplet locked earlier in the trap is released from the unidirectional trap (FIG. 2c).",
                                "When a droplet 4 flowing (forward) into the unidirectional metering trap has a volume larger than the trap volume, then such droplet 4 flows through the trap until its rear aligns with the entrance to the trap. At that moment, the continuous liquid starts to flow through the side channels 5, the droplet stops to flow forward, and the inflow of the continuous liquid over the barrier 4a results in the detachment of a portion of the droplet that is located behind the barrier 4a (in the direction of flow). As a result, the trap locks a droplet 4 of trap volume, and the excess liquid 15 in the original droplet 4 is released and passes through the trap. FIG. 3 shows a sequence of micrographs illustrating the series of events described above, where x is the direction of flow and y is time.",
                                "If a metering trap contains an earlier locked droplet 4 of a volume equal to the trap volume, then, irrespective of the length of the incoming subsequent droplet, the same droplet volume (equal to the trap volume) will remain in the trap, and the volume of the droplet liquid that will be released from the trap will be the same as that which entered the trap. Thus, the passing of a droplet results in a partial or entire replacement of the analyte inside the trap, but does not change its amount. When the length of the droplet is much larger than the length of the trap, the material inside the trap is entirely replaced.",
                                "Depending on the analytes, the droplet 4 arriving at the trap can either merge with the droplet 4 that was already locked in the trap, or push out the droplet locked earlier (or a portion thereof) without merging. When the droplets merge, a droplet is obtained at the trap exit that is equally as long as the one which entered the trap (FIG. 4a), where x is the direction of flow and y is time. When the droplets do not merge and the length of the droplet entering the trap is greater than the trap length, then a sequence of two droplets is obtained at the trap exit, whereas the first of these droplets has a volume of the trap, and the second one has a volume equal to the difference between the volume of the entering droplet and the trap volume (FIG. 4b), where x is the direction of flow and y is time.",
                                "In a similar embodiment of the invention a bidirectional trap is obtained. The bidirectional variant of the metering trap is shown in FIG. 5, in a top view (main drawing), and in sections along the AB line (bottom drawing) and along the CD line (drawing on the right) lines. Compared with the trap shown in FIG. 1, the version presented in FIG. 5 comprises additional second barrier 4a in the microfluidic channel 1, identical with the first barrier and located at a distance of 0.4 mm to a few millimetres therefrom (as measured along the direction of flow). The side channels of identical depth of 100 \u03bcm, running symmetrically with respect to the microfluidic channel 1, are from 0.4 mm to several millimetres long and start at the first barrier 4a and terminate at the second barrier 4a. Each side channel is connected with the microfluidic channel 1 through the inlet 7 of the side channel 5 and the outlet 8 of the side channel 5, and connected with the obstruction 4a, whereas the lumen of the inlet 7 of the side channel 5 and the outlet 8 of the side channel 5 is reduced as compared with the lumen of the side channel at a place located between its inlet 7 and outlet 8, preferably by minimum 50%, and more preferably from 66% to 75%. \u201cReduction of the lumen\u201d shall mean the reduction of the surface area of the channel's cross-section. In particular, it can be achieved by narrowing or shallowing of the side channel 5 in the area of inlet 7 and outlet 8 of the side channel. Reduction of the lumen of the bypass 5 at its inlet 7 and outlet 8 to the main channel 1 is necessary for correct trap operation. As a result, there is a barrier preventing the droplet locked in the trap from entering the bypasses. This is a prerequisite for an efficient separation of the flow of the continuous phase through the side channels from the flow of the droplet phase through the main channel.",
                                "Also in this case, all modifications of the trap design, as described with reference to FIG. 1, in the section \u201cPossible trap modifications\u201d, are permissible. The distance between the first and the second barrier 4a can be adjusted as needed, and the first and the second barrier need not be equally deep.",
                                "The operation of the bidirectional trap is the same as that of the unidirectional one described earlier. The difference between the unidirectional and the bidirectional traps appears when the direction of flow is reversed. Due to the fact that the bidirectional trap is symmetric, its operation is the same irrespective of the direction of flow. Hence, the trap has the same effect on droplets flowing through it as the unidirectional trap described earlier, no matter what direction the droplets are coming from. For the unidirectional trap, the droplets flowing upstream are neither stopped nor metered in the trap\u2014they flow freely through the trap. The droplets generated earlier in the unidirectional trap are washed out from the trap once the flow is reversed. For the bidirectional trap, the locked droplet is not washed out from the trap after the flow is reversed.

The structure of the merging trap differs only by the obstruction used in this trap: instead of the barrier 4a, a side intrusion 4b is used here. The side intrusion has been produced by fabricating an additional channel in the barrier 4a, parallel to the main channel passing through the centre of the barrier. The channel increases the lumen for the flow of a droplet through the obstruction. The result of the modification is that the deformation of droplet in the area of the side intrusion is not large enough to lead to cutting of the droplet, as presented in earlier examples where the barrier 4a was used instead of the side intrusion 4b.",

The continuous phase flows around the droplet 4 through the side channels, whereby the force exerted by the flow on the rear of the droplet 4 is too low to push it through the side intrusion (FIG. 7b).",

Therefore, the force exerted by the flow on the rear of the droplet is sufficient to push the front of the droplet 4 through the side intrusion 4b. Unlike the metering trap described above, the side intrusion 4b causes smaller droplet deformation than the barrier 4a. Consequently, when a droplet enters the trap, it is not broken at the side intrusion 4b, and the entire droplet 4 goes out of the trap (FIG. 7a).",

In particular, when a series of droplets smaller than the trap volume moves toward the merging trap, subsequent droplets will merge in the trap until their total volume exceeds that of the trap. Thus, at the trap exit, a series of identical droplets of a volume larger than that of the trap is obtained.",

In the case of a bidirectional metering trap, a droplet, once trapped, is locked in the trap, even if the direction of flow varies.",

This allows the continuous phase to flow into the side channels 5 at the exit of the trap only, and to flow out at the exit of the trap only.",

The first droplet stops at the trap, as is the case for the traps from Examples 1 and 2. The second droplet entering the trap, though, causes the continuous phase to flow through the main channel 1. The continuous phase, blocked by the droplet entering the trap and the baffles, must press against the droplet locked earlier in the trap, leading to the pushing of the droplet through the barrier or side intrusion. The droplet that has arrived, replaces the preceding droplet and is locked until the next droplet arrives.",

A droplet is released from the trap as a result of a subsequent droplet approaching the trap. Locking a droplet for a certain period of time at a specific place is advantageous, particularly when single droplets are to be measurement. Especially advantageous is the mechanism wherein a droplet is directly released from the trap, thus preventing droplets from sticking together.",

In this case, when the baffles 6 separating the droplet 17 from the side channels 5 are not used, the shape of such droplet 17 would be unstable and the droplet liquid would be pushed into the side channels 5. The use of baffles 6 allows for correct operation of such a device, which is illustrated in FIG. 12: a)\u2014droplet 4 approaches the trap filled with droplet phase 17; b)\u2014droplet 4 flowing into the trap contacts the locked droplet 17, which results in merging of both droplets; c)\u2014in line with absorption of the incoming droplet 4 by the droplet in the trap 17, the same volume of droplet liquid 21 is released at the other terminus of the trap; d)\u2014after absorption of the entire incoming droplet 4 at one terminus of the trap, a droplet of identical volume 21 is released at the other terminus of the trap (compare a) and b), droplets 4 and 21).

In this case the trap is filled with the active ingredient that forms therein a droplet 21 of a volume predetermined by the geometry of the trap. When a series of solvent droplets 4 of a volume smaller than the trap volume is guided to a so filled trap, then, as a result, the trap releases a sequence of droplets 25 of a size identical with that of droplets 4 entering the trap, but with a decreasing concentration of the active ingredient.",

The added volume from the new droplet moves forward and arrives at the entrance of the trap causing generation at the trap exit of a droplet of the same volume as the droplet entering the trap (FIG. 14). The process of droplet absorption by the trap and the simultaneous release of a new droplet is too fast to allow for the solvent from the droplet entering at the front of the trap to be mixed in the entire trap. The droplet entering the trap has, therefore, no effect on the concentration of the droplet released at the terminus of the trap. Thus, the concentration of the released droplet is the same as that before the solvent droplet arrives at the trap. After adding the solvent droplet to the trap, the solvent volume from the added droplet mixes with the solution of the active ingredient in the trap, resulting in decreasing concentration of that ingredient in the trap.

In a loop having one branch with high resistance, but large and symmetric cross section at the junction, and the other branch having low resistance, but a narrow inlet at the junction to this branch, the competition between these two laws determines the direction of flow for the droplet.",
                                "Thus, it should be possible to fabricate a loop where droplets choose to flow via the branch with higher resistance. Moreover, using a simple design it should also be possible to pre-determine different paths for droplets depending upon the direction of flow.",

The operation of such a \u201cone-way router\u201d relies on the different shape (cross section) of the two branches at the junctions 12.",
                                "The cross section of the inlet 2 and outlet 3 channels are constant/uniform (for example, w=h=400 \u03bcm). From the inlet junction 14, the height of one of the branches is preserved along its length half way to the next junction (exit junction), then it gradually decreases from h to h/4 at the point where it joins the exit junction (and outlet channel), which has the height h. The loop is anti-symmetric, meaning that in the opposite direction the other branch 10, at the outlet junction 16, has the same geometry. As a result, at either junction 12, the inflowing droplet has to choose between a branch 10 of cross section w\u00d7h and a branch 10 of cross section w\u00d7(h/4). Although resistance in the loop from the inlet 2 to the outlet 3 is the same via both branches 10, in the derailed loop, droplets, in order to minimize their Laplace pressure, always chose the branch with the largest cross section at the junction 12. Moreover, even when the resistance in the \u201cdriving branch\u201d increases due to the increasing number of inflowing droplets, it is still more convenient for the droplets to choose that branch than to undergo large deformation of their shape.",
                                "Unlike in a classic loop with uniform height, where droplets 4 flow into one and the other branch 10 in turns, as shown in FIG. 23, top row, in the de-railed loop droplets 4 always flow in one branch 10 for a given direction of flow and then when the direction of flow is reversed always flow trough the other branch to, as shown in FIG. 23, bottom row.",

This enables fabrication of derailing loops using methods involving only single layer planar designs, such as standard soft lithography.",
                                "Various loops and networks can be fabricated, as shown in FIG. 24, using non-uniform geometry to drive the droplets on in a pre-determined path, and then, by simply changing the direction of the flow, to redirect (\u201cderail\u201d) them to another track (analogously to the railways).
