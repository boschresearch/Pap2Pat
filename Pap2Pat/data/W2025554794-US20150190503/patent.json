    "abstract": "Redox-active NPs are disclosed that can potentiate innate immunity and stimulate distinct adaptive responses, producing distinct T cell subset polarization outcomes. Nanomaterials that can alter the cellular redox environment through ROS modulation can impact human immunology. TiO2 nanoparticles potentiate DC maturation, inducing the secretion of IL-12, p70, and IL-1B, while treatment with CeO2 nanoparticles induces IL-10, a hallmark of suppression. When delivered to T cells, the materials direct distinct TH polarization, where TiO2 stimulates largely a TH1 dominated response, whereas CeO2 stimulates a TH2 bias and TReg differentiation.",

                        "Nanoparticles (NPs), particles sized between \u02dc1 and \u02dc200 nanometers, are now a ubiquitous aspect of modern life. For example, titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs are common additives to many consumer products, from food to paint to cosmetics (Weir et al. (2012) Environ. Sci. Technol., 46, 2242-50). However, questions remain as to how these materials affect human physiology. For example, some metallic NPs have been reported to induce acute toxicity in pulmonary and renal tissues (Fan & Alexeeff (2010) J. Nanosci. Nanotechnol. 10, 8646-57). Similar to foreign substances captured within the bloodstream or mucosa, NPs are likely to encounter a parallel fate, when, for example ingested or inhaled, where they will ultimately interact with the immune system. On the other hand, cerium oxide (CeO2) NPs have shown promise in protecting tissues from oxidative stress and have been proposed for alleviating damage to surrounding healthy tissue following cancer radiation therapy (Patil et al. (2007) Biomaterials, 28, 4600-7; Colon et al. (2010) Nanomedicine 6, 698-705; Hirst et al. (2009) Small 5, 2848-56).",
                        "Testing of NPs can include many complexities. For example, testing NPs via oral exposure is multifaceted due to differences in diet, mucus secretion and composition, pH, gastrointestinal transit time, and even gastrointestinal flora comprising factors that can influence NP uptake (Fr\u00f6hlich & Roblegg (2012) Toxicology, 291, 10-17). Active uptake mechanisms of NPs into cells have been studied. They include macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and caveolae-mediated and non-clathrin, non-caveolae-mediated uptake. The latter can be subdivided into RhoA- (or IL-2R\u03b2-) dependent endocytosis, Cdc42/Arf1 or clathrin-independent cargo/glycophosphatidyl-inositol (GPI)-anchored protein enriched compartment-dependent (GEEC) endocytosis, Arf6-dependent endocytosis, and flotillin-dependent endocytosis (Fr\u00f6hlich & Roblegg (2012) Toxicology, 291, 10-17).",
                        "There is growing interest in understanding how NPs might interact with cells of the immune system, given observations that immune cells act to eliminate or interact with NPs in the bloodstream (Dobrovolskaia et al. (2008) Mol. Pharm. 5, 487-95). Adding to this interest is the fact that nanoparticles have many different and tunable physicochemical properties, including size, shape, chemical composition, solubility, and surface chemistry that can influence their interaction with the immune system. There is the potential for NPs to have specific physiological effects on the cells of the immune system. The present invention is directed to aspects of the interactions between NPs and cells of the immune system, and other important goals."

                                "Upon exposure to an antigenic stimulus, the immune system reacts, in part, through differentiation of na\u00efve TH cells into two broad subsets of T helper cells, TH1 and TH2 cells, characterized by differences in cytokine production. T helper-1 (TH1) cells produce IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF-\u03b2 and they are typically involved in cell-mediated immune responses that are beneficial in host defenses against intracellular pathogens and malignant cells, but detrimental in mediating autoimmunity. TH1 cells also activate macrophages and elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. TH1 responses are generally associated with anti-viral and anti-cancer immune reactions. TH1 cells are also important for defending against infections with intracellular microbes.",
                                "TH2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13, which augment antibody responses, including IgE production, and protect against helminth infestations, but also cause allergy and asthma. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 are important for IgE production and suppress cell-mediated immunity. TH2 responses are effective for clearing parasitic infections, such as the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni that causes schistosomiasis in humans, and are identified by high secretion of IL-4 and IL-13. A TH2 cell predominance has been found in the skin of patients with chronic graft-versus host disease, progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and allergic diseases.",
                                "TH1 and TH2 responses are mutually antagonistic. They normally exist in equilibrium and cross-regulate each other to some degree. TH1 and TH2 cytokines oppose each other's function and typically exist in a balanced state. The cytokines produced by each cell subset act as their own autocrine growth factors but cross-regulate the other subset's development and function. This model of cross-regulation has been used to explain a number of in vivo immune phenomena.",
                                "An altered balance between TH1 and TH2 cytokines is thought to underlie the etiopathogenesis of many immune-mediated diseases. Indeed, the balance between TH1 and TH2 subsets determines susceptibility to malignant, infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases. For example, allergic inflammation is typically characterized by a TH2 cell cytokine-like response, with overexpression of TH2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-25, and under-expression of TH1 cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3. Also, evidence from animal models suggests that TH1-type lymphokines are involved in the genesis of organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune uveitis, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Administration of TH1 (e.g., IL-12) or TH2 (e.g., IL-4) cytokines in vivo, thus can promote or inhibit autoimmunity. However, direct administration of cytokines to treat an autoimmune disease may not be feasible in the clinical setting because of the short half-life of the cytokines in vivo.",
                                "The TH1/TH2 paradigm, with its differentiated TH subsets balancing each other, offers the possibility of interfering with diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, by affecting the balance. Several studies have reported that an imbalance in TH1/TH2 responses may impact the pathogenesis of pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., Druet et al. (1995) J. Exp. Immunol. 101 (suppl. 1), 9-12). Multiple control pathways of TH1 and TH2 cell development are now known, and understanding the dynamics and complexity of the in vivo regulation processes is advancing. Further, the notion that TH1 and TH2 responses are themselves controlled by another type of T cell, regulatory T cells or TRegs, offers other opportunities for immunotherapeutic intervention in autoimmune and allergic conditions.",
                                "Various strategies have been proposed to modulate the TH1/TH2 balance (e.g., Dumont (2002) Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 12, 341-367). They include procedures that affect the differentiation of TH1 and TH2 cells, the production of effector cytokines, and the activities of the cytokines.",
                                "Specific means for modulating the TH1/TH2 balance are provided herein. Such means are based on the use of redox-active NPs to modulate immune responses and elements thereof by inducing production of distinct T cell subsets, such as TH1 and TH2 cells, and cytokines produced by such cells. Redox-active NPs are those NPs that possess reduction/oxidation (redox) activity. Most metal oxide particles have no redox potential. Because of the high difference in redox potential between oxidation states, most metal oxide particles are not redox-active at normal temperatures and pressures. However, for example, cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles (nanoceria) have redox activity because redox cycles between the Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states allow them to react catalytically with, for example, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (Celardo et al. (2011) Nanoscale 3, 1411-20). Because of the coexistence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ on the surface of CeO2 nanoparticles, they are redox-active; as a result of the low redox potential between Ce3+ and Ce4+ (1.7 eV), they can switch back and forth. As shown herein, cerium oxide nanoparticles have catalytic activity and antioxidant properties in tissue culture and animal models. As further shown herein, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles also exhibit excellent properties.",
                                "As stated above, and described in detail below, the present invention is directed to redox-active NPs that can modulate immune responses, and to methods of using such NPs in the production of distinct T cell subset polarization. CeO2 NPs were found to induce DCs to produce IL-10 and, when co-cultured with T cells, induced TH2 cytokine production. Such responses are beneficial in adjuvants for vaccines targeting humoral immunity. TiO2 NPs were found to induce DCs to produce IL-12 and stimulate a TH1-polarized T cell response. Such responses are beneficial in adjuvants for vaccines relying on cellular immunity, such as cancer vaccines. CeO2 NPs were also found to stimulate DCs to produce IL-10, making CeO2 NPs useful in promoting TReg responses. Such responses are beneficial in treating autoimmune diseases and cancer. These redox-active NPs can modulate immune responses, producing distinct T cell subset polarization outcomes, likely due to their contrasting activity (TiO2 NPs=oxidant; CeO2 NPs=antioxidant).",
                                "The data provided herein demonstrate that surface reactivity can profoundly influence immune responses and directionality. Specifically, the data suggest that low doses of redox-active NPs can modulate the activation status of human DCs and alter the direction of CD4+ T helper cells in response to challenge. The data illustrate the capacity for NPs to influence TH polarization in a distinct manner, influenced by parameters such as size, and therefore exposed surface area. NPs will be useful in driving a T cell-biased response in the direction necessary for prophylaxis and will also be useful, when conjugated to an antigen of interest, to stimulate and/or sustain a desired immune response to the antigen.",
                                "CeO2 NPs will be useful for therapeutic vaccines and autoimmune and inflammatory disease prophylaxis, considering the importance of TH2 responses for driving antibody production, a defining feature of prophylactic vaccination, coupled with the observation that CeO2 NPs can aggregate (perhaps via intracellular DC transit) in lymph nodes (Cassee et al. (2011) Crit. Rev. Toxicol., 41, 213-29). In this context, modulation of these redox reactions by sustained CeO2 NP treatment will also provide a therapeutic benefit, in the induction of TRegs, in controlling inflammatory-mediated diseases.",
                                "**Characteristics of the Nanoparticles**",
                                "The nanoparticles of the present invention are nanoparticles of TiO2 and CeO2. The NPs can be obtained from sources such as titanium isopropoxide or cerium nitrate hexahydrate, for example. Alternatively, the NPs can be produce according to the procedures provided in the Examples below.",
                                "When used in the methods and formulations of the present invention, at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of the CeO2 NPs have an average diameter of between about 1 nm and 200 nm. The average diameter may also be between about 1 nm and 50 nm, between about 1 nm and 20 nm, between about 1 nm and 15 nm, between about 1 nm and 10 nm, between about 2 nm and 6 nm, or between about 3 nm and 5 nm, but is not limited to these specific ranges. In a particular embodiment, at least about 90% of the CeO2 NPs have an average diameter of between about 3 nm and 5 nm.",
                                "Similarly, when used in the methods and formulations of the present invention, at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of the TiO2 NPs have an average diameter of between about 1 nm and 200 nm. The average diameter may also be between about 1 nm and 50 nm, between about 3 nm and 20 nm, between about 5 nm and 15 nm, between about 6 nm and 12 nm, or between about 7 nm and 10 nm, but is not limited to these specific ranges. In a particular embodiment, at least about 90% of the TiO2 NPs have an average diameter of between about 7 nm and 10 nm.",
                                "**Formulations Comprising Nanoparticles**",
                                "When administered to a subject, the nanoparticles may be provided in a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the nanoparticles and a carrier. Examples of suitable carriers are well known to those skilled in the art and include water, water-for-injection, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, propylene glycol, polysorbate 80 (Tween-80\u2122), poly(ethylene)glycol 300 and 400 (PEG 300 and 400), PEGylated castor oil (e.g. Cremophor EL), poloxamer 407 and 188, hydrophilic and hydrophobic carriers, and combinations thereof. Hydrophobic carriers include, for example, fat emulsions, lipids, PEGylated phospholipids, polymer matrices, biocompatible polymers, lipospheres, vesicles, particles, and liposomes. The terms specifically exclude cell culture medium. The formulations may further comprise stabilizing agents, buffers, antioxidants and preservatives, tonicity agents, bulking agents, emulsifiers, suspending or viscosity agents, inert diluents, fillers, and combinations thereof.",
                                "The identity of the carrier(s) will also depend on the means used to administer pharmaceutical formulations comprising NPs to a subject. For example, pharmaceutical formulations for intramuscular preparations can be prepared where the carrier is water-for-injection, 0.9% saline, or 5% glucose solution. Similar carriers may be used for intravenous preparations. Pharmaceutical formulations may also be prepared as liquid or powdered atomized dispersions for delivery by inhalation. Such dispersion typically contain carriers common for atomized or aerosolized dispersions, such as buffered saline and/or other compounds well known to those of skill in the art. The delivery of the pharmaceutical formulations via inhalation has the effect of rapidly dispersing the NPs to a large area of mucosal tissues as well as quick absorption by the blood for circulation. One example of a method of preparing an atomized dispersion is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,344, entitled, \u201cPowdered Pharmaceutical Formulations Having Improved Dispersibility,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
                                "Additionally, the pharmaceutical formulations may also be administered in a liquid form. The liquid can be for oral dosage, for ophthalmic or nasal dosage as drops, or for use as an enema or douche. When the pharmaceutical formulation is formulated as a liquid, the liquid can be either a solution or a suspension of the NPs. There is a variety of suitable formulations for the solution or suspension of the NPs that are well known to those of skill in the art, depending on the intended use thereof. Liquid formulations for oral administration prepared in water or other aqueous vehicles may contain various suspending agents such as methylcellulose, alginates, tragacanth, pectin, kelgin, carrageenan, acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinyl alcohol. The liquid formulations may also include solutions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs containing, together with the active compound(s), wetting agents, sweeteners, and coloring and flavoring agents.",
                                "The pharmaceutical formulations may also comprise encapsulated NPs. Encapsulation facilitates access to the site of action and allows the administration of other active ingredients simultaneously.",

                                "The NPs and pharmaceutical formulations comprising NPs may be administered to a subject via means that include, but are not limited to, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intraocular, rectal, transdermal, mucosal, pulmonary, topical and parenteral administration. Parenteral modes of administration include without limitation, intradermal, subcutaneous (s.c., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), and intra-arterial. Any known device useful for parenteral injection or infusion of drug formulations can be used to effect such administration. Means for administering nanoparticles to a subject via intraperitoneal, intravenous, oral, and subcutaneous routes are well known in the art (see., e.g., Hirst et al. (2011) Environ. Toxicol. [Epub ahead of print]; Umbreit et al. (2012) J. Appl. Toxicol. 32, 350-7; Patri et al. (2009) J. Appl. Toxicol. 29, 662-72).",

                                "The nanoparticles of the present invention are administered to a subject in an amount sufficient to induce a particular effect or in a therapeutically effective amount. Thus, individual or unit doses of the nanoparticles are administered to a subject to achieve the disclosed goals.",
                                "The individual or unit doses administered to a subject may be in a pharmaceutical formulation comprising the nanoparticles. The concentration of nanoparticles in an individual or unit dose administered to a subject when practicing the methods of the invention lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The concentration may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration used. Generally, a concentration sufficient to induce a particular effect or a therapeutically effective amount will vary with the subject's age, condition, and gender, as well as the severity of the medical condition of the subject. The dosage may be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.",

The specific volume may vary based on the concentration of nanoparticles in the formulation.",
                                "Administration frequencies of the individual or unit doses will vary based on factors such as the purpose for the administration, the method being practiced, the volume to be administered and the concentration of the formulation, among other factors. Acceptable frequencies include 4\u00d7, 3\u00d7, 2\u00d7 or once daily, every other day, every third day, every fourth day, every fifth day, every sixth day, once weekly, every eight days, every nine days, every ten days, bi-weekly, monthly and bi-monthly. Depending on the means of administration, the pharmaceutical formulations may be administered all at once, such as with an oral formulation in a capsule or liquid, or slowly over a period of time, such as with an intramuscular or intravenous administration.",
                                "The duration over which the methods of the present invention will continue to be practiced will be best determined by the attending physician. However, the methods may continue to be practiced for days, week, months or even years.",
                                "A therapeutically effective amount and an amount sufficient to achieve a particular stated goal can be measured by the therapeutic effectiveness of the compound. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the NPs being used. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount and an amount sufficient to achieve a stated goal is sufficient to establish a pre-selected maximal plasma concentration. Preliminary doses as, for example, determined according to animal tests, and the scaling of dosages for human administration is performed according to art-accepted practices.",
                                "Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferable.",
                                "Data obtained from the cell culture assays or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. Therapeutically effective dosages achieved in one animal model may be converted for use in another animal, including humans, using conversion factors known in the art (see, e.g., Freireich et al., Cancer Chemother. Reports 50, 219-244 (1966) and Table 1 for equivalent surface area dosage factors).",

The immunostimulation provided by a surface active agent may also be accomplished by either developing a fusion protein with non-active portions of the cholera toxin, exotoxin A, or the heat labile toxin from E. coli. Immunomodulation through the use of anti-IL-17, anti IFN-\u03b3, anti-IL-12, IL-2, IL-10, or IL-4 may also be used to promote a strong Th2 or antibody mediated response to the vaccine formulation.",

A stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide was added as an oxidizer, resulting immediately in the formation of cerium oxide NPs. NP powder was obtained by washing the precipitate of CeO2 NPs several times with acetone and water to remove the surfactant used in the synthesis process. The solution was aged further to allow the slow reduction of surface cerium from the 4+ oxidation state to the 3+ oxidation state in acidic medium by maintaining the pH of the suspension below 3.5 with nitric acid."

(2006) Biomaterials, 27, 5199-211), the effects of NPs on DCs were investigated because they are pivotal in both innate and adaptive immunity, being solely capable of activating na\u00efve CD4+ helper T cells, a key support cell for inducing humoral and cellular immunity and long-lived memory.",

No increased cell death or apoptosis was observed in DCs exposed to CeO2 NPs for 24 h, while DCs treated with TiO2 NPs for the same time period had an appreciable increase in the number of apoptotic and dead cells, in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 2A). Higher doses (100 \u03bcM) of TiO2 induced increased cell death and apoptosis, compared with CeO2 NP-treated DCs (FIG. 2). While the findings on TiO2 NPs cytotoxicity in human DCs are consistent with previous work and the observations of others using cell lines (Schanen et al. (2009) ACS Nano, 3, 2523-32; Xu et al.

(2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 19449-54). As part of the innate response, DCs undergo a maturation process, which may be broadly qualified by two classic physiological features: increased expression of surface costimulatory and MHC molecules (CD80, CD86, HLA-DR) and changes in chemokine receptor expression (CCR7).",
                                "DCs treated with as little as 1 \u03bcM TiO2 NPs induced expression of CD80 and CD86 and increased the expression of HLA-DR, comparable to the level induced by the positive control, LPS. On the other hand, FIG. 2B shows upregulation of CD83, a phenotypic hallmark of DC maturation, only at a higher TiO2 dose (100 \u03bcM).",

In concert with the observed costimulatory marker upregulation, it was demonstrated that exposure to TiO2 NPs, but not CeO2 NPs, induced increased expression of CCR7 (FIG. 2B). CCR7 expression is significant because of its role in DC migration towards lymph nodes where antigen presentation occurs; thus, materials that upregulate CCR7 expression may enhance immunity.",

Thus, the impact TiO2 and CeO2 NPs on DC cytokine secretion was studied. DCs were incubated in the presence or absence of a range of CeO2 or TiO2 NPs for 24 h followed by quantification of key cytokine levels in culture supernatants (FIG. 2C).",
                                "DCs treated with TiO2 NPs increased their production of IL-12, p70 and TNF-\u03b1, while CeO2 NPs enhanced IL-10 cytokine secretion (FIG. 2C). The proinflammatory cytokine production observed following TiO2 NP exposure was consistent with the mature phenotype demonstrated in FIG. 2B. The opposite surface chemistry, low porosity, and decreased surface area are among the physicochemical features that differ between the CeO2 and TiO2 NPs and that may contribute to the impact profile of CeO2 NPs on innate immunity. Similar to this finding (FIG. 2B) are studies where antioxidants (reductive molecules) were shown to increase IL-10 production (Chauveau et al. (2005) Blood, 106, 1694-702; Wang et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem., 270, 9558-63), which can be an immunosuppressant (Chen et al. (2007) J. Immunol., 179, 6009-15).",

ICP-MS were used to examine the presence of metals within the treated DCs because this methodology has the sensitivity to detect NPs within the single-digit part-per-billion range (FIG. 3). It was determined that uptake was dose-dependent and detectable by ICP-MS at 50 \u03bcM for both NPs, leading to the conclusion that the difference between the NP surface chemistries had no influence on the frequency of uptake.",

(1998) Am. J. Physiol., 274, L81-6; Teste et al. (2011) Lab Chip, 11, 4207-13). Similarly, CeO2 uptake has only been demonstrated with higher dosing than that used in the present work (Zhu et al.

Intracellular oxidative stress was analyzed using the DCF-DA dye, which fluoresces on contact with ROS. FIG. 4 shows that TiO2 NPs induced human DCs to generate higher levels of ROS, comparable to H2O2, a positive control used to induce detectable ROS levels in culture.",
                                "In contrast, CeO2 NP-treated DCs showed little or no production of ROS (FIG. 4). Furthermore, these findings are consistent with work suggesting that CeO2 NPs have antioxidant properties capable of mitigating ROS production, as demonstrated by reduced ROS levels observed in DCs pre-treated with CeO2 and then incubated with H2O2 (FIG. 4B).",
                                "While ROS acts through a variety of downstream pathways to regulate/potentiate immune reactions, perhaps its most important feature is the ability to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a notable NLR family member that works to rapidly mobilize immune responses to cognate danger signals.",
                                "Because IL-1\u03b2 has been used routinely as a readout of inflammasome activation (Yazdi et al. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 19449-54), whether TiO2 NPs could activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in human DCs was examined via IL-1\u03b2 detection (FIG. 4C). Indeed, it was found that TiO2 NP-treated DCs did secrete IL-1\u03b2, consistent with prior studies demonstrating that TiO2 NPs activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in mice (Yazdi et al. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 19449-54). A selective NLRP3 inhibitor, glybenclamide (50 \u03bcM) (Lamkanfi et al. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 20574-81), was used in tandem with TiO2 NPs to determine whether TiO2 NPs could act through other NLR inflammasome members resulting in IL-1\u03b2 secretion. It was found that when TiO2 NPs and glybenclamide were co-administered, IL-1\u03b2 production was abolished (FIG. 4D). In contrast to the activation of NLRP3 by TiO2NPs, it was observed that CeO2 NPs were unable to instigate IL-1\u03b2 production.",
                                "On the basis that TiO2NPs were capable of upregulating CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, and CCR7 in combination with increased ROS generation, concomitant with NLRP3 activation, TiO2 NPs are thought to potentiate human DC activation, while CeO2 NPs do not engage DCs to upregulate surface receptors, but do have a stimulatory effect on DCs, to generate IL-10 and potentially mitigate oxidative stress.",

Isolated CD4+ T cells labeled with CFSE (proliferation detection dye) were used to monitor proliferative responses to the NPs. On their own, TiO2 NPs had a modest effect on lymphoproliferation.",
                                "The effects of NPs on T cells when co-administered with strong mitogens/nonspecific stimulators of T cells (PHA/PMA) were examined. When NPs were co-administered with PHA/PMA, TiO2 NPs amplified the proliferative response while CeO2 NPs moderately reduced the proliferative response (FIG. 5A).",
                                "Considering the innate responses induced by CeO2 NPs, the influence CeO2 NPs on the induction of regulatory T cells (TReg) was next investigated, as determined by staining for Foxp3, a specific marker of TRegs (FIG. 5B). While the capacity for NPs to induce TRegs has recently been shown (Park et al. (2011) Mol. Pharm., 8, 143-52), this was observed using PLGA NPs decorated with leukemia inhibitory factor.",
                                "Here, the capacity of naked CeO2 NPs to induce TRegs differentiation was demonstrated. Additionally, because the expression of CD95 in resting T cells has been shown to increase under stress or in disease conditions, modulation of this receptor, which has implications in co-stimulatory and effector function (Paulsen et al. (2011) 18, 619-31), was examined. FIG. 5C shows that there is a strong correlation for reduced CD95 expression in CeO2 NP-treated Th cells, compared with the mitogen control or TiO2 NP treatment.",
                                "To further understand the impact these NPs have towards adaptive immunity, the influence of both NPs on effector T cell responses in an allogeneic stimulation assay was investigated. Here, DCs were left untouched (iDC), matured with cytokine cocktail (mDC), or primed with either NP and transferred to allogeneic purified T cell cultures. The matured DCs were added as an activated DC control for comparison. Two additional groups were prepared for the above conditions where the co-culture was incubated with additional NP or NP+PHA to identify whether the persistence of NPs or NP+PHA in the co-culture had a cumulative effect.",
                                "Although the CeO2 NP-treated DCs had little influence on allogeneic naive CD4+ T cell proliferation, TiO2 NP-treated DCs boosted the magnitude of the proliferative response (FIG. 6). As well, it was observed that both particles triggered cytokine responses, but the profiles were nearly opposite: TiO2 NPs-pulsed DCs triggered a pro-inflammatory TH1-biased cytokine response (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3) while DCs pulsed with CeO2 NPs induced a naive T cell response dominated by TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) that are predominately anti-inflammatory and promote humoral-skewed responses. Beyond their capacity to participate in the induction of a TH2-biased T cell response, the CeO2 NPs were even capable of eliciting the production of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 in T cell co-cultures stimulated with a strongly TH1-biasing mitogen (FIG. 7). While it might have been anticipated that a well-described pro-inflammatory particle like TiO2 could drive a type 1 immune response, the response profile induced by CeO2 NPs, including IL-10 secretion by DCs (FIG. 2) and TH2 polarization (FIGS. 6 and 7), suggest a unique functional property of metallic antioxidant NPs that has not previously been described.",
                                "While NP-induced TH polarization has been observed by other groups (Conway et al. (2001) Vaccine, 19, 1940-50; He et al. (2000) Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol., 7, 899-903; Liu et al. (2009) Biomaterials, 30, 3934-45; Lutsiak et al. (2006) J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 58, 739-47), these results differed greatly from previous observations in that catalytic NPs were investigated using primary human T cells, revealing differential effects between redox materials, specifically that CeO2 NPs drive strongly towards a TH2 polarization program.",
                                "Cumulatively, the observed absence of toxicity in the effective dose range, IL-10 secretion by DCs (FIG. 2C), upregulation of TRegs, modulation of T cell proliferation, and TH2 polarization (FIG. 5-7) suggest unique functional properties of CeO2 NPs that may useful across a wide range of NP therapeutic applications.",
