    "title": "Personalized Machine Translation: Predicting Translational Preferences",
    "date": "2015-01-01",
    "abstract": "Machine Translation (MT) has advanced in recent years to produce better translations for clients\u2019 specific domains, and sophisticated tools allow professional translators to obtain translations according to their prior edits. We suggest that MT should be further personalized to the end-user level \u2010 the receiver or the author of the text \u2010 as done in other applications. As a step in that direction, we propose a method based on a recommender systems approach where the user\u2019s preferred translation is predicted based on preferences of similar users. In our experiments, this method outperforms a set of non-personalized methods, suggesting that user preference information can be employed to provide better-suited translations for each user.",

                "Technologies are increasingly personalized, accommodating their behavior for each user. Such personalization is done through user modeling where the goal is to \"get to know\" the user. To that end, personalization is based on users' attributes, such as demographics (gender, age etc.), personalities, and preferences. For example, in Information Retrieval, results are customized according to the user's information and search history (Speretta and Gauch, 2005), performance of Automatic Speech Recognition substantially improves when adapted to a specific speaker (Neumeyer et al., 1995), and Targeted Advertising makes use of the user's location and prior purchases (K\u00f6lmel and Alexakis, 2002).",
                "Personalization in machine translation has a somewhat different nature. Providers of MT tools and services offer means to \"customize\" or \"personalize\" the translation engine for each client, mostly through domain adaptation techniques, and a great deal of effort is made to make the human-involved translation process more efficient (see Section 2.2). Most of the focus, though, goes to customization for companies or professional translators. We argue that Personalized Machine Translation (PMT below) should and can take the next step and directly address individual end-users.",
                "The difficulty to objectively determine whether one (automatic) translation is better than another has been repeatedly revealed in the MT literature. Our conjecture is that one reason is individual preferences, to which we refer as Translational Preferences (TP). TP come into play both when the alternative translations are all correct, and when each of them is wrong in a different way. In the former case, a preference may be a stylistic choice, and in the latter, a matter of comprehension or a selection of the least intolerable error in one's opinion. For instance, one user may prefer shorter sentences than others; she may favor a more formal style, while another would rather have it casual. A user could be fine with some reordering errors but be more picky concerning punctuations. One user will not be bothered if some words are left untranslated (perhaps because the source language belongs to the same language family as the target language that he speaks), while another will find it utterly displeasing. Such differences may be the result of the type of translation system being employed (e.g. syntax-vs. phrased-based), the specific training data or many other factors. On the user's side, a preference may be attributed, for example, to her mother tongue, her age or her personality.",
                "Two aspects of end-user PMT may be considered: (i) Personalized translation of texts written by a specific user, and (ii) PMT to provide better translations for a specific reader. In this work we address the second task, aiming to identify translations each user is more likely to prefer.1 Specifically, we consider a setting where at least two MT systems are available, and the goal is to predict which of the translation systems the user would choose, assuming we have no knowledge about her preference between them. Benchmarking the systems in advance with respect to a reference set, or estimating the quality of the translations (Specia et al., 2009) are viable alternatives for translation selection; these, however, are not personalized to the target user. Instead, we employ a user-user Collaborative Filtering approach, common in Recommender Systems, which we map to the TP prediction task.",
                "We assess this approach using a collection of user rankings of MT systems from a shared translation task (see Section 3). Our results show that the personalized method modestly, but consistently, outperforms several other approaches that rank the systems in general, disregarding the specific user. We consider this as an indication that user feedback can be employed towards a more personalized approach to machine translation."

                        "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a common approach employed by recommender systems for suggesting to users items, such as books or movies. A recommender system may simply suggest to all users the most popular items; often, however, the recommendations are personalized for each individual user to fit her taste or preferences. User-user CF relies on community preferences. The idea is to recommend to the user items that are liked by users similar to her, as manifested, for example, by high rating. Similar users are those that agree with the current user on previously-rated items. In k-nearest-neighbors CF, a user is typically represented by a vector of her preferences, where each entry of the vector is, e.g., a rating of a movie. k similar users are then identified by measuring the similarity between the users' vectors. Cosine similarity is a popular function for that purpose, and we also use it in our work (Resnick et al., 1994;Sarwar et al., 2001;Ricci et al., 2011). An alternative to cosine, Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson, 1895), allows addressing different rating patterns across users. In comparison to cosine, here vector entries are normalized with respect to the user's average rating. In our case, such normalization is not very meaningful since the entries of the users vectors represent comparisons rather than absolute ratings, as will be made clear in Section 4. Nevertheless, we have experimented with Pearson correlation as well, and found no advantage in using it instead of cosine."

                        "Various means of customization and personalization are available, in both academic and commercial MT. Many of them target the company, rather than the individual user, and much of the effort is invested in designing tools for professional translators, aiming to improve their productivity, through intelligent Computer Aided Translation (CAT). Domain adaptation methods are commonly used to adapt to the topic, the genre and even the style of the translated material. Using the company's own corpora is one of the simplest techniques to do so, but many more approaches have been proposed, including dataselection (Axelrod et al., 2011;Gasc\u00f3 et al., 2012;Mirkin and Besacier, 2014), mixture models (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) and table fill-up (Bisazza et al., 2011). Clients can utilize their own glossaries (Federico et al., 2014), corpora (parallel or monolingual) and translation memories (TM), either shared or private ones (Caskey and Maskey, 2014;Federico et al., 2014). Through Adaptive and Interactive MT (Nepveu et al., 2004), the system learns from the translator's edits, in order to avoid repeating errors that have already been corrected. Post-editions can continuously be added to the translator's TM or be used as additional training material, for tighter adaptation to the domain of interest, through batch or incremental training."

                        "Many tasks that require annotation by humans are affected by the annotator and not only by the item being judged. Metrics for inter-rater reliability or interannotator agreement, such as Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960), help measuring the extent to which annotators disagree. Disagreement may be due to untrained or inattentive annotators, a result of a task that is not well defined, or when there is no obvious \"truth\". Such is the case with the evaluation of translation quality -it is not always straightforward to tell whether one translation is better than another. A single sentence can be translated in multiple correct ways. The decision becomes even harder when the translations are automatically produced and are imperfect: Is one error worse than another? The answer is in the eye of the beholder. MT papers regularly report rather low Kappa levels, even when measured on simpler tasks, such as short segments (Mach\u00e1\u010dek and Bojar, 2015). Turchi et al. (2013) refer to the issue of \"subjectivity\" of human annotators. They address the task of binary classification of \"good\" vs. \"bad\" translations, and show that relying on human annotation for training a binary quality estimator is less effective than using automatically-generated labels. This subjectivity is exactly what we are after. We treat it as a preference, trying to identify the systems or specific translations which the user subjectively prefers. Kichhoff et al. (2012) analyze user preferences with respect to MT errors. They show that some types, e.g. word order errors, are the most dis-preferred by users, and that this is a more important factor than the number of errors. While very relevant for our research, their analysis is aggregated over all users participating in the study, and is not focusing on individuals' preferences."

For each source sentence, a judge was presented with the source sentence itself, a reference translation, and the outputs of five machine translation systems. The five systems were randomly selected from the pool of participating systems, and were anonymized and randomly-ordered when presented to the judge. The judge had to rank the translations, with ties allowed (i.e. two system can receive the same ranking). Hence, each annotation point provided with 10 pairwise rankings between systems. Translations of 10 language pairs were assessed, with 11 to 19 systems for each pair. In total, over 900K non-tied pairwise rankings were collected. The Turkers' annotation included a control task for quality assurance, rejecting Turkers failing more than 50% of the control points. The inter-annotator score showed on average a fair to moderate level of agreement."

Given two systems (or models of the same system) we wish to predict which one the user would prefer, without assuming the user has ever expressed her preference between these two specific systems. It is important to emphasize that the method presented here considers the users' overall preferences of systems, and does not regard the specific sentence that is being translated.

This method predicts TP better than a set of non-personalized methods. The gain is modest in absolute numbers, but the results are highly statistically significant and stable over parameter values. We consider this work as a step towards more personalized MT. This line of research can be extended in multiple ways. First and foremost, as mentioned, we did not consider the actual content of the sentences, but rather identified a general preference for one system over another. It is plausible, however, that one system is better -from the user's perspective -at translating one type of text, while another is preferred for other texts. Taking the actual texts into account seems therefore es-sential. Content-based methods for recommender systems may be useful for this purpose. Another factor that may be affecting preferences is translation quality: when compared translations are all poor, preferences play a less significant role. Hence, it may be informative to assess TP prediction separately across different levels of translation quality.",
                "Large parallel corpora are typically required for training reasonable statistical translation models. Yet, parallel corpora, and even more so in-domain ones, are hard to gather. It is virtually impossible to find a user-specific parallel corpus, and methods for monolingual domain adaptation are easier to envisage if one wishes to address author-aware PMT (the first PMT task mentioned in Section 1). Collecting user feedback is another challenge, especially since most endusers do not speak the source language. For that and other reasons, it currently seems more feasible to collect preference information from professional translators, explicitly or implicitly.Yet, in this research we aim at end-users rather than translators whose preferences are often driven by the ease of correction more than anything else. We believe that one way to tackle this issue is to exploit other kinds of feedback, from which we can infer user preferences and similarity. Online MT providers are recently collecting end-user feedback for their proposed translations which may be useful for TP prediction. For instance, in early 2015 Facebook introduced a feature letting users rate (Bing) translations, and Google Translate asks for suggested improvements. We are hopeful that such data becomes publicly available. Nevertheless, it remains unlikely to obtain feedback from each and every user. A potential direction for both corpora and feedback collection is personalizing models and identifying preferences for groups of users based on socio-demographic traits, such as gender, age or mother tongue, or based on (e.g. Big 5) personality traits. These can even be inferred by automatically analyzing user texts."
