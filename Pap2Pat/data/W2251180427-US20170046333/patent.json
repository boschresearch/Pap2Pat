The method includes, for each of the users, providing a respective user profile which includes rankings for at least some machine translation systems from a set of machine translation systems. The user profile of the first user is updated, based on the user profiles of at least a subset of the other users. The updating includes generating at least one missing ranking. An optimal translation system for the first user from the set of machine translation systems is predicted, based on the updated user profile computed for the first user.",

                        "With the availability of large amounts of data, customer applications are tending to become more personalized, accommodating the customer's behavior in order to create a unique experience and provide a better service to each user. Such personalization is done through customer modeling, based on the customers' attributes, such as demographics (gender, age, etc.), preferences, and personalities. For example, in the field of information retrieval, search results are often customized based on location or the user's search history. Automatic speech recognition and targeted advertising are other areas where personalization has been successfully employed.",
                        "When customers speak different languages, modeling customers and interacting with them involve multilingual aspects. Multilingual customers may express themselves differently, discuss different topics, and even have a somewhat different personality in each language. Machine translation (MT) systems, however, have not been personalized for customers, in part, because training statistical machine translation (SMT) models relies on the availability of a large amount of parallel training data for the language-pair, i.e., a corpus where each sentence in one language (the source language) is translated to the other language (the target language). Using training data of the same domain of the text being translated has a significant positive impact on the quality of the translation. Domain adaptation allows SMT models to be adapted to a particular topic, genre, or style.",
                        "Domain adaptation can be performed, for example, using an organization's corpora. Other methods include data-selection (Axelrod, A., et al., \u201cDomain adaptation via pseudo in-domain data selection,\u201d EMNLP '11, pp. 355-362 (2011), Gasc\u00f3, G., et al., \u201cDoes more data always yield better translations?\u201d Proc. 13th Conf. of ECACL, pp. 152-161 (2012), Mirkin, S., et al., \u201cData selection for compact adapted SMT models,\u201d AMTA-2014, pp. 301-314 (2014)), mixture models (Foster, G., et al., \u201cMixture-model adaptation for SMT,\u201d Proc. WMT, pp. 128-135 (2007)) and table fill-up (Bisazza, A., et al., \u201cFill-up versus interpolation methods for phrase-based SMT adaptation,\u201d Proc. IWSLT, pp. 136-143 (2011)).",
                        "However, even though domain adaptation can be achieved with a smaller amount of training data than is used for building a machine translation model from scratch, by adaptation of translation systems to the topic, genre or the style of the translated material, such methods do not factor in the user's own particular preferences of one translation over another.",
                        "In some cases, it is feasible to deploy several distinct translation systems (or different models of the same system) and then choose among the multiple alternative translations that are produced for a given input text. The choice may be made by a professional translator or by using automatic estimation of the quality of the translations. These approaches assume that the choice of the best system is independent of the actual user receiving the translation. However, this does not account for the customer's personal translation preferences (TPs) for choosing which translation system to use. TP is a factor when alternative translations are all correct or when each of them is wrong in a different way. In the former case, a preference may be a stylistic choice, and in the latter, a matter of comprehension or a selection of the least intolerable error, in the user's opinion. For example, one user may place a priority on having the syntax correct, even if some words remain untranslated, while another may prefer that all the words are translated, even at the cost of some syntactic flaws. One user may prefer shorter sentences than others, or may favor a more formal style, while another would prefer a more casual style. One user may accept reordering errors but be more demanding concerning punctuations. Such differences may be the result of the type of translation system being employed (e.g. syntax- vs. phrased-based), the specific training data or many other factors. On the user's side, a preference may be attributed, for example, to native language, age, personality, or other factors.",
                        "Users can also utilize their own glossaries (Federico, M., et al., \u201cThe Matecat tool,\u201d Proc. COLING 2014: System Demonstrations, pp. 129-132 (2014)), corpora (parallel or monolingual) and translation memories (TM), either shared or private ones (U.S. Pat. No. 8,805,672 to Caskey, et al.). Through Adaptive and Interactive MT, the system learns from the translator's edits, to avoid repeating errors that have already been corrected (Nepveu, L., et al., \u201cAdaptive language and translation models for interactive machine translation,\u201d Proc. EMNLP, pp. 190-197 (2004)). Post-editions can continuously be added to the translator's TM or be used as additional training material, for tighter adaptation to the domain of interest, through batch or incremental training. While useful, such methods take time to implement and may discourage users from trying new translation models. Additionally, most of the focus is on customization for companies or professional translators.",
                        "Given a set of two or more translation models to choose from, metrics for inter-rater reliability or inter-annotator agreement, such as Cohen's Kappa Cohen, J., \u201cA Coefficient of Agreement for Nominal Scales,\u201d Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20(1) pp. 37-46 (1960) can measure the extent to which annotators disagree on which is the better of two or more translations. Disagreement may be the result of an untrained annotator, a task that is not well defined, or when there is no obvious truth. In the case of the evaluation of translation quality, it is not always straightforward to tell whether one translation is better than another. A single sentence can be translated in multiple correct ways or in multiple incorrect ways. The choice of what is best often depends on the users' preferences. Kappa levels, even when measured on simpler tasks, such as short segments, are often low. (Mach\u00e1{hacek over (c)}ek, M. et al., \u201cEvaluating machine translation quality using short segments annotations,\u201d The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics, No. 103, pp. 85-110 (2015)).",

The exemplary method considers the users' overall preferences of systems, without regard to the specific sentence that is being translated. However, in other embodiments, the system may be adapted to take into account other factors, such as domain-specific factors, or features of the sentence being translated (e.g., does sentence contain named entities, is it long or short), or the like, provided sufficient training data is available for evaluating the influence of sentence features on user translation preferences.",

The preferences of translators, however, may be driven by the ease of correction more than anything else. When the users are end-users (the readers of the translations produced) rather than translators who constitute a completely different user group, a relatively simple kind of explicit feedback, such as a binary feedback (\u2018good\u2019/\u2018bad\u2019 translation), from which users preferences and similarity can be inferred may be used.

To identify such outliers, the vector of system pair preferences for each user is used to compute a single vector with the average preferences of all users, excluding the assessed user. Missing values in the vectors are replaced with a fixed value, such as 0.0. This is not always a correct strategy to impute missing values, but it is a reasonable one since it corresponds to the user not having any preference between the two systems (i.e., wins=losses). Then a paired t-test (or paired Wilcoxon test) is performed between the vector of each user and the average vector, and the users for which the test resulted with p less than a threshold value, e.g., p<0.05, are marked as outliers and excluded/included.

The significance test captures the fact that the methods disagreed in many more cases than is visible by the score difference. The CTP method was found superior to all others also when computing macro-average, taking the average of the scores of each language pair, as well as the results when the ties are included in the computation of pu.",

It is reasonable to assume that tuning these parameters could improve results. For example, selecting k, the number of users, to include in the similarity function, may be made dependent on the total number of users. E.g., for en-es, where there are only 57 users in total, reducing k's value from 50 to 25, improves results of CTP from 62.6% to 63.2%, higher than all other methods (whose scores are not affected).",

                                "One weakness of CTP, as well as other methods, is that they do not always predict ties well. In the above experiment, approximately 13.5% of the actual preferences were 0 and none of them was correctly identified. It appears that numerical accuracy is not the main cause of this. Rather, setting any prediction that is smaller than some values of |\u03b5| to 0 deteriorated performance. Arguably, ties need not be predicted, since if the user has no preference between two systems, any choice is just as good. Still, with better ties prediction, a general improvement in the method is expected. For example, the user could be asked to review more sentences and their translations when the pairwise ranking is close to 0.",
