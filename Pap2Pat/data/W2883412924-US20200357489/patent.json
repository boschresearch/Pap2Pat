                        "According to statistics, it takes 10-14 years for each new drug from research, testing to product launch, costing more than US$200 million. How to speed up the discovery and testing of new drugs has always been the key and difficult point of accelerating drug development. In recent years, the development of disciplines such as biochemistry, physiology and pathology has led to new methods for drug screening, such as some molecular and cellular drug screening models. High throughput screening technology (HTS) was developed in the late 1990s based on the described models and the development of more advanced detection technology, automation technology and computer technology. HTS relies mainly on automated operating systems, ie laboratory robot and high-sensitivity detection methods, including spectrophotometry and fluorescence detection technology. The emergence of HTS has greatly accelerated the speed of drug screening, but it still has great limitations, including high cost, difficulty in model establishment, and limited number of models. China started late in the study of drug screening systems, and only a few national key laboratories have HTS systems. Laboratory robots are difficult to popularize due to their high cost, and various detection methods are still inseparable from manual statistics and analysis.",
                        "To the present, new drug screening technology has been increasingly combined with rapidly improving computer technology. In previous studies, computer technology was mostly used for the statistical processing of experimental data and the analysis and classification of existing features. Further applications of computer technology include computer-aided drug design. In recent years, there have been some studies applying machine learning to improve the effect of virtual screening. However, although virtual screening plays an important role in drug screening, it still relies on the existing small molecule database and various features that have been artificially classified, which is not enough to reflect the actual application efficacy of drugs. Various scientific research institutions and laboratories need a new drug screening system that can be used to evaluate drug efficacy. The drug screening system must have the advantages of high accuracy, strong anti-interference ability, short time consumption and low costs rather than the high cost like laboratory robots, and not limited by the existing database and artificial feature classification.",
                        "In summary, the existing drug screening system cannot meet the growing scientific research needs. Therefore, it is critical to establish a simple, efficient, accurate, and low-cost high-throughput drug screening system. We consider applying machine learning methods to the establishment of laboratory drug screening systems.",
                        "Deep learning is a branch of machine learning. Its concept is derived from the research of artificial neural networks. According to imitating the mechanism of the human brain to observe and interpret various data, it combines low-level features to form high-level representation attribute categories, thereby discovering distributed characteristics of data. Deep learning has become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years because that its training process can extract and integrate features, collect and process large data, and has excellent universal applicability.",
                        "Chinese Patent Application No. 2017101273955 disclosed an intelligent lead compound discovery method based on convolutional neural network, which solves the problems of low efficiency and low accuracy of current lead compound virtual screening. In this method, first, the structural formula of the compound is transformed into a plane picture, and the black-and-white and anti color processing are carried out. Then all the pictures are classified according to the active attributes of the compounds, labeled with numbers according to the categories, and input into the system. Next, a part of the pictures are selected as training set for the convolutional neural network to learn how to classify deeply, and the rest of the pictures are used as test set to evaluate the model. Finally, after the deep learning is completed, a same processed picture other than the training set and the test set is input to the system to calculate the probability that the compound on the picture has a certain active attribute.",

In addition, we found that the model has a strong anti-interference ability for the evaluation of drugs with spontaneous fluorescence, and there is no significant difference in the accuracy of the model between drugs with or without fluorescence interference. In conclusion, DeepScreen, a drug screening system based on deep learning, has the advantages of high throughput, precision, high efficiency, high speed, convenience, low costs and interference resistance, and has a practical application prospect worthy of attention.",
