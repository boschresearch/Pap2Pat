- generate and infect breast fibroblasts
- perform animal surgeries and tissue analysis

## EXAMPLE 1

### Generation of “Humanized” Mammary Fat Pads

- generate humanized mammary fat pads

### EXAMPLE 2

- develop human breast ducts in chimeric mammary fat pads
- analyze ductal structures and cell proliferation

### EXAMPLE 3

- investigate effect of stromal alterations on MECs
- modify stroma with growth factors
