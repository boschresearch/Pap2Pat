                        "Cancer is considered to be a serious and pervasive disease. The National Cancer Institute has estimated that in the United States alone, 1 in 3 people will be afflicted with cancer during their lifetime. Moreover approximately 50% to 60% of people contracting cancer will eventually die from the disease. One particularly prevalent form of cancer, especially among women, is breast cancer. The incidence of breast cancer, a leading cause of death in women, has been gradually increasing in the United States over the last thirty years. In 1997, it was estimated that 181,000 new cases were reported in the U.S., and that 44,000 people would die of breast cancer (Parker et al, 1997, CA Cancer J. Clin. 47:5-27; Chu et al, 1996, J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 88:1571-1579).",
                        "The study of normal breast epithelial morphogenesis and carcinogenesis in vivo has largely utilized rodent models. Efforts at studying mammary morphogenesis and cancer with xenotransplanted human epithelial cells have failed to recapitulate the full extent of development seen in the human breast. It would be helpful to have an animal model which more closely mimics human breast tissue morphogenesis and carcinogenesis. Such animals may allow the identification of therapeutic agents to treat or prevent cancer, as well as in the identification of genes which contribute to or which antagonize tumorigenesis."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The present invention relates to novel rodent models comprising allogenic grafts. One aspect of the invention relates to a mouse model, referred to as an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, in which the stromal and epithelial components of the reconstructed mammary gland are of human origin. The reconstructed human mammary glands form functional human breast ducts and lobules. Genetic modification of human stromal cells prior to implantation of ostensibly normal human mammary epithelial cells resulted in the outgrowth of benign and malignant lesions in the mice. This experimental model makes it possible to study human epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation in vivo under conditions which mimic those of the human breast. In addition, the model is useful to assess the effects of agents on breast tissue. For example, it can be used to identify or assess therapies, such as drugs, hormones, polypeptides, surgical techniques, radiation methods, or gene therapies for breast abnormalities, such as cancer, mastitis and fat necrosis. It is also useful to identify or assess factors or conditions, such as genetic makeup, environmental conditions, dietary patterns, stress, sexual behavior, bacterial or viral infections, immune responses, or exercise that may contribute to the development of breast abnormalities or confer protection against such abnormalities.",
                        "Furthermore, this experimental model is useful to identify genes that suppress or contribute to the development of breast abnormalities. This can be accomplished by altering gene activity in any of the components of the orthotopic xenograft mouse model described herein, including in the mouse adipose tissue, mouse fibroblasts, human fibroblasts or human epithelial cells, or in a combination thereof. Gene activity can be altered by numerous means, such as by introducing an exogenous gene or transgene, either wild-type or mutant, generating knockout mutations or gain-of-function mutations, or reducing gene activity through, for example, RNA interference or antibodies.",
                        "In a particular embodiment, the present invention is a mouse model in which the stromal component and the epithelial component of mammary glands are of human origin and the mammary glands form human breast ducts and/or lobules. In a specific embodiment, the human breast ducts are functional human breast ducts, such as human breast ducts which produce milk when the mouse is pregnant. In another specific embodiment, the mouse is an immunocompromised mouse in which the stromal component and the epithelial component of mammary glands are of human origin and the mammary glands form functional human breast ducts and lobules. Human breast tissue in the mouse model can be normal or abnormal. For example, it can mimic the characteristics of normal (nondiseased) human breast tissue or of abnormal human breast tissue, such as breast tissue with benign or malignant lesions. Normal and abnormal tissue can be obtained from women or men, using known techniques, such as those described herein. Alternatively, abnormal tissue can be produced by genetic modification of human stromal cells, human epithelial cells or both types of cells implanted into mice to produce a xenograft. Human stromal cells and/or human epithelial cells can be genetically modified prior to or after implantation into mice.",
                        "The invention also provides methods of generating the orthotopic xenograft mouse model. In one embodiment, the invention is a method of producing a humanized mammary fat pad, wherein human breast fibroblast cells are interspersed in mouse mammary adipose tissue, the method comprising: (a) generating nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts; (b) treating the nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts to induce their proliferation and their invasion into a mouse fat pad and introducing the nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts into a cleared mammary fat pad from an immunocompromised mouse; and (c) allowing sufficient time for the nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts to divide and invade into the cleared mammary fat pad, thereby producing a humanized mammary fat pad. In a specific embodiment, the nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts comprise immortalized nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts.",
                        "Furthermore, the invention provides a method of generating a mouse having at least one humanized mammary gland by introducing a composition comprising human mammary epithelial cells or human breast stem cells or both, into the humanized mammary fat pad of a mouse and allowing sufficient time for an epithelial outgrowth to develop, thereby forming a humanized mammary gland. U.S. patent Publication No. 2004/0037815 describes, in Example 2, methods for the isolation of breast stem cells, and WO03/060108 describes breast stem cells capable of differentiating into cells of mammary gland luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cell lineages and methods of isolating such cells. Additional publications describing the isolation of human breast stem cells include Clayton et al. Exp Cell Res. 2004;297(2):444-60; Boecker W et al., Cell Prolif. 2003;36 Suppl 1:73-84; and Welm et al. Cell Prolif. October 2003 ;36 Suppl 1:17-32.",
                        "In a specific embodiment, the humanized mammary gland comprises human breast ducts. In a further embodiment, the human breast ducts are functional and produce milk when the mouse is pregnant, when the mouse is treated with hormones which mimic the pregnant state, or both.",
                        "The invention further provides a modification of the mice and methods described herein in which the human mammary stromal fibroblast are replaced with non-human, non-mouse mammary stromal fibroblasts which are capable of supporting the morphogenesis of human mammary epithelial cells into human breast ducts. In a specific embodiment, the non-human, non-mouse mammary stromal fibroblasts comprise primate mammary stromal fibroblasts or mammary stromal fibroblasts from a species that is closely related evolutionarily to humans, such as a species from the same genus as humans.",
                        "Another embodiment of the invention relates to methods of screening for agents that modulate the growth, differentiation or morphogenesis of breast epithelial cells. In one aspect, the invention provides a method of determining whether an agent affects the growth, differentiation or morphogenesis of human breast epithelial cells, comprising (a) contacting the agent with a humanized mammary gland of a mouse, wherein the humanized mammary gland is comprised of (i) a humanized mammary fat pad comprised of human stromal fibroblast cells interspersed in mouse adipose tissue; (ii) an epithelial outgrowth comprised of human breast epithelial cells; and (iii) human breast; and (b) detecting an effect of the agent on the growth of the breast epithelial cells; and (c) selecting the agent which increases or decreases the growth of the breast epithelial cells.",
                        "In related aspects, the invention provides methods for identifying a drug that inhibits abnormal growth of human breast epithelial cells, comprising (a) contacting a candidate drug to be assessed with a humanized mammary gland of a mouse, wherein the humanized mammary gland is comprised of (i) a humanized mammary fat pad comprised of human stromal fibroblast cells interspersed in mouse adipose tissue; (ii) an epithelial outgrowth comprised of human breast epithelial cells; and (iii) human breast ducts; and (b) determining if the candidate drug inhibits abnormal growth of the human breast epithelial cells; and (c) selecting the candidate drug that inhibits abnormal growth of the human breast epithelial cells."

As used herein, the term \u201cimmortalized nontumorigenic fibroblast\u201d refers to fibroblasts which can divide repeatedly in cell culture without entering senescence, and which do not form tumors on nude mice or form colonies on soft agar. Immortalized nontumorigenic fibroblast can be generated by isolating human stromal fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasty tissue, from men or women, and expanding them in vitro, such as through the use of standard cell culture techniques. The primary human stromal fibroblasts are then immortalized by the ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase or other proteins known to immortalize fibroblasts, such as the SV40 large T antigen. Combinations of proteins may also be used to improve the efficiency of immortalization, such as the SV40 large T antigen and c-myc. The telomerase catalytic subunit used can be human, mouse or other origin and can be exogenous DNA introduced into cells or endogenous DNA encoding the catalytic subunit. For example, ectopic expression of telomerase catalytic subunit can be achieved by turning on or upregulating the activity of an endogenous hTERT gene, such as by increasing activity of the hTERT promoter. Alternatively, a DNA vector encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, driven by a promoter which is transcriptionally active in human stromal fibroblasts, such as a viral promoter, is introduced as a transgene into the human stromal fibroblasts, to produce human stromal fibroblasts which ectopically express a catalytic telomerase subunit.",

Other methods can be used, such as electroporation or liposome-mediated transfection of vectors comprising DNA encoding human telomerase catalytic subunit. In a further embodiment, a GFP-encoding transgene is also introduced into the stromal fibroblast cells to facilitate their subsequent identification within the humanized mammary fat pad. Vectors for expressing the proteins described herein may be selected from commercial sources or constructed for a particular expression system. Such vectors may contain appropriate regulatory sequences, such as promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences and marker genes. Vectors may be plasmids, or viral-based.",

Stromal fibroblasts ectopically expressing growth factors which promote the growth of human mammary epithelial cells are particularly desirable to induce abnormal cell growth and to increase the incidence of tumors in humanized mammary glands. Such mice can be used as a sensitized assay system to identity agents, such as drugs, that reduce the incidence or growth of mammary gland tumors.

In other embodiments, the nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts are treated to induce their proliferation and their invasion into a mouse fat pad after they are introduced into the cleared mammary fat pad. When the treatment of the nontumorigenic human mammary stromal fibroblasts is performed after their introduction into the cleared fat pad, the treatment may comprise a localized or a systemic treatment. For instance, if radiation is used to activate the fibroblasts, the radiation can be administered locally to the area of the mammary fat pad, or the entire mouse can be irradiated. When radiation is administered locally, it may administered through a source of external radiation or through the temporary or permanent implantation of a radioactive composition."

These organoid preparations are clusters of human myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells, each containing 100 to 10,000 human cells that no longer contain or represent any preexisting structure from the human breast (Friedrichs et al. Cancer Res. 1995; 55:901-906). In one embodiment, 15-30 organoids are pooled and dissociated using a 23 gauge needle and syringue. Alternatively, human mammary epithelial cells may be purchased from commercial sources, such as from Clonetics (Cambrex). Methods for isolating human mammary epithelial stem cells have been described in the art, such as in Smith et al., Microsc Res Tech. 2001; 52(2):190-203; Welm et al. Cell Prolif. 2003; 36 Suppl 1:17-32; Dontu et al. Genes Dev. 2003, 17(10):1253-70; and Trosko et al. Oncol Res. 2003;13(6-10):353-7, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",

One skilled in the art can determine the optimal number for a given application. For example, a composition comprising mostly mammary epithelial cells would contain more cells than one containing mostly breast stem cells. In one embodiment, the composition additionally comprises phosphate buffer saline, cell culture media, matrigel, or collagen, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the composition comprises matrigel and collagen from about a 1:1 to a 3:1 ratio.",

In a specific embodiment, both myoepithelial cells and luminal epithelial cells are introduced into the humanized mammary fat pad, such as by injection, to generate a humanized mammary gland, while in another specific embodiment myoepithelial cells, luminal epithelial cells and breast stem cells are introduced.",
                                "In the methods for generating a humanized mammary gland from a humanized mammary fat pad described herein, the introduction of a composition comprising human mammary epithelial cells into the humanized mammary fat pad is done after the nontumorigenic human stromal fibroblasts of the fat pad have had sufficient time to divide and invade into the adipose tissue of the mammary fat pad. For example, this might be from about 1 to about 60 days, from about 7 to about 21 days, or about two weeks after the nontumorigenic human stromal fibroblasts have been introduced into the cleared mouse mammary fat pad. I one embodiment, the introduction of the composition comprising human mammary epithelial cells and/or human breast stem cells into the humanized mammary fat pad is done at about puberty or after puberty, and hormones are administered to the mouse. In one embodiment, the introduction of a composition comprising human mammary epithelial cells into the humanized mammary fat pad is done by injecting the composition into the same general area as the injection of the stromal fibroblasts.",

Human breast fibroblasts can also be isolated from MEC organoids (Gudjonsson et al., Genes Dev. 2002; 16(6):693-706). In specific embodiments, from about 0 to about 500,000 human breast fibroblasts are coinjected with the human mammary epithelial cells and/or with the human breast stem cells into a humanized mammary fat pad to generate a humanized mammary gland. An exact number may be determined empirically by one skilled in the art. Thus in one embodiment, the humanized mammary glands of the mice described herein are comprised of human breast fibroblasts and human epithelial cells.",

In one embodiment, the genetic modification results in the altered function of an endogenous oncogene or tumor suppressor gene. In another embodiment, the genetic modification increases the propensity for tumor formation. In another embodiment, the genetically modified comprises an expression construct having a constitutive or an inducible promoter. Transgenes can be introduced into epithelial cells or fibroblasts, for example, using retroviruses or lentiviruses. Transgenes may include, but are not limited to growth factors, receptors, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, cytokines, chemokines, signaling molecules, cell cycle genes such as cyclins or cyclin dependent kinases or phosphatases, and growth factor receptors. In specific embodiments, the transgene may be GFP, prolactin, erbB2 (her2), cyclin D1, EGF receptor, estrogen receptor, sip53 or siBRCA1. In some embodiments, transgenes encode functional polypeptides, mutant polypeptides, dominant negative polypeptides, or encode inhibitory RNAs, such as double stranded or hairpin RNAs. In specific embodiments, genetic modifications the human mammary fibroblasts included a plurality of modifications, such as a cell which contains a knockout mutation and which expresses one or more transgenes.",
                                "In another embodiment, the human mammary epithelial cells of the present invention are tumorigenic. In another embodiment, the human breast stem cells can divide and differentiate to generate human mammary epithelial cells which are tumorigenic. These epithelial cells might be derived from human breast tumors, premalignant tissue, tumor cell-lines, benign breast lesions, or by genetic modification of normal epithelial cells. In another embodiment, the human mammary epithelial cells or the human breast stem cells are isolated from women at risk of developing breast cancer, such as those with genetic predispositions. In a particular embodiment, these women at risk for developing breast cancer have not yet been diagnosed with breast tumors, breast cancers or other malignant breast growths.",

The donor mouse may be of the same or a different genetic background as the recipient mouse. For example, the donor mouse might be an HGF transgenic mouse overexpressing HGF while the recipient is a NOD/SCID mouse.",

In one embodiment, the epithelial outgrowth has a ductal, lobular or acinar morphology. In a further embodiment, the epithelial outgrowth comprises human breast ducts, acini, or both. In another embodiment, the epithelial outgrowth produces milk when the mouse has given birth. In another embodiment, the epithelial outgrowths comprise human acini which produce milk.",
                                "To induce full differentiation and morphogenesis of the epithelial outgrowth, the mouse can be made pregnant. Therefore, one embodiment of the present invention provides a pregnant mouse having at least one humanized mammary gland. Alternatively, hormones can be administered to the mouse to mimic a pregnant or a specific hormonal state. In one specific embodiment, the human breast ducts produce milk when the mouse is pregnant.",

In a specific embodiment, the epithelial outgrowth comprises hyperplastic or neoplastic outgrowths, such as tumors or carcinomas. Mice having humanized mammary glands with hyperplastic outgrowths or tumors are particularly useful to screen for agents, such as drugs, that inhibit the growth or development of the hyperplastic outgrowths.",

In one embodiment, the human breast ducts produce milk when the mouse is pregnant.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cagent\u201d includes both compositions, environmental factor, and methods of treatment. An agent can a composition, such as a drug, a small molecule, a polypeptide including modified peptides such as by pegylation, a nucleic acid including single and double stranded DNA and RNA, a virus, a peptide, a hormone such as estrogen or leutenizing hormone, a growth factor or a cell. The agent can also be a method of treatment, such as a surgical procedure or laser treatment. The agent can be an environmental factor, such as humidity, temperature, noise, diet, exercise, or sexual activity. The agent may act directly on the humanized mammary gland, such as a laser treatment of the mammary gland, or the agent may act primarily at another organ or part of the mouse, such as an occlusion of renal arteries to cause kidney failure.",
                                "An agent can be any chemical (element, molecule, compound), made synthetically or made by a recombinant technique or isolated from a natural source. For example, agents can be peptides, polypeptides, antibodies or antibody fragments, peptoids, sugars, hormones, or nucleic acid molecules (such as antisense or RNAi nucleic acid molecules). In addition, agents can be small organic molecules or molecules of greater complexity made by, for example, combinatorial chemistry. These libraries can comprise, for example, alcohols, alkyl halides, amines, amides, esters, aldehydes, ethers and other classes of organic compounds. Agents can also be natural or genetically engineered products isolated from lysates or growth media of cells\u2014bacterial, animal or plant.",
                                "In one embodiment of the methods described herein, the agent is an RNAi construct. As used herein, the term \u201cRNAi construct\u201d includes small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), hairpin RNAs, and other RNA species which can be cleaved in vivo to form siRNAs. The term RNAi construct also includes expression vectors (also referred to as RNAi expression vectors) that give rise to transcripts which form dsRNAs or hairpin RNAs in cells, and/or transcripts which can produce siRNAs in vivo. As used herein, \u201cdsRNA\u201d refers to double stranded RNA. In some embodiments, dsRNA further contains DNA nucleotides at the 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 ends of either or both RNA strands.",
                                "In one embodiment of the methods described herein, RNA interference (RNAi) effects knockdown of a protein, such as a protein suspected of modulating tumor formation. RNAi constructs comprise double stranded RNA that can specifically block expression of a target protein. RNAi provides a useful method of inhibiting gene expression in vitro or in vivo. RNAi constructs can comprise either long stretches of dsRNA identical or substantially identical to the target nucleic acid sequence or short stretches of dsRNA identical to substantially identical to only a region of the target nucleic acid sequence.",
                                "The subject RNAi constructs can be \u201csmall interfering RNAs\u201d or \u201csiRNAs.\u201d These nucleic acids are around 19-30 nucleotides in length, and even more preferably 21-23 nucleotides in length. The RNAi construct can also be in the form of a long double-stranded RNA. In certain embodiments, the RNAi construct is at least 25, 50, 100, 200, 300 or 400 bases. In certain embodiments, the RNAi construct is 400-800 bases in length. The double-stranded RNAs are digested intracellularly, e.g., to produce siRNA sequences in the cell.",

                                "In one embodiment of the methods described herein, the agent or drug is an agent, such as tamoxifen, that can block the production of natural hormones like estrogen, or may comprise aromatase inhibitors which prevent the synthesis of estradiol.",
                                "The invention also provides a method of identifying a drug that inhibits abnormal growth of human breast epithelial cells, comprising (a) contacting a candidate drug to be assessed with a humanized mammary gland of a mouse, wherein the humanized mammary gland is comprised of (i) a humanized mammary fat pad comprised of human stromal fibroblast cells interspersed in mouse adipose tissue; (ii) an epithelial outgrowth comprised of human breast epithelial cells; and (iii) human breast ducts; and (b) determining if the candidate drug inhibits abnormal growth of the human breast epithelial cells; and (c) selecting the candidate drug that inhibits abnormal growth of the human breast epithelial cells. In one embodiment, the human breast ducts produce milk. If the candidate drug inhibits abnormal growth, it is a drug that may further be tested as a therapeutic in treating or preventing the development of breast tumors or breast cancers in humans. When a drug is administered to a mouse which has at least one humanized mammary gland to ascertain if the drug inhibits the abnormal growth of human mammary epithelial cells or the formation of tumors, it is advantageous for the untreated control mouse to develop tumors.",
                                "Drugs or agents may be administered to the mice of the present invention through oral, rectal, intravaginal, topical, nasal, opthalmic, or parenteral administration. Furthermore, the drugs or agents may be administered locally or systemically, and may be adminstered as part of a dosing regimen requiring single or repeated administrations. As used herein, \u201cparenteral\u201d includes but is not limited to subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrastemal injections or infusion techniques. As used herein, \u201cadministering\u201d may be effected or performed using any of the methods known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the agent or drug is introduced into the food or drink of the mouse for oral consumption. In another embodiment, the drug or agent is administered by transdermal injection or by injection into the tail vein.",
                                "Determining if a drug inhibits abnormal growth, differentiation or morphogenesis of the human mammary epithelial cells, or if the human mammary epithelial cells are more or less sensitive to the drug, can be done using methods known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the amount of programmed cell death of human mammary epithelial cells in response to the agent or drug is measured. In another embodiment, the level of angiogenesis in response to the agent or a drug may be used as an assay. In a specific embodiment, the number of hyperplastic growths such as ductal hyperplasias, carcinomas in situ or invasive ductal carcinomas in the humanized mammary glands from mice contacted with and without the drug, are compared. A decrease in the extent to which hyperplasia occurs indicates that the drug inhibits abnormal growth of human mammary epithelial cells. In another embodiment, the distribution of hyperplastic events in a humanized mammary gland, such as ductal hyperplasias, carcinomas in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas which reflect the progression of cancer in humans, is compared in mice to whom a candidate drug has been administered and an appropriate control, such as mice who have not received the drug, to determine if a drug reduces the incidence of a particular type of hyperplasia. This embodiment is useful to determine if a drug preferentially blocks one step of cancer progression.",
                                "In other embodiments, the size of the abnormal growth or tumor can be determined in mice administered the drug and in control mice. In other embodiments of the methods described herein, multiple agents are tested for their effects on the growth, differentiation or morphogenesis of the human breast epithelial cells. One skilled in the art may chose the appropriate control to use in the methods described herein for identifying an agent or a drug. In one embodiment, the control animal comprises an animal identical or substantially identical to the experimental animal but to which no drug or agent is administered. In another embodiment, the control animal may receive a lower dosage of the drug or agent than the experimental animal. In another embodiment, the agent or drug is administered locally to one humanized mammary gland in a mice having two humanized mammary gland, such that the second mammary gland may serve as a control.",
                                "In one aspect, the invention provides methods of determining if a drug is specific for breast cancer. For example, candidate anti-breast cancer drugs can first be screened for their effects on other assay systems such as (i) breast cancer cell lines in culture; (ii) primary cancer cells in culture; or (iii) human breast cancer lines transplanted into mice. Drugs that show therapeutic promise may then be tested using any of the mouse variants described in the invention that have a humanized mammary gland.",
                                "Furthermore, the invention provides methods to test for the specificity of a drug for treating a given form of breast abnormality, such as cancer. In one embodiment, the mice used in the assays described herein have breast cancers reconstituted from patients having a specific form of breast cancer. For instance, in one embodiment, breast tumors are reconstituted from patients carrying mutations or altered gene expression of erbB2/neu, BRCA1, BRCA2 or p53 genes to assay for the specificity of a drug for a particular type of breast cancer. One skilled in the art may chose any type of breast cancer or pre-malignant tissue.",
                                "The mice of the present invention may also be used for assess the effects of a candidate therapeutic in any breast abnormality. In fact, the utility of the mice is not limited to nay particular type of breast disorder. In one embodiment, the breast disorder is selected from the group consisting of fibroadenoma, papilloma, adenosis, epitheliosis, blunt duct adenosis, sclerosing adenosis, nodular adenosis, and florid adenosis, microglandular adenosis, tubular adenosis, apocrine adenosis, and myoepithelial (adenomyoepithelial) adenosis.",
                                "The invention also provides variations of the methods for identifying agents and drugs described herein where the drug or agent is administered before the mice develop functional humanized mammary glands. In one embodiment, the agent is administered before the humanized mammary fat pad is generated, before the human breast epithelial cells or the human breast stem cells are introduced into the fat pad, or before the human breast epithelial cells or the human breast stem cells have divided and form functional outgrowths.",
                                "The invention further provides methods of studying agents which affect the development of human breast from human breast stem cells. In one embodiment, human breast stem cells are introduced into humanized mammary fat pads to study their development into human breast. Factors or drugs may be screened for their effects on the proliferation and differentiation of these cells into ductal, acinar or epithelial cell types.",
                                "In the methods described herein for generally assessing the effects of a drug or agent on the development or morphogenesis of a humanized mammary gland, any invasive or noninvasive techniques known to one skilled in the art may be employed. Non-invasive techniques include NMR, CAT scans, fluoroscopy, roentgenography, radionuclide scanning, ultrasonography, electrocardiography, electroencephalography, evoked potentials, etc. Invasive techniques include biopsy, autopsy, laparotomy, laparoscopy, intermittent intravenous blood sampling, or intravenous catheterization, etc. Convenient placement of various devices, e.g., catheters, electrodes, etc., may be performed for continuous monitoring.",
                                "In some of embodiments of the methods and mice described herein, the human breast ducts make milk or are capable of making milk. In a specific embodiment, the human breast ducts can make milk when the mouse is pregnant, when the mouse is treated with hormones, or when the humanized mammary glands are stimulated physically. It is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that a mouse having a functional human breast duct which makes milk, and therefore is said to be a functional human breast duct, can be made not to secrete milk if, for example, the genes encoding the milk proteins were deleted or otherwise genetically altered in the human mammary epithelial cells or in the human breast stem cells. Likewise, treatment of pregnant mice with drugs or hormones may prevent an otherwise pregnant mice having functional breast ducts unable to make milk under those conditions, but which would otherwise be able to make milk in the absence of the drug or hormonal treatment. Accordingly, mice which have human breast ducts capable of making milk, but which are genetically modified or otherwise treated with an agent to prevent the production of milk, are still considered to be functional human breast ducts, and therefore such mice are within the scope of the invention.",

J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975;55:1461-1466) indicating that human epithelial cells are unable to establish themselves in the murine mammary stroma and to participate in normal mammary ductal morphogenesis. For reasons discussed above, the failure of human MECs to properly colonize the mouse mammary fat pad suggested the need to establish human mammary stromal cells in fat pads prior to implantation of the epithelial cells. Accordingly, Applicants developed a line of GFP-labeled, hTERT-immortalized human mammary stromal fibroblasts; these cells had previously been prepared from a reduction mammoplasty. These fibroblasts (hereafter termed RMF/EG) are ostensibly normal and non-tumorigenic. They do not form colonies in soft agar and do not form tumors in immunocompromised mice",
                                "When the RMF/EG fibroblasts were injected into the cleared mammary fat pads of unirradiated NOD/SCID mice, the cells survived, but little proliferation or expansion of the introduced cells was observed. Therefore, Applicants sought to facilitate engraftment of the RNF/EG fibroblasts and subsequent proliferation by exploiting observations made by others that irradiated fibroblasts undergo a physiological activation that results in the expression of proteases, matrix proteins and a variety of growth factors (Panizzon et al. Radiat Res. 1988; 116:145-156; Barcellos-Hoff et al. Development. 1989;105:223-235). Accordingly, Applicants irradiated 2.5\u00d7105 immortalized human stromal fibroblasts with 4 Gy of radiation and injected these, together with an equal number of non-irradiated fibroblasts into cleared mouse mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice. This was done to determine if the irradiated fibroblasts would enable the engraftment and invasion of the co-injected non-irradiated cells in the mouse stromal fat pad.",
                                "Mammary fat pads that had been injected with these cell mixtures were examined by carmine wholemount analysis at various times between 2 and 8 weeks post-injection, and no detectable changes were observed. However, examination of the mammary fat pads for GFP expression at 4 and 8 weeks after injection clearly demonstrated sites of engraftment and expansion of the human breast fibroblasts within these fat pads. (FIGS. 1A, 1B). Invasion of individual human fibroblasts into the mouse adipose stroma could be observed at high magnification. In addition, large cords of GFP-labeled fibroblasts could also be detected by histology in some of the fat pads (FIG. 1C).",
                                "Immunohistochemistry was initially performed on those chimeric fat pads in which cords of fibroblasts had previously been observed by histology. In these cases, the cords of cells were found to be comprised of proliferating fibroblasts expressing human-specific vimentin (FIGS. 1D,1E) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). However, since the great majority of fat pads did not contain readily apparent cords of engrafted fibroblasts, it was difficult to confirm \u201chumanization\u201d by histology in most cases. Therefore, to address whether the RMF/EG fibroblasts had indeed survived and colonized the mouse mammary cleared fat pads, genomic fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on cleared mammary stromal tissues that did not contain histological evidence of stromal outgrowth at either 4 or 8 weeks after injection. A probe specific for mouse Cot1 DNA or for human genomic DNA (prepared by labeling unfractionated human DNA) was hybridized against sections of the humanized mouse mammary fat pads. Examination of these tissues revealed the existence of the human breast fibroblasts interspersed in murine adipose tissue, indicating that these human cells had indeed survived and integrated within the mouse mammary stroma (FIG. 1F)."

Accordingly, following the construction of a chimeric mammary fat pad, human MEC organoids were prepared from histologically normal human reduction mammoplasty tissues. Organoids are clusters of human myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells, each containing 100 to 1000 cells that are no longer organized in structures resembling those in the normal human breast (Friedrichs et al. Cancer Res. 1995;55:901-906). From 20 to 25 organoids were mixed with 2.5\u00d7105 primary human breast fibroblasts that had also been recently isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues. The mixed cell preparations were then introduced into the murine stromal fat pads that had been humanized 2 weeks earlier through the introduction of human stromal fibroblasts.",
                                "Eight weeks after the introduction of the organoids and admixed fibroblasts, the xenografted mammary glands were removed and subjected to wholemount analysis. Three types of epithelial outgrowths were reproducibly observed among all the xenografts. The relative frequencies of these ductal, lobular and acinar structures varied from one set of donor organoids to another (FIG. 2). When the primary normal breast fibroblasts were not admixed to these organoids prior to engraftment into humanized fat pads, only stunted and deformed looking structures developed.",
                                "The most frequently observed outgrowths were of acinar shape, consisting of spherical structures with hollow lumina. Less commonly observed were linear ductal outgrowths with little side-branching (FIG. 2B). As is observed following the standard mouse mammary transplantation technique, ductal development occurred in the absence of additional ectopic estrogen or progesterone hormonal stimulation if the engraftment process was undertaken prior to the end of puberty. Similar to other observations with engrafted murine MECs, the frequency of human ductal elongation decreased significantly when engraftment of the organoids and fibroblasts occurred after puberty in the recipients. In addition to this ductal and acinar development, full ductal-lobular development occurred when mice bearing these human grafts became pregnant (FIG. 2C).",
                                "Genomic FISH was performed on paraffin sections of the xenograft outgrowths to determine the origins of the epithelial and stromal cells in the xenografts (FIG. 3A). As anticipated, all of the epithelial structures were of human origin and a significant proportion of the stroma was also of human origin. However, a substantial portion of murine cells could also be found in the stroma. A vascular response was observed within the stroma surrounding the xenografts, as evidenced by the dilation of existing vessels and neo-vascularization that had apparently occurred as a part of normal epithelial development (FIG. 3B).",
                                "Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on the xenografts in order to examine the morphology and marker expression of the ductal structures (FIG. 4). Normal human mammary ducts are composed of luminal MECs separated from the basement membrane by an intervening layer of myoepithelial cells. To determine if the engrafted human MECs were established in their proper histological positions, myoepithelial cell-specific expression of smooth muscle actin was examined. Indeed, cells located on the basal side of the ducts stained positive for smooth muscle actin and lacked expression of the estrogen receptor, indicating the presence of myoepithelial cells (FIG. 4C). Conversely, luminal cell-specific markers, such as cytokeratin 19, estrogen receptor, and E-cadherin, were expressed in the luminal cells of the ducts (FIGS. 4C and 4E). Finally, sections were examined for the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (FIG. 4F). More than 10% of epithelial cells and 2% of the stromal compartment of the xenografts stained positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). As normal human breast tissue rarely contains proliferating stromal cells and less than 2% of epithelial cells proliferating at any given time during the menstrual cycle (Shoker et al. Am J Pathol. 1999;155:1811-1815), this indicate that cells in the reconstructed breast tissue were actively proliferating in vivo.",
                                "Mice bearing xenografts were mated and allowed to develop until day 18 of pregnancy in order to determine whether full functional differentiation of the human breast tissue had been achieved. Indeed, Applicants observed active lipid synthesis and secretion into the lumina of the human acini (FIG. 4G). Tissue sections were examined for human \u03b2-casein expression, and milk protein could be detected both within the luminal MECs lining the acini and in the lumina of the human breast acini (FIG. 4H). Taken together, these various observations indicate that histologically normal, functional human breast tissue can be constructed in mice and that this outcome is dependent on the presence of human stromal cells. Moreover, the mouse mammary stromal fibroblasts that are present in the reconstructed stroma do not appear to impede this process. Furthermore, various stages of human mammary gland development can be recapitulated in vivo, including the production of milk."

                                "Applicants speculated that the primary human mammary fibroblasts that were admixed to the human mammary organoids prior to engraftment might in some fashion affect the morphogenetic abilities of the human MECs in these organoids. To address this possibility, Applicants introduced 10 human mammary epithelial organoid preparations isolated from 10 different patients into humanized stromal fat pads either with or without prior addition of primary human mammary stromal fibroblasts. In all cases, histological examination of the mammoplasty specimens had previously revealed no pathological abnormalities.",
                                "In the nearly 70 co-engraftments with normal stromal fibroblasts, Applicants observed various normal epithelial outgrowths with all 10 organoid preparations. These outgrowths were very similar to those observed in the initial experiment. Different outcomes were seen, however, when primary fibroblasts were not mixed with the organoids prior to implantation,. Implantation of seven of the ten organoid preparations resulted in the formation of normal mammary epithelial structures albeit with somewhat stunted development. In contrast, after implanting ostensibly normal organoids from the remaining three women, Applicants observed abnormal human mammary epithelial structures (FIG. 5A, B). These structures are similar to commonly observed benign human breast proliferations, specifically hyperplastic ductal epithelia. Since Applicants had never observed these hyperplasias in co-engraftments with normal stromal fibroblasts, they concluded that normal primary fibroblasts are capable of suppressing hyperplastic growths that might be generated by preexisting marginally abnormal MECs present in the mammoplasty specimens.",
                                "These experiments strongly suggested a critical role for the stroma in controlling mammary epithelial outgrowth. Accordingly, Applicants speculated that further differences between different preparations of organoids if the stromal environment of the engrafted human organoids was perturbed. Thus, stromal cells in normal and neoplastic mammary glands are known to produce certain growth factors that affect the behavior of closely apposed epithelial cells. Consequently, Applicants modified the humanized stroma by forcing the RMF/EG fibroblasts to express either human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or human transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21) prior to using them to humanize the stroma. In mouse mammary glands, overexpression of HGF is known to result in increased branching of the mammary ducts and in a generalized hyperproliferation of the epithelium (Soriano et al. J Cell Sci. 1995;108:413-430). In contrast, TGF-\u03b2 overexpression inhibits proliferation of MECs (Ewan et al Am J Pathol. 2002;160:2081-2093) but promotes alterations in the stroma, including the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, the induction of neoangiogenesis, and other responses associated with wound-healing (Barcellos-Hoff et al. Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia. 1998;3:165-175; Barcellos-Hoff M et al. Cancer Research. 1993;53:3880-3886). Both of these growth factors are known to be synthesized by mammary stromal cells and are found to be overexpressed in the stroma of human breast cancers (Liotta et al. Nature. 2001;411:375-379; Jin et al. Cancer. 1997;79:749-760).",
                                "Cleared mammary fat pads were humanized with RMF/EG fibroblasts that overexpress either HGF or TGF\u03b2, or a mixture of both types of fibroblasts. Subsequently, human mammary epithelial organoids prepared from the 10 previously used reduction mammoplasty samples were introduced either directly into these growth factor-enriched fat pads or were mixed with normal primary stromal fibroblasts prior to implantation into the growth factor-enriched fat pads. When mixed with normal primary fibroblasts, Applicants observed normal acini, terminal ductal lobular units (TDLU), and even some ductal outgrowths from the organoids obtained from all 10 patient samples; these structures were very similar to those observed previously when these cells were implanted in humanized stroma that was not engineered to release either of these growth factors.",
                                "When the 10 organoid preparations were implanted directly into the growth factor-enriched stromal environment (and thus without prior admixture of normal stromal fibroblasts), 9 of the 10 preparations yielded poorly developed, stunted ductal structures. Surprisingly, this was the case for the 3 samples that had yielded ductal hyperplasias in the previous experiment. While the precise reasons for this disparity are unclear, these experiments indicate the importance of the stromal environment in regulating organoid growth.",
                                "One of the 10 reduction mammoplasty specimens behaved quite differently. In this particular case, as described above, cleared fat pads had been humanized with fibroblasts that overexpressed either HGF (12 mammary fat pads), or TGF\u03b2 (8 mammary glands), or a mixture of both types of growth factor-overexpressing fibroblasts (16 mammary glands). When primary human breast fibroblasts were mixed with the organoids from this patient prior to engraftment into growth factor-enriched humanized fat pads, normal breast outgrowths were observed in all of the 18 mammary glands (6 HGF mammary glands, 4 TGF\u03b2 mammary glands and 8 HGF+TGF\u03b2 mixed mammary glands) (FIG. 5C).",
                                "However, when the organoids from this patient were introduced directly into the growth factor-enriched, humanized stroma (6 HGF mammary fat pads, 4 TGF\u03b2 mammary glands, 8 HGF+TGF\u03b2 mammary glands) without admixed primary human stromal fibroblasts, the engrafted MECs developed into growths that closely resembled human ductal carcinomas, including both comedo-type and basal-type carcinomas (FIGS. 5D and 5E). Indeed, carcinomatous growths were seen in all 16 mammary glands (18 less 2 as one TGF\u03b2-humanized animal died prematurely). These tumors were invasive and some were poorly differentiated. Interestingly, in one engrafted mammary gland derived from organoids of this patient, in which the stroma had been humanized with HGF-overexpressing fibroblasts, all of the presumed stages of human breast cancer progression, including hyperplastic ducts, carcinomas in situ, and even invasive carcinomas, could be observed in a single microscope field (FIG. 4F). These tumors were subjected to various immunohistological analyses that confirmed their transformed and invasive phenotypes. There were no significant differences in the histology of the tumors that developed in the fat pads that were humanized with TGF\u03b2 alone compared to the HGF or the TGF\u03b2 plus HGF fibroblasts. In addition, all of the tumors were confirmed to be of human origin, as ascertained by genomic FISH.",
                                "In this experiment, 16 out of 18 mammary gland grafts derived from this preparation of mammoplasty organoids yielded hyperplastic and neoplastic outgrowths. However, when Applicants attempted to reproduce these histopathological abnormalities using organoids prepared from the same patient's mammoplasty sample but from a different region of the original mammoplasty tissue sample, they were unable to do so. We attribute this to inter-regional differences in the biology of various cell populations that preexisted within this breast tissue prior to mammoplasty.",
                                "To ensure that the epithelial preparation that gave rise to tumors was indeed from the presumed reduction mammoplasty sample, DNA fingerprinting was performed on tissue sections from the tumor tissues, and organoid preparations from the same patient sample as well as from six other patient samples. In this analysis, eight different chromosomal regions were examined from DNA isolated from the various patient and tissue samples. The microsatellite markers from the tumor tissues and the organoid preparation from the same patient were all identical; and, as anticipated, these differed from the markers associated with the DNAs of the six other patients. Therefore, the tumor phenotype was not the result of contaminating cells from another source.",
                                "Taken together, these observations indicate that an altered stromal environment can promote human breast cancer formation by abnormal cells that are present in the normal human breast and elude detection by normal histopathological screening. We speculate that these abnormal cells had already undergone one or several of the steps of tumor progression prior to their excision through mammoplasty. These histological abnormalities, evaluated independently by two breast cancer pathologists, left us with a single clear conclusion: that the mammary gland reconstruction procedure, as described here, can, under certain conditions, allow the formation of many of the steps of human breast cancer progression, including ductal hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma."

                                "In attempts to re-create breast tissues in mice, previous studies have attempted to introduce tissue fragments or dissociated MECs into the cleared mouse mammary fat pads of immunocompromised mice (Outzen et al. J Natl Cancer Inst. 1975; 55:1461-1466; Sheffield et al. Int J of Cancer. 1988;41:713-719). These attempts were unsuccessful in re-creating functional, properly differentiated breast tissues, presumably due to the inadequate stromal environment provided by the mouse mammary fat pad.",
                                "The success of the irradiated fibroblasts in enabling co-introduced unirradiated fibroblasts to survive and colonize the mammary gland appears to be related to the highly activated microenvironment that is created by these irradiated cells; this microenvironment is characterized by remodeling of the extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins of the adipose stroma, including increased collagen synthesis and activation of TGF\u03b2 ( Barcellos-Hoff et al. Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia. 1998; 3:165-175; Barcellos-Hoff M et al. Cancer Research. 1993; 53:3880-3886; Barcellos-Hoff et al. Radiat Res. 1998; 150:S109-S120). These activities are associated with an activated stromal response and are known to be correlated with fibrosis, invasion, motility and neoangiogenesis in vivo. Due to the high rate of cell death associated with irradiation of fibroblasts, Applicants restricted the irradiation process to only a portion of the fibroblast population prior to engraftment, hoping that the activated irradiated fibroblasts would assist in the survival and engraftment of the non-irradiated fibroblasts within the mammary fat pad of mice\u2014an outcome that was indeed observed.",
                                "This humanized stromal environment is hospitable for the engraftment of the human breast epithelial cells in the form of organoids. Proper ductal morphogenesis is dependent on the admixture of primary normal breast fibroblasts to these organoids prior to engraftment into humanized fat pads. This could be due to the fact that in the absence of the co-mingled human fibroblasts, the engrafted human MECs are not initially juxtaposed closely to human stromal cells in the humanized fat pads, depriving them of the human signals they need for ductal elongation and differentiation.",
                                "It is worth noting that, as shown here, the systemic hormonal environment of NOD/SCID mice during puberty or pregnancy is sufficient to promote human MEC proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. The use of immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice rather than nude mice in these experiments may account for the fact that additional ectopic estrogen stimulation was not required for MEC proliferation in vivo, as has been reported previously (Parmar et al. Endocrinology. 2002;143:4886-4896). Unlike nude mice, whose reproductive system and thus hormonal environment is compromised (Kopf-Maier et al. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1990;116:229-231), NOD/SCID female mice are fertile with a fully-functional reproductive system. This indicates that the previously observed graft-host inter-species incompatibilities derive from paracrine heterotypic interactions rather than from incompatibilities in the systemic hormonal environment.",
                                "We have also demonstrated that histopathologically normal human breast tissues from reduction mammoplasty samples may not behave normally in the absence of a normal stromal environment. We observed this in 3 patient samples that gave rise to hyperplasias in the absence of admixed fibroblasts, and, more strikingly, in one patient sample that gave rise to the various stages of breast cancer progression following implantation without admixed fibroblasts into growth factor-activated, humanized stroma.",
                                "Given the rapidity with which these lesions and tumors formed (<8 weeks) and the minimal time they spent outside living tissue (<1 day), Applicants consider it highly unlikely that the human MECs acquired additional genetic alterations after being removed from human breasts and introduced into the immunocompromised mice. We therefore conclude that these human epithelial cells had already undergone one or several premalignant changes prior to their implantation into mice. These abnormal cells were not initially detected by routine histopathological analyses of the donor mammoplasty specimens, either because they were present in only a small proportion of the breast tissue or because their abnormal phenotypes could not be realized in the context of a normal mammary stromal environment.",
                                "The notion that occult pre-neoplastic or neoplastic cells exist in breast tissues from young and middle aged women that have not been diagnosed for breast cancer or in tissues obtained from reduction mammoplasties has been evaluated by others (Bhathal et al. Br J Cancer. 1985;51:271-278; Nielsen et al. Br J Cancer. 1987;56:814-819; Alpers et al. Hum Pathol. 1985; 16:796-807; Holst et al. Cancer Res. 2003;63:1596-1601). These histopathological studies have reported that breast tissues from women as early as in their 20s already contain various breast lesions including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the presumed precursor lesion of ductal carcinomas. Furthermore, evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations of critical growth-regulating genes, such as methylation of the p16INK4A gene promoter, can be detected in morphologically normal breast tissues (Holst et al. Cancer Res. 2003;63:1596-1601). Our results extend these previous reports and demonstrate, moreover, that factors released by stromal cells, together with the presumed preexisting changes in the human mammary epithelial cells, suffice to create outgrowths that are indistinguishable from invasive human breast carcinomas. Given the wide spectrum of epithelial histologies observed in these reconstructed human mammary glands, Applicants conclude that this experimental system provides a unique and novel way to study many of the steps of human breast cancer pathogenesis in vivo, and that, in the future, many of these steps can be mimicked by the genetic modification of the human epithelial or stromal cells prior to their engraftment into mice. Moreover, the construction of analogous models of other human epithelial tissues may also prove useful for understanding a variety of other human neoplasias."
