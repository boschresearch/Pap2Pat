    "abstract": "A method renders a model of an object by first acquiring, in an acquisition space, a reflectance field of the object. The reflectance field includes a set of reflectance images of the object and a point model of the object. The model is deformed in an object space to generate a deformed model. For each point of the deformed model in the object space, the set of the reflectance images is queried in the acquisition space to obtain reflectance coefficients for each point. Each point of the deformed model is then shaded according to the corresponding reflectance coefficients to generate an image of the object reflecting the deforming.",

                        "Visualization and animation of realistic 3D computer graphics models are important for many applications, such as computer games, movies, advertisement, and virtual environments. Generally, the following methods are used to reproduce a visual appearance of real objects: model-based rendering, image-based rendering, and hybrid rendering that uses both models and images.",
                        "In model-based methods, the reflectance properties of 3D objects are typically acquired by 3D photography. For explicit appearance models, a parametric bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is fit to the acquired image data. Parametric BRDFs can be rendered efficiently on graphics hardware. The underlying model can be animated and deformed using well-developed techniques, such vertex blending. However, parametric BRDFs cannot acquire many effects of real-world materials, such as translucency, inter-reflections, self-shadowing, and subsurface scattering.",
                        "On the other hand, image-based rendering is well suited to acquire and represent objects having a complex appearance. However, image-based rendering is restricted to viewpoints of the acquired images. The lack of a 3D model makes deformations and animations very difficult, if not impossible.",
                        "Consequently, hybrid methods have become very popular. Hybrid methods parameterize acquired images onto a 3D model. The 3D model is then used for new viewpoints and animation. This representation is commonly known as a surface light field.",
                        "However, surface light fields can only provide novel renderings with a fixed lighting that corresponds to the acquired images. That is a severe limitation when it is desired to render the object in a new environment or under dynamically changing lighting.",
                        "A better hybrid representation uses a surface reflectance field. The surface reflectance field expresses an appearance of an object for many possible lighting configurations. Objects with arbitrary reflectance properties can be rendered from any arbitrary viewpoint under new lighting.",
                        "However, up to now the deformation and animation of objects with reflectance fields has not been possible.",
                        "In general, animating an image-based or hybrid appearance representation requires a process to evaluate the image-based data to simulate varying object deformations.",
                        "It is a problem to preserve the visual appearance of the deformed object surface. In other words, the perceptual impression of material properties of the object under mutable lighting conditions needs to be preserved as the object is deformed.",
                        "Therefore, there is a need to animate an object with a surface reflectance field with arbitrary deformations.",
                        "The prior art for three-dimensional rendering generally describes methods that acquire object shape and appearance from images. Some 3D rendering methods fit a parametric BRDF model to the acquired appearance data. However, parametric BRDFs cannot represent many of the reflectance properties of real objects.",
                        "In contrast, image-based appearance representations make no assumptions about the reflection property of materials. A lumigraph combines a 3D model, e.g., a visual hull of the object, with an image-based representation. Images of the object are represented as a dense light-field, and the model is used to improve light-field interpolation, i.e., to minimize ghosting.",
                        "To reduce the amount of image data required, view-dependent texture mapping can be used. Texture mapping uses a simple model and sparse texture data. That method is effective despite an approximate 3D model. However, that method has some limitations for highly specular surfaces due to a relatively small number of textures.",
                        "Surface light fields are a more general and efficient representation because surface light fields parameterize the image data onto the model surface. Surface light fields can either be associated with an accurate, high-density model, or with coarse triangular meshes for objects with low geometric complexity.",
                        "Some methods compress the light field data such that the models can be rendered in real-time using graphics hardware. To improve the appearance of complex object silhouettes, surface light fields can be combined with view-dependent opacity data into opacity light fields.",
                        "Unstructured lumigraph rendering is an effective method for rendering both surface and opacity light fields. Although surface light fields are capable of reproducing important global effects such as inter-reflections and self-shadowing, those methods only show the object under fixed lighting.",
                        "To overcome that limitation, surface reflectance fields have been used. The surface reflectance field of an object represents radiant light reflected from a surface under many possible incident lighting conditions. In practice, the surface reflectance field is sampled sparsely, and the sparse samples are interpolated while rendering. To further reduce the amount of data, most prior art reflectance fields are acquired for a single view. For approximately planar model geometry and diffuse surfaces, the data can be compressed further by fitting a parametric function to the surface reflectance field.",

Thus, the shape of the object has to be acquired with a range scanning device, which is expensive, time consuming, and complex. Moreover, that method does not explicitly address appearance preservation under non-uniform deformations.",

                        "FIG. 1 shows the basic structures and operations of our invention 100. A surface reflectance field (SRF) 110 is generated for a 3D object 103 in an acquisition space 101, i.e., a coordinate system with respect to the real world. The SRF 110 includes a 3D model 111 and reflectance images 112 of the object. The model is deformed 120 to produce a deformed 3D model 113 in an object space 102, i.e., a coordinate system with respect to the object. A look-up function 130 is applied 141 to the reflectance images 112 according to the deformation to produce reflectance coefficients 142 that are used to shade 140 the deformed 3D model to generate an image 104. The deforming and shading can be performed in real-time to produce a deformation and animation of the object as a sequence of images, i.e., a video.",
                        "The 3D model 111 can be constructed in any manner. For example, the 3D model can be a visual hull acquired from silhouette images, or laser range data, and the like. The model can use a mesh of 2D polygons or discrete zero-dimensional points to represent a shape of a surface of the object 103. Alternatively, for objects having simple geometric shapes yet complex material properties (texture), e.g., balls, cubes, cylinders, the model can be represented parametrically. In any case, the model 111 specifies multiple points in 3D that represent the shape of the surface of the 3D object 103.",
                        "The reflectance images 112 can be acquired by a camera at various viewpoints and under varying directional lighting. We use hundreds of images. In order to preserve the appearance of the object, we interpolate the reflectance images 112 for each surface point of the model.",
                        "To shade 140 a particular point of the deformed model 113, we apply the look-up function 130 to the point, for a particular viewing direction and particular incident light. The point is shaded 140 by interpolating the reflectance images according to the viewing and lighting direction mapped back to the acquisition space 101.",

                        "Ignoring global light transport, the surface reflectance field 110 is a discrete sampling of bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) of the object 103, knowing neither the exact location of the surface, nor normals of the surface. Ignoring wavelengths and time, the BRDF is a scalar function BRDF(l, v). The finction describes the fraction of light that is reflected in the direction v as the surface of the object is lighted from the direction l.",
                        "Similar to the BRDF notation, we use the notation SRF(p, l, v) to denote the reflectance of the SRF for a deformed model point p, a light direction l, and a viewing direction v. This relationship preserves the appearance of the surface during deformation and animation of the surface reflectance field.",

This ensures that the reflected light originates from the same surface point with the same BRDF. Unfortunately, this condition can not be guaranteed, because the exact geometry of the object 103 is typically not known, i.e., the exact location of the points q and q* cannot be determined. However, it is a reasonable approximation to force the two viewing rays to intersect corresponding points of the model, because the model point p is very likely close to the object point q. This can be achieved by selecting \n\np:=\u03a8\u22121(p*). \u2003\u2003(3)",

The lighting direction l and the surface normal m at the object point q encloses the same angle \u03b3 as the lighting direction l* and the normal m* at the deformed object point q*. This is a necessary condition to retain the reflectance characteristics of the object, as for example, the shape of the reflectance lobes of the corresponding BRDF. The same condition applies for the viewing directions v and v*. Preserving the shape of the reflectance lobes requires preservation of the angle between the directions l* and v* as well.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 3, the bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) describes the fraction of light from l that is reflected towards v. The spatial characteristics of a BRDF can be preserved by preserving the angles \u03c51, \u03c5v, and \u03b3 when changing to the acquisition space. Anisotropic materials require the preservation of the azimuthal orientations \u03c6l and \u03c6v relative to the surface frame. The angles \u03c6l and \u03c6v are relative to the surface normal m. In the SRF, the normal m is not known exactly. Instead, the model normal n is taken as an approximation.",

                                "As the point p follows immediately from Equation 3, the mapping (p*, l*, v*)(l, v) needs to be determined. The mapping can be expressed as a locally affine mapping \n\nLp*:(l*, v*)(l, v) \u2003\u2003(4) \n\n of lighting and viewing directions in the vicinity of the point p*. Note, that the mapping Lp* is a function of p*.",
                                "According to the second condition above, the look-up function Lp* needs to be angle preserving. By convention, the directions l, v, l*, and v* are unit vectors. Therefore, the function Lp* also needs to be length preserving. This implies that the function Lp* is an isometry, as a function of the location of point p*.
