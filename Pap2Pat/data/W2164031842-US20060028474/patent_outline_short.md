# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to computer graphics

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate visualization and animation
- discuss limitations of model-based and image-based rendering
- introduce surface reflectance fields

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce method for rendering deformed surface reflectance fields

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

- describe figures of the invention

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

- describe surface reflectance field generation and deformation

### Approximate BRDF Preservation

- motivate BRDF preservation
- limitations of exact object geometry and material properties
- introduce look-up function L
- enforce appearance preservation by three conditions
- define condition 1: intersecting viewing rays
- define condition 2: preserving reflectance characteristics
- define condition 3: preserving anisotropic BRDFs
- decompose look-up function L into translation and rotation
- introduce local model parameterization
- reconstruct rotation Lp* during rendering
- apply look-up function L for shading

## EFFECT OF THE INVENTION

- summarize invention benefits
