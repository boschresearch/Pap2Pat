    "abstract": "Methods and systems for evaluating and enhancing a neural network model include constructing a surrogate model that corresponds to a target neural network model, based on a degree of knowledge about the target neural network model. Adversarial attacks against the surrogate model are generated, based on an attack goal, a level of attacker capability, and an attack model. The target neural network model is tested for accuracy under the generated adversarial attacks to determine a degree of robustness of the target neural network. Robustness of the target neural network model is enhanced by replacing facial occlusions in input images before applying the input images to the target neural network.",

                        "To address the possibility of adversarial attacks against facial recognition systems, the robustness of such systems may be evaluated and bolstered. Thus, existing facial recognition systems may be assessed to determine their vulnerability to intentionally damaging inputs. For those facial recognition systems that are found to be vulnerable, robustness may be enhanced, for example by processing input images to identify and remediate occlusions.",
                        "Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary monitored environment 100 is shown. The environment 100 shows two regions, including an uncontrolled region 102 and a controlled region 104. It should be understood that this simplified environment is shown solely for the sake of illustration, and that realistic environments may have many such regions, with differing levels of access control. For example, there may be multiple distinct controlled regions 104, each having different sets of authorized personnel with access to them. In some embodiments, regions may overlap.",
                        "A boundary is shown between the uncontrolled region 102 and the controlled region 104. The boundary can be any appropriate physical or virtual boundary. Examples of physical boundaries include walls and rope\u2014anything that establishes a physical barrier to passage from one region to the other. Examples of virtual boundaries include a painted line and a designation within a map of the environment 100. Virtual boundaries do not establish a physical barrier to movement, but can nonetheless be used to identify regions with differing levels of control. A gate 106 is shown as a passageway through the boundary, where individuals are permitted to pass between the uncontrolled region 102 and the controlled region 104.",
                        "A number of individuals are shown, including unauthorized individuals 108, shown as triangles, and authorized individuals 110, shown as circles. Also shown is an attacker 112, shown as a square. The unauthorized individuals 108 are permitted access to the uncontrolled region 102, but not to the controlled region 104. The authorized individuals are permitted access to both the uncontrolled region 102 and the controlled region 104. The attacker 112 is seeks to undermine the efficacy of the facial recognition system, for example by providing visual inputs that affect the facial recognition model being used.",
                        "The environment 100 is monitored by a number of video cameras 114. Although this embodiment shows the cameras 114 being positioned at the gate 106, it should be understood that such cameras can be positioned anywhere within the uncontrolled region 102 and the controlled region 104. The video cameras 114 capture live streaming video of the individuals in the environment, and particularly of those who attempt to enter the controlled region 104.",
                        "The video streams generated by the video cameras 114 may be processed to identify objects within the frames of the video streams. Although face detection is specifically described herein, it should be understood that any kind of processing may be performed, for example to identify vehicles, license plates, animals, etc. The detected object may be compared to objects in a watchlist. In the case of faces, a similarity metric may be used to compare a detected face from a frame of the video streams to a set of different faces that are stored in the watchlist.",
                        "Facial recognition systems can solve various tasks, such as face identification and face verification. Face identification returns an identity associated with a given face, while face verification indicates whether a given face has the same identity as a stored face image. Face recognition problems can further be categorized into closed-set and open-set problems, depending on whether all testing identities are predefined in the training data.",
                        "In closed-set face recognition systems, all testing samples' identities are known in advance. In this scenario, face identification can be expressed as a multi-class classification problem, where face verification is an extension of face identification and classification is performed twice, with the predicted identity being compared to the identity of the stored face.",
                        "In contrast, for an open-set scenario, there may be no overlap between identities in the training data and the testing set. In this context, face verification may be expressed as a metric learning problem, which may be solved by training a feature extractor that maps faces into a discriminative feature space and that then evaluates the distance between feature vectors of the test face and the stored face image. The face identification of open-set face recognition may be an extension of face verification, by comparing the similarities between the feature vector of the test face and each face in a gallery of stored face images.",
                        "In an adversarial attack, the attacker 112 introduces inputs that have been selected to be recognized incorrectly by the facial recognition model. When such inputs are used for training, they can result in a model that misclassifies faces, potentially allowing the attacker 112 to appear to be an authorized individual in some cases, and in other cases frustrating the detection of the attacker as a person on a watchlist. The malicious data may be inserted into a training data corpus ab initio, or may be introduced during the use of a system that performs online training.",
                        "At least two types of adversarial attacks may be used against machine learning systems. A poising attack may be performed at the time of training, such that the machine learning system is trained incorrectly, resulting in a system that makes incorrect predictions on certain samples once the model is deployed. A decision-time attack may be performed after the machine learning system has been deployed. While the present embodiments are described in the context of a decision-time attack, it should be understood that the present principles may be applied to other types of attack as well.",
                        "In particular, an attacker 112 may introduce malicious data that takes advantage of occlusion to trick the facial recognition model. In particular, physical attacks may modify physical objects, such as by wearing a mask. Such attacks may modify the actual entity, rather than digital features, should have the effect of fooling a target model, and should avoid detection, for example by adding an unsuspicious perturbation to a physical object. Wearing a mask may, for example, cause the model to fail to recognize a face, or may cause the model to recognize the face as belonging to a different person. Other types of modifications can include sunglasses/eyeglasses and makeup. Different facial recognition models may have different degrees of resistance, or robustness, to these kinds of attack. This robustness can be characterized along the following dimensions:",
                        "Attacker's knowledge of the target system 212. This dimension represents information regarding a face recognition system that is accessible to the attacker 112. Specifically, an attacker 112 may have different degrees of knowledge of the target system such as: a) Zero knowledge, where the attacker 112 has only black-access to the target system; b) The training set, where the attacker 112 has access to the target system's training data; c) The neural architecture, where the attacker 112 has access to the neural network architecture of the target system; or d) Full knowledge, where the attacker has complete information on the target system, including the training set and the neural architecture.",
                        "Another dimension of generating attacks may direct the attacks toward various goals 214. In one, dodging attacks may be generated that make it more difficult for the facial recognition system to recognize the attacker 112. In another, impersonation attacks may be generated that cause the attacker to be misidentified as a specific other person.",
                        "In a third dimension, the attacker's capabilities 216 may vary. In one type of capability, the attacker 112 can produce an individual attack for each image. In another, the attacker can produce a universal attack for a batch of photos. An attack model that addresses the latter, for example to perform a pixel-level dodging attack on a closed-set system uses a parameter N to control a number of people who can share a common perturbation to fool the target system:",

For example, each input face image may have 224\u00d7224 pixels. In this illustrative example, (a, b)=(8,16) and (c, d)=(80,160). The face mask \u03b4\u2032 may be applied to a background image, such that the pixels in the rectangular area are set to be equal to the values of \u03b4\u2032, and those outside the face mask area have values of 0.",

There exist different neural network structures as well, such as a convolutional neural network, a maxout network, etc., which may vary according to the structure and function of the hidden layers, as well as the pattern of weights between the layers. The individual layers may perform particular functions, and may include convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, softmax layers, or any other appropriate type of neural network layer.

The error relative to the training data is then processed in \u201cbackpropagation\u201d computation, where the hidden neurons 504 and input neurons 502 receive information regarding the error propagating backward from the output neurons 506. Once the backward error propagation has been completed, weight updates are performed, with the weighted connections 508 being updated to account for the received error. It should be noted that the three modes of operation, feed forward, back propagation, and weight update, do not overlap with one another.

Discrepancies between the output of the ANN and the known output that is associated with that particular input are used to generate an error value, which may be backpropagated through the ANN, after which the weight values of the ANN may be updated.
