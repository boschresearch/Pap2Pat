# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a method for sensing a plant hormone released when a plant is infected with a disease, and a method for early detection of disease infection in a plant.

## BACKGROUND ART

It is known that plants have their own defense mechanisms that work against infection by pathogens such as filamentous fungi, feeding damage by insect pests and others, and stress due to environmental changes. Specifically, when plants are infected by pathogens, they synthesize salicylic acid, a signal substance, at the site of infection. Then, salicylic acid moves through the plant body via the sieve tube tissue and induces defense mechanisms in uninfected tissues, resulting in the development of systemic resistance to pathogens (systemic acquired resistance). Also, when plants undergo feeding damage by insect pests, they synthesize ethylene and jasmonic acid, which, in the same manner as salicylic acid, move through the plant body and induce defense mechanisms systemically (induced systemic resistance). Furthermore, it is known that plants adapt to environmental stress by synthesizing abscisic acid in the plant body in response to changes in the growth environment, such as drought, low temperature, and salt damage.

It is also known that, when plants are infected by pathogens or undergo feeding damage by insect pests, they have a mechanism to inform not only the damaged plants themselves but also the surrounding plants (Non-Patent Document 1). Specifically, salicylic acid, which is synthesized when infected by pathogens, is methylated to be methyl salicylate, which is released from the plants as a volatile signal substance to inform the surrounding plants of the pathogen infection, thus promoting defense mechanisms in advance. Jasmonic acid, which is synthesized at the time of damage by insect pests, is also known to be methylated to be methyl jasmonate, which is a volatile signal released from the plants, inducing resistance in the surrounding plants in advance.

As described above, it is known that plants release plant hormones as signal substances when they are damaged by diseases and insect pests, and sensing such signal substances as quickly as possible makes possible early detection of damage by diseases and insect pests.

As the method for early discovery of damage by sensing jasmonic acid released as a volatile signal at the time of insect pest damage, a method is disclosed in which a monitor plant with a luminescent protein gene is cultivated alongside a cultivated crop, and a phenomenon is utilized in which the monitor plant senses methyl jasmonate released and emits light when the crop undergoes damage by insect pests (Patent Document 1).

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

In some embodiments, tetraacetoxy diboroxane (TBO) may be used as the diboroxane derivative represented by general formula (2). In some embodiments, phenylboronic acid (PB) may be used as the phenylboronic acid derivative represented by general formula (3). In some embodiments, 2,4,6-triphenylboroxine acid (TPB) or 2,4,6-tris(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)boroxine (TFPB) may be used as the boroxine derivative represented by general formula (4).

The complex produced by the reaction of the compound having a specific structure that comprises a boron-oxygen bond and methyl salicylate newly exhibits fluorescence emission. Specifically, the complex formed by the reaction of the compound having a specific structure that comprises a boron-oxygen bond and methyl salicylate exhibits fluorescence emission by exposing it to excitation light with a wavelength of 200 to 400 nm. On the other hand, the compound having a specific structure that comprises a boron-oxygen bond alone does not exhibit fluorescence emission, which makes it possible to detect methyl salicylate.

### <Electrochemical Behavior>

The complex produced by the reaction of the compound having a specific structure that comprises a boron-oxygen bond and methyl salicylate exhibits electrochemical behavior that is different from that of the receptor, the compound having a specific structure that comprises a boron-oxygen bond. Specifically, a large change in current value occurs as measured for cyclic voltammetry of an electrochemical cell containing the complex formed by the compound having a specific structure that comprises a boron-oxygen bond and methyl salicylate.

The solution may contain tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate as a supporting electrolyte, for example, but the supporting electrolyte is not limited to this. In some embodiments, a step of comparing the detected change in current value with a predetermined reference value to determine the concentration of methyl salicylate may also be performed.

**[Quantitative Evaluation of Fluorescence Intensity]**

1 ml of a solution of TBO in acetonitrile (concentration 0.1 mol/L) and 1 ml of a solution of MSA in acetonitrile (concentration 0.1 mol/L) were added and diluted by 2000 times after 10 minutes, the solution was placed in a quartz cell, and its fluorescence spectrum was measured at an excitation wavelength of 348 nm, and consequently, a fluorescence spectrum curve shown in FIG. 10 was obtained. The peak wavelength at that time was 384 nm. Next, 0.9 ml of a solution of TBO in acetonitrile (concentration 0.1 mol/L) and 0.1 ml of a solution of MSA in acetonitrile (concentration 0.1 mol/L) were added and diluted by 2000 times after 10 minutes, the fluorescence spectrum was measured at an excitation wavelength of 348 nm, and the fluorescence intensity at a wavelength of 384 nm was determined. In the same manner, the fluorescence intensity with 0.8 ml of the TBO solution and 0.2 ml of the MSA solution, as well as the fluorescence intensity with 0.7 ml of the TBO solution and 0.3 ml of the MSA solution, was determined. FIG. 11 shows a plot of the obtained fluorescence intensities. From the results, it was found that, as the ratio of MSA is increased, the fluorescence intensity is also increased, indicating that MSA can be quantitatively detected.

**[Measurement of Electrochemical Behavior]**

An electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate as a supporting electrolyte in acetonitrile (concentration: 0.1 mol/L), 10 ml of the electrolyte solution was placed in a glass container, and an electrochemical cell having three electrodes, consisting of a working electrode, a counter electrode, and a reference electrode, was constituted. Note that glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. To this, 0.1 ml of a solution of TBO in acetonitrile (concentration: 0.1 mol/L) was added, and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured at room temperature (sweep potential: 0 to 2.2 V, sweep rate: 0.1 V/s).

Next, 0.1 ml of an acetonitrile solution (concentration: 0.1 mol/L) of methyl salicylate (MSA) was added to it, and the CV measurement was carried out in the same manner.

The obtained current-voltage curve (cyclic voltammogram) is shown in FIG. 12. The dashed line shows the measurement result of TBO alone, and the solid line shows the result after adding MSA to TBO. From these results, it was found that, after the addition of MSA, the current value is greatly changed in the region of a potential of 1.6 to 2.2 V compared to that before the addition. This indicates that methyl salicylate, a plant hormone, can be sensed through a change in current value, for example, by monitoring the current value flowing through the electrode at a voltage (1.6 to 2.2 V for Ag/Ag+ electrode) where the current value is greatly changed before and after the addition of MSA.

**[Measurement of Electrochemical Behavior]**

The measurement of cyclic voltammetry was carried out in the same manner as in Example 7 except that, instead of using an acetonitrile solution of methyl salicylate, 0.1 ml of an acetonitrile solution (concentration: 0.1 mol/L) of methyl jasmonate (MJA), which is a plant hormone released when a plant is damaged by an insect pest, was added. The obtained results are shown in FIG. 13. The dashed line shows the measurement result of TBO alone, and the solid line shows the result after adding MJA to TBO. From these results, it was found that there is no voltage region where the current value is greatly changed before and after the addition of MJA.

From Example 7 and Comparative Example 5, it was revealed that methyl salicylate can be selectively sensed by TBO, also in an electrochemical manner.
