                        "Cancer diagnosis and treatment plans are driven by multiple streams of data, which are acquired from several modalities, such as radiology scans, molecular profiling, histology slides, and clinical variables. Each one characterizes tumor biology along a different dimension and collectively enables clinicians to optimize therapeutic approach and estimate patient prognosis. Advances in molecular profiling techniques have enabled omics data mining for multi-gene predictors, bringing precision medicine to the forefront of clinical practice. More recently, computational techniques in the field of radiology are also being investigated to identify imaging based-phenotypes of treatment response and patient survival. Such approaches leverage large sets of explicitly designed image features or entail the discovery of image patterns by optimizing the predictive performance of a highly parameterized deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Along similar lines, the digitization of histopathology slides has opened new avenues for tissue-based assays that can stratify patients by risk from H&E slide images alone.",
                        "Despite showing some promise, these different modalities are implemented individually. There is a need to explore the complementary nature of these various modalities in a comprehensive clinical assessment. In particular, we believe there is a need provide a combinational approach in a quantitative, machine learning setting in the hopes of yielding a more confident prediction of patient outcomes than is currently achievable in isolated, unimodal analysis."

                        "In various embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed determining a multimodal biomarker indicating a prognostic prediction for a tumor sample, a prognostic prediction such as an overall patient survival likelihood. In various examples, systems and methods include obtaining datasets collected from a tumor sample across different data capture modalities. These data capture modalities may be image-based modalities, such as a radiomic image modality and/or a pathology image modality, and these data capture modalities may be molecule-based modalities, such as a molecular modality. In some examples, other data capture modalities may be used as well to provide datasets, including clinical modalities that provide clinical data on a patient/subject. The systems and methods herein may include providing different modality datasets to a trained deep learning framework and generating, using the trained deep learning framework, embedding predictions corresponding to each modality dataset. These embedding predictions may correspond to predictions of overall patient survival based on the data for of each data capture modality. The present techniques apply these embeddings to a deep fusion process of the trained deep learning framework, where that deep fusion process generates multimodal embedding predictions that are more accurate than the embedding predictions based on the individual modalities taken in isolation. For example, the trained deep learning framework may apply a loss minimization and embedding fusion process that generates multimodal embedding predictions, which can serve as a multidimensional biomarkers for the tumor sample.",
                        "Thus, in various examples, the present techniques include systems and methods of generating multidimensional biomarkers that are predictive of pathology outcomes, such as survival rates, by fusing predictions across different data capture modalities. The present techniques may be used, for example, to identify between different gliomas, subdividing their malignancy into histological grades II-IV, where the grades differ in morphology and molecular heterogeneity, which correspond to pathology outcomes such as treatment resistance and short-term recurrence. With the present techniques, as shown in example data discussed here, we can provide a quantitative analysis of glioma and its tumor habitat (or any other number cancer types) by combing medical image modality data with other modality data such as molecular image modality data and clinical modality data.",
                        "The systems and methods herein are able to provide considerable advantageous over conventional systems. For example, some have proposed techniques that integrate genomics data with pathology analysis via a convolution neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) for improved prognosis predictions in glioma patients. And some have integrated histology, clinical, and sequencing data by condensing each to a correlated prognostic feature representation. Others have introduced late-stage fusion approaches that incorporate feature-based representations from radiology with pathology features or genomic data to predict tumor recurrence. However, no conventional techniques combine different modality datasets (e.g., radiology, pathology, and genomic data) within a single deep learning framework for outcome prediction. Further, no conventional techniques deploy loss minimization and multidimensional fusion processes for improved outcome predictions."

For example, the radiomic and pathology image datasets may be analyzed on a tile-basis, receiving the image datasets at a first image resolution, downsampling them to a second image resolution, and then performing a normalization on the downsampled image datasets, such as color and/or intensity normalization, and removing non-tissue objects from the image datasets, and then apply a tile mask to generate tiles representing sub-sections of the received radiomic and pathology image datasets.",

In some examples, the multidimensional fusion module 156 generates a number of multimodal embedding predictions and then applies a selection rule to identify one or a subset thereof as the multimodal embedding prediction for the received datasets. In some examples, the multidimensional fusion module 156 generates a multidimensional tensor fusion 159 of combinational relationships between embedding predictions.

The embedding module 210 may be configured in different machine learning architectures to implement the functions of the neural networks 212, 214, 216, and 218. In some examples, the networks are implemented at separate neural networks each identifying respective features and embeddings and/or embedding predictions for each respective dataset. In some examples, the outputs of the separate neural networks may be combined in a fully connected layer. In other examples, each of these networks may be implemented as one or more specific internal layers in a neural network, where those layers may include embedding layers and one or more fully connected layers.",

By way of example, image features may include identified tissue type, cell type, size, shape, and intensity, tumor shape, tumor minimum shape and max shape, tumor area, tumor perimeter, tumor percentage, cell shape, cell area, cell perimeter, cell convex area ratio, cell circularity, cell convex perimeter area, cell length, lymphocyte percentage, cellular characteristics, cell textures, including saturation, intensity, and hue. In some examples, these neural networks are trained to identify features as well as to generate the unimodal embeddings therefrom. In some examples, features are identified in the received modality datasets themselves and the neural networks are trained to generate the unimodal embeddings. In various examples, the neural networks 212, 214, 216, and 218 do not use all received features or generated features in determining the unimodal embedding predictions. In some examples, the embedding network 210 receives features from the modality datasets 204, 206, and 208 that are not used in determining the embeddings, and in some of these examples, such received features may be communicated to the loss minimization module 220 and/or embedding fusion module 226 and used to perform loss minimization, feature weighting, and embedded fusion to generate the multimodal embedding predictions not only from unimodal embeddings output from the neural networks 212, 214, 216, and 218, but additionally from other features not used in generating these embeddings.",

With the present techniques, efficient multimodal fusing of can be performed across image data, molecular data, and clinical data. Moreover, the multimodal fusion may be multidimensional, in that two or more different modality datasets may be combined. Moreover still, such multidimensionality allows for the deep learning framework to generate a set of embeddings that can be analyzed against each other to determine which are most accurate for prediction purpose.

Initially different modality datasets are received in a block 402 and the modality datasets are provided to the trained deep learning framework at a block 404. At a block 406, that deep learning framework determines unimodal embedding predictions, such as embeddings 308, 312, and 316, and, at a block 408, the deep learning framework imposes a multimodal orthogonalization loss process to these embeddings, reducing the number of embeddings to those with an orthogonal correlation to a predicted outcome. As shown in FIG. 3 this multimodal orthogonalization loss process can be applied between each of the different embedding predictions. Next, at a block 410, the deep learning framework applies a gating-based attention process across all the resulting embeddings from the loss process at block 408. This gating-based attention process imposes weighting factors on the resulting embeddings to allow for tensor fusion of the embeddings into various multimodal embeddings at a block 412. Each of the generated multimodal embeddings is a prediction of a state or outcome, such as patient survival. At a block 414, a rule is applied to rank the multimodal embeddings by risk score, e.g., by survival. For example, a maximum prediction score may be identified from the multimodal embeddings and that maximum score may be output as the multimodal embedding prediction. In other examples, an average prediction score may be output, or a prediction score corresponding to a given percentile value across all prediction scores (such as the prediction score at the 75th percentile of the generated prediction scores across all multimodal embedding predictions). In some of these various examples, the prediction scores for the unimodal embeddings are combined with the prediction scores of the multimodal embeddings to determine an output multimodal embedding prediction. In another example, the fusion model 226 may comprise an ensemble model for combining the scores from each model predictor of the multi-modal embeddings. Further aggregation may include, averaging, mean, min, max, or concatenation of the predictors. At a block 416, a report is generated of the identified multimodal embedding with the highest assurance score and/or of a tensor fusion of the various unimodal and multimodal embedding predictions generated by the foregoing processes.",

Broadly speaking, the deep learning frameworks herein may implement any suitable statistical model (e.g., a neural network or other model implemented through a machine learning process) that will be applied to each of the received image data, molecular data, and clinical data. As discussed herein, that statistical model may be implemented in a variety of manners. In some examples, machine learning is used to evaluate training images and develop classifiers that correlate predetermined image features to specific predictive outcomes, such as overall survival rate. In some examples, image features can be identified as training classifiers using a learning algorithm such as Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM) or other machine learning process. Once classifiers within the statistical model are adequately trained with a series of training images, a series of molecular datasets, or a series of clinical datasets, the statistical model may be employed in real time to analyze subsequent images, subsequent molecular datasets, or subsequent clinical datasets provided as input to the statistical model for determining a multidimensional biomarker and for predicting state or outcomes. In some examples, when a statistical model is implemented using a neural network, the neural network may be configured in a variety of ways. In some examples, the neural network may be a deep neural network and/or a convolutional neural network. In some examples, the neural network can be a distributed and scalable neural network. The neural network may be customized in a variety of manners, including providing a specific top layer such as but not limited to a logistics regression top layer.

A deep convolutional neural network can be considered as having a stacked structure with a plurality of layers. The neural network or other machine learning processes may include many different sizes, numbers of layers and levels of connectedness. Some layers can correspond to stacked convolutional layers (optionally followed by contrast normalization and max-pooling) followed by one or more fully-connected layers. For neural networks trained by large datasets, the number of layers and layer size can be increased by using dropout to address the potential problem of overfitting. In some instances, a neural network can be designed to forego the use of fully connected upper layers at the top of the network. By forcing the network to go through dimensionality reduction in middle layers, a neural network model can be designed that is quite deep, while dramatically reducing the number of learned parameters. Further in examples herein, the neural network model may include at least attention gated layer, that applies attention weights to different features to increase their focus between layers.",

The introduction of a MMO loss component, which forces unimodal embeddings to provide independent and complementary information to the fused prediction, further improved prognostic performance of the deep orthogonal fusion.

Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components or multiple components.",
                                "Additionally, certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of routines, subroutines, applications, or instructions. These may constitute either software (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware. In hardware, the routines, etc., are tangible units capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.",
                                "In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a microcontroller, field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.",

Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.",

Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connects the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).",
