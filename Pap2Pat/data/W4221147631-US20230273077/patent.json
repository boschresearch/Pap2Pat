                        "The sensor 100 operates on the principle of an exceptional point. A exceptional point (EP) is a non-Hermitian spectral degeneracy where both eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Operation near an EP increases the responsivity of the sensor 100 due to the abrupt resonant detuning occurring in the proximity to the EP. The sensor 100 implements an EP-based parity time () symmetric electromechanical sensor that suppresses enhanced technical noise by enhanced responsivity to applied accelerations. The fundamental noise is mitigated by exploiting the detuning from an extrema degeneracy point with a nonlinear response to the force. The extrema degeneracy point may be a transmission peak degeneracy (TPD) when the output signal is a transmission signal. The degeneracy point may be a reflectance peak degeneracy (RPD) or a reflectance deep degeneracy (RDD) when the output signal is a reflectance signal. For ease of illustration, the following example discusses a TPD. A TPD forms when the sensor 100 is weakly coupled to the transmission line 109 as a sensitivity measurant. The TPD occurs at a particular frequency and controlled parameters for which the bi-orthogonal eigenbasis is still complete and are distinct from the EP.",
                        "EPs are spectral degeneracies occurring in the parameter space of an open (non-Hermitian) system where two N=2 (or more) eigenfrequencies and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. An EP induces a sublinear detuning of the resonant frequencies from the EP degeneracy when the system interacts with a perturbing agent, such as an applied force. Specifically, in the proximity of an N-th order EP, the degenerate resonances abide to Puiseux generalized expansions leading to a resonance detuning \u0394f\u2261|f\u2212fEP| that follows a nonlinear behavior, such as an N-th root behavior \u0394f\u02dc\u03f51/N with respect to the perturbation strength \u03f5 imposed to the system by the presence of the perturbing agent, for example, the applied force. In the small perturbation limit, this sublinear response provides an enhanced sensing as compared to a linear response (\u0394f\u02dc\u03f5<<\u03f51/N) in a sensing scheme that relies on Hermitian degeneracies.",
                        "The sensor 100 operates based on the distinction between EP and the TPDs observed in the transmission spectrum observed after interrogation via a weakly coupled transmission line 109. The corresponding differential transmission peaks detuning \u0394f from the TPD follows a square-root behavior with respect to the applied force 118, a, and has a detune rate slightly larger than the rate appearing in the resonant modes detuning near EPs. While the TPD is a consequence of the underlying EP, it occurs at different parameter values of the sensor 100 where the eigenbasis is still complete; thus the performance of the sensor is not influenced by excess noise effects that are rooted to the eigenbasis collapse. However, at the proximity of the TPD, the Peterman Factor (PF) remains finite and smaller than a sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) of the sensor measuring the responsivity of the sensor 100 to acceleration variations. It has been determined theoretically that the PF is directly proportional to the technical noise due to the coupling with the transmission line and the noise generated by the gain/loss elements used to create the EP-singularity. Corresponding noise enhancement factors describing the noise power enhancements remain finite in the proximity of the TPD and are surpassed by the SEF of the transmission peaks detuning near the TPD.",

                        "When the capacitive coupling is above a critical value CcEP, the system is in so-called exact phase where the corresponding normal modes are also eigenvectors of the -symmetric operator. In the opposite limit (small coupling) the system is in the broken phase where the normal modes are no longer eigenmodes of the  symmetric operator. In the latter case, the eigenfrequencies appear as a complex conjugate pair, while in the former domain they are real-valued. The two phases are separated by an EP singularity of order=2.

                        "FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating a density plot of the measured normalized transmittance spectrum as a function of acceleration, a, in accordance with some embodiments. In the density plot shown in FIG. 5, the measured (normalized) transmittance spectrum, T(f; a), versus the applied differential in-plane acceleration, a, is shown. At a=0, the transmission spectrum demonstrates a transmission peak degeneracy (TPD) which reflects the nearby EP degeneracy of the eigenfrequencies of the isolated system (corresponding to Ce=0). The system is initially set at TPD conditions with the conductive plates 216, 220 of the sensing unit 212 being at a distance d\u224820 \u03bcm from one another corresponding to CcTPD\u224850 pF. As the applied differential in-plane acceleration, a, increases, the capacitive coupling detunes from its equilibrium value, CcTPD, due to a displacement of the body member 206 to a new equilibrium position. The working principle of the sensor 100 relies on detecting concomitant transmission peak shifts from the TPD due to the capacitive coupling detuning from CcTPD. The transmittance develops two equihight peaks which bifurcate from the TPD following a characteristic square-root behavior, as indicated by the line 502, evaluated using a coupled mode theory, expected from the Puiseux expansion of resonance frequencies around an EP represented by the line 504.",
