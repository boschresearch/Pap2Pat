    "abstract": "A computer-implemented method and a system for dating a blood pool lying on a substrate are described. The method comprises: determining, based on at least one picture of a blood pool lying on a substrate taken at a given time (t), the drying front of the blood pool at the given time (t); and determining, based on the determined drying front of the blood pool at the given time (t), and on a drying model, the time elapsed between the given time (t) and an initial time (t0) at which the blood pool initiated a drying process on the substrate. Determining the drying front of the blood pool comprises determining the wet perimeter (Pt) of the blood pool, and the drying model correlates the time elapsed with a blood's diffusion coefficient (Dblood) measured for a plurality of predetermined environmental conditions and a plurality of initial blood pool conditions.",

                        "Despite the recent development of forensic science, estimating bloodstain age has not yet been convincingly implemented in routine crime scene investigation. Current methods for estimating blood pools age rely on complex procedures requiring specialist knowledge and/or sophisticated, expensive machines, Spectroscopy-based techniques and hyperspectral imaging are currently the techniques closest to implementation due to their widespread availability. However, both types of techniques suffer from low accuracy, are destructive and non-easily transportable on every crime scene.",
                        "The article by Laan et al., Morphology of drying blood pools, Forensic Sci. Int. 267, pages 104-109, 2016, attempts to characterize the drying process of blood pools and identifies different drying stages. However, this attempt represents only a very preliminary step towards the establishment of a predictive drying model ideally aimed at leading to an accurate determination of the time elapsed between a given time at which a blood pool is considered and a time at which the blood pool has been spread, Indeed, the various characteristics of a blood pool, such as for example the size and shape thereof, together with the variability of the environmental conditions, lead overall to a daunting challenge in establishing such drying model, since no apparent correlation exists that could weight all cited blood pool characteristics and environmental conditions.",
                        "The article by Choi et al., Highly sensitive and accurate estimation of bloodstain age using smartphone, Biosens. Bioelectron. 130, pages 414-419, 2019, describes a system for estimating the age of bloodstains that combines three analyses, namely blood pool analysis, crack ratio analysis and colorimetric analysis, which are all based on the image analysis of a bloodstain. Parameters are extracted from such image analysis and the extracted parameters are then compared to corresponding parameters of reference images stored in a database.",
                        "Another method for estimating the age of bloodstains is described in the article by Thanakiatkrai et al., Age estimation of bloodstains using smartphones and digital image analysis, Forensic Sci. Int. 233, pages 288-297, 2013. Such method is based on colorimetry and plots color parameters extracted from digital images of bloodstains against time, and then compares the results to a calibration curve. The effects of further parameters on the estimation, such as the type of smartphone camera, person-to-person variation, temperature, humidity, light exposure, anticoagulant, and substrate, are further discussed in the article.",
                        "All prior art methods merely provide rough age estimations, and lack a drying model reliably representing a blood pool's drying process. There thus still exists a need for a method offering a high accuracy and reliability in dating blood pools, while remaining simple to be implemented, not destructive or altering, and transferable on the field."

Likewise, in these embodiments, the wet perimeter at time t is sufficiently different from the wet perimeter at time t0.

According to one or more embodiments, the drying model may take account of the blood pool's size and/or shape, which are reflected by mathematical equations used in the modeling. For example, when one considers equation (8), correlation coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 may take into account the size of the blood pool.

However, according to one or more embodiments, the method may be specifically adapted to men or women. According to one or more embodiments, the method comprises the use of two databases, one male database specifically adapted to men and one female database specifically adapted to women.

For example, at a temperature of 23\u00b11\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 20%, for a white tile as substrate, such measurement provides 1.44 mm (\u00b10.19 mm) as the statistical value of the blood pool's height.",

                        "In this example of the method, the picture of the blood pool was taken only once. However, the taking of a predetermined number of pictures of the blood pool could have been envisaged in order to obtain an average value of the elapsed time \u03b4E. For example, in one or more embodiments of the present invention, the taking of a predetermined number of pictures can be done. Each repetition of such step can be followed by the repetition of the calculation of said elapsed time, thereby leading to the calculation of the elapsed time a predetermined number of times. At that point, an average value of the elapsed time may be obtained. According to one or more embodiments, such repetitions can be performed in an automated way, at a predetermined time interval, e.g. 1 picture being taken per minute during 10 minutes. In the above-detailed description, only one set of predetermined environmental and initial blood pool conditions is shown, which is associated with the value of Dblood measured in FIG. 4, i.e., for a blood pool drying at 20% humidity, T=23\u00b0 C.\u00b11\u00b0 C., on the same surface, a tile. However, the above-mentioned database, which comprises sets of predetermined environmental and initial blood pool conditions impacting the drying of blood pools associated with corresponding sets of measured blood pool parameters including blood's diffusion coefficients (Dblood) and blood pool's heights (h), may contain many more sets. FIG. 6 illustrates the interest of providing a rich database in the method according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. FIG. 6 is a diagram correlating KiLkL*0.5 with the percentage of water left in blood pools having the same mass (4.83\u00b10.026 g) and drying at different humidities (30%, 40%, 50%), at the same temperature T=21\u00b0 C.\u00b11\u00b0 C., on different substrates \u2018surfaces (varnished or unvarnished parquet). The different values of blood's diffusion coefficients Dblood corresponding to the plateau values observed in FIG. 6 are presented in Table 1."
