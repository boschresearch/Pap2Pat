# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a fused gene, a vector, a transgenic plant, a method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil, a method for constructing a transgenic plant, and a kit for constructing a transgenic plant.

Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2013-177774, filed Aug. 29, 2013, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

## BACKGROUND ART

Every year, one hundred million tons or more of vegetable fat or oil is used around the world for foods such as margarine, shortening, dressing, and hydrogenated edible oil, for fuels, or for industrial use such as lubricating oil or raw materials of surfactants. Due to the increase in the world population or the like, a demand for the vegetable fat or oil keeps increasing. The production of vegetable fat or oil focused on palm oil and soybean oil increased by about 1.5 times between 2001 and 2008. It is considered that the increase in production may result from the promotion of forestation, breed improvements, and the like in the main production areas such as Malaysia or Indonesia, or may be greatly affected by policies including grants that are implemented as the use of biodiesels is increasing, particularly in Europe.

However, for example, regarding palm oil or coconut oil, the area where the plants can be cultivated is limited to a partial area such as Southeast Asia, and biological diversity has to be protected. Because of these issues, it is not desirable for expansion of plantations due to deforestation, and there is a demand for increasing the production of fat or oil per unit plant.

Under the circumstances described above, the inventors of the present invention have developed a method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil by using plants cultivated in a phosphorus-deficient state or plants suffering from phosphorus deficiency (PTL 1). Furthermore, the inventors have developed a method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil by cultivating mutated plants in which starch biosynthesis is inhibited (PTL 2).

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

### Technical Problem

In the plants used in the methods for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil described in PTL 1 and 2, vegetable fat or oil could be accumulated more to a certain degree than in plants under normal conditions or wild-type plants.

The present invention has been made in consideration of the circumstances described above, and an object thereof is to provide a transgenic plant which makes it possible to efficiently manufacture vegetable fat or oil while continuing photosynthesis of the plant, a fused gene, a vector which makes it possible to construct the transgenic plant, a kit which includes the vector, a method for constructing the transgenic plant, and a method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil by cultivating the transgenic plant.

## DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS

<<Fused Gene>>

The fused gene of the present invention includes a nucleic acid sequence which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid and a phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence and controls the expression of the nucleic acid sequence.

To “affect the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” means increasing the amount of biosynthesized neutral lipid, increasing the accumulation amount of neutral lipid, or modifying the composition of neutral lipid. The neutral lipid may be any of monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol.

The “nucleic acid sequence which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” includes a nucleic acid sequence which exerts an influence as a nucleic acid such as by means of RNA interference (RNAi) and a nucleic acid which exerts an influence as a protein encoded by the nucleic acid sequence. That is, the nucleic acid sequence which is included in the fused gene of the present invention and affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid may be a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid. As the nucleic acid sequence, a DNA sequence is preferable.

The “nucleic acid sequence which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” or the “protein which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” refers to a nucleic acid or protein which can increase the amount of neutral lipid synthesized or accumulated in the entirety or any portion of a plant compared to the original amount of neutral lipid in the host, and a nucleic acid sequence or protein which can modify the composition of neutral lipid such that the neutral lipid has a composition different from the original composition thereof, by control of the expression of the nucleic acid or protein in a plant.

It is preferable that an expression control sequence included in the fused gene of the present invention and a structural gene sequence included in the fused gene of the present invention be derived from different genes.

In a biosynthesis pathway of neutral lipid, for example, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is synthesized through a reaction between glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and a fatty acid; phosphatidic acid (PA) is synthesized through a reaction between LPA and a fatty acid; diacylglycerol (DAG) is synthesized as a result of dephosphorylation of PA by phosphatidic acid phosphatase; and triacylglycerol is synthesized from DAG by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) or phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT). Therefore, preferred examples of the protein which can increase the amount of neutral lipid include DGAT or PDAT involved in the pathway described above.

That is, the protein which can increase the amount of neutral lipid synthesized and affects the biosynthesis of the neutral lipid is preferably a protein including an amino acid sequence of any of the following (a) to (d).

(a) A protein including an amino acid sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5

(b) A protein including an amino acid sequence which is obtained by the deletion, substitution, or addition of one to several amino acids in the amino acid sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5

(c) A protein including an amino acid sequence which shares identity of equal to or higher than 90% with the amino acid sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5 and has acyltransferase activity

(d) A protein including an amino acid sequence which shares identity of equal to or higher than 25% with the amino acid sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5, belonging to a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, and having acyltransferase activity

Furthermore, the protein which increases the amount of neutral lipid synthesized and affects the biosynthesis of the neutral lipid is preferably a protein which includes an amino acid sequence of any of the following (a) to (c), belongs to a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, and has acyltransferase activity.

(a) An amino acid sequence which is represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5

(b) An amino acid sequence which is obtained by the deletion, substitution, or addition of one to several amino acids in the amino acid sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5

(c) An amino acid sequence which shares identity of equal to or higher than 25% with the amino acid sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 5

A DGAT1 gene (AGI code: At2g19450) of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a protein including the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1. A DGAT2 gene (AGI code: At3g51520) of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a protein including the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 2. A DGAT3 gene (AGI code: At1g48300) of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a protein including the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3. A DGAT4 gene (AGI code: At3g26840) of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a protein including the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4. A PDAT gene (AGI code: At5g13640) of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a protein including the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5.

The DGAT gene and the PDAT gene include a PLN02401 domain, an LPLAT_MGAT_Like domain, a PLN02517 domain, or an MBOAT superfamily motif, which are assumed to be involved in the acyltransferase activity.

Examples of (b) described above include a protein having a mutation (deletion, insertion, substitution, or addition) in a region other than the aforementioned domains or a protein having a mutation which occurs in the aforementioned domains and retains the acyltransferase activity.

Herein, the number of amino acids which may be deleted, inserted, substituted, or added is preferably 1 to 30, preferably 1 to 20, more preferably 1 to 10, and still more preferably 1 to 5.

(c) or (d) described above is an amino acid sequence which preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 25%, 40%, or 50%, more preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 60%, 70%, or 80%, even more preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 90% or 95%, and particularly preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 98% with the amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 3.

It is preferable that the identity be within the above range for the following reasons, for example. CrDGAT1 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represented by SEQ ID NO: 21 is an orthologue of AtDGAT1 of Arabidopsis thaliana, and the amino acid sequences thereof share identity of 60%.

Furthermore, CrDGTT1 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represented by SEQ ID NO: 22 is an orthologue of AtDGAT2 of Arabidopsis thaliana, and is known to retain the acyltransferase activity (Hung et al. 2013 FEBS let, Sanjaya et al. 2013 Plant Cell). The amino acid sequence identity shared between CrDGTT1 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and AtDGAT2 of Arabidopsis thaliana is 29%.

In addition, the orthologues retaining the acyltransferase activity share identity with the following genes, for example.

The amino acid sequence identity shared between CrDGTT2 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represented by SEQ ID NO: 23 and AtDGAT2 of Arabidopsis thaliana is 31%.

The amino acid sequence identity shared between CrDGTT3 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represented by SEQ ID NO: 24 and AtDGAT2 of Arabidopsis thaliana is 35%.

The amino acid sequence identity shared between CrDGTT4 of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represented by SEQ ID NO: 25 and AtDGAT2 of Arabidopsis thaliana is 35%.

The amino acid sequence identity shared between CrPDAT of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii represented by SEQ ID NO: 26 and AtPDAT of Arabidopsis thaliana is 31%.

Likewise, examples of genes encoding the aforementioned proteins that can increase the amount of neutral lipid include genes which are composed of one of the following DNA and encode proteins having acyltransferase activity.

The following base sequences represented by SEQ ID NOS: 6 to 10 are base sequences of a DGAT1 gene, a DGAT2 gene, and a PDAT gene of Arabidopsis thaliana respectively.

(d) DNA including a base sequence represented by one of SEQ ID NOS: 6 to 10

(e) DNA including a base sequence which preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 25%, 40%, or 50%, more preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 60%, 70%, or 80%, even more preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 90%, and particularly preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 98% with the base sequence represented by one of SEQ ID NOS: 6 to 10

(f) DNA including a base sequence which can be hybridized with DNA including a base sequence complementary to the DNA including the base sequence represented by one of SEQ ID NOS: 6 to 10 under stringent conditions

Examples of the proteins that can increase the amount of neutral lipid include phospholipase D, which is a membrane lipid lipase(there is a report regarding PLD α1 in Liu et al 2014 BMC Plan Biol), wrinkled 1 (WRI1), which is a transcription factor positively controlling fatty acid synthesis, an MYB-type transcription factor (there is a report regarding GmMYB73 in Liu et al 2014 BMC Plant Biol.), LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) (Kim et al 2013 FEBS Open Bio), and the like. TAG lipase SDP1, which negatively controls fatty acid synthesis, and GLABRA2 (GL2), which is a transcription factor negatively controlling the expression amount of PLD α1, can also increase the amount of neutral lipid by a method of negatively controlling the expression of the proteins.

Examples of the protein which can modify the composition of neutral lipid include a fatty acid elongase, a fatty acid desaturase, and the like. Specific examples thereof include acyl-ACP thioesterase genes (FATA and FATB) and oleic acid desaturase genes (FAD2 and FAD3).

Examples of the nucleic acid sequence which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid include sequences of an RNA interference (RNAi)-inducing nucleic acid, an antisense nucleic acid, and ribozyme for any one or more factors selected from the group consisting of a TAG lipase, the aforementioned GL2, a fatty acid elongase, and a fatty acid desaturase.

The “phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence which controls the expression of the nucleic acid sequence” included in the fused gene of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a sequence which can change the expression of the nucleic acid sequence, whose expression can be controlled by the control sequence, in response to the phosphorus-deficient state. The control sequence includes an enhancer domain, a promoter sequence, and the like and is preferably a promoter sequence. To be “operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence” means that the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence is disposed so as to control the expression of the nucleic acid sequence. To “control the expression” means not only the act of increasing the expression but also the act of exerting an influence such as decreasing the expression and shifting the expression timing. Herein, to “control the expression of the nucleic acid” includes the expression of a nucleic acid such as mRNA, miRNA, antisense RNA, or siRNA derived from the nucleic acid sequence and the expression of a protein translated by the nucleic acid sequence.

The phosphorus deficiency-responsive promoter sequence can be investigated by a known reporter assay using a reporter gene. The reporter gene is not particularly limited as long as the expression thereof can be detected, and examples thereof include GUS, GFP, and the like that are generally used by those skilled in the art.

Whether a promoter sequence is responsive to phosphorus deficiency can be checked by the following method, for example. A transgenic plant having a base sequence which is bonded to the downstream of the promoter sequence such that the expression of a reporter gene sequence can be controlled is constructed; the transgenic plant is cultivated in media containing phosphorus at various concentrations; and the expression of the reporter gene in the plant is detected. At this time, the normal phosphorus concentration in media used for comparison is within a range of 0.1 mM to 1 mM, for example. Furthermore, as the investigation method, the following method is used, for example. An expression level of the reporter gene in the plant cultivated at the normal phosphorus concentration is compared with an expression level of the reporter gene in the plant cultivated at a phosphorus concentration lower than the normal phosphorus concentration, and a promoter sequence showing a high expression level in the plant cultivated at low phosphorus concentration is selected.

Specifically, examples of the phosphorus deficiency-responsive promoter sequence include sequences of promoters of a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene, a phospholipase C gene, a phospholipase D gene, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase gene, a sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene, a UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase gene, an SQDG synthase gene, and a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene.

More specifically, examples of the phosphorus deficiency-responsive promoter sequence include promoter sequences of the following genes derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, such as a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 11) of a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase 2 (MGD2) gene (AGI code: At5g20410), a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 12) of an MGD3 gene (AGI code: At2g11810), a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 13) of a phospholipase C5 (NPC5) gene (AGI code: At3g03540), a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 14) of a phospholipase D ζ2 (zeta 2) (PLD ζ2) gene (AGI code: At3g05630), a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 15) of a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 1 (PAH1) gene (AGI code: At3g09560), a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 16) of a UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase (SQD1) gene (AGI code: At4g33030), a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 17) of an SQDG synthase (SQD2) gene (AGI code: At5g01220), and a promoter sequence (SEQ ID NO: 18) of a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 3 (UGP3) gene.

Examples of the phosphorus deficiency-responsive promoter sequence also include a promoter sequence which preferably shares identity of, for example, equal to or higher than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 88%, more preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 90%, and even more preferably shares identity of equal to or higher than 98% with the base sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 11 to 18 or with a partial sequence of the base sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 11 to 18 that is responsive to phosphorus deficiency and can control the expression of the nucleic acid sequence affecting the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid. The examples also include a promoter sequence including a base sequence which can be hybridized under stringent conditions with DNA including the complementary base sequence of the base sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 11 to 18 or with DNA which includes complementary base sequence of a partial sequence of the base sequence represented by any of SEQ ID NOS: 11 to 18, is responsive to phosphorus deficiency, and being able to control the expression of the nucleic acid sequence affecting the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid.

Specific examples of a preferred combination of the nucleic acid sequence which is included in the fused gene of the present invention and affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid, and the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence which is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence and controls the expression of the nucleic acid include the following fused genes.

A fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT gene and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence

A fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT gene and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence

A fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a PDAT gene and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence

A fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a PDAT gene and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence

More specifically, examples of a combination of a DNA sequence derived from Arabidopsis thaliana and a phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence include a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT2 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT3 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT4 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a PDAT gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD2 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT2 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT3 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a DGAT4 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence; and a fused gene including a DNA sequence that encodes a PDAT gene of Arabidopsis thaliana and a sequence of a promoter of an MGD3 gene that is operably linked to the DNA sequence and controls the expression of the DNA sequence.

Among these, the sequences relating to the promoter sequences of MGD2 and MGD3 genes are preferable because these sequences are extremely strongly induced in a phosphorus-deficient state. Furthermore, these sequences are preferable because they are control sequences that respond at a timing delayed from the beginning of the phosphorus-deficient state, and thus the growth process of the host plant is not easily affected by the sequences.

In the present invention and the present specification, the “stringent conditions” can be created by, for example, the method described in Molecular Cloning—A LABORATORY MANUAL THIRD EDITION (Sambrook et al, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Examples thereof include conditions under which hybridization is performed by incubating for several hours or overnight at 55° C. to 70° C. in a hybridization buffer composed of 5×SSC (composition of 20×SSC: 3 M sodium chloride, 0.3 M citric acid solution, pH 7.0), 0.1% by weight N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% by weight SDS, and a 2% by weight blocking reagent for nucleic acid hybridization, and 50% formamide. A wash buffer used at the time of washing after incubation is preferably a 1×SSC solution containing 0.1% by weight SDS and more preferably a 0.1×SSC solution containing 0.1% by weight SDS.

The base sequence identity is calculated by, for example, a Lipman-Pearson method (Science, 227, 1435(1985)). Specifically, by using a homology analysis (Search Homology) program of genetic information processing software Genetyx-Win (Ver.5.1.1; Software Development), analysis is performed by setting Unit size to compare (ktup) to be 2, thereby calculating the base sequence identity. The amino acid sequence identity is calculated using, for example, a program of BLASTP provided from the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

<<Vector>>

The vector of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it contains the fused gene of the present invention. For example, the vector of the present invention may be prepared as an expression vector by using any expression vector which is generally used for constructing transgenic plant cells or transgenic plants, and incorporating relevant genes into the expression vector by a known gene recombination technique. Examples of the expression vector include binary vectors such as pBI121, pBI101, pCAMBIA, and GATEWAY.

The vector of the present invention may further have a sequence of any selection marker gene. The use of the selection marker gene makes it possible to easily select a plant in which the vector of the present invention is transformed and a plant in which it is not transformed. Examples of the selection marker gene include a hygromycin resistance gene, a kanamycin resistance gene, a bialaphos resistance gene, and the like.

According to the vector of the present invention, it is possible to provide a transgenic plant which can more efficiently manufacture vegetable fat or oil compared to a plant cultivated in a phosphorus-deficient state or a plant suffering from phosphorus deficiency known in the related art. Furthermore, the components of the manufactured vegetable fat or oil can be further improved compared to the original components thereof from the host.

<<Kit for Constructing Transgenic Plant>>

The kit for constructing a transgenic plant of the present invention includes the vector of the present invention. In addition to the vector of the present invention, the kit of the present invention may further include a solvent, a dispersion medium, a reagent, instructions for using these, and the like. Herein, to “include” a solvent and the like means a state in which the solvent and the like are contained in any of the containers (for example, a bottle, a plate, a tube, a dish, and the like) constituting the kit. The “instructions” may be written or printed on paper or other media. Alternatively, the instructions may be recorded in a magnetic tape, a computer-readable disk or tape, or an electronic media such as a CD-ROM. Furthermore, the kit of the present invention may include containers containing a diluent, a solvent, a cleaning liquid, and other reagents.

<<Transgenic Plant and Method for Constructing Transgenic Plant>>

The transgenic plant of the present invention contains the fused genes of the present invention.

For constructing the transgenic plant of the present invention, the fused gene may be prepared before the transgenic plant is constructed, and the prepared fused gene may be introduced into a host such that the host contains the fused gene. Furthermore, for constructing the transgenic plant of the present invention, for example, in the vicinity of the “phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence” in a genome of a host, only the “nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” may be introduced into the host such that the expression of the nucleic acid sequence is controlled, thereby preparing a fused gene. The fused gene of the present invention may be contained in the host in the aforementioned manner. Alternatively, for constructing the transgenic plant of the present invention, in the vicinity of the “nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” in a genome of a host, only the “phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence” may be introduced into the host such that the expression of the nucleic acid sequence is controlled, thereby preparing a fused gene. The fused gene of the present invention may be contained in the host in the aforementioned manner. Examples of the above sequence introduction techniques include gene targeting.

The fused gene of the present invention has the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence. Therefore, the transgenic plant of the present invention, in which the fused gene of the present invention is contained and thus the nucleic acid sequence affecting the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid is expressed due to the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence, can favorably grow. The following can be considered as one of the reasons. A plant immediately after germination can grow by using a small amount of phosphorus, and after it grows to some extent, the plant tends to easily suffer from phosphorus deficiency. Accordingly, the phosphorus deficiency responsiveness tends to be induced after the plant grows to some extent and the tissue thereof fully grows. As a result, the induction of expression of the protein which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid caused by the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence does not easily affect the growth process of the host plant, for example. If a plant can favorably grow, vegetable fat or oil can be more efficiently manufactured. This is because fat or oil starts to be manufactured after the plant tissue as a place manufacturing fat or oil is formed in a favorably organized manner. It is considered that accordingly the function of manufacturing fat or oil is satisfactorily performed.

According to the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence, it is possible to make a large amount of neutral lipid accumulate in tissue other than in seeds. In the related art, a method was tried in which a protein affecting the biosynthesis of neutral lipid having a special fatty acid composition is forcibly expressed in seeds so as to synthesize a large amount of neutral lipid having a special fatty acid composition in the seeds. However, in a case where the neutral lipid having a special fatty acid composition was excessively accumulated in seeds, fertility deteriorated in some cases depending on the type of the fatty acid, and this was not preferable for using the plant. In contrast, the method of manufacturing a large amount of neutral lipid in leaves by using the phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence does not easily affect the developmental process of a host plant in seeds and makes it possible to more efficiently manufacture vegetable fat or oil.

The transgenic plant of the present invention may be obtained by introducing the vector of the present invention into a host.

As long as the fused gene of the present invention is introduced into the host, “introducing the vector of the present invention into a host” may be the introduction of the entirety of the vector or the introduction of a partial nucleic acid sequence of the vector.

The type of the plant used in the present invention and the plant used as a host is not particularly limited as long as the plants are living organisms conducting photosynthesis. The same can be applied to various algae such as blue-green algae, red algae, diatoms, and green algae.

The plant used in the present invention and the plant used as a host are preferably terrestrial plants. From the viewpoint of growth speed, the obtained phytomass (biomass amount), and the like, it is preferable to use seed plants because they are advantageous to efficient production. Examples of the seed plants include angiosperms like a mono-cotyledonous plant such as Arecaceae or Gramineae and a dicotyledonous plant such as Leguminosae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Pedaliaceae, Oleaceae, Lythraceae, Lamiaceae, Apiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, or Malvaceae, gymnosperms like Pinaceae and Ginkgoaceae, and the like.

Examples of more specific plant species include coco palms (Cocos nucifera), palms (Elaeis guineensi and Elaeis oleifera), and the like belonging to Arecaceae, rice (Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima), corn (Zea mays), miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), and the like belonging to Gramineae, soybean (Glycine max) and the like belonging to Leguminosae, rape seeds (Brassica rapa and Brassica napus), Arabidopsis thaliana, Camelina sativa, Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. glabra), cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), Komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. peruviridis), Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. nipposinica), watercress (Nasturtium officinale), and the like belonging to Brassicaceae, sunflower (Helianthus annuus), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), and the like belonging to Asteraceae, castor seeds (Ricinus communis) and Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) belonging to Euphorbiaceae, sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum) and the like belonging to Pedaliaceae, olive (Olea europea) and the like belonging to Oleaceae, cuphea (Cuphea hyssopifolia) and the like belonging to Lythraceae, Aojiso (Perilla frutescens var. cripsa), Akajiso (Perilla frutescen var. crispa), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), and the like belonging to Lamiaceae, Mitsuba (Cryptotaenia japonica), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), parsley (Petroselium cripsum), and the like belonging to Apiaceae, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and the like belonging to Chenopodiaceae, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and the like belonging to Solanaceae. Among these, angiosperms are preferable, dicotyledonous plants are more preferable, and plants belonging to Brassicaceae are even more preferable. Among these, Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato, rape seeds, barnyard grass, or tobacco is more preferable, and Arabidopsis thaliana is even more preferable.

As the method for introducing the vector of the present invention or the sequence included in the fused gene of the present invention into a plant, it is possible to use a known agrobacterium method, a particle gun method, an electroporation method, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) method, and the like.

As the plant material to which the vector of the present invention or the sequence included in the fused gene of the present invention is introduced, plant organs or plant tissues such as stems, leaves, seeds, embryo, ovule, ovary, shoot apex, anther, and pollen may be used, or plant culture cells may be used. In a case where plant tissues and the like are used as transgenic materials, for example, a method can be adopted in which callus is formed by dedifferentiating the plant tissues in a known callus-forming medium and then transplanted into a medium for inducing redifferentiation so as to obtain an adventitious embryo or an adventitious bud, and a transgenic plant is obtained therefrom.

The transgenic plant of the present invention includes plant cells or plants, into which the vector of the present invention or the sequence of the fused gene of the present invention is expressibly introduced, offspring of plants that have the same properties as the plants, or tissues derived from these.

Whether or not the vector of the present invention or the sequence included in the fused gene of the present invention has been introduced into a plant may be checked by a PCR method, a southern hybridization method, a northern hybridization method, and the like. Alternatively, it may be checked using the aforementioned selection marker gene. In a case where a reporter gene is used as the selection marker gene, the expression of the reporter gene in the plant can be used as a parameter. Furthermore, in a case where a drug resistance gene is used as the selection marker gene, a transgenic plant can be selected using the resistance to the drug as a parameter.

The transgenic plant of the present invention may be a plant in which at least one function selected from the group consisting of carbohydrate metabolism, starch biosynthesis, and membrane lipid metabolism is depressed or inhibited.

The host described above may be a plant in which at least one function selected from the group consisting of carbohydrate metabolism, starch biosynthesis, and membrane lipid metabolism is depressed or inhibited.

Examples of the plant in which the function of starch biosynthesis is depressed or inhibited include a plant in which the biosynthesis of starch is inhibited and the accumulation of starch in, for example, leaves is further depressed than in the original plant (wild type). Examples thereof include a plant in which the accumulation amount of starch in leaves is preferably decreased and becomes about 0% to 50% and more preferably becomes about 0% to 20% of the accumulation amount of starch in the wild type.

Examples of the method for obtaining the plant in which the biosynthesis of starch is inhibited include the inactivation of the function by causing a deletion or insertion mutation in structural genes of an enzyme which is involved in key steps of the biosynthesis of starch, that is, the generation of glucose-1-phosphate from glucose-6-phosphate, the generation of ADP glucose from glucose-1-phosphate, and the generation of starch from ADP glucose. The examples also include the inhibition (inactivation or the like) of gene expression by causing a deletion or insertion mutation in a domain involved in the expression of the genes.

Examples of the enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of starch include phosphoglucomutase (PGM) involved in the generation of glucose-1-phosphate from glucose-6-phosphate, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) involved in the generation of ADP glucose from glucose-1-phosphate, and starch synthase (SS) synthesizing starch from ADP glucose. Examples of the structural genes thereof include a PGM gene, an APL gene, an ADG gene, and a soluble glycogen synthase-related gene (see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2012-153833). Specific examples of the plant include an adg1-1 mutant and an aps1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana in which the functions of the ADG gene are inactivated and inhibited respectively.

The plant in which the “function of membrane lipid metabolism” is depressed or inhibited refers to a plant in which the function involved in the reduction of the amount of a precursor substance for the biosynthesis of neutral lipid in the membrane lipid metabolism is depressed or inhibited.

In a plant suffering from phosphorus deficiency, by using phospholipid-derived phosphorus in the plant, the metabolic pathway runs such that glycolipid is synthesized as an alternative to phospholipid, and as a result, phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a precursor substance of TAG is converted into diacylglycerol (DAG) and then into glycolipid (digalactosyldiacylglycerol, DGDG). Therefore, examples of the method for obtaining the plant in which the function of the membrane lipid metabolism is depressed or inhibited include the inactivation of the function by causing a deletion or insertion mutation in the structural genes of an enzyme such as PLD, which is an enzyme involved in the conversion of PC into DAG and then DGDG, and the inhibition (inactivation or the like) of the gene expression by causing a deletion or insertion mutation in a domain involved in the expression of the genes.

Examples of the method for causing a deletion mutation in the genes and in the base sequence of the domain of the expression control sequence thereof and the like include a method of using a mutation-inducing agent such as ethyl methanesulfonate or nitrosoguanidine and a method of performing irradiation of γ rays and the like. From a group of random mutants generated by these deletion methods, mutants in which the intended function is depressed or inhibited should be selected.

Examples of the method of causing an insertion mutation in the genes and in the base sequence of the domain of the expression control sequence thereof and the like include the insertion of a T-DNA domain on a Ti plasmid by an agrobacterium transformation method, a method of using a transposon, and the like. From a group of random mutants generated by these insertion methods, mutants in which the intended function is depressed or inhibited should be selected.

The transgenic plant of the present invention may be a plant obtained by the hybridization between a transgenic plant containing the fused gene of the present invention or a transgenic plant that becomes a host into which the vector of the present invention is introduced and a plant in which at least one function selected from the group consisting of carbohydrate metabolism, starch biosynthesis, and membrane lipid metabolism is depressed or inhibited.

For example, a transgenic plant may be obtained by introducing the vector of the present invention into a wild-type plant used as a host and then hybridized with any plant in which at least one function selected from the group of carbohydrate metabolism, starch biosynthesis, and membrane lipid metabolism is depressed or inhibited, thereby obtaining a transgenic plant which has the vector of the present invention and in which the aforementioned function is depressed or inhibited.

As described above, by depressing or inhibiting at least one function selected from the group consisting of carbohydrate metabolism, starch biosynthesis, and membrane lipid metabolism in the transgenic plant of the present invention, the amount of fat or oil accumulated in the plant can be markedly increased, and vegetable fat or oil can be efficiently manufactured.

<<Method for Manufacturing Vegetable Fat or Oil>>

The method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil of the present invention includes a cultivation step of cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention.

At the time of recovering fat or oil manufactured by the method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil of the present invention, it is preferable to recover the fat or oil from the transgenic plant of the present invention including fully grown tissue.

The “transgenic plant including fully grown tissue” means a plant in which the plant tissue of root, stems, leaves, and the like have been fully grown under normal conditions. That is, in a case where the plant is germinated from a seed, the transgenic plant including fully grown tissue means a plant which has grown to such a degree that rooting or two or more foliage leaves are observed. Preferred examples of the transgenic plant including fully grown tissue include a plant which is cultivated in a medium containing an appropriate amount of phosphorus, and includes grown plant tissue of root, stems, leaves, and the like, and has a sufficient phytomass (biomass amount), that is, a plant which has been so grown that the weight thereof becomes 10 times or more of the weight of the seed.

At the time of recovering fat or oil manufactured by the method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil of the present invention, it is preferable to recover neutral lipid accumulated in tissue other than seeds because the biomass amount of the tissue is great. The tissue other than seeds is more preferably leaves because the producible biomass amount thereof is extremely great.

The method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil of the present invention preferably further includes a step of cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention in a phosphorus-deficient state.

Examples of the step of “cultivating in a phosphorus-deficient state” include 1) a step of cultivating a plant including fully grown tissue by transplanting it into a phosphorus-deficient medium, 2) a step of cultivating the plant by replacing the medium thereof with a phosphorus-deficient medium, 3) a step of cultivating the plant while maintaining a phosphorus-deficient state that can be created in the medium in the process of cultivation, and the like.

The medium used for cultivation is not limited in any of the growth stages of the plant and the accumulation stage of fat or oil, and it is possible to use soil, a water culture medium (culture solution), a solid medium, and the like. Furthermore, any of outdoor sunlight, artificial indoor lighting, and the like can be used, and the amount of light or the irradiation time is not particularly limited. However, it is desirable to use optimal conditions unique to the plant.

The “phosphorus-deficient state” means a state where the medium does not contain phosphorus or contains phosphorus at an extremely low concentration. Specifically, from the viewpoint of promoting the accumulation of neutral lipid, it is desirable that the phosphorus concentration in the medium be close to zero. In a case where the phosphorus concentration is not zero, it is preferably less than 1/30, more preferably equal to or less than 1/100, even more preferably equal to or less than 1/300, and particularly preferably equal to or less than 1/1,000 of the concentration of phosphorus used in general cultivation.

For example, in a case where the plant is hydroponically cultivated using the medium shown in Table 1 or cultivated using an agar medium, the phosphorus concentration of the medium containing phosphorus at an extremely low concentration is preferably less than 33 μM, more preferably equal to or less than 10 μM, even more preferably equal to or less than 3.3 μM, particularly preferably equal to or less than 1 μM, and most preferably equal to or less than 0.33 μM.

The method for manufacturing vegetable fat or oil of the present invention preferably further includes a step of cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention as a plant suffering from phosphorus deficiency.

The “mutant plant suffering from phosphorus deficiency” means, for example, a mutant plant in which the phosphorus concentration is reduced because the transport of phosphorus or the like is hindered. The state where the transport of phosphorus is hindered means, for example, a state in which genes involved in phosphorus transport have a problem, and examples of the mutant include phol and pho2 of Arabidopsis thaliana (reference: Journal of Plant Physiology (1991) Vol. 97, p. 1087). Even if such a mutant plant is not cultivated in a phosphorus-deficient state, that is, even if such a mutant plant is in a medium containing phosphorus, the accumulation of neutral lipid is promoted in the plant.

The cultivation in the phosphorus-deficient state should be performed at a normal temperature, humidity, and pH and under normal light irradiation conditions. The duration of the cultivation in the phosphorus-deficient state is not particularly limited. However, in view of the accumulation of neutral lipid, the plant is cultivated preferably for several days to several weeks, particularly preferably for 3 days to 3 weeks, and most preferably for 1 to 2 weeks.

For example, in a case where Arabidopsis thaliana is used as the plant, it should be cultivated under the conditions of 18° C. to 25° C., light intensity of 30 μE/cm2 to 70 μE/cm2, and irradiation time of 6 hrs/day to 24 hrs/day.

The method for preparing the medium used for the cultivation in the phosphorus-deficient state is not particularly limited. As the medium, soil which is generally called phosphorus-deficient soil, for example, soil which contains soluble phosphoric acid in an amount of equal to or less than 100 mg/100 g and preferably in an amount of equal to or less than 50 mg/100 g can be used. Furthermore, the medium can be prepared by applying a phosphorus-free fertilizer such as an NK chemical fertilizer to the aforementioned soil or by applying a fertilizer which is obtained by adding a phosphorus fertilizer such as a small amount of phosphoric acid to a phosphorus-free fertilizer such as an NK chemical fertilizer to the aforementioned soil. In a case where a water culture medium or a solid medium is used, it is possible to use a culture solution or a medium obtained by appropriately formulating necessary nutrients other than phosphorus. The necessary nutrients other than phosphorus are not particularly limited and can include potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, calcium nitrate, sodium nitrate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, iron (III) sulfate, iron (III) chloride, iron (III) sulfate, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate, manganese sulfate, zinc sulfate, boric acid, copper sulfate, sodium molybdate, molybdenum trioxide, potassium iodide, cobalt chloride, aluminum chloride, nickel chloride, myo-inositol, thiamine hydrochloride, pyridoxine hydrochloride, nicotinic acid, folic acid, biotin, glycine, and the like. A gelling agent of the solid medium is not particularly limited, and agar, gelatin, Gelrite (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and the like can be used.

As an embodiment of the cultivation in the “phosphorus-deficient state”, for example, a plant including fully grown tissue grown in an MS medium (Physiologia Plantarum (1962) Vol. 15, p. 473) is cultivated by being transplanted into a medium having the composition shown in Table 1 or by replacing the MS medium with a phosphorus-free medium shown in Table 1. Alternatively, for example, a plant is further cultivated for several days to several weeks in a phosphorus-free state or in a state where the phosphorus concentration is extremely low, for instance, in a state where the phosphorus concentration is preferably less than 33 μM, more preferably equal to or less than 10 μM, even more preferably equal to or less than 3.3 μM, particularly preferably equal to or less than 1 μM, and most preferably equal to or less than 0.33 μM.

As another embodiment, for example, a plant is cultivated in a state where the phosphorus-deficient state created in the process of cultivation is maintained. In this case, after the plant is cultivated for an appropriate period of time, and thus the phosphorus concentration becomes extremely low, the cultivation should be further continued for several days to several weeks. The initial phosphorus concentration in the medium used in this case should be adjusted such that the phosphorus concentration in the medium becomes extremely low as described above or becomes zero after the plant is fully grown.

The method for recovering neutral lipid accumulated in the root, leaves, stems, or the like of the plant is not particularly limited. For example, vegetable fat or oil can be obtained by a method of pulverizing or squeezing the root, leaves, stems, and the like of the plant or by a method of extracting the vegetable fat or oil by using an appropriate solvent. More specifically, for example, by using a method of pulverizing the root, leaves, stems, or the like of the plant and then extracting vegetable fat or oil by normal hexane, a method such as a Bligh and Dyer method (Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. (1959) Vol. 37, p. 911), or the like, vegetable fat or oil can be efficiently extracted, and neutral lipid can be recovered in the form of being contained in the vegetable fat or oil. The vegetable fat or oil can be directly used as neutral lipid or can be used after a purification treatment such as degumming, deoxidizing, bleaching, and deodorizing, and the treatment method is not particularly limited. Furthermore, neutral lipid can be separated-recovered from the vegetable fat or oil, and the method thereof is not particularly limited. More specifically, examples thereof include separation by thin-layer chromatography, recovery from a silica gel plate, separation-collection using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the like.

By cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention in a phosphorus-deficient state or by cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention as a plant suffering from phosphorus deficiency, the amount of fat or oil accumulated in the plant can be further increased. Into the transgenic plant of the present invention, the vector “containing a nucleic acid sequence which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid and a phosphorus deficiency-responsive expression control sequence which is operably linked to the aforementioned nucleic acid sequence and controls the expression of the nucleic acid sequence” is introduced. Therefore, by cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention in the aforementioned state or cultivating the transgenic plant of the present invention as the aforementioned plant, fat or oil can be extremely efficiently manufactured by using the phosphorus-deficient conditions.

### EXAMPLES

Next, the present invention will be more specifically explained by describing examples, but the present invention is not limited to the following examples.

<Selecting Protein Affecting Biosynthesis of Nutral Lipid>

In a case where the “nucleic acid sequence which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid” included in the fused gene of the present invention encodes a protein which affects the biosynthesis or accumulation of neutral lipid, as the protein, various proteins can be selected. However, it is considered that among the proteins affecting the biosynthesis of neutral lipid, DGAT or PDAT1 exerts a great influence because these proteins are involved in the final stage of the TAG synthesis. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of further increasing the amount of the manufactured fat or oil, the conditions under which the DGAT or PDAT1 may affect the amount of the synthesized TAG were investigated.

As a plant known to particularly increase the accumulation amount of TAG in a phosphorus-deficient state, there is a pgm-1 mutant strain of Arabidopsis thaliana. The pgm-1 mutant strain is a mutant strain in which the function of a gene having an AGI code of At5g51820 is impaired due to mutation, and thus the carbohydrate metabolism and starch biosynthesis are hindered. The expression amount of mRNA of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene in the pgm-1 mutant strain and a wild strain was measured as below.

(Expression Analysis)

Forty seeds of each of the Col-0 strain (wild strain) and the pgm-1 mutant strain of Arabidopsis thaliana were seeded into an MS agar medium (Physiologia Plantarum (1962) Vol. 15, p. 473) and cultivated for 10 days under conditions of 22° C., light intensity of 40 μE/cm2 to 70 μE/cm2, and irradiation time of 24 hrs/day. The grown plants were removed with great care from the MS agar medium, and 20 individual plants of each strain were transplanted into the medium shown in Table 1 in which the concentration of soluble phosphoric acid (KH2PO4) was 0 mM. Furthermore, as a control group, 20 individual plants were transplanted into the medium shown in Table 1 containing 1 mM soluble phosphoric acid and cultivated for 10 days under the same conditions as described above. The cultivated plants were removed from the agar medium, and the above-ground part thereof was cut off. After the weight of the above-ground part was measured, the above-ground part was pulverized using a mortar in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using an SV Total RNA Isolation System (manufactured by Promega Corporation). Then, by using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (manufactured by TAKARA BIO INC.), a reverse transcription reaction was performed, thereby obtaining cDNA of total mRNA. By using the obtained cDNA and a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TP800, manufactured by TAKARA BIO INC.), real-time PCR was performed. At this time, SYBR PreMix Ex Taq (manufactured by TAKARA BIO INC.) was used as a reagent. The amount of a transcription product of interest was corrected based on the expression amount of mRNA of the ubiquitin-10 gene, thereby relativizing the expression amount of mRNA of each of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene. FIGS. 1A to 1C show the relative values of the expression amount of mRNA of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene in the wild strain and the pgm-1 mutant strain cultured under the conditions of normal phosphorus concentration (1 mM, indicated by +P) or under the phosphorus-deficient conditions (0 Mm, indicated by −P). FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C show the measured results of the expression amount of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene respectively. From the results shown in FIGS. 1A to 1C, it is understood that in the pgm-1 mutant strain known to particularly increase the accumulation amount of TAG in phosphorus-deficient conditions, under any of the conditions of normal phosphorus concentration and the phosphorus-deficient conditions, the expression amount of each of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene is the same as that of the wild strain.

<Preparation of Vector>

As described above, the inventors of the present invention obtained knowledge that in the plant cultivated in a phosphorus-deficient state, even if the amount of triacylglycerol (TAG) per plant is increased, the expression amount of the gene which encodes acyltransferase causing a reaction of converting an acyl group into a diacylglycerol (DAG) skeleton as a final stage of TAG biosynthesis is the same as the expression amount thereof in the wild-type plant. Based on the knowledge, the inventors assumed that by controlling the expression of the gene involved in the TAG synthesis pathway in the plant cultivated in the phosphorus-deficient state or in the plant suffering from phosphorus deficiency, more TAG may be able to be accumulated in the plant tissue. Based on the assumption, the inventors prepared the following vectors.

**Example 1-1**

First, from total RNA extracted from leaves of the wild strain of Arabidopsis thaliana, cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR. Thereafter, by using a primer 1-1F: 5′-CGCCCGGGTATGGCGATTTTGGATTCTGCTGGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 19) and a primer 2-1: 5′-GCGAGCTCTCATGACATCGATCCTTTTCGGTTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 20), the sequence was amplified, thereby obtaining a base sequence encoding the DGAT1 gene. Then, the base sequence was cloned into a pMD20 cloning vector (TAKARA BIO INC.), and by using Quikchange lightning reaction (QIAGEN), a SacI cleavage site in the sequence was modified. As a result, a modified sequence including a base sequence encoding the DGAT1 gene was obtained.

An atMGD3::GUS/pBI101 vector including a base sequence of a promoter of the MGD3 gene represented by SEQ ID NO: 12 was obtained by the method described in Kobayashi et al. 2004 Plant Phys. By using a DNA Ligation Kit (Mighty Mix) (manufactured by TAKARA BIO INC.), the modified sequence including the base sequence encoding the DGAT1 gene was linked to the site of SmaI/SacI on the binary vector atMGD3::GUS/pBI101 through a ligation reaction. As a result, a vector of Example 1-1 having the base sequence of the promoter of the MGD3 gene and the base sequence encoding the DGAT1 gene was obtained.

The vector of Example 1-1 was introduced into an agrobacterium GV3101 strain.

**Example 1-2**

From total RNA extracted from leaves of the wild strain of Arabidopsis thaliana, cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR.

Then, in the same manner as in Example 1-1, a vector of Example 1-2 having the base sequence of the promoter of the MGD3 gene and the base sequence encoding the DGAT2 gene was obtained.

The vector of Example 1-2 was introduced into the agrobacterium GV3101 strain.

**Example 1-3**

From total RNA extracted from leaves of the wild strain of Arabidopsis thaliana, cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR. Thereafter, by using a primer 1-3: 5′-CGCCCGGGTATGCCCCTTATCATCGGAAAAAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 29) and a primer 2-3: 5′-GCGAGCTCTCACAGCTTCAGGTCAATACGCTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 30), the sequence was amplified, thereby obtaining a base sequence encoding the PDAT1 gene. Then, in the same manner as in Example 1-1, a vector of Example 1-3 having the base sequence of the promoter of the MGD3 gene and the base sequence encoding the PDAT 1 gene was obtained.

The vector of Example 1-3 was introduced into the Agrobacterium GV3101 strain.

**Example 3-1**

The pgm-1 mutant strain was cultivated, and the vector of Example 1-1 was introduced into the plant in the same manner as in Example 2-1.

**Example 3-2**

The pgm-1 mutant strain was cultivated, and the vector of Example 1-2 was introduced into the plant in the same manner as in Example 2-1.

(Confirmation of Expression of DGAT1 Gene in Transgenic Plant)

In the same manner as used in the expression analysis of the DGAT1 gene, the expression amount of the DGAT1 gene in the transgenic plants of Examples 2-1 and 3-1 was determined; the expression amount of the DGAT2 gene in the transgenic plants of Examples 2-2 and 3-2 was determined; and the expression amount of the PDAT1 gene in the transgenic plants in Examples 2-3 and 3-3 was determined. The results are shown in FIGS. 2A to 20C. From the results, it could be confirmed that in the transgenic plants of Examples 2-1 to 2-3 and Examples 3-1 to 3-3, the expression of each of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the DAT1 gene was controlled and increased in response to phosphorus deficiency.

Table 3 shows the plant of each example used for manufacturing fat or oil.

(Measurement of Fresh Weight of Plant)

Each of the plants cultivated for manufacturing fat or oil in Comparative examples 1 to 6 and each of the transgenic plants cultivated for manufacturing fat or oil in Examples 4 to 15 were removed from the agar medium after cultivation and cut into above-ground parts (leaves and stems) and roots. Thereafter, the weight of the above-ground parts was measured (for 20 individuals). The results are shown in FIG. 3.

Through the comparison between Comparative examples 1 and 2 and Comparative examples 3 and 4, it was understood that the plants grow better when cultivated under the phosphorus-deficient conditions than under the nitrogen-deficient conditions. Furthermore, from the comparison between Examples 4 to 15 and Comparative examples 3 to 6, it was confirmed that the growth of the transgenic plants of Examples 4 to 15 into which any of the vectors of Examples 1-1 to 1-3 was introduced is as excellent as the growth of the wild strain and the pgm-1 mutant strain into which none of the vectors of Examples 1-1 to 1-3 were introduced.

(Measurement of Accumulation Amount of Fat or Oil in Plant)

The components of fat or oil in the plant tissue were analyzed by the following method.

(1) Extraction and Pretreatment

The total lipid was extracted based on a Bligh and Dyer method (Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. (1959) Vol. 37, p. 911). From the total lipid, TAG was separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC Silica gel 60, 20×20 cm, Merck & Co., Inc., product code 1.05721.0009, composition of developing solvent: hexane:diethylether:acetic acid=160:40:4 (vol/vol)). By collecting the segregated spots of TAG from the plate, the content was measured.

(2) Measurement of Amount of Neutral Lipid

TAG was subjected to a methanolysis treatment with using a 15:0 fatty acid as an internal standard sample. Specifically, in a screw-capped glass test tube, 100 μl of 1 mM 15:0 hexane solution (pentadecanoic acid, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., P-6125) and 350 μl of a 5% hydrogen chloride-methanol solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., 089-03971) were added to silica gel powder containing TAG, and the resultant was treated for 1 hour at 85° C. After the methanolysis treatment, fatty acid methyl ester was recovered using hexane and dried and solidified in nitrogen gas. Then, the resultant was recovered using 60 μl of hexane, and 3 μl of the resultant was analyzed by gas chromatography. By gas chromatography (Shimadzu Corporation, GC-2014, column: ULBON HR-SS-10 (25 m, 0.25 mm ID) from Shinwa Chemical Industries Ltd., column temperature: 180° C., temperature of gasification chamber and detector: 250° C., inlet pressure (kPa): 68.2, flow rate of column (ml/min): 0.53, split ratio: 68.8, measurement time: 15 min), separation-quantification were performed.

(3) Measurement of Dry Weight of Plant Tissue

After the plants were subjected to a freeze-drying treatment for 20 hours, the weight thereof was measured, thereby obtaining a dry weight.

Each of the plants cultivated for manufacturing fat or oil in Comparative examples 1 to 6 and each of the transgenic plants cultivated for manufacturing fat or oil in Examples 4 to 15 were removed from the agar medium after cultivation and cut into above-ground parts (leaves and stems) and root. The above-ground parts were pulverized using a mortar in liquid nitrogen, and fat was extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method described above (20 individuals for each plant). Thereafter, TAG was separated-purified by thin-layer chromatography. Then, TAG was subjected to a methanolysis treatment by using methanol and hydrochloride, and lipid analysis was performed using gas chromatography. FIG. 4 shows a ratio (% by weight) of TAG amount per individual plant (dry weight). FIG. 5 shows the TAG amount per individual plant (fresh weight).

As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, it is understood that in a case where the plant is cultivated under the phosphorus-deficient conditions, the accumulation of fat or oil can be further improved while the growth of the plant is being favorably maintained, than in a case where the plant is cultivated under the nitrogen-deficient conditions.

As shown in FIG. 4, in the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 4, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 4 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 8, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 2 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 12, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 2 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 5, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 2.5 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 4 and about 20 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 9, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 1.3 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 4 and about 7 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 13, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 2 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 4 and about 10 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3.

The above results clearly show that in the transgenic plants in which each of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene is expressed by the phosphorus deficiency-responsive promoter sequence, the TAG accumulation in the plant can be improved, and the TAG accumulation can be greatly improved by cultivating the transgenic plants in a phosphorus-deficient state.

As shown in FIG. 4, in the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 6, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 10 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3 and about 7 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 5.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 10, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 6.5 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3 and about 3.5 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain of Comparative example 5.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 14, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 8 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3 and about 4.5 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain of Comparative example 5.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 7, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 4 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 4 and about 2.5 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 6.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 11, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 2 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 4 and about 1.1 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 6.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 15, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 3.5 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 4 and about 2 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 6.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 7, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 30 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3 and about 17 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 5.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 11, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 12 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3 and about 7 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 5.

In the leaves and stems of the transgenic plant in Example 15, the effect of improving TAG accumulation was about 19 times stronger than in the wild strain in Comparative example 3 and about 11 times stronger than in the pgm-1 mutant strain in Comparative example 5.

From the above results, it was confirmed that in the transgenic plants in which any of the DGAT1 gene, the DGAT2 gene, and the PDAT1 gene is expressed by the phosphorus deficiency-responsive promoter sequence, by depressing the functions of carbohydrate metabolism and starch biosynthesis, the TAG accumulation in the plants can also be further improved, and the TAG accumulation can be markedly improved by cultivating the transgenic plants in a phosphorus-deficient state.

Each of the constituents, combinations thereof, and the like in each of the aforementioned embodiments is merely an example. Within a scope that does not depart from the gist of the present invention, the constituents can be added, omitted, or substituted and may be modified in other ways. Furthermore, the present invention is not limited to each of the embodiments but limited by only the scope of claims.

## INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY

According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a transgenic plant which makes it possible to efficiently manufacture vegetable fat or oil while continuing photosynthesis of the plant. The transgenic plant of the present invention is useful because the plant makes it possible to particularly efficiently manufacture vegetable fat or oil especially when the plant is cultivated under phosphorus-deficient conditions such as the cultivation in phosphoric acid-deficient soil. Therefore, the transgenic plant makes a contribution to the utilization of phosphorus-deficient soil which is increasing all over the world, including Asia, is unsuitable for the growth of crops and the like, and thus becomes problematic in terms of agricultural utilization. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a new method which can manufacture a large amount of fat or oil by using leaves of plants that have not been generally used for producing fat or oil.

In addition, the properties of the generated fat or oil can be freely modified, and by manufacturing fat or oil composed of fatty acids used for fuel having high market prices, the industrial applicability thereof can be further widened.
