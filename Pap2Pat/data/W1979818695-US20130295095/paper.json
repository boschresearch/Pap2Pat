    "title": "Identification of Low Molecular Weight Pyroglutamate A\u03b2 Oligomers in Alzheimer Disease",
    "date": "2010-12-01",
    "abstract": "N-terminally truncated A\u03b2 peptides starting with pyroglutamate (A\u03b2pE3) represent a major fraction of all A\u03b2 peptides in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. A\u03b2pE3 has a higher aggregation propensity and stability and shows increased toxicity compared with full-length A\u03b2. In the present work, we generated a novel monoclonal antibody (9D5) that selectively recognizes oligomeric assemblies of A\u03b2pE3 and studied the potential involvement of oligomeric A\u03b2pE3 in vivo using transgenic mouse models as well as human brains from sporadic and familial AD cases. 9D5 showed an unusual staining pattern with almost nondetectable plaques in sporadic AD patients and non-demented controls. Interestingly, in sporadic and familial AD cases prominent intraneuronal and blood vessel staining was observed. Using a novel sandwich ELISA significantly decreased levels of oligomers in plasma samples from patients with AD compared with healthy controls were identified. Moreover, passive immunization of 5XFAD mice with 9D5 significantly reduced overall A\u03b2 plaque load and A\u03b2pE3 levels, and normalized behavioral deficits. These data indicate that 9D5 is a therapeutically and diagnostically effective monoclonal antibody targeting low molecular weight A\u03b2pE3 oligomers.",

                "Antibodies-The A\u2424pE3 oligomer specific antibodies 9D5 (IgG2b; official name of cell line PG3-38 9D5H6) and 8C4 (IgG1; official name of cell line PG3-38 8C4D2) were generated by the University Medicine Goettingen and Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany) by immunizing three Balb/c mice with A\u2424pE3-38 (supplemental Fig. S1). After preparation of the lymph nodes cells were fused with the myeloma cell line P3-X63-Ag8. The hybridoma supernatants of mixed clones were screened by ELISA and subcloned. The monoclonal antibodies 9D5 and 8C4 were selected by ELISA against different N-terminal A\u2424 epitopes. Clones producing signals with A\u2424pE3-38 and A\u2424pE3-42, but no signal with A\u2424pE1-42 were isolated and further characterized. For comparison, A\u2424 antibodies 4G8 (A\u2424 epitope 17-24; Covance), W0 -2 (A\u2424 epitope 5-8; The Genetics Company), G2-10 (A\u2424 epitope x-40; The Genetics Company), G2-11 (A\u2424 epitope x-42), NT78 (against generic A\u24241-16, Synaptic Systems), and 2-48 (against N-terminal A\u2424pE3, Synaptic Systems ( 19)) were used. The specific binding to A\u2424pE3-42 and not to A\u2424pE3-7has been demonstrated in an ELISA assay (supplemental Fig. S2). GFAP (rabbit) and IBA1 (rabbit) antisera were from Synaptic Systems and Wako Pure Chemicals, respectively.",
                "Size-exclusion Chromatography (SEC) followed by Dot Blot-Prior to experiments, synthetic A\u2424 peptides (Peptide Speciality Laboratory) were monomerized in 98% formic acid (20). After immediate evaporation of the solvent, peptides were dissolved to 1 mg/ml in 0.1% ammonia following ultrasonic treatment. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 75 (10/30HR) column (Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots of freshly dissolved 0.2 mg of synthetic peptide were loaded, and 0.5-ml fractions were eluted with 1\u03eb PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For detection of A\u2424 peptides by dot blot, fractions were spotted on 0.2-m nitrocellulose and either detected by monoclonal W0 -2 or 9D5 antibody. Different batches of A\u2424 peptides were used to exclude individual differences, which were not observed throughout all studies. The SEC peaks were calibrated using the following molecular weight standards of the column: blue dextran (\u03fe200 kDa); bovine serum albumin (67 kDa); ovalbumin; (43 kDa); chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa); RNaseA (13.7 kDa); aprotinin (6.5 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). The corresponding stoichiometries were calculated and expressed as previously published (6,(21)(22).",

Aggregation of A\u2424 peptides was investigated online using ThT aggregation assay (Varian fluorescence spectrophotometer) using an excitation wavelength of 446 nm and emission wavelength of 482 nm. Samples contained 55 M A\u2424, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 20 M ThT, and 0.01% sodium azide. The samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a peltier adapter with stirring. Data points were recorded every 10 min during the assay.",
                "Toxicity of Peptides on Neuroblastoma Cells-Toxicity was verified as previously published (6). Briefly, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were routinely cultured. After 48 h, medium was replaced by medium containing freshly dissolved peptides, each at 2 M concentration in the presence or absence of 1 ng/l 9D5 antibody and incubated for 12 h. Cell viability was determined using MTS assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions compared with vehicle-treated control cells.",

The patients were recruited at the Memory Clinic at the Department of Geriatrics, Uppsala University Hospital. All AD patients were diagnosed according to DSM IV and NINCDS-ADRDA. A\u2424pE oligomer levels in human plasma samples were measured by ELISA according to standard methods. Briefly 9D5 antibody was coated as capture antibody and blocked with 5% skimmed milk, 0.05% Tween in PBS.

                "Transgenic Mice-APP/PS1KI (23) and 5XFAD (24) female bigenic mice have been described previously. All mice were backcrossed for more than 10 generations on a C57BL/6J genetic background and housed at a 12-h day/12-h night cycle with free access to food and water. For passive immunization 4.5-month-old 5XFAD mice were weekly injected with 250 g of 9D5 or PBS intraperitoneally for 6 weeks. 9D5 antibody was purified by protein G-agarose. 250-ml culture supernatant was applied to the column and allowed to drain through. The column was washed with 200 ml of PBS, and the antibodies were eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.5), neutralized with 100 l of 1.5 M Tris/HCL buffer (pH 8.8). Samples were measured at 280 nm. Eluted IgG fractions containing the highest absorptions were pooled and dialyzed with PBS. PBS injection has been used previously as a control for treatment effects of passive immunization of different AD mouse models with a variety of A\u2424 antibodies (25)(26)(27)(28)(29). All animals were handled according to German guidelines for animal care and studies were approved by the local legal authorities (LAVES).",

In brief, 4-m paraffin sections were pretreated with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in PBS to block endogenous peroxidases, and antigen retrieval was achieved by boiling sections in 0.01 M citrate buffer pH 6.0, followed by 3-min incubation in 88% formic acid. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight, followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (DAKO) before staining was visualized using the ABC method with the Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen. Alternatively, fluorochromated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse AlexaFluor594 and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488, Invitrogen) were used for immunofluorescence detection.",

Serial images of 40\u03eb magnification (hippocampus) and 100\u03eb (cortex) were captured on six sections per animal, which were 30 m afar from each other. Using ImageJ the pictures were binarized to 16-bit black and white images and a fixed intensity threshold was applied defining the DAB staining.",

                        "Detecting A\u2424pE3 Oligomers-Two mouse monoclonal antibodies (9D5 and 8C4) were identified with similar binding characteristics. Because 9D5 and 8C4 were competing for the same epitope in dot blot analysis and showing an indistinguishable staining pattern using immunohistochemistry (supplemental Fig. S1), only 9D5 was studied in greater detail. To analyze the binding properties of the oligomeric A\u2424pE3 anti-body (9D5), we performed SEC under native conditions with N-terminally truncated and modified A\u2424pE3-42 and wildtype A\u24241-42 peptides followed by dot blot analysis. SEC of A\u24241-42 showed dominant peaks of low-n oligomers (4 -6\u03eb) with some higher (16 -20\u03eb) and few smaller (1-2\u03eb) aggregates (6,21,(31)(32)(33)(34)(35). In contrast, SEC of A\u2424pE3-42 yielded high levels of smaller forms (1-2\u03eb), low-n oligomers (4 -6\u03eb) and lower levels of higher oligomeric aggregates (10 -20\u03eb), indicating differential aggregation characteristics of A\u24241-42 and A\u2424pE3-42. All A\u24241-42 and A\u2424pE3-42 SEC fractions were recognized by the generic A\u2424 antibody W0 -2 in a dot blot analysis, however, the 9D5 antibody detected only low-n oligomeric fractions (4 -10\u03eb) of A\u2424pE3-42, whereas no signal was obtained using the A\u24241-42 fractions (Fig. 1, A andB). Under denaturing conditions 9D5 detected one single band of low molecular weight (LMW) A\u2424pE3-42 without any cross reactivity for A\u24241-42. As expected, W0 -2 detected a range of aggregation states of \u2329\u24241-42 peptides as well as monomeric A\u24241-42 (Fig. 1C). Together, these data demonstrate that 9D5 is highly selective for lower oligomeric variants of A\u2424pE3-42.",
                        "Antibody 9D5 Inhibited Aggregation and Toxicity in Vitro-The aggregation of monomeric A\u24241-42 and A\u2424pE3-42 peptides (55 M) was investigated using a ThT fluorescence assay. While A\u24241-42 showed the expected aggregation profile with a pronounced lag phase before fibril growth, A\u2424pE3-42 showed very rapid formation of intermediate oligomeric assemblies. Interestingly, elongation rates of A\u2424pE3-42 were much slower as that of A\u24241-42 (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that A\u2424pE3-42 rapidly formed intermediate oligomeric assemblies, but has decreased propensity to form larger fibrils, a behavior that clearly differs from that of that of A\u24241-42. Notably, the presence of antibody 9D5 efficiently decreased the formation of higher aggregates of the A\u2424pE3-42 peptide at a 1:76 (9D5:A\u2424) ratio, but not the rapid formation of lower oligomers, further demonstrating the specificity of this antibody for lower oligomeric species of A\u2424pE3 and its efficiency in the inhibition of further peptide aggregation (Fig. 1E). This observation suggests that 9D5 inhibits the formation of higher A\u2424 aggregates by binding to LMW oligomers as indicated in SEC and Western blot experiments. We next studied the toxicity of A\u24241-42 and A\u2424pE3-42 peptides in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. To determine whether the toxic effect of A\u2424pE3-42 can be influenced by 9D5 antibody, we incubated neuroblastoma cells either with A\u24241-42, A\u2424pE3-42 or with peptides and 9D5. Application of both, A\u2424pE3-42 and 9D5 completely abolished the toxic effect of A\u2424pE3-42. This effect is highly specific, as application of A\u24241-42 together with 9D5 caused the same effect on cell viability as A\u24241-42 incubation alone (Fig. 1F).",
                        "Antibody 9D5 Shows a Specific Staining Profile in Alzheimer Brain-9D5 was used to characterize the distribution of oligomeric A\u2424pE in human post-mortem brain tissue (frontal cortex and hippocampus from sporadic AD, familial AD (FAD) and non-demented individuals) (Fig. 2, supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S7). While none of the non-demented controls showed plaque staining with 9D5, some specimen showed plaque staining using 4G8 (against A\u242417-24). Occasionally weak 9D5 blood vessel immunostaining was observed. This observation demonstrated that plaques in healthy controls do not harbor the 9D5 epitope and indicates that plaques in nondemented controls do not contain oligomeric A\u2424pE3. In contrast, most of the sporadic AD and FAD cases demonstrated high abundance of intraneuronal and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) staining with 9D5 (Fig. 2, A and B), clearly differing from the 4G8 pattern (e.g. sporadic case 1 and 2, Fig. 2A). FAD cases having mutations in the APP gene (Swedish or arctic mutation) revealed abundant 9D5 immunoreactivity. Of interest, all analyzed FAD cases harboring mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (P264L, L418F, PS1\u232cexon9) showed prominent intraneuronal 9D5 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B, supplemental Table S1). Oligomeric A\u2424pE3-42 antibody 9D5 showed a specific staining pattern different from the staining pattern with an antibody against the N terminus of A\u2424pE3-42 (supplemental Fig. S3)."

                        "Patients-To assess the diagnostic potential of oligomeric A\u2424pE3 variants and antibody 9D5, we established a novel ELISA and tested plasma of AD patients and healthy controls (HC). Interestingly, levels of \u2329\u2424p\u232d3 oligomers were significantly reduced in AD patients by 46% as compared with healthy controls (p \u03fd 0.05) (Fig. 2C). We have previously published that the level of IgM autoantibodies in plasma directed against A\u2424pE3 was significantly decreased in AD patients as compared with healthy controls. In good agreement with these observations, the signal of A\u2424pE3 oligomers detected by 9D5 was significantly lower in plasma of AD patients again pointing out that 9D5 can be used as a biomarker tool for AD diagnosis (36). We hypothesize that lower levels of A\u2424pE3 oligomers in plasma are due to development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and increased accumulation within neurons (supplemental Fig. S6). Aggregates were very rapidly generated from A\u2424pE3-42, indicating an instant seeding of the aggregation process. A\u24241-42 showed a typical lag phase, i.e. the phase in which oligomers and protofibrils are slowly formed, whereas A\u2424pE3-42 rapidly formed intermediate oligomeric assemblies, but has decreased propensity to form larger fibrils, a behavior that clearly differs from that of that of A\u24241-42. E, accelerated increase after the inflection point at 200 min was efficiently blocked by addition of 9D5 together with A\u2424pE3-42. F, toxicity measurements of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells incubated with A\u24241-42 and A\u2424pE3-42 in addition with 9D5 antibody compared with vehicle control. Whereas A\u24241-42 (with and without 9D5) and A\u2424pE3-42 displayed high toxic effects, A\u2424pE3-42 in the presence of 9D5 is not toxic (n \u03ed 3-5; ANOVA, p \u03ed 0.0001; followed by t test, p \u03ed 0.0048).",
                        "Antibody 9D5 Shows a Specific Staining Profile in Transgenic Alzheimer Mouse Models-We next asked the question whether oligomeric A\u2424pE peptides could also be detected in transgenic mouse models for AD. Staining of 3-month-old 5XFAD mice did not show any immunoreactivity (Fig. 3A), whereas considerable staining was detected in the subiculum of 6-month-old 5XFAD mice (Fig. 3B), showing a dramatic increase at the age of 12 months (Fig. 3C). 9D5 detected only intracellular and no plaque-associated staining corroborating the staining pattern in AD patients. In addition, other brain areas like cortex, pons or brainstem nuclei stained strongly positive at that time point (not shown). A very similar age-dependent accumulation of A\u2424pE3 was also observed in APP/ PS1KI mice, another model with robust neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits (23, 37) (supplemental Fig. S4). Double-staining using 9D5 (red) and the astrocytic marker GFAP (green) in the subiculum of 12-month-old 5XFAD mice revealed almost no co-localization in astrocytes (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, double-staining using 9D5 (red) and the microglia/macrophage marker Iba-1 (green) showed a strong co-localization, suggesting oligomeric A\u2424pE3 variants are internalized by microglia (arrowheads) (Fig. 3E). In addition, strong intraneuronal 9D5-immunoreactivity could be demonstrated (Fig. 3F, arrows). The finding of intraneuronal 9D5 staining is corroborated by strong 9D5-immunoreactivity in spinal cord motor neurons of aged APP/PS1KI mice (supplemental Fig. S4).",
                        "Therapeutic Effect of Passive Immunization with 9D5 in 5XFAD Mice-Next we studied a potential therapeutic effect of 9D5 using a passive immunization approach. 4.5month-old 5XFAD (female) mice were weekly injected with 250 g of 9D5 intraperitoneally for 6 weeks. 9D5 treatment significantly reduced generic A\u2424, A\u242442, A\u242440, and A\u2424pE3 plaque load in hippocampus (HC) and cortex (Ctx) (Fig. 4,  A andB). In good agreement, 9D5 treatment significantly stabilized the performance in the elevated plus maze (Fig. 4C). Confirming the plaque load data, a significant reduction of A\u2424pE3 levels was observed in both the TBS and SDS fraction of brain lysates after 9D5 immunization of 5XFAD mice (Fig. 4D). Passive immunization of 5XFAD mice with 9D5 showed reduction of the intracellular A\u2424pE3-42 oligomers (supplemental Fig. S5). "

                "Soluble oligomers (also described as ADDLs and/or protofibrils) of A\u2424 have been discussed to be causally involved in synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in the early stages of AD (38 -39). However, there is no consensus on which aggregation state exerts the highest toxicity in AD. Nanomolar concentrations of small diffusible A\u2424 oligomers (17-27 kDa) cause neuronal death in hippocampal slice cultures (40) and A\u2424 dimers that were either cell-derived or extracted from AD brains impair synaptic plasticity (41). On the other hand, dodecameric A\u242456* oligomers extracted from the brain of APP transgenic mice interfere with learning and memory performance in rat (42). Analysis of neurotoxicity of oligomers ranging from monomers to tetramers of synthetic A\u2424 peptides demonstrated that tetramers have the strongest effect (43). The conclusion that oligomers are more potent candidates as pathogens is based primarily on experimental evidence demonstrating that natural and synthetic A\u2424 oligomers impair synaptic plasticity (40 -41, 44), memory (33,42,44) and inducing loss of synapses (34,45) when applied exogenously into rat cerebral ventricle, cultured brain slices, or dissociated neurons. It has been shown that soluble oligomeric A\u242442 and not plaque-associated A\u2424 correlate best with cognitive dysfunction (7)(8). A\u2424 oligomers are formed preferentially intracellularly within neuronal processes and synapses rather than within the extracellular space (9 -10). Tomiyama et al. generated APP transgenic mice expressing the E693\u232c mutation, which causes neuronal cell death and cognitive impairment by enhanced A\u2424 oligomerization without fibrillization. The mice displayed age-dependent accumulation of intraneuronal A\u2424 oligomers from 8 months but no extracellular amyloid deposits even at 24 months. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory were impaired at 8 months of age (46). A\u2424 protofibril levels correlate with spatial learning in AD transgenic mice expressing human APP with the arctic mutation (47) facilitating early intraneuronal A\u2424 aggregation (48). Despite the difficulty to compare the different studies on oligomeric A\u2424 species there seems to be converging evidence that they: 1) are primarily formed within neurons, 2) oligomeric A\u2424 species are more neurotoxic than monomeric or fibrillar A\u2424 in vitro, and 3) oligomeric A\u2424 species decrease synaptic activity.",
                "In the present study, we have identified LMW A\u2424pE3 oligomers, which can be detected by 9D5, a novel mouse monoclonal antibody. 9D5 did not cross react with any A\u24241-42 species indicating that these oligomers present a unique and novel epitope. The therapeutic potential of 9D5 was demonstrated in passively immunized 5XFAD mice as plaque load and A\u2424 levels were reduced and behavioral deficits were normalized. In an ELISA using 9D5 as capture antibody, we could show that the signal was significantly lower in plasma of AD patients as compared with non-demented controls. We believe that our observation represents a novel therapeutic mechanism rescuing AD pathology and related behavioral deficits. Several studies demonstrated that N-terminal specific A\u2424 antibodies showed significant beneficial effect in AD mouse models. Bard et al. (26) and Buttini et al. (49) studied the optimal antibody response for reducing neuropathology in PDAPP transgenic mice. Immune sera with reactivity against different A\u2424 epitopes and monoclonal antibodies with different isotypes were examined for efficacy and showed that antibodies against the N-terminal regions of A\u2424 were able to invoke beneficial effects. Saido et al. (15) suggested that A\u2424pE3-42 is generated step-by-step from its precursor A\u24241-42 by N-truncation and glutamate to pyroglutamate formation. We therefore assume that reducing A\u24241-42 by passive immunization (reviewed in (50)) will also reduce A\u2424pE3-42 levels and the resulting oligomeric forms. We think that A\u2424pE3 oligomers represent an important pathological step appearing at a time point when behavioral deficits occur. Interrupting this toxic pathway by specifically reducing these oligomers also has an impact on other A\u2424 peptides as shown for example in reducing general plaque load. In conclusion, we have therefore demonstrated for the first time that oligomeric A\u2424pE peptides represent a novel A\u2424 entity, which mice showing that the signal starts to appear at 6 months. D, double staining using 9D5 (red) and the astrocytic marker GFAP (green) in the subiculum of a 12-month-old 5XFAD mouse revealed no colocalization in astrocytes. E, in contrast, double-staining using 9D5 (red) and the microglia/macrophage marker Iba-1 (green) showed a strong colocalization in the subiculum of a 12-month-old 5XFAD mouse (arrowheads). F, strong intraneuronal 9D5-immunoreactivity could be demonstrated in the pons of a 12-month-old 5XFAD mouse.",
