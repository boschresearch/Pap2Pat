                        "Intestinal inflammation, including colitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is caused by genetic and environmental factors that alter intestinal homeostasis. Many IBD-associated genetic loci regulate the recognition and killing of bacteria as well as the function of immune cells. In patients with IBD and colitis, there is an alteration in the composition and structure of the gut microbiota which includes a bloom of AIEC. Colonization by certain AIEC strains promotes the induction of colitis. Accordingly, compositions and methods are needed for the management of AIEC-associated intestinal inflammation, colitis and IBD."

                        "Provided herein are compositions and methods for the management of intestinal inflammation. In particular, compositions comprising modified adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) are administered to human and/or animal subjects to treat, prevent or decrease susceptibility to intestinal inflammation.",
                        "The surface of bacterial symbionts and pathogens is important for the interaction of these microorganisms with their hosts. On the cell surface, microbes express various conserved molecules, structures and antigens that can be recognized by the host immune system for microbe killing and eradication [1]. Conversely, many microbes can evade host recognition through the production of cell surface proteins and polysaccharides including the capsule (K-antigen) and lipopolysaccharide side chains (O-antigen) structures in Enterobacteriaceae [2, 3]. These bacterial polysaccharides confer resistance to the host immune system by inhibiting the binding of antibodies to microbial surface antigens and impairing complement-mediated phagocytosis [4, 5]. Thus, structural variation in surface polysaccharides produced by bacteria can affect the survival of microorganisms that invade host tissues as well as the susceptibility of the host to bacteremia and sepsis [6]. Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains produce specific K or O serotypes and are often resistant to host systemic immunity [7, 8], while intestinal pathogenic E. coli (InPEC) strains can cause or promote colitis, diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through their ability to interact with intestinal cells [9]. The host/bacterial interactions are primarily mediated by bacterial adhesive molecules and toxins, but the role of surface polysaccharides in the regulation of intestinal inflammation remains unknown.",
                        "Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is a group of InPEC that is associated with IBD including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [10, 11]. AIEC expresses surface adhesins including type I fimbriae that are important for its ability to interact with host cells and for biofilm formation [12]. Structural variation of FimH in type I fimbria is associated with higher ability of AIEC to adhere to and invade host cells [13]. Furthermore, the invasiveness properties of AIEC have been suggested to be important for evading recognition and elimination by the host immune system [14, 15]. These observations indicate that the resistance of AIEC to host recognition and elimination impacts bacterial survival and the ability of AIEC to promote intestinal inflammation.",
                        "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that IBD is caused by genetic and environmental factors that alter intestinal homeostasis in genetically susceptible individuals [16]. Many IBD-associated loci are known to regulate the recognition and killing of bacteria as well as the function of immune cells [17]. For example, IL23R and TNFSF15 that are critical for the activation of innate lymphoid cells 3 (ILC3) and Th17 cells, cell populations that are important for the maintenance of the intestinal barrier and tissue repair, are associated with IBD susceptibility [18, 19]. ILC3 and Th17 cells produce IL-22, a cytokine that mediates protective immune responses in infectious and chemically-induced colitis [20]. Upon enteric bacterial infection, IL-22 is produced locally in the intestine, but can also reach the liver where it acts on hepatocytes to induce the secretion of acute phase proteins including complement protein C3 [6, 21]. In patients with IBD and animal models of colitis, there is an alteration in the composition and structure of the gut microbiota which includes a bloom of AIEC [22, 23]. Furthermore, colonization by certain AIEC strains can promote the induction of colitis in IL10-deficient mice [24]. In experiments conducted in the development of the present invention , Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice were used to determine the role of surface lipopolysaccharide in the regulation of AIEC colonization and AIEC-associated colitis.",

                                "We used a chemically-induced colitis model in which oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) triggers epithelial damage and inflammation to investigate the role of the microbiota in colitis. To address the role of dysbiosis-associated colitis in the immunocompromised host, we used mice lacking IL-22, a cytokine that is important for immune protection at the intestinal barrier [25]. WT and Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice were pretreated with a cocktail of antibiotics for 6 days to induce dysbiosis prior to the administration of DSS. We assessed colitis by measuring body weight, colon length, histopathology and fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), a marker of intestinal inflammation [26]. We found that Il22\u2212/\u221260 mice pretreated with antibiotics showed more weight loss, more shortening of colon length, and greater fecal lipocalin-2 levels after DSS treatment than WT mice pretreated with antibiotics, and untreated WT or Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 1A to C). Consistent with these findings, higher pathology scores were found in the intestine of antibiotic-pretreated Il22\u2212-\u2212 mice than in antibiotic-treated WT mice and untreated mice (FIGS. 1D, E, and 6A). These results indicate that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis exacerbates DSS-induced colitis in the absence of IL-22.",
                                "To determine how antibiotic treatment affects the microbiota during DSS-induced colitis, we analyzed the composition of the microbiota using Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Consistent with previous studies [6, 27], treatment of Il22\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice with a cocktail of 7 antibiotics resulted in an increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae before and after treatment with DSS (FIG. 1F). The dominance of Enterobacteriaceae in antibiotic-treated Il22\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice was accompanied by an increase in Bacteroidaceae after DSS treatment (FIG. 1F). We confirmed that antibiotic treatment increases the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in both Il22\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice by quantitative PCR using specific primers (FIG. 6B). To identify bacteria associated with colitis, we determined the most dominant bacteria that are associated with increased fecal Lcn2 levels by Spearman ranking correlation analysis. We found that Escherichia was the most abundant genera associated with increased Lcn2 levels in the intestine (Spearman's ranking correlation coefficient=0.449, p<0.0014, average abundance=16.2%) (FIG. 1G). These results indicate that the blooming of certain Enterobacteriaceae species including E. coli is associated with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in WT and IL-22-deficient mice. Furthermore, IL-22 protects the host from dysbiosis-associated colitis in DSS-treated animals.",
                                "Colitis-Associated E. coli Isolates Belong to AIEC",
                                "To determine the role of Enterobacteriaceae that accumulate during antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in colitis, we isolated Enterobacteriaceae species from the intestine of antibiotic-treated Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice. Consistent with previous studies [27], bacteria belonging to Enterobacter and Escherichia were identified as dominant Enterobacteriaceae genera that bloom after treatment with antibiotics. To determine the role of the bacterial species in colitis, we isolated E. coli as the most abundant bacteria associated with increased Lcn2 levels in the intestine (FIG. 1G), and determined full genomic sequences of four independent E. coli isolates, NI1429, NI1413, NI1423 and NI1522. Analysis of their genomes showed that all of four strains belong to the B2-phylogroup (ChuA+YjaA+TSPE4.C2\u2212) which is common in human AIEC strains [13]. Furthermore, the four E. coli strains were genetically similar and showed high similarity to human AIEC strains when compared to \u2248600 reference E. coli strains by Roary (FIG. 7A). The four mouse E. coli isolates and human AIEC reference strains showed high homology in protein sequences (>91%) and their genomes contained a unique set of \u2248340 genes not found in the reference E. coli laboratory strain K-12 MG1655. These genes conserved in mouse and human AIEC strains include many putative virulence genes (FIG. 7B). In addition, the genomes of mouse AIEC isolates harbor genes encoding type I fimbrial proteins, invasin-like adhesins and strain-specific flagella. The polymorphisms of type I fimbrial protein FimH in the mouse isolates were identical to those reported to be important for adhesiveness and invasiveness in human AIEC [13]. These results indicate that E. coli isolated from colitic Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice possess genetic features that are characteristic of human AIEC.",
                                "The genetic evidence that colitis-associated E. coli mouse isolates exhibit multiple features of AIEC prompted investigation of whether these bacterial strains exhibit phenotypes characteristic of AIEC. To determine if the mouse E. coli isolates function as AIECs, we performed adhesion and invasion assays using T84 intestinal epithelial cells as described [28]. The colitis-associated E. coli isolates, NI1413 and NI1429 demonstrated the ability to adhere to and invade into T84 intestinal epithelial cells (FIGS. 2A and B). To verify the role of Fim type I fimbrial adherence in the AIEC phenotype, we deleted fimH in one of the mouse isolates by homologous recombination. Consistent with the important role of the type I fimbriae in the AIEC phenotype of the human LF82 strain [13], the adhesiveness and invasiveness of NI1429 was lost after deletion of fimH (FIGS. 2A and B). These results indicate that the murine isolates are AIECs.",
                                "**Colitis-Associated AIEC Possess High Ability to Outcompete Symbiotic Bacteria**",
                                "Further evaluation of bacterial genomes of colitis-associated E. coli isolates revealed that they contain putative genes involved in inter-species competition. These include genes for the production of colicins on plasmids, type VI secretion system (T6SS) effectors and factors for contact-dependent growth inhibition (FIG. 7B). These findings indicate that colitis-associated E. coli isolates have potential to outcompete other bacteria and acquire dominance under dysbiotic conditions. Because all four colitis-associated E. coli isolates contained plasmid-encoded colicins that act as antimicrobial peptides against competitive bacteria [29], we performed halo assays to determine the ability of the isolates to outcompete other enterobacteria by overlaying the competitors on target bacteria [29]. We found that two colitis-associated E. coli strains, NI1413 and NI1429, exhibited potent ability to outcompete other E. coli strains and related enterobacteria, including human AIECs and the mouse pathogen C. rodentium (FIG. 2C). To further characterize the role of colicins in bacterial competition, we deleted colY, a colicin gene in NI1429, a representative mouse AIEC isolate. In these experiments, we co-cultured ampicillin-resistant strain LF82, a reference human AIEC strain with streptomycin-resistant NI1429 derivatives (NI1429Str) including WT or an isogenic \u0394colY mutant. Consistent with the results of the halo assay, WT NI1429Str exhibits robust ability to inhibit the growth of LF82 and the inhibitory activity is dependent on the presence of colicin Y (FIG. 2D). These results indicate that colitis-associated E. coli are AIEC with high competitive ability against related enterobacteria.",
                                "**Intestinal AIEC Colonization is Regulated by the Surface Polysaccharide Layer and IL-22 Under Colitic Conditions**",
                                "A genetic feature of disease-associated E. coli strains is the presence of particular O- and K- serotypes, which reflect differences in the surface polysaccharide layer composed of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS), respectively. Both LPS and CPS provide resistance against complement-mediated defense mechanisms [4], and thus colitis-associated E. coli strains have the potential to be virulent in the host. In silico serotyping by Serotypefinder and BLAST showed that the serotypes of colitis-associated E. coli NI1429 and NI1522 were O54-like:K-:H45, whereas that of NI1413 was O7:K1:H7. To test whether the lipopolysaccharide O structure is important for sensitivity to complement and engulfment by phagocytes, we generated an isogenic mutant strain of NI1429 lacking the surface polysaccharide layer by deletion of the wzy gene (\u0394wzy) by homologous recombination and its plasmid-complemented strain (\u0394wzy+wzy) [30, 31]. Biochemical analysis confirmed that the wzy mutant lacks O-antigen of LPS and its complementation with a wzy plasmid restores O-antigen expression (FIG. 8A). Furthermore, the wzy mutant grew at a comparable rate to the WT strain in vitro, and its inhibitory activity against LF82 remained intact (FIGS. 8B and 8C). To assess the C3 binding ability, we compared C3-deposition levels on the E. coli NI1429 strain after incubation with fresh mouse serum as a source of C3. K-12 and NI1076 were used as complement sensitive and resistant controls, respectively [6]. Consistent with previous studies [32, 33], the wzy AIEC mutant conjugated more C3 than the parental WT strain and the wzy complemented mutant strain (FIGS. 3A and B). Furthermore, the wzy mutant showed increased engulfment by bone marrow-derived macrophages and susceptibility to killing by peritoneal neutrophils compared with the WT strain (FIG. 3C and D). In addition, the wzy mutant showed reduced ability to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells in vitro compared with the WT strain (FIGS. 3D and E). These results indicate that the surface polysaccharide layer, which depends on wzy, is critical for resistance to complement and phagocyte killing in colitis-associated E. coli.",
                                "Next, we tested if the wzy mutant is sensitive to host elimination during colitis in vivo. To this end, we pre-treated the mice with streptomycin for 1 day to deplete the microbiota, and then co-inoculated the mice orally with an equal mixture of streptomycin-resistant WT NI1429 and its isogenic \u0394wzy mutant strain. In the absence of DSS treatment, the fitness of the \u0394wzy mutant to colonize the gut decreased less than one log in mock-treated mice, compared with the WT strain (FIG. 3E). In contrast, the colonization fitness of the \u0394wzy mutant decreased \u02dc3 logs compared with the WT strain after 7 days of DSS treatment (FIG. 3E). Furthermore, the competitive index of the \u0394wzy mutant improved in Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice after DSS treatment when compared with that observed in DSS-treated WT mice (FIGS. 3E and 9A). Previous studies showed that IL-22 limits the systemic colonization of bacterial symbionts through the regulation of the complement system [6]. We found that IL-22 mRNA levels were increased in the colon of DSS-treated WT mice (FIG. 9B). Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses showed increased levels of C3 mRNA in the liver and C3 protein in serum of DSS-treated WT mice (FIG. 9C and D). Consistent with previous studies [6], induction of C3 mRNA in the liver and C3 protein in the serum was largely dependent on IL-22 in DSS-treated mice (FIG. 9C and D). These results indicate that the \u0394wzy mutant AIEC exhibits reduced ability to colonize the intestine under colitic conditions, and indicate that IL-22 limits the colonization of the \u0394wzy mutant in the inflamed intestine.",

                                "We next assessed whether the \u0394wzy mutant AIEC is protective against intestinal inflammation. To test this, we pretreated with streptomycin for 1 day and then inoculated the mice orally with streptomycin-resistant WT or \u0394wzy mutant NI1429 strains in the presence of DSS in the drinking water for 7 days. The colonization levels of the WT strain and the \u0394wzy mutant strain were comparable after 1, 3 and 7 days of DSS treatment (FIG. 4A). Furthermore, mice colonized with the WT bacterium and the \u0394wzy mutant showed comparable weight loss early after DSS treatment, but mice colonized with the \u0394wzy mutant showed reduced weight loss after 7 days of DSS treatment (FIG. 4B). The reduced weight loss in mice colonized with the \u0394wzy mutant was associated with decreased colon shortening and pathology scores when compared with mock-treated or mice colonized with the WT strain (FIGS. 4C to E, and 10A). Analysis of bacterial loads showed increased numbers of the WT NI1429 strain compared with the isogenic \u0394wzy mutant strain in the mesenteric lymph nodes (FIG. 10B). These results indicate that the lipopolysaccharide O side chain of AIEC regulates intestinal inflammation.",
                                "**Host Protection Against Colitis by the wzy Mutant Depends on Complement C3**",
                                "We first examined whether the protective ability of the E. coli \u0394wzy mutant against DSS-induced colitis was associated with changes in the immune populations of the lamina propia in the large intestine. Mice colonized with the \u0394wzy mutant and mock contained similar numbers of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells in the intestinal tissue after DSS treatment (FIG. 11). To determine whether reduced colitis associated with colonization by the \u0394wzy mutant depends on C3, we depleted C3 in WT B6 mice by intraperitoneal administration of cobra venom factor (CVF) [34]. C3 depletion was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis (FIG. 12A), and macrophage engulfment assay that relies on C3 (FIG. 12B). Importantly, treatment with CVF blocked the ability of the \u0394wzy mutant to protect against DSS-induced colitis as assessed by weight loss, colon length and pathology scores (FIG. 5A to D, and 12C). To determine if C3 mediates the protective role of the \u0394wzy mutant against colitis by regulating bacterial numbers, we assessed the colonization levels of the \u0394wzy mutant bacterium over time after DSS treatment. After C3 depletion, the loads of the \u0394wzy mutant were \u02dc50-fold higher in mice treated with CVF than in mock-treated mice after 7 days of DSS treatment (FIG. 5E). In contrast, the intestinal loads of the \u0394wzy mutant was comparable after 1 and 3 days of DSS treatment in the presence and absence of C3 depletion. These results indicate that the anti-inflammatory effect of the \u0394wzy mutant is dependent on the host complement system.",
                                "These results indicate that Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in the presence of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Treatment of mice with multiple antibiotics induced accumulation of particular bacterial strains belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family that include AIEC. Such bacteria exhibited unique genetic traits including the presence of polymorphisms of type I fimbriae tip adhesin FimH, genes producing T6SS effectors, genes associated with anti-bacterial immunity such as colicin-containing plasmids and genes for contact-dependent growth inhibition. While colonization of mice with WT AIEC did not exacerbate DSS-induced colitis, an AIEC mutant deficient in wzy that encodes an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the surface polysaccharide layer, surprisingly conferred protection against intestinal inflammation and colitis. Resistance of bacteria to host defense responses is dependent, at least in part, on structures present on the bacterial surface and in particular - and K- serotypes expressed by enterobacteria [4]. In pathogenic enterobacteria, these polysaccharide structures are associated with bacterial virulence and fitness at invasion sites [35, 36]. We observed that the protective function of surface polysaccharide synthesized by Wzy is primarily found under inflamed conditions, suggesting a role for host immune factors in the regulation of wzy-dependent bacterial fitness. Previous work showed that O- and K-serotypes are important for virulence and resistance to host elimination in ExPEC including uropathogenic and neonatal meningitis-associated E. coli [37-39]. However, the role of surface polysaccharides of intestinal commensal pathogenic E. coli (InPEC), including AIEC, in the regulation of intestinal colonization has not been previously identified. Our findings indicate that the sensitivity of an InPEC strain such as NI1429 to complement is critical for regulation of disease activity in the intestine. Consistent with this determination, the loss of surface polysaccharides by the wzy deficiency in AIEC alleviates the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and colitis. Mutations potentially acquired during the generation of streptomycin-resistant E. coli strains could contribute to the protective phenotype in vivo. Probiotic Nissle 1917, a human E. coli strain, which has been widely used as a non-pathogenic, non-AIEC probiotic strain has a wzy mutation [32]. Nissle 1917 produces microcins H47 and M which has been suggested to mediate its ability to outcompete other bacteria and reduce colitis [40, 41]. Contrary to probiotic, non-AIEC strains, our evidence shows that the ability of modified AIEC strains to outcompete other bacteria via the production of colicins under colitic conditions may be harnessed for the generation of therapeutic modified AIEC strains. Because such mutants occupy the same ecological niche that WT AIEC and related bacteria inhabit, replacement of pro-inflammatory WT bacteria with mutant AIEC strains such as those harboring the wzy mutation is beneficial in reducing inflammatory activity. Non-AIEC, probiotic Nissle 1917 may outcompete other bacteria through diverse mechanisms [41-44] that may further be shared with modified/mutant AIEC strains.",
                                "These data indicate that the protective function of the wzy mutant against intestinal inflammation and colitis depends in part on C3. Depletion of C3 results in an increased abundance of E. coli in the intestine of DSS-treated, but not untreated mice, indicating that C3 regulates the number of E. coli in the intestine only under colitic conditions. Because C3 can be found in intestinal contents [45, 46], the effect of C3 to regulate E. coli abundance may be mediated by C3 released into the intestinal lumen, although claims of the present invention are not limited to one mechanism or to any mechanism. Several approaches using non-AIEC, probiotic bacteria have been proposed for the treatment of IBD [47]. These include the use of bacterial strains such as non-AIEC Nissle 1917 that were selected by functional screens for effectiveness in clinical trials. Non-AIEC Nissle 1917 has been used to promote the maintenance of remission in UC patients [48]. Our findings demonstrate that the therapeutic benefits of the wzy mutant of colitis-associated AIEC NI1429 may rely in part on host immune factors including C3, indicating that effective use of a modified AIEC strains based on the wzy mutation also may rely in part on the presence of a normal immune system, and in particular on an intact complement system. Although the beneficial effect of the \u0394wzy mutant AIEC strain may rely in part on an intact complement system, the precise mechanism is not yet known, and is not necessary to make or to practice the present invention. For example, complement-sensitive bacteria with a high capacity to outcompete other bacteria may decrease pro-inflammatory bacteria, and enable the host to eliminate translocated bacteria via C3.",

                                "Targeted deletion of wzy of LF82 and GT of NI1429 was performed by homologous recombination using the pKD46 system as described [63]. Briefly, NI1429 was transformed with pKD46, and the chromosomal genes were replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette from the plasmid pKD3 plasmid using a PCR fragment amplified with primers: LF82 Wzy 5 (SEQ ID NO: 29), LF82 Wzy 3 (SEQ ID NO: 30), NI1429 GT 5 (SEQ ID NO: 31), and NI1429 GT 3 (SEQ ID NO: 32). The chloramphenicol (Kan) resistance cassette was removed using the pCP20 plasmid. Deletion of the target gene and the removal of Cm gene was confirmed by PCR.",
                                "C3 deposition Western blotting assays were performed as described. [64] Briefly, 5\u00d7108 bacteria were incubated in 50% (v/v) mouse serum for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. Unbound C3 was removed from bacterial pellets by washing with ice-cold PBS. Samples and control 1/200 total reaction mixtures were boiled in Laemmli's buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (1\u00d7108 bacteria per lane). For C3 deposition, C3 protein was examined by immunoblotting using anti-mouse C3d antibody (R&D). For equal loading, bacterial aliquots from each sample were plated and the same number of CFUs were lysed. As shown in FIG. 13(A), in bacteria present in humans, the mutation is associated with increased complement deposition on the bacterial surface. These results indicate that methods and compositions of the present invention generate mutant bacteria of utility in treating intestinal inflammation in humans. As shown in FIG. 13(B), inactivation of another gene in the shared metabolic pathway (i.e., GT, glycosyltransferase in the lipoploysaccaride O synthetic pathway) regulates complement deposition. These results indicate that inactivation of constituents in a shared metabolic pathway other than wzy generates of bacteria of clinical utility."

                                "The chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance cassette was removed using the pCP20 plasmid except for NI1429str\u0394wzy::Cm. Deletion of the target gene and removal of Cm gene was confirmed by PCR using primers listed in Table 2. For complementation, the full open reading frame (ORF) of the gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of NI1429 parent strain by PCR using primers shown in Table 2. The ORF was inserted into pGEM-T Easy by commercial TA-cloning kit (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by the transformation into the wzy mutants. The endogenous plasmid pNI1429 was isolated from NI1429 using a commercial kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The ampicillin gene was amplified from pGEM-T Easy by using Amp5Bam and Amp3XhoI and inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of pNI1429 to generate pNI1429Amp. The mutant plasmid pNI1429Amp\u0394Col lacking the region containing colY gene, was generated by the removal of EcoRI fragments in the colY gene. The constructs pNI1429Amp and pNI1429Amp\u0394Col were confirmed using primer sets shown in Table 2. Strains carrying the resultant plasmids were generated by transformation of the NI1429Str with the plasmids and successive culture on L-broth plates containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin until loss of the endogenous pNI1429 and monitoring with Y5Bam/Y3XbaI. Authenticity of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing.",

For genomic sequencing, genomic DNA of bacteria was isolated as described [51] and subjected to random sequencing by Illumina MiSeq. The resulted paired-end sequences were assembled to contigs by Velvet [52], and genes were annotated by Prokka [53] after quality check. Ortholog gene groups and the phylogenetic tree distances of E. coli strains were determined by roary [54], after reannotating reference genomes, which are available in GenBank, by Prokka. For microbiota composition analysis, bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse feces using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) as instructed by the manufacturer. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (252 bp) was sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq, and analyzed by using Mothur [55, 56]. OTUs were classified into taxons at >97% identity with the use of Mothur [55]. We also used OTUs at 100% identity to determine detailed bacterial taxons by BLASTN. Spearman ranking analysis was performed using otu.association of Mothur after adding normalization for Lcn2 level and OTU abundance. Bacterial serotypes were determined using genomic sequences and SerotypeFinder (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/serotypefinder/). Phylogroups of the isolates were determined by the presence of ChuA, yjaA and TSPE4.C2 [57]. To determine the most associated co-abundance group (CAGs) with Lcn2 levels, logarithmic values of OTU abundance and Lcn2 level were clustered with MeV (http://www.tm4.org/) by a complete linkage method using Pearson's squared correlation coefficients. The distant tree was visualized by iTol (https://itol.embl.de/).",
