    "title": "Dual Inhibition of BMP and WNT Signals Promotes Pancreatic Differentiation from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells",

    "abstract": "Pathological or functional loss of pancreatic beta cells is the cause of diabetes. Understanding how signaling pathways regulate pancreatic lineage and searching for combinations of signal modulators to promote pancreatic differentiation will definitely facilitate the robust generation of functional beta cells for curing hyperglycemia. In this study, we first tested the effect of several potent BMP inhibitors on pancreatic differentiation using human embryonic stem cells. Next, we examined the endodermal lineage bias upon potent BMP inhibitor treatment and further checked the crosstalk between signal pathways governing endodermal lineage determination. Furthermore, we improved current pancreatic differentiation system based on the signaling pathway study. Finally, we used human-induced pluripotent stem cells to validate our finding. We found BMP inhibitors indeed not only blocked hepatic lineage but also impeded intestinal lineage from human definitive endoderm unexpectedly. Signaling pathway analysis indicated potent BMP inhibitor resulted in the decrease of WNT signal activity and inhibition of WNT could contribute to the improved pancreatic differentiation. Herein, we combined the dual inhibition of BMP and WNT signaling and greatly enhanced human pancreatic progenitor differentiation as well as beta cell generation from both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Conclusively, our present work identified the crosstalk between the BMP and WNT signal pathways during human endoderm patterning and pancreas specification, and provided an improved in vitro pancreatic directed differentiation protocol from human pluripotent stem cells.",

                "Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to the loss of either beta cell mass or beta cell function and could lead to severe metabolic syndrome. There are around 425 million diabetes patients in the world, and the number is increasing according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) 2017 report. Traditional methods of treating diabetes include burdensome daily insulin-sensitizing drugs or insulin injection, which can only alleviate symptoms of hyperglycemia, but cannot maintain normaglycemia continually and thus fail to fundamentally cure diabetes. Islet transplantation provides an effective and reliable strategy to replace the damaged cells, but is largely limited by the shortage of cadaveric islet source [1].",
                "Human pluripotent stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), could form multiple cell types and tissues composing of our body [2, 3]. Therefore, production of functional beta cells from human ESCs or iPSCs could be a promising choice for the cell replacement therapy of diabetes. A lot of efforts have been put in the last decades to direct human pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into functional beta cells in vitro and remarkable progresses have been recently achieved [4\u20139]. In order to generate robust beta cells from ESCs which represent the embryonic epiblast stage, pancreatic specification from differentiated definitive endoderm is a key point for the subsequent step [10]. The Nodal signaling pathway has been revealed as the main regulator of endoderm generation, but further endoderm patterning is more complicated and lacks of detailed studies in terms of signal combinations regulating individual endodermal lineage [11]. Retinoic acid (RA) is a well-known pathway to be utilized to direct pancreas specification, which also facilitates liver progenitor development [5, 12]. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is required for hepatic specification from definitive endoderm both in human and mouse [13, 14]. NOGGIN, an inhibitory protein of BMP signaling, is thus utilized in pancreatic differentiation together with RA [4, 5, 8]. In addition, more potent compounds targeting the same pathway have been reported, such as retinoid analog TTNPB to replace the endogenous version all-trans RA [15] and LDN for NOGGIN [6, 7].",
                "Previously, we have established a chemically defined protocol to direct human ESCs and iPSCs to differentiate into pancreatic lineage [5, 9, 16], and performed RNA sequencing analysis which pointed out BMP signaling as a downregulated pathway during pancreatic lineage specification from human ESC-derived definitive endoderm [17]. Therefore, here we tested several more stable and powerful chemical compounds targeting the BMP pathway to further promote pancreatic differentiation efficiency, and identified LDN193189 and K02288 indeed improving PDX1-positive pancreatic progenitor differentiation while surprisingly decreased CDX2-positive population. Since CDX2-positive cells represent intestine/colon lineages which are usually driven by the WNT signaling pathway, we had examined the crosstalk between the BMP and WNT signal pathways. Our data suggested that BMP inhibitors led to lower WNT activity and suppressed WNT signaling facilitated pancreatic lineage differentiation. Finally, we combined the dual treatment and observed the dual inhibition of BMP and WNT largely promoted pancreatic progenitor differentiation and beta cell generation."

By focusing on the pancreatic lineage specification stage (i.e., from definitive endoderm to pancreatic progenitor), we found the BMP signaling pathway significantly enriched [17]. NOGGIN, as a well-recognized BMP antagonist, has been broadly used in previous protocols [4, 5, 8] and effectively directed pancreatic differentiation. However, considering the cost and efficacy, we performed a small test for chemical compounds inhibiting the BMP and TGFbeta signaling pathway, including LDN193189 (Selleck, S2618) targeting ALK2/3 which was already used in a previous report [6], K02288 (Selleck, S7359) blocking ALK1/2/3/6, LDN214117 (Selleck, S7627) exclusively targeting ALK2, and Dorsomorphin (Compound C, Selleck, S7840) recognized as BMP inhibitor and AMPK inhibitor.

PDX1 is one of the most important transcription factors to specify pancreatic fate and beta cell maturation [19]; herein, we examined the ratio of PDX1-positive cells at progenitor stage by immunofluorescence assay and later quantitatively confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. The immunostaining data indicated LDN193189 treatment induced the most PDX1-positive cells (). The flow cytometric analysis revealed that K02288 and LDN193189 were vigorous candidates with around 25% PDX1-positive cells, compared to less than 10% for NOGGIN (Figure 1(b), ).

We observed that the percentage of PDX1-positive cells greatly increased after BMPi treatment by immunofluorescence (Figure 1(c), ), which was further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 1(d), ). Since NKX6-1-expressing cells within PDX1-positive population indicated the bona fide pancreatic progenitors [4, 6, 7], we also checked NKX6-1, showing upregulated expression in the BMPi treatment group both in protein and mRNA levels (Figures 1(c), 1(e), and 1(f), ).",

Since the liver, intestine, and stomach are derived from posterior foregut, the same as the pancreas [20], we determined the expression of hepatic marker AFP and intestinal marker CDX2 as well as gastric marker SOX2. The data indicated both the percentage of AFP-positive cells (Figures 1(c) and 1(d),  and ) and mRNA level of AFP (Figure 1(e), ) dramatically decreased as expected, as BMP is the major inducer of hepatic lineage [13, 14].

                        "To understand the result that BMPi promoted pancreatic differentiation and inhibited intestinal differentiation (Figure 1), we investigated whether inhibition of BMP signaling during pancreatic differentiation affected the WNT signaling pathway, which was considered as the major inducer of intestinal lineage [21]. First, we checked the expression levels of downstream genes to evaluate the activity of the WNT signaling pathway. The data showed all checked canonical WNT downstream genes, including WNT3, TWIST1, AXIN2, and MYC, and exhibited significant downregulation after inhibiting BMP (Figure 2(a),  for another BMP inhibitor K02288), indicating lower WNT signaling activity. Then, we checked the protein level and phosphorylation level of beta-catenin, the main effector of the WNT signaling pathway. Cytosolic beta-catenin phosphorylation/degradation is the essence of WNT signaling [22]. Phosphorylation of beta-catenin at serine 37 and serine 33 by GSK3 will lead to its ubiquitination and degradation [23], while hyperphosphorylation on tyrosine residues will make beta-catenin dissociate from N-cadherin and being on-state situation [24]. Thus, nonphosphorylated beta-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) or Y489-phosphorylated beta-catenin represents nuclear-bound activated form to determine WNT/beta-catenin activity. Therefore, we collected the cell lysate to examine protein expression and the results showed the BMPi treatment group exhibiting higher PDX1 protein level and lower active beta-catenin protein level albeit unchanged total beta-catenin level (Figure 2(b)). We further looked into the coexpression and subcellular localization of beta-catenin and active beta-catenin with PDX1, respectively (Figures 2(c) and 2(d), ). The total beta-catenin protein showed no difference in the control or BMPi group in both PDX1-positive cells and PDX1-negative cells (Figure 2(c)), as beta-catenin is not only the downstream of WNT signal but also the cytoskeletal structure protein with Ca2+-dependent CAMs [24]. In contrast, nucleus-located activated beta-catenin signals indeed decreased in BMPi condition compared with control (Figure 2(d), ). Furthermore, the PDX1-positive cells exhibited apparently much weaker staining of beta-catenin in the nucleus, suggesting lower activity of WNT signaling, while PDX1-negative cells had upregulated nucleus-located beta-catenin protein, suggesting higher activity of WNT signaling (Figure 2(d), ). Taken together, these data suggested the inhibition of BMP led to lower activity of the WNT signal pathway."

Immunofluorescence data showed that dual inhibition resulted in the higher ratio of INSULIN-positive cells costained with PDX1 or NKX6-1 (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Since Pro-INSULIN is the precursor for INSULIN maturation and thus represents the de novo production of INSULIN, we examined the expression of Pro-INSULIN. The results showed the \u201cDual i\u201d group resulting in much higher positive cells for Pro-INSULIN with PDX1 (Figure 5(c)). We further surveyed the RNA expression level and indeed dual inhibition treatment exhibited higher expression levels of PDX1, NKX6-1, and INSULIN genes (Figure 5(d))."

                        "We chose another cell line human iPSC PGP1 to evaluate the common role of the signaling crosstalk between BMP and WNT during pancreatic specification. We first generated definitive endoderm cells and treated with BMP inhibitor LDN193189 along with pancreatic specification condition. Similarly, LDN193189 significantly increased PDX1-positive cells and greatly decreased CDX2-positive cells as expected (Figure 6(a)). Consistent with this observation, the protein level of active beta-catenin in the BMPi group was significantly lower than the control group while there was no change for the total beta-catenin level (Figure 6(b)). The expression levels of canonical WNT target genes including WNT3, TWIST1, AXIN2, and MYC were downregulated in the BMPi group (Figure 6(c)). These data indicated lower WNT activity appearing upon BMP inhibition, which was the same as that we observed in human ESCs (Figure 2).",
                        "We further utilized the combination of dual inhibition of BMP and WNT signaling for pancreatic differentiation and performed the flow cytometric analysis. The result showed \u201cDual i\u201d indeed increased the PDX1-positive cells in progenitor stage (Figure 6(d)). Consistently, immunostaining result indicated dual inhibition of BMP and WNT generating much higher PDX1-and NKX6-1-double positive cells at progenitor stage (Figure 6(e)). We further evaluated the beta cell differentiation efficiency by RT-qPCR and immunostaining assays. Dual inhibition largely improved the mRNA expression levels of PDX1 and INSULIN (Figure 6(f)). Similarly, dual inhibition of BMP and WNT generated much higher PDX1- and INSULIN-double positive and PDX1-positive cells in iPSC (Figure 6(g))."

                        "Since dual inhibition of BMP and WNT resulted in higher PDX1- or NKX6-1- with INSULIN- or Pro-INSULIN-double positive cells, we next examined the beta cell identity. First, we performed more costaining to confirm PDX1 and NKX6-1 coexpressed with C-Peptide (Figure 7(a)). In addition, the expression of INSULIN/C-Peptide was exclusive, because INSULIN/C-Peptide-positive cells were not expressing GLUCAGON (Figure 7(b)), but indeed costained with secretory protein CHGA (Chromogranin A) (Figure 7(c)). By further quantitative flow cytometric analysis, approximately 21% of cells coexpressed INSULIN and PDX1 in differentiated beta cells, and 25% of cells were PDX1 and Pro-INSULIN-double positive cells (Figure 7(d)). The most important functional feature of beta cells is the capacity to secret INSULIN response to stimuli such as glucose and KCl. We challenged the differentiated beta cells with 20\u2009mM glucose and we found the differentiated cells secreted INSULIN upon high glucose stimulation with around 2.5 \u00b1 1.3-fold than basal glucose treatment. C-Peptide analysis also indicated the differentiated cells released more C-Peptide in high glucose (1.5 \u00b1 0.8-fold) and KCl (1.6 \u00b1 1.9-fold) conditions compared to basal glucose level (Figure 7(e)). Taken together, the differentiated beta cells through dual inhibition of BMP and WNT indeed exhibited the characteristic of functional beta cells."

                "Our present study reported an unexpected but important result that BMP inhibition could repress WNT activity during pancreatic differentiation (Figures 1 and 2,  and ) and dual inhibition treatment of BMP and WNT signals could greatly promote pancreatic differentiation from human ESCs (Figures 4 and 5) and iPSCs (Figure 6) as well. This finding not only facilitated the pancreatic beta cell generation for potential cell therapy and disease modeling but also highlighted the importance of crosstalk among signaling pathways in cell fate determination.",
                "Endodermal organ patterning was a very complicated process. Primitive gut tube could be simply divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut according to the anterior-posterior position. Later, foregut experienced a complicated fate determination process and formed the whole respiratory organ systems and the upper digestive system. In particular, the generation of the stomach, pancreas, liver, and intestine derived from a common pool of progenitors in the foregut endoderm, requiring the precise combinations of different signal pathways. BMP was not only required for hepatic specification from definitive endoderm both in human and mouse [13, 14] but also contributed to the posterization of gut tube patterning by upregulating the hindgut marker CDX2 and repressing the anterior gut marker SOX2 [25]. RA had been widely used to induce posterior foregut and pancreatic lineage [4\u20137, 9]. It had been reported RA treatment resulted in the expression of hepatic marker AFP when added directly to the Activin A-induced human ESCs [5, 12]. Therefore, the combination of RA and BMP inhibitor was expected to promote pancreatic lineage specification, which had been evidenced by multiple groups [4, 5, 8]. Our present data also demonstrated inhibition of BMP by various different chemicals greatly repressed hepatic lineage and facilitated pancreatic lineage differentiation in general (Figure 1, ).",
                "Furthermore, our results revealed that BMP inhibition reduced WNT activity during human endodermal patterning (Figure 2, ). Consistent with our observation, there were several studies indicating the crosstalk between the BMP and WNT signal pathways in different animal models or developmental contexts. During caudal vein formation in zebrafish, BMP induced the expression of AGGF1, a beta-catenin transcriptional cofactor which activated beta-catenin and WNT activity [26]. Roarty and Serra demonstrated that TGFbeta regulated the expression of wingless-related protein family Wnt5a in tumor progression and metastasis [27]. Placencio and colleagues showed TGFbeta signaling mediated prostatic response by paracrine WNT activity [28]. In rat neuronal differentiation from hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells, BMP2 and BMP4 induced neurogenesis in a WNT-dependent manner. Furthermore, BMP also cooperated with WNT signaling to specify neuronal fate specification [29]. In addition, BMP2 could induce the WNT and planar cell polarity pathways to contribute to vascular smooth muscle motility [30]. A combinational treatment with BMP inhibitors (Noggin and Gremlin) and WNT inhibitor Frzb could give rise to the cranial muscle anlagen and promote myogenesis [31]. In a recent report, activation of BMP signaling was found to be required and together with WNT signaling to direct differentiated gut tube into colonic organoids [32]. In addition, Wei and colleagues recently reported that TGFbeta signaling desensitized basal cells from growth inhibitory effect of stromal WNT signaling in prostate epithelial progenitor [33]. Our results together suggested that BMP inhibitor promoted pancreatic differentiation possibly through two pathways: the well-known direct inhibitory effect for hepatic lineage and the indirect inhibitory effect for intestinal lineage mainly through inhibiting WNT signaling [21]. Our data indicated that BMP inhibition could decrease WNT activity and together promoted pancreatic differentiation, though how BMP inhibition resulted in decreased WNT activity during endodermal patterning remained to be dissected in future study.",
                "Canonical WNT plays a key role in endoderm differentiation along with Nodal signal, whereas its upregulation is also required for gut lineage after endoderm [21]. Very recently, McCracken and colleagues reported that activated WNT signaling also promoted gastric fund differentiation in both rodents and human [34]. They observed that in E10.5 Shh-cre; beta-cateninfl/fl mouse embryos, beta-catenin was deleted in foregut-derived stomach budding region; the prestomach region was completely mispatterned with ectopic PDX1 expression [34]. This observation strongly suggested endogenous WNT signaling blocked pancreatic lineage specification. In addition, although WNT and BMP were generally considered to promote hindgut differentiation [21, 35], both of them played more complicated roles in the precise regulation of cell fate determination for different organ buds. We had determined the effect of WNT inhibitor only, compared to BMP inhibitor only and dual inhibitors (Figure 3). WNT inhibition alone indeed showed improved effect in terms of promoting pancreatic lineage marker expression, which was consistent with a recent report [36]; however, dual inhibition exhibited much better expression levels of pancreatic markers and more PDX1- and INSULIN-positive cells ().",
                "Taken together, these data combined with our study point out that precise combination, rather than one single signal self, determined the organ patterning. Understanding the precise signal crosstalk between WNT and BMP has greatly helped the directed pancreatic differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells."
