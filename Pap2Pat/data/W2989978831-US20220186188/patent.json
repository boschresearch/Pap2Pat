                        "Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood sugar. Whether insufficient insulin secretion caused by the lack of \u03b2 cells due to immune damage (T1D) or elevated blood sugar caused by insulin resistance (T2D) will eventually cause \u03b2 cell damage (Lam and Cherney, 2018). According to a report by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) in 2017, there have been currently 425 million diabetic patients, and this large population of patients may increase to 629 million by 2045. Diabetes is no longer a health risk issue, and it has already become a global social crisis. Diabetes not only causes elevated blood sugar, but also leads to complications, which brings various burdens to the families and the society. At present, therapies for diabetes includes oral hypoglycemic drugs, insulin injections, insulin pumps, etc. Traditional therapies can only alleviate high blood sugar symptoms of diabetes, but cannot fundamentally cure diabetes. In 2000, Shapiro et al. carried out pancreatic islet isolation and transplantation, combined with appropriate immunosuppressive protocols, and achieved an insulin-independent efficacy (Shapiro et al., 2000), and excellent effects were also achieved in follow-up observations (McCall and Shapiro, 2012). Methods of pancreatic islet transplantation can fundamentally cure diabetes; however, due to the extreme lack of donors, the method has not become the main therapies for diabetes. Embryonic stem cells, as a type of stem cells with multi-directional differentiation potential, can be induced in vitro by associated small chemical molecules and cell growth factors to obtain relatively mature and functional tissues or organs. The method for obtaining tissues and organs by means of the directional differentiation of stem cells can also be used for the treatment of diabetes, thereby providing a new solution to the shortage of donors. It can be seen that how to obtain a large number of functional pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells from embryonic stem cells will greatly benefit cell therapies of diabetes.",
                        "The expression levels of specific markers can be used for indicating the differentiation stage and maturity of cells. The characteristic transcription factor markers of pancreatic progenitor cells are co-expressed pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) and NK6 homeobox protein 1 (NKX6-1), wherein the expression of PDX1 indicates the differentiation of the cells towards the pancreas, and the expression of PDX1 and NKX6-1 indicates the differentiation of the cells into pancreatic progenitor cells. They are key markers during the development of the human pancreas. The characteristic markers of pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells are continuous expression of the transcription factor PDX1 and insulin (INS), and the co-expression of the transcription factor PDX1 and INS indicates the maturation of pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells.",
                        "WNT signaling pathway is one of the most important signaling mechanisms in cells. Activation of this signaling pathway can cause the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus, and the binding of \u03b2-catenin to transcription factors such as TCF can regulate transcription and expression of the downstream gene, thereby affecting cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. Therefore, the WNT signaling pathway also plays a vital role in early embryonic development and organ formation.",
                        "Due to the complexity of the differentiation into the pancreas and pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells and the differences between various systems, it is difficult to obtain a reproducible and efficient protocol of pancreatic islet cell differentiation, and it is impossible to obtain a large number of stable pancreatic progenitor cells."
