### Example 1 Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells into Pancreatic Progenitor Cells and Mature Pancreatic Islet β Cells by Induction of the WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor XAV-939

- differentiate human embryonic stem cells into definitive endoderm cells
- induce differentiation of definitive endoderm cells into pancreatic progenitor cells
- further differentiate pancreatic progenitor cells to obtain pancreatic islet β cells
- detect expression of PDX1 in pancreatic progenitor cell stage by flow cytometry
- detect relative expression of mRNAs of PDX1, NKX6-1, and INS by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR
- detect expression of PDX1 protein in pancreatic progenitor cell stage by immunofluorescence
- detect expression of PDX1/INS proteins in mature pancreatic islet β cell stage by immunofluorescence
- summarize results of cell differentiation and detection

### Example 2 Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells into Pancreatic Progenitor Cells and Pancreatic Islet β Cells by Induction of the WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor IWR-1

- differentiate human embryonic stem cells into definitive endoderm cells
- induce differentiation of definitive endoderm cells into pancreatic progenitor cells
- further differentiate pancreatic progenitor cells to obtain pancreatic islet β cells
- detect expression of PDX1 in pancreatic progenitor cell stage by flow cytometry
- detect relative expression of mRNAs of PDX1, NKX6-1, and INS by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR
- detect expression of PDX1 protein in pancreatic progenitor cell stage by immunofluorescence
- detect expression of PDX1/INS proteins in mature pancreatic islet β cell stage by immunofluorescence
- analyze results to show increased number of mature pancreatic islet β cells

### Example 3 Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells into Pancreatic Progenitor Cells and Mature Pancreatic Islet β Cells by Induction of the WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor XAV-939

- differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells into definitive endoderm cells
