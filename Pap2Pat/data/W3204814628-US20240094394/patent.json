                        "In recent years, there has been the rapid development of fast-spatial scanners in robotics, autonomous vehicles and other applications benefiting from fast-spatial scanning. Designing accurate and efficient scanning systems has been challenging in terms of both hardware (i.e., circuitry) and software since real-time response requires very fast information collection and processing. For ease of discussion, LiDAR is used as one such technology type which involves optical scanning to send (e.g., deflect) one or more laser beams onto different sampling positions in space and from which 3D data is to be acquired for analysis of any objects which may be in that scanned space.",
                        "A more specific example is a LiDAR scanner which uses a resonant-type scanner that employs a Lissajous scanning. Such a resonant-type scanner is typically characterized in an opto-mechanical system involving use of two distinct scanning axes to provide a well-known advantage: when actuated at resonant frequency, the motion amplitude of a resonant scanner is \u02dcQ times larger than that of a raster scanner, where Q is the quality factor of the resonant scanner. Also, the resonant scanner's speed is greatly improved (e.g., much higher than that of a raster scanner which acquires data in a prescribed sequential pattern that is limited by the speed of its slow axis).",
                        "Many real-world applications demand ever-increasing speeds of spatial sampling and accuracy in terms of ability to provide a realistic assessment of objects in selected fields of view."

The scan-pattern design, and in certain instances the signal also, has a balanced or an optimized set of attributes including a sampling density attribute. The balanced or preferably optimized attributes (e.g., optimized to a degree for a specific application) are used to scan a RoI in the FoV by sampling or traversing the RoI more times than other regions in the FoV.

The number of different frequency components may be from three to a threshold limit (such as five, six or seven) whereat processing different frequency components provides negligible improvement. In addition to a sampling density attribute, the set of attributes which are balanced and/or optimized, may include a scanning-range attribute, and other types of attributes such as resonant frequency ratio, adjustments on phase shift (even if slight), fill-factor (as discussed earlier) and sampling uniformity.",

For each patch (i,j), the closest sampling point (x[ni,j], y[ni,j]) to its center location (xi, yi) is obtained and the distance is calculated between these two points. The parameter i,j indicates the importance of each patch and is defined as the average weight in patch (i,j). Patches with larger average weights have a higher priority during optimization. Note that if the distance between patch (i,j) and (x[ni,j], y[ni,j]) is smaller than a threshold, this patch is considered as occupied and i,j is set to zero, regardless the weight value in this patch. From pattern, gradient descent optimization is performed on the parameter set {\u03b1n}, {\u03b2k}, {\u03b3n}, {\u03b4k}. Once the optimization is done, spatial sampling can be conducted on a 3D scene, and a sparse point cloud is generated.

In left part of FIG. 1B, optimization results of several adaptive Lissajous patterns focused onto specified regions-of-interest (RoI) are shown. The gray blocks in each sub-figure show the RoI. Numbers below each sampling pattern are the sampling density (amount of sampling points) in the RoI. The ratio of resonance frequencies between two scanning axes r=fxr/fyr are listed at the right of each row. Comparisons with unmodulated (non-adaptive) Lissajous patterns are shown in the right part of FIG. 1B. As indicated by the sampling density values, adaptive Lissajous patterns sample more points in the specified RoIs. In general situations, the sampling densities are boosted by \u02dc2\u00d7 or more.",
                        "FIG. 2A show qualitative comparison of baseline and design patterns relevant to object-detection estimations of use of these patterns. Object detection is a task that is of interest in 3D computer vision and in connection with certain example embodiments, and is considered an aspect of the present disclosure. For each scene encountered in the task, important objects (e.g., cars, pedestrians) might concentrate in specific regions in the FoV. Therefore, a denser sampling in these Regions-of-Interest (RoI) may be required while sampling outside the RoIs may be redundant, given a fixed total amount of sampling points.",
                        "In the example of FIG. 2A, the adaptive scanning pattern is shown in the upper row 310. Each bounding box depicted in FIG. 2A contains an object and the black numbers under each bounding box indicates number of sampling points contained in the bounding box. When compared to the baseline sampling pattern, as in the lower row 320, the optimized pattern samples significantly more points (\u02dc3\u00d7) in regions that contain important objects (e.g., cars in this scene). For example, for respective adaptive pattern associated with design pattern and non-adaptive pattern associated with design pattern: the bounding box that is to the right of center in each image (common to each and identified in FIG. 2 using an asterisk, *) indicates the number of sampling points being 316 for the adaptive pattern and 176 for the non-adaptive pattern, and the bounding box just to the right of center indicates the number of sampling points being 476 for the adaptive pattern and 157 for the non-adaptive pattern (and respectively labeled in FIG. 2 as \u201c476\u201d and \u201c157\u201d). This focused sampling largely facilitates the overall object detection process for many such applications of object detection such as in LiDAR applications.",
                        "Apart from the example of scanning pattern optimization in object detection, the mechanism of the proposed optimization framework is demonstrated with another computer vision task, depth inpainting, in FIG. 2B. Depth inpainting involves generating a dense depth map (3D reconstruction) from a sparsely sampled point cloud (and optionally, a reference RGB image). Consistent with this disclosure, a state-of-the-art depth inpainting framework is adapted for task-driven scanning pattern optimization.",
                        "FIG. 2B also shows examples of modulated waveforms for x(t) and y(t) with associated sampling or scanning patterns. For example, there are two examples of a depth of modulation (e.g., amount of amplitude modulation) between Scene1 and Scene2. The amount of modulation for x(t) and y(t) associated with Scene1 is greater than the amount of modulation for x(t) and y(t) associated with Scene2. The modulated waveforms shown in FIG. 2B includes at least amplitude modulation.",
                        "Certain known depth inpainting framework may consist of a rough bilateral filtering stage and a refinement stage. The model may also contain a monocular depth estimator to assist the inpainting task. The whole inpainting algorithm is accomplished by an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN), where the bilateral filter is also approximated by an CNN model. In contrast to using that approach, the original bilateral filter is used in the pipeline, and the error-map from this bilateral filter stage is directly used for optimization. This may be implemented to avoid the influence of depth information contained in monocular depth estimation. The advantage of the proposed optimization framework, comparatively, is that RoI information across the whole FoV has an impact on the scanning pattern updating, even when the non-optimized sampling region is small.",
                        "Another more-specific experimental-type embodiments of the present disclosure include LiDAR odometry task. LiDAR odometry algorithms estimate the pose and trajectory of an object during navigation. They extract feature points from a 3D point cloud or a 2D image acquired in each frame. By comparing the spatial positions of these feature points between successive frames, pose of the object in a world coordinate can be estimated. In one such example in this context, LiDAR odometry with resonant scanning patterns is considered on a simulated or real dataset, and a state-of-the-art LiDAR odometry framework, named \u201cLOAM\u201d, is adapted for use into the resonant (frequency) scanning scenario. For further information regarding these datasets and other known background aspects, reference may be made to the list of publications in Appendix A of the above U.S. Provisional Application (as examples: Ji Zhang et al., Loam: Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time.

Other specific aspects for this example embodiment of the present disclosure are shown in FIGS. 3B-3E. FIG. 3B shows phase-control estimations associated with use of this embodiment. FIG. 3C shows recorded baseline scanning pattern, without phase control, for two successive frames, for this embodiment. FIG. 3D shows recorded unmodulated sampling patterns, with control, for two successive frames. Finally, FIG. 3E shows recorded optimized patterns, for comparison, related to these embodiments.",
                        "This example embodiment uses a MEMS scanner with resonant frequencies fxr=2660 Hz, fyr=1100 Hz, with a resonant frequency ratio r=2.42. The quality factors for the two axes are QX\u02dc30 and Qy\u02dc50. Since the quality factor for the y-axis is too high, it is actuated with a single frequency, which results in sub-optimal performance of the system as compared to multi-frequency scanning in both axes. Further, a wide-band phase detection and control system are used to eliminate the inherent phase instability in MEMS scanners. With this system, \u02dc1\u00b0 phase control accuracy is achieved, as shown in FIG. 3B. To measure the accuracy, detection of the scanner phase is conducted at the beginning of each frame and it is compared to the required phase, within ten minutes of the scanner operation. This calibration may be conducted with a high-speed oscilloscope (not shown in FIG. 3A). The accuracy can be improved with faster MPU (or CPU), or through use of better position-detection hardware. See also further discussion on phase stability (with and without control) hereinbelow.",
                        "For phase control, exemplary efforts in connection with the present disclosure demonstrate such control for single frequency scanning. Such efforts may include recording the scanning patterns with a high-speed position sensor (PSD). For example, it may be assumed that each frame=6.4 ms. Scanning patterns with on-resonance actuation (fx=2660 Hz, fy=1100 Hz) and without phase control are shown in FIG. 3C, for two successive frames. Most portions of the FoV are either over-sampled or under-sampled. FIG. 3D shows another single-frequency scanning pattern with fx=2672 Hz, fy=1100 Hz, \u03d5x=\u03c0/14 and \u03d5y=0 and with the above-mentioned phase control scheme. This is a demonstration of the phase control scheme being effective and accurate.",
                        "Discussion now turns to phase control in multiple-frequency scanning, again involving such efforts in connection with the present disclosure. For one example of a multi-frequency scanning scenario or demonstration, the x-axis of the scanner may be driven at three frequencies, fx, 13/14fx, 15/14fx, and the y-axis may be driven at a single frequency fy. Phases of the three components in the x-axis scanning are monitored and controlled at the beginning of every four frames. Frame time is set to be the same as that in the single frequency scanning experiment. As shown in FIG. 3E, for fx=2200 Hz, fy=1100 Hz (r\u02dc2.0), The scanning pattern is focused on to gray color RoI, and sampling densities (black number above sampling pattern) in the RoI increases from 99 (left side, non-adaptive baseline pattern) to 131 (right side, adaptive optimized pattern).",
                        "Yet further aspects of efforts supporting the present disclosure concern methodology involving setting up and controlling the phases used in the modulation signals for appropriate use in the above-discussed scanning examples. First, examples of phase control setup are addressed. As shown in FIG. 3A, the MEMS scanner may be actuated with signal generators (e.g., SIGLENT SDG2000X) as controlled by external phase modulation signals. The motion of the MEMS may be detected with a high-speed position sensor (e.g., ON-TRAK OT-301). In one such effort consistent with the above discussion, this motion signal is fed into an analog wide-band (e.g., Hilbert transformer) phase detector board for 90 degrees phase shift. Both motion signals x(t), y(t) and the 90 degrees phase shifted signals x(t), y(t) are sampled with an MPU chip (PJRC Teensy3.6). In this example and in practice, such a phase detector may apply a frequency dependent phase shift on both output signals while the relative phase between these two outputs is fixed to be \u03c0/2. A fast processing algorithm is performed on the two signals to get the phase and a feed-back signal is generated to the external modulation port of signal generators.",
                        "As for phase estimation process, the related phase calculation may be less complex in the single frequency actuation case. For example, after collecting x(t) and z(t) at the beginning of each frame, a fast arctangent calculation (see Sreeraman Rajan, et al., Efficient approximations for the arctangent function, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 23(3):108-111, 2006) may be performed to obtain the phase.
