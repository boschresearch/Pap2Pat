                        "Paper-based microfluidic devices or microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (microPADs) were first reported in 2007 using lithographical protocols for patterning on a paper sheet (Martinez, A. W. et al., 2007, Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 46(8):1318-1320). The microPADs are fabricated by creating hydrophobic barriers on the paper sheet to create hydrophilic channels and test areas to guide the analytes of interest in a specific direction to the point of interest. As compared to conventional microfluidic devices, microPADs present many distinct advantages such as low-cost, smaller size and ability to function without supporting equipment such as pumps and power sources (Martinez, A. W. et al., 2008, Analytical Chemistry, 80(10):3699-3707). The miniaturization of multiple laboratory functions into paper-based chips integrated with faster response has opened up new opportunities in the field of low-cost portable point of care diagnostics (Oncescu, V. et al., 2013, Lab on a Chip, 13(16):3232-3238; Kumar, A. A. et al., 2015, Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 54(20):5836-5853; Gong, M. M. et al., 2017, Chemical Reviews, 117(12):8447-8480). MicroPADs have shown potential use for various fluidic applications such as food safety and processing (Choi, J. R., et al., 2019, Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), 19(4): 817; Chaiyo, S., et al., 2015, Analytica Chimica Acta, 866:75-83; Choi, J. R., et al., 2016, Lab on a Chip, 16(3):611-621; Liu, C. C. et al., 2018, Food Chemistry, 249:162-167; Zhang, Y. et al., 2015, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 68:14-19), environmental monitoring (Chen, Y. et al., 2016, Biosensors & bioelectronics, 81:317-323; Li, B. et al., 2017, ACS Sensors, 2(2):243-250; Wang, P. et al., 2017, Electrochemistry Communications, 81:74-78; Sicard, C. et al., 2015, Water Research, 70:360-369), cell biology (Wang, P. et al., 2017, Electrochemistry Communications, 81:74-78; Sicard, C. et al., 2015, Water Research, 70:360-369; Tao, F. F> et al., 2015, BioChip Journal, 9(2):97-204), drug screening (Hong, B. et al., 2016, Biomedical Microdevices, 18(1):21; Musile, G. et al., 2015, Analytical Methods, 7(19):8025-8033) and clinical diagnosis (Martinez, A. W. et al., 2010, Analytical Chemistry, 82(1):3-10; Piety, N. Z. et al., 2017, Scientific Reports, 7(1):45488; Hede, M. S. et al., 2018, Scientific Reports, 8(1):4122; Magro, L. et al., 2017, Scientific Reports, 7(1):1347).",
                        "Since their introduction, several techniques have been demonstrated to pattern the paper substrates for the fabrication of microPADs. These techniques are based on photolithography (Martinez, A. W. et al., 2007, Angewandte Chemie International Edition, 46(8):1318-1320; Martinez, A. W. et al., 2008, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 105(50):19606; Klasner, S. A. et al., 2010, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 397(5):1821-1829), ink jet printing (Abe, K. et al., 2008, Analytical Chemistry, 80(18): 6928-6934; Abe, K. et al., 2010, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 398(2):885-893), plasma treatment (Li, X. et al., 2008, Analytical Chemistry, 80(23):9131-9134), screen printing (Dungchai, W. et al, 2011, Analyst, 136(1):77-82), CVD (Lam, T. et al. 2017, Scientific Reports, 7(1):1188), wax printing (Carrilho, E. et al., 2009, Analytical Chemistry, 81(16):7091-7095; Lu, Y. et al., 2010, Analytical Chemistry, 82(1):329-335), laser treatment (Chitnis, G. et al., 2011, Lab on a Chip, 11(6):1161-1165), flexographic printing (Olkkonen, J. et al., 2010, Analytical Chemistry, 82(24):20246-20250; de Tarso Garcia, P. et al., 2014, RSC Advances, 4(71):37637-37644) and automated/handheld tools (Fenton, E. M. et al., 2009, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, 1(1):124-129; Wang, W. et al., 2010, Journal of Chromatography A, 1217(24):3896-3899; Bruzewicz, D.A. et al., 2008, Analytical Chemistry, 80(9):3387-3392; Ghaderinezhad, F. et al., 2017, Scientific Reports, 7(1):3553). Some of these techniques such as ink-jet printing and wax printing are very promising in terms of rapid prototyping, however they each have a set of associated challenges, making them unsuitable for the automated mass fabrication of microPADs (Yetisen, A. K. et al., 2013, Lab on a Chip, 13(12):2210-2251; Li, X. et al., 2012, Biomicrofluidics, 6(1):011301). While techniques such as photolithography, CVD, and plasma treatment produce highly reproducible microPADs with good precision (Akyazi, T. et al., 2018, Analytica Chimica Acta, 1001:1-17), these methods are not cost-effective and involve sophisticated procedures (Akyazi, T. et al., 2018, Analytica Chimica Acta, 1001:1-17; Cate, D. M. et al., 2015, Analytical Chemistry, 87(1):19-41).",

An affordable and simple two-step process\u2014Cut and Heat (CH-microPADs)\u2014is presented for the fabrication of hydrophilic channels and reservoirs selectively on a wide variety of porous media such as tissue/printing/filter paper and cloth types such as cotton and polyester, by a lamination process. The devices possess excellent mechanical strength against bending and folding, making them virtually unbreakable. They showed good chemical resistance to various solvents, acids, and bases, presenting a widespread applicability in the areas such as clinical diagnostics, biological, sensing applications, food processing, and chemical industry. The fabricated 96 well-plate CH-microPADs were tested for cell culture applications using mice embryonic fibroblasts and detection of proteins and enzymes using ELISA. The technique presents a promising step towards mass fabrication of inexpensive disposable diagnostic devices both for resource-limited and developed regions.",

These device shapes were then cut using the multipurpose commercial laser cutter Epilog Laser Fusion 120 watts, used primarily for cutting and engraving of plastic and wood laminates. Laser power was used at 3 percent, and speed was used at 10 percent. These numbers were obtained after couple of iterations on plastic and paper sheets. Stationary purpose lamination sheets were used to create the hydrophobic barriers on various type of cloth sheets such as cotton, polyester and silk and paper sheets such as tissue paper, printing paper and filter paper. A6, A5 and A4 size lamination layers were used to cut the devices. The design can be cut in one or both the lamination layers depending on need and application. Different size lamination layers (brand name MODEST from Modern Stationery LLC) were sourced from Amazon UAE. The lamination layers can be of any other brand as well. The thickness of lamination layers (2 layers) was 250 \u03bcm. The filter paper sheet, a P8 grade (Fisherbrand) filter paper for the current studies or the paper sheet of interest was then placed in between cut lamination sheets, FIG. 2, forming a sandwich structure. The sandwich structures were then heated on a laboratory hot plate (IKA C-MAG HS 7), at different temperatures for varying durations.",

Prior to staining, the cells were washed with prewarmed physiological saline. The cells in the CH-microPADs were stained with 100 uL of 2M Calcein AM and 4M Ethidium homodimer 1 working solution for 45 minutes at room temperature. After the incubation, the CH-microPADs were lifted from the wells and mounted on a clean slide followed by confocal imaging using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope. In this staining method, live cells are distinguished by the presence of ubiquitous intracellular esterase activity, determined by the enzymatic conversion of the virtually nonfluorescent cell-permeant Calcein AM to the intensely fluorescent Calcein. The polyanionic dye Calcein is well retained within live cells, producing an intense uniform green fluorescence in live cells. Ethidium homodimer 1 dye enters cells with damaged membranes and undergoes a 40-fold enhancement of fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids, thereby producing a bright red fluorescence in dead cells. The results of the assay is displayed in FIG. 11A.",

The mechanism of this assay is based on metabolically active cells reducing the tetrazolium salt of MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromidefor) to purple formazan (MTT cell proliferation kit, catalogue number 21465007001, Roche). The CH-microPADs with thickness of 120 \u03bcm and diameter of 6 mm were placed in each well of 96 well plate inside a biosafety cabinet. The scaffolds were sterilized under UV radiation for one hour each on both sides. MEFs at a concentration of 0.01\u00d7206 cells/well were plated on to the CH-microPADs placed in each well. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 for one hour. After the incubation, 100 uL of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1\u00d7 antibiotics (Sigma) were added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO2 for three time points, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. At each time points, 10 \u03bcl MTT labelling solution was added to each well followed by incubation for 4 hours. After 4 hours, 100 uL MTT solubilization reagent was added to each well and incubated overnight. Media without cells and with the CH-microPADs were used as blank. 2D monolayer MEF culture was used as a cell growth control. 100 \u03bcL aliquots from cultures wells were transferred to another 96-well plate for measuring Absorbance. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader (Epoch, BioTek). All steps in MTT assays were conducted in dark as MTT reagents are sensitive to light.

Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All reagents were used as received and sterile nuclease free water was used throughout the experiments. For detecting the dilution linearity of ELISA reaction, rabbit IgG concentrations ranging from 0.01 \u03bcg/mL-1000 \u03bcg/mL were used. Rabbit IgG concentration which showed the most linear reaction kinetics was used for the actual ELISA experiments. The concentration ranging from 1 \u03bcg/mL to 100 \u03bcg/mL was coated onto the each well of the CH-microPADs in serial dilution and incubated 12 hours at 4\u00b0 C. After incubation, the coated CH-microPAD wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for one hour at room temperature, then washed with PBS and added goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alkaline phosphatase conjugate in 1:200 dilution for one hour at room temperature. The enzymatic reactions were developed with the NBT-BCIP substrate for 15 minutes at room temperature (Soman, S. S. et al., 2009, Molecular Immunology, 46(10):2029-2038; Liu, S. et al., 2019, Chemical, 285:529-535). All fluid volumes used are 10 \u03bcL per well. For quantifying the color development, the CH-microPADs were analyzed in a BioTek microplate reader at Absorbance 570 nm. A graph was plotted based on mean color intensity after subtracting the blank well values. An iPhone camera was used to capture the images of colorimetric assays as viewed by the eyes. Ricoh scanner was used to scan the color developed on CH-microPADs at a resolution of 300 dpi after removing the liquid. The results of the immunoassay are showed in FIG. 12A through FIG. 12D. The experiments were carried out at least three times in triplicates and analyzed statistically.",

                                "The CH-microPADs fabrication is a simple two-step process. In the first step, the devices were cut in specific design in the lamination sheets and in the second step, heated on a hot plate with a sheet of paper in between two lamination sheets having cut channels. For the device fabrication, the devices were designed in the CAD software as per the need of the experiments in line, Y, circular array, flower shape and 96 well plate format and cut using a laser cutter in the lamination layers. The filter paper sheet was then placed in between cut lamination layers, (FIG. 2), forming a sandwich structure. The sandwich structures were then heated on a laboratory hot plate. When the heating was done, the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layer on the lamination sheets slowly melted and diffused in the paper sheet from the top and the bottom layer, shown schematically in (FIG. 7A through FIG. 7F. The diffused EVA created hydrophobic barriers and leaving cut areas as hydrophilic channels and sample/reaction spaces. Using the process described the letters (BPEL @NYUAD) were cut in the lamination sheets and used for patterning of hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas using a filter paper sheet. The patterned letters were used as hydrophilic regions to flow Rhodamine B (that gives the pinkish color) as an analyte (FIG. 6A). The hydrophobic boundaries were strong enough that the letters are sharp (FIG. 6A), without any visible leak or blot at the ends.",
                                "The device designs can be cut in large numbers in A2, A3, A4 or A5 lamination layers and then heated on a hot plate either one sheet at a time or in a stacked fashion. The individual microPADs then can be cut and used as needed from the mass fabricated array of CH-microPADs (FIG. 6C). The proposed technique was used for the fabrication of different device designs such as 96 well plate (FIG. 6B), circular array, line, Y, and flower shape (FIG. 6D). The line, Y and flower shape devices were shown for the mixing of red and green colors to generate yellow color. These device designs can be used for various sensing and quality control applications based on mixing of analytes or reaction of analytes with the cells seeded in the hydrophilic inlet reservoirs. In the current study, fabricated 96 well plates were used for cell culture applications and detection of proteins and enzymes using ELISA in the hydrophilic 3D porous paper matrix.",

                                "Stationary purpose lamination sheets were used to create the hydrophobic barriers on various type of cloth sheets such as cotton, polyester, silk and paper sheets such as tissue paper, printing paper and filter paper. The commercially available lamination sheets are inexpensive and readily available from local stationary or online stores. The lamination layers are made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) outer layer and EVA inner layer (Anni, M., 2012, Applied Physics Letters, 101(1):013303) (FIG. 7A through FIG. 7F). EVA is a block-copolymer made by combining ethylene and vinyl acetate. EVA melting temperatures vary between 90\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C. depending on the ratio of vinyl acetate and ethylene (Crawford, R. J. et al., 2002, William Andrew Publishing: Norwich, NY. p. 19-68). EVA copolymers are commonly used as hot-melt adhesives for various applications such as footwear, furniture, packaging, product assembly, bookbinding and heat-sealing applications (Lu, X. et al., 2017, RSC Advances, 7(58):36382-36391; Park, Y. J. et al., 2006, International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives, 26(8):571-576).",
                                "The microscope image of the cross-section of a lamination layer clearly highlighted the layered structure, PET and EVA, (FIG. 7D). A filter paper placed between two lamination sheets and heated for 20 seconds at 160\u00b0 C. is imaged (FIG. 7E). It can be observed that within 20 seconds the EVA layer started melting and diffusing in the paper sheet, which in turn made firm contact with the paper sheet. After heating for 20 seconds at 160\u00b0 C. the thickness of layered assembly was approximately 360 \u03bcm (FIG. 7E). As the filter paper sandwiched lamination sheets were heated for 35 minutes at 160\u00b0 C., the EVA layer diffused completely in the paper layer, changing the color from white to charcoal grey, matching with the color of EVA layer (FIG. 7F). It can be observed from FIG. 7F, the thickness of layered assembly reduced to 310 \u03bcm as compared to 360 \u03bcm in FIG. 7E. The reduction in the thickness was due to slow diffusion of EVA layer in the porous filter paper as it was continually heated at 160\u00b0 C.",

                                "Surface and cross-sectional topography of filter paper sheet and fabricated devices was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) before and after heating the devices. For the device fabrication, P8 grade filter paper (Fisherbrand) sheets were used, SEM image of the surface and cross-sectional view of the paper sheet is shown in FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B. The paper sheet is made of multiple layers of cellulose fibers and the thickness of the paper sheet was approximately 160 micrometers (\u03bcm), (FIG. 8B). The paper sheet was placed between two lamination sheets having a channel of width 700\u00b150 \u03bcm heated for 20 seconds at 160\u00b0 C. The short 20 s heating was to hold it properly for imaging purpose only so that the paper sheet made good contact with the lamination sheets and did not move while handling the device. The channel top view and cross-section after 20 s heating is shown in FIG. 8C and FIG. 8D. The device was then heated at 160\u00b0 Celsius for 35 minutes. With heating, the EVA diffused in the paper sheet in the vertical direction and also in the channel area laterally (FIG. 8E and FIG. 8F). On heating, the sandwiched area became hydrophobic because of the diffusion of melted EVA in the paper sheet and open paper areas remained hydrophilic for the flow of analytes.",

                                "The inner layer of the lamination sheets is made of EVA whereas outer layer is made of PET. These sandwiched structures were imaged under the microscope before and after heat treatment (FIG. 9A through FIG. 9I). A 700\u00b150 micrometers (\u03bcm) width channel was cut in the lamination sheets and a P8 grade (Fisherbrand) filter paper sheet was placed in between them (FIG. 9A). The cross-sectional view of the device is shown in FIG. 9B, FIG. 9D and FIG. 9F highlighting open paper region, which will be hydrophilic and sandwiched paper region between lamination sheets, which will become hydrophobic after heating the device structure (FIGS. 9D and 9F). The device structure was then heated on a hot plate for 35 minutes at 160\u00b0 Celsius. When heated at a temperature of 160\u00b0 Celsius, the EVA layer in contact with paper sheet, slowly melted and diffused in the paper sheet. After heating, the sandwiched areas were seen brighter under the microscope compared to before heating; this is because when EVA is diffused in the paper sheet, pores and blank area in between fibers were filled with EVA causing less light scattering and absorbing by paper sheet (FIG. 9C). The cross-sectional view of the device structure after heating highlights that the color of paper sheet turned to charcoal grey from white as EVA layer diffused in the paper sheet on heating (FIG. 9D). The sandwiched paper regions turns to hydrophobic region due to the diffused EVA and created sharp boundaries from open hydrophilic paper region for confinement of liquids. When the hydrophilic paper region in the device was introduced with 5 microliters of red food color, it showed clear boundary between color paper region to hydrophobic sandwiched region (FIG. 9E). The cross-sectional view of the device structure with food color is shown in FIG. 9F. The EVA layer, when melted, diffused isotropically in the paper sheet both in the vertical and lateral directions, forcing it into the hydrophilic paper channel, as shown with dashed yellow lines in FIG. 9A through FIG. 9F. The isotropic flow of EVA on heating reduced the effective channel width from 700\u00b150 \u03bcm (Wbh) to 600\u00b150 \u03bcm (Wah) (FIG. 9C and FIG. 9E respectively).",
                                "The present technique overcomes difficulties faced by wax patterning to create hydrophobic barriers. The main limitation of wax-based pattering was in achieving control on the flow of the melted wax while creating barriers into the porous paper media (Carrilho, E. et al. 2009, Analytical Chemistry, 81(16):7091-7095). Here, the present technique offers a simple two-step process having precise control to form hydrophobic barriers in which sandwiched regions became hydrophobic on heating whereas open areas were left hydrophilic. Another advantage is the very high thermal stability up to 100\u00b0 C. offered by these devices. This is because the EVA diffusion process only starts at temperatures more than 110\u00b0 C. and it takes more than 12 hours even at 110\u00b0 C. for the EVA to completely diffuse in the paper sheets. Therefore, the proposed CH-microPADS are ideally suited for high temperature analyte measurements as well.",
                                "The heating duration at a specific temperature is a very important parameter for uniform diffusion of EVA inside the paper sheets. The EVA needs to be diffused completely while heating through the paper sheet in order to make it completely hydrophobic. If the heating is uneven and for shorter duration, the EVA diffusion will not be uniform, leaving hydrophilic parts in the sandwiched area. Three devices were tested to study the effect of heating duration on liquid confinement; the devices were heated at 160\u00b0 C. for three different time durations. For the testing, 1 mm channel devices having a 2 mm diameter test area were fabricated. In each device, 5 microliters of food color were introduced to see its spread. The liquid confinement was different for all three devices as shown in the picture of the devices with the inset showing zoomed area shown under the microscope (FIG. 9G through FIG. 9I). Device 1 was heated for 20 minutes at 160\u00b0 C., it can be observed that the dye leaked and spread out of the channel, making effective width of the channel more than 1 mm (FIG. 9G). Device 2 was heated for 35 minutes at 160\u00b0 C., the food color remained confined within the channel width, the effective channel width was 1\u00b10.05 mm measured under the microscope FIG. 9H). The third device was heated for 60 minutes at 160\u00b0 C. With overheating, the EVA diffused deeper in the channel area resulting in a narrower channel, a reduced channel width from 1 mm to 0.750\u00b10.05 mm (FIG. 9I). Therefore, the heating at 160\u00b0 C. for a duration of 35 minutes was found optimal; it resulted in leak-proof channels with sharp boundaries between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas. For the same heating temperature, the duration may be reduced if the pressure is increased.",
                                "Lower the temperature, longer would be the heating duration for optimal EVA diffusion in the porous sheet and vise-versa. In order to optimize the heating temperature and duration, the sandwich structures were heated at various temperatures such as 110\u00b0 C., 120\u00b0 C., 140\u00b0 C., 160\u00b0 C., 180\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0 C. for different durations. It took 12 hours, 3 hours, 1 hour, 35 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes respectively to completely diffuse EVA through qualitative grade plain filter paper sheet-P8 grade (Fisherbrand). When different porous media such as cloth or other types of papers are used, the temperature vs time duration has to be optimized. The heating process showed an inverse relationship with heating duration (FIG. 9J). The process can be multiplexed by heating multiple device structures arranged in a stack.",

The channels were 10 mm in length with a 2 mm diameter reservoir at both ends (FIG. 10A). The sandwiched structures were heated at 160\u00b0 C. for 35 minutes on a hot plate. In each device, 5 microliters of food color was introduced. All the devices showed flow of food color from one end to the other end, except for the 0.2 mm device. The channel widths were measured under the microscope (FIG. 10B) shown as inset in (FIG. 10A). A minimum channel width of 0.3\u00b10.05 mm was obtained for the CH-microPADs with repeated devices (n=10).",

The EVA formed barriers were stable against most of the chemicals such as acetic acid, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and glycerol. The chemicals were mixed with red food color dissolved in water and introduced in the channel reservoir shown in FIG. 10C. The concentration of HCl and NaOH was 1M and the other chemicals were undiluted except glycerol (diluted at a ratio of 1:5 with deionized water). The acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (THF) showed some leakage at the introduction reservoir (FIG. 10D). It was interesting to note that the barriers were resistant to most of the chemicals used including strong acids and bases.

They enable fluid transport via capillary action without the need of external pumps and power supply as compared to microfluidic devices made with glass, silicon and/or polymers because of their hydrophilic and porous nature. Many techniques have been demonstrated for the patterning of paper sheets based on ink jet printing (Abe, K. et al., 2008, Analytical Chemistry, 80(18):6928-6934; Abe, K. et al., 2010, Bioanalytical Chemistry, 398(2):885-893), screen-printing (Dungchai, W. et al, 2011, Analyst, 136(1):77-82), photolithography (Martinez, A.

A. et al., 2008, Analytical Chemistry, 80(9):3387-3392; Ghaderinezhad, F. et al., 2017, Scientific Reports, 7(1):3553). Even after 14 years since their first introduction in 2007, the successful commercialization and scale-up of microPADs is far from reality. That is primarily because of challenges associated with many of these techniques for the automated mass fabrication of microPADs. Wax printing is commonly used for the patterning of channel barriers on a paper sheet, however wax printers are not commonly available. Patterning with wax also poses challenges related to flow control and leakage problem with surfactant mixed biological samples (Li, X. et al., 2012, Biomicrofluidics, 6(1):11301-1130113). While techniques such as CVD, photolithography and plasma treatment provide good reproducibility and precision, they involve complex processing steps to be carried in specific laboratory conditions which in turn increase the cost of the microPAD devices (Ghosh, R. et al., 2019, Scientific Reports, 9(1):7896). The microPADs fabricated by the techniques mentioned above also lack good mechanical robustness as compared to conventional microfluidic devices made from polymers, glass and/or silicon (Yang, Y. et al., 2017, Analytical Chemistry, 89(1):71-91). A promising technique for practical applications in both resource-limited settings and developed places should be suitable for mass fabrication with minimal fabrication steps, low cost, good mechanical strength and high precision and reproducibility.",

It is a simple two-step process for the fabrication of hydrophilic channels and reservoirs selectively on a porous sheet. The process can be used to create hydrophobic barriers on a wide variety of porous media such as tissue paper, printing paper, filter paper and a wide variety of cloth types such as cotton, silk and polyester. MicroPADs were fabricated only by using lamination layers and filter paper or a porous media of interest as consumable material. The fabrication process can be used to create any device designs or fluidic patterns on the porous sheets. This makes the process robust and repeatable every time, unlike many other techniques used to fabricate microPADs where repeatability is a major concern. The fabrication steps involve minimal human intervention, making the process ideal for automation, which is a key feature, aimed at mass fabrication of CH-microPADs. The fabrication process was characterized and demonstrated by creating different device designs on various types of paper and cloth sheets. The presented technique circumvents the use of clean room facilities and harsh chemicals making it easily accessible for point of use fabrication of microPADs. The fabricated devices are highly robust, thermally and chemically stable for a wide range of solvents, strong acids and bases. Moreover, the devices possess very high mechanical strength against bending, folding and tearing. The fabricated devices were virtually unbreakable as the devices are fabricated through lamination process commonly used for the protection of paper sheets.",

The cellulose material used to make the CH-microPADs are biocompatible, nontoxic and environment friendly.",

The protein adsorption capacity of the fabricated CH-microPADs appeared consistent in the ELISA experiments. The reagents required to do the assay is 5-10 \u03bcL in each step, which saves the amount of costly immuno-detection reagents compared to the traditional 96 well plate plastics. This observation expands its scope to be used as an immunodiagnostic device. The current paper based immuno-detection devices are mostly limited to test strip-based applications. But, amidst global pandemic crisis such as Covid-19, it is essential to develop efficient and cheaper mass diagnostic devices. The 96 or 384 well format CH-microPAD devices would be useful to bring in huge improvements in the immunoassay throughputs at mass point-of-care testing units. The proposed CH-microPAD devices are cheaper to produce, can be stored in less space at room temperature, can reduce the use of expensive immune reagents and polluting plastic materials per immunoassay.",

The process is scalable and involves minimal human intervention making it ideal for automation, where multiple devices can be fabricated in parallel on any size of porous sheets for cut and use point of care applications. The simplicity and versatility of the fabrication process demonstrated leads to its widespread adoption both in resource-limited and developed settings."

                                "Described below is the development of a portable, three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic paper-based analytical device (3D-\u03bcPAD) for performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to detect severe acute respiratory symptom coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in a sample. For testing, the device requires only the addition of a small fluid volumes, 10 \u03bcL per test well. In this embodiment, the 96 circular-well format paper device was prepared with lamination for easy sample handling and coated with a recombinant human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein. A colorimetric detection method was employed, using Alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated detecting antibody in the presence of the NBT/BCIP substrate. The colorimetric assays were evaluated using a microplate reader and quantified for linearity, limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, repeatability and specificity. Found was that the LOD of the assay was 0.01 ng/mL and the R2 value was 0.943 between experiments. The proof-of-concept assay has the potential to develop for clinical screening of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a high throughput immunodetection tool to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infections in a population who miss the active infection testing window.",
                                "The causative agent for the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutated to several variants causing different types of diseases all over the world ranging from mild to severe. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires a timely and accurate testing method. Currently, the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the viral particles in nasopharyngeal swabs. RT-PCR is one of the most accurate and sensitive methods and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But this test may require an active state of viral infection for diagnosis. If a patient was infected and misses the active testing window, which falls mostly within 1-10 days of infection, there may be a need to recourse the diagnosis to antibody testing.",
                                "Among different types of antibody testing methods, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an indispensable analytical tool that is routinely used in the laboratories for the detection and quantification of pathogen proteins in complex biological samples. ELISA is a multistep diagnostic procedure, where each component should be individually tested for the standardization of the assay. Therefore, optimization of each reaction step may be critical in devising a successful ELISA test. The primary component of an ELISA is the solid matrix required for the adhesion of the reagents. It is very important to choose a suitable surface for coating the antigens for ELISA experiments. Most ELISA tests consist of applying a protein solution in PBS buffer or carbonate buffer into microtiter plate wells. Normally, these microtiter plates are 96 well plates with polypropylene or charged polystyrene or surface possessing high affinity to molecules with polar or hydrophilic groups (Welch N G, Lebot C J, Easton C D, Scoble J A, Pigram P J, Muir B W. Polypropylene microtitre plates modified with [Cr(OH)6]3\u2212 for enhanced ELISA sensitivity. J Immunol Methods. 2017 July; 446:70-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2017.03.015. Epub 2017 Mar 30. PMID: 28365327; Boudet F, Th\u00e8ze J, Zouali M. UV-treated polystyrene microtitre plates for use in an ELISA to measure antibodies against synthetic peptides. J Immunol Methods. 1991 Aug. 28; 142(1):73-82. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(91)90294-p. PMID: 1717595). These surfaces have high binding capacity for proteins and antibodies and ensures proper antibody orientation. For ELISA using non-protein antigens such as lipid antigens dissolved in organic solvents like ethanol, a hydrophobic surface may be needed (Ketelsen A, Eriksson H. Sensitive detection of hydrophobic antigens using a novel lipid-aggregate based ELISA. J Immunol Methods. 2008 Dec. 31; 339(2):195-204. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2008.09.012. Epub 2008 Oct. 12. PMID: 18854191). The microwell plates give enough space to allow to cover the bottom of the well with the antigen solution. If the whole surface of the well is not covered uniformly with the fluids, the ELISA reading will be diminished. Also, if excess antibody or antigen is present, layers of antibody or antigen may form and again leads to lower signal. So uniform layering of reagents is a prerequisite for a reliable ELISA reaction. If the quantity of the reagents is reduced in micro quatities, it would be an added advantage to make the assay economical. Also, a massive scale pandemic such as COVID-19 affecting millions of people at the same time, requires a relatively rapid, robust, sensitive, and easy to interpret assay at the point-of-care units.",

The fluid in the wells were removed and the absorbance of the colorimetric reactions were measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader after 60 minutes of the enzymatic reaction. The reaction kinetics were checked after 20 minutes also. To see the color development using naked eye and record, the device was scanned using a regular paper scanner, such as a Ricoh scanner. Limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, repeatability and specificity of the assay were determined. A minimum of 3 experiments in triplicates were used to analyze the results statistically.",
                                "The current research work explores COVID-19 detection in the ELISA format using paper based 96 well plates fabricated using lamination sheets and filter paper sheets. The hydrophobic barriers around the wells in the well plate are formed by ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), the hot melt adhesive, coated inside of the lamination sheets. The lamination sheets are made of two layers, inner side made of EVA and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) on the outer side. During the process of lamination, the EVA melts when it passes through the hot rollers in the laminator and fastens tightly to the paper sheets when it comes to room temperature. The current fabrication process overcomes many limitations of the commonly used techniques such as wax patterning, lithography and inkjet printing. It is a simple two-step process, cutting of circular holes in the lamination sheets in the form of a 96 well plate and heating them with a paper sheet in between them on a laboratory use hot plate, thus named as \u201ccut and heat microPADs well plate\u201d (CH-microPADs well plate). The fabricated well plates as described here are highly robust and possess very high mechanical strength against folding, bending, tearing and twisting, making them virtually unbreakable. The fabrication process involves minimal human intervention, making it ideally suitable for mass fabrication of microPADs well plates.",
                                "The paper 96 well plates were then cut using a multipurpose commercial laser cutter, such as the Epilog Laser Fusion 120 watts. The laser cutter is used primarily for cutting and engraving of plastic and wood laminates. Stationery purpose lamination sheets were used to create the hydrophilic circular patterns selectively as wells and hydrophobic barriers in the areas except the wells on filter paper sheets. A6, A5 and A4 size lamination pouches were used to cut the devices. Different size lamination pouches were sourced from Amazon. The lamination pouches can be of any brand available from online or local stationary stores. The thickness of lamination pouch used (brand name, Modest, 2 layers) was 250 \u03bcm. The filter paper sheet of interest was then placed in between cut lamination sheets, FIG. 14A, making a sandwich structure. The sandwich structures were then heated on a laboratory hot plate (IKA C-MAG HS 7) at 160 degrees of temperature for a duration of 30 minutes. The resulting devices were then laminated from the backside using another lamination single sheet to have covered wells same as in the conventional well plates as shown in FIG. 14B.",

The paper sheet was placed between two lamination sheets having circular holes in the shape of a 96 well plate and heated the sandwich assembly for 20 seconds at 160\u00b0 C. The short 20 s heating was to hold it properly for imaging purpose only so that the paper sheet made good contact with the lamination sheets and did not move while handling the device. The well top view and cross-section after 20 s heating is shown in FIG. 15E and FIG. 15H. The device was then heated at 160\u00b0 Celsius for 35 minutes. With heating, the EVA diffused in the paper sheet in the vertical direction and also in the hole area laterally (FIG. 15F and FIG. 15I). On heating, the sandwiched area became hydrophobic because of the diffusion of melted EVA in the paper sheet and open paper areas remained hydrophilic for the flow of analytes.",
                                "The typical detection range for an ELISA is 0 0.01 ng to 0.1 ng of the analyte. The sensitivity of ELISA is largely dependent upon the particular characteristics of the antibody-antigen interaction (Zhang S, Garcia-D'Angeli A, Brennan J P, Huo Q. Predicting detection limits of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and bioanalytical techniques in general. Analyst. 2014 Jan. 21; 139(2):439-45. doi: 10.1039/c3an01835k. PMID: 24308031). In experiments, for detecting the sensitivity, serial dilutions of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein primary antibody was prepared and the lowest concentration of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein primary antibody detected in the colorimetric reaction, comparing to the negative control and the higher dilutions was determined as the sensitivity of the assay and plotted in the graph in FIG. 16A. The ELISA was sensitive to detect up to 0.01 ng/\u03bcL of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein primary antibody in a sample. The sensitivity of the ELISA can be increased by using polyclonal antibodies instead of monoclonal antibodies, due to higher levels of polyclonal antibody binding to the target antigen. Considering this, SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein rabbit polyclonal primary antibody was chosen for developing the assay. Along with the increased sensitivity, this will help to reduce the cost of the assay.",
                                "Furthermore, LOD of the assay was calculated from the linear curve generated in the colorimetric reaction, where the lowest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein primary antibody could be quantified reliably at least in 3 independent experiments in triplicates. This is the mean value of the smallest result measured in the linear part of the curve. The assay shows an LOD of 0.01 ng/\u03bcL as shown in FIG. 16B. An increase was noticed in colorimetric signal from higher concentrations and also in very low concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 primary antibody. The consistent linear part of the reaction curve was considered to calculate the LOD. The increase in color signal beyond the linear part of the graph indicates the non-specific color development. Linearity of dilution experiments provide information about the precision of the assay. For quantitation of antibody in a biological sample, it is necessary to create a standard curve of the testing antibody in serial dilutions. Used herein was PBS as diluent for diluting all reagents and it gave a reliable linear curve for analyzing the linearity and spike recovery of the ELISA. Five linear dilutions ranging from 0.01 ng/\u03bcL to 100 ng/\u03bcL of SARS-CoV-2 primary antibody showed linearity and spike recovery was observed at 0.001 ng/\u03bcL as shown in FIG. 16B. Spike recovery is calculated to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 primary antibody detection is influenced by diluent used or the surface of the paper wells. In these experiments, the spike recovery was consistent at 0.001 ng/\u03bcL SARS-CoV-2 primary antibody, indicating the accuracy of detection, as shown in FIG. 16C. Further, the repeatability of the assay is validated between experiments. Repeatability is a precision parameter to validate the reproducibility of the assay. Precision describes the deviation from the mean value. The assay showed a good repeatability with an R2 value 0.9428 between 3 independent experiments, as shown in FIG. 16D.",
                                "Specificity of ELISA means the reaction should differentiate the target antibody from the other matrix components. Used herein is a goat serum spiked with and without Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein primary antibody as a mock serum to test the specificity. Images of the colorimetric assay obtained for the well without AP in the detecting step (negative control), the well without the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigen (no-target control), the sample without the SARS-CoV-2 primary antibody and the sample with the SARS-CoV-2 primary antibody (positive control) (10 ng/\u03bcL). The graphs in FIG. 17A-FIG. 17C shows the absorbance at 405 nm observed after 1 hour of the reaction in various conditions. The assay showed highly specific color development based on the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein primary antibody concentration.",
                                "Developed herein is a proof-of-concept inexpensive colorimetric paper-based assay to detect SARS CoV2 antibodies in biological samples. The colorimetric readout facilitates naked eye observation and quantification of data using a regular microplate reader. With this proof-of-concept assay, the obtained experimental data suggest that this assay can detect the SARS-CoV-2 antibody at 0.01 ng/\u03bcL with an R2 value of 0.94. The assay can be performed within in 4 hours with a minimum laboratory equipment such as microplate reader as the 96 well format offer a robust throughput in mass screening. Also, the assay can be interpreted with naked eye in comparison to the negative and positive controls. This assay can detect the SARS-CoV-2 antibody in different types of biological samples, demonstrating its potential to be an alternative way to perform serological testing in testing centers. The antigen coated devices require less storage space and can be stored in normal refrigerator until the assay is conducted. The cost of assembling the assay is lower compared to the regular ELISA as this assay requires only micro volumes. This assay has the potential to be developed into a point-of-care diagnostic device and can achieve sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility comparable to other colorimetric serological assays. This ELISA devices could also contribute to the evaluation of vaccination efficacy in a large number of human trial samples due to its rapid, inexpensive and user-friendly platform.",
