                "Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (microPADs) were first reported in 2007 using lithographical protocols for patterning on a paper sheet. 1 MicroPADs are fabricated by creating hydrophobic barriers on the paper sheet to create hydrophilic channels and test areas to guide the analytes of interest in a specific direction to the point of interest. As compared to conventional microfluidic devices, microPADs present many distinct advantages such as low-cost, smaller size, and ability to function without supporting equipment such as pumps and power sources due to the intrinsic capillary action of porous paper. 2 The miniaturization of multiple laboratory functions into paper-based chips integrated with faster responses has opened up new opportunities in the field of low-cost portable point of care diagnostics. [3][4][5] MicroPADs have shown potential use for various fluidic applications such as food safety and processing, [6][7][8][9][10][11] environmental monitoring, [11][12][13][14][15] cell biology, 14,16 drug screening 17,18 and clinical diagnosis. 11,[19][20][21][22] Several techniques have been demonstrated in the literature to pattern paper substrates for the fabrication of microPADs. Fundamentally, the shapes of microfluidic pathways, such as channels and reservoirs, can be created in paper sheets either by (i) the physical blocking of pores in the areas of the sheet external to the desired shape via patterning using a hydrophobic medium such as photoresist, ink, wax, PDMS, or other materials, or by (ii) cutting the paper sheet in the desired pattern using a craft cutter or laser cutter to create a stand-alone paper device in the desired shape.",
                "Techniques for blocking of pores external to the patterned device, corresponding to (i) above, include photolithography, 1,23,24 ink jet printing, 25,26 plasma treatment, 27 screen printing, 28 chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 29 wax printing, 30,31 laser treatment, 32 and flexographic printing. 33,34 Of these, the most commonly used fabrication method is wax printing/dipping because of the low cost patterning material and promising potential in terms of rapid prototyping. However wax printing techniques have a set of challenges associated with them such as inconsistent patterning/reproducibility, issues with long term storage without climate control and instability at high temperatures, making them unsuitable for automated mass fabrication and storage. [35][36][37][38] Inkjet printers and laser toner printers provide another alternative for high throughput printing of hydrophobic barriers on paper substrates. 37,39,40 However, microPADs fabricated by using printers need an additional step of high temperature melting of toner ink to be impregnated into the paper matrix which may cause pyrolysis of cellulose and uses volatile organic solvents. 37,41 Flexographic printing is fast and well established for the fabrication of microPADs, but printing plates are expensive and changing plates for the printing of different designs is time consuming. 37,38 While techniques such as photolithography, CVD, and plasma treatment produce highly reproducible microPADs with good precision, 38,42,43 these methods are not cost-effective since they involve sophisticated equipment and procedures. 38,42,44 Techniques to cut paper sheets into stand-alone devices, corresponding to (ii) described above, include using handheld and automated tools such as craft cutters or scissors, and computer controlled knives and lasers. [45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52] Some researchers have used cover tape/lamination tape to enclose open channels and hold individually cut devices to provide support and improve handling and functionality. [49][50][51][52][53] One of the ways that this is accomplished is by creating a hollowed mold of the same shape as the device in a lamination sheet or in Parafilm infused hardened paper, and inserting the paper device in the matched hollow receptacle. 50 Another is to use pieces of cover tape that have holes for ports for fluid access to the paper device. 51 Another technique places the individual devices under an opening of the same shape in a lamination sheet, but the opening is of slightly smaller dimensions which allows the edges of the paper device to be held by the periphery of the opening cut in the lamination sheet. 52 These techniques are labor intensive, require manual precision, and cannot be easily automated.",
                "In the current study, a low-cost, simple and robust process is developed for the fabrication of microPADs using lamination sheets for the barrier formation making use of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), a hot melt adhesive, coated inside of the lamination sheets. Previously also, lamination sheets have been used for microPAD fabrication as holders or support for individually cut paper devices or for encapsulation, but not for device fabrication or being an integral part of the hydrophobic barriers. 49,50,[53][54][55] The current fabrication process presents many key distinct advantages as compared to commonly used fabrication techniques discussed above. It is a two-step process, involving cutting of microfluidic patterns in the lamination sheets and heating them with a paper sheet in between them for the fabrication of microPADs, which thus are named as \"cut and heat microPADs\" (CH-microPADs). The fabricated devices as described here are highly robust against many chemicals such as strong acids, bases and solvents and possess very high mechanical strength against bending, folding, twisting and tearing, making them virtually unbreakable. The fabrication process involves minimal human intervention, making it ideally suitable for mass fabrication of microPADs in a large array for cut and use applications."

The commercially available lamination sheets are inexpensive and readily available from stationery stores. The lamination pouches are made of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) outer layer and EVA inner layer. 56,57 Previously, researchers have used lamination sheets for covering open channels to minimize the evaporation of analytes and for providing mechanical support to the physically cut microPADs using a craft cutter and laser cutter. 51,58 EVA is a block-copolymer made by combining ethylene and vinyl acetate. EVA melting temperatures vary between 90 \u00b0C and 120 \u00b0C depending on the ratio of vinyl acetate and ethylene. 59 EVA copolymers are commonly used as hot-melt adhesives for various applications such as footwear, furniture, packaging, product assembly, bookbinding and heat sealing applications. 60,61 A filter paper sheet, P8 grade (Fisherbrand) filter paper for the current studies or the paper sheet of interest, was then placed in between cut lamination sheets forming a sandwich structure (Fig. 1)."

The shapes were cut in the lamination sheets using a commercial laser cutter. The paper sheet was then placed in between cut lamination pouches (Fig. 1), forming a sandwich structure. The sandwich structures were then heated on a laboratory hot plate. When heated, the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) layer on the lamination sheets slowly melted and diffused in the paper sheet from the top and bottom layers, shown schematically in Fig. 1a. The diffused EVA creates hydrophobic barriers and leaves cut areas as hydrophilic channels and sample/reaction spaces. In the uncut regions, melted EVA provides strong bonding of the lamination sheets to the paper. Using the process described, the letters 'BPEL @ NYUAD' were cut in the lamination sheets and used for patterning of hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas using a filter paper sheet. The patterned letters were used as hydrophilic regions to flow rhodamine B (which gives a pinkish color) as an analyte (Fig. 1b). The hydrophobic boundaries were strong and sharp (Fig. 1b), without any visible leak or blot at the ends.",

It can be observed from Fig. 2f that the thickness of the layered assembly was reduced to 310 \u03bcm as compared to 360 \u03bcm in Fig. 2d.

                                "Devices with the same specifications as those in Fig. 3 were also imaged under a microscope before and after heat treatment (Fig. 4). A 700 \u00b1 50 micrometer (\u03bcm) width channel was cut in the lamination sheets and a filter paper sheet was placed in between them (Fig. 4a(i)). The top and cross-sectional view of the device before heating are shown in Fig. 4a(i) and (ii), respectively, highlighting the open paper region, which will be hydrophilic, and the sandwiched paper region between lamination sheets, which will become hydrophobic after heating the device structure. The device structure was then heated on a hot plate for 35 minutes at 160 \u00b0C. When heated at a temperature of 160 \u00b0C, the EVA layer, in contact with the paper sheet, slowly melted and diffused in the paper sheet. After heating, the sandwiched areas were seen brighter under the microscope compared to those before heating; this is because when EVA is diffused in the paper sheet, pores and blank areas in between fibers were filled with EVA, causing less light scattering and absorbing by the paper sheet (Fig. 4a(iii)). The cross-sectional view of the device structure after heating highlights that the color of paper sheet turned to charcoal grey from white as the EVA layer diffused in the paper sheet on heating (Fig. 4a(iv)). The sandwiched paper region turned to a hydrophobic region due to the diffused EVA and created sharp boundaries from the open hydrophilic paper region for confinement of liquids. When the hydrophilic paper region in the device was introduced with 5 microliters of rhodamine B, it showed a clear boundary between the colored paper region and hydrophobic sandwiched region (Fig. 4a(v)). The cross-sectional view of the device structure with rhodamine B is shown in Fig. 4a(vi). The EVA layer, when melted, diffused isotropically in the paper sheet both in the vertical and lateral directions, forcing it into the hydrophilic paper channel, as shown with dashed yellow lines in Fig. 4a EVA on heating reduced the effective channel width from 700 \u00b1 50 \u03bcm (w bh ) to 600 \u00b1 50 \u03bcm (w ah ) (Fig. 4a(iii) and (v) respectively). The present technique overcomes difficulties faced by wax patterning to create hydrophobic barriers. The main limitation of wax based patterning is in achieving control of the flow of the melted wax while creating barriers in porous paper media. 30 Here, the present technique offers a simple two-step process having precise control to form hydrophobic barriers in which sandwiched regions became hydrophobic on heating whereas open areas were left hydrophilic. Another advantage is the very high thermal stability up to 100 \u00b0C offered by these devices. This is because the EVA diffusion process only starts at temperatures higher than 110 \u00b0C and it takes more than 12 hours even at 110 \u00b0C for the EVA to completely diffuse in the paper sheets. Therefore, the proposed CH-microPADs are ideally suited for high temperature analyte measurements as well.",
                                "The heating duration at a specific temperature is a very important parameter for uniform diffusion of EVA inside the paper sheets. The EVA needs to be diffused completely while heating through the paper sheet in order to make it completely hydrophobic. If the heating is uneven and has a shorter duration, the EVA diffusion will not be uniform, leaving hydrophilic parts in the sandwiched area. Three devices were tested to study the effect of heating duration on liquid confinement; the devices were heated at 160 \u00b0C for three different time durations. For the testing, 1 mm channel devices having a 2 mm diameter test area were fabricated. In each device, 5 microliters of rhodamine B was introduced to see its spread. The liquid confinement was different for all three devices as shown in the images of the devices with the insets showing zoomed in images of the areas highlighted under the microscope (Fig. 4b). Device 1 was heated for 20 minutes at 160 \u00b0C, and it can be observed that the dye leaked and spread out of the channel, making the effective width of the channel more than 1 mm (Fig. 4b(i)). Device 2 was heated for 35 minutes at 160 \u00b0C. Rhodamine B remained confined within the channel width, and the effective channel width was 1 \u00b1 0.05 mm measured under the microscope (Fig. 4b(ii)). The third device was heated for 60 minutes at 160 \u00b0C. With overheating, the EVA diffused deeper in the channel area resulting in a narrower channel, reducing the channel width from 1 mm to 0.750 \u00b1 0.05 mm (Fig. 4b(iii)). Therefore, the heating at 160 \u00b0C for a duration of 35 minutes was found to be optimal; it resulted in leak-proof channels with sharp boundaries between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas.",
                                "The lower the temperature, the longer the heating duration should be for optimal EVA diffusion in the porous sheet and vice versa. In order to optimize the heating temperature and duration, the sandwich structures were heated at various temperatures such as 110 \u00b0C, 120 \u00b0C, 140 \u00b0C, 160 \u00b0C, 180 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C for different durations. It took 12 hours, 3 hours, 1 hour, 35 minutes, 15 minutes, and 5 minutes respectively to completely diffuse EVA through qualitative grade plain filter paper sheets -P8 grade (Fisherbrand). When different porous media such as cloth or other types of paper are used, the temperature vs. time duration has to be optimized. The heating process showed an inverse relationship with the heating duration (Fig. 4c). The process can be multiplexed by heating multiple device structures arranged in a stack."

The channels were 10 mm in length with a 2 mm diameter reservoir at both ends (Fig. 5a). The sandwiched structures were heated at 160 \u00b0C for 35 minutes on a hot plate. In each device, 5 microliters of rhodamine B was introduced. All the devices showed the flow of rhodamine B from one end to the other end, except for the 0.2 mm device. The channel widths were measured under the microscope (Fig. 5b) and are shown as insets in Fig. 5a. A minimum channel width of 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 mm was obtained for the CH-microPADs with repeated device measurements (n = 10).",
                                "In order to evaluate the chemical stability, the CH-microPADs were exposed to several chemicals such as acids, bases and solvents. For the testing, 1 mm wide and 10 mm long channels with a 3 mm diameter reservoir at both ends were fabricated (Fig. 5c). The EVA formed barriers were stable against most of the chemicals such as acetic acid, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and glycerol. The chemicals were mixed with rhodamine B dissolved in water and introduced into the channel reservoir as shown in Fig. 5c. The concentration of HCl and NaOH was 1 M and the other chemicals were undiluted except glycerol (diluted at a ratio of 1 : 5 with deionized water). Acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (THF) showed some leakage at the introduction reservoir (Fig. 5d). It is significant to note that the barriers were resistant to most of the chemicals used including strong acids and bases. The CH-microPADs showed good chemical resistance to various solvents, acids and bases, showing the strong compatibility of the devices for a variety of solvents and analytes."

Prior to staining, the cells were washed with prewarmed physiological saline. The cells in the CH-microPADs were stained with 100 \u03bcL of 2 M calcein AM and 4 M ethidium homodimer 1 working solution for 45 minutes at room temperature. After the incubation, the CH-microPADs were lifted from the wells and mounted on a clean slide followed by confocal imaging using a Leica SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope. In this staining method, live cells are distinguished by the presence of ubiquitous intracellular esterase activity, determined by the enzymatic conversion of the virtually nonfluorescent cell-permeant calcein AM to the intensely fluorescent calcein. The polyanionic dye calcein is well retained within live cells, producing an intense uniform green fluorescence in live cells. The ethidium homodimer 1 dye enters cells with damaged membranes and undergoes a 40-fold enhancement of fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids, thereby producing a bright red fluorescence in dead cells. The results of the assay are displayed in Fig. 6a."

The mechanism of this assay is based on metabolically active cells reducing the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to purple formazan (MTT cell proliferation kit, catalogue number 11465007001, Roche). The CH-microPADs with a thickness of 120 \u03bcm and diameter of 6 mm were placed in each well of a 96 well plate inside a biosafety cabinet. The scaffolds were sterilized under UV radiation for one hour each on both sides. MEFs at a concentration of 0.01 \u00d7 10 6 cells per well were plated onto the CH-microPADs placed in each well.

After 4 hours, 100 \u03bcL MTT solubilization reagent was added to each well and incubated overnight. Media without cells and with the CH-microPADs were used as blank. A 2D monolayer MEF culture was used as cell growth control. 100 \u03bcL aliquots from culture wells were transferred to another 96-well plate for measuring absorbance. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm using a microplate reader (Epoch, BioTek). All steps in the MTT assays were conducted in the dark as the MTT assay reagents are sensitive to light.

The enzymatic reaction of the antibody conjugated alkaline phosphatase was developed with the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) substrate. The enzymatic reaction observed was directly proportional to the concentration of rabbit IgG coated onto the wells. The wells coated with 100 \u03bcg mL -1 rabbit IgG showed maximum color development while the lower concentration IgG coated wells showed a less intense color in a serial manner.

                "MicroPADs are lightweight, disposable, low-cost point of care devices with simple fabrication and ease of operation. They enable fluid transport via capillary action due to the hydrophilic and porous nature of paper, without the need of external pumps and a power supply, as compared to microfluidic devices made with glass, silicon, and/or polymers. Many techniques have been demonstrated for the patterning of paper sheets based on ink jet printing, 25,26 screen-printing, 28 photolithography, 1,23,24 plasma treatment, 27 CVD, 29 wax printing, 30,31 flexographic printing, 33 laser treatment 32 and techniques based on automated/ handheld tools. 34,[45][46][47][48] Even after a decade and a half since their first introduction in 2007, the successful commercialization and scale-up of microPADs has remained a challenge. This is primarily because of challenges associated with many of these techniques for the automated mass fabrication of microPADs. Wax printing is commonly used for the patterning of channel barriers on a paper sheet; however wax printers are not commonly available. Patterning with wax also poses challenges related to flow control and leakage problems with surfactant mixed biological samples. 36 While techniques such as CVD, photolithography and plasma treatment provide good reproducibility and precision, they involve complex processing steps to be carried out under specific laboratory conditions which in turn increases the cost of the microPADs. 64 The microPADs fabricated by the techniques mentioned above also lack good mechanical robustness as compared to conventional microfluidic devices made from polymers, glass and/or silicon. 65 A promising technique for practical applications in both resource-limited settings and developed ecosystems should be suitable for mass fabrication with minimal fabrication steps, low cost, good mechanical strength and high precision and reproducibility.",
                "In the current work, a two-step process for the selective fabrication of hydrophilic channels and reservoirs on a  In vitro biocompatibility and cell proliferation assays using MEFs on fabricated CH-microPADs in the form of 96 well plates showed good cytocompatibility and cell proliferation. Cellincorporated CH-microPADs can be developed into an easily maintainable 3D cell culture system to be used in tissue transplants such as skin patches for burn injuries and wound care. 66 The cellulose material used to make the CH-microPADs is biocompatible, nontoxic and environment friendly. Also, as a future study, different growth modulators, silver nanoparticles and drug molecules can be incorporated in the CH-microPADs along with cellular components to translate this research into clinical application. The protein adsorption capacity of the fabricated CH-microPADs appeared consistent in the ELISA experiments. The amount of reagents required to do the assay is 5-10 \u03bcL in each step, which saves costly immuno-detection reagents compared to the traditional 96 well plate plastics. This observation expands its scope to be used as an immunodiagnostic device. Current paper based immunodetection devices are mostly limited to test strip-based applications. But, amidst global pandemic crises such as COVID-19, it is essential to develop efficient and cheaper mass diagnostic devices. 96 or 386 well format CH-microPADs would be useful to bring in huge improvements in the immunoassay throughputs at mass point-of-care testing units. The proposed CH-microPADs are cheaper to produce, can be stored in less space at room temperature, and can reduce the use of expensive immune reagents and polluting plastic materials per immunoassay."

                "In this study, an affordable, simple and easily accessible technique is developed for rapid fabrication of low-cost microPADs. The fabrication process can be used to create any device designs or fluidic patterns on porous sheets. The device shapes and designs are cut using a commercial laser cutter, making the process robust and repeatable every time, unlike many other techniques used to fabricate microPADs where repeatability is a major concern. The fabrication steps involve minimal human intervention, making the process ideal for automation, which is a key feature aimed at mass fabrication of CH-microPADs. The devices can be made in an array on A2/A3/ A4 or A5 sheet sizes and be cut and used as needed at the point of need. The fabrication process was characterized and demonstrated by creating different device designs on various types of paper and cloth sheets. The presented technique circumvents the use of clean room facilities and harsh chemicals making it easily accessible for point of use fabrication of microPADs. The fabricated devices are highly robust and chemically stable for a wide range of solvents, strong acids and bases. Moreover, the devices possess very high mechanical strength against bending, folding, twisting and tearing. The fabricated devices are virtually unbreakable since the devices are fabricated through a lamination process commonly used for the protection of paper sheets. In summary, a simple, low-cost and robust rapid prototyping technique is demonstrated for the fabrication of CH-microPADs for biological and healthcare applications. The simplicity and versatility of the fabrication process demonstrated will lead to its widespread adoption in both resource-limited and developed settings."
