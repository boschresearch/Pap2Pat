# DESCRIPTION

## STATEMENT AS TO RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

This research was made, in part, with government support under NIH Grant R01 DA12413 awarded by the National Institutes of Health; the United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides novel compounds that simultaneously inhibit the enzymes Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH), Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and/or Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and therapeutic uses of such compounds.

The compounds of the invention find application in the medical field, in the treatment of pathological conditions in which simultaneous inhibition of FAAH, COX-1 and/or COX-2 activities is desirable.

The combined FAAH and COX-1 and/or COX-2 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of cancer and precancerous conditions and find additional applications in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, pain, eating disorders, anxiety and cardiovascular disorders.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

COX-1 and COX-2 are two enzymes that convert arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2. In mammals, different tissues express varying levels of COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme found in most mammalian cells. COX-2 is an inducible enzyme expressed at low levels in most healthy tissues, but stimulated during inflammation. Both COX-1 and COX-2 are inhibited by compounds belonging to the class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which include aspirin and indomethacin. COX-2 is selectively inhibited by the so-called coxibs, which include celecoxib and rofecoxib.

Both non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors and COX-2-selective inhibitors exert serious side effects when administered to humans. COX-1 inhibition has been correlated to peptic ulcerations, dyspepsia and kidney disease, while selective COX-2 inhibition has been correlated to increased cardiovascular risk.

FAAH is an intracellular serine hydrolase responsible for the deactivating hydrolysis of a family of naturally occurring fatty-acid ethanolamides (FAEs), which include endogenous agonists at cannabinoid receptors, such as anandamide, and at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α), such as oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). Two isoforms of FAAH exist, called FAAH-1 and FAAH-2. Both isoforms are generically referred to here as FAAH. Pharmacological inhibition of FAAH activity magnifies and prolongs the biological actions of these lipid-derived messengers, offering a potential strategy to treat pathological conditions such as pain and inflammation.

Inflammatory pathologies afflict hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Yet the use of current therapies is limited by potentially serious side effects, such as gastric damage, kidney damage and increased risk of stroke.

Therefore, a need still exists for new therapeutically active compounds, which are effective in the treatment of inflammation and related conditions whose administration results in a reduced risk of side effects in humans.

One of the objects of the present invention is to provide compounds acting as combined inhibitors of FAAH, COX-1 and/or COX-2. These compounds are effective in the treatment of conditions where the regulation of these enzymes is desirable.

When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF3 and —CH2CF3), haloalkoxy (e.g., —OCF3 and OCHF2) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH3, —C(O)CF3, —C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).

In certain embodiments alkyl is substituted (i.e. a “substituted alkyl” for example a “substituted (C1-C6)alkyl”) by one or more substituents independently selected from the group comprising hydroxy, alkoxy, amino, monoalkylamino, dialkylamino or carboxylic.

In certain embodiments the term “substituted (C1-C6)alkyl” means a (C1-C6)alkyl moiety/group substituted with OH, COOH, CN, SH, F, NH2, NHR′ or NR′R″ wherein R′, R″ are as defined above; the groups OH, COOH, being preferred.

An “alkoxy” group refers to a (alkyl)O-group wherein alkyl is as defined above.

In general, the term “optionally substituted” or “substituted” means that the referenced group may be substituted with one or more additional group(s) individually and independently selected specifically from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroalicyclic, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulfoxide, arylsulfoxide, alkylsulfone, arylsulfone, cyano, halo, carbonyl, thiocarbonyl, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, perhaloalkyl, perfluoroalkyl, silyl, and amino, including mono- and di-substituted amino groups, and the protected derivatives thereof.

Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents which would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., —OCH2— is intended to also —CH2O—.

The term “heterocycle” refers to heteroaromatic and heteroalicyclic groups containing one to four heteroatoms each selected from O, S and N, wherein each heterocyclic group has from 3 to 9 atoms in its ring system, and with the proviso that the ring of the group does not contain two adjacent O or S atoms.

Specifically, the term “N-heterocycle” refers to heterocyclic groups containing one to four N atoms wherein each heterocyclic group has from 3 to 9 atoms in its ring system.

Herein, whenever the number of carbon atoms in a heterocycle is indicated (for example hetero(C3-C9)cycloalkyl, at least one other atom (the heteroatom) must be present in the ring. Designations such as “hetero(C3-C9)cycloalkyl” refer only to the number of carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. It is understood that the heterocyclic ring can have additional heteroatoms in the ring. Designations such as “4-6 membered heterocycle” refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the ring (i.e., a four, five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or heteroatoms). In heterocycles that have two or more heteroatoms, those two or more heteroatoms can be the same or different from one another. Heterocycles can be optionally substituted. The heterocyclic groups include benzo-fused ring systems. An example of a 4-membered heterocyclic group is azetidinyl (derived from azetidine). An example of a 5-membered heterocyclic group is thiazolyl. An example of a 6-membered heterocyclic group is pyridyl, and an example of a 10-membered heterocyclic group is quinolinyl.

Further, a group derived from imidazole may be imidazol-1-yl or imidazol-3-yl (both N-attached) or imidazol-2-yl, imidazol-4-yl or imidazol-5-yl (all C-attached).

The heterocyclic groups include benzo-fused ring systems and ring systems substituted with one or two oxo (═O) moieties such as pyrrolidin-2-one. Depending on the structure, a heterocycle group can be a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., a heterocyclene group).

Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as “solvates”. For example, a complex with water is known as a “hydrate”. Solvates of the compound of the invention are within the scope of the invention. The compounds of Formula I may readily be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallisation or evaporation of an appropriate solvent to give the corresponding solvates.

In addition, prodrugs are also included within the context of this invention. As used herein, the term “prodrug” means a compound which is converted within the body, e.g. by hydrolysis in the blood, into its active form that has medical effects. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in D. Fleisher, S. Ramon and H. Barbra “Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs”, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130, and in Jarkko Rautio e al., “Prodrugs: design and clinical applications”, Nature Review Drug Discovery, (2008) 7, 255-270 each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure I, Ia, Ib, Ic in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification is cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, yielding the parent compound.

The compounds (I), (Ia), (Ib) of the invention may be in crystalline forms. In certain embodiments, the crystalline forms of the compounds (I) (Ia), (Ib) are polymorphs.

The subject invention also includes isotopically labelled compounds, which are identical to those recited in Formula (I) and following, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulphur, fluorine, iodine, and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I and 125I.

Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of the present invention. Isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. 11C and 18F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (positron emission tomography), and 125I isotopes are particularly useful in SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography), all useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula (I) and following of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.

Certain groups/substituents included in the present invention may be present as isomers or in one or more tautomeric forms. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the compound of the Formulae (I) (Ia), (Ib), may exist in the form of other tautomers or geometrical isomers in some cases, depending on the kinds of the substituents. In the present specification, the compound may be described in only one form of such isomers, but the present invention includes such isomers, isolated forms of the isomers, or a mixture thereof. Furthermore, the compound of the Formulae (I) (Ia) (Ib) may have asymmetric carbon atoms or axial asymmetries in some cases, and correspondingly, it may exist in the form of optical isomers such as an (R)-form, an (S)-form, and the like. The present invention includes within its scope all such isomers, including racemates, enantiomers and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the compound of formula (I) is further separated into its enantiomers, i.e. (R)-enantiomer and (S)-enantiomer. In this case, the enantiomeric separation is performed by chiral HPLC.

In particular, within the scope of the present invention are included all stereoisomeric forms, including enantiomers, diastereoisomers, and mixtures thereof, including racemates and the general reference to the compounds of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), include all the stereoisomeric forms, unless otherwise indicated.

The compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.

In general, the compounds or salts of the invention should be interpreted as excluding those compounds (if any) which are so chemically unstable, either per se or in water, that they are clearly unsuitable for pharmaceutical use through all administration routes, whether oral, parenteral or otherwise. Such compounds are known to the skilled chemist. Prodrugs or compounds which are stable ex vivo and which are convertible in the mammalian (e.g. human) body to the inventive compounds are however included.

Cancer-related inflammation is an important process contributing to malignant disease, with common and defined factors at different stages of progression. As discussed by A. Mantovani et al. (“Cancer-related inflammation”, Nature 454, 436-444, 24 Jul. 2008), the mediators and cellular effectors of inflammation are important constituents of the local environment of tumors. In some types of cancer, inflammatory conditions are present before a malignant change occurs. Conversely, in other types of cancer, an oncogenic change induces an inflammatory microenvironment that promotes the development of tumors. Regardless of its origin, ‘smoldering’ inflammation in the tumor microenvironment has many tumor-promoting effects. It aids in the proliferation and survival of malignant cells, promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, subverts adaptive immune responses, and alters responses to hormones and chemotherapeutic agents.

**Methods for Testing Compounds of the Invention**

**In Vitro Rat FAAH Radiometric Assay**

Rat FAAH was prepared from male Sprague Dawley rat brains, homogenized in a potter in 20 mM of Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.32 M sucrose.

The radiometric assay used to measure FAAH activity was performed in eppendorf tubes: 50 μg of total rat brain homogenate were pre-incubated in 445.5 μL of assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 0.05% Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA)) with 4.5 μL of inhibitor (at appropriate concentration in DMSO) or DMSO alone (to measure FAAH total activity) for 10 minutes at 37° C. The blank (no activity control) was prepared using 445.5 μL of assay buffer and 4.5 μL of DMSO without the 50 μg of total rat brain homogenate.

After 10 minutes of pre-incubation with test compounds, the reaction was started by adding of 50 μL of substrate and incubating for 30 min at 37° C. The substrate was prepared in assay buffer in order to achieve the final concentration of 1 μM arachidonoyl ethanolamide (Cayman Chemical N. 90050) and 0.6 nM anandamide [ethanolamine-1-3H](American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., ART. 0626, conc. 1 mCi/mL, S.A. 60 Ci/mmol). The reaction was stopped by adding cold 1:1 CHCl3/MeOH. After 10 minutes of centrifugation (845×g at 4° C.) 600 μL of aqueous phase were transferred into scintillation vials previously filled with 3 mL of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold™, Perkin Elmer Inc., Cat. 6013329). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (MicroBeta2 LumiJET Perkin Elmer Inc.).

**In Vitro Human FAAH Fluorescent Assay**

Human recombinant FAAH was obtained from a HEK-293 FAAH-1 overexpressing stable cell line. Cells were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, 1% glutamine and 500 μg/mL G418. To obtain membrane preparation cells were scraped off with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation (500×g, 10 minutes, 4° C.); the cell pellet was re-suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.32 M sucrose, disrupted by sonication (10 pulses, 5 times) and centrifuged (800×g, 15 minutes, 4° C.); the collected supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000×g for 1 h at 4° C. and the pellet was re-suspended in PBS.

The fluorescent assay to measure FAAH activity was performed in 96 wells black plates: 2.5 μg of human FAAH-1 membrane preparation were pre-incubated for 50 minutes at 37° C., in 180 μL of assay buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 0.05% Fatty acid-free BSA) with 10 μL of inhibitor or 10 μL DMSO to measure FAAH total activity. The background (no activity) samples were prepared using 180 μL of assay buffer without human FAAH-1 and 10 μL of DMSO. The reaction was then started by the addition of 10 μL of substrate (AMC arachidonyl amide, N. 10005098, Cayman Chemical) dissolved in ethanol and used at a final concentration of 2 μM. The reaction was carried out for 30 minutes at 37° C. and fluorescence was measured with a Tecan Infinite M200 nanoquant plate reader (excitation wavelength 350 nm/emission wavelength 460 nm).

**In Vitro COX Assay**

COX activity was measured using a commercial kit (COX Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit—Cayman Chemical N. 560131) which includes both ovine COX-1 and human recombinant COX-2 enzymes. Inhibitors were pre-incubated with either ovine COX-1 or human COX-2 in order to screen isozyme-specific inhibition. Differently than described in the kit protocol, the reaction was carried out in the presence of 5 μM arachidonic acid while for the blank sample (no activity) the two enzymes were inactivated for 40 minutes at 100° C. It was then measured the amount of PGF2α produced by reduction with SnCl2 of COX-derived PGH2, via enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a PG-specific antibody and competing with a PG-acetylcholinesterase conjugate.

Absorbance was measured at 412 nm with a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader and data were processed according to manufacturer's instructions.

The median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the Log [concentration]/response curves generated with mean replicate values using a four parameter Hill equation curve fitting with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA-USA). IC50 of the examples 1-20 reported in aforementioned Table 1 are provided below. Values are means of ≧3 experiments performed in duplicate

Examples (5), (8), (11-14) (16) and (18-20) show a multitarget inhibition activity against FAAH, and both COX-1 and COX-2. These examples show a better multitarget FAAH/COX activity compared to the ibu-am5, which is the most active multitarget FAAH/COX compound reported to date in the literature. Ibu-am5 is reported to have FAAH IC50=2.7 μM, and COX-inhibiting similar to ibuprofen (Holt S. et al., J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007, 565, 26; Fowler C. J. et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009, 156, 412; Fowler C. J. et al., Journal of Enzyme Inhibition and Medicinal Chemistry, 2012, 6, 1).

**Materials and Methods**

**Animals**

Male CD1 mice, weighing 25-30 g, (Charles River, Calco, Italy) were used. Procedures were in accordance with the Ethical Guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain and were approved by Italian regulations on protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (D.M. 116192) as well as with European Economic Community regulations (O.J. of E.C. L 358/1 Dec. 18, 1986). Mice were housed in groups of 5 in ventilated cages containing autoclaved cellulose paper as nesting material, with free access to food and water. They were maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00 a.m.), at controlled temperature (21±1° C.) and relative humidity (55±10%). The animals are randomly divided in groups of 6 mice. Behavioral testing was performed between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Scientists running the experiments were not aware of the treatment protocol at the time of the test (blind procedure).

**Carrageenan Test**

The pro-inflammatory agent A-carrageenan (1% weight-vol−1 in sterile water, 50 μL) was injected into the left hind paw of slightly restrained mice, and paw volume was measured with a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy), while thermal hyperalgesia was assessed by the method of Hargreaves et al. (1988), measuring the latency to withdraw the hind paw from a focused beam of radiant heat (thermal intensity: infrared 3.0) in a plantar test apparatus (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Cutoff time was set at 30 s. Withdrawal latencies were measured on both ipsilateral and contralateral paws at various time points after drug administration.

Drug solutions were prepared immediately before use in saline containing 10% PEG-400 and 10% Tween 80 and orally administered in a volume of 2.5 mL-kg−1 before intraplantar injection of carrageenan.

The in vivo efficacy and toxicity of Compound A (selective COX inhibitor) is here compared with the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of the structurally related compound of example 12 (multitarget FAAH/COX inhibitor compound) (Table 2).

**Gastric Lesions**

To study the gastric irritation the protocol of Chan et al. (1995) was followed. Briefly, food-deprived (18-24 h) mice, using an oral gavage, received the COX inhibitor flurbiprofen (Kumar et al., 2008) (3-30 mg/kg, compound A in Table and figures), compound of the example 12 of the invention (3-100 mg/kg), or vehicle. Furthermore, a single pharmacologically effective dose of flurbiprofen (30 mg/kg), was studied in combination with compound of the example 12 (3-30 mg/kg). After 4 h, the mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. The stomachs were removed, opened, rinsed in PBS, and the stomach lining was photographed. Scoring was done by observers blinded to experimental conditions, as previously reported (Jain et al., 2002): red coloration=0.5; spot ulcers=1; hemorrhagic streaks=1.5. If 3 or 4 ulcers were observed, a value of 2 was added to the score. If 5 or more ulcers were observed, a value of 3 was added to the score. The overall ulceration index was the sum of these scores, with a maximal value of 6.

**Statistical Analyses**

Results are expressed as the mean±S.E.M., or 95% confidence limits (95% CL). Efficacy data were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's test for multiple comparisons. For gastric toxicity, the significance of differences between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni's test for multiple comparisons.

**Results**

Anti-inflammatory effects (FIG. 1, graphics A and C) and antihyperalgesic effects (FIG. 1, graphics B and D) in the mouse carrageenan model of acute inflammation. As shown in FIG. 1, the oral administration of compound of example 12 of the invention (3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent and persistent suppression of carrageenan-induced inflammation and hyperalgesia. ED50 values for compound of the example 12 of the invention were 10 mg/kg on edema (Δ volume paw, CL 95%=14.2-119.8 mg/kg), and 10 mg/kg on thermal hyperalgesia (withdrawal latency, CL 95%=11.6-92.9 mg/kg). To further underline the unique pharmacological profile of multitarget FAAH/COX inhibitor compounds, we compare the potent FAAH/COX inhibitor of example 12 with compound A (selective COX inhibitor, Table 2). Compound of the example 12 of the invention given orally was more potent than oral compound A (3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg) at inhibiting the responses induced by carrageenan. ED50 values for compound A were 30 mg/kg on edema (Δ volume paw, CL 95%=3.3-79.2 mg/kg), and 30 mg/kg on thermal hyperalgesia (withdrawal latency, CL 95%=7.2-72.8 mg/kg).

**Effects on Qastric Ulcers**

Irritation of the gastric mucosa is a common adverse event associated with the use of indomethacin and other NSAID COX inhibitors (Sostres et al., 2010).

Oral administration of flurbiprofen (30 mg/kg, compound A) to food-deprived mice was accompanied by profound gastric irritation and appearance of gastric ulcers, as shown in FIG. 2. It appears evident from FIG. 2 that the administration of compound of example 12 of the invention had no ulcerogenic effect up to 100 mg/kg.
