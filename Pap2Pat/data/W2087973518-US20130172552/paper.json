    "abstract": "The Rho GTPase Rac regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization to form cell surface extensions (lamellipodia) required for cell migration/invasion during cancer metastasis. Rac hyperactivation and overexpression are associated with aggressive cancers; thus, interference of the interaction of Rac with its direct upstream activators, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), is a viable strategy for inhibiting Rac activity. We synthesized EHop-016, a novel inhibitor of Rac activity, based on the structure of the established Rac/Rac GEF inhibitor NSC23766. Herein, we demonstrate that EHop-016 inhibits Rac activity in the MDA-MB-435 metastatic cancer cells that overexpress Rac and exhibits high endogenous Rac activity. The IC50 of 1.1 \u03bcm for Rac inhibition by EHop-016 is \u223c100-fold lower than for NSC23766. EHop-016 is specific for Rac1 and Rac3 at concentrations of \u22645 \u03bcm. At higher concentrations, EHop-016 inhibits the close homolog Cdc42. In MDA-MB-435 cells that demonstrate high active levels of the Rac GEF Vav2, EHop-016 inhibits the association of Vav2 with a nucleotide-free Rac1(G15A), which has a high affinity for activated GEFs. EHop-016 also inhibits the Rac activity of MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells and reduces Rac-directed lamellipodia formation in both cell lines. EHop-016 decreases Rac downstream effects of PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) activity and directed migration of metastatic cancer cells. Moreover, at effective concentrations (<5 \u03bcm), EHop-016 does not affect the viability of transformed mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) and reduces viability of MDA-MB-435 cells by only 20%. Therefore, EHop-016 holds promise as a targeted therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic cancers with high Rac activity.",

                "Synthesis of EHop-016-The inhibition of Rac1 activity has been proposed as a strategy for the prevention of cancer metastasis. However, the frequently utilized small molecule Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 only has a moderate biological effect on the highly metastatic cancer cell line MDA-MB-435, even at high concentrations, thus illustrating the need for more potent and effective inhibitors. We recently reported the synthesis of novel NSC23766 derivatives that were more efficient than the parent compound in MDA-MB-435 cells with a considerable reduction of cell functions regulated by Rac (57). Further optimization of the NSC23766 lead structure led to the identification of EHop-016, which was synthesized according to the procedure described in the legend to Fig. 1.",

                "Molecular Docking of EHop-016-NSC23766 was designed to prevent the activation of Rac1 by binding to the region where several GEFs interact with Rac1, thus inhibiting its activation. This mode of action was recently confirmed via analysis of the crystal structure of Rac1 with NSC23766. For the design of novel, more potent inhibitors, we wished to improve the activity and maintain the selectivity profile of NSC23766. Therefore, in order to obtain a similar binding interaction for the new inhibitors, the core structural features of NSC23766 were maintained, including a central pyrimidine core with an aromatic 4-substituent and an amino group-containing 2-substituent, both connected to the pyrimidine core via nitrogen atoms. Clustering of the docking results revealed that the largest cluster (size \u03ed 29) also had the docking conformation with the lowest energy (\u03ea7.91 kcal/mol), and the most favorable conformation is illustrated in Fig. 1B, together with the position of NSC23766 in the crystal structure of the Rac1-NSC23766 complex. Whereas NSC23766 is stretched over the surface of Rac1, similar to the other novel Rac1 inhibitors that were recently identified (60), EHop-016 appears to favor a bent conformation that binds to a deeper binding pocket similar to the N,N-diethylamino group of NSC23766. In its energetically most favorable conformation, the binding of EHop-016 is strengthened by two hydrogen bonding interactions with residues Asp-38 and Asn-39. Furthermore, EHop-016 has a close interaction with Trp-56, which has been shown to be critical for binding of Rac to its GEFs (48,53,54). Two smaller clusters (sizes \u03ed 13 and 21) with lowest energy conformations of \u03ea7.61 and \u03ea7.41 kcal/mol, respectively, dock into the same cleft, albeit in a somewhat different mode (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on the above molecular docking results, structural similarity to NSC23766, and the biological activity profile described herein, it is reasonable to postulate that EHop-016 also interferes with binding of Rac1 with its GEFs via binding to the three-way junction site that contains the switch I, switch II, and \u2424 loops of the effector region of Rac that interacts with the DH domain of Rac GEFs (67). The crystal structures of a complex of the binding domains of the homologous GEF Vav1 with Rac1 were described recently (49,68). Using this information, analysis of binding interactions indicates that unlike NSC23766, EHop-016 interacts with several of the amino acid residues that form the putative binding pocket of Vav1 with Rac1. More specifically, of the residues that are calculated to interact with EHop-016, Vav1 interacts with residues Thr-35, Val-36, and Asn-39 of switch I and with residues Ala-59 and Tyr-64 of switch II (Fig. 1B). Therefore, it is suggested that EHop-016 binds tightly to key amino acid residues of Rac1, potentially inhibiting interaction with Vav.",

                        "Effect of EHop-016 on Activity of Other Rho Family GTPases-In order to investigate the selectivity of EHop-016, we studied its effect on other Rho family GTPases. Similar to Rac1, the Rac isoform Rac3 that is also overexpressed in cancer cells was inhibited by 58% at a concentration of 1 M EHop-016 (Fig. 3A). This is expected because Rac1 and Rac3 demonstrate significant structure similarity and are activated by the same GEFs. EHop-016 did not affect the activity of the Rac homolog Cdc42 at 2 or 4 M but inhibited Cdc42 activity by 28% at 5 M and 74% at 10 M (Fig. 3B). Therefore, EHop-016 may not bind the similar DH-interacting domain of Cdc42 as tightly as Rac but is able to inhibit Cdc42 activity at higher concentrations. In contrast, the activity of the closely related Rho GTPase RhoA was increased \u03f31.3-fold in response to 2, 4, 5, or 10 M EHop-016. Increased Rho activity, when Rac is being inhibited by EHop-016, may be a compensatory mechanism. This is expected to increase Rho-regulated assembly of F-actin into stress fibers and further inhibit Rac-mediated lamellipodia formation and directed migration (1,4,10).",
                        "EHop-016 Inhibits Association of Active Vav2 with Rac1(G15A) Mutant Fusion Protein-To investigate a mechanism for the inhibition of Rac by EHop-016, the active Rac GEFs in MDA-MB-435 cells were detected from pull-downs of a glu-tathione-agarose-conjugated GST fusion protein of a Rac1 nucleotide-free mutant Rac1(G15A) that has a high affinity for activated GEFs (66,69). As shown in Fig. 4A, in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 cell line with elevated Rac activity, Vav2 appears to be more abundant compared with Tiam-1 and Trio. Although equal amounts of total protein were used for Western blotting, it is possible that the differences in GEF expression may reflect the relative affinities with their specific antibodies. Moreover, in MDA-MB-435 cells growing in 10% serum, only active Vav2 was pulled down with the GST-Rac1(G15A) and not Tiam-1 or Trio (Fig. 4A). We show that the association of Vav2 with Rac1(G15A) was inhibited by 4 M EHop-016 to \u03f350% compared with controls in a statistically significant manner (p \u03fd 0.005) (Fig. 4, B andC). Because we did not detect association of Tiam-1 with Rac1(G15A) under our experimental conditions, the effect of EHop-016 on the interaction of Rac1 and Tiam-1 could not be measured in vivo.",
                        "When Rac1(G15A) beads were incubated with a purified Tiam-1 DH/PH domain as described previously (67,70), the active Tiam-1 was associated with the Rac1(G15A) beads. However, EHop-016 inhibited the interaction of Tiam-1 DH/PH domain with Rac1(G15A) at concentrations of \u054640 M (supplemental Fig. S2). At 5 M, EHop-016 did not affect the interaction of Tiam-1 DH/PH domain with Rac1(G15A) beads. At 50 M EHop-016, there was a statistically significant 64% inhibition of Tiam-1/Rac1(G15A) interaction. In contrast, the parent compound NSC23766 inhibited the Rac1(G15A) interaction with purified Tiam-1 DH/PH domain at both 5 and 50 M. Therefore, the concentrations at which EHop-016 inhibited Tiam-1/Rac1 interaction were 10 times higher than the physiological concentrations (2-4 M) at which EHop-016 inhibited Rac activity or the interaction of Rac1(G15A) with Vav2 in MDA-MB-435 cell lysates.",

Therefore, we investigated the effect of EHop-016 on Rac activity and lamellipodia formation in the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and the highly metastatic variant of MDA-MB-435. As shown in Fig. 5A, for equal amounts of total protein, Rac expression and activity in MDA-MB-231 cells were less when compared with MDA-MB-435 cells. EHop-016 at 2 M (double the IC 50 for Rac inhibition) inhibited the Rac activity of MDA-MB-435 cells by 79% and by 93% at 4 M. The Rac activity of MDA-MB-231 cells was also inhibited by EHop-016 with an IC 50 of \u03f33 M (Fig. 5A). Therefore, EHop-016 is more efficient at inhibiting MDA-MB-435 cells with elevated Rac activity. Lamellipodia extension was determined in cells stained with rhodamine phalloidin to localize F-actin. Treatment for 24 h with EHop-016 at 2 and 4 M inhibited lamellipodia formation in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells. Results show that close to 100% of control cells demonstrated lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. Following EHop-016 treatment, at 4 M in MDA-MB-231 cells and both 2 and 4 M in MDA MB-435 cells, only \u03f330% of the cells extended lamellipodia.

By Western blotting with a specific antibody to the kinase active form of PAK1 with a phospho-Thr-423 (72), we show that EHop-016 dramatically inhibits PAK activity at both 2 and 4 M (Fig. 6A). Because Rac/PAK signaling regulates directed cell migration, the effect of EHop-016 at 0 -5 M was determined on migration of MDA-MB-435 cells by using a Transwell assay. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment with 2 and 5 M EHop-016 reduced directed cell migration by \u03f360% at concentrations that reduced Rac activity by \u03f380% (Figs. 2 and4). It is possible that Rac may not be the only regulator of cell migration in this highly invasive cancer cell line.

Similarly, EHop-016 is probably not specific to Trio, a GEF that shares the amino acid residue Trp-56 in Rac1 with Tiam-1, as a critical determinant for their activity (75).",
                                "The significant finding that EHop-016 inhibits the interaction of Vav2 with Rac1 at physiologically relevant concentrations is central to the further development of this compound as an inhibitor of cancer malignancy. Both Vav2 and Tiam-1 have been implicated in Rac-mediated transformation and invasion/ metastasis (76, 77). To our knowledge, no specific inhibitors for  "

                                "Vav2/Rac interaction have been described. Using an established method for detecting active Rac GEFs from cell lysates (66, 69), we found that Vav2, and not Tiam-1 or Trio, was active in the MDA-MB-435 cell line in culture. It is possible that low active levels of Tiam-1 and Trio were not detected due to the limited sensitivity of immunoblotting. Another alternative is that the serum in culture medium activated Vav2 preferentially, and future studies will be conducted in quiescent cells following epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 stimulation, which is expected to activate both Vav2 and Tiam-1.",
                                "Vav2 has been shown to act as an exchange factor for Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 in vitro (50,78). The increased Rho activity following EHop-016 treatment may be due to a complex biological response to Rac inhibition. Studies have shown that Rac activation can inhibit Rho activity and vice versa (1,4,10). Indeed, disparate roles have been proposed for Vav2-activated Rho and Rac in mammary epithelial cells (79), thus suggesting that EHop-016-mediated inhibition of Rac/Vav2 interaction may result in enhanced Vav2 availability for Rho activation. Binding studies of Rho and EHop-016 will be conducted in future studies to rule out a role for EHop-016 in direct activation of Rho.",
                                "We also show that cancer cell viability is not affected by EHop-016 at concentrations that inhibit Rac and actin cytoskeletal changes. Racs have been shown to affect cell survival via a number of signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor B (NF-B), and Jun kinase (JNK)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (80). However, at the concentrations that inhibit Rac-mediated lamellipodia extension, we do not see significant effects of EHop-016 on cell viability. Cell viability may be affected at higher concentrations (\u05465 mM), when EHop-016 inhibits both Rac and Cdc42 activities. This is expected because in addition to regulation of cell migration, Rho GTPases have also been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle (10). Our data demonstrating that EHop-016 does not affect the viability of mammary epithelial cells at effective concentrations suggest its utility as a viable anti-metastatic cancer therapeutic agent with only minor toxicity to normal cells. In preliminary studies, we have tested the effect of oral administration of EHop-016 to athymic nude mice at 1 mg/kg body weight once a week for 9 weeks and found no change in body weight or gross indications of toxicity (supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, EHop-016 holds promise as a non-toxic and specific Rac inhibitor for further development as an anti-cancer metastasis therapeutic.",
                                "Results show that EHop-016 reduced lamellipodia and directed cell migration by 60 -70% at concentrations that do not affect cell viability but inhibit Rac activity by \u03f380%. At a concentration of 2 M, EHop-016 exerted a dramatic reduction in lamellipodia formation without affecting Cdc42-induced filopodia extension. The concentration at which EHop-016 inhibited lamellipodia extension and cell migration is \u03f310 -50fold less than the reported concentrations of NSC23766 and EHT 1864 required to inhibit lamellipodia extension and cell migration (48,57,81). This result is similar to our previous report of decreased MDA-MB-435 cell migration in the presence of other NSC23766 derivatives that inhibit Rac activity (57). Although a single report demonstrated increased migration of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells following 50 -100 M NSC23766, in our hands, treatment with 100 M NSC23766 for 24 h resulted in a 75% decrease in MDA-MB-435 cell migration (data not shown). Moreover, there are several reports of decreased cell migration in metastatic breast cancer cells following direct inhibition of Rac1 and Rac3 by expression of dominant negative Rac and siRNA knockdown of Rac expression or by indirect inhibition of Rac by blocking upstream effector activity (13,18,57,(82)(83)(84)(85)(86)(87).",
                                "In conclusion, we have shown that EHop-016 is an effective Rac-specific inhibitor at micromolar concentrations. EHop-016 substantially inhibits Vav2 interaction with Rac, Rac-activated PAK1, lamellipodia formation, and cell migration. Because Rac/PAK activity is central to cancer cell migration and invasion (30), EHop-016 appears to be a promising candidate for further development as a pharmacological inhibitor of Rac activity in metastatic cancer cells. In addition, EHop-016 could prove to be a valuable, more potent probe for the study of Rac-regulated cellular processes."
