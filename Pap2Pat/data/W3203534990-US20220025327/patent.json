                        "Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are a novel lymphoid cell subfamily belonging to the innate immune system. The different ILC are developmentally related and characterized by a lymphoid morphology, the lack of gene-dependent rearrangement of antigen receptors and the absence of myeloid and dendritic phenotypical markers. Like helper T-cell subsets, ILC can be divided into three different groups according to distinct phenotypes, cytokine-secretion profiles and essential transcription factors [1,2].",
                        "Natural killer (NK) cells, which are considered as the prototypical ILC, are important cytotoxic cells [1]. They provide wide anti-tumor and anti-microbial protection upon activation by the release of cytolytic granules containing perforin and granzyme B. Besides cytotoxic effects, NK cells also contribute to immunomodulation by producing cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3 [3,4]. NK cells, like other lymphocytes, originate from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow that differentiate through a common lymphoid progenitor stage. In secondary lymphoid tissues, human NK cell development is pursued whereby the cells sequentially develop into stage 1 (CD34+CD45RA+CD117\u2212CD94\u2212) pro-NK cells, followed by stage 2 or pre-NK cells (CD34+CD45RA+CD117+CD94\u2212). Stage 1 and stage 2 cells are multipotent as they have T-cell, dendritic cell and NK cell developmental potential. Stage 3 cells (CD34\u2212CD117+CD94\u2212CD16\u2212) are committed NK cell precursors since they can no longer develop into T-cells and dendritic cells. Stage 4 (CD34\u2212CD56brightCD94+CD16\u2212) and stage 5 (CD34\u2212CD56dimCD94+CD16+) are mature NK cells [5,6]. Differentiation and maturation of NK cells and ILC is a complex molecular process tightly regulated by transcription factors. Many essential factors have been identified in the transcriptional control of murine ILC differentiation, thanks to the generation and availability of transcription factor-deficient mice [7]. In contrast to mice, the current knowledge on the role of transcription factors in human NK and ILC differentiation is extremely limited.",
                        "T-bet and Eomesodermin (Eomes) are two T-box transcription factors. T-bet is a protein encoded by the Tbx21 gene that is only expressed in hematopoietic cells. Eomes also plays an important role in vertebrate embryogenesis and shares homology with T-bet. T-bet is known as a master regulator essential for T-cell effector functions, including IFN-\u03b3 production and cytotoxicity. Moreover, T-bet and Eomes play a critical role in differentiation, maintenance and function of murine NK cells and ILC [8]. T-bet-deficient mice and Eomesflox/flox Vav-Cre+ mice show decreased numbers of NK cells that mainly have an immature phenotype [9,11]. Mice lacking both T-bet and Eomes completely fail to develop NK cells [11]. These knockout mouse models show that both T-bet and Eomes are indispensable for NK cell development and terminal NK cell maturation. Furthermore, T-bet and Eomes are needed to maintain a mature NK cell phenotype, highlighted by the loss of maturity markers after induced deletion of T-bet/Eomes in mature NK cells [10]. Next to NK cells, particular subsets of ILC depend on T-bet and/or Eomes for their development. CD127+ ILC1 and natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)+ ILC3 express T-bet but lack Eomes. Eomesflox/flox Vav-Cre+ mice have decreased numbers of NK cells but maintain ILC1. In contrast, T-bet-deficient mice have fewer NK cells, but completely lack ILC1. Mice lacking both T-bet and Eomes show a complete lack of ILC1. Also, no NCR+ ILC3 develop in the intestine of T-bet-deficient mice [9-12].",
                        "Because of their anti-tumor role, NK cells are abundantly researched as promising agents for cancer immunotherapy. Of the different NK cell-based therapeutic strategies one is the adoptive transfer of HSC into cancer patients. The other is to first differentiate HSC in vitro into mature NK cells that are then expanded to obtain sufficient NK cell numbers for transplantation. Whereas different approaches using NK cells in cancer therapy have already been used in the clinic, there still are some major limitations leading to relapse. Analysis of adoptively transferred mature NK cells in different murine tumor models revealed an exhaustion of the transferred NK cells, resulting in decreased cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production [13]. Importantly, this exhausted NK cell phenotype could be attributed to downregulation of the transcription factors T-BET and EOMES [13]. More recently, research proved that reduced T-BET and EOMES expression is also responsible for the NK cell functional impairment after HSC transplantation in leukemia patients. Reduction of T-BET and EOMES expression is already observed early after HSC transplantation. Downregulation of these transcription factors in NK cells is associated with increased nonrelapse mortality [14]. The role of thymocyte selection-associated HMG box protein (TOX) on the differentiation of human NK cells has been studied by Yun et al. [15] and in WO2012/046940. Vong et al. (2014) disclose that another member of the thymocyte selection-associated HMG box protein family, i.e. TOX2, is required in normal maturation of human NK cells and directly relates to T-BET expression [16]. CAR-T cells overexpressing T-BET are disclosed in WO2017/190100 and by Gacerez and Sentman [17].",
                        "Here, we reveal a method to accelerate human NK cell maturation from umbilical cord blood HSC in vitro, using retroviral constitutive overexpression constructs of either T-BET or EOMES. Whereas control transduced HSC require a culture period of 14 to 21 days to differentiate into mature functional NK cells, NK cells already appear on day 3 of culture with T-BET- or EOMES-transduced HSC. These early arising NK cells have a fully mature phenotype and are also highly functional regarding specific cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 production. Importantly, the NK cells also display enhanced ADCC activity. This accelerated NK cell differentiation and maturation of NK cells with enhanced ADCC activity upon T-BET or EOMES transduction of HSC can provide a novel tool to optimize the NK cell-based adoptive cell therapies."

                                "Accelerated Human NK Cell Development Upon T-BET and EOMES Overexpression",
                                "To investigate the regulatory role of transcription factors T-BET and EOMES in human NK cell development, overexpression constructs of both T-BET and EOMES were made, whereby human cDNA of T-BET or EOMES was cloned separately into the LZRS-IRES-eGFP retroviral vector. These overexpression constructs were transduced on day \u22122 in human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ HSC, in parallel to an empty control vector. At day 0, transduced HSC were sorted as lineage\u2212(CD3/CD14/CD19/CD56) CD34+eGFP+ cells that were subsequently differentiated in the NK/ILC3 culture. From day 0, overexpression of T-BET and EOMES in eGFP+ cells was confirmed at regular time points at the protein level by flow cytometry, showing that overexpression was maintained throughout the culture period (FIG. 1a). On day 3, nearly no HSC, stage 1 and stage 2 NK cell progenitors were left in T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures, whereas these populations were still clearly present in the control-transduced cultures. Also less stage 3 cells were found with T-BET and EOMES overexpression in comparison to control transduced cells (FIG. 1b). In sharp contrast, mature CD56+CD94+ NK cells, comprising stage 4 and stage 5 NK cells, were already present on day 3 of the T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures, whereas NK cells only became detectable from day 14 in the control-transduced cells (FIG. 2a). On day 7, CD56+CD94+CD16+ NK cells, which are mature stage 5 NK cells, were present in the T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures. In control cultures, stage 5 NK cells only appeared on day 21 (FIGS. 2b and 2c). Thus, both the percentages as well as the absolute numbers of stage 4 and stage 5 NK cells were significantly increased upon T-BET and EOMES overexpression at day 3, 7 and 14 (FIG. 2c-d)). With T-BET and EOMES overexpression, 21.5\u00b14.3% and 35.2\u00b19.7%, respectively, of total NK cells expressed CD16 on day 21 of culture, compared to 11.9\u00b14.9% in control-transduced NK cells. Also the CD16 expression intensity was significantly higher in EOMES-overexpressing NK cells (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) 6266\u00b12709) compared to control NK cells (MFI 3984\u00b11971) on day 21 of culture. The CD16 expression intensity of NK cells transduced with T-BET (MFI 4066\u00b11457) did not differ significantly from control transduced NK cells.",
                                "Currently, in vitro-generated NK cells used in NK cell immunotherapy are usually cultured in the absence of stromal feeder cells. To test whether accelerated NK cell differentiation upon T-BET or EOMES overexpression in HSC is also possible in a feeder-free system, transduced HSC were cultured in the NK cell/ILC3 differentiation culture, in the absence of EL08.1D2 feeder cells. The results show that, similar to NK cell cultures with stromal feeder cells, stage 4 NK cells were already present from day 3 of culture with both T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures, whereas NK cells only became detectable on day 14 in control-cultures (FIGS. 3a and c). Furthermore, on day 7 of both the overexpression cultures mature stage 5 NK cells were present, whereas these mature NK cells only appeared on day 14 in the control-transduced cells (FIGS. 3b and c). The absolute cell number of mature stage 4 and stage 5 NK cells increased upon T-BET and EOMES overexpression at day 3, 7 and 14 (FIG. 3c), similar to the NK cell cultures with stromal feeder cells. Together, these data indicate that the presence of a feeder-layer does not influence the NK cell maturation upon T-BET and EOMES overexpression in HSC.",
                                "Because T-BET and EOMES overexpression in HSC led to extreme acceleration of NK cell differentiation, we reasoned that T-BET or EOMES overexpression might overrule the need for IL-15 in the culture medium. IL-15 is an important cytokine for NK cell development and differentiation through IL-2R\u03b2 signaling in NK cell precursors. Results of cultures without IL-15 in the cytokine mix showed that, as control transduced HSC,-also T-BET- or EOMES-transduced HSC could not develop into NK cells on day 3. Even on day 14 of the culture period, no NK cells developed upon T-BET or EOMES overexpression, nor with control transduced cells (FIG. 4). This means that T-BET or EOMES overexpression in HSC does not overrule the necessity for IL-15 during NK cell differentiation. Moreover, with T-BET and EOMES overexpression in HSC, IL2R6 mRNA is upregulated in EOMES-transduced compared to control transduced HSC on day 0 (FIG. 9a). Cumulatively, this indicates that early precursors remain dependent on IL-15 for NK cell differentiation from HSCs upon T-BET or EOMES overexpression. In contrast to the accelerated and increased differentiation of NK cells, much less ILC3 developed upon T-BET and EOMES overexpression compared to the control (FIG. 5a), suggesting that ILC3 development is strongly inhibited by T-BET and EOMES overexpression. Furthermore, no B cells, T cells or NKT cells developed in the control or T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures (FIG. 5b). Altogether, the differentiation of T-BET or EOMES transduced-HSC is thus completely skewed towards NK cell development, wherein differentiation towards stage 4 and stage 5 NK cells is drastically accelerated.",
                                "Early Arising NK Cells Upon T-BET and EOMES Overexpression Express a Mature NK Cell Phenotype",
                                "In order to further characterize the early arising NK cells upon T-BET and EOMES transduction of HSC, their phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry using a panel of mature NK cell markers. As differentiating NK cells gradually express activating NK cell receptors, NKG2D and NKp46 expression was evaluated. NKG2D was expressed by NK cells from day 3 of the EOMES overexpression cultures, at a level comparable to day 14 control transduced NK cells (FIG. 6a-b). The NK cells upon T-BET overexpression also expressed NKG2D on day 3 of culture, although at a lower level compared to day 14 control transduced NK cells (FIG. 6a-b). Similar to NKG2D, NKp46 expression by NK cells with T-BET overexpression was delayed and only reached higher levels on day 7, while with EOMES overexpression NKp46 expression was expressed on day 3 at a comparable level to day 14 control transduced NK cells, and was expressed at higher levels on day 7 in comparison to control transduced NK cells (FIG. 6a-b). Next to activating NK cell receptors, mature NK cells also express killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Evaluation of KIR expression by NK cells obtained at day 3 or day 7 upon T-BET and EOMES overexpression showed that KIR expression was extremely upregulated in comparison to day 14 control transduced NK cells (FIG. 6a-b). Finally, other markers that indicate functional NK cell maturation are cytoplasmic expression of perforin and granzyme B, which are both important cytotoxic mediators. On day 3, perforin and granzyme B were similarly expressed by NK cells in both the T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures as compared to day 14 control transduced cells. At day 7, perforin expression in both T-BET and EOMES overexpressing NK cells tended to rise, but did not reach significant higher amounts in comparison to day 14 control NK cells (FIG. 6a-b). In contrast, granzyme B expression by NK cells with EOMES overexpression was significantly higher on day 3 of culture in comparison to day 14 control NK cells (FIG. 6a-b).",
                                "Perforin and granzyme B proteins are known to be contained in the cytotoxic granules of NK cells. We therefore performed microscopic analysis of sorted NK cells from day 3 and day 7 overexpression cultures, and from day 19 control cultures. The results show that NK cells from day 3 and day 7 T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures had multiple cytotoxic granules in their cytoplasm, at equal numbers compared to day 19 control NK cells (FIG. 6c). In conclusion, T-BET or EOMES overexpression in HSC results in accelerated differentiation of human NK cells with a complete mature phenotype, which also contain cytotoxic granules in their cytoplasm.",
                                "The Early Arising NK Cells Upon T-BET and EOMES Overexpression are Functionally Mature",
                                "The most important function of mature NK cells is killing of malignant and virus-infected cells. Because the early arising NK cells, upon T-BET or EOMES overexpression in HSC, express both perforin and granzyme B and contain cytoplasmic granules, we reasoned that they also have cytotoxic potential. Therefore, cytotoxic assays were performed with the human NK cell susceptible K562 cell line as target cells. The results show that NK cells from day 21 T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures mediated comparable cytotoxicity as day 21 control NK cells (FIG. 7a). To correlate the target cell lysis with cytotoxic granule degranulation, CD107a expression was determined, whereby day 21 NK cells from T-BET or EOMES overexpression cultures and control cultures were challenged with K562 cells in a 2 h degranulation assay. CD107a expression in both NK cells from T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures was significantly lower in comparison to control transduced NK cells (FIG. 7b).",
                                "Another important function of mature NK cells is the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, whereby they are able to influence other immune cells. Therefore, we stimulated day 21 NK cells from both overexpression and control cultures with PMA and ionomycin or with a combination of IL-12, IL-18 with or without IL-15. IFN-\u03b3 production of T-BET and EOMES overexpressing versus control NK cells was comparable after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, and was higher upon IL-12/IL-18 or IL-12/IL-18/IL-15 stimulation (FIG. 7c). In contrast, TNF-\u03b1 production of T-BET or EOMES overexpressing NK cells was significantly lower than control transduced NK cells for both the PMA/ionomycin and the IL-12/IL-18/IL-15 conditions (FIG. 7c). We can conclude that NK cells obtained upon T-BET and EOMES overexpression in HSC not only have a mature phenotype but are also functionally mature, both regarding cytotoxicity as well as IFN-\u03b3 production.",

CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII) is the main activating Fc-receptor widely expressed on NK cells and induces killing by ADCC. Significantly more CD16+ NK cells, both in percentages as well as in absolute cell numbers, were obtained in T-BET and EOMES overexpression cultures as compared to control cultures (FIG. 2c-d), and NK cells from the EOMES overexpression cultures also express CD16 at a higher intensity.",
                                "With regard to the therapeutic potential of the T-BET and/or EOMES overexpressing NK cells, we therefore tested their ADCC capacity. For this purpose, the CD20-expressing human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji was used as target in the presence or absence of Rituximab (RTX), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody that is used in cancer immunotherapy. The results show that both T-BET and EOMES overexpressing as well as control NK cells displayed ADCC, but the ADCC capacity of EOMES-overexpressing NK cells was significantly higher as compared to control NK cells (FIG. 8a). This was confirmed by CD107a degranulation analysis (FIG. 8b). The lower percentage of CD16+ NK cells and their lower CD16 expression intensity upon T-BET compared to EOMES overexpression can account for the lack of a stronger ADCC-response in T-BET overexpressing NK cells (FIG. 2d). Altogether, our results show that NK cells overexpressing EOMES display higher ADCC.",

In addition to transcription factors, also perforin (PRF1), granzyme B (GZMB) and IL2RB were higher expressed in EOMES-transduced HSC.

Moreover, ETS-1 deficiency in human HSC results in decreased NK cell differentiation in vitro, revealing a critical role for ETS-1 in human NK cell development [22]. The lack of mature NK cells was reported in mice that are deficient in Thymocyte Selection Associated High Mobility Group Box (TOX) [7]. This defect was also seen in human in vitro NK cell cultures, whereby the mature NK cell population decreases [15].",

ID2 overexpression in HSC did not result in significant differences in NK cell maturation in comparison to control transduced cells (FIG. 10a). Whereas TOX overexpression did not affect stage 5 NK cell differentiation, it did inhibit generation of stage 4 NK cells (FIG. 10a). Our findings are different from results of Yun S. et al.
