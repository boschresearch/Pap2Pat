    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the field of chemical analysis detection and application, in particular to a marker peptide of snake venom thrombin-like enzymes (SVTLEs) from Agkistrodon Halys Pallas and an application thereof. The amino acid sequence of the marker peptide of snake venom thrombin-like enzymes (SVTLEs) from Agkistrodon Halys Pallas is TLCAGVMEGGIDTCNR.

                                "As unique snake species in China, Agkistrodon Halys Pallas is mainly distributed in Changbai Mountain Area in the northeast and is also called as the subspecies of Agkistrodon Halys Pallas. Snake venom thrombin extracted from the venom of Agkistrodon Halys Pallas is serine protease having the arginine esterase activity and the amido enzyme activity, may play a key role during coagulation and is called as \u201cthrombin-like enzyme\u201d due to the similar structure and function with human thrombin-like enzyme. The snake venom thrombin is mainly clinically used for treating hemorrhagic diseases, especially bleeding of blood capillaries and may significantly shorten the bleeding time and reduce the bleeding volume of a patient. The snake venom thrombin becomes a main choice for clinicians in treatment of hemorrhagic diseases as having the advantages of being effective, quick-acting, long-effective, convenient, safe, resistant to a thrombin inhibitor and the like. Currently, the snake venom thrombin products on the market in China are mainly originated from Bothrops atrox, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Vipera russelli siamensis and Agkistrodon Halys Pallas. Since the thrombin-like enzyme originated from different snake species is different in structure, differences can be found in the mechanism of action and corresponding pharmacological action, and it is of great significance of establishing a strong-specificity and high-sensitivity method to characterize the source of species and the content for control on the quality of snake venom thrombin products.",
                                "Venom is a complex mixture secreted by poison gland of snakes and contains various proteins, polypeptide, nucleoside, enzymes, metal ions and other small molecules. The venom may be one of the most complicated substances among all poisons in nature, containing trace amount of over 50 kinds of proteolytic enzyme. There is no control on the source of species in the current quality standard of Agkistrodon Halys Pallas venom and no method for specifically detecting a content of thrombin-like enzyme. The currently reported methods for characterizing the content of snake venom thrombin-like enzymes (SVTLEs) mainly include pulsed field gel electrophoresis and an efficacy testing method. Such determination methods are complicated and are poor in accuracy so as not to accurately characterize the mass of the venom. In this regard, establishment of a convenient and rapid qualitative and quantitative method for accurately quantifying the SVTLEs from Agkistrodon Halys Pallas has extensive social benefit and economic effect."
