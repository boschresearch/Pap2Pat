    "abstract": "Babesia microti , an emerging human pathogen, is primarily transmitted through a bite of an infected tick and blood transfusions in human. Stable transfection technique has been reported in many protozoan parasites over the past few years. However, in vivo transient and stable transfection method has not been established for Babesia microti . Here, for the first time, we present a method of transient as well as stable transfection of the Babesia microti (B. microti) in the in vivo conditions. We have identified a novel promoter of B. microti. We also demonstrated that Plasmodium berghei DHFR promoter is recognized and functional in B. microti. We show that BM-CTQ41297 promoter control the expression of two genes, which are present on either side and thus represents a bi-functional promoter in B. microti. The predicted promoter activity values using Promoter 2.0 program is higher for BM- CTQ41297 promoter than strong promoters such as \u03b2-actin, ef-1\u03b2, and many other promoters. Furthermore, we discovered a non-essential locus for the genetic manipulation of the parasite, allowing us to stably integrate foreign genes; GFP , mCherry , into the B. microti. The transfection using an electroporation method and genetic manipulation of B. microti is now achievable and it is possible to obtain transfected viable parasites under in vivo growing conditions. The growth curve analysis of transfected and WT B. microti are similar indicating no defects in the transgenic parasites. This study will enable other researchers in understanding the B. microti biology, host modulation and diverse parasite developmental stages using reverse genetics and holds great potential to identify novel drug targets and vaccine development.",

                "The first case of human babesiosis was identified in 1957 and our understanding of B. microti is still not complete. Babesia is the second most common blood parasite in mammals after trypanosomes1. B. microti is primarily transmitted to human by the bite of an infected tick from genus Ixodes or through blood transfusion. More than 100 species of Babesia parasite have been documented2\u20134, and few of them cause infection in human, namely B. microti, B. divergens, B. duncani or B. venatorum (formerly known as Babesia sp. EU1)5. Human babesiosis results in 6% to 9% of fatality in normal individuals and up to 20% in immunocompromised or elderly, putting a huge economic burden on the human population5. The genetic manipulation of a pathogen represents a potent tool to identify and study the function of important genes for the discovery of new drug and vaccine targets. Genetic manipulation (transfection) of B. microti has not been reported yet owing to the intracellular life stages and complicated life cycle of the parasite. The characterization of a genetically modified parasite will greatly improve our understanding of parasite biology at various developmental stages of its life cycle.",
                "Babesia microti has been suggested to have a new clade in apicomplexan parasites as revealed by the genome-wide phylogenetic analysis6\u20138. Moreover, B. microti is significantly distant from other Babesia and apicomplexan parasites suggesting that the previously established methods of transfection for other species of Babesia such as B. gibsoni9,10, B. bovis11\u201317, B. bigemina11,12, B. ovata18 and apicomplexan parasites may not work for this particular parasite7,8. Furthermore, B. microti parasite has smallest nucleus among all the apicomplexan parasites owing to the impediment of successful transfection of this parasite6. A transient transfection of B. microti in in vitro condition has been reported recently using beta actin promoter driving the expression of a luciferase gene19. Since long-term in vitro culture has not yet been established for B. microti, therefore, this method may not be suitable to perform stable transfection of parasite as mentioned in the published paper. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo growing parasites behave differently in their response to drugs, vaccine, and adaptation.",
                "The transfection system has been established in other apicomplexan parasites such as Theileria annulata20, Toxoplasma gondii21, Cryptosporidium parvum22, T. parva23, Plasmodium falciparum24 and other Plasmodium species (P. berghei, P.yoelii, P.knowlesi). These methods cannot be implicated in B. microti due to its different life stages and its smallest size. Moreover, purification of B. microti via density gradient centrifugation is very challenging, which is a requirement in other methods. In this study, we established an efficient method of stable as well as transient transfection in B. microti growing in in vivo conditions using a combination of reporter gene assays and electroporation approach. Our transfection method has many advantages over a recently reported in vitro transient transfection in B. microti. Expressing a fluorescent marker in the parasite will be advantageous in locating the parasite in a tick vector and host cells."

                        "The success of an efficient transfection method critically depends on the selection of a strong promoter, and a suitable strategy for DNA transfection. We have achieved a first-ever reported stable genetic manipulation of B. microti parasite. We used green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a transfection marker in parasite because of easy identification and visualization of GFP expressing parasites under a fluorescence microscope, followed by isolation using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). First, we identified a BM-CTQ41297 promoter in B. microti parasite (https://protists.ensembl.org). The BM-CTQ41297 promoter primarily controls the transcription of BMR1_03g03485 gene, which encodes for a hypothetical protein named as CTQ41297. The promoter activity values for BM-CTQ41297 promoter is higher (1.07) than other constitutive promoters such as human ef1\u03b1 (0.609), human ef1\u03b2 (0.713), and CMV (0.549) promoters as analyzed by a promoter prediction server 2.0. The value of promoter strength for these promoters is shown in Table 1. B. microti promoter (1969 nucleotides) was further analyzed for a strong promoter activity region using a bioinformatic tool (https://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb). This tool is reliable and it has been used in more than 800 publications. This tool is used to predict a region in the nucleotide sequences, which are predicted to be a promoter sequence. The bioinformatic analysis shows that a nucleotide sequence between 700\u00a0bp and 1300\u00a0bp region of parent 1969 nucleotide sequence may have a strong functional promoter activity. Table 2 describes the parts of BM-CTQ41297 promoters that are predicted to have promoter activities. These analyses show that transcription factors binding site score is higher for the nucleotides 778\u20131200\u00a0bp.Table 1Activity score for various promoters predicted by Promoter 2.0 server.Promoter namePredicted values by Promoter 2.0 serverAccuracy of predictionBM-promoter1.07A score\u2009>\u20091 represents an accuracy of 95% trueHuman ef1\u03b10.609A score of 0.5\u20130.8 have an accuracy of 65% trueHuman ef1\u03b20.713A score of 0.5\u20130.8 have an accuracy of 65% trueCMV promoter0.549A score of 0.5\u20130.8 have an accuracy of 65% trueTable 2Various regions of BM-CTQ41297 that have high transcription factor binding and promoter threshold score (software has an accuracy of 80% true and threshold value is 0.20).BM-CTQ41297 regionsFirst nucleotide of sectionLast nucleotide of sectionPromoter threshold scorea7968338.35b116612035.64c169817335.43d4184574.44e33702.09BM-CTQ41297 regionsPromoter positionPosition of 1st nucleotideTranscription factor binding scoref83377816g83378115h83382115i1,2031,19417j1,203167817k1733167714l1733167817"

                        "An extensive genomic location analysis of BM-CTQ41297 promoter revealed that it is flanked by two genes which are present at each end as shown in Fig.\u00a01A and suggested a possibility of it being a bifunctional promoter. We prepared an episomal construct, in order to check the efficacy of a BM-CTQ41297 promoter to express a reporter gene in B. microti parasite. In control experiments, the B. microti parasites were transfected with an episomal construct without any GFP gene (Fig.\u00a01B) and were GFP negative in fluorescence microscopic analysis (Fig.\u00a01B,C). The test episomal construct contained a BM-CTQ41297 promoter, a gfp gene at downstream region of the promoter and a 3\u2032UTR of BMR1_03g03490 gene. The details of the episomal construct are shown in Fig.\u00a01D. The test episomal construct electroporated parasites were GFP positive as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and shown in Fig.\u00a01E. It confirmed that BM-CTQ41297 promoter could be used to express a reporter gene in B. microti parasite.Figure 1Transient transfection of B. microti parasite.

                        "Next, we used mCherry (a modified version of GFP, which gives red fluorescence) gene at an upstream location of the BM-CTQ41297 promoter in our second test episomal construct for transfection of B. microti parasite (Fig.\u00a01F). We wanted to check if a BM-CTQ41297 promoter could express a reporter gene inserted at the upstream region of the promoter in parasite. The fluorescence microscopic analysis of transfected parasites confirmed that mCherry gene when placed at an upstream of BM-CTQ41297 promoter was expressed in the electroporated parasite as compared to the control (Fig.\u00a01G). Taken together, results confirmed that BM-CTQ41297 promoter can express a foreign gene located either downstream or upstream of the promoter. In a nutshell, we have optimized the conditions to successfully introduce and express reporter genes into B. microti."

We were curious to know whether a BM-CTQ41297 promoter has a bifunctional activity or not. Therefore, we cloned a BM-CTQ41297 promoter in pBSK vector with mCherry and GFP genes on either side along with UTR regions in the same vector as described in Fig.\u00a01H. Parasites transfected with GFP-mCherry dual construct plasmid expressed GFP as well as mCherry markers as confirmed by the fluorescence microscopy (Fig.\u00a01I). Our results confirmed that BM-CTQ41297 promoter has a bidirectional promoter activity and can be used to express two markers simultaneously in B. microti (Fig.\u00a01I). This is a first-ever that a novel bidirectional promoter is identified in B. microti parasite and demonstrated its use. The high efficacy of BM-CTQ41297 could be attributed to its native resident promoter of B. microti, bidirectional activity, and high recognition as well as binding to the transcription factors suggested by bioinformatic analysis (Table 1 & Table 2)."

We hypothesized, that Pb_DHFR promoter might be recognized by transcriptional machinery in B.microti parasite. To test our hypothesis, we prepared a construct that contains a\u2009~\u20092.20\u00a0kb upstream sequence of Pb_ANKA-DHFR promoter and a GFP gene along with\u2009~\u2009600 nucleotides from the 3\u2032UTR of BMR1_03g03490 (Fig.\u00a02B). Twenty-four hours post-electroporation transfected parasites were found to be GFP positive as compared to the control (Fig.\u00a02A,C). Our results confirmed that Pb_DHFR promoter is recognized by B. microti parasites albeit with less efficiency as compared to B. microti BM-CTQ41297 promoter. This indicates that the affinity of transcription factors in B. microti is less for Pb-DHFR promoter. This is also the first report that a promoter from Plasmodium could be used in the B. microti. All the above results strongly suggest that we have optimized and established various conditions for the transient transfection of B. microti parasite that form the foundation of a stable transfection method.Figure 2Plasmodium berghei DHFR promoter is recognized by the B. microti parasite.

We observed that luciferase activity was approximately 6 folds higher in case of BM-CTQ41297 promoter when compared to Pb-DHFR promoter (Fig.\u00a03E).

                        "The genetic manipulation using reverse genetics is a powerful tool to study the function of a gene in the parasite. To perform a stable integration of GFP and mCherry markers in B. microti parasite, we prepared a targeting construct containing a bifunctional BM-CTQ41297 promoter along with GFP and mCherry reporter genes as shown in Fig.\u00a04A. The targeting construct was linearized with SapI restriction enzyme and electroporated into the B. microti parasites. Electroporated parasites were immediately injected into the mice and later on analyzed by the fluorescence microscopy, Southern blot and diagnostic PCR methods. Clonal population of transgenic parasite was analyzed by diagnostic PCR and Southern blot analysis. The diagnostic PCR, as well as Southern blot analysis, confirmed the integration of reporter genes at the right locus in the parasite genome (Fig.\u00a04B,C). In the diagnostic PCRs, P21 and P22 represent the primers (Table 3) used to show successful 5\u2032 integration, and similarly, P23 and P24 (Table 3) represent the primer pair that was used to demonstrate 3\u2032 integration. The diagnostic PCR results confirm the integration of reporter genes in the B. microti parasite at right locus by showing PCR products of expected sizes (Fig.\u00a04B). A Southern Blot analysis of wild type (WT) and transgenic B. microti parasite genomic DNA (gDNA) detected the expected band size of\u2009~\u200910.5\u00a0kb from the transgenic parasite using a GFP probe, but not in the in the WT parasite gDNA, which does not contain the GFP (Fig.\u00a04C). Moreover, as shown in the Fig.\u00a04D expression of both GFP as well as mCherry proteins was observed in the same parasite, which suggested a stable transfection in B. microti parasite. We did not incorporate any drug selection marker, therefore, we used a fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort the GFP and mCherry positive parasites.Figure 4Stable transfection of the B. microti parasite.

                "Babesia microti is an emerging Apicomplexan parasite that causes babesiosis in human and transmitted through the bite of an infected tick that belongs to the genus Ixodus. B. microti parasite can also be transmitted through the blood transfusion as asymptomatic blood donor can donate blood, and thus represent a vital problem for the military hospitals and blood bank25. It has been suggested that B. microti can be transmitted to a developing fetus in an infected pregnant woman and may have severe consequences26. Babesiosis cases in humans are increasing with time and represent a serious threat to the human population. Furthermore, a coinfection of B. microti and Borrelia in humans, represent a severe health issue27,28. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new tools to prevent new infection and transmission of parasite. More specifically, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient method of transfection for genetic manipulation particularly in B. microti. The genetic manipulation of a microorganism represents a valuable tool to study the function of a gene at different developmental stages in the parasite life cycle, identification of novel targets for drug discovery and vaccine development. A GFP expressing parasite is advantageous for the drug screening and in vivo tracking of the parasite location during infection. Studies have shown that transfection in B. bovis, to study the gene function, were helpful in developing vaccine against bovine babesiosis29,30. Therefore, a transgenic B. microti parasite will also be helpful in study of gene function and vaccine development. A recently published in vitro transient transfection is not feasible for the in vivo growing B. microti parasite as described by the author. The different adaptations of in vitro and in vivo growing parasites respond differently to the drugs, and other therapeutics. Moreover, continuous in-vitro growing parasite loses their capacity of transmission through the tick vector. Furthermore, a continuous in vitro culture for long-term has not yet been developed for B. microti, therefore, there was an urgent need to identify a new method of transfection that can be used in in vivo conditions. The establishment of a transfection method in B. microti parasite has opened several research areas of intense interest to investigate various research problems including identification of the critical genes associated with a parasite life stages, tick-parasite interactions, comprehensive analysis of sporogonic cycle, and host-parasite interactions. We have established for the first-time a successful method of in vivo transient and stable transfection in B. microti parasite by expressing GFP and mCherry reporter genes under the control of a novel promoter. First, we identified right promoters and checked their efficacy in the expression of reporter genes in B. microti. Next, we established a method for the transient as well as stable transfection in the parasite using constructs containing the selected promoter.",
                "We identified sets of promoters that can be used in the transfection of B. microti parasite. We identified and characterized a BM-CTQ41297 promoter in B. microti parasite. This promoter is located on the chromosome-III. The bioinformatic analysis of BM-CTQ41297 has identified several regions listed in Table 1 which may engage with transcription factors and in RNA polymerase recognition that might lead to strong promoter activity. Genomic location of this promoter is very unique in presence of two genes at each end of the promoter. Our result shows that the BM-CTQ41297 promoter is a bidirectional promoter and can express two proteins simultaneously. A bidirectional promoter is advantageous in several ways such as expression of two reporter genes, one at either end of the promoter. In another scenario, a bidirectional promoter can be used to express a reporter and a drug selection marker.",
                "The 2A self-cleaving peptide (2A) is an oligopeptide (usually 19\u201322 amino acids) located between two proteins in some members of the picornavirus family31. The 2A self-cleaving peptide of FMDV might undergo self-cleavage to generate mature viral proteins by a translational effect that is known as \u201cstop\u2013go\u201d or \u201cstop-carry\u201d. The cleavage site is located between the last glycine of its C-terminal and the first proline of the 2B downstream protein. Porcine teschovirus-1, 2A (P2A-GSG) exhibits the highest cleavage efficiency. Using P2A-GSG peptide, a B. microti bifunctional promoter could be used to express 3 or 4 different reporter genes or a combination of drug makers and reporter genes32.",
                "We used BM-CTQ41297 promoter for a first ever developed stable transfection method in the B. microti parasite. Moreover, a DHFR promoter from the other Apicomplexan species, the Plasmodium berghei was tested in this study and found to be recognized in the B. microti parasite with lesser efficiency as compared to the BM-CTQ41297 promoter. Furthermore, the optimal expression of GFP gene with Pb-DHFR promoter was observed at 4\u00a0days post-transfection, which indicates a weak recognition of a heterologous promoter. Our results also suggested that the transcriptional machinery in B. microti could recognize a foreign promoter from other Apicomplexan parasite such as Plasmodium. These results also hint at the existence of some common transcription machineries in these two parasites and a possibility of a common drug target.",
                "This is the first time a novel bidirectional promoter in B. microti parasite have been identified by us and used it for the establishment of a transfection procedure in the parasite. After the establishment of appropriate conditions for the transient transfection in B. microti parasite, we performed a stable transfection of the parasite using double homologous recombination method. Our results demonstrated that we have identified right conditions to achieve a stable transfection of the B. microti. We also found a genomic locus for the genetic manipulation of the parasite, which is located in the inter-genic region of BMR1_01G01280 and BMR1_01G01285 genes. This locus can be used to integrate any foreign gene into B. microti parasite without affecting the parasite growth. An insertion of a foreign gene at this locus did not affect the parasite life cycle and transgenic parasites were similar in growth as compared to the parental parasite.",
                "The development of an efficient transfection method in B. microti will springboard the foundation of new drug discovery for the babesiosis treatment. The transfection procedure can be implemented in unraveling the function of various genes including transcription factors, metabolic genes, promoters, kinases, ion channels, housekeeping and apicoplast genes by reverse genetics using gene knockout study to identify novel drug candidates. The transfection method established here can be employed to knockout a particular gene from the genome of B. microti followed by the phenotypic analysis of knock out parasite to identify new drug targets. The GFP/mCherry expressing parasite is very useful in screening of antiparasitic compounds by using FACS to determine parasitemia, parasite invasion and replication after drug treatment. Plasmodium expressing a reporter gene has been used in high throughput drug screening previously33 suggesting the applications of current transfection procedure. The transfection methods have been used to develop genetically attenuated parasite (GAP) vaccines in the Plasmodium indicating another potential application of an efficient transfection method in developing a vaccine34,35. A GFP expressing parasite can be easily imaged by microscopy after the drug treatment will lead to a potential screening of compounds and eliminate the antibody staining to identify parasites after drug administration. A luciferase-expressing parasite has been used in drug screening under in vitro as well as in in vivo conditions36.",
                "Transfection method developed by us will be very useful to characterize the unidentified stages of the parasite life cycle in tick stage. Moreover, our study will be useful for identifying novel drug and vaccine targets. Furthermore, our study has applications in generating a live attenuated parasite vaccine though the genetic engineering of the parasite. There are many other Apicomplexan parasites where a stable transfection method is lacking. Taking clues from our findings, we anticipate that transfection of other parasite can be achieved through a right combination of promoter, fluorescent markers and efficient electroporation method."

The parasitemia of injected mice was observed every day and mice were sacrificed when parasitemia reached to\u2009~\u200910%."

                                "Genomic DNA of the transfected clonal parasites was isolated by blood Mini kit for gDNA isolation (Qiagen, Germany). Integration specific diagnostic PCR was performed for 5\u2032 integration events using primers P21 and P22. Similarly, 3\u2032 integration specific diagnostic PCR was performed using p23 and P24 primers. These pairs of primers will give PCR product only on the integrant gDNA and not in wild type (WT) gDNA. The size of the expected PCR product was 1.3\u00a0kb for the 5\u2032 integration site and 1.5\u00a0kb for the 3\u2032 integration site. To further confirm integration, a Southern blot was performed to determine the integration of the reporter genes at the right locus in the parasite. Briefly, the gDNA of the transgenic and WT parasite was digested with Eag-I restriction enzyme overnight and the resulting DNA fragments were separated using a 0.8% agarose gel run at a 50\u00a0V. The DNA was then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane and cross-linked with UV. The membrane was incubated for about 3\u20134\u00a0h in a pre-hybridization buffer at 50 degree Celsius in a hybridization chamber. The membrane with DNA was further processed for hybridization with a DIG labeled GFP probe at 50 degree Celsius for 12\u00a0h. The membrane was washed three times with an appropriate washing buffer that removes non-specifically bound probe but leaves the DNA-bound probe. An anti-DIG antibody was used at 1:5,000 dilutions to detect the probe. The blot was developed using the CSPD substrate, which is a chemi-luminescence substrate. A band of 10.5-kb is expected\u00a0in transgenic parasite by the GFP probe. The probe was amplified by PCR using primers P3 and P4 and labeled using a DIG-labeling kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland,), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol."

                        "A growth curve analysis of the transgenic parasites (B. microti-GFP-mCherry) was performed by blood-stage parasitemia examination over 8\u20139\u00a0days. The mice were injected with 10,000 transgenic or WT parasites in a group of 10 mice each. Parasitemia were determined for both the wildtype (WT) and the transfected parasites. The blood-stage parasitemia was determined by the Giemsa method. In this method, first a thin smear of blood is made on the glass slide, fixed with methanol and then stained with Giemsa stain for about 15\u00a0min. The parasite numbers, in the blood of infected mice, were determined by bright field 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009objective microscope. Parasitemia was measured daily. The pre-patent period, i.e. the first appearance of the parasite in the blood of infected mice, was determined in case of WT and transgenic parasites."
