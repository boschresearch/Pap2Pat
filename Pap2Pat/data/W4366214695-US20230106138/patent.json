                        "According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) healthcare-associated infection (HAI) prevalence survey conducted during the year 2015, it was estimated that there were around 110,800 surgical site infections (SSIs) associated with inpatient surgeries. SSI is a type of healthcare-associated infection in which a surgical incision site may be infected after a surgical procedure. SSI is a common surgical complication occurring in about 3% of all surgical procedures and in up to 20% of patients undergoing emergency intra-abdominal procedures. Further, the SSIs may result in substantial morbidity due to which the patient has to stay in hospital for prolonged period. Also, treatment of such SSIs is very expensive. All of these factors have a substantial impact on patients and hospitals and create a huge economic burden on any given healthcare system. Therefore, minimizing the SSIs is a top priority for the surgeons and the hospitals to ensure safest environment for the patients undergoing surgery. Further, identifying the SSIs at its early stage plays a crucial role. Early identification of the SSIs allow surgeons to intervene early and remediate developing the SSIs in most efficient manner. Conventionally, the surgeons rely on physical observation of surgical wound to detect the SSIs. However, such detection of the SSIs through physical observation of the surgical wound is difficult before suppuration. Hence, there is a high likelihood that the SSIs may still be present and the surgeon may have failed to detect such SSIs. Thus, such conventional mechanism to detect the SSIs is prone to human errors, less reliable and causes significant time delay.",

Furthermore, the one or more wearable devices 104 may also process the primary physiological signals by using signal processing techniques in order to extract the derived physiological signals. Thus, even if there is no internet connectivity, the one or more wearable devices 104 may generate one or more alerts based on the derived physiological signals and output the generated one or more alerts to the one or more healthcare providers. For example, when heartrate of the patient is below a predefined threshold, one or more alerts corresponding to the heartrate of the patient is generated and the generated one or more alerts may be outputted to the one or more healthcare providers.",
