    "abstract": "Most saliency estimation methods aim to explicitly model low-level conspicuity cues such as edges or blobs and may additionally incorporate top-down cues using face or text detection. Data-driven methods for training saliency models using eye-fixation data are increasingly popular, particularly with the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep architectures. However, current methods in this latter paradigm use loss functions designed for classification or regression tasks whereas saliency estimation is evaluated on topographical maps. In this work, we introduce a new saliency map model which formulates a map as a generalized Bernoulli distribution. We then train a deep architecture to predict such maps using novel loss functions which pair the softmax activation function with measures designed to compute distances between probability distributions. We show in extensive experiments the effectiveness of such loss functions over standard ones on four public benchmark datasets, and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art saliency methods.",

                "This work is concerned with visual attention prediction, specifically, predicting a topographical visual saliency map when given an input image. Visual attention has been traditionally used in computer vision as a pre-processing step in order to focus subsequent processing on regions of interest in images, an ever-more important step as vision models and datasets increase in size. Saliency map prediction has found useful applications in tasks such as automatic image cropping [39], content aware image resizing [1], image thumb-nailing [29], object recognition [7], and finegrained scene, and human action classification [36]. Traditional saliency models, such as the seminal work of Itti et al. [14], have focused on designing mechanisms to explicitly model biological systems. Another popular attention mod- elling paradigm involves using data-driven approaches to learn patch-level classifiers which give a local image patch a \"saliency score\" [19,18], using eye-fixation data to derive training labels. A recent trend has emerged which intersects with both of these paradigms: to use hierarchical models to extract saliency maps, with model weights being learned in a supervised manner. In particular, end-to-end or \"deep\" architectures, which have been successfully used in semantic labelling tasks such as categorization or object localization, have been re-purposed as attention models [23,33]. This trend has been facilitated by the introduction of large visual attention datasets created using novel eye movement collection paradigms [16,43]. However, while these deep methods have focused on designing appropriate architectures for extracting saliency maps, they continue to use loss functions adapted for semantic tasks, such as classification or regression losses.",
                "In this work, we propose a novel formulation of saliency map prediction as a probability distribution prediction task. The map is formulated as a generalized Bernoulli distribution, and several novel loss functions are proposed based on probability distance measures. We show that training a deep architecture with such loss functions results in superior performance with respect to standard regression loss functions such as the Euclidean and Huber loss. We also perform a comparison among our proposed loss functions and show that our loss function, based on the Bhattacharyya distance for multinomial distributions, gives top performance.",

We will discuss each of these broad categories in turn. For an excellent survey of saliency estimation methods, please refer to [2].",
                "Unsupervised shallow methods Most early work on saliency builds on psychological and psychophysical models of attention as studied in humans. Koch and Ullman [20] were among the first to use feature integration theory [40] to propose a set of individual topographical maps of elementary cues such as color, contrast, and motion, and combine them to produce a global topographical map of saliency. Their model is implemented using a simple neural circuitry with winner-take-all and inhibition-of-return mechanisms. It is further investigated in [13] by combining features maps over a wider set of modalities (42 such maps) and testing on real-world images. Later approaches largely explore the same idea of complementary feature ensembles [14,41,26,24,45,32] and often add to it additional center-surround cues [14,31,45].",
                "Complementing the biologically motivated approaches, a number of methods adopt an information-theoretic justification for attentional selection, e.g. by self-information [46], information maximization [4], or Bayesian surprise [12]. High computational efficiency is achieved by spectrum-based methods [10,35]. All these approaches use bottom-up cues, are shallow (one or few layers) and involve no or minimalistic learning of thresholds/heuristics."

Learning, in their case, has meant finding the optimal linear combination of features from the different network layers."

Our work lies in this category and involves training an end-toend deep model with a novel loss function. SALICON [16] was collected with a new data-collection paradigm, in which observers were shown foveated images and were asked to move the mouse cursor around to simulate the high-resolution fovea. This novel paradigm was used to annotate 20K images from the MSCOCO dataset [25]. Relying on this new large-scale dataset, the authors of [33] trained a network end-to-end for saliency prediction. Their network, titled JuntingNet, consists of five convolutional and two fully-connected layers, and the parameters of the network are learned by minimizing the Euclidean loss function defined on the ground-truth saliency maps. This method reports state-of-the-art results on the LSUN 2015 saliency prediction challenge [47].",

DeepFix builds upon the very deep VGGNet [38], uses convolutional layers with large and multi-size receptive fields to capture complementary image context, and introduces a location-biased convolutional (LBC) layer to model the center-bias.",
                "Finally, one of the most recent works in this paradigm [11] proposes the use of deep neural networks to bridge the semantic gap in saliency prediction via a two-pronged strategy. The first is the use of the KL-divergence as a loss function motivated by the fact that it is a standard metric for evaluation of saliency methods. The second is the aggregation of response maps from both coarse and fine resolutions.",

As we discuss in section 4, we observe that our Bhattacharyya distance-based loss function consistently outperforms the KL-divergence-based one across 4 standard saliency metrics."

More recently, methods have sought to directly predict maps using pixel-wise regression.",
                "However, visual attention is a fundamentally stochastic process due to it being a perceptual and therefore subjective phenomenon. In an analysis of 300 images viewed by 39 observers, the authors of [17] find that the fixations for a set of n observers match those from a different set of n observers with an AUC score that increases with the increase in the value of n. The lower bound of human performance is found to be 85% AUC. Therefore there is high consistency across observers. At the limit of n \u2192 \u221e this AUC score is 92%, which can therefore be considered a realistic upper-bound for saliency estimation performance.",
                "Ground-truth saliency maps are constructed from the aggregated fixations of multiple observers, ignoring any temporal fixation information. Areas with a high fixation density are interpreted as receiving more attention. As attention is thought to be given to a localized region rather than an exact pixel, two-dimensional Gaussian filtering is typically applied to a binary fixation map to construct a smooth \"attentional landscape\" [44] (c.f . Figure 1, middle image for an example). Our goal is to predict this attentional landscape, or saliency map. Given the stochastic nature of the fixations upon which the maps are based, and the fact that the maps are based on aggregated fixations without temporal information, we propose to model a saliency map as a probability distribution over pixels, where each value corresponds to the probability of that pixel being fixated upon. That is, we represent a saliency map as a generalized Bernoulli dis-",

While this formulation is somewhat simplistic, it will allow for novel loss functions highly amenable to training deep models with back-propagation. In the sequel, we first describe these loss functions and then describe our model implementation."

We use the convolutional layers of the VGGNet model [38], which were trained on ImageNet images for the task of classification, as the early layers of our model. This convolution sub-network has been shown to provide good local feature maps for a variety of different tasks including object localization [34] and semantic segmentation [27]. As saliency datasets tend to be much too small to train such large networks from random initializations (the largest dataset has 15000 images, compared to 1M for ImageNet), it is essential to initialize with a pretrained network. We then progressively decrease the number of feature maps using additional convolutional layers, until a final down-sampled saliency map is produced. We add three new layers, rather than just one, to predict the final map in order to improve both discriminability and generalizability [38]. We experimented with different filter sizes besides 7 \u00d7 7 (e.g. 9 \u00d7 9, 5 \u00d7 5, 3 \u00d7 3) and found no significant performance difference. We explicitly avoided fullyconnected layers in order to obtain a memory and timeefficient model. The three new layers are initialised with a uniform Gaussian distribution of sigma = 0.01. Because the response maps undergo several max-pooling operations, the predicted saliency map p p p is lower-resolution than the input image. The ground-truth map g g g is therefore downsampled during training to match the dimensions of p p p. Conversely, during inference the predicted map is upsampled with a bilinear filter to match the dimensions of the input image (see Figure 2), and the softmax function is applied for normalization to a probability distribution.",

We tested this by adding Gaussian blurring and a center-bias to our maps, with optimized parameters, using the post-processing code of the MIT saliency benchmark [5]. We found no consistent improvement across different metrics using this post-processing which indicates that a great deal of center-bias and Gaussian blurring is already accounted for in the model.",

To reduce training time, the first 4 convolutional layers were fixed and thus retained their pretrained values. We used a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0005. The model is implemented in Caffe [15]. We trained the network using an Nvidia K40 GPU. Training on the SALICON training set took 30 hours.",

For this reason, we perform dataset-specific fine-tuning, which improves performance. Fine-tuning is particularly essential in our case because the SALICON dataset collected mouse clicks in lieu of actual eye-fixations which, while highly correlated in general, are still an approximation to true human eye movements. As shown on a subset of the SALICON images, image-level conformance between SALICON fixations and human eye fixations can be as low as shuffled AUC (sAUC) of 0.655 and as high as sAUC of 0.965 [16]. Therefore it is beneficial to fine-tune the network for each dataset of interest. A detailed description of each of these datasets follows."

The attentional focus (foveation) in the human attention mechanism that defines saliency fixations is simulated using mouse-movements over a blurred image. The approximate foveal image region around the mouse position is selectively un-blurred as the user explores the image scene using the mouse cursor. As evaluated on a subset of the dataset, this mouse-click data is in general highly consistent with human eye fixations (at 0.89 sAUC).

We outperform all published results, to our knowledge, on this dataset across all three metrics.",

Note that DeepFix [22] incorporates external cues such as center and horizon biases in its models. We believe that including such cues may also improve our model. In addition, they use a larger architecture, but train with a regression loss. Therefore our approach may complement theirs. Fine-tuning on MIT-1003 could only be performed using a batch size of 1 image due to the large variations in size and aspect ratio of the images. We observed that a much-reduced momentum of 0.70 improved stability and "

We used our final SALICON-trained model to predict maps for test images both before and after fine-tuning the model on training images from VOCA-2012. The results summarized in Table 6 show that our method, both with and without finetuning, outperforms the state-of-the-art [30]. This suggests that the task-dependent fixations for this action recognition dataset are highly consistent with free-viewing fixations."

First, attention is competitive as we look at certain regions in the image at the expense of others. Hence, the fixation map normalised over the total visual stimulus can be understood as a spatial probability distribution. Secondly, a probabilistic framework allows the model to account for the noise across subjects and over the data collection paradigm.",

One can see that center-surround contrast cues are learned very quickly, after having seen fewer than 50 images. Faces (both of animate and non-animate objects) are also learned quickly, having seen fewer than 100 images. The saliency of text also emerges fairly rapidly. However, the cue is not as strongly identified, likely due to the relatively smaller amount of training data involving text. "

We train a deep network using an objective function which penalizes the distance between target and predicted maps in the form of probability distributions. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method with respect to other loss functions and other state-of-the-art saliency estimation methods. They also illustrate the benefit of using suitable learning criteria adapted to this task."
