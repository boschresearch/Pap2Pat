    "abstract": "A method for generating a system for predicting saliency in an image and method of use of the prediction system are described. Attention maps for each of a set of training images are used to train the system. The training includes passing the training images though a neural network and optimizing an objective function over the training set which is based on a distance measure computed between a first probability distribution computed for a saliency map output by the neural network and a second probability distribution computed for the attention map for the respective training image. The trained neural network is suited to generation of saliency maps for new images.",

                        "Visual attention has been often used in computer vision as a pre-processing step in order to focus subsequent processing on regions of interest in images. This has proved particularly useful as vision models and datasets increase in size. Saliency map prediction finds application in tasks such as automatic image cropping (Stentiford, F., \u201cAttention based auto image cropping,\u201d 5th Intl Conf. on Computer Vision Systems, pp. 1-9, 2007) and content aware image resizing (Achanta, R., et al., \u201cSaliency detection for content-aware image resizing,\u201d 16th IEEE Intl Conf. on Image Processing (ICIP), pp. 1001-1004, 2009), image thumb-nailing (Marchesotti, L., et al., \u201cA framework for visual saliency detection with applications to image thumbnailing,\u201d ICCV, pp. 2232-2239, 2009), object recognition (Gilani, S., et al., \u201cPET: an eye-tracking dataset for animal-centric Pascal object classes,\u201d 2015 IEEE Int'l Conf. on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), pp. 1-6, 2015), and fine-grained, scene, and human action classification (Sharma, G., et al., \u201cDiscriminative spatial saliency for image classification,\u201d CVPR, pp. 3506-3513, 2012).",
                        "Some traditional saliency detection methods have focused on designing models that explicitly model biological systems (Itti, L, et al., \u201cA model of saliency-based visual attention for rapid scene analysis,\u201d TPAMI, (11):1254-1259, 1998). Others have used data-driven approaches to learn patch-level classifiers which give a local image patch a \u201csaliency score,\u201d using eye-fixation data to derive training labels (Kienzle, W., et al., \u201cA Nonparametric Approach to Bottom-Up Visual Saliency,\u201d NIPS, pp. 405-414, 2007; Judd, T., et al., \u201cLearning to predict where humans look. CVPR, pp. 2106-2113, 2009, hereinafter, \u201cJudd 2009\u201d). Hierarchical models have also been used to extract saliency maps, with model weights being learned in a supervised manner. Recently, neural network architectures developed for semantic annotation tasks such as categorization and object localization have been adapted to use as attentional models (K\u00fcimmerer, M., et al., \u201cDeep Gaze I: Boosting Saliency Prediction with Feature Maps Trained on ImageNet,\u201d ICLR Workshop, arXiv:1411.1045, pp. 1-12, 2015; and Pan, J., et al., \u201cEnd-to-end Convolutional Network for Saliency Prediction,\u201d Technical report, arXiv:1507.01422, pp. 1-6, 2015). This approach has benefitted from the availability of large visual attention datasets (Jiang, M., et al., \u201cSALICON: Saliency in Context,\u201d CVPR, pp. 1072-1080, 2015, hereinafter, \u201cJiang 2015\u201d; and Xu, P., et al., \u201cTurkerGaze: Crowdsourcing Saliency with Webcam based Eye Tracking,\u201d Technical report, arXiv:1504.06755v1, pp. 1-9, 2015). These deep methods, however, have used loss functions more suited to semantic tasks, such as classification or regression losses."

Area under the curve is measured as the area under a plot of true positives (y axis) vs false positives (x axis, and thus higher values indicate better performance). The lower bound of human performance was found to be 85% AUC. Therefore there appears to be a high consistency across observers. At the limit of n\u2192\u221e, the AUC score is 92%, which can therefore be considered a realistic upper-bound for saliency estimation performance.",

Areas with a high fixation density are interpreted as receiving more attention. As attention is thought to be given to a localized region rather than an exact pixel, two-dimensional Gaussian filtering can be applied to a binary fixation map to construct a smooth saliency map.

For example, the saliency map can be used to identify pixels of the image having at least a threshold predicted saliency. A region 68 containing these pixels (optionally enlarged to create a regular shape such as a bounding box or otherwise extended in one or both dimensions) may be labeled as a salient region and information extracted therefrom.",

These and other applications can benefit from an improved region-of-interest locator that focuses the costly high-level visual processing on the relevant scene locations. The method is less computationally expensive (once the neural network has been learned) than many existing methods, which is particularly advantageous when a large number of images need to be processed in a relatively short time period.",

Especially in video analytics tasks, where adding another spatio-temporal dimension greatly increases the number of pixels that need to be processed, such a selective processing is very useful. Video-based vehicle occupancy estimation, parking management, patient monitoring in healthcare, and client tracking and waiting time estimation in retail can all benefit from the detection of salient regions.",

These layers were trained on ImageNet images for the task of classification. This convolution sub-network has been shown to provide good local feature maps for a variety of different tasks including object localization and semantic segmentation. As saliency datasets tend to be too small to train such large networks from random initializations (the largest publically available dataset has 15,000 images, compared to 1M for ImageNet), it is useful to initialize with such a pre-trained network, even though the task is different. The remaining three layers are initialized with a uniform Gaussian distribution of sigma=0.01. The number of feature maps is progressively decreased using additional convolutional layers, until a final down-sampled saliency map is produced. The final fully-convolutional network comprises 16 convolutional layers, each of which is followed by a ReLu layer.",

To reduce training time, the first four convolutional layers of the VGG network were not trained and retained their pre-trained values. A momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0005 were used. The model is implemented in Gaffe (Jia, Y., et al., \u201cGaffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding,\u201d Proc. ACM Int'l Conf. on Multimedia, pp. 675-678, 2014). The network was trained using an Nvidia K40 GPU. Training on the SALICON dataset took 30 hours.",

In addition, the SALICON dataset collected mouse-click in lieu of actual eye-fixations, leading to a domain shift. Therefore it would be beneficial to fine-tune the network for each dataset of interest, or at least for actual eye-fixation data. However all public eye-fixation datasets, such as MIT-1003 and MIT-300, described below, have a limited number of images, ranging from 300 to 2000. Accordingly a limited fine-tuning was performed with the public eye-fixation datasets, which appears to adjust the weights to equalize the histograms between predicted and ground-truth maps better. A detailed description of each of these datasets follows."

The fixation data for the test set is held-out and performance on it is evaluated on a remote server. The SALICON dataset relies on cursor clicks on the objects of interest for fixation gathering.

                                "Table 3 shows results for some of the other methods and the present method (PDP) without fine tuning. PDP outperforms published results on this dataset across all three metrics.",

It should be noted that the DeepFix method of Kruthiventi 2015 incorporates external cues, such as center and horizon biases in their models. Including such cues may also improve the present model 64. In addition, Kruthiventi 2015 uses a larger architecture, trained with a regression loss. The fine-tuning on the MIT-1003 dataset could not be done in a batch mode due to the variable image sizes. It was observed that a much reduced momentum of 0.70 boosted the stability and smooth learning of the model.",

Table 5 shows that PDP gives the highest score of sAUC. This dataset contains variety in terms of the aesthetic images collected online in addition to the natural images of indoor and outdoor scenes. Using a small set of only 500 images, the model can swiftly adapt to the new data.",

The present method consistently gives high fixation probabilities to areas of high center-surround contrast, and also to high-level cues such as bodies, faces and, to a lesser extent, text. This is likely due to the large number of images containing people and faces in the SALICON dataset.",
                                "GT stands for the ground-truth saliency maps. Note that the PDP results shown here were obtained from a network that was trained only on SALICON images, with no fine-tuning to this dataset.",

It can see that center-surround contrast cues are learned very quickly, after having seen fewer than 50 images. Faces (both of animate and non-animate objects) are also learned quickly, having seen fewer than 100 images. Text is also learned fairly quickly. However, the cue is not as strongly identified, likely due to the relatively smaller amount of training data involving text.",
