    "title": "A functional subset of CD8+ T cells during chronic exhaustion is defined by SIRP\u03b1 expression",
    "date": "2019-02-15",
    "abstract": "Prolonged exposure of CD8+ T cells to antigenic stimulation, as in chronic viral infections, leads to a state of diminished function termed exhaustion. We now demonstrate that even during exhaustion there is a subset of functional CD8+ T cells defined by surface expression of SIRP\u03b1, a protein not previously reported on lymphocytes. On SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells, expression of co-inhibitory receptors is counterbalanced by expression of co-stimulatory receptors and it is only SIRP\u03b1+ cells that actively proliferate, transcribe IFN\u03b3 and show cytolytic activity. Furthermore, target cells that express the ligand for SIRP\u03b1, CD47, are more susceptible to CD8+ T cell-killing in vivo. SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells are evident in mice infected with Friend retrovirus, LCMV Clone 13, and in patients with chronic HCV infections. Furthermore, therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 to reinvigorate CD8+ T cells during chronic infection expands the cytotoxic subset of SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells.",

                "Key effectors in host immune responses to intracellular pathogens are CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). CTLs become activated in a pathogen-specific manner, undergo extensive expansion, and function to locate and kill infected cells. While the destructive capacity of CTLs is essential for their activity, it also provides the potential to cause immunopathological damage1. Thus the immune system has evolved multilayered mechanisms to control the duration and magnitude of CTL responses. For example, the contraction of the CD8+ T cell response is hardwired and not dependent on pathogen clearance2. Thus, even in circumstances where a virus is not cleared, the CTL population nevertheless contracts. Furthermore, prolonged antigenic stimulation during chronic infections causes a diminished state of T cell function known as exhaustion3,4. Such dysfunction not only protects the host from immunopathology but also contributes to the failure to clear infections5,6.",
                "T cell exhaustion was first discovered in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)3,7, but it is now known to also occur in humans chronically infected with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)8. Exhausted CD8+ T cells have increased expression of co-inhibitory receptors whose breadth and level of expression have been correlated with dysfunction9. Thus high expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors is considered a cardinal feature of exhausted CD8+ T cells6. Blockade of one of these, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), increases the function of exhausted CD8+ T cells10,11. Cells with intermediate rather than high expression levels of PD-1 have been reported to comprise a subset of less exhausted cells whose function can be rescued by PD-1 blockade12. Furthermore, simultaneous blockade of more than one co-inhibitory receptor (e.g., PD-1 and LAG-39 or PD-1 and TIM-313) has a much more potent effect on enhancing CD8+ T cell function than blockade of a single receptor. Thus the state of CD8+ T cell exhaustion is reversible14 and evidence indicates that not all CD8+ T cells become exhausted. Despite their reduced function, exhausted T cells are not uniformly inert and help maintain control over virus replication during chronic infection15.",
                "In this study we examine the expression of a novel cell surface marker, signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1), expressed on exhausted CD8+ T cells during chronic infection of mice with Friend virus (FV), a naturally occurring retrovirus of mice16. Like other chronic viral infections, chronic FV is associated with exhausted CD8+ T cells because of sustained antigenic stimulation and suppression by regulatory T cells17,18. To identify cell surface markers that might be useful for the identification and therapeutic targeting of unique CD8+ T cell subsets, we analyzed a publicly available microarray database from CD8+ T cells isolated from mice chronically infected with LCMV Clone 13 (Cl13)19 looking for transcripts that showed similar expression patterns to the co-inhibitory receptor, PD-1. Interestingly, we found that the expression pattern of SIRP\u03b1 closely followed that of PD-1.",
                "SIRP\u03b1 (SHPS-1, CD172a)20 is an inhibitory receptor whose expression was previously thought to be limited to myeloid cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and neurons21. The binding of macrophage SIRP\u03b1 to its widely expressed ligand, CD47, induces an inhibitory signal for phagocytosis, a \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal21 that prevents the phagocytosis of healthy cells. Mice with genetic inactivation or mutation of SIRP\u03b1 have numerous abnormalities, including impairment of phagocyte migration22, dendritic cell (DCs) homeostasis23, bone cell differentiation24, kidney function25, and interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production26. Phagocytes from SIRP\u03b1 mutant mice also have enhanced respiratory bursts27. Cancer cells upregulate CD47 to evade macrophage clearance by inhibiting phagocytosis28,29. Positive roles for SIRP\u03b1 have also been described including a mechanistic role in the fusion machinery of macrophages30 and the binding of antigen-presenting cells to bovine CD4+ T cells during priming31.",
                "Unexpectedly, we found that SIRP\u03b1 expression was inducible on a subset of CD8+ T cells during immune activation and that its expression was coincident with PD-1 expression but more limited. Based on its role as a co-inhibitory receptor on macrophages and its expression on PD-1hi CD8+ T cells, we expected that SIRP\u03b1 might play an inhibitory role in exhausted T cells. Indeed, the SIRP\u03b1+ subset had high expression of inhibitory molecules, but this was counter-balanced by high expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Furthermore, the SIRP\u03b1+ subset had high levels of cytotoxic granules, displayed evidence of recent cytolytic activity (CD107a+), and were more cytotoxic ex vivo than the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset. In vivo CTL experiments indicated that SIRP\u03b1 interactions with CD47 were important for optimal cytolytic activity. Thus SIRP\u03b1 marks the subset of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells that retains antiviral activity during chronic FV infection."

                        "To identify cell surface markers that could mark\u00a0unique subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells, an analysis of publicly available microarray data was performed on T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells that had been adoptively transferred into wild-type (WT) mice infected with either the Armstrong (Arm) strain of LCMV (causes only acute infections) or the Cl13 strain (progresses to chronic infections)19. We identified Sirp\u03b1 as a gene of interest because it showed an expression pattern similar to PD-1 over time and had sustained upregulation during Cl13 chronic infection compared to more transient expression with Arm infection (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Twenty thousand seven hundred and seventy-six genes were analyzed for correlated expression with Pdcd1 and Sirp\u03b1 ranked in the 97th percentile during acute and chronic infection (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Sirp\u03b1 was of special interest because it had been shown to be important in innate immunity but was not known to be expressed on CD8+ T cells or other adaptive immune cells. Furthermore, the sustained expression of Sirp\u03b1 on CD8+ T cells late after infection with Cl13 suggested that it might identify an interesting subset of cells during exhaustion. Protein expression was verified by flow cytometry on LCMV-specific, transgenic CD8+ T cells at 42 days post-infection when CD8+ T cell responses to Arm would have contracted but responses to Cl13 would be largely exhausted and express PD-1. Over 90% of the transgenic CD8+ T cells remaining after Arm infection were PD-1 low and SIRP\u03b1\u2212 (Fig.\u00a01c). In contrast, over 95% of the transgenic CD8+ T cells remaining after Cl13 infection were PD-1 high and a significant subset expressed SIRP\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a01d). The mean fluorescence intensity of SIRP\u03b1 expression was significantly higher on the CD8+ T cells responding to the chronic Cl13 strain compared to acute Arm (Fig.\u00a01e).Fig. 1Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) expression on CD8+ T cells during acute and chronic infection. Wild-type C57/BL6 mice were adoptively transferred with 1000 T cell receptor transgenic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific CD8+ T cells from the spleens of naive P14 mice and then infected with either LCMV Arm or Cl13. The cells were then analyzed at multiple time points by microarray and the data were made publicly available19. SIRP\u03b1 (a) and PD-1 (b) expression were analyzed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test with each time point compared to time zero (n\u2009=\u20094 mice per time point except for d6 LCMV Arm, n\u2009=\u20093. SEMs are shown as bars). Representative flow cytometric contour plots of Thy1.1-gated, adoptively transferred P14 CD8+ T cells at 42 days postinfection with Arm (c) or CL13 (d) are shown.

                        "To further examine SIRP\u03b1 expression on CD8+ T cells during chronic infection, we analyzed naive controls (Fig.\u00a01f) and mice infected with FV16 during early acute infection (7 days postinfection (dpi) (Fig.\u00a01g), late acute infection when T cell responses peak (14 dpi) (Fig.\u00a01h), and chronic infection (>6 wpi) (Fig.\u00a01i) when T cells are exhausted17. FV-specific CD8+ T cells were stained with dextramers specific for the immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitope, gagL32,33, and with the activation marker CD11a34 (Fig.\u00a01f\u2013i). Subpopulations gated for these markers as indicated by quadrants with arrows were then analyzed for the expression of PD-1 and SIRP\u03b1. Consistent with previous reports, almost all CD8+ T cells from naive mice were SIRP\u03b1\u2212 and did not stain with FV-specific dextramers (Fig.\u00a01f, l). At 7 dpi, there were still very few dextramer+ cells, but by 14 dpi there was a distinct subpopulation of activated, dextramer+ cells (Fig.\u00a01h) that expressed PD-1 and a large majority of which (mean\u2009=\u200972.3%) also expressed SIRP\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a01j) albeit at lower levels than macrophages (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). During chronic infections, dextramer+ cells were preserved (Fig.\u00a01i), expressed PD-1 (Fig.\u00a01k), and about one third of them also expressed SIRP\u03b1 (mean\u2009=\u200934.5%) (Fig.\u00a01k). Cells high in SIRP\u03b1 expression were generally also high in PD-1 expression (Fig.\u00a01j, k). SIRP\u03b1 was also expressed on activated (CD11a+) CD8+ T cells responding to other FV peptides (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Thus SIRP\u03b1 was expressed on activated CD8+ T cells during both acute (Fig.\u00a01j) and chronic FV infection (Fig.\u00a01k and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03) while non-activated cells remained predominantly negative (Fig.\u00a01l\u2013o)."

                        "To examine the kinetics of SIRP\u03b1 upregulation during FV infection, adoptive transfer experiments were performed using labeled, FV-specific TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells35 carrying the Thy1.1+ genetic marker. Naive donor cells were adoptively transferred into Thy1.2+ mice that were either acutely (7 dpi) or chronically (>6 wpi) infected with FV. Such cells adoptively transferred into acutely infected mice are highly functional, whereas they rapidly become dysfunctional upon transfer into chronically infected recipients17. Three days after transfer, the donor cells were analyzed for the expression of SIRP\u03b1, PD-1, and proliferation (dilution of fluorescent signal). Pearson correlation analyses showed highly significant correlations between the expression of PD-1 and SIRP\u03b1 in both acutely and chronically infected mice (Fig.\u00a02a, e). Both PD-1 and SIRP\u03b1 expression were induced during cell division (Fig.\u00a02b, c, f, g) and the expression data were quantified for multiple mice at each cell division (Fig.\u00a02d, h). In chronically infected mice, SIRP\u03b1 expression was rapidly induced in about 20% of the transferred cells and slightly but significantly increased to about 35% (Fig.\u00a02h), similar to the endogenous subset (Fig.\u00a01k). By contrast, cells transferred into acutely infected mice showed increasing levels of SIRP\u03b1 expression throughout all divisions (Fig.\u00a02d). Thus donor cells from the same pool of naive SIRP\u03b1\u2212 cells had much different levels and kinetics of SIRP\u03b1 induction dependent on whether they were transferred into acutely infected or chronically infected mice.Fig. 2Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) expression kinetics during Friend virus (FV) infection. Day 7 acute or chronically infected mice were adoptively transferred with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 bead-purified and CellTraceTM (violet)\u2013labeled CD8+ T cells from the spleens of naive Thy1.1+ CD8.TCR transgenic mice. The spleens of recipient mice were analyzed by flow cytometry at 72\u2009h post-transfer. (a, e) Analysis of dual expression of PD-1 and SIRP\u03b1 by Pearson correlation showed highly significant correlation (P\u2009<\u2009.0001 for both actue and chronic). Representative plots showing the expression of PD-1 (b, f) and SIRP\u03b1 (c, g) during proliferation (analyzed by dilution of CellTraceTM fluorescence) is shown on donor cells from acute and chronic recipients. Quantification of results from individual mice during acute (d) and chronic infection (h) are shown with each dot representing an individual mouse and the bar representing the mean. The 1\u20138 designation depicts the gating strategy for identifying individual cell divisions, but the numbers are only relative as the zero division expression of CellTrace was not evident. Data are from one of two independent experiments with similar results. Linear regression analyses were used to draw the lines in d (R2\u2009=\u20090.6148, P\u2009=\u20090.0369) and h (R2\u2009=\u20090.8837, P\u2009=\u20090.0053). The difference between the slopes of the lines for acute (m\u2009=\u20095.781) vs chronic (m\u2009=\u20091.836) was very significant, P\u2009=\u2009.0088. During transfer into chronically infected mice (h), there was a slight but significant increase in the proportion of cells expressing SIRP\u03b1 between cell division 2 (mean\u2009=\u200923.5) and cell division 7 (mean\u2009=\u200932.83), P\u2009=\u20090.0241 by two-way Student\u2019s t test.

                        "To determine whether the FV-specific PD-1/SIRP\u03b1 double-positive CD8+ T cells from chronically infected mice comprised a subset of cells with a distinct phenotype, the expression of additional markers was examined by flow cytometry. The PD-1+ SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells from chronically infected mice also expressed high levels of the co-inhibitory receptors Tim3 and Lag3, CD95 (Fas), which leads to apoptosis upon ligand binding, and IL-2R\u03b2 chain (CD122), which helps drive a PD-1hi phenotype36 (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d). This expression pattern would suggest an exhausted phenotype except that these cells also expressed high levels of the activation/co-stimulatory molecules, CD43, CD44, CD40, and CD278 (inducible T cell co-stimulator) (Fig.\u00a03e\u2013h). Neither the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 or the SIRP\u03b1+ subsets showed high expression of the terminal differentiation marker, KLRG1, but mean expression was twice as high on the SIRP\u03b1+ subset as the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset (Fig.\u00a03i). The expression of CD62L (L-selectin lymphoid homing receptor) on SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells, which is downregulated during activation but returns on memory T cells, was intermediate between SIRP\u03b1\u2212 CD8+ T cells and naive CD8+ T cells (Fig.\u00a03j). SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of CD47, the ligand for SIRP\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a03k), which is\u00a0an IFN-inducible gene and its increased expression marks functional, long-lived memory CD4+ T cells37. CX3CR1, reported to identify granzyme B positive, cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells38,39 was also much higher on SIRP\u03b1+ than SIRP\u03b1\u2212 CD8+ T cells (Fig.\u00a03l). Thus the PD-1+ SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells had a unique surface marker expression phenotype with high expression of both co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory molecules and characteristics of a functional memory phenotype.Fig. 3Phenotype of Friend virus (FV)-specific PD-1+ SIRP\u03b1\u2212 and PD-1+ SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells in mice chronically infected with FV.

                        "To gain a broad perspective of the differences between CD8+ T cells expressing SIRP\u03b1 or not, whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-SEQ) was performed on cell-sorted populations of splenic SIRP\u03b1\u2212 and SIRP\u03b1+ FV-specific TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells that had been adoptively transferred into FV chronically infected mice 2 weeks earlier. A total of 325 transcripts were differentially expressed at a significant level between the subpopulations, and 82% of the differentially expressed transcripts were upregulated in the SIRP\u03b1+ population (Supplementary data\u00a01). Granzyme B (Gzmb), Ki-67 (Mki67) IFN-\u03b3 (IFNG), and the inflammatory chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 were significantly upregulated in the SIRP\u03b1+ subset (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary data\u00a01), which is consistent with these cells expressing markers of activation and co-stimulation (Fig.\u00a03). Analysis of the top 100 most differentially upregulated genes by gene set enrichment analysis (ToppFun) revealed that the top biological process upregulated by SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells was positive regulation of the immune system followed by active proliferation (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Intriguingly, the next highest biological process was negative immune regulation. Thus the SIRP\u03b1+ T cells transcribed numerous genes capable of both immune activation and inhibitory functions with a skewing toward activation. Comparison of the genes that correlated with SIRP\u03b1 expression in LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells with the genes significantly upregulated in FV-specific PD1+ SIRP\u03b1+ CD8 T cells identified 158 genes that were shared (Supplementary data\u00a02 and Supplementary Figure\u00a04). The most downregulated gene in the SIRP\u03b1+ subset was Perm1, an inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation40 typically utilized by exhausted T cells, whereas effector T cells downregulate mitochondrial biogenesis in favor of the glycolytic pathway41. Another highly downregulated gene was an inhibitor of T cell activation, Pik3ip142. Thus the phenotyping (Fig.\u00a03) and transcriptional profiling (Fig.\u00a04) results indicated that SIRP\u03b1 identified a unique subset within the exhausted population of CD8+ T cells that preserved effector function.Fig. 4Differential gene expression of bulk sorted SIRP\u03b1\u2212 or SIRP\u03b1+ transgenic CD8+PD-1+ T cells.

                        "To determine whether the function of the SIRP\u03b1+ subset differed from the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset, FV-specific (dextramer+) CD8+ T cells from acutely (Fig.\u00a05a) and chronically (Fig.\u00a05b) infected mice were stained for intracellular expression of granzyme B and surface expression of CD107a, an indicator of recent cytolytic activity. Both the SIRP\u03b1+ and SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subsets had cells expressing granzyme B (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013g). Importantly, almost no SIRP\u03b1\u2212 cells expressed CD107a while more than half of the SIRP\u03b1+ cells were CD107a+, indicating that they had recently undergone exocytosis (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f, h). Similar results were found from both acutely and chronically infected mice. In acutely infected mice, a large percentage of both the SIRP\u03b1+ and SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subsets had recently proliferated (Ki-67+), although the proportion in the SIRP\u03b1+ subset was significantly higher (Fig.\u00a05i). In chronically infected mice, very few SIRP\u03b1\u2212 cells were Ki-67+, whereas a mean of approximately 35% of the SIRP\u03b1+ subset was Ki-67+ (Fig.\u00a05i). Thus the SIRP\u03b1+ subset appeared more functional in both cytolytic activity and proliferative capacity than the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset, confirming the transcriptional profile results provided by the RNA-SEQ analysis and ToppFun analysis (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary data\u00a01, and Supplementary Tables\u00a01).Fig. 5Signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) expression on PD-1+ CD8+ T cells identifies cells with enhanced proliferation and cytolytic ability.

To obtain sufficient cells for the assay and to avoid stimulating sorted cells by crosslinking with dextramers, we performed adoptive transfers of genetically labeled (Thy1.1+), FV-specific, TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant FV gag peptide43. The cells were adoptively transferred into chronically infected recipients where they were allowed to proliferate and become exhausted for 13\u201315 days. They were then harvested and fluorescence-activated cell sorted into SIRP\u03b1\u2212 and SIRP\u03b1+ subpopulations and co-cultured with either FV-gag peptide-loaded target cells or control cells. As expected for CD8+ T cells from a chronic infection, the in vitro CTL activity was low but significantly more FV-specific killing was observed with the SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells than with the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset (Fig.\u00a05j). For comparison, SIRP\u03b1+ and SIRP\u03b1\u2212 CD8+ T cell effectors taken from acutely infected mice displayed much higher killing frequencies than cells from chronic infections (Fig.\u00a05k), but consistent with the chronic infection results, more killing was observed with the SIRP\u03b1+ subset compared to the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset. Thus, during both acute and chronic FV infections, the expression of SIRP\u03b1 correlated with enhanced cytolytic ability (Fig.\u00a05j, k) and proliferative capacity (Figs.\u00a04 and 5i), suggesting that SIRP\u03b1 identified cells that sustained an antiviral response during chronic infection. Such a role has been associated with the transcription factor, T cell factor-1 (TCF-1)44 and we observed significantly higher intracellular TCF-1 expression in the SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T subset than in the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset (Fig.\u00a05l, m)."

                        "To confirm that cytolytically active CTLs were present in chronically infected mice and to ascertain whether SIRP\u03b1 was playing a functional role in that activity, an in vivo CTL killing experiment was performed using viral peptide-loaded target cells that either expressed CD47, the ligand for SIRP\u03b1, or had a gene inactivation of CD4745. Target cells from both WT and CD47 null genotypes, either FV peptide-loaded or control-treated, were differentially labeled with fluorescent stains (Fig.\u00a06a), and all four types of target cells were adoptively transferred at equivalent numbers (Fig.\u00a06b) into naive or chronically infected mice (Fig.\u00a06c, d). Spleens were harvested 6\u2009h after transfer and analyzed by flow cytometry for killing. CD47 null target cells were susceptible to macrophage-mediated phagocytosis regardless of loading with cognate peptide but no virus-specific killing of targets was observed in naive mice as both control targets and peptide-loaded targets remained at the starting ratio of 50:50 (Fig.\u00a06c). In contrast, virus-specific killing was observed in chronically infected mice (Fig.\u00a06d), which was quantified in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, four of the six chronically infected mice tested displayed CD8+ CTL activity, and the virus-specific killing was significantly greater in WT targets than in CD47 null targets (Fig.\u00a06e). In the second experiment, all 14 mice displayed CTL activity, which was again significantly greater against the WT targets compared to the CD47 null targets (Fig.\u00a06f). Interestingly, compared to uninfected cells from a FV-infected mouse, the infected cells significantly upregulated expression of CD47 (Fig.\u00a07). Thus SIRP\u03b1-CD47 ligation was not required for cytolysis in vivo, but it significantly enhanced cytolysis.Fig. 6Enhanced in vivo cytolytic activity against target cells expressing CD47, the ligand for signal-regulatory protein alpha. Naive and mice chronically infected with Friend virus (FV) were adoptively transferred with differentially fluorophore-labeled target cells as outlined in a and in Methods.

                        "To determine whether SIRP\u03b1 expression could also be found on human T cells during a chronic viral infection, CD8+ T cells from healthy controls or patients with chronic HCV (Table\u00a01) were examined using CyTOF, flow cytometry that uses heavy metal ion-tagged antibodies. In CD8+ T cells from both HCV uninfected and infected patients, the main subset was SIRP\u03b1 negative (Fig.\u00a08a, b). However, in HCV patients there was a subpopulation of CD8+ T cells with increased expression of SIRP\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a08a, b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, b). We analyzed CD57 and CD28 markers because chronic antigenic stimulation of human CD8+ T cells is associated with the upregulation of CD57\u00a0and downregulation of costimulatory CD28. The CD57+ CD28\u2212 subset is increased in HCV patients46. Although this subset is heterogenous, it is generally associated with a reduced state of function and proliferation47. SIRP\u03b1 expression was significantly higher on CD8+ T cells from HCV-infected individuals compared to controls in both the functional CD57\u2212 CD28+ subset as well as the CD57+ CD28\u2212 subset (Fig.\u00a08c). Samples from one patient were also tested by flow cytometry and an example of the data and comparison with SIRP\u03b1 expression on macrophages is shown (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). Thus SIRP\u03b1 is also expressed on human CD8+ T cells and is upregulated during chronic HCV infections. SIRP\u03b1+ cells from both CD57\u2212 and CD57+ subsets also had higher levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3), CD244/2B4, and HLA-DR, indicating a higher activation status compared to their SIRP\u03b1\u2212 counterparts (Fig.\u00a08d\u2013f). These results are consistent with SIRP\u03b1+ marking a subset of functional CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, stimulation\u00a0of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\u00a0with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 5 days led to significant upregulation of SIRP\u03b1 on proliferating CD8+ T cells in comparison to unstimulated controls (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d, e).Table 1HCV patient characteristicsIDPrevious IFNGenotypeLiver transplant waitlistSex2Yes1NoMale4Yes1NoFemale7No2NoFemale8Yes2NoFemale9Yes1NoMale12No2NoFemale13No1YesFemale14Yes1NoMale20Yes1NoMale22Yes1NoFemale27Yes1NoMale29Yes1YesMale30No4NoFemale35No1NoMale38Yes1NoMaleHCV hepatitis C virus, IFN interferonFig. 8Increased signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) expression on CD8+ T cells from hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients identifies a more activated phenotype. a Representative plots of CyTOF analysis of the median healthy donor and (b) the median HCV patient donor in regards to SIRP\u03b1 expression levels. c CD8+ CD57\u2212 CD28+ (circles) and CD8+ CD57+ CD28\u2212 (squares) peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy controls (open symbols) and HCV-infected patients (closed symbols) were analyzed by CyTOF for SIRP\u03b1 expression.

                "Until now, SIRP\u03b1 has been considered to primarily be an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed predominantly on myeloid cells in the hematopoietic compartment21,48. The results presented here present a more complex picture, both in terms of cell-specific expression and perhaps the nature of the signaling. We confirm that SIRP\u03b1 has little or no expression on naive T cells, as previously shown in mice49, rats50, and humans51. However, we now show that SIRP\u03b1 is expressed on activated CTL during viral infection. Such expression may have previously been missed owing to examination of only naive cells. In addition to the expanded cell-specific expression profile, it is possible that SIRP\u03b1 signaling in CD8+ T cells may not be negative. During both acute and chronic FV infections, almost all CD8+ T cells that showed evidence of recent cytolytic activity (CD107a+) were also SIRP\u03b1+ (Fig.\u00a05h). Compared to the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 subset, the SIRP\u03b1+ subset was also significantly more proliferative (Ki-67+) (Fig.\u00a05i), expressed higher levels of TCF-1 (Fig.\u00a05m), had higher expression of IFN-\u03b3 message (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary data\u00a01), and transcribed significantly more genes indicative of immune activation (Fig.\u00a04, Supplementary data\u00a01). Furthermore, cell-sorted SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells from chronically infected mice had greater in vitro cytotoxicity than the SIRP\u03b1\u2212 cells from the same mice (Fig.\u00a05j). However, SIRP\u03b1 might simply mark the active CTL subset rather than positively regulating CD8+ T cell functions. CTL targets lacking CD47 were nevertheless killed by CTL in vivo, albeit to a significantly lower level than targets expressing CD47 (Fig.\u00a06e, f). These results indicate that SIRP\u03b1\u2013CD47 interactions are involved in the cytolytic process but do not address whether SIRP\u03b1 acts as a positive or negative regulator of functional CTL development. Given the high level of co-stimulatory molecules expressed by SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells (Fig.\u00a03), it is possible that negative signaling by SIRP\u03b1 could be overcome by positive regulatory signaling. Further studies will be required to determine how SIRP\u03b1 expression, specifically in CD8+ T cells, impacts development and function. What is most evident and novel from the data is that cell-specific SIRP\u03b1 expression is not as limited as previously thought, that it is expressed on the most proliferative and functionally active subset of CD8+ T cells in both acute and chronic infections, and that it is involved in the cytolytic process. As such, SIRP\u03b1 will allow scientists and clinicians to follow the expansion or contraction of the functional subset during immunotherapy with relevance not only to infections but also cancer and autoimmune diseases. We find that SIRP\u03b1 protein surface expression is increased not only in activated mouse T cells but also in activated human T cells, suggesting that this may be a conserved marker of active CD8+ T cells. The elevated SIRP\u03b1 levels on CD8+ T cells from patients with chronic HCV infection was most pronounced on the CD57\u2212 CD28+ subset.",
                "It is worth considering how SIRP\u03b1\u2013CD47 interactions might be involved in the cytolytic process in vivo since cognate target cells that did not express CD47 were killed less effectively than WT target cells in multiple in vivo CTL assays (Fig.\u00a06e, f). One possibility is that SIRP\u03b1 delivered activating rather than inhibitory signals, which is not unprecedented. It has previously\u00a0been shown that SIRP\u03b1 signaling in macrophages could activate the production of nitrous oxide and reactive oxygen species via Janus-activated kinase/STAT and phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Rac1/NOX/H2O2 pathways52. SIRP\u03b1-mediated positive signaling in macrophages is also required for migration and chemotaxis22,53. In addition, T cells from SIRP\u03b1 mutant mice exposed to autoimmune antigens54,55 or flagellin26 showed reduced cytokine production, which was attributed to decreased numbers of DCs in the lymphoid tissues of such mice23. However, it may also have been an intrinsic T cell property since expression of SIRP\u03b1 on T cells was neither known at the time nor tested. Thus SIRP\u03b1 is capable of delivering activating as well as inhibitory signals depending on the context including the presence of adapter proteins such as Skap253 and GRB256 and phosphatases such as SHP157 and SHP258. No evidence of differential expression of Shp1 or Shp2 was found in the RNA-SEQ analysis (data not shown), but Skap2 transcription was increased 2.8-fold in the SIRP\u03b1+ subset (Supplementary data\u00a01). Interestingly, one of the most highly overexpressed genes in the SIRP\u03b1+ subset (20\u00d7 increase, Supplementary data\u00a01) was Lyn. Lyn is a tyrosine protein kinase with a role in regulating cell activation, and like SIRP\u03b1, it has an inhibitory role in myeloid cells59. In B cells, Lyn phosphorylation initiates an activation cascade60, indicating that like SIRP\u03b1 it can deliver either inhibitory or activating signals in a context-dependent manner. Alternatively, it is possible that SIRP\u03b1\u2013CD47 interactions simply stabilize cell-to-cell contacts and the cytolytic synapse. The spanning distance of end-to-end bound CD47\u2013SIRP\u03b1 complexes (~14\u2009nm, similar to TCR\u2013MHC, CD28\u2013CD86, and CD40\u2013CD40L) suggests that significant binding between a target and effector cell would take place predominantly in immunological synapses where abundant bulkier cell surface proteins such as CD43 and CD45 that can sterically hinder more short range interactions are redistributed outside of the cytolytic synapse61. The strength of the interactions between cells is influenced not only by the affinity between the receptors and ligands but also by their density. Thus the high expression of SIRP\u03b1 on CTL combined with upregulated CD47 on infected targets (Fig.\u00a07) could have a significant impact on the strength and duration of interactions within the immunological synapse as has been previously suggested62.",
                "Prior to these experiments, it was known that virus-specific CD8+ T cells were sustained in FV chronically infected mice, albeit at low numbers (~1\u20133% of CD8+ T cells). It is now apparent that the FV-specific CD8+ T cells in mice with chronic FV are heterogeneous with respect to function and that there is a cytolytically active subset that can be identified by cell surface expression of SIRP\u03b1. As discussed, this active subset displays high expression of both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013h). Immune checkpoint inhibition by anti-PD-L1 produced an expanded population of CTL, the large majority of which expressed SIRP\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a09). In chronic LCMV infections the degree of expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors has been shown to correlate with the severity of T cell dysfunction6, but expression of co-inhibitory receptors is not specific to exhausted cells and occurs during T cell activation as well. Thus it is not possible to differentiate dysfunctional T cells from activated T cells based only on the expression of co-inhibitory receptors. Recently, there has been shown to be a great deal of heterogeneity in the level of dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in an exhausted setting such as within a tumor or in a chronic infection63,64. A detectable level of function and virus control persists in chronic viral settings as evidenced by the fact that CD8+ T cell-escape variants arise in chronic HIV infections65,66 and that viral titers increase following depletion of CD8+ T cells in simian immunodeficient virus-infected macaques67,68. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in mice with chronic FV infections does not produce virus relapse, but this is likely due to compensatory mechanisms by antiviral CD4+ T cells69 and does not indicate that the residual CD8+ T cells exert no control over chronic infection. The SIRP\u03b1-positive and -negative CD8+ T cell subsets during exhaustion did not have significantly different expression levels of Tbet, EOMES, CTLA4, or Bcl2 (Supplementary data\u00a01). Although the SIRP\u03b1+ subset displayed higher levels of CD44, Ki67, TCF-1, and CD62L suggesting a functional memory phenotype, they also displayed high levels of co-inhibitory receptors indicating a different phenotype than previously described for exhausted or functional cells6.",
                "We have shown that the expression of SIRP\u03b1 on CD8+ T cells is diagnostic for the presence of active CTLs, even in exhausted settings. Thus SIRP\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells are interesting targets for immunotherapy, especially if they can be specifically expanded or further activated to kill chronically infected cells and/or tumors. The fact that target cells without CD47 expression were still targets for CTL killing, albeit to a lesser extent than targets with CD47 expression, is important when considering using CD47 blockade to treat cancer. CD47 is overexpressed by human cancer cells, allowing them to evade macrophage-mediated phagocytosis29,70,71. CD47 blockade has been shown to potentiate macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells in numerous models28,72 and is currently in several clinical trials to treat various cancers. The current results suggest that, while activating macrophage antitumor phagocytosis, CD47 blockade might also inhibit CD8+ T cell antitumor activity. However, such inhibition might be overcome using PD-1 blockade, a cancer immunotherapy currently thought to function primarily via CD8+ T cell activation. Interestingly, it was recently shown that, similar to tumor-infiltrating T cells, tumor-associated macrophages also express PD-1 co-inhibitory receptors73. Thus cancer therapies targeting PD-1 or its ligand could be activating macrophage functions as well as T cells. A combination of PD-1 and CD47 blockade could have synergistic effects by potentiating the antitumor activity by both macrophages and T cells."

Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) infected with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) LCMV Armstrong (Arm)\u2014which causes an acute infection\u2014or intravenously (i.v.) with 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 p.f.u. LCMV Clone 13 (Cl13)\u2014which causes a chronic infection. The use of all animals was conducted in accordance with Yale University IACUC guidelines. For FV studies, mice were female (C57BL/10\u2009\u00d7\u2009A.BY) F1 (Y10) (H-2b/b, Fv1b, Rfv3r/s, Fv2r/s) and FV-specific Thy1.1+ CD8.TCR transgenic mice between 12 and 24 weeks of age at the beginning of the experiments and were bred at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. The FV stock has been passaged in mice for more than three decades and contains three separate viruses: (1) B-tropic Friend murine leukemia helper virus (F-MuLV), which is a replication competent retrovirus; (2) polycythemia-inducing spleen focus-forming virus, which is a defective retrovirus that is packaged by F-MuLV-encoded virus particles; and (3) lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, an endemic murine nidovirus related to coronaviruses75. Mice were infected by i.v. injection of 0.2\u2009mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1500 spleen focus-forming units of FV complex. Mice were considered chronically infected at 6 weeks postinfection when F-MuLV levels stabilize at approximately 104 infectious centers per spleen. Splenocytes were isolated by tissue homogenization through a 100-\u03bcm filter and red blood cells were removed using lysis buffer (0.15\u2009M NH4Cl, 10\u2009mM KHCO3, 0.1\u2009M EDTA). Mice were treated in accordance with RML IACUC-approved animal use protocols following the regulations and guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories and the National Institute of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare."

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) P84 specificity is based on the following: signal regulatory proteins (SIRP\u03b1 and SIRP\u03b2 in the mouse) are expressed on neurons, hematopoietic stem cells, and myeloid cells including macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes, and DCs76. DCs, macrophages, and mononcytes from mice with targeted SIRP\u03b1 gene disruptions completely lose reactivity with mAb p84 (anti- SIRP\u03b1) even though their SIRP\u03b2 expression is normal. These results indicate specificity of p84 for SIRP\u03b1 without cross-reactivity for SIRP\u03b277. For FV-specific H-2Db/Abu-Abu-L-Abu-LTVFL staining, allophycocyanin (APC)- or PE-Db gagL-MHC Dextramer (Immudex, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used at 1/25. For intracellular staining, cells were surfaced stained and fixed prior to permeabilization. The antibodies used for intracellular staining were PE-anti-EOMES (Dan11mag, eBioscience 12-4875-82, lot E10466-1634;1/200); PE-Cy7-anti-Tbet (eBio4B10, eBioscience 25-5825-82, lot 4277988; 1/200); A700-anti-Ki67 (B56, BD Pharmigen 561277, lot 7073537; 1/200); PE-anti-TCF-1 (S33-966, BD Biosciences 564217, lot 8081983; 1/200), and APC-anti-human granzyme B (GRB05; Molecular Probes Invitrogen GRB05, lot 1908524; 1/50). To stain for intracellular granzyme B, cells were fixed overnight in 0.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and then permeabilized with 0.1% saponin/PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 50\u2009mM glucose. To stain for all other intracellular markers, intracellular staining was performed using the eBioscience Foxp3 Kit, following the company\u2019s recommendation. To detect FV-infected cells, cells were stained with tissue culture supernatant containing mAb (MAb 34), which is specific for F-MuLV glycosylated Gag protein (mAb34 was produced at RML/NIAID/NIH as a culture supernatant). MAb 34 binding was detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG2b (R12-3, BD Pharmigen 553395, lot 32885; 1/800). The muliparameter data were collected with an LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using the FlowJo software (version 10.2; TreeStar, Inc.)."

For proliferation assays, the cells were then CellTraceTM violet-labeled as directed (Invitrogen). A total of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CD8+ T cells were transferred i.v. into either acutely infected (7 dpi) or chronically FV-infected recipients. At 72\u2009h post-transfer, the splenocytes were surface stained and then analyzed for CellTraceTM dilution. For the in vitro CTL assay, CD8+ T cells from naive FV-specific Thy1.1+ CD8.TCR transgenic\u00a0mice were transferred i.v. into Y10 mice chronically or acutely infected with FV. After 13\u201315 days, CD8+ cells were purified from the spleens of these recipients using anti-CD8 paramagnetic beads and the Miltenyi MACS system following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were then stained with PE-Cy7-anti-Thy1.1; A700-anti-CD8; PE-CF594-anti-PD-1; and PerCPCy5.5-anti-SIRP\u03b1 and sorted into CD8+Thy1.1+PD-1+SIRP\u03b1\u2212 and CD8+Thy1.1+PD-1+SIRP\u03b1+ populations using a BD FACSAriaIIu. Sorted populations were \u226595% pure in all assays as determined by flow cytometry. For a negative control effectors, bead purified CD8+ T cells from naive Y10 mice were used. As target cells for these assays, CD8-depleted splenocytes that were either 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treated (control targets) or peptide pulsed with 25\u2009\u03bcM DbGagL peptide in 1% DMSO for 1\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C were used. These target cell and effector cell populations were then placed in a 2-h in vitro cytotoxic killing assay at a 1:4 (10,000:40,000 cells) or 1:10 (10,000:100,000) target:effector ratio (T:E) for 2\u2009h in the substrate following recommendations from the PanToxiLux Kit (OncoImmunin, Inc.). The samples were then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry for substrate fluorescence. For data quantification, the \u201cbackground\u201d level of substrate fluorescence from the DMSO control targets was subtracted from the CTL-killing level of the gag-peptide-loaded targets for each individual sample."
