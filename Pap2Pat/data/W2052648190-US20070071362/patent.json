    "abstract": "A method is provided of solving the dynamic super-resolution (SR) problem of reconstructing a high-quality set of monochromatic or color superresolved images from low-quality monochromatic, color, or mosaiced frames. The invention includes a joint method for simultaneous SR, deblurring, and demosaicing, this way taking into account practical color measurements encountered in video sequences. For the case of translational motion and common space-invariant blur, the proposed invention is based on a very fast and memory efficient approximation of the Kalman filter (KF). Experimental results on both simulated and real data are supplied, demonstrating the invention algorithms, and their strength.",

                        "Theoretical and practical limitations usually constrain the achievable resolution of any imaging device. While higher quality images may result from more expensive imaging systems, often it is desirable to increase the resolution of images previously captured under non-ideal situations. For instance, enhancing the quality of a video sequence captured by surveillance cameras in a crime scene is an example of these situations. The basic idea behind super-resolution is the fusion of a sequence of low-resolution noisy blurred images to produce a higher-resolution image. Early works on super-resolution showed that it is the aliasing effects in the low-resolution images that enable the recovery of the high-resolution fused image, provided that a relative subpixel motion exists between the undersampled input images. In contrast to the clean but practically naive frequency-domain description of super-resolution proposed in the early works on this subject, in general, super-resolution is a computationally complex and numerically ill-posed problem in many instances. In recent years, more sophisticated super-resolution methods have been developed.",
                        "Previous approaches have used super-resolution applied on an image sequence, producing a sequence of super-resolution images. At time point t, a super-resolution result is desired that fuses the causal images at times t, t\u22121, . . . , 1. The approaches were to apply the regular super-resolution on this set of images with the tth frame as a reference, produce the super-resolution output, and repeat this process all over again per each temporal point. This is referred to as the static super-resolution method, since it does not exploit the temporal evolution of the process. The memory and computational requirements for the static process are so taxing as to preclude its direct application to the dynamic case, without highly efficient algorithms.",

Further, this method uses a pixel-wise mean-covariance approximate of a Kalman filter for an optimal pilot fused image on a high resolution grid. Additionally, the invention applies advanced priors to both spatial and color-wise relationships for high quality recovery.

A MAP estimation technique is used to derive a hybrid method of dynamic super-resolution and multiframe demosaicing. Our method is also applicable to the case of color super-resolution.",
                        "For the case of translational motion and common space-invariant motion, a two-step algorithm is justified, which is also directly applicable for more complex motion and blur models. In the first step, a Kalman filter framework is used for fusing low-resolution images recursively in a fast and memory-efficient way, where the lower-resolution color images include color filtered images, compressed color images, compressed color filtered images, and an image sequence with color artifacts. In the second step, while deblurring and interpolating the missing values, luminance and color artifacts are reduced by using appropriate penalty terms. These terms were based on prior knowledge of the statistics of natural images and the properties of the human visual system. All matrix-vector operations in the proposed method are implemented as simple image operators.",
                        "In the current invention, a general linear dynamic forward model for the super-resolution problem is used. A dynamic scene with intensity distribution X(t) is seen to be warped at the camera lens because of the relative motion between the scene and camera, and blurred by camera lens and sensor integration. Then, it is discretized at the CCD, resulting in a digitized noisy frame Y(t). Discretization in many commercial digital cameras is a combination of color filtering and downsampling processes. However, here the treatment is restricted to simple monochrome imaging for discussion purposes. This forward model is represented by the following state-space equations \n\nX(t)=F(t)X(t\u22121)+U(t) \n\nY(t)=D(t)H(t)X(t)+W(t)",
                        "The equations given above describe a system in its statespace form, where X(t) describes how the ideal superresolved images relate to each other through time. The underscore notation, such as X, is used to indicate a vector derived from the corresponding image of size [rQ1\u00d7rQ2] pixels, scanned in lexicographic order. The current image X(t) is of size [r2Q1Q2\u00d71], where r is the resolution-enhancement factor, and [Q1\u00d7Q2] is the size of an input low-resolution image. The equation above for X(t) states that up to some innovation content U(t), the current high-resolution image is a geometrically warped version of the previous image, X(t\u22121). The [r2Q1Q2\u00d7r2Q1Q2] matrix F(t) represents this warp operator. The so-called system noise U(t), of size [r2Q1Q2\u00d71], is assumed to be additive zero-mean Gaussian with Cu(t) as its covariance matrix of size [r2Q1Q2\u00d7r2Q1Q2]. Note that the closer the overlapping regions of X(t) and the motion compensated X(t\u22121) are, the smaller Cu(t) becomes. Therefore, Cu(t) reflects the accuracy of the motion estimation process and for overlapped regions it is directly related to the motion estimation covariance matrix.",
                        "As to the equation for Y(t) above, it describes how the measured image Y(t) of size [Q1Q2\u00d71] is related to the ideal one, X(t). The camera's point spread function (PSF) is modeled by the [r2Q1Q2\u00d7r2Q1Q2] blur matrix H(t), while the [Q1Q2\u00d7r2Q1Q2] matrix D(t) represents the downsampling operation at the CCD (downsampling by the factor r in each axis). In mosaiced cameras, this matrix also represents the effects of the color filter array, which further downsamples the color images. The noise vector W(t) of size [Q1Q2\u00d71] is assumed to be additive, zero-mean, white Gaussian noise. Thus, its [Q1Q2\u00d7Q1Q2] covariance matrix is Cw(t)=\u03c3w2I. It is further assumed that U(t) and W(t) are independent of each other.",
                        "The equations given above describe a system in its state space form, where the state is the desired ideal image. Thus, a Kalman filter formulation can be employed to recursively compute the optimal estimates (X(t), t\u2208{1, . . . ,N}) from the measurements (Y(t), t\u2208{1, . . . ,N}), assuming that D(t), H(t), F(t), \u03c3w, and Cu(t) are all known. This estimate could be done causally, as an online processing of an incoming sequence, or noncausally, assuming that the entire image sequence is stored on disk and processed offline.",
                        "As to the assumption about the knowledge of various components of the current invention, while each of the operators D(t),H(t), and F(t)may vary in time, for most situations the downsampling (and later color filtering), and camera blurring operations remain constant over time assuming that the images are obtained from the same camera. In the current invention, we initially assume that the camera PSF is space-invariant, and the motion is composed of pure translations, accounting for either vibrations of a gazing camera, or a panning motion of a faraway scene. Thus, both H and F(t) are block-circulant matrices, and as such, they commute. It is assumed that H is known, being dependent on the camera used, and F(t) is built from motion estimation applied on the raw sequence Y(t). The downsampling operator D is completely dictated by the choice of the resolution-enhancement factor (r). As to \u03c3w, and Cu(t), those will be handled shortly.",
                        "By substituting (t)=HX(t) when using X(t)=F(t)X(t\u22121)+U(t), and Y(t)=D(t)H(t)X(t)+W(t), an alternative model is obtained, where the state vector is (t), \n\n(t)=F(t)(t\u22121)+V(t), \n\nY(t)=D(t)+W(t).",
                        "Note that for (t) here is obtained by left multiplication of both sides of X(t) by H and using the fact that it commutes with F(t). Thus, the vector V(t) is a colored version of U(t), leading to Cv(t)=HCu(t)HT as the covariance matrix.",
                        "With this alternative definition of the state of the dynamic system, the solution of the inverse problem at hand decomposes, without loss of optimality, into the much simpler subtasks of fusing the available images to compute the estimated blurry image (t), followed by a deblurring/interpolation step, estimating {circumflex over (X)}(t) from (t). Here, the three color bands are treated separately. For instance, only the red band values in the input frames, Y(t), contribute to the reconstruction of the red band values in (t). The correlation of the different color bands is discussed and exploited further below.",
                        "The application of Kalman filter to estimate an optimal pilot fused image (t) on a high resolution grid, in general, requires the update of the state vector's covariance matrix per each temporal point, and this update requires an inversion of the state vector's covariance matrix. For a superresolved image with r2Q1Q2 pixels, this matrix is of size [r2Q1Q2\u00d7r2Q1Q2], implying a prohibitive amount of computations and memory.",

Further, this method uses a pixel-wise mean-covariance approximate of a Kalman filter for an optimal pilot fused image on a high resolution grid. Additionally, the invention applies advanced priors to both spatial and color-wise relationships for high quality recovery. And, the method of the current invention uses a non-causal process mode, where each pilot fused image is derived as an optimal estimate incorporating information from all frames in a sequence using the smoothed approximated pixelwise Kalman filter to obtain an efficient algorithm.

                        "While in general the above equations require the propagation of intolerably large matrices in time, referring to Cv(t) as a diagonal matrix, then {tilde over (M)}(t) and {circumflex over (M)}(t) are diagonal matrices of size [r2Q1Q2\u00d7r2Q1Q2]. It is relatively easy to verify this property: for an arbitrary diagonal matrix GB (B stands for big), the matrix DGBDT is a diagonal matrix. Similarly, for an arbitrary diagonal matrix GS (S stands for small), the matrix DTGSD is diagonal as well. Also, it is known that for an arbitrary translation matrix F and an arbitrary diagonal matrix GB, the matrix FGBFT is diagonal. Therefore, if the matrix {tilde over (M)}(0) is initialized as a diagonal matrix, then {tilde over (M)}(t) and {circumflex over (M)}(t) are necessarily diagonal for all t, being the results of summation, multiplication, and inversions of diagonal matrices. Diagonality of Cv(t) is a key assumption in transferring the general Kalman filter into a simple and fast procedure. Choosing a matrix \u03c3v2I\u2267Cv(t), it implies that \u03c3v2I\u2212Cv(t) is a positive semidefinite matrix, and there is always a finite \u03c3v that satisfies this requirement.

The effect on the Kalman filter is to rely less on the temporal relation in (t)=F(t)(t\u22121)+V(t) and more on the measurements in Y(t)=D(t)+W(t). In fact, at the extreme case, if \u03c3v\u2192\u221e, the Kalman filter uses only the measurements, leading to an intraframe maximum likelihood estimator. Thus, more generally, such a change causes a loss in the accuracy of the Kalman filter because it relies less on the internal dynamics of the system, but this comes with a welcomed simplification of the recursive estimator. It must be clear that such change in Cv(t) has no impact on the convergence properties of the dynamic estimator applied, and it does not introduce a bias in the estimate. Note that all the above is true also for a diagonal non-Toeplitz alternative, where the main diagonal entries are varying in space.",

One possible solution involves applying monochromatic super-resolution algorithms to each of the color channels independently, while using the color information to improve the accuracy of motion estimation. Another approach is transforming the problem to a different color space, where chrominance layers are separated from luminance, and super-resolution is applied only to the luminance channel.

To better understand the multiframe demosaicing problem, an example is provided for the case of translational motion.

In the current invention an inter-color dependencies penalty term is used to encourage homogeneity of an edge location and orientation in different color bands. Although different bands may have larger or smaller gradient magnitudes at a particular edge, the statistics of natural images shows that it is reasonable to assume a same edge orientation for all color channels. That is, for instance, if an edge appears in the red band at a particular location, then an edge with the same orientation should appear in the other color bands at the same location as well. Minimizing the vector product norm of any two adjacent color pixels forces different bands to have similar edge orientation.

A 128\u00d7128 section of this image was blurred with a symmetric Gaussian lowpass filter of size 4\u00d74 pixels with standard deviation equal to one. The resulting images were subsampled by the factor of four in each direction and further color filtered with Bayer pattern creating a 32\u00d732 image. Gaussian noise was added to the resulting low-resolution frames to achieve SNR equal to 30 dB, where the SNR is defined as 10 log10 (\u03c32/\u03c3n2), where \u03c32 and \u03c3n2 are variances of a clean frame and noise, respectively The 128\u00d7128 window was consecutively shifted on the original high-resolution image by one pixel in right, down, or up directions, and repeated the same image degradation process.

Fifteen iterations of steepest descent were used for this experiment. The (unknown) camera PSF was assumed to be a 4\u00d74 Gaussian kernel with standard deviation equal to one.
