    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an in vitro method for diagnosing the infectious state of an individual on the basis of a sample of white corpuscles arising from a biological specimen taken from an organ potentially infected by a pathogenic micro-organism of said individual, comprising at least the following two steps: i) measuring the mean cellular intensity of the autofluorescence of said sample, and ii) comparing the intensity measured in step i) with a control value, so as to determine the infectious state of said individual. The diagnostic method of the invention uses a routine optical material making it possible to work in wavelength regions which are compatible with the cellular autofluorescence, and thus constitutes a rapid, reliable and inexpensive aid for the diagnosis or monitoring of an infection in an individual.",

                        "Severe sepsis or serious bacterial infection remains a major cause of hospital morbidity-mortality, more specifically in intensive care units. Furthermore, its current incidence of 3 to 11 cases per 1,000 inhabitants in the United States has increased by 8.7% per year over the past ten years. 14.6% of admissions to French intensive care units are related to this pathology. In spite of many improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, hospital mortality related to severe sepsis is estimated at 35% in France. It is now clear that the time period separating the admission of the patient from the initiation of the antibiotic therapy constitutes a major prognostic factor of mortality. The goal is thus, in the 21st century, to diagnose the infection as early as possible, which is a gauge of patient survival.",
                        "Moreover, one of the current issues in medicine is to be able to reduce the overall quantity of antibiotics used daily in order to fight the harmful effects of their widespread use (bacterial resistance and economic costs). The duration of antibiotic treatments for bacterial infections is currently at the heart of the principal debates. Rapid techniques for monitoring the infection in progress and thus of the effectiveness of the anti-infection treatments employed are thus necessary. These techniques will make it possible to stop treatments at the appropriate time and will give rise to a shortening of the duration of antibiotic treatments. In this way, they will lead to a reduction of the worldwide consumption of antibiotics.",
                        "However, the conventional microbiological techniques currently available, comprising direct examination and growth on nutritive media, do not provide a prompt response. Indeed, 24 to 48 hours are necessary to obtain a bacteriological diagnostic response. Similarly, gene amplification techniques (RT-PCR, for example) are very expensive because they rely upon sophisticated devices and they are not yet completely validated for diagnostic use.",
                        "To replace these microbiological or genetic techniques, there is thus an urgent need develop reliable and inexpensive methods making it possible to diagnose infections rather early in their development, and much faster than is currently possible.",
                        "However, it is known that the host's response to microorganisms is established in the first minutes of the infection: it is in fact nearly immediate. White blood cells, key cells of innate immunity, play a fundamental and very early role in the recognition and destruction of pathogenic agents. These defense mechanisms of the host against microbes (bacteria and viruses) are dependent upon specific receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Several of these TLRs play a central role in the recognition of bacteria: TLR4, for example, recognizes Gram-negative bacteria membrane components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), whereas TLR2 recognizes Gram-positive bacteria elements such as peptidoglycan (PGN). TLR3, 7 and 8 are endosomal receptors that recognize viral RNA. Once stimulated, these TLRs have the common characteristic of leading to the activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of NF-\u03baB dependent proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Furthermore, another signaling pathway constitutes an important mechanism of defense of innate immunity: the N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) receptor pathway. This peptide, a product of the breakdown of bacterial proteins, activates a G protein coupled receptor leading to a cascade of activation of intracytoplasmic kinases resulting in the phosphorylation of subunits whose assembly forms NADH-oxidase. This membrane enzyme complex enables monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PNN) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by oxidizing NADH to NAD. These ROS participate in the bactericidal activity of phagocytes.",
                        "The present Inventors show herein that it is possible to use, in quite particular experimental conditions, the autofluorescence of these white blood cells to reveal the early immunological activity which is established during the microbial infection (and thus the infectious state of an individual). The diagnostic method of the invention uses a routine optical material making it possible to work in wavelength ranges compatible with cellular autofluorescence, and thus constitutes a rapid, reliable and inexpensive aid to the diagnosis of an infection in an individual. It also makes it possible to very rapidly measure the effectiveness of anti-infection therapies established beforehand."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The method of the present invention uses the autofluorescence of special cells of the immune system in order to diagnose the presence of bacterial and/or viral agents in an individual at risk. Infectious bacterial and/or viral pathogens are capable, via the activation of TLRs, of causing early metabolic activity in these immune cells. This metabolic activity may be correlated with variations in the concentration of NAD(P)H, one of the essential coenzymes involved in cellular energy metabolism, characterized by its intracellular autofluorescence (Mayevsky A et al., Am J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007).",
                        "This endogenous fluorescent signal, usually a nuisance in the context of studies using fluorescent probes, is already exploited in the field of cancer research and cellular metabolism, its study making it possible to distinguish various metabolic states (U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,236, Palmer G M et al., Photochem Photobiol 2003; Li B H et al., World J. Gastroenterol. 2006). However, no diagnostic testing using the autofluorescence of cells of the immune system, and in particular those identified by the present Inventors, has ever been described or suggested.",
                        "In this field, only two studies have been carried out: first, the team of Petty et al. has shown the temporal and spatial oscillation of the autofluorescence signal in polymorphonuclear neutrophils stimulated by immune agonists, by attempting to characterize the various states of activation of these cells (Petty H. R. et al., PNAS 2001; 98:3145-3149). This study recalls that the autofluorescence of neutrophils and monocytes is mainly due to the presence of NADH which undergoes temporal oscillations and significant intracellular displacements, which can be induced by bacterial activation signals. It is important to note that the signal studied is a signal of undulatory variation of the autofluorescence intensity in time and space on a temporal scale of 0.1 \u03bcs to 20 \u03bcs, and on a spatial scale of a few microns. The space-time undulatory changes thus take place in an infinitesimal temporal interval succeeding the in vitro immune stimulation of PNN (several \u03bcs after stimulation by the immune agonist concerned). These results thus discourage the use of these autofluorescence fluctuations, too short in time and too localized in space, for a diagnostic method. Indeed, from the perspective of a diagnostic method, it is necessary for the metabolic state modified since time T1 of infection is stable over time and quantifiable at time T2 when the sample is taken. As the time interval separating the stimulation of the cells of interest and the demonstration of the activated metabolic state represents in practice a few hours to several days, it is thus absolutely incompatible with the time scales described by Petty et al.",
                        "The second study relates to the demonstration of the effect of tobacco on the autofluorescence of macrophages of the lung. Pauly et al. have indeed identified that smoking increases the intensity of this autofluorescence (Pauly J. L. et al., Microsc Res Tech 2005).",
                        "Furthermore, the international patent application WO 99/50642 describes a method for diagnosing infections, based on the exploitation of the autofluorescence of whole plasma of patients suffering from a viral infection (AIDS virus or hepatitis virus) to establish spectral emission characteristics distinguishing the plasma of sick patients from that of controls. The method of the present invention does not exploit the autofluorescence of plasma (as proposed by WO99/50642), but the autofluorescence of specific cells, namely immune cells (and, preferably, among these cells, monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) arising from whole blood or potentially infected organs.",
                        "The present Inventors have developed for the first time an experimental protocol making it possible to exploit the autofluorescence of white blood cells, and in particular the modulations of this autofluorescence related to their activation. They thus propose a reproducible, reliable and effective system for evaluating the infectious state of target individuals.",
                        "In a first aspect, the present invention thus relates to an in vitro method for diagnosing the infectious state of an individual based on a sample of immune cells arising from a biological specimen from said individual, said method comprising at least the following steps:\n\n\n- - i) measuring the mean cellular autofluorescence intensity of said\n    sample, and\n  - ii) comparing the intensity measured in step i) with a control\n    value, so as to determine the infectious state of said individual.",
                        "In the context of the present invention, when the state of an individual is \u201cinfectious,\u201d said individual is infected with a microorganism, preferably a bacterium, virus or fungus (yeast or filamentous). In a more preferred manner, said individual suffers from a bacterial infection. This state can already have been diagnosed before and the individual can be subjected to an anti-infection treatment (antibiotic). In this case, the diagnostic method of the invention is intended to evaluate if the infection is still present and/or if the treatment can be stopped.",
                        "Herein, \u201cindividual\u201d refers to an animal or a mammal, and in particular man.",
                        "A \u201cbiological\u201d specimen is defined in the present invention as any specimen of biological fluid, preferably arising from potentially infected organs and thus containing white blood cells. It is possible in the context of the present invention to take for example a sample of pulmonary fluid (in the case of pneumonia), of ascites (in infections of ascites fluid), of cerebrospinal fluid (in meningitis) or of blood, or of any other potentially infected organ.",
                        "In the context of the present invention, \u201cobtaining a sample of cells arising from a biological specimen\u201d consists of 1) taking a sample of biological fluid from an individual, preferably from an organ of an individual, and 2) specifically in the context of a blood sample, purifying from this sample the cells of interest by conventional cell biology methods, in order to obtain the sample of purified cells.",
                        "It should be noted that the optional step of cellular purification to preferentially obtain cells of interest is not necessary when a biological fluid other than blood is used. Indeed, for the other sampled fluids (pulmonary, cerebrospinal or ascites fluid), in the case of infection, these fluids will contain in large majority cells of interest (PNN and monocytes), and thus there is no need to purify them.",
                        "In the case of a blood sample, the volume taken is preferably at least 10 ml to 20 ml, so as to obtain sufficient cells of interest after purification. In the case of a sample of a fluid from an organ, a few ml are enough (500 \u03bcl to 1 ml per cytospin well).",
                        "The sample of cells that can be used in the diagnostic method of the invention can be either preserved at room temperature to be used extemporaneously (in practice, less than 5 hours after the sample is taken) or preserved at a temperature of 4\u00b0 C. in order to preserve the integrity of the cells until the operations of cell purification/isolation, fixing and/or measurement of autofluorescence intensity.",
                        "In the context of the presents invention, the \u201cmean cellular autofluorescence intensity\u201d measured in step i) of the diagnostic method of the invention is the total autofluorescence intensity for a cell suspension or a median cell value obtained on at least about 50 cells, preferably about 100 cells. It is then advisable to 1) subtract from this total value the value of autofluorescence due to possible contaminating cells, and 2) divide this remaining intensity by the number of cells of interest (monocytes or polymorphonuclear neutrophils) present in the sample studied. This final value will be the mean cell intensity in the context of the present invention.",
                        "Numerous software packages make it possible today to instantaneously obtain a quantification of cellular autofluorescence levels and to calculate the mean for a large number of cells (for example, MetaMorph, ImageJ, Imaris or any other image processing software known to persons skilled in the art).",
                        "The \u201ccontrol\u201d value (or \u201cstandard\u201d) to which it is advised to compare the autofluorescence intensity of the individual to be tested is the mean cellular autofluorescence intensity obtained from a large number of isolated cells arising from several healthy individuals not having had treatment for at least 7 days (notably neither antibiotic nor anti-inflammatory treatment), not exhibiting any declared detectable infection (no signs or symptoms of infection, such as, for example: fever, aches, pains, etc.). This control value is typically calculated on at least 100 cells isolated from at least 5 healthy individuals. It is calculated beforehand using the standard experimental parameters that will be used for the patient tested (notably in terms of optical material used, cell fixation method, excitation and emission wavelengths, temperature, pH, etc.).",
                        "Immune cells, also called \u201cwhite blood cells\u201d or \u201cleukocytes,\u201d are human blood cells containing a mono or multi-lobed nucleus, which play essentially a role in the defense of the organism against foreign agents in the context of innate immunity. Among white blood cells, mononuclear cells (B-cells, T-cells, monocytes, macrophages) are distinguished from polymorphonuclear cells (or \u201cgranulocytes,\u201d which include neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) (Keneth M. Murphy, Paul Tavers, & Mark Walport, Janeway's Immunobiology. 7th Edition)",
                        "In a preferred manner, in the context of the present invention, the white blood cells of said sample are selected from monocytes and/or polymorphonuclear neutrophils.",
                        "In a variant of the diagnostic method of the invention, the cell sample contains preferably at least about 80%, preferably about 90% of PNN, still more preferably at least about 95% of PNN.",
                        "Certain biological fluids taken directly from organs are known to contain only PNN. For example, fluids from bronchoalveolar lavage as well as from ascites contain mostly PNN (E. Pilly, Maladies infectieuses et tropicales, 22nd edition, 2010). In this case a preliminary purification step will not be necessary.",
                        "Preferably, the sample of biological fluid used in the present invention does not undergo a purification step because it naturally contains at least about 80%, preferably about 90% of PNN, still more preferably at least about 95% of PNN. The sample of biological fluid is thus preferentially a sample of BAL, ascites or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",
                        "Nevertheless, if a purification step were required to obtain a cell sample that can be used in the method of the invention (notably in the case of a blood sample), it is preferable first to isolate the polynucleated blood cells and then, by techniques known to persons skilled in the art, such as, for example, selection by separation on a magnetic column (anti-CD16), to obtain the polymorphonuclear neutrophils. To obtain a sample of polynucleated cells from a biological fluid, it is advisable to use one of the techniques well-known to persons skilled in the art. For example, mention may be made of the density gradient technique and then withdrawal of the lower band, which corresponds essentially to polymorphonuclear cells (see the Cederlane\u00ae, Tebu-bio technique described in the examples below).",
                        "Most cases of pneumonia have mostly neutrophilic formulas (mostly PNN). However, some are mostly monocytic or mixed (50/50). These proportions depend on the pathogenic agent responsible for the pneumonia, on the individual and/or on the more or less advanced stage of pneumonia. All the biological fluids referred to in the invention (blood, pulmonary fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, ascites fluid) can contain mostly monocytes in certain particular cases of infection.",
                        "In another variant of the diagnostic method of the invention, the cell sample thus contains preferably at least about 80%, preferably about 90% of monocytes, still more preferably at least about 95% of monocytes.",
                        "Preferably, the sample of biological fluid used in the present invention does not undergo a purification step because it naturally contains at least about 80%, preferably about 90% of monocytes, still more preferably at least about 95% of monocytes (in the case of pulmonary fluid, cerebrospinal fluid or ascites fluid).",
                        "If a purification step were required (the sample is of blood, for example), monocytes can be isolated from mononucleated cells by techniques well-known to persons skilled in the art. For example, positive selection by separation on a magnetic column (anti-CD14 antibody) can be carried out. To obtain a sample of mononucleated cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages) from a biological fluid, it is preferable to use cell biology techniques well-known to persons skilled in the art. For example, the density gradient technique can be used, and then the upper band comprising these cells can be withdrawn (see the Cederlane\u00ae, Tebu-bio technique described in the examples below).",
                        "Fluorescence is the property in which a molecule emits a photon in order to return from its excited state (following the absorption of another photon) to its ground state. Cells contain molecules that can become fluorescent when they are excited with rays of wavelengths in the visible or ultraviolet (UV) range. This emission of fluorescence, emanating from endogenous fluorophores, is an intrinsic property of cells called \u201cautofluorescence\u201d or \u201cendogenous fluorescence\u201d and must be distinguished from the fluorescence signals obtained by the addition of exogenous markers. The known fluorophores are: aromatic amino acids, lipophilic dyes, NADPH, flavins and porphyrins. Autofluorescence does not require specific marking (Monici M., Biotechnol Annu Rev. 2005).",
                        "The light source used in the method can thus take any form of optical tool as long as it is capable of providing a sufficiently powerful intensity of light in the wavelength range concerned. Although LASER UV (argon) sources are capable of providing an incidental beam with such characteristics, other optical tools capable of providing wavelength ranges compatible with the excitation of cellular NADH can also be used. This is the case with certain lamps (mercury, halogen, etc.) of LASER diode and white LASER lamps (delivering a continuous emission spectrum over a broad range of wavelengths).",
                        "To reveal and measure biological autofluorescence, it is possible to use 1) cells in suspension, i.e., cells that are not attached to a support and that move freely in a suitable liquid medium, or 2) cells fixed on a transparent support, preferably a glass slide.",
                        "According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the autofluorescence intensity of the cells of said sample is measured on cells in suspension. In this particular embodiment, the autofluorescence can be measured with systems that measure fluorescence without an observer being able to see these cells, for example by flow cytometry, spectrophotometry or microspectrofluorimetry.",
                        "In this case, the mean autofluorescence intensity is measured automatically by systems (flow cytometers, spectrophotometers) that measure the total fluorescence of each sample.",
                        "In another particular embodiment of the invention, the autofluorescence intensity of the cells of said sample is measured on chemically fixed cells placed on a slide compatible with the observation of fluorescence, preferably a transparent glass slide, and the autofluorescence is then measured with conventional fluorescence microscopy (epifluorescence microscopy), confocal microscopy or two-photon microscopy apparatuses.",

A mean of 4 images at a resolution of 1024 pixels/1024 pixels for a final size of 246 \u03bcm/246 \u03bcm was applied to display the image in If.",
                                "Twenty-nine mice were studied with 8 control mice, 9 mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, and 12 mice with Staphylococcus pneumonia. The mean cellular autofluorescence intensity decreases for the slides from the mice with pneumonia in relation to the cells from the BAL from the control mice. The majority of cells (PNN) from the BAL of the mice with pneumonia fluoresce less than those from the BAL of the control mice (44.8 AU vs 107.5 AU). A factor of 2 exists between the mean autofluorescence intensity of the cells from the BAL of the mice with pneumonia and the mean autofluorescence intensity of the cells from the BAL of the control mice. These results make it possible to distinguish cells arising from the BAL of the control mice and the cells arising from the BAL of the mice suffering from pneumonia; this determination is based on a difference in mean autofluorescence intensity. The observation of an variation of the autofluorescence signal of the cells from the BAL of the infected mice opposite that of the monocytes in the model of stimulation ex vivo, confirms that the majority of the cells contained in the BAL of the infected mice consist of PNN. This result is thus in agreement with the decrease in the autofluorescence intensity of the PNN stimulated ex vivo in relation to the non-stimulated PNN controls in the preceding model of the cytology of cells stimulated ex vivo. The difference in the direction of the variation of the mean autofluorescence intensity between stimulated PNN and monocytes probably lies in their notable differences in terms of energy metabolism and of means of defense against the pathogen that leads to their stimulation."
