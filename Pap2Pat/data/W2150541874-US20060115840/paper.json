    "title": "Novel design and controls for focused DNA microarrays: applications in quality assurance/control and normalization for the Health Canada ToxArray\u2122",
    "date": "2006-10-19",
    "abstract": "Background Microarray normalizations typically apply methods that assume absence of global transcript shifts, or absence of changes in internal control features such as housekeeping genes. These normalization approaches are not appropriate for focused arrays with small sets of genes where a large portion may be expected to change. Furthermore, many microarrays lack control features that can be used for quality assurance (QA). Here, we describe a novel external control series integrated with a design feature that addresses the above issues. Results An EC dilution series that involves spike-in of a single concentration of the A. thaliana chlorophyll synthase gene to hybridize against spotted dilutions (0.000015 to 100 \u03bcM) of a single complimentary oligonucleotide representing the gene was developed. The EC series is printed in duplicate within each subgrid of the microarray and covers the full range of signal intensities from background to saturation. The design and placement of the series allows for QA examination of frequently encountered problems in hybridization (e.g., uneven hybridizations) and printing (e.g., cross-spot contamination). Additionally, we demonstrate that the series can be integrated with a LOWESS normalization to improve the detection of differential gene expression (improved sensitivity and predictivity) over LOWESS normalization on its own. Conclusion The quality of microarray experiments and the normalization methods used affect the ability to measure accurate changes in gene expression. Novel methods are required for normalization of small focused microarrays, and for incorporating measures of performance and quality. We demonstrate that dilution of oligonucleotides on the microarray itself provides an innovative approach allowing the full dynamic range of the scanner to be covered with a single gene spike-in. The dilution series can be used in a composite normalization to improve detection of differential gene expression and to provide quality control measures.",

                "High-density genomic tools, such as DNA microarrays, provide an important opportunity to study the global response of genomes to particular stressors or conditions. Unfortunately, commercially-available DNA microarrays exhibit several disadvantages when applied to toxicological investigations. For example, in toxicology, the lack of representation of toxicologically-relevant genes on commercial microarrays is an important problem. Statistical issues arising from existing commercial array designs present additional limitations for toxicogenomics experiments. On high-density commercial arrays, the thousands of genes that are not involved in toxic response pathways may remain relatively stable across exposures, thereby weakening the statistical power necessary to identify responsive elements of the genome [1]. Conversely, focused arrays that contain a limited number of features associated with particular biochemical pathways often lack technical and biological control features, such as gene replicates, quality assurance controls and/or normalization features, that are required for experiments in which a large proportion of genes may exhibit differential expression. A final impediment of commercial arrays in applications such as toxicogenomics is their high cost, which hinders the ability to conduct experiments with sufficient numbers of biological samples/replicates. As a result, the use of custom-made focused microarrays has become a popular alternative, allowing the study of genes relevant to a specific hypothesis.",
                "To address the limitations of commercial arrays in toxicogenomics investigations, we have developed a custom mouse oligonucleotide microarray, the HC ToxArray\u2122, which, by virtue of including genes that respond to a variety of chemical and physical stressors, is more relevant for toxicological studies. Furthermore, we have incorporated an extensive series of controls useful for both quality control and normalization of small focused arrays. Typical microarray analyses rely on normalization methods that assume absence of global transcript shifts, or that use internal control features such as housekeeping genes (e.g., [2]). These normalization approaches are not appropriate for focused arrays with small sets of genes [3,4]. Global unbalanced changes are expected due to small array size and gene selection based on pathways predicted to be involved in a particular response. Furthermore, chemical exposures or other parameters (e.g., phase of growth, developmental stage, tissue, disease, etc.) may affect the stability of housekeeping gene expression [5,6]. Therefore, innovative normalization methods are required for these focused arrays (e.g.,)[4,7-9]). The issue of performance measures and quality control standards must be addressed if microarrays are to be applied as tools in regulatory toxicology and risk assessment.",
                "In this study, we describe novel array design features that address the above issues. Specially positioned internal and external control (EC) series on ToxArray\u2122 were developed and characterized in order to eliminate the effects of these biological variables as well as reduce additional technical sources of variability, including uneven hybridization artifacts, minimal spot replication and print tip carryover. Sensitivity of the array spots to low-abundance RNA species was also estimated. Validation of the EC series for normalization and comparison with another common normalization strategy was achieved by determining the gene expression profile in mouse liver samples following treatment with the hepatotoxin phenobarbital."

As expected, hybridization of Universal Mouse Reference RNA (Stratagene) or B6C3F1 liver RNA did not result in detectable signal from any of the EC probe dilutions (data not shown). The spotted A. thaliana EC dilution series was designed to cover the full range of signal intensities obtained with murine-specific oligonucleotides on the ToxArray\u2122, from background levels to saturation (Figure 3, 4). Standard deviation of the log2(Cy5/Cy3) intensity ratios across the range of EC spike-in self vs. self hybridization results obtained in the presence of murine cRNA (Figure 4, black circles) was approximately 0.4 (log2), prior to normalization. In comparison to the EC spike-in result, a much larger variance was observed in the log2(Cy5/Cy3) intensity ratios typical of a B6C3F1 liver sample vs. Stratagene Universal Reference RNA hybridization result (Figure 4, green circles). The large variation in intensity ratios in the murine cRNA hybridizations were expected to occur due to widely varying abundances of specific mRNAs within these two very different murine RNA sources [10].",

Results from the on-slide dilution series were compared to results from a reciprocal dilution series of the spike-in reference cRNA made in solution. Hybridization of the spotted dilution series with mouse RNA containing a single spike-in concentration of the external reference RNA produced identical profiles of signal intensities compared to the signals obtained from multiple slides hybridized with serial spike-in dilutions of the external reference RNA (Figure 5)."

The smallest fraction tested, 0.0000005 (ng A. thaliana cRNA/ng mouse cRNA), gave significantly greater signal intensity than background from buffer-only spots located on the same slide (Figure 6).

For example, in initial experiments we detected differential hybridization from right to left and top to bottom of our early slides (Figure 7) that was related to the location on the slide relative to the port of injection of hybridization solution on the automated hybridization station. To some extent, the median of the four widely spaced replicate subgrids would normalize less severe systematic end-to-end and side-to-side variations in hybridization intensity that might be produced by automated hybridization station solution injection, since increased hybridization in one area would tend to be compensated by decreased hybridization in another. In the RNA profiling experiment reported in this work, hybridization results with similar defects were excluded, in favor of patterns with less overall difference in intensities across the slide (Figure 8)."

                        "All three types of negative controls (buffer-only, random 70 mer oligonucleotide pools and random hexamers) showed similar signal intensities within sub-grids indicating: 1) low background signal from the slide substrate and printing process, and 2) that the presence of non-specific oligonucleotides within a spot did not create hybridization artifacts (data not shown). The amount of print-tip carry-over of oligonucleotides from spot-to-spot during the printing-process was determined by considering the signal of buffer spots that were printed prior to (Spot A in Figure 1) and immediately following the saturated signal (Spot C1 through C3 in Figure 1) associated with the 100 \u03bcM A. thaliana oligonucleotide (Spot B in Figure 1). Percent cross-spot contamination was calculated by subtracting the signal of the buffer-only spot (Spot A) from the mean of spots printed immediately following a saturated signal (Spots C1 though C3), divided by the mean signal intensity of the saturated spot (Spots B1 though B3) minus the buffer-only background (Spot A) (i.e., [C-A]/[B-A] \u00d7 100, from Figure 1; grids are printed left to right). A plot showing a chip with a high proportion of cross-spot contamination for several print groups (groups 1, 2, 7 and 8) is shown in Figure 9. Using this measure, the average cross-spot contamination in the separately printed arrays of the PB RNA profiling experiment was 0.60% (\u00b1 0.02 standard error) and 0.67% (\u00b1 0.02 standard error) for Cy5 and Cy3 respectively.",
                        "Two additional estimations of carryover artifact amount and frequency could be made from other spot juxtapositions existing within each subgrid. In the first case, three 50 \u03bcM spots were printed prior to three random-70 mer oligonucleotide pool spots. This situation was directly comparable to most of the oligonucleotides representing murine genes, in that carryover from the first spot would be deposited into the following 40 \u03bcM spot, rather than buffer. Among arrays employed in the PB experiment described below, we found that the frequency of pins displaying carryover from 50 \u03bcM EC spots into the 70 mer pool spots was less (by 2 to 3-fold on a per-pin basis) than the estimate from the 100 \u03bcM spot analysis. By design, both 100 \u03bcM spots and the 50 \u03bcM EC spots gave hybridization signals that were near to, or fully saturated, thus providing optimal levels of signal to determine carryover. There was also a single RpL5 spot printed ahead of a buffer spot in each grid. RpL 5 usually also had very high signal levels that approached or reached signal saturation in most hybridizations, allowing another independent estimation of carryover. Only a single pin displayed carryover in the PB experiment. When measured with the 100 and 50 \u03bcM EC spots and RpL5 spot described above, that pin produced 2/3, 2/3, 0/1 individual spots with significant carryover (greater than 0.5% of signal), respectively."

Cy-labeled liver cRNA was hybridized against mouse reference cRNA (Stratagene), and MAANOVA was used to examine whether the ToxArray\u2122 could detect both expected and novel differential expression resulting from PB exposure. The first analysis employed a composite LOWESS normalization of microarray intensity values. This approach calculated a LOWESS normalization of the median values of all data in each print-tip group in addition to a LOWESS normalization of the chip EC titration series. A normalization constant that combined these two into an intensity-dependent, weighted average was used [8]. We found a total of 35 genes that were differentially expressed (p < 0.05 using the James-Stein Shrinkage F-Test [12] adjusted for the False Discovery Rate (FDR); Table 1) with respect to the overall treatment effect. These p-values obtained from the Fs-Statistic were estimated using 1000 permutations with residual shuffling. Pairwise comparisons showed that 16 of these genes expressed differential abundances of RNA at the highest dose of PB (100 mg/kg), while 4 were found to be differential at the 10 mg/ml dose. No genes were identified as differentially expressed in pairwise comparisons at the 1 mg/kg dose, nor at the lowest dose (0.1 mg/kg, not shown).",

The union of the two lists consisted of 27 probes, with a total of 31 pairwise comparisons. Two additional probes (Anpep, Cyp2a4; giving four additional pairwise comparisons) were also included, since earlier statistical calculations (1000 permutations with residual shuffling) had indicated both significant pairwise comparisons and overall effects, but these values were not confirmed in the analyses presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Additional RT-PCR analyses were done using RNA samples which gave microarray results (6 probes with 8 pairwise comparisons) that were in agreement between the EC and without EC analyses (Table 3). All six microarray probe results were confirmed to be correct, although two pairwise comparisons for two of the probes conflicted with the RT-PCR results. Results from the RT-PCR were used to determine the true positives, false negatives, false positives and true negatives, and to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and the efficiency of the normalization methods (Tables 4 and 5).

However, several other genes identified in common by the 4-spot analysis were partitioned into one of the two single-spot analyses: four of eight genes specific to the non-EC single-spot normalization (Gsta4, Rbp1, gstm2, Ephx1) and two of five genes specific to the single-spot EC normalization (Rbp1, AhR). Thus, approximately half of the genes found in common from the 4-spot analyses were found by either single spot analysis. Smaller proportions of genes specific to either normalization in the 4-spot analysis were found to be differential by the single spot analyses: 2/15 for non-EC (Gsta2 Ugt1a6) and 2/11 for EC (Keap1, Bhmt). One gene specific to the single-spot EC normalization and two genes specific to the single-spot non-EC normalization were not identified by the respective 4-spot analyses, reducing the proportion of genes found by the single spot analyses to 0.34 and 0.36 for EC and non-EC, respectively, in this comparison of spot replication effect."

                "Appropriate quality controls and protocols for assessment of printing and hybridization in microarray experiments are crucial for ensuring high-quality data and establishing performance standards. Despite this, controls used for specifically addressing these issues are rarely reported in microarray publications. In addition, the development of features for normalization within, and between arrays is critical for all microarray applications, and is particularly relevant to the application of small focused arrays where a relatively large portion of the pathways may show changes in gene expression.",
                "We developed an EC dilution series using the spike-in of a single Arabidopsis chlorophyll synthase gene hybridized to a series of dilutions of the complementary oligonucleotide printed on the microarray. In contrast with other external spike-in procedures that use a mixture of varying amounts of different control RNAs spiked into total RNA to derive signals across a range of intensities (e.g., [4]), our approach maintains a constant single input of external RNA, while varying the dilution of the EC oligonucleotide on the slide itself. This simple and flexible method allows a more robust quantitation of the spike-in compared to other methods. In addition, the EC series was designed to cover the full range of signal intensities (with no gaps) over the ToxArray\u2122, reaching both background and saturated intensities (Figures 3, 4 and 5). The array incorporates a design that allows the use of the ECs, in combination with negative control spots, for detection of several technical problems that may arise in the printing, hybridization or scanning of a microarray, permitting correction or exclusion during subsequent analyses. Differential intensities of dye fluorescence on microarrays may arise from factors related to physical or chemical properties, differences in the efficiency of incorporation during probe synthesis and as a result of variations in scanner operation. These EC features can be applied in combination with LOWESS to normalize such systematic effects. Dye bias due to differential hybridization that, in part, may result from concentration-dependent effects within or between target cRNA populations and array spots that might arise during hybridization and washing procedures, may also be subject to this type of normalization. In this regard, it has been shown that tethered nucleic acid probes can behave differently depending on the nature of their supports [13], but here it was shown that the hybridization pattern derived from dilution of the EC oligonucleotide on the ToxArray\u2122 slide surface was a close mimic of the pattern of hybridization resulting from similar dilutions of labeled cRNA in solution. A close relationship between these two concentration vs. intensity curves permits subsequent normalization adjustments of variations in murine cRNA hybridization intensity ratios, without introducing large errors. Composite LOWESS adjustments across the range of EC intensities on each array would be likely to represent similar differences in concentration-dependent hybridization amounts of murine genes, across samples.",
                "Subtle unequal hybridization resulting in spatial patterning in dye fluorescence across an array might be undetected by visually examining the arrays, but may be revealed by the presence of increased variances of Cy3/Cy5 ratios among the 48 EC replicates and four gene replicates of each grid. EC features might also be used to control positional and slide-to-slide hybridization effects that are more erratic, such as those resulting from exclusion by bubbles, by taking an average of the ECs within a subgrid, dividing each spot within the subgrid by the EC average, followed by multiplication of each spot by an overall slide average using the external controls. This would be done for each channel separately. Further refinements in normalization can be envisioned that would employ attributes of the EC hybridization curve, other than its average value. A systematic examination of these alternate approaches has not yet been made.",
                "The limited sequence homology of the A. thaliana oligonucleotide among the genomes of organisms with published sequence information, suggests possible applications to gene expression studies in a wide variety of organisms. Since oligonucleotide probes designed with constraints on length, G+C% and secondary structure produce similar, parallel hybridization values over large cRNA concentration ranges [14], the choice of oligonucleotide used to produce an EC series in the manner we have described is not necessarily restricted to the sequence employed in the present experiments.",
                "The placement of negative control features within the ToxArray\u2122 design is an innovative approach to allow for the evaluation of cross-spot contamination during the printing process. Negative controls following either a saturated signal or a buffer spot were used to demonstrate the carry-over of oligonucleotides within print-tip groups in a print-run (Figure 9) (this is a frequent problem in microarray printing that is rarely mentioned or quantified) [15]. Carry-over can significantly impact analysis of differential expression if low intensity spots are printed following spots that vary in intensity and occasionally show high signals. Similarly, carryover effects would degrade the usefulness of the EC series. Each print-run should be evaluated to ensure that this effect is minimized, especially with the (demonstrated) high fractional sensitivity of the Toxarray\u2122 (1/2,000,000 transcripts). The knowledge of cross-spot contamination could be incorporated into the selection of genes for RT-PCR confirmation and final analysis of differential gene expression, or print tip groups with unacceptable levels could be removed from the analysis.",
                "Lastly, the ToxArray\u2122 incorporates 4 replicates of each oligonucleotide spot distributed into separate subgrids on each slide. This degree and placement of spot replication can significantly increase the reliability of fluorescence measurements of gene expression levels [11,16] and would thereby decrease variability of two-color ratios. Indeed, fewer genes were identified as differentially expressed based upon single oligonucleotide spots as compared to the four replicates in this study.",
                "We exposed mice to a known hepatotoxin to test the hypothesis that global normalization approaches for focused microarrays will generate a higher proportion of false findings, relative to an approach using external features. Composite normalization incorporating the EC features (described in methods) resulted in a list of 36 genes with adjusted p-values less than 0.05. The predominant pathways represented among the genes that were differentially expressed included stress response, growth differentiation, apoptosis and xenobiotic metabolism. Among the latter, cyp2b10, cyp2b9, Gsta2 and Ephx1 were validated by RT-PCR. The induction of these pathways is consistent with the known pathologic effects of PB. This response was employed to provide confirmation, when verified by RT-PCR, that the composite normalization would score higher, as expected, on all measures of effectiveness, compared to the global normalization approach.",
                "We expect the composite normalization to be even more superior in experiments where larger portions of genes are responsive. Although PB was an effective modifier of gene expression in this study of murine liver, only about 40 genes of the total 1600 on ToxArray\u2122 might have been categorized by RT-PCR as significant responders, predicting from the existing microarray data and the observed frequencies of RT-PCR confirmation. This was a small proportion (2.5%) of genes represented on the array. Increased numbers of responding genes might have been expected, given higher PB doses or a longer treatment period.",
                "The relatively greater effectiveness of the EC composite normalization approach has also been found in a complementary study examining murine liver response to polychlorinated biphenyl exposure, in which 22 genes were validated using RT-PCR (data not shown \u2013 to be published elsewhere). The summary statistics presented in this study should be interpreted with care as there was some potential for selection bias in the choices made for RT-PCR validation among the genes identified as differential by both normalization procedures. However, we are currently carrying out additional RT-PCR experiments with other microarray datasets to achieve more representative estimates."

                "We demonstrate the application of a simple external control dilution series, in combination with a novel DNA array design, to yield improved detection of differential gene expression and provide quality control measures. The appropriate placement of controls and replication of probe spots allows for quantification of positional hybridization effects and cross-spot contamination. The application of a composite normalization, which incorporates an external control dilution series, results in an improvement in the sensitivity and predictivity of the test, as well as a minimization in false positive detection. Dilution of oligonucleotides on the microarray itself provides an innovative approach allowing the full dynamic range of the scanner to be covered with a single gene spike-in."

Mouse genes (and homologues of rat and human genes) shown to be useful in toxicant-specific profiling were included [4,17-19]. Additionally, a large fraction of murine genes known to be involved in DNA repair, as well as the mouse cytochrome p450 family, were included. Our current list includes approximately 1600 genes known to respond to a wide range of toxic stressors. Approximately 50 housekeeping genes have been included on the array.

                        "The ToxArray\u2122 consists of 12 sub-grids (16 rows \u00d7 12 columns) printed in quadruplicate (for a total of 48 sub-grids). External control (EC) normalization features are present in every sub-grid and consist of a series of 18 dilutions of a single probe corresponding to the Arabidopsis thaliana chlorophyll synthase gene (RefSeq NM_115041). The dilution series of the probe is prepared in ArrayIT spotting solution (Telechem International, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (concentrations range from 0.000015 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM). Each EC probe dilution is printed at least twice per sub-grid (42 EC features per sub-grid) for a total of more than 2000 EC features across the space of the entire array. Each sub-grid also contains three types of negative controls including: buffer-only spots, randomized pools of non-specific 70 mer oligonucleotides (Qiagen Inc.; validated to ensure that they do not match any known mouse genes), and random hexamers (Qiagen, Inc.) in ArrayIT buffer (Figure 1). The latter two negative controls are useful to detect background resulting from fluorescence signal from oligonucleotides or random non-specific binding. Within each sub-grid, placement of one buffer control (Spots C; Figure 1) immediately follows the printing of a 100 \u03bcM EC oligonucleotide (Spots B; Figure 1). The 100 \u03bcM signal reaches saturation; juxtaposition of the buffer control spot immediately following the saturated control allows the calculation of cross-spot contamination, or carry-over of oligonucleotides across individual spots by the printing pin. Cross-spot contamination was evaluated by comparing the signal from spots C, to a buffer-only spot within the same sub-grid that is printed immediately following another buffer-only spot (Spot A; Figure 1).",

To optimize the dynamic range of microarrays and allow the quantification of both high and low copy expressed genes, the same arrays were scanned using different photomultiplier settings allowing selection of images with saturated image intensities on the 50 and 100 \u03bcM EC spots and on oligonucleotide spots for high-abundance genes such as Rpl5. Raw pixel intensities were derived in ImaGene 5.6 (BioDiscovery, Los Angeles, CA) and median signal intensities (not background subtracted) were used for subsequent analyses. Obtained data conformed to the suggested average [log2(Cy3*Cy5)/2 of 10 to 12 (1024 to 4096 RFUs) [20]. Data is available through ArrayExpress [21]. Present calls were determined as signals that were greater than the mean of the random 70 mer oligonucleotide negative controls plus three times the standard deviation (signals within the range of three standard deviations were flagged). Data from all samples were read into SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). The data were normalized using the composite LOWESS method [8] which takes a weighted average from a LOWESS fit using only the ECs with a span of 0.3, and a second LOWESS fit for each of the 12 print-tip groups with a span of 0.5. Technical replicates on arrays were collapsed by use of the median normalized relative intensity. For comparison, a second normalization was carried out on PB samples using a LOWESS with a smooth span of 0.4 without incorporation of ECs. The MAANOVA 2.0 [22] library in R was used for graphical displays and analysis. Ratio-intensity plots for each array were obtained. Higher-level statistical analysis, including detection of differential expression was also conducted using MAANOVA methodology [1,23]."
