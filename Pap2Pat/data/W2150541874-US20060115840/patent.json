    "abstract": "An array in which an external control feature for normalization has been designed and tested for its ability to mimic the range of observed expression levels for a test set of oligos. The external control probes span a series of concentrations. They are spatially randomized across a grid of an array. The series of concentrations is duplicated in a given grid. The individual grid layout and number of control and external normalization features per grid have been designed to cope with sources of both systematic error and spatial variation.",

                        "The present invention is related to the field of arrays more specifically to array systems.",
                        "2. Description of the Related Art",
                        "DNA arrays are commonly used to make quantitative or relative measurements of gene expression. They provide a medium for matching known and unknown DNA samples based on base-pairing rules and automating the process of identifying the unknowns. In general, arrays are described as macroarrays or microarrays, the difference being the size of the sample spots. Macroarrays contain sample spot sizes of about 300 microns or larger and can be easily imaged by existing gel and blot scanners. The sample spot sizes in microarrays are typically less than 200 microns in diameter and these arrays usually contain thousands of spots.",
                        "The microarrays contain nucleotide sequences corresponding to known genes or expressed sequence tags. A single microarray can contain thousands of genes, which may represent a significant subset of the genes, or even the entire genome, of an organism. A comparison of cells or tissues from experimental and control preparations provides data on differences in expression levels between the two conditions. For this purpose, mRNA is extracted from a sample, converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) and tagged with a fluorescent label. In a typical microarray experiment, cDNA from one sample (sample A) is labeled with a first dye that fluoresces in the red and cDNA from another sample (sample B) is labeled with a different dye that fluoresces in the green. The fluorescent red and green cDNA samples are then applied to a microarray that contains DNA fragments (oligonucleotides) corresponding to thousands of genes. If a DNA sequence probe is present on the microarray and its target complement is present in one or both samples, the sequences bind, and a fluorescent signal can be detected at the specific spot on the array. The signals are generally picked up using a \u201cscanner\u201d which creates a digital image of the array. The red to green fluorescence ratio in each spot reflects the relative expression of a given gene in the samples A and B.",
                        "Current microarray analyses rely on normalization and quality control methods that often assume evenly distributed changes, and/or absence of global shifts in gene expression across the array surface. Spotted microarray features such as housekeeping genes, sample pools, genomic DNA, or all genes on a microarray are typically used for normalization. Normalization based on these features is not always appropriate, especially for smaller focussed arrays (versus whole genome microarrays) where unbalanced changes are likely to occur, and will have significant effects on the relative hybridization signal intensities between biological samples. As a result, normalization based on such features will give rise to inaccurate interpretations of gene expression data.",
                        "According to WO2004/064482, normalization and quality assessment of microarray data, where unbalanced gene expression is anticipated, can be accomplished by the addition of several different external, non-species nucleic acid targets of different concentrations into the RNA sample of interest prior to labelling and hybridization. Different concentrations of external control targets are chosen to mimic a broad range of expression profiles. Probes complimentary to the external targets are printed at equivalent concentrations on the microarray. Variation between external control target concentrations in the sample results in different fluorescence intensities detected for each external control probe. Since detection of the different external controls will be equivalent between RNA samples, and are not affected by unbalanced or global shifts in gene expression within the RNA sample of interest, they can be used for accurate normalization and interpretation of gene expression data from focussed microarrays.",
                        "The drawback to using an external control, where varying amounts of different targets are added to the RNA sample of interest, is that it requires accurate measurement of extremely small quantities of those several RNA targets at low concentrations. The technical error associated with measurements at the low range required for microarray analysis results in unacceptable variation between samples that will have a significant influence on normalization and interpretation of gene expression data. In addition, the optimization and preparation of multiple external control targets and probes is time-consuming and costly.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need for a microarray system that allows for more accuracy in the normalization of the data."

The dilution of a control probe in situ (i.e. printed on the hybridization surface in different concentrations) effectively mimics a broad range of expression profiles. This approach allows an experimenter to apply at least one external control target spiked into RNA or protein samples reducing the preparation time a cost normally associated with the development and use of external controls.",
                        "Variation in the amount of printed probe will result in variation of the amount of hybridized external control target resulting in the detection of a broad range of hybridization signal intensities. Since the amount of external control target added to each biological sample is equivalent, and unaffected by unbalanced or global shifts in expression within the sample, detection of the external control will be equivalent across all samples. These external control features can then be utilized for normalization, quality control, validation or other applications.",
                        "The addition of a constant and an accurately measurable quantity of external control target to each biological sample prior to labelling and hybridization, combined with the printing of several different concentrations of the external control probe covering the dynamic range of signal detection, represents a novel approach to microarray normalization, quality control, validation and other applications that is unaffected by unbalanced or global shifts in gene expression.",

As is well known to those skilled in the art, for the hybridization characteristics to be similar across a wide range of oligonucleotides, it is typically required that the probes on the array be of the substantially same length, have a similar percentage of Guanine to Cytosine content and lack any extensive runs of poly A, poly G, poly C, or poly T tracts. The goal of controlling these parameters is to produce probes that have similar melting and hybridization temperatures. Additionally, these probes should, preferably, lack length complementary regions and not form hairpin structures. The probe can be DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides, cDNA, proteins or antibodies.",

Numerous fluorescent dyes of a wide variety of structures and characteristics are suitable for use in the practice of this invention. Similarly, methods and materials are known in the art for fluorescently labelling nucleic acids (see, for example, R. P. Haugland, \u201cMolecular Probes: Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals 1992-1994\u201d, Sti' Ed., 1994, Molecular Probes, Inc.). In choosing a fluorophore, it is generally preferred that the fluorescent molecule absorbs light and emits fluorescence with high efficiency (i.e., it has a high molar absorption coefficient and a high fluorescence quantum yield, respectively), and is photostable (i.e. it does not undergo significant degradation upon light excitation within the time necessary to perform the array-based hybridization). Suitable fluorescent labels for use in the practice of the methods of the invention include, for example, Cy-3, Cy-5, Texas red, FITC, Spectrum Red, Spectrum Green, Alexa-488, phycoerythrin, rhodamine, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanine, carbocyanine, merocyanine, styryl dye, oxonol dye, BODIPY dye, and equivalents, analogues or derivatives of these molecules.",

A discrete spot may contain a single nucleic acid molecule or a mixture of different nucleic acid molecules. Spots on an array may be arranged on the support surface at different densities. In general, microarrays with probe pitch smaller than 500 pm (i.e., density larger than 400 probes per cm2) are referred to as high density microarrays, otherwise, they are called low density microarrays. Arrays come as two-dimensional probe matrices (or supports), which can be solid or porous, planar or non-planar, unitary or distributed.
