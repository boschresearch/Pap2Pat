    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels, NaVs, are responsible for the rapid rise of action potentials in excitable tissues. NaV channel mutations have been implicated in several human genetic diseases, such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis, myotonia, and long-QT and Brugada syndromes. Here, we generated high-affinity anti-NaV nanobodies (Nbs), Nb17 and Nb82, that recognize the NaV1.4 (skeletal muscle) and NaV1.5 (cardiac muscle) channel isoforms. These Nbs were raised in llama (Lama glama) and selected from a phage display library for high affinity to the C-terminal (CT) region of NaV1.4. The Nbs were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and biophysically characterized. Development of high-affinity Nbs specifically targeting a given human NaV isoform has been challenging because they usually show undesired crossreactivity for different NaV isoforms. Our results show, however, that Nb17 and Nb82 recognize the CTNaV1.4 or CTNaV1.5 over other CTNav isoforms. Kinetic experiments by biolayer interferometry determined that Nb17 and Nb82 bind to the CTNaV1.4 and CTNaV1.5 with high affinity (KD \u223c 40-60 nM). In addition, as proof of concept, we show that Nb82 could detect NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 channels in mammalian cells and tissues by Western blot. Furthermore, human embryonic kidney cells expressing holo NaV1.5 channels demonstrated a robust FRET-binding efficiency for Nb17 and Nb82. Our work lays the foundation for developing Nbs as anti-NaV reagents to capture NaVs from cell lysates and as molecular visualization agents for NaVs.",

                        "To facilitate the selection of Nbs with isoform specificity, we analyzed the homology amongst NaV isoforms to choose a divergent region. Sequence homology analysis amongst the NaV isoforms revealed that the linker between domains 1 and 2 (1\u20132 linker, amino acids 481\u2013581 in NaV1.4) is the most divergent with pairwise identity between 40 and 55%, whereas the CTNaV (1599\u20131836 amino acids in NaV1.4) domain displays pairwise identity of 60 to 70% (Table\u00a0S1). The fact that CTNaV\u2013calmodulin (CaM) is known to fold as a globular domain that can be purified and crystallized (28, 29) cemented the CTNaV domain in complex with CaM (CTNaV\u2013CaM) as the antigen of choice. To generate, select, and produce the Nbs (Fig.\u00a01), a llama was immunized with purified CTNaV1.4T in complex with CaM (CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM, amino acids 1599\u20131764 CTNaV1.4T, Table\u00a0S2 and Fig.\u00a01, step 1 and 2), and its humoral immune response was evaluated by ELISA (Figs.\u00a0S1A and 1, steps 3 and 4) (29). mRNA was extracted from isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs; Fig.\u00a01, step 4) and PCR amplified (Fig.\u00a01, step 5). The VHH complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned into a phagemid vector pHEN4 to obtain the VHH phage library (Fig.\u00a01, step 6).Figure\u00a01Scheme describing the steps used for the selection of high-affinity nanobodies (Nbs) specific for voltage-gated sodium channels. Step 1: Production of CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM to use as antigen. Step 2: Llama immunization with CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM. Step 3: Collection of immune sera from llama on day 35 and day 40 postimmunization. Step 4: Isolation of lymphocytes to extract total RNA. Step 5: RT\u2013PCR to obtain complementary DNA of VHH domains. Step 6: Cloning of VHH complementary DNA (750\u00a0bp) into Escherichia coli shuttle vector for phage display. Step 7: Phage display for selection of Nbs against CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM in M13 phage. Step 8: Screening phage library by ELISA for high-binding Nb clones. Step 9: Cloning in pHEN6 vector and purification of selected Nb clones (Nb17, Nb30, and Nb82) in E.\u00a0coli. Step 10: Crystallization of Nb82 using commercially available sparsematrix screens. Step 11: Characterization of Nb binding to NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 isoforms.

                        "To identify Nbs that target CTNaV1.4\u2013CaMs, we screened an Nb phage display library with an estimated complexity of >5.6\u00a0\u00d7 107 clones (Fig.\u00a01, step 7). Following two rounds of positive selection against CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM, a total of 87 randomly chosen clones were expressed and tested by ELISA (Fig.\u00a01, step 8). Amongst them, 14 clones were found specific to CTNaV1.4\u2013CaM (Fig.\u00a0S1B). We further classified the 14 clones into four different families based on the length and variability of their CDR2 and CDR3 regions (Fig.\u00a0S1C). One representative clone from each family was chosen and screened by periplasmic ELISA against CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM, Ca2+ CaM, and apoCaM proteins (Fig.\u00a02A). Of these, Nb17, Nb30, and Nb82 were found to be specific to CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM (\u201c+\u201d signs) but not to Ca2+ CaM or apo-CaM. However, Nb26 recognized not only CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM but also Ca2+ CaM and apo-CaM. Based on this information, Nb17, Nb30, and Nb82 were chosen for expression and purification in Escherichia coli for further biophysical and biochemical characterization. The three selected Nb clones were subcloned into a pHEN6-His vector as a CT 6\u00d7-His tagged fusion protein and successfully expressed in the periplasm of E.\u00a0coli Rosetta-gami 2(DE3) cells. The Nbs were extracted from the periplasm using a combination of thermal and osmotic shock methods (30). Of these, Nb30 was not pursued further because of its low expression levels. Nb17 and Nb82 were purified via nickel\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni\u2013NTA) chromatography, followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC; Figs.1, step 9 and 2, B\u2013D). Both Nbs behave as monomers in solution and were detected as a single homogenous peak on SEC with retention volumes of 14.4\u00a0ml (Nb17) and 15.6\u00a0ml (Nb82) on a Superdex 75 10/300\u00a0GL column (Fig.\u00a02D). These retention volumes are in agreement with those of Nbs reported in the literature (31, 32).Figure\u00a02Identification of nanobodies (Nbs) specific for NaV1.4.A, ELISA of the periplasmic extract using positively selected clones. Absorbances higher than 2 (orange dashed line) were considered positive. \u201c+\u201d signs over Nb17, Nb30, and Nb82 indicate that they are specific to CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM but not to Ca2+ CaM or apo-CaM.

Nb17 is characterized by a Tm of 76 \u00b0C (Fig.\u00a03A) and Nb82 by a Tm of 66 \u00b0C (Fig.\u00a03B), suggesting both are relatively stable protein suitable for functional and structural characterization. Notably, Nb17 undergoes reversible temperature denaturation, whereas Nb82 undergoes irreversible denaturation. The different denaturation mechanisms probably originate from sequence differences. These different mechanisms are also reflected in the shape of the DSC curves (33). Also, Nb17 has a van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy of 118\u00a0kcal/mol that is close to what is expected for a protein of this size undergoing two-state unfolding. For Nb82, the irreversible transition is kinetically controlled, with a noticeable change in shape of the curve, and characterized by an activation energy of 86\u00a0kcal/mol.Figure\u00a03Nanobody (Nb) thermal stability and crystal structure of Nb82.A, DSC curve showing the temperature denaturation of Nb17 undergoing reversible denaturation with Tm centered at 75.8 \u00b0C.

                        "The structure of Nb82 was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 0.19/0.24 with excellent geometry (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 7R63; Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a03, C\u2013F). The asymmetric unit includes four copies of Nb82 with almost identical conformations (C\u03b1 RMSD <0.30\u00a0\u00c5, pairwise among all four chains, including 117\u00a0C\u03b1 carbons). Nb82 bears the classical immunoglobulin fold (Fig.\u00a03, C and D) with two \u03b2-sheets of four antiparallel \u03b2-strands (\u03b21\u2013\u03b23\u2013\u03b28\u2013\u03b27 and \u03b26\u2013\u03b25\u2013\u03b24\u2013\u03b29) and a smaller \u03b2-sheet made up of two parallel \u03b2-strands, \u03b22 and \u03b210, that elongate the \u03b26\u2013\u03b25\u2013\u03b24\u2013\u03b29 sheet. The structure displays good electron density for all portions of the four molecules (Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a03, C and D). The fold is decorated by three \u03c0-helices, two of which are in the epitope-recognizing CDR1 and CDR3, formed between the \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 and \u03b29\u2013\u03b210 loops, respectively. The third \u03c0-helix is on the loop connecting strands \u03b23 and \u03b24. CDR \u03c0-helices are a characteristic feature observed in other Nbs (14). CDR3, the usual major contributor for antigen recognition and specificity, folds as a random coil with a \u03c0-helix of seven residues that folds back onto \u03b26\u2013\u03b25\u2013\u03b24\u2013\u03b29 sheet. Notably, the CDR1 and CDR2 present a positively charged patch (Fig.\u00a03, E and F) suggesting that Nb82 favors an interaction with a large negatively charged surface on the NaV.

We used a truncated (T) or full-length (FL) construct of the CTNaV isoforms (Fig.\u00a04B). In ELISA experiments, Nb82 and Nb17 recognize both the T and FL versions of both CTNaV1.4\u2013CaM (skeletal) and CTNaV1.5\u2013CaM (cardiac). However, they do not recognize neuronal isoforms, CTNaV1.7\u2013CaM or CTNaV1.9 (Fig.\u00a04A).

On the other hand, no signal was detected for purified CTNaV1.7, CTNaV1.9, CaM alone, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (Fig.\u00a05A), suggesting that Nb82 is specific to NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 channels.Figure\u00a05Selectivity of Nb17 and Nb82 in detecting NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 channels.A, Western blot of purified CTNaV\u2013CaM proteins, CaM alone, and Nb17-His, Nb82-His, CaM, and GST alone showing positive signals for CTNaV1.4T/FL (1.4T/1.4FL), CTNaV1.5T/FL (1.5T/1.5FL), and Nb17, Nb82-His and Nb82-StrepII (Nb82S). No signal is observed in the lanes that contained CTNaV1.7T/FL and CTNaV1.9T/FL suggesting that Nb82 does not recognize these two isoforms. Western blot was developed using Nb82-His as primary antibody and anti-HisHRP antibody as secondary. All Western blot data show one representative experiment of three. CTNaV\u2013CaM proteins are labeled CTNaV1.xT (1.xT) and CTNaV1.xFL (1.xFL).

We engineered Nb17 and Nb82 with a Cerulean fluorescent protein as a FRET donor and the CT domains of NaV1.x with the Venus fluorescent protein, as FRET acceptor. Stochastic expression of the FRET pairs resulted in variable FRET efficiencies (EA) in individual cells. A saturating binding relation was then constructed by correlating EA with the free donor concentration (Dfree). Nb82 and Nb17 exhibited robust FRET with CTNaV1.4 and CTNaV1.5, whereas other isoforms showed qualitatively weaker FRET (Fig.\u00a05, B and D). To quantify further, we calculated a relative association constant, Ka,EFF (in arbitrary units) as 1/Kd,EFF (the relative dissociation constant) from the fits in panels B and D. Indeed, both Nb17 and Nb82 demonstrated 7-fold to 100-fold higher Ka,EFF for NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 as compared with other NaV isoforms (Fig.\u00a05, C and E). Taken together, these results highlight the exquisite selectivity of Nb17 and Nb82 for the muscle NaV channels.",

                        "We further probed the molecular interactions of the CTNaV1.4\u2013CaM\u00a0+ Nb and CTNaV1.5\u2013CaM\u00a0+ Nb ([CTNaVX]\u2013CaM\u00a0+ Nb; X\u00a0= 1.4 or 1.5) complexes by determining the kinetic parameters of binding using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Figs.\u00a07 and 8). The change in resonance with time was recorded at different concentrations of purified CTNaV1.XT\u2013CaM proteins or isolated CaM. A 1:1 binding of the Nbs to CTNaVXT\u2013CaM proteins was observed with signals reaching steady state in 300\u00a0s. Analysis of the BLI dose responses of association and dissociation curves indicates that Nb82 binds to CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM and CTNaV1.5T\u2013CaM with affinities of 50.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.1 and 63.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.07\u00a0nM, respectively (Fig.\u00a07, A and B and Table\u00a02). However, no binding to Nb82 was observed when isolated CaM was used as an analyte (Fig.\u00a07C) evidenced by a nonassociation/no-binding curve. In addition, as estimated from ELISA results, no binding to Nb82 was observed when CTNaV1.7T\u2013CaM or CTNaV1.9T were used as analytes (Fig.\u00a07, D and E). Similarly, with Nb17 (Fig.\u00a08, A and B), BLI experiments show that it binds to CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM and CTNaV1.5T\u2013CaM with dissociation constants (KDs) of 41.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.1\u00a0nM and 60.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.06\u00a0nM, respectively (Table\u00a02 and Fig.\u00a08C) but not to isolated CaM. Moreover, as expected, no binding to Nb17 was observed when CTNaV1.7T\u2013CaM or CTNaV1.9T was used as analytes (Fig.\u00a08, D and E). In these experiments, the lack of binding of Nb17 and Nb82 to isolated CaM and to CTNaV1.7\u2013CaM and CTNaV1.9 indicates that the epitope for Nb82 binding is on the NaV1.4(5) channels or on the NaV1.4(5)\u2013CaM interface in an area different enough from that of NaV17 or NaV1.9.Figure\u00a07Nb82 binds to CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM and CTNaV1.5T\u2013CaM with nanomolar affinity.A, BLI sensorgram of Nb82 titrated with CTNaV1.4T\u2013CaM at concentrations 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0nM plotted as nanometer shift with time.

To do so, we utilized Cerulean-tagged Nb17 and Nb82 as FRET donor, and we attached a Venus tag to the carboxy terminus of the FL NaV1.5 (FRET acceptor) (Fig.\u00a09A) and obtained fluorescence measurements using a flow cytometer. Stochastic expression of the FRET pairs resulted in variable FRET efficiencies (EA) in individual cells. A saturating binding relation was then constructed by correlating EA with the free donor concentration (Dfree). We observed robust FRET for both Nb17 (Fig.\u00a09B) and Nb82 (Fig.\u00a09C) with NaV1.5 confirming baseline association of the heterologously expressed Nb in live cells. By contrast, coexpression of Cerulean alone with NaV1.5 did not show appreciable FRET (Fig.\u00a09D). These findings demonstrate the robust interaction of Nb17 and Nb82 with NaV1.5 in live cells, thus furnishing a new avenue to probe and manipulate NaV channels in physiology.Figure\u00a09Nanobodies (Nbs) as tools to detect NaVchannels from live cells and tissue homogenates.A, schematic of FRET two-hybrid assay to probe live-cell binding of Nbs to holo-NaV1.5 channels.

His-tagged Nb82 detects NaV1.4 in mouse skeletal muscle homogenates in addition to NaV1.5 in mouse heart homogenates as shown by a band at \u223c220\u00a0kDa. Notably, Nb82 does not detect NaVs in brain tissue (Fig.\u00a09E). The Western blot signal detected by the His-tagged Nb82 (Fig.\u00a09E) is comparable to that detected by a commercially available anti-Pan NaV Ab (Fig.\u00a09F) as observed by signals corresponding to the same molecular weight for skeletal muscle and heart tissue samples in both blots. Moreover, the anti-Pan Nav Ab detects a band at \u223c250\u00a0kDa in mouse brain tissue (Fig.\u00a09F) that is not observed with the Nb82 detection. Also, Nb82 detects Nav1.5 from human induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC\u2013CMs) differentiated from normal hiPSCs as observed by a band at \u223c220\u00a0kDa (Fig.\u00a09H). As a control, when the blots were reprobed with simply anti-His horseradish peroxidase (HRP) Ab (Fig.\u00a09,G and I), no bands were observed at 220 to 250\u00a0kDa showing the specificity of detection by Nb82 as expected."

                "This study describes the generation and characterization of two Nbs, Nb17 and Nb82, that recognize and bind to the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.4 and NaV1.5 isoforms. The Nbs do not recognize isolated CaM, NaV1.7, or NaV1.9 channels showing their specificity for the NaV muscle isoform, NaV1.4(5). Both Nbs have structural stabilities similar to those observed for other globular proteins. According to the survey of Robertson and Murphy (35), the average Tm for globular proteins is approximately 68 \u00b0C compared with the Tms of 76 and 66 \u00b0C for Nb17 and Nb82, respectively. Also, according to the survey of Robertson and Murphy, the mean enthalpy for a protein of 15\u00a0kDa at 70 \u00b0C is 115\u00a0kcal/mol, which is close to the van\u2019t Hoff enthalpy of Nb17 suggesting structuring interactions similar to those observed for other proteins. The denaturation transition of Nb82 is irreversible at pH 8.0, which is not unseen for other proteins (36) that nevertheless undergo reversible denaturation at lower pH values.",
                "The crystal structure of Nb82 reveals a long (15 amino acids) CDR3 for a llama-derived Nb that could possibly underlie the nanomolar binding affinities observed for the Nbs to NaV1.4 and NaV1.5.",
                "Nb82 promises to be a high-affinity NaV1.4(5) protein detection reagent. Our SEC experiments demonstrate formation of stable CTNaV1.4(5)\u2013CaM\u00a0+ Nb complexes. Importantly, binding kinetic experiments by BLI show nanomolar binding affinities for the Nbs to CTNaV1.4\u2013CaM and CTNaV1.5\u2013CaM proteins and no binding to CaM or CTNaV1.7\u2013CaM and CTNaV1.9 proteins. Furthermore, flow-cytometric FRET measurements in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing FL NaV1.5 channel display high efficiency of binding of Nb17 and Nb82 to NaV1.5 channels on the cell surface but no binding to CaM-expressing cells. In HEK293\u00a0cells expressing CTNaV1.4 or CTNaV1.5 isoforms, flow-cytometric FRET measurements show binding to Nb17 or Nb82. In contrast, cells expressing any of the other CTNaV1.x isoforms displayed negligible binding. We further demonstrate that Nb82 can be used as a molecular reagent to detect NaV1.4(5) proteins in various types of cell and tissue lysates since it recognizes endogenous NaV1.4 channel from mammalian skeletal muscle in addition to NaV1.5 from mammalian heart and hiPSC\u2013CMs.",
                "Nbs have been selected for other voltage-gated channel\u2013related subunits. For instance, the auxillary subunit of CaV channel, Cav\u03b2, has been targeted to design a potent genetically encoded high-voltage\u2013activated calcium channel inhibitor (37). It is worth highlighting that the anti-NaV1.4 and anti-NaV1.5 Nbs produced as part of this study carry a simple CT 6\u00d7Histidine tag, ensuring ease of production and scale up of anti-NaV Nbs to serve as NaV detection reagents, crystallization chaperones, and as in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo research tools and molecular probes."

                                "CT regions of NaV1.4(UniProtKb:P35499), NaV1.5 (UniProtKb:Q14524), NaV1.7 (UniProtKb:Q15858), and NaV1.9 (UniProtKb:Q9UI33)\u00a0in complex with CaM\u00a0(UniProtKb:P0DP23) (CTNaV1.X\u2013CaM) were used. The constructs of the CT regions of the voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms were named consistently as \u201ctruncated (T)\u201d for constructs ending at equivalent residue of NaV1.41764 and \u201cFL\u201d for constructs ending at equivalent residue of NaV1.41836. The constructs are CTNaV1.4T with amino acids 1599 to 1764, CTNaV1.4FL with amino acids 1599 to 1836, CTNaV1.5T with amino acids 1775 to 1940, CTNaV1.5FL with amino acids 1775 to 2016, CTNaV1.7T with amino acids 1761 to 1928, CTNaV1.7FL with amino acids 1761 to 1988, CTNaV1.9T with mino acids 1605 to 1768, and CTNaV1.9FL with amino acids 1605 to 1791 (Table\u00a0S1 and Fig.\u00a03B). Each construct was coexpressed with mammalian CaM and purified from BL21-CodonPlus RIL cells using a GST-sepharose column followed by anion exchange chromatography and a final gel filtration chromatography step as described by Yoder et\u00a0al. (29) with minor modifications. In brief, cells were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 100\u00a0ml of LB medium supplemented with 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml kanamycin, 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml carbenicillin. About 10 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 1\u00a0l of LB media containing the same antibiotics. The cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C to an absorbance of 0.8 to 0.9 at 600 nm, and protein expression was induced with 1\u00a0mM IPTG. The cells were grown overnight at 18 \u00b0C (approximately 18\u00a0h), centrifuged, and the cell pellet was frozen at\u00a0\u221280 \u00b0C. After thawing, pellets were resuspended with PBS at 5\u00d7 volume/weight ml/g of cells. DNAse was added, the cells were lysed using a microfluidizer, and the lysate was clarified at 27,500g. The supernatant was loaded on to a 3 ml GST resin using gravity flow. The column was washed with 30\u00a0ml wash buffer (PBS added with 100\u00a0mM NaCl), and free CaM was purified from this fraction for other experiments. The CTNaVT\u2013CaM and CTNaVFL\u2013CaM complexes were eluted in aliquots of 5\u00a0ml with an elution buffer containing 10\u00a0mM reduced l-glutathione in 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0). Eluted fractions containing protein were pooled, and 5\u00a0\u03bcg of PreScission protease was added per milligram of CTNaV\u2013CaM for cleaving the GST tag. Dialysis was performed against 2\u00a0l of buffer containing 20\u00a0mM Tris, 50\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\u00a0mM DTT, and pH 7.4. The buffer was changed twice, and the final dialysis was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The dialyzed and PreScission protease-cleaved protein was loaded on a 15\u00a0ml Source Q anion exchange column (GE). Elution was performed using buffer 20\u00a0mM Tris, 1\u00a0mM DTT, pH 7.4 and a gradient of 50 to 500\u00a0mM NaCl. Free and cleaved GST eluted at \u223c8\u2009mS/cm, and CTNaV\u2013CaM complexes eluted at between 14 and 27\u2009mS/cm conductance that varied depending on the NaV isoform. Fractions were judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE gel and then pooled and concentrated to \u223c15 to 20\u00a0mg/ml and flash frozen and stored at\u00a0\u221280 \u00b0C. In the case of CTNaV1.9T and CTNaV1.9FL, CaM did not coelute with the CTNaVs unlike the other cases."

Data were analyzed after baselines were subtracted as described by Freire (40). The resulting transition excess heat capacity curves were fitted by nonlinear least squares in terms of reversible or irreversible denaturation models depending on whether the transitions were reversible or irreversible (33).
