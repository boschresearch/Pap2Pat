                        "Vaccines protect against a wide variety of infectious diseases. Many vaccines are produced by inactivated or attenuated pathogens which are injected into a subject, whereas others, so called \u2018subunit vaccines\u2019, are made from proteins or polysaccharides displayed on the surface of the pathogen. Subunit vaccines are preferred over inactivated or attenuated pathogens as they tend to cause fewer side effects. However, the development and production of a subunit vaccine requires the identification and isolation of protective antigens from the pathogenic organism, and moreover subunit vaccines based on polysaccharide antigens invoke often a T-cell independent immune response which results in low antibody titre, short half-life of the antibodies and low affinity for a specific antigen.",
                        "The development of subunit vaccines is an active research area and it has been recognized that the immunogenicity of polysaccharide antigens can be enhanced by conjugation to a protein carrier. Glycoconjugates have the ability to induce both humoral and adaptive immune responses. Currently licensed human glycoconjugate vaccines include those against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisserria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, by which bacterial polysaccharides are chemically bound to carrier proteins. The H. influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine or Prevnar\u00ae, a 13-valent capsule-based glycoconjugate vaccine protective against diseases caused by S. pneumonia, employs the carrier protein iCRM197, a non-toxic version of diphtheria toxin isolated from Corynebacterium diphtheria.",
                        "Although these vaccines are effective, their production requires both the purification of polysaccharide glycan from the native pathogen and the chemical coupling of the sugar to a suitable protein carrier, which can lead to impure products, low yields, variation between batches of conjugates and poses a biohazard as the handling of the pathogenic organism is unavoidable. This process is highly costly, inefficient and time consuming. The use of organic systems represents a more rapid and economical method for the production of glycoconjugates.",
                        "So far several pathogenic bacteria have been identified forming glycoproteins and the genes involved identified. The gram negative pathogenic bacterium Campylobacter jejuni harbours a gene cluster involved in the synthesis of lipo-oligosaccharides and N-linked glycoproteins.",
                        "The protein glycosylation locus, a cluster of 12 genes comprising pgIA-pgIG, is involved in the glycosylation of over 30 glycoproteins. Part of the gene cluster is PgIB, an oligosaccharyltransferase catalysing the transfer of glycans on to a wide range of different non-species related protein acceptors, indicating broad substrate specificity. Moreover PgIB when expressed in E. coli has been used to produce novel glycoconjugates providing a genetic tool to express heterologous recombinant glycoproteins. Production of glycoconjugate vaccines in a bacterial system are disclosed in patent application WO2009/104074. Glycoconjugates comprising a protein carrier and an antigenic polysaccharide O-antigen form Shigella, E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the oligosaccharyltransferase PgIB were produced, and bioconjugates against the Shigella O1 polysaccharide were shown to elicit an immune response.",
                        "Tularemia, also known as lemming or rabbit fever, is common in wild rodents and can be passed on to humans by contact with infected animal tissues, ticks or biting flies, or by inhalation of the infectious organism. Tularemia is found in North America, parts of Europe and Asia and is caused by the gram-negative coccobacillus Francisella tularensis. F. tularensis is highly infectious, with a mortality rate of up to 30% and based on the above listed characteristics classified as a Class A bioterrorism agent. Tularemia is difficult to diagnose, however, can be treated although with varying success with antibiotics. There are no vaccines available yet.",
                        "Recent studies suggest a protective effect using purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) comprising an O-antigen from F. tularensis in a murine infection model; however, the development of glycoprotein vaccines protecting against highly infectious pathogens to high quantities using current methods are associated with high safety concerns.",
                        "We disclose a novel bacterial protein glycan coupling technology (PGCT) that allows the production of protective vaccines from the highly virulent wild-type strain of F. tularensis holarctica. The recombinant glycoconjugate was easily purified and was capable of providing significant protection against subsequent challenge when compared to LPS based vaccine treatments."

Examples of adjuvants include, by example only, agonistic antibodies to co-stimulatory molecules, Freunds adjuvant, muramyl dipeptides, liposomes. An adjuvant is therefore an immunomodulator. A carrier is an immunogenic molecule which, when bound to a second molecule augments immune responses to the latter. The term carrier is construed in the following manner. A carrier is an immunogenic molecule which, when bound to a second molecule augments immune responses to the latter. Some antigens are not intrinsically immunogenic yet may be capable of generating antibody responses when associated with a foreign protein molecule such as keyhole-limpet haemocyanin or tetanus toxoid. Such antigens contain B-cell epitopes but no T cell epitopes. The protein moiety of such a conjugate (the \u201ccarrier\u201d protein) provides T-cell epitopes which stimulate helper T-cells that in turn stimulate antigen-specific B-cells to differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibody against the antigen. Helper T-cells can also stimulate other immune cells such as cytotoxic T-cells, and a carrier can fulfil an analogous role in generating cell-mediated immunity as well as antibodies.",

Growth media can also be obtained from commercial suppliers, for example Standard 1 (Merck) or BHI (brain heart infusion, DIFCO) and the like.",
                        "All media components are sterilized, either by heat (20 min at 1.5 bar and 121\u00b0 C.) or by filter sterilization. The components may be sterilized either together or, if required, separately. All media components may be present at the start of the cultivation or added continuously or batchwise, as desired.",
                        "The culture temperature is normally between 15\u00b0 C. and 45\u00b0 C., preferably at from 25\u00b0 C. to 40\u00b0 C., and may be kept constant or may be altered during the experiment. The pH of the medium should be in the range from 5 to 8.5, preferably around 7.0. The pH for cultivation can be controlled during cultivation by adding basic compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia and aqueous ammonia or acidic compounds such as phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid. Foaming can be controlled by employing antifoams such as, for example, fatty acid polyglycol esters. To maintain the stability of plasmids it is possible to add to the medium suitable substances having a selective effect, for example antibiotics. Aerobic conditions are maintained by introducing oxygen or oxygen-containing gas mixtures such as, for example, ambient air into the culture. The temperature of the culture is normally 20\u00b0 C. to 45\u00b0 C. and preferably 25\u00b0 C. to 40\u00b0 C. The culture is continued until formation of the desired product is at a maximum. This aim is normally achieved within 10 to 160 hours.",
                        "The fermentation broth can then be processed further. The biomass may, according to requirement, be removed completely or partially from the fermentation broth by separation methods such as, for example, centrifugation, filtration, decanting or a combination of these methods or be left completely in said broth. It is advantageous to process the biomass after its separation.",
                        "However, the fermentation broth can also be thickened or concentrated without separating the cells, using known methods such as, for example, with the aid of a rotary evaporator, thin-film evaporator, falling-film evaporator, by reverse osmosis or by nanofiltration. Finally, this concentrated fermentation broth can be processed to obtain the fatty acids present therein.",

The selected carrier protein was an inactivated form of the P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A variant L552V, \u0394E553 (ExoA) was selected [20]. The plasmid pGAB2 containing the F. tularensis O-antigen expressed in the low copy vector pLAFR1 [21] was transformed into E. coli CLM24 cells along with the plasmids pGVXN114 and pGVXN150 which contain CjPgIB and ExoA respectively. As negative glycosylation controls, CLM24 cells were transformed with either pGVXN150 alone or with the combination of pGAB2, pGVXN150 and pGVXN115, the latter coding for an inactive version of CjPgIB [18]. Following overnight induction of CjpgIB and exoA expression with 1 mM IPTG and 0.2% L-arabinose (w/v) respectively, cells were lysed and HIS tagged ExoA purified using Nickel columns. Elution fractions from each sample were separated by SDS PAGE and tested by immunoblotting with mAbFB011 specific for F. tularensis LPS. A band matching the expected size of ExoA and an O-antigen ladder pattern could only be seen when a functional CjPgIB was present (FIG. 3, lanes 2 and 2b). In the absence of a functional CjPgIB there was no cross-reaction with mAbFB11 (FIG. 3, lanes 1 and 3). To demonstrate that the O-antigen was bound to the carrier protein, HIS tagged ExoA F. tularensis O-antigen conjugate was purified and digested with Proteinase K. The disappearance of the O-antigen ladder after Proteinase K treatment but not in the untreated control confirmed that the O-antigen was anchored to ExoA (data not shown)."

The Sigma Adjuvant System\u00ae was selected for use in this study because it is based on monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a low toxicity derivative of LPS that has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective immunostimulant [22]. In order to demonstrate the specificity of the glycoconjugate we used controls including mice with SAS adjuvant alone, unvaccinated mice and mice vaccinated with a \u2018sham\u2019 glycoconjugate control (C. jejuni heptasaccharide conjugated to ExoA). Only mice vaccinated with 0.5 \u03bcg test glycoconjugate+SAS (P<0.05) or 0.5 \u03bcg LPS (P<0.001) demonstrated increased survival compared to the appropriate controls as determined by log rank test (FIG. 22). These candidates were selected for further assessment at higher doses and an additional group consisting of LPS+SAS was also added as a further control. Protection was compared between mice immunised with either 10 \u03bcg glycoconjugate+SAS, 10 \u03bcg LPS or 10 \u03bcg LPS+SAS. All three vaccines were protective when compared to the unvaccinated mice (P<0.001), while the SAS adjuvant alone did not elicit any protection (P>0.05) (FIG. 4). This experiment also indicated that LPS+SAS did not elicit the same level of protection as the glycoconjugate+SAS combination (P<0.05) and thereafter LPS+SAS was deemed unnecessary for testing. The study was repeated in order to provide further bacterial organ load and immunological response data and no statistically significant difference was found between replicates."
