                        "In the twentieth century, enormous strides were made in combating infectious diseases, in their detection and drugs to treat them. The major problem in the medical world has thus shifted from treating acute diseases to treating chronic diseases. Over the last few decades, with the advent of genetic engineering, much research and funding has been invested in genomics and gene-based personalized medicine. A need has arisen to develop diagnostic tools for use in the characterization of personalized aspects of chronic diseases and diseases associated with aging.",
                        "Novel methods have been developed for screening for drugs that can minimize the difference between the various cellular or tissue states in a variety of tissues, while also taking into accounting for toxicity and adverse effect of the drug.",
                        "Intracellular signaling pathways regulate numerous processes involved in normal and pathological conditions including development, growth, aging and cancer. Many bioinformatics tools have been developed, which analyze signaling pathways.",
                        "The information relating to signaling pathway activation can be obtained from the massive proteomic or transcriptomic data. Although the proteomic level may be somewhat closer to the biological function of signaling pathway activation, the transcriptomic level of studies today is far more feasible in terms of performing experimental tests and analyzing the data.",
                        "US2008254497A provides a method of determining whether tumor cells or tissue is responsive to treatment with an ErbB pathway-specific drug. In accordance with the invention, measurements are made on such cells or tissues to determine values for total ErbB receptors of one or more types, ErbB receptor dimers of one or more types and their phosphorylation states, and/or one or more ErbB signaling pathway effector proteins and their phosphorylation states. These quantities, or a response index based on them, are positively or negatively correlated with cell or tissue responsiveness to treatment with an ErbB pathway-specific drug. In one aspect, such correlations are determined from a model of the mechanism of action of an ErbB pathway-specific drug on an ErbB pathway. Preferably, methods of the invention are implemented by using sets of binding compounds having releasable molecular tags that are specific for multiple components of one or more complexes formed in ErbB pathway activation. After binding, molecular tags are released and separated from the assay mixture for analysis.",
                        "U.S. Pat. No. 8,623,592 discloses methods for treating patients which methods comprise methods for predicting responses of cells, such as tumor cells, to treatment with therapeutic agents. These methods involve measuring, in a sample of the cells, levels of one or more components of a cellular network and then computing a Network Activation State (NAS) or a Network Inhibition State (NIS) for the cells using a computational model of the cellular network. The response of the cells to treatment is then predicted based on the NAS or NIS value that has been computed. The invention also comprises predictive methods for cellular responsiveness in which computation of a NAS or NIS value for the cells (e.g., tumor cells) is combined with use of a statistical classification algorithm. Biomarkers for predicting responsiveness to treatment with a therapeutic agent that targets a component within the ErbB signaling pathway are also provided.",
                        "The application of novel supervised learning algorithms to large-scale transcriptomic data has the potential to transform conventional approaches for disease classification, personalized medicine and the development of prognostic models; however, their use as a modality for clinical applications is hindered by several recognized challenges and limitation. First, one of the most relevant challenges in transcriptomic data analysis is the inherent complexity of gene network interactions, which remains a significant obstacle in building comprehensive predictive models from transcriptomic data. Moreover, high diversity of experimental platforms, difficulties to understand the obtained values and inconsistency of the data coming from the various types of equipment\u2014may also lead to the incorrect interpretation of the underlying biological processes. Although a number of data normalization approaches have been proposed over the recent years (Walker, W. L. et al, 2008 and Shabalin et al, 2008)., it remains difficult to achieve robust results over a group of independent data sets even when they are obtained from the same profiling platform. This may be explained by a range of factors, such as wide heterogeneity among individuals on a population basis, variance in proliferation status and cell cycle stage in cells.",
                        "Despite these challenges, various transcriptomic data analysis algorithms have been developed by both academic and commercial settings, and numerous attempts have been made to apply these algorithms clinically, particularly, for predicting patient response to various anti-cancer therapies (Paik, 2004, Theurigen et al, (2006), Venkova (2015)).",
                        "Canonically, these approaches aimed to identify differentially expressed genes between groups of samples. Although this can lead to the identification of prospective genetic biomarkers and expression signature patterns of the process under study, it fails to capture subtle differences between samples that arise from dynamic interactions between genes at the systemic level. To circumvent this limitation a number of computational scoring platforms that can project gene expression data into a network of molecular signaling have been proposed for integrative pathway analysis (Braun et al, (2014)).",
                        "The major advantage of pathway-based methods is their capability to perform biologically relevant dimension reduction as a result of the analysis. However, despite significant advancements, current pathway-based methods are still imperfect in extrapolating the functional states of transcriptomes into the biological networks. Many popular pathway-based algorithms, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and its extensions, rely solely on gene enrichment statistics, treating pathways as unstructured sets of genes (Subramanian, A. et al. (2005)). Another group, including Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA), Topology GSA, and DEGraph, treats pathways as directed or undirected graphs representing networks of biochemical interactions at gene and protein levels (Tarca, A. L. et al. (2009), Jacob et al. (2010) Massa et al. (2010)).",
                        "The Oncofinder algorithm represents a halfway approach, where information about pathway topology is used to assign activation or repression roles of particular genes in the pathway and then estimate its overall activation (Buzdin, et al., Front Mol Biosci 1, (2014). Although very helpful, these approaches cannot overcome other above-mentioned limitations, posing a need for development of the new large-scale analytical methodologies that more accurately infer complex transcriptomic changes into the network of biologically relevant signaling axes.",
                        "There thus remains a need for systems and methods for robust transcriptomic data analysis. Prior art traditional methods for transcriptomic data analysis may not be sufficient in many cases. For example, breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the US, after skin cancer. Breast cancer is also the second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer (Siegel, et al., Cancer J. Clin. (2015)). Hence, there is strong demand for the development of a new generation of highly robust transcriptomic data analysis methods."

                                "An Overview of iPANDA Method",
                                "Fold changes between the gene expression levels in the samples under investigation (tumor samples) and an average expression level between a set of normal samples is used as input data for the iPANDA algorithm. Since some genes may have a stronger influence on pathway activation than others, the gene importance factor (GIF) has been introduced. Several approaches of gene importance hierarchy calculation have been proposed during the last few decades. All of these approaches aim to enrich pathway-based models with specific gene markers that are the most relevant for a given study. Some of them use detailed kinetic models of several particular metabolic networks to derive importance factors (Borisov et al. (2008)). In others, gene importance is derived from the statistical analysis of the gene expression data obtained for case and normal samples. Other approaches are based on the topological decomposition of the pathway maps and tend to give higher weight to the genes that occupy the central positions on the map (Gu et al. (2012)). Importantly, however, the measure of gene centrality strongly varies between algorithms. The novel approach integrates the different analytical concepts described above as it simultaneously exploits statistical and topological weights for gene importance estimation.",
                                "The smooth threshold, defined hereinbelow, based on the p-values from a t-test performed on groups of normal and tumor samples is applied to the gene expression values. The smooth threshold is defined as a continuous function of p-value ranging from 0 to 1. The statistical weights are also derived during this procedure. The topological weights for genes are obtained during the pathway map decomposition procedure. The topological weight of each gene is proportional to the number of independent paths through the pathway gene network represented as a directed graph.",
                                "It is well known that many genes often exhibit considerable correlation in expression levels (Okamura et al. (2015)). However, most algorithms for pathway analysis treat gene expression levels as independent variables. Such an approach is particularly inappropriate when topology-based coefficients are applied. In fact, if a set of coexpressed genes has correlated expression levels and hence fold change values in the data set, there is no significant dependence of pathway activation values on how the topology weights are distributed over these genes. Thus, the computation of topological coefficients for a set of coexpressed genes is inefficient, unless a group of coexpressed genes is being considered as a single unit. For this reason, gene modules reflecting the coexpression of genes were introduced in the iPANDA algorithm. The wide database of gene coexpression in human samples, COEXPRESdb (Okamura et al. (2015), and the database of the downstream genes controlled by various transcriptional factors (Zheng et al. (2008)) are utilized for grouping genes into modules. Thus the topological coefficients are estimated for each gene module as a whole rather than for individual genes inside the module.",
                                "The contribution of gene units (including gene modules and individual genes) to pathway activation is computed as a product of their fold changes in logarithmic scale, topological and statistical weights. Then the contributions are multiplied by a discrete coefficient which equals to +1 or \u22121 in the case of pathway activation or suppression by the particular unit respectively. Finally the activation scores, referred to as iPANDA values, are obtained as a linear combination of the scores calculated for gene units that contribute to the pathway activation/suppression. Therefore, the iPANDA values are signed scores showing the intensity and direction of pathway activation (see Methods section for details).",
                                "Pathway Quality Metrics",
                                "Unfortunately, there is no standardized pipeline for the benchmarking of transcriptomic data analysis algorithms. We aim to generalize the approaches for pathway-based algorithm testing and reveal the common features of reliable pathway-based expression data analysis. We term these features \u201cpathway analysis quality hallmarks\u201d. Efficient methods for pathway-based transcriptomic data analysis should be capable to perform a significant noise reduction in the input data and aggregate output data as a small number of highly informative features (pathway markers). Scalability (the ability to process pathways with small or large numbers of genes similarly), is another critical aspect that should be considered when designing a reliable pathway analysis approach, since pathway activation values for pathways of different sizes should be equally credible. The list of pathway markers identified should be relevant to the specific phenotype or medical condition, and robust over multiple data sets related to the process or biological state under investigation. The calculation time should be reasonable to allow high-throughput screening of large transcriptomic data sets. To address the iPANDA algorithm in respect to these hallmarks and to fully assess its true potential and limitations, we have directly compared the results obtained by iPANDA using the breast cancer and MAQC datasets with two other widely used third-party viable alternatives, GSEA (Subramanian, A. et al. (2005)), SPIA (Tarca et al (2009)).",

                                "The first important issue that should be addressed by any suitable transcriptomic data analysis algorithm is the ability to reduce noise while retaining the biologically relevant information of the results. Since pathway-based analysis algorithms are considered dimension reduction techniques, the pathway activation scores should represent collective variables describing only biologically significant changes in the gene expression profile.",
                                "In order to estimate the ability of the iPANDA algorithm to perform noise reduction while preserving biologically relevant features, an analysis was performed using the well-known MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) data set (GEO identifier GSE5350) (Shippy et al, (2006)). It contains data for the same cell samples processed using various transcriptome profiling platforms. A satisfactory pathway or network analysis algorithm should reduce the noise level and demonstrate a higher degree of similarity between the samples in comparison to the similarity calculated using gene set data. To estimate gene level similarity, only fold changes for differentially expressed genes (t-test p-value<0.05) were utilized. Pearson correlation was chosen as a metric to measure the similarity between samples. Sample-wise correlation coefficients were obtained for the same samples profiled on Affymetrix and Agilent platforms. Similar procedure was performed using pathway activation values (iPANDA values). The results acquired for the set of samples from MAQC data are shown in FIG. 2. Notably, the similarity calculated using pathway activation values generated by the iPANDA algorithm significantly exceeds the one calculated using fold changes for the differentially expressed genes (mean sample-wise correlation was over 0.88 and 0.79, respectively). For further validation the algorithm's noise reduction efficacy was compared with that of other routinely used methods for transcriptome-based pathways analysis, such as SPIA and GSEA. The mean sample-wise correlation between platforms was 0.88 for iPANDA compared to 0.53 for GSEA and 0.84 for SPIA. Furthermore, the sample-wise correlation distribution obtained using iPANDA values is narrowed to a range of 0.79 to 0.94, compared to 0.60-0.92 and \u22120.08-0.80 for SPIA and GSEA respectively. Taken together, iPANDA demonstrates better performance for the noise reduction test in comparison to other pathway analysis approaches suggesting that its credibility as a powerful tool for noise reduction in transcriptomic data analysis.",

                                "As a next step, the iPANDA ability to identify biomarkers (or pathway markers) of the process or phenotype under investigation was addressed. One of the commonly used methods to assess the capability of transcriptomic pathway markers to distinguish between two groups of samples (e.g. resistance and sensitivity to treatment) is to measure their ROC AUC values. The capacity to generate a high number of biomarkers with high AUC values is a major requirement for any prospective transcriptomic data analysis algorithm.",
                                "To estimate the capability of the methods to produce potential biomarkers, several gene expression data sets from breast cancer patients were chosen with measured response to Paclitaxel-based treatment. iPANDA algorithm was applied to obtain pathway activation scores for each sample and lists of the top 30 Paclitaxel treatment sensitivity pathway markers obtained for the ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N breast cancer types are given in FIG. 3. Signaling pathways were ranked by their average AUC values over four independent data sets. Pathways like ErbB, PTEN, BRCA1, PPAR, TGF-beta and RAS, which were previously reported to trigger Paclitaxel treatment response, can be found in these lists (Harari et al. (2000), Gilmore et al. (2004), Chen et al., (2012) and (Bhola et al., (2013)). Although the iPANDA-generated pathway marker lists obtained within data on the same cancer type have noticeable intersection, the lists of markers differ significantly between cancer types. This complies with the observation that the mechanisms of Paclitaxel treatment resistance are sensitive to cancer type (Baselga et al., (1997), Nelson (2000)).",
                                "Pathways with various numbers of member genes ranging from less than 10 members (VEGF pathway adhesion turnover) to over 400 (Ras main pathway) can be found on the lists. This illustrates that iPANDA algorithm treats smaller pathways in the same way as larger ones, hence demonstrates the scalability hallmark of valid pathway analysis methods.",
                                "iPANDA Produces Highly Robust Set of Biomarkers",
                                "One of the most important shortcomings of modern pathway analysis approaches is their inability to produce consistent results for different data sets obtained independently for the same biological case. iPANDA algorithm applied to the breast cancer data is shown to overcome this flaw and produce highly-consistent set of pathway markers across the data sets examined. In particular, the iPANDA values for 26 and 14 pathways for ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N breast cancer types, respectively, can be utilized as Paclitaxel response classifiers with AUC values higher than 0.8 for all four data sets. On the contrary, all of the third-party algorithms tested (including GSEA, SPIA) are not able to obtain even a single pathway marker with the same AUC threshold equal to 0.8 common to all four data sets examined for both cancer types. These findings suggest that the iPANDA is an extremely favorable choice for biologically relevant pathway marker development compared to the other pathway-based algorithms.",
                                "The Common Marker Pathway (CMP) index (see Methods section for details) was applied to Paclitaxel treatment response data for both ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N breast cancer types in order to estimate the robustness of the biomarker lists. Pathway marker lists obtained for four independent data sets were analyzed. The calculation of pathway activation scores was performed using the original iPANDA algorithm and its variants with disabled gene grouping and/or topological weights. The results of the calculation are shown in FIG. 4. The \u201coff\u201d state of topology coefficients means that they are equal to 1 for all genes during the calculation. Also the \u201coff\u201d state for the gene grouping means that all the genes are treated as individual genes. The application of the gene modules without topology-based coefficients reduces the robustness of the algorithm as well as the overall number of common pathway markers between data sets. Turning on the topology-based coefficients just slightly increases the robustness of the algorithm, whereas using topology with gene modules simultaneously improves this parameter drastically for both cancer types. This result implies that the combined implementation of the gene modules along with the topology-based coefficients serves as an effective way of noise reduction in gene expression data and allows one to obtain stable pathway activation scores for a set of independent data.",
                                "The Application of iPANDA Biomarkers as Classifiers for Treatment Response Prediction",
                                "The pathway activation scores obtained using iPANDA were applied to the identification of Paclitaxel chemotherapy sensitivity in breast cancer. The normalized iPANDA values were calculated for all samples in four data sets and merged for the clustering procedure. The major part of the activation scores splits well for the responders and non-responders groups respectively. Hence the iPANDA values can be considered promising classifiers for Paclitaxel treatment response prediction. On the other hand, the scores obtained using other pathway-based algorithms overlap significantly between groups for the majority of the pathway markers.",
                                "The pairwise distance matrices between samples were calculated using the 30 top pathway markers, ranked by their average AUC values for ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N breast cancer data (see Methods section). In order to classify the samples as responders or non-responders, hierarchical clustering using Ward linkage was performed on the distance matrices (FIG. 5). Distinct clusters containing mostly the samples from responders or non-responders groups, respectively, were obtained for both cancer types. The ratios of false positive (type I error) and false negative (type II error) predictions of Paclitaxel treatment response are given in Table 1. The similar clustering procedure using biomarkers and pathway activation (enrichment) scores obtained using other algorithms failed to distinguish between the responders and non-responders groups.",
                                "As it can be seen in FIGS. 5(A,B), the clustering performed using normalized iPANDA values distinguishes Paclitaxel treatment responders from non-responders. On the other hand, clustering becomes insensitive to the distinctions between data sets and the samples from different data sets are mixed upon the hierarchical tree for both cancer types under investigation. The use of 10 top-ranked pathway markers for Paclitaxel response prediction in ERN HER2P patients gives 100% accuracy. ERN HER2N breast cancer and especially its triple negative subclass (also progesterone receptor negative) is known to have the most diverse phenotype (Podo et al. (2010)). Therefore searching for an effective therapy and prediction of the therapy outcome for this type of breast cancer is a challenging task. Nevertheless, the application of iPANDA values as classifiers for Paclitaxel treatment response prediction in ERN HER2N breast cancer showed approximately 90% accuracy. Thus such a result appears to be a significant success.",
                                "Besides, taxol-based neoadjuvant therapy response prediction was performed using another pretreatment data set (GSE22513) with unspecified receptor status, but known treatment outcome. A set of 30 pathway markers which consisted of 15 top pathway markers previously obtained for ERN HER2P cancer type and 15 top pathway markers obtained for ERN HER2N cancer type. All 28 samples (8 responders and 20 non-responders) from the data set were correctly separated into two groups. The results show that patient classification according to their potential treatment response can be successful even in case when receptor status is unknown. These finding suggest that despite the differences between breast cancer types, both ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N cancer hold common features which can define treatment response sensitivity. However, stratification of data from four previously discussed breast cancer data sets was impossible without accounting receptor status (data not shown).",
                                "In order to estimate the cross-study validity of iPANDA pathway marker application to treatment response prediction in breast cancer, prediction using separate training and test data sets was performed. Training set consisted of three independent pretreatment data sets (GSE20271, GSE32646 and GSE50948) with known treatment outcome and receptor status. Training set was used for obtaining list of 30 pathway markers with highest AUC values. MAQC-II breast cancer data set (GSE20194) was used as a test set. ERN HER2N and ERN HER2P samples were extracted using information about MAQC-II endpoint D (HER2 and ER receptor status). The samples were classified then, separately for each cancer type based on their iPANDA scores for pathway markers obtained from the training set. Results were compared to the actual data about treatment outcome (endpoint E in MAQC-II data). Results of MAQC-II data classification are shown in FIG. 5(C,F). False negative and false positive rates of predictions are given in Table 1. FIG. 5(D,F) shows corresponding similarity plots obtained using gene-level data (differentially expressed genes with group t-test p-value <0.05) for ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N cancer types in MAQC-II data set. It can be seen that in contrast to stratification based on iPANDA pathway markers, gene-level based classification fails to produce clusters corresponding to Paclitaxel treatment sensitivity. This data confirms that highly robust sets of pathway markers produced by iPANDA provide potential for wider applications of transcriptomic data analysis especially in case when cross-study comparison is inevitable.",

                                "Application of the pathway activation measurement implemented in iPANDA leads to significant noise reduction in the input data and hence enhances the ability to produce highly consistent sets of biologically relevant biomarkers acquired on multiple transcriptomic data sets. Another advantage of the approach presented is the high speed of the computation. The gene grouping and topological weights are the most demanding parts of the algorithm from the perspective of computational resources. Luckily these parts can be precalculated only once prior to the actual calculations using transcriptomic data. The calculation time for a single sample processing equals approximately 1.4 seconds on the Intel (R) Core i3-3217U 1.8 GHz CPU (compared to 1.2 seconds for PAS, 10 seconds for GSEA and 10 minutes 08 seconds for SPIA). Thus iPANDA can be an efficient tool for high-throughput biomarker screening of large transcriptomic data sets.",
                                "The use of merely microarray data for pathway activation analysis has well-known limitations, as it cannot address individual variations in the gene sequence and consequently in the activity of its product. For example, a gene can have a mutation that reduces activity of its product but elevates its expression level, through a negative feedback loop. Thus the elevated expression of the gene does not necessarily correspond to the increase in the activity of its product. Although the iPANDA algorithm was initially designed for microarray data analysis it can also be easily applied to the data derived from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). In order to do so, GWAS data can be converted to a form amenable for the iPANDA algorithm. Single point mutations (SNPs) are assigned to the genes based on their proximity to the reading frames. Then each SNP is given a weight derived from a GWAS data statistical analysis (Torkamani et al. (2008). Simultaneous use of the GWAS data along with microarray data may improve the predictions made using the iPANDA method.",
                                "Recently, several successful studies on microarray data analysis using various deep learning approaches on gene-level data have surfaced (Hira et al. (2015). From an experimental point of view, gene regulatory networks are controlled via activation or inhibition of a specific set of signaling pathways (set is dependent on the type of protocol and outcome expected). Thus, using the iPANDA signaling pathway activation scores as input for deep learning methods could bring results closer to experimental reality and make them more interpretable to bench biologists. One of the most difficult steps of multilayer perceptron training is the dimension reduction and feature selection procedures which aim to generate the appropriate input for further learning (Ibrahim et al. (2014). Signaling pathway activation scoring using iPANDA will likely help reduce the dimensionality of expression data without losing biological relevance and may be used as an input to deep learning methods. Using iPANDA values as an input data seems to be a particularly promising approach to obtaining reproducible results when analyzing transcriptomic data from multiple sources.",

Activation sign Aip is a discrete coefficient showing the direction in which the particular gene affects the pathway given. It equals +1 if the product of the gene i has a positive contribution to the pathway activation and \u22121 if it has a negative contribution. The factors wiS and wipT are the statistical and topological weights of the gene i ranging from 0 to 1. The derivation procedure for these factors is described in detail in the subsequent sections. Since lg(fci) and Aip values can be positive or negative, the iPANDA values for the pathways can also have different signs. Thus positive or negative iPANDA values correspond to pathway activation or inhibition respectively. The principal scheme of the iPANDA algorithm is shown in FIG. 1.",
