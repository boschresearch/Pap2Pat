                        "A quantum computer has a computing capability far higher than a classical computer in resolving some problems. Therefore, the quantum computer can provide quick solutions to some computing problems for which exponential time is required in an ordinary computer. However, quantum properties of qubits are easily lost due to the influence of noise, and coherent superposition of a quantum state gradually disappears over time, leading to an information error. Therefore, ensuring that information is not destroyed in a quantum computer is a necessary condition to build a mature quantum computer.",
                        "A main challenge in building a quantum computer is that a bit flip or phase flip error is caused to due to physical qubits because qubits are quite fragile and susceptible to noise. Therefore, error information needs to be detected and corrected before being received. A challenge in correcting the error information is that an error cannot be detected. However, in a topology of a physical qubit array, a topological code that stores logical qubits can be used for error detection. A conventional quantum circuit may be limited due to inaccuracy of a basic gate and quantum decoherence. A topological quantum error correction code is currently one of the most promising implementations in quantum memories and computers. The topological code is encoded into a two-dimensional structure of qubits. This can ensure that an error is not propagated into a multi-qubit error that cannot be corrected by a quantum error correction code, consumes few resources, and is efficient. Moreover, the topological code can eliminate the influence of decoherence and inaccurate transmission during quantum information transmission. However, currently, there is no technology for correcting error information in transmission by using a topological quantum error correction code. In view of this, a method for transmitting information through topological quantum error correction based on multi-space-time transformation is proposed."
