For example, the wireless network could include any number of gNBs and any number of UEs in any suitable arrangement. Also, the gNB 101 could communicate directly with any number of UEs and provide those UEs with wireless broadband access to the network 130. Similarly, each gNB 102-103 could communicate directly with the network 130 and provide UEs with direct wireless broadband access to the network 130.

The RF transceivers 210a-210n down-convert the incoming RF signals to generate IF or baseband signals. The IF or baseband signals are sent to the RX processing circuitry 220, which generates processed baseband signals by filtering, decoding, and/or digitizing the baseband or IF signals. The RX processing circuitry 220 transmits the processed baseband signals to the controller/processor 225 for further processing.",

The TX processing circuitry 215 encodes, multiplexes, and/or digitizes the outgoing baseband data to generate processed baseband or IF signals. The RF transceivers 210a-210n receive the outgoing processed baseband or IF signals from the TX processing circuitry 215 and up-converts the baseband or IF signals to RF signals that are transmitted via the antennas 205a-205n.",
                        "The controller/processor 225 can include one or more processors or other processing devices that control the overall operation of the gNB 102. For example, the controller/processor 225 could control the reception of forward channel signals and the transmission of reverse channel signals by the RF transceivers 210a-210n, the RX processing circuitry 220, and the TX processing circuitry 215 in accordance with well-known principles. The controller/processor 225 could support additional functions as well, such as more advanced wireless communication functions. That is, the controller/processor 225 can perform a blind interference sensing (BIS) process, such as performed by a BIS algorithm, and decode the received signal subtracted by the interfering signals. Any of a wide variety of other functions can be supported in the gNB 102 by the controller/processor 225. In some embodiments, the controller/processor 225 includes at least one microprocessor or microcontroller",
                        "In certain embodiments, the controller/processor 225 could support beam forming or directional routing operations in which outgoing signals from multiple antennas 205a-205n are weighted differently to effectively steer the outgoing signals in a desired direction. Any of a wide variety of other functions could be supported in the gNB 102 by the controller/processor 225.",
                        "The controller/processor 225 is also capable of executing programs and other processes resident in the memory 230, such as an OS. The controller/processor 225 can move data into or out of the memory 230 as required by an executing process.",

The controller/processor 225 can move data into or out of the memory 230 as required by an executing process.",
                        "The controller/processor 225 is also coupled to the backhaul or network interface 235. The backhaul or network interface 235 allows the gNB 102 to communicate with other devices or systems over a backhaul connection or over a network. The interface 235 could support communications over any suitable wired or wireless connection(s). For example, when the gNB 102 is implemented as part of a cellular communication system (such as one supporting 5G, LTE, or LTE-A), the interface 235 could allow the gNB 102 to communicate with other gNBs over a wired or wireless backhaul connection. When the gNB 102 is implemented as an access point, the interface 235 could allow the gNB 102 to communicate over a wired or wireless local area network or over a wired or wireless connection to a larger network (such as the Internet). The interface 235 includes any suitable structure supporting communications over a wired or wireless connection, such as an Ethernet or RF transceiver.",

Part of the memory 230 could include a RAM, and another part of the memory 230 could include a Flash memory or other ROM. In certain embodiments, a plurality of instructions, such as a BIS algorithm is stored in memory 230. The plurality of instructions are configured to cause the controller/processor 225 to perform the BIS process and to decode a received signal after subtracting out at least one interfering signal determined by the BIS algorithm.",

                        "Although FIG. 2 illustrates one example of gNB 102, various changes may be made to FIG. 2. For example, the gNB 102 could include any number of each component shown in FIG. 2. As a particular example, an access point could include a number of interfaces 235, and the controller/processor 225 could support routing functions to route data between different network addresses. As another particular example, while shown as including a single instance of TX processing circuitry 215 and a single instance of RX processing circuitry 220, the gNB 102 could include multiple instances of each (such as one per RF transceiver). Also, various components in FIG. 2 could be combined, further subdivided, or omitted and additional components could be added according to particular needs.",

At lower carrier frequencies, the more benign propagation losses may make it feasible for gNB 102 to provide coverage with a single transmit beam; that is, to ensure adequate received signal quality at all UE locations within the coverage area via the usage of a single transmit beam. In other words, at lower transmit signal carrier frequencies, the transmit power amplification provided by the transmit beam with a width large enough to cover the area may be sufficient to overcome the propagation losses to ensure adequate received signal quality at all UE locations within the coverage area. However, at higher signal carrier frequencies, the transmit beam power amplification corresponding to the same coverage area may not be sufficient to overcome the higher propagation losses, resulting in a degradation of received signal quality at UE locations within the coverage area. In order to overcome such a received signal quality degradation, the gNB 102 may form a number of transmit beams, each providing coverage over a region narrower than the overall coverage region; but providing the transmit power amplification sufficient to overcome the higher signal propagation loss due to the usage of higher transmit signal carrier frequencies.

A beam codebook comprises a set of codewords, where a codeword is a set of analog phase shift values, or a set of amplitude plus phase shift values, applied to the antenna elements, in order to form an analog beam. A mmWave beam codebook design is very important and challenging for the 5G mmWave base stations. Different from the low frequency bands, the mmWave antenna is inherently directional and mmWave signal can be very sensitive to blockage, reflection, and the like.",

Otherwise, UE 116 maintains the X-chain operation in operation 1820. In process 1800, Y is less than X. After each of operations 1815 and 1820, UE 116 again checks the temperature in operation 1805 and determines whether a temperature control has been triggered in operation 1810. If no trigger occurs, the UE maintains the currently sent chain beam; but if a trigger occurs, UE 116 reduces the a lower sub-beam chain. For example, when the temperature is below T1, UE 116 sets NUL=NDL=4; when the temperature is between T1 and T2, UE 116 sets NUL=NDL=3; when the temperature is between T2 and T3, UE 116 sets NUL=NDL=2; when the temperature is between T3 and T4, UE sets NUL=NDL=1; and if the temperature is above T4, UE 116 turns off the whole antenna module. UE 116 could try other antenna modules that are not as overheated as the current one, or choose to fallback to sub-6 GHz LTE or sub-6 GHz 5G connection or other connectivity technology that can help mitigate overheating.",
                        "In certain embodiments, UE 116 may not use the same number of chains for DL and UL as the temperature changes. In first option, UE 116 first reduces NUL to the minimum, and then reduces NDL since transmission usually consumes more power than reception. For example, if there are five chains, UE 116 can set [NDL, NUS]=[5 5]\u2192[5 4]\u2192[5 3]\u2192[5 2]\u2192[5 1]\u2192[4 1]\u2192[3 1]\u2192[2 1]\u2192[1 1] as the temperature increase. In the second option, UE 116 iteratively reduces NUL and NDL. For example, [NDL, NUS]=[5 5]\u2192[5 4]\u2192[4 4]\u2192[4 3]\u2192[3 3]\u2192[3 2]\u2192[2 2]\u2192[2 1]\u2192[1 1]. In this case, NDL is either equal to NUL or larger than NUL by one, such that the beam correspondence is maintained with high chance. In the third option, UE 116 reduces the number of chains according to the power consumption. UE 116 first sorts the pair [NDL NUS] in a decreasing order of power consumption and then deactivates the downlink/uplink chains by following the order. Note that if there is a minimum number of chains required to maintain the connection with BS, the above ordered list can be changed accordingly. For example, in the first option, the revised list could be [NDL, NUL]=[5 5]\u2192[5 4]\u2192[5 3]\u2192[4 3]\u2192[3 3], if 3-chain beam is needed to maintain the connection to gNB 102.",

                        "In certain embodiments, UE 116 determines the number of chains based on the signal strength/quality. If the signal strength/quality is above a threshold or sufficient to support the required data rate, UE 116 can activate less number of chains. The signal strength/quality can be decided from RSRP/RSRQ/SNR/SINR, and so forth. If the signal strength/quality drops below the threshold or insufficient to support the required data rate, UE 116 activates more and more chains until the signal strength/quality is above the threshold or the data rate requirement is met.",

In certain embodiments, if the full-chain beam transmission exceeds the maximum permissible limit, UE 116 can adopt a sub-chain beam for the transmission. The number of chains can be determined based on the radiation power of the antenna module, the distance to an eye or skin of the human operator of UE 116, and the MPE requirements determined by regulators, for example, FCC. The higher the transmission power and the closer the human eye or skin to the antenna module, the less the number of chains that should be used for the transmission.",

In operation 1905, UE 116 first checks one or more of, a temperature of UE 116, a signal strength, a battery level, or an MPE. For example, UE 116 checks where one or more of: the temperature is high; the signal strength is high, such as compared to the requirement for data rate; the battery level is low; or if the radiation does not meet MPE requirement. If none of the condition is met, in operation 1910, UE 116 can apply full-chain DL and UL operation, i.e., NDL=NUL=Nch. Alternatively, if any one of the conditions is met, UE 116 further checks if the PMI feedback is configured in operation 1915. If the UE 116 does not receive the PMI feedback configuration, which means channel reciprocity is required for gNB 102 precoding, in operation 1920, UE 116 applies same number of sub chains for DL and UL, i.e., NDL=NUL<Nch. Alternatively, if the PMI feedback is configured, UE 116 can apply different number of chains for DL and UL in operation 1925.

In certain embodiments, if the number of chains changes slightly, UE 116 performs a partial search or does not sweep the beams at all. For example, if the chain size of the previous beam (NDL, NUS) and new beam (N\u2032DL, N\u2032UL) is close, i.e., |NDL\u2212N\u2032DL|<\u03b4 (or |NUL\u2212N\u2032UL|<\u03b4), UE 116 can assume that the inter-chain beam mapping is fairly well and thus ignores a full sweeping operation.

                        "In certain embodiments, the beam management parameter could be adjusted as the UE 116 applies sub-chain operation. UE 116 usually sets RSRP threshold to trigger certain action in the beam management. For example, if the RSRP of the current antenna module drops below a threshold, sweep the other antenna modules to find a better module. The RSRP threshold should be adjusted if UE 116 applies sub-chain instead of full-chain operation. For instance, denoting the RSRP threshold for trigger module sweeping in the full-chain/sub-chain operation as RSRPth(Nch) and RSRPth(NDL), UE 116 sets RSRPth(1)<RSRPth(2)< . . . <RSRPth(Nch). The threshold gap can be determined from the CDF curve of the spherical coverage. For example, if CDF curve of the full-chain codebook is 10 dB better than that of the 1-chain codebook at the 50%-tile (or at the 100%-tile or 20%-tile or on average), UE could set RSRPth(1)=RSRPth(Nch)\u221210 dB.",

There could be multiple temperature sensors mounted on UE 116 and each sensor is disposed close to one antenna module. Therefore, if the temperatures of the modules are different, the different number of chains may be used. In addition, the signal strength of the modules can be different due to the antenna type (for example, patch or dipole), orientation, hand blockage, wireless channel, and. Thus, the number of chains to achieve the same SNR/throughput may be different across the modules, and UE 116 may apply separate sub-chain operations.",

This mapping of measurement table, although maybe not perfect, could still be performed and better than a cold start measurement of the new sub-chain beams.
