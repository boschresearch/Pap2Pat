    "title": "Sub-Chain Beam for mmWave Devices: A Trade-off between Power Saving and Beam Correspondence",
    "date": "2021-10-31",
    "abstract": "Beam correspondence, or downlink-uplink (DL-UL) beam reciprocity, refers to the assumption that the best beams in the DL are also the best beams in the UL. This is an important assumption that allows the existing beam management framework in 5G to rely heavily on DL beam sweeping and avoid UL beam sweeping: UL beams are inferred from the measurements of the DL reference signals. Beam correspondence holds when the radio configurations are symmetric in the DL and UL. However, as mmWave technology matures, the DL and the UL face different constraints often breaking the beam correspondence. For example, power constraints may require a UE to activate only a portion of its antenna array for UL transmission, while still activating the full array for DL reception. Meanwhile, if the UL beam with sub-array, named as sub-chain beam in this paper, has a similar radiation pattern as the DL beam, the beam correspondence can still hold. This paper proposes methods for sub-chain beam codebook design to achieve a trade-off between the power saving and beam correspondence.",

                "In the millimeter wave band, antenna arrays are usually adopted by UE to generate high-gain beams than the single antenna, and thus resulting in higher SNR and throughput. For example, [1]- [4] presented possible antenna array setups for mmWave 5G phones, where 2 \u00d7 1, 4 \u00d7 1 or 2 \u00d7 2 arrays are adopted. One of the key challenges for 5G and beyond is the UE power consumption [5]. The battery life and temperature control issue aggravates in the mmWave bands compared to the sub-6 GHz band. When the phone is heating up quickly, one straightforward solution is to fall back to the sub-6 GHz and turn off the mmWave array. The LTE fallback is not desired in general. First, the maximum data rate decreases from Gbps to a few hundred Mbps or less. Second, the frequent turn off/on of the mmWave antenna module incurs additional latency, power consumption, and even service disruption.",
                "Instead of falling back to LTE, an alternative solution is to reduce the number of activated antenna elements. Such kind of beam which only activates a part of the array is called 'subchain beam' in this paper, since the antennas on the same array are connected to the same RF chain. Meanwhile, the beam which activates the whole array is called 'full-chain beam'. Note that the deactivation approach has been used to create wide beams [6], [7] in hierarchical codebook design, but in this paper, it is utilized to save the power and prevent overheating, instead of broadening the beamwidth.",
                "An example of the sub-chain beam operation is shown in Fig. 1, where UE activates only a portion of its antenna array for UL transmission, while still activating the full array for DL reception. This operation scheme is chosen since 1) the transmission consumes much more power than the reception, and 2) the downlink data rate requirement is usually higher than the uplink.",
                "The 5G standard has defined the process of identifying and maintaining a suitable beam pair for the BS-UE link, which is known as beam management (BM) [8]- [11]. The above operation scheme could destroy the DL-UL beam correspondence in 5G BM, which refers to the assumption that the best beams in the downlink direction are also the best beams in the uplink direction. DL-UL beam correspondence is an important design criterion, since an additional separate UL "

Although the total radiated power can be same between sub-chain and this option, the total power consumption is different. Activating a power amplifier (PA) requires a base power regardless of the power level. The option of reducing the power level still needs to turn on all the PAs, which means more base power consumption. In contrast, if we turn off some PAs (sub-chain beam), we can save not only the transmitted power but also the base power.",

For a given activation without L0 norm constraints, P1 can be solved efficiently by an iterative algorithm which optimizes the phase cyclically [1, Algorithm 3]. Although the iterative algorithm provides a local optimum, we can run it multiple times with different initial beams, and select the best local optimum as the final solution.

The same observation holds for the BC-SC-Max codebooks shown in Fig. 4.

It is much better than the previous results shown in Fig. 5(b), but is still clearly worse than the Sim-Max and BC-SC-Max method in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(c). It implies that repairing is not a sufficient solution to maintain the beam correspondence. Last but not least, we compare the spherical coverage of those codebooks by checking the composite beam gain CDF on the unit-sphere. Fig. 7 shows the CDF curves for the fullchain, and sub-chain codebooks of the three methods. Note that the repairing does not change the spherical coverage of the SC-Max codebooks. First, as expected, the spherical coverage improves with the number of antennas and the 5-Ant case is the best one. Second, the spherical coverage of the Sim-Max codebooks are worse than the other two methods, especially in the low percentile region. Third, we find that the BC-SC-Max method achieves the similar spherical coverage as the SC-Max method! V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a practical beam operation scheme for mmWave 5G devices to increase the utilization of mmWave band. Because of the high power consumption and heating of mmWave antennas, mmWave devices frequently fall back to sub-6 GHz band, and sporadically utilize the mmWave band. We proposed a sub-chain beam operation which deactivates part of the mmWave antenna array in the uplink transmission when the device is overheating. The antenna deactivation, however, could destroy the downlinkuplink beam correspondence. The more the antenna deactivation, the worse the beam correspondence. We proposed three methods to carefully design the sub-chain codebooks. The Sim-Max method generates sub-chain beams resembling the shape of full-chain beams, the SC-Max method optimizes the spherical coverage of the sub-chain codebooks, and the BC-SC-Max method takes into account both the similarity and spherical coverage.",
                        "We performed extensive simulations of a real 5G phone to compare the performance of the three methods. We found that the BC-SC-Max method is the best one. It can achieve superior spherical coverage close to the SC-Max method which is dedicated to spherical coverage maximization. Meanwhile, it maximally maintains the beam correspondence. The beam correspondence holds for 90% of the time when switching among full-chain, 4-Ant and 3-Ant sub-chain beam codebooks. When UE chooses to use 1-Ant beam to save the power as much as possible, the BC-SC-Max method still preserves the beam correspondence for more than 60% of the time."
