                        "Mid-infrared band (3-20 \u03bcm) laser pulse has important application in basic scientific research, biomedical application, precision manufacturing, etc. As the spectrum at the wave band covers many characteristic oscillation modes of organic molecules and thus generates characteristic oscillation absorption spectra, it has unique capability in diagnostic identification and manipulation research. In particular, the generation of ultra-short and ultra-intense mid-infrared laser pulses has brought important research tools for scientific research, for example, in realizing ultra-high subharmonic radiation, high energy attosecond (1 attosecond=10\u221218 seconds) pulses, multi-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, ultra-fast dynamic imaging, and particle acceleration.",
                        "At present, the method for generating ultra-short and ultra-intense mid-infrared light pulses is mainly based on the traditional nonlinear crystalline materials technology. However, due to the limitations of the frequency bandwidth, damage threshold, and energy gain of the crystalline material, it is difficult to generate fewer-cycle mid-infrared light pulses with multi-millijoule (1 millijoule=10\u22123 Joules) and high intensity. As the number of the optical cycle decreases and wavelength increases, the generation of fewer-cycle infrared light pulses with high intensity and high energy becomes more challenging, which has become one of the difficulties in current photophysics. Currently, near-single-cycle mid-infrared pulse energy obtained based on crystalline materials optics is typically limited to tens of micro-joules (1 micro-joule=10\u22126 joules) with peak intensity (Io) within the order of terawatts per square centimeter (1012 W/cm2), which greatly limits their research capabilities and application range. When the driving light field has longer wavelength (\u03bb), higher light intensity, shorter oscillation period, and higher pulse energy, its research and application capability is greatly enhanced, for example, a brighter and shorter femtosecond pulse light source can be generated by utilizing the interaction of the light pulse and gas atoms, and the resulting photon energy (proportional to the product I0\u03bb2 of the intensity and the square of the wavelength) is extended to a hard X-ray energy range. In addition, when the peak intensity of the driving light field reaches a relativistic intensity (I0\u02dc(1/\u03bb2[\u03bcm])\u00d71018 W/cm2), it may open up the relativistic nonlinear optics in the mid-infrared optical band and bring unprecedented exploration ability and opportunity for scientific research. Previously, the chirped pulse amplification technique invented by Donna Strickland and Gerard Mourou in 1985 significantly enhanced the laser intensity in the near-infrared band (laser wavelength around 1 micrometer) (over 1018 watts per square centimeter), making the first time achieving a relativistic intense region of laser intensity. The technology has revolutionized laser physics and technology science, opened the field of nonlinear optics, and brought important research value for many scientific research. To date, relativistic nonlinear optics has been mainly limited to the near infrared band.",
                        "In recent years, research on the generation of new radiation sources based on laser plasma optics has received extensive attention and development. In contrast to conventional optical crystalline materials, plasma as a carrier medium can withstand laser pulses of extremely high power, intensity, and energy, thereby being suitable for controlling and generating high intensity light pulses and high energy radiation sources. At present, based on laser plasma optical methods, researchers have researched and developed mechanisms that can generate light sources of various wave bands, for example, ultra-short and ultra-intense mid-infrared pulses can be generated by self-modulation and self-compression effects of ultra-high power relativistic intense laser pulses in plasma. However, the mid-infrared pulses generated by pulse self-modulation and self-compression are a continuous ultra-wide spectrum with very low efficiency (typically less than a few percent) and poor spectral tunability. In addition, the hundred-terawatts-order power incident laser pulses and Joules-order single pulses are required, which will require large, expensive laser devices. At present, only some large and medium laboratories have such laser devices with a repetition frequency of only a few Hertz and relatively poor stability, which greatly limits the practical use, application value, and scope of the scheme.",
                        "Therefore, there is an urgent need in the art to develop an efficient, small-size, and compact optical device with high repetition frequency, which generates multi-millijoule fewer-cycle mid-infrared light pulses with stable relativistic intensity, tunable spectral, and other pulse parameters."

With the advantages of high efficiency, small size and compactness, and high repetition frequency, the device of the present invention provides relativistic intense, multi-millijoule, near-single-cycle, ultra-short and ultra-intense mid-infrared light pulses with economical practicability and reliability, which not only is unattainable by the traditional optical device at present, but also breaks through the bottleneck of the traditional optical technology, and has potential wide application values for basic scientific research, medical and industrial applications. In addition, the conditions required by the method of the present invention are relatively simple, easy to implement, economical and practical, and there is a possibility of realizing high operating repetition frequency.",

According to the method of the present invention, the ultra-short driving laser pulse with the center wavelength of about 0.8-1.0 micrometers of the relativistic intensity of the terawatt-order (1 terawatt=1012 W) is transmitted in the thin plasma, and the signal laser pulse with the center wavelength of about 0.8-1.0 micrometers is modulated through the plasma electron density disturbance wake generated by the ultra-short driving laser pulse, and is converted into mid-infrared light pulses having a wavelength above 4 micrometers.",
                        "Implementation of the present invention requires a terawatt laser system and a vacuum target chamber where an adjustable high pressure gas nozzle device or capillary channel device is disposed for generating a plasma channel target with adjustable density and length. The laser system may employ a commercially available small-sized kilohertz-order femtosecond short pulse laser device. The pulse output by the device is divided into two laser pulses which are transmitted in the same direction, wherein the front pulse serves as a driving light pulse, and the rear pulse serves as a signal light pulse. The driving light pulse firstly interacts with a plasma channel target to generate a nonlinear plasma wake with a density cavitation bubble structure. By adjusting and controlling the time delay between the signal light pulse and the driving light pulse, the signal light pulse is injected into the leading edge region of the second plasma density cavitation bubble of the plasma wake generated by the driving light pulse, so that an intense frequency redshift effect occurs. After sufficient interaction and modulation, the signal light pulse is effectively converted into few-cycle mid-infrared pulse with energy up to multi-millijoule. The output mid-infrared pulse parameters, including its pulse energy, center frequency, spectral width, etc., are modulated by varying the parameters of the driving laser pulse, signal laser pulse, or plasma channel target.",
                        "Compared with the traditional technical method, the method of the present invention has the main advantages. Due to the limitation of frequency bandwidth, damage threshold, energy gain and so on, it is difficult to generate multi-millijoule few-cycle mid-infrared light pulses with high intensity based on traditional nonlinear crystalline materials. Currently, the energy of near-single-cycle mid-infrared pulse energies obtained based on crystalline materials optics technology is typically limited to tens of microjoules with peak intensity on the order of about terawatts per square centimeter. Based on the laser plasma optical method of the present invention, as there is no material loss threshold and other restrictions, the plasma can withstand laser pulses with extremely high power, intensity and energy, and is suitable for controlling and generating light pulses with high power, high energy, and high intensity. In addition, the generated mid-infrared pulse parameters can be conveniently regulated and controlled by simply changing plasma parameters or incident laser pulses.",
                        "Compared with other laser plasma methods, the method of the present invention has major advantages. Previously, the ultra-short and ultra-intense mid-infrared pulses are generated by self-modulation and self-compression of ultra-high power relativistic intense laser pulses in plasma, however, the mid-infrared pulses generated by the method are a continuous ultra-wide spectrum with very low efficiency (typically less than a few percent) and poor spectral tunability. In addition, large and expensive laser devices with hundred-terawatts-order powder and Joules-order energy are required. At present, only some medium and large laboratories have such laser with very low operating repetition frequency, typically only a few Hertz, and relatively poor stability. These greatly limit the practical use and application value of the mechanism scheme. The laser system required by the present invention employs the conventional commercial terawatt-order laser, which is smaller in size, economical and practical, and has higher stability and kilohertz-order repetition frequency so that the generated mid-infrared pulse is more convenient, stable, and reliable, thereby being more practical and wider in application ranges. In addition, the mid-infrared pulse efficiency converted by the method can reach about thirty percent of the incident signal light pulse energy and has adjustable wavelength and other pulse parameters.",
                        "Therefore, the present invention generates relativistic intense, multi-millijoule and few-cycle mid-infrared pulses with high repetition frequency and high-efficiency. The method of the present invention is superior to and different from the mid-infrared pulse obtained by self-modulation of the ultra-high power pulse in the plasma provided by others, and simultaneously breaks through the capability of the optical technology based on the nonlinear crystalline materials at present, which will bring economical, practical, stable, and reliable ultra-intense few-cycle mid-infrared light source to a wide range of scientific groups.",

The laser can employ a kilohertz-order laser device 2 which is commercially available at present and is stable, economical, and practical.",

The delay time is approximately 50-80 femtoseconds (comparable to the longitudinal length of the generated first plasma cavitation bubble (511 in FIG. 2)), so that the injected signal light pulse is locate in the density rising region at the leading edge of the second plasma cavitation bubble (512 in FIG. 2) in the wake, resulting in an intense frequency red-shift effect. After the modulation by sufficient interaction, the signal light is efficiently converted into long wavelength mid-infrared pulses 82.",
                        "The schematic diagram of the laser plasma wake, the modulated signal light pulse (82, i.e., mid-infrared pulse 7), and the driving light pulse (81) are shown in FIG. 2, and the on-axis density distribution of the plasma wake is shown in FIG. 3. The driving light pulses are mainly used for generating a density-perturbed wake by interaction with the plasma, which contains a plurality of plasma cavitation bubble. As the driving laser pulse itself is located in a region where the density disturbance is very mild (i.e., the leading edge of the first plasma cavitation bubble 511), though the legging edge portion of the driving laser pulse is also in the density rising region, it is difficult to generate a frequency red shift phenomenon, which is a pulse self-modulation mechanism. Therefore, the previous schemes based on pulse self-modulation all require a hundred-terawatt, Joule-order intense laser pulse to excite an intense density-perturbed wake to generate ultra-intense mid-infrared pulses. In addition, according to the self-modulation method, only a small part of laser pulse energy is converted into mid-infrared pulses, most of the energy will be absorbed by plasma to form a wakefield or generating high-energy electrons through acceleration, and the leading edge portion of the pulses is located in a density gradient descent region and cannot be converted into mid-infrared pulses. Thus, the conversion efficiency of pulse self-modulation methods is typically less than a few percent. In the present invention, since the signal light is located in a very high density rising region (i.e., the leading edge of the second plasma cavitation bubble 512), an intense frequency redshift phenomenon will occur. Since the density-perturbed wake is generated by the driving laser, it does not need to consume much signal light energy. The consumed signal laser energy primarily enhances the wake of the second plasma cavitation bubble in which it resides and is partially absorbed by the plasma, and the enhanced plasma wake in turn enhances the frequency red-shift effect. Thus, the signal laser can achieve fast and efficient frequency red-shift conversion, thereby generating ultra-short and ultra-intense mid-infrared pulses 82.",
