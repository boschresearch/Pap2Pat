# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to previously unknown therapeutic agents derived from novel signaling and biochemical pathways that use arachidonic acid (AA), which are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, omega-6) as precursors to the production of bioactive novel endogenous products that control physiologic events in inflammation and resolution in vascular endothelial reactions and neural systems (brain). More specifically, the present invention relates to di- and trihydroxy potent bioactive products termed “Lipoxins”, which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, therapeutic stable analogs of lipoxins that enhance their biologic properties are described that can be used to expedite resolution by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory amplification of leukocyte entry.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The normal cornea has no blood or lymphatic vessels. This feature is essential for corneal transparency and optimal visual performance, and contributes to the immunologic privilege of the cornea.

Neovascularization (NV) is a common complication secondary to various corneal diseases, including infection, degeneration, trauma and stem cell deficiency-induced insults. NV is also strongly associated with graft failure after corneal transplantation. Additionally, corneal NV as a result of viral or chlamydial (trachoma) infection is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide.

Corneal NV is a complex response to a number of stimuli, and involves a sequence of coordinated cellular and molecular mechanisms. Dilation of the existing limbal vessels followed by adhesion and diapedesis of leukocytes, such as neutrophils and macrophages, and migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (EC), in large part mediated by VEGF, are all important factors in NV pathogenesis (1,2,3).

Limited therapeutics are available to topically treat inflammation in the cornea that are also able to regulate unwanted neovascularization of the corneal tissue. Current anti-inflammatories for topical treatments in the eye, i.e., applied directly to the cornea, include steroids, which are well appreciated by the clinical community to have long-term deleterious side effects. Such side effects include well-known complications such as cataracts, infection and glaucoma.

A need therefore exists for an improved understanding of neovascularization as well as the isolation and preparation of bioactive agents that can serve to eliminate or diminish NV pathogenesis, especially associated with the cornea.

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention, in one embodiment, is drawn to isolated therapeutic agents generated from the interaction between a dietary omega-6 PUFA, such as arachidonic acid, an oxygenase, such as cyclooxygenase-II (COX-2), and an analgesic, such as aspirin (ASA). Surprisingly, careful and challenging isolation of previously unknown and unappreciated compounds are generated from exudates by the combination of components in an appropriate environment to provide di- and tri-hydroxy AA derivatives having unique structural and physiological properties. The present invention therefore provides for many new useful therapeutic di- and tri-hydroxy derivatives of AA, lipoxins, that diminish, prevent, or eliminate NV, hemangiogenesis or angiogenic conditions associated with corneal tissue.

Lipoxins, such as ATLa (15-epi-16-(p-fluorophenoxy)-LXA4 methyl ester) are novel anti-inflammatory lipid mediators derived from omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid. At the local site of inflammation, aspirin treatment enhances AA conversion to 15R-oxygenated products including ATLa that carry potent anti-inflammatory signals. Surprisingly, lipoxins (such as those identified throughout the specification) such as ATLa protected against, reduced or inhibited the development of NV, hemangiogenesis and/or angiogenesis, in a well appreciated experimental mouse model.

The beneficial effect was reflected by decreased generation or elimination of neovascularization. Thus, the novel endogenous lipid mediators termed “lipoxins”, such as ATLa counterregulate leukocyte-mediated tissue injury and pro-inflammatory gene expression. These findings show a novel endogenous mechanism that may underlie the beneficial actions of omega-6 AA and provides new approaches for the treatment of undesirable NV, hemangiogenesis or angiogenic conditions in the cornea.

Lymphangiogenesis, an important initial step in tumor metastasis and transplant sensitization, is mediated by the action of VEGF-C and -D on VEGFR3. Lymphangiogenesis is the structural organization of the lymphatic vessels and their growth

Angiogenesis, the outgrowth of new from preexisting blood vessels, is an important pathogenic aspect of tumor growth, chronic inflammatory diseases, and most blinding ocular conditions. To clearly separate it from the process of lymphangiogenesis, it should be understood that blood vascular angiogenesis is referred to as hemangiogenesis (HA). In recent years, much has been learned about the stimulators and inhibitors of HA and lymphangiogenesis, and members of the VEGF family have emerged as prime mediators of both processes. The VEGF growth factor family consists of five members that bind to and activate three distinct receptors. VEGF-A binds to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and placental growth factor (P1GF) and VEGF-B bind only to VEGFR1. VEGF-C and VEGF-D bind to VEGFR2 and VEGFR3.

VEGF-A has emerged as the family member principally responsible for normal vasculogenesis and HA. The direct effects of VEGF-A on vascular endothelial cells are mediated principally via VEGFR2 ligation, while, until recently, VEGFR1 was thought to mediate mainly inhibitory or decoy functions. VEGF-A also plays a predominant role in diverse forms of pathological angiogenesis, including those requisite for the rapid growth of solid tumors. For this reason many antiangiogenic agents currently in development for the treatment of cancers have targeted VEGF-A or VEGFR2.

In contrast to HA, lymphangiogenesis is thought to be mediated mainly by the binding of VEGF-C and -D to their high-affinity receptor, VEGFR3. Like HA, lymphangiogenesis has gained much attention recently as an important initial step in tumor pathogenesis. It has been shown that intra- and/or peritumoral lymphangiogenesis increases the risk for metastasis both in animal models and in human tumors. The release of the lymphangiogenic growth factors VEGF-C and -D has been linked to a circulating subfraction of CD14+, VEGFR3-expressing monocytes that are recruited to and activated at the site of tumor growth.

Lipoxins are lipid mediators generated from an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid that is the first dual anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals identified in the resolution phase of inflammation. Here the potential of aspirin-triggered lipoxin(LX)A4 analog (ATLa) was investigated in regulating angiogenesis in a corneal neovascularization (NV) murine system in vivo, in which sutures or micropellets containing IL-1β or VEGF-A were placed.

It was determined that the receptors for LXA4 and ALX/Fpr-rs2 were each expressed by the epithelium, stromal fibroblasts, and CD11b+ cells, in both normal and inflamed corneas. Mice were treated with ATLa subconjunctivally (100 ng/10 μl) at 48 h intervals. The control NV group was treated with vehicle only. ATLa-treated eyes had reduced numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. The mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-β, VEGF, VEGF-C, and VEGFR2 were significantly reduced after treatment with these lipid mediators, compared to the control group. Animals treated with these mediators had significantly suppressed suture-induced or IL-1β-induced hemoangiogenesis (HA), but not lymphangiogenesis. Interestingly, ATLa treatment significantly suppressed VEGF-A-induced HA.

These results suggest that ATLa reduces inflammatory corneal HA by early regulation of resolution mechanisms in innate immune responses. In addition, ATLa directly inhibits VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis and is a potent inhibitor of NV among this new genus of dual anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators.

The present invention provides that lipoxins, such as ATLa, significantly reduce neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, accompanied by down-regulation in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic growth factors and receptors. Moreover, these changes have a significantly greater effect in reducing hemoangiogenesis (HA) than lymphangiogenesis (LA).

### Results

**LipoxinA4 Receptor Expression in the Cornea**

The expression of the receptor for ATLa in corneal tissue by RT-PCR was determined. In the normal corneas, Fpr-rs2 (one of the murine LXA4 receptors), but not Fprl1 (another murine LXA4 receptor), were present in both the epithelial and stromal-endothelial layers (FIG. 1).

To further delineate whether corneal keratocytes versus immunocytic CD11b+ cells (i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells) in the corneal stroma express these receptors, MK/T-1 cells (an immortalized corneal keratocyte cell line) were cultured and stimulated with TNF-α and IL-1β to mimic in situ corneal inflammation. RT-RCR results showed Fpr-rs2 was expressed by MK/T-1 cells irrespective of cytokine stimulation. In addition, the infiltrated CD11b+ cells, sorted from the inflamed corneas, also expressed high levels of Fpr-rs2 (FIG. 1).

Application with ATLa Reduces Neutrophil and Macrophage Infiltration

Next, inflamed corneas were treated with ATLa to assess the action of the lipid mediator on the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages (FIG. 2). An approximate 30% inhibition of neutrophils recruitment (p<0.05) into the inflamed corneas was observed at 24 and 72 h with the administration of ATLa (neutrophils; 24 h: 53±1 cells/section, 72 h: 34±5 cells/section, n=3), compared to the vehicle-treated group (neutrophils; 24 h: 81±6 cells/section, 72 h: 57±4 cells/section, n=3). Similarly, macrophage infiltration was also reduced, but this was only observed at 72 h after suture placement: ATLa (macrophage; 46±5 cells/section, n=3) resulted in a 25-40% (p<0.05) reduction in macrophage infiltration compared to the vehicle control group (macrophage; 83±3 cells/section, n=3).

Application with ATLa Reduces Inflammatory Cytokine Expression

The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α, were monitored by real-time PCR at 24 h and 72 h after suture placement (FIG. 3). Treatment with ATLa led to a more than 50% reduction in the increase of IL-1β expression levels compared to the vehicle-treated controls (p<0.05) after induction of corneal inflammation. Increases in TNF-α expression were also significantly suppressed by the mediator at 24 h, but not at 72 h. The expression of IL-1α was not significantly altered by the lipid mediator (FIG. 3). It was also confirmed protein levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β using ELISA in the different treatment groups. Similar to RNA levels, ATLa-treated group shows 70% decrease in IL-1β protein level compared to vehicle-treated group (P<0.001, FIG. 7).

**ATLa Impacts the Expression of VEGFs and VEGFRs**

To determine the effect of ATLa in modulation of angiogenesis, mRNA expression was measured for the critical ligands (VEGF-A, C, D) and receptors (VEGFR-2, 3) involved in angiogenesis (FIG. 4). In contrast to the vehicle-treated group, the ATLa application group had lower mRNA expressions of the angiogenic growth factors, VEGF-A, C and their receptor, VEGFR-2, at 24 h and 72 h after suture placement. However, the mRNA expression for the lymphangiogeneic growth factor, VEGF-D and its receptor, VEGFR-3, were not significantly altered in the ATLa group relative to the vehicle-treated controls.

**Evaluation of Clinical Corneal NV and Histological Assessment of HA and LA**

The growth of corneal neovessels was measured over a 2-week time course via slit lamp biomicroscopy. Use of corneal sutures in this model induces inflammatory NV within 2 days and peaks approximately 2 weeks post manipulation as described previously.14 It was observed that application with the lipid mediator led to significant suppression of the angiogenic response, relative to the vehicle control (FIG. 5). It was further compared the density of the blood vessels (BV) and lymphatic vessels (LV) using whole-mounted corneas harvested from the different groups, and co-stained these with anti-CD31 and anti-LYVE-1 (BV are CD31high/LYVE-1−, while the LV are CD31lowLYVE-1high). Consistent with slit-lamp observations, by day 14 after suture placement the BV density was significantly suppressed with ATLa (8.26±0.63%, n=6) application, relative to vehicle application (23.18±1.12%, n=6). Interestingly, significant changes in the density of lymphatic vessels among the lipid mediator groups relative to the vehicle controls were not observed.

ATLa Regulation of IL-β and VEGF-A induced-HA

To further dissect the direct regulatory actions of these lipid mediators on VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis versus a more ‘indirect’ inhibitory effect on angiogenesis via suppression of innate immune responses, HA and LA were measured after intrastromal placement of micropellets loaded with IL-1β- or VEGF-A. Quantitative analysis of corneal flat-mounts harvested from VEGF-A micropellet stimulation showed that the BV density in the group treated with ATLa (5.9±0.4%, n=4) was significantly lower relative to vehicle treatment (14.75±3.8%, n=4). Vessel growth stimulated by IL-1β-micropellets was more marked than that with VEGF-A stimulation. Nonetheless, treatment with ATLa (BV density; 16.1±3.0%, n=4) significantly impaired IL-1β-induced BV growth, relative to vehicle treatment (BV density; 26.8±2.0%, n=4). Interestingly, and corroborating with previous observations in suture-induced corneal NV, no significant reduction of LA stimulated by either IL-1β- or VEGF-A was observed with any of these mediator treatments (FIG. 6).

### Discussion

The present invention provides that the lipid mediator, ATLa regulates VEGF-A/-C and VEGFR2 and as a result, significantly reduces the development of NV in the inflamed cornea, in addition to their resolving effects on innate immunity. The present invention also provides that corneal tissues and infiltrating innate immune cells express Fpr-rs2 (the LXA4 receptor); the ligation of which directly suppress angiogenesis. In the aggregate, these results in a model of surgically induced corneal inflammation and angiogenesis confirm the functions of ATLa as potent dual anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution molecules that can also effectively stop angiogenesis.

The neutrophil is the most prominent and earliest cell to migrate into the cornea in the early stages of inflammation, and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators can promote resolution by shortening the duration of neutrophil tissue infiltration.25 In line with this current understanding, the present invention provides that the administration of ATLa indeed blocked neutrophil infiltration of the cornea at 24 h and 72 h post insult—a time point which coincided with the down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1-α, and IL-1-β) expression known to be secreted by innate immunocytes, in particular neutrophils. Moreover, the data also show that macrophage infiltration is also reduced significantly after local administration of ATLa. These results highlight the importance of neutrophil infiltration in the local chemotaxis of subsequent immunocyte populations such as the macrophage. It has been shown that ATLa can also increase macrophage phagocytosis (e.g. of apoptotic neutrophils) and this may also contribute to the resolution of inflammation following treatments.26 Taken together, local administration of these lipid mediators to the cornea control local innate immune cell infiltration and enhance the resolution of inflammation.

While the healthy or normal cornea is avascular, local inflammation can stimulate the ingrowth of neovessels from the surrounding limbal and conjunctival areas through secretion of pro-angiogenesis factors by local vascular endothelial and inflammatory cells. Cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-1α, and TNF-α, are known to enhance the expression of angiogenic factors.27-29 Among all the angiogenic factors, the VEGF species play a pivotal role in vascular development. Ligation of VEGFR2 by VEGF-A is critical in vascular EC proliferation and differentiation in hemangiogenesis. On the other hand, binding of VEGF-C/-D to VEGFR3 stimulates the development of lymphatic vessels. In addition, VEGF-C can also bind and activate VEGFR2,30,31 and thereby contribute to HA, despite having a weaker binding affinity than VEGF-A.32 Interestingly, the present invention provides that treatments with ATLa significantly reduced the gene expression levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and their receptor VEGFR2, but not VEGF-D or VEGFR3. This indicates that such treatments selectively regulate HA, rather than LA, and this was further supported by immunohistochemistry.

While IL-1 secretion can stimulate VEGF expression and thereby promote angiogenesis, administration of exogenous VEGF-A can achieve a similar effect (possibly independent of other downstream effectors resulting from IL-1 signaling). The present invention determined whether the suppression of corneal NV by ATLa is due to suppression of IL-1β and/or VEGF-A stimulation.

Interestingly, however, the present invention indicated that ATLa treatment not only reduced IL-1β induced corneal angiogenesis, but also that induced by VEGF-stimulation. The exclusive ability to suppress VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis by ATLa treatment, could be in part, result from impairment in the early stage of EC migration.35 It is also noteworthy that relative to the other treatments, ATLa is thought to be active for a longer duration as it is a stable analog of LXA4/ATL which resists local inactivation.36 Moroever, ATLa exerts its inhibitory effects on multiple steps of the VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis, such as inhibition of EC adhesion,37,38 and suppression of VEGF-A-induced EC proliferation.39 These factors explain the actions of ATLa and its demonstrable higher potency in suppressing angiogenesis.

LXA4's anti-inflammation and pro-resolution functions are related to the receptor ALX/FPRL1, which has been identified on neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, epithelial cells and keratocyte in humans. This function is subserved by multiple receptors in the murine system, including Lxa4r/Fprl1 and Fpr-rs2 which share 89% and 83% homology at the nucleotide and protein levels, respectively.37 The present invention provides that Fpr-rs2 but not Lxa4r/Fprl1, are expressed by the infiltrating CD11b+ cells (which include macrophages, and monocytic dendritic cells, and a subset of neutrophils) in the cornea. These results suggest that ATLa activation of Fpr-rs2 on these CD11b+ immunocytes stops their local migration and cytokine production into cornea.

Finally, it is noteworthy that while the expression of ALX in the cornea has been implicated in epithelial cell proliferation in a wound healing model,41,42 the location of ALX in the cornea had not been established to date. Here, for the first time, the present invention distinguished the distribution of Fpr-rs2 in the cornea, which include epithelial cells and stromal keratocytes in both normal and inflammatory conditions. In conclusion, ATLa effectively resolves corneal inflammation and angiogenesis by controlling innate inflammation via marked reduction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion and inhibiting VEGF/VEGFR expression. These novel lipid mediators offer a potentially new therapeutic strategy in controlling corneal angiogenesis, a leading cause of visual blindness worldwide.

### Methods

**Animals**

Six to eight-week-old male BALB/c (Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y.) mice were used in all experiments. All experimental protocols were approved by the Schepens Eye Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee, and all animals were treated according to the Association for Research in Vision and Opthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

**Suture-Induced Inflammatory Corneal Angiogenesis**

The standard model for induction of inflammatory corneal NV is associated with development of intrastromal vessels in close association with a mixed-cell (primarily neutrophilic) infiltrate.14,15 Three interrupted sutures (11-0 nylon, Sharpoint; Vanguard, Houston, Tex.) were placed intrastromally with two stromal incursions extending over 120° of the corneal circumference each to induce inflammatory corneal NV, which is also associated with significant LA, as described previously.14 The corneas were followed by slit-lamp biomicroscopy for corneal NV development. NV was graded between 0 and 3, with increments of 0.5, using a grid system per each corneal quadrant based on the centripetal extent of the neovascular branches from the limbus. Scores for each quadrant then summed to derive the NV index (range 0 to 12) for each eye, as previously described.14

**Corneal Micropocket Assay**

The corneal micropocket assay in mice and quantification of the resultant NV has been described previously.16,17 In brief, 0.3 μl of hydron pellets (IFN Sciences, New Brunswick, N.J.) containing 30 ng of murine IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) or 200 ng of VEGF-A (gift from BRB Preclinical Repository, National Cancer Institute) were prepared and implanted into the corneal stroma of male BALB/c mice. After 7 days the animals were sacrificed and the corneas were harvested for quantitative analysis of HA and LA.

**Ocular Administration of Compounds**

BALB/c mice were randomized to receive ATLa, or vehicle (normal saline) by subconjunctival injection in a masked fashion after suture or hydron pellet placement. The compounds were administered at a dose of 100 ng/10 μl per mouse every 48 h after suture or pellet placed. ATLa was synthesized as described previously.20 The physical properties were monitored routinely via LC/MS/MS matching the reported biological and physical properties prior to analysis in present experiments.

**RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR**

Corneas were carefully dissected to ensure that the conjunctival and iris tissues were not included. To extract mRNA from whole-thickness corneas, two corneas were pooled as a sample in each group. To extract mRNA from corneal epithelial and stroma-endothelial layers separately, intact corneas were placed in 30 μl of RNA stabilization reagent (RNAlater, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) at 4° C. overnight and then stored at −30° C. for 2-3 days. After incubated in 250 μl 20 mM EDTA (sterile, pH 7.4) at 37° C. for 30 minutes, the epithelial layers were peeled off the stroma-endothelial layers before mRNA isolation. Ten corneal epithelial layers or stroma-endothelial layers were pooled as a sample in each group. The mRNA isolated from submandibular lymph nodes were used as positive controls.

A combined-method for total RNA isolation was employed, using Trizol (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif.) and RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), as described previously.21 Reverse transcription of total RNA was conducted using oligo(dT)20 primer and Superscript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). PCR was conducted using primer pairs for Fprl1 (sense GATGCTAGAGGGGATGTGCAC, antisense TCTTCAGGAAGTGAAGCC, 530 bp), Fpr-rs2 (sense TGCTGTCAAGATCAACAGAAG, antisense TGCCAGGAGGTGAAGTAGAAC, 359 bp) and GAPDH (sense GAAGGGCATCTTGGGCTACAC, antisense GCAGCGAACTTTATTGATGGTATT, 373 bp). The PCR conditions were 35 cycles at 95° C. for 30 seconds, 56° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 1 minute, followed by finial extension at 72° C. for 10 minutes. PCR products were observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The mean density of each band was measured by using NIH image J software. The density of each receptor band was divided by the density of the corresponding GAPDH band to obtain the normalized band density.

**Real-Time PCR**

1 μl of total cDNA, synthesized from 400 ng total RNA with random hexamers using Superscript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), was loaded in each well and assays were performed in triplicates. Quantitative PCR was performed with Taqman Universal PCR Mastermix and FAM-MGB dye labeled predesigned primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) for IL-1α (Mm 99999060_ml), TNF-α (Mm99999068_ml), IL-1β (Mm00434228_ml), VEGFR2 (Mm00440099_ml), VEGFR3 (Mm00433337_ml), VEGFA (Mm00437304_ml), VEGFC (Mm00437313_ml). PCR conditions were 2 minutes at 50° C., 10 minutes at 95° C., followed by 35 cycles of 15 second at 95° C. and 60° C. for 1 minute using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems, CA). PCR amplification of the house-keeping gene encoding GAPDH (Mm999999915_gl) was performed during each run for each sample to allow normalization between samples. A nontemplate control was included in all the experiments to evaluate DNA contamination of isolated RNA and reagents. The results were analyzed by comparative threshold cycle (CT) method. The relative expression level of each sample was expressed as fold change from normal control.

**Isolation of Cornea-Infiltrating Cells**

Forty corneas were pooled, teased with scissors, and digested with collagenase D (Roche Applied Science, 11088874103) at 37° C. for 1 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After incubation, corneas were disrupted by grinding with a syringe plunger.22-24 Total cells were then collected after passing through a steel mesh. Upon blockade by anti-FcR mAb, these cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD11b (granulocyte/monocyte/macrophage marker, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) at 4° C. for 30 minutes. CD11b+ cells were sorted from total cells by using MoFlo® High-Performance Cell Sorter (Cytomation, Fort Colins, Colo.).

**MK/T-1 Cell Culture and Stimulation**

MK/T-1 cells, immortalized keratocytes from the corneal stroma of C57BL/6 mouse (gift from R. L. Gendron [Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada]), were used to identify the expression of lipid mediator receptors on the corneal keratocytes. MK/T-1 cells were grown in low-glucose Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM a-glutamine at 37° C. in 5% CO2. To stimulate MK/T-1 cells, 10 ng/μl TNF-α (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) and 10 ng/μl IL-1β were added in the culture medium.

**Immunohistochemical Studies**

Full thickness corneal tissue or 8 μm-frozen sections were fixed in acetone for 15 minutes at room temperature. To block non-specific staining, anti-FcR mAb (CD16/CD31, FcγIII/II receptor) or 10% goat serum was used before primary antibodies or isotype-matched control antibodies were applied at 4° C. overnight. Thereafter, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies at RT. Each step was followed by three thorough washings in PBS for 5-10 minutes. Finally, the samples were covered with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy (Eclipse E800; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The following antibodies were used: FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD31 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.), purified rat anti-mouse neutrophil (NIMP-R14, Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.), purified rat anti-mouse F4/80 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, Colo.) and purified rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.). The secondary antibodies were Rodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Rodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.). Isotype controls included FITC-conjugated rat IgG2a, purified rat IgG2b, and purified rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.).

To quantify corneal angiogenesis, digital pictures of corneal flat-mounts were taken using an image analysis system (Spot Image Analysis, Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, Mich.). The areas covered by CD31high/LYVE-1−-vessels (blood vessels) or CD31lowLYVE-1high vessels (lymphatics) were measured morphometrically using NIH Image J software (version 1.34s; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). The total corneal area was outlined using the inner-most vessel of the limbal arcade as the border. The vessel density was calculated by the proportion of neovascularized area to the whole corneal area.

**Statistics**

All data are expressed as means ±SEM. Statistical significance between the vehicle and each lipid mediator group was analyzed by the two-tailed t-test with Prism (version 4.0; GraphPad, SanDiego, Calif.).

The present invention is drawn to methods for treating disease states or conditions that are associated with inflammation. The recruitment of neutrophils, leukocytes and/or cytokines are included within the general scope of NV, hemangiogenesis and/or angiogenic condition(s) of corneal tissue that can be treated by unexpectedly lipoxins.

Given the cellular origins of the different chambers of the eye, it is not possible to assume that the same targets are present in the front or cornea of the eye versus the retina or any other part of the eye; each need to be established separately both in experimental laboratory settings in animals and with the rigor of clinical trials in human studies.

The eye, being a highly specialized sensory organ, has cells in the anterior chamber that differ in their origin from cells in the posterior chamber. Therefore, therapeutic approaches and current treatments of the cornea vs. retinal layer and sclera retinal-gliral scleral layer are not and cannot be assumed to be the same.

Because of the anatomical structural and functional differences in each section of the eye, therapeutics need to be targeted to precise locations within the eye, for example, cornea vs. retina, in order to achieve appropriate therapeutic interventions. The cell types and their pathologies in these sections of the human eye are different.

A point of fact that the cornea versus the retina are physiologically of a different ilk has given rise to very different study groups at the national level as currently considered by the NIH. For example, the anterior portion of the eye and associated structures, e.g. the cornea, canal of Schlemm, lens, etc. are addressed by a specific study section at the level of the NIH, whereas structures of the posterior chamber and section of the eye including retina, optic nerve, etc. are addressed by a separate study section. This is because the tissue and cell types from the posterior of the eye are largely of neural origin or highly specialized non-photosensitive epithelial layers, such as in the retina, whereas cells in the cornea are nonvascular, non-refractive epithelial cells. It is these cell type differences and anatomical differences that give rise to different treatment distinctions.

Agents that act on cells of the human retina (anti-VEGF therapies, etc.) do not have specific targeted actions within the healthy human cornea per se and current therapies along these lines need to be injected within the vitreous body posterior chamber of the eye. These treatments include, for example, anti-VEGF therapies.

The present surprisingly demonstrates the unique suture model of angiogenesis in the cornea and lipoxins are able to protect from neovascularization of corneal tissues. Without this experimental evidence put forth in the specification, this could not be anticipated or was predictable.

More importantly, limited therapeutics are available to topically treat inflammation in the cornea that are also able to regulate unwanted neovascularization of the corneal tissue. Current anti-inflammatories for topical treatments in the eye, i.e., applied directly to the cornea, include steroids, which are well appreciated by the clinical community to have long-term deleterious side effects.

The current findings that lipoxins are anti-inflammatory topically as well as prevent neovascularization in a cornea suture model is an ideal example of novel dual-pronged actions of the lipoxins in cornea. In the cornea, neovascularization is unwanted as it can limit vision.

Corneal replacements are routinely carried out and can be associated in humans with suture-induced/initiated local inflammation. Topical application of lipoxins as demonstrated for the first time in direct comparison from the present results could be useful in the treatment of this currently unmet clinical need.

“Protecting group” refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group may be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., 1999, John Wiley & Sons, NY and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Representative nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (“CBZ”), tert-butoxycarbonyl (“Boc”), trimethylsilyl (“TMS”), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (“TES”), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (“FMOC”), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (“NVOC”) and the like. Representative hydroxyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxyl group is either acylated (esterified) or alkylated such as benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups), glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol derivatives and allyl ethers.

Throughout the following descriptions, it should be understood that where particular double bonding is depicted, it is intended to include both cis and trans configurations. Exemplary formulae are provided with specific configurations, but for completeness, the double bonds can be varied. Not every structural isomer is shown in efforts to maintain brevity of the specification. However, this should not be considered limiting in nature. Additionally, where synthetic schemes are provided, it should be understood that all cis/trans configurational isomers are also contemplated and are within the scope and purvue of the synthesis. Again, particular double bonding is depicted in exemplary manner.

The hydroxyl(s) in the lipoxin analogs can be protected by various protecting groups (P), such as those known in the art. An artisan skilled in the art can readily determine which protecting group(s) may be useful for the protection of the hydroxyl group(s). Standard methods are known in the art and are more fully described in literature. For example, suitable protecting groups can be selected by the skilled artisan and are described in Green and Wuts, “Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Chapters 5 and 7, 1991, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred protecting groups include methyl and ethyl ethers, TMS or TIPPS groups, acetate (esters) or propionate groups and glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol derivatives.

For example, one or more hydroxyl groups can be treated with a mild base, such as triethylamine in the presence of an acid chloride or silyl chloride to facilitate a reaction between the hydroxyl ion and the halide. Alternatively, an alkyl halide can be reacted with the hydroxyl ion (generated by a base such as lithium diisopropyl amide) to facilitate ether formation.

It should also be understood that for the lipoxin analogs, not all hydroxyl groups need be protected. One, two or all three hydroxyl groups can be protected. This can be accomplished by the stoichiometric choice of reagents used to protect the hydroxyl groups. Methods known in the art can be used to separate the di- or tri-protected hydroxy compounds, e.g., HPLC, LC, flash chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, crystallization, distillation, etc.

It should be understood that there are one or more chiral centers in each of the above-identified compounds. It should understood that the present invention encompasses all stereochemical forms, e.g., enantiomers, diastereomers and racemates of each compound. Where asymmetric carbon atoms are present, more than one stereoisomer is possible, and all possible isomeric forms are intended to be included within the structural representations shown. Optically active (R) and (S) isomers may be resolved using conventional techniques known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The present invention is intended to include the possible diastereiomers as well as the racemic and optically resolved isomers.

Where carbon carbon double bonds exist, the configurational chemistry can be either cis (Z) or trans (E) and the depictions throughout the specification are not meant to be limiting. The depictions are, in general, presented based upon the configurational chemistry of related AA compounds, and although not to be limited by theory, are believed to possess similar configuration chemistry.

Throughout the specification carbon carbon bonds in particular have been “distorted” for ease to show how the bonds may ultimately be positioned relative one to another. For example, it should be understood that acetylenic portions of the lipoxins actually do include a geometry of approximately 180 degress, however, for aid in understanding of the synthesis and relationship between the final product(s) and starting materials, such angles have been obfuscated to aid in comprehension.

It should be understood that hydrogenation of acetylenic portions of the lipoxin analog may result in one or more products.

It is intended that all possible products are included within this specification. For example, hydrogenation of acetylenic lipoxin analogs can produce a mixture of products—monoethylene products (cis or trans “monoene”-acetylene; acetylene-cis or trans “monoene”. All products can be separated and identified by HPLC, GC, MS, NMR, IR.

Known techniques in the art can be used to convert the carboxylic acid/ester functionality of the lipoxin into carboxamides, thioesters, nitrile, carbamates, thiocarbamates, etc. and are incorporated herein. The appropriate moieties, such as amides, can be further substituted as is known in the art.

In general, the lipoxin analogs of the invention are bioactive as alcohols. Enzymatic action or reactive oxygen species attack at the site of inflammation or degradative metabolism. Such interactions with the hydroxyl(s) of the lipoxin molecule can eventually reduce physiological activity as depicted below:

The use of “R” groups with secondary bioactive alcohols, in particular, serves to increase the bioavailability and bioactivity of the lipoxin by inhibiting or diminishing the potential for oxidation of the alcohol to a ketone producing an inactive metabolite. The R “protecting groups” include, for example, linear and branched, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkylaryl groups, phenoxy groups, and halogens.

Generally the use of “R protection chemistry” is not necessary with vicinal diols within the lipoxin. Typically vicinal diols are not as easily oxidized and therefore, generally do not require such protection by substitution of the hydrogen atom adjacent to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group. Although it is generally considered that such protection is not necessary, it is possible to prepare such compounds where each of the vicinal diol hydroxyl groups, independently, could be “protected” by the substitution of the hydrogen atom adjacent to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group with an “R protecting group” as described above.

In one embodiment, Q1 is a carbonyl, X is a hydroxyl or an —OR, wherein R is an alkyl group, i.e., methyl or ethyl groups, and R4 is a hydrogen atom.

In other embodiments, Y1 is a hydroxyl and the carbon bearing the hydroxyl can have an R or S configuration. In most preferred embodiments, the chiral carbon bearing the hydroxyl group, e.g., Y1, is designated as a 15-epi-lipoxin as is known in the art.

In certain embodiments the chirality of the carbons bearing the R2, R3, Q3 and Q4 groups can each independently be either R or S. In preferred embodiments, Q3 and Q4 have the chiralities shown in above-referenced structures.

In preferred embodiments, R4 is a hydrogen. In other preferred embodiments, R6 is a hydrogen.

Additionally, R5 can be a substituted or unsubstituted, branched or unbranched alkyl group having between 1 and about 6 carbon atoms, preferably between 1 and 4 carbon atoms, most preferably between 1 and 3, and preferably one or two carbon atoms. The carbon atoms can have substituents which include halogen atoms, hydroxyl groups, or ether groups.

The compounds useful in the present invention can be prepared by the following synthetic scheme:

wherein X, Q1, Q3, Q4, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, Y1 and T are as defined above. Suitable methods known in the art to can be used to produce each fragment. For example, the acetylenic fragment can be prepared by the methods discussed in Nicolaou, K. C. et al. (1991) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 30:1100; Nicolaou, K. C. et al. (1989) J. Org. Chem. 54:5527; Webber, S. E. et al. (1988) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 229:61; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,951. The second fragment can be prepared by the methods of Raduchel, B. and Vorbruggen, H. (1985) Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 14:263. As a consequence, the acetylenic intermediates are also encompassed by the present invention as being useful for the treatments of the various maladies described herein.

Purity of compounds noted throughout the specification is at least 80% pure, in particular, greater than 90% pure, more particularly greater than 95% pure and most particularly greater than about 99% pure, based on analytical measurements such has GC, MS, or 1 HNMR, etc. This applies to all compounds noted herein, whether isolated and/or purified, throughout the specification.

A “lipoxin analog” shall mean a compound which has an “active region” that functions like the active region of a “natural lipoxin”, but which has a “metabolic transformation region” that differs from natural lipoxin. Lipoxin analogs include compounds which are structurally similar to a natural lipoxin, compounds which share the same receptor recognition site, compounds which share the same or similar lipoxin metabolic transformation region as lipoxin, and compounds which are art-recognized as being analogs of lipoxin. Lipoxin analogs include lipoxin analog metabolites. The compounds disclosed herein may contain one or more centers of asymmetry. Where asymmetric carbon atoms are present, more than one stereoisomer is possible, and all possible isomeric forms are intended to be included within the structural representations shown. Optically active (R) and (S) isomers may be resolved using conventional techniques known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. The present invention is intended to include the possible diastereiomers as well as the racemic and optically resolved isomers.

The terms “corresponding lipoxin” and “natural lipoxin” refer to a naturally-occurring lipoxin or lipoxin metabolite. Where an analog has activity for a lipoxin-specific receptor, the corresponding or natural lipoxin is the normal ligand for that receptor. For example, where an analog is a LXA4 specific receptor on differentiated HL-60 cells, the corresponding lipoxin is LXA4. Where an analog has activity as an antagonist to another compound (such as leukotriene C4 and/or leukotriene D4), which is antagonized by a naturally-occurring lipoxin, that natural lipoxin is the corresponding lipoxin.

“Active region” shall mean the region of a natural lipoxin or lipoxin analog, which is associated with in vivo cellular interactions. The active region may bind the “recognition site” of a cellular lipoxin receptor or a macromolecule or complex of macromolecules, including an enzyme and its cofactor. For example, lipoxin A4 analogs have an active region comprising C5-C15 of natural lipoxin A4. Similarly, for example, lipoxin B4 analogs have an active region comprising C5-C14 of natural lipoxin B4.

The term “recognition site” or receptor is art-recognized and is intended to refer generally to a functional macromolecule or complex of macromolecules with which certain groups of cellular messengers, such as hormones, leukotrienes, or lipoxins must first interact before the biochemical and physiological responses to those messengers are initiated. As used in this application, a receptor may be isolated, on an intact or permeabilized cell, or in tissue, including an organ. A receptor may be from or in a living subject, or it may be cloned. A receptor may normally exist or it may be induced by a disease state, by an injury, or by artificial means. A compound of this invention may bind reversibly, irreversibly, competitively, noncompetitively, or uncompetitively with respect to the natural substrate of a recognition site.

The term “metabolic transformation region” is intended to refer generally to that portion of a lipoxin, a lipoxin metabolite, or lipoxin analog including a lipoxin analog metabolite, upon which an enzyme or an enzyme and its cofactor attempts to perform one or more metabolic transformations which that enzyme or enzyme and cofactor normally transform on lipoxins. The metabolic transformation region may or may not be susceptible to the transformation. A nonlimiting example of a metabolic transformation region of a lipoxin is a portion of LXA4 that includes the C-13,14 double bond or the C-15 hydroxyl group, or both.

The term “detectable label molecule” is meant to include fluorescent, phosphorescent, and radiolabeled molecules used to trace, track, or identify the compound or receptor recognition site to which the detectable label molecule is bound. The label molecule may be detected by any of the several methods known in the art.

The term “labeled analog” is further understood to encompass compounds which are labeled with radioactive isotopes, such as but not limited to tritium (3H), deuterium (2H), carbon (14C), or otherwise labeled (e.g. fluorescently). The compounds of this invention may be labeled or derivatized, for example, for kinetic binding experiments, for further elucidating metabolic pathways and enzymatic mechanisms, or for characterization by methods known in the art of analytical chemistry.

The term “inhibits metabolism” means the blocking or reduction of activity of an enzyme which metabolizes a native molecule. The blockage or reduction may occur by covalent bonding, by irreversible binding, by reversible binding which has a practical effect of irreversible binding, or by any other means which prevents the enzyme from operating in its usual manner on another lipoxin analog, including a lipoxin analog metabolite, a lipoxin, or a lipoxin metabolite.

The term “resists metabolism” is meant to include failing to undergo one or more of the metabolic degradative transformations by at least one of the enzymes which metabolize lipoxins. Two nonlimiting examples of LXA4 analog that resists metabolism are 1) a structure which can not be oxidized to the 15-oxo form, and 2) a structure which may be oxidized to the 15-oxo form, but is not susceptible to enzymatic reduction to the 13,14-dihydro form.

The term “more slowly undergoes metabolism” means having slower reaction kinetics, or requiring more time for the completion of the series of metabolic transformations by one or more of the enzymes which metabolize lipoxin or lipoxin analogs. A nonlimiting example of a LXA4 analog which more slowly undergoes metabolism is a structure which has a higher transition state energy for C-15 dehydrogenation than does LXA4 because the analog is sterically hindered at the C-16.

The term “tissue” is intended to include intact cells, blood, blood preparations such as plasma and serum, bones, joints, muscles, smooth muscles, and organs.

The term “subject” is intended to include living organisms susceptible to conditions or diseases caused or contributed bacteria, pathogens, disease states or conditions as generally disclosed, but not limited to, throughout this specification. Examples of subjects include humans, dogs, cats, cows, goats, and mice. The term subject is further intended to include transgenic species.

When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and mammals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient, i.e., at least one lipoxin, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting a compound(s) of the present invention within or to the subject such that it can perform its intended function. Typically, such compounds are carried or transported from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.

In certain embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides, and prodrugs” as used herein refers to those carboxylate salts, amino acid addition salts, esters, amides, and prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use of the compounds of the invention. The term “salts” refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. These may include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as well as non-toxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations including, but not limited to ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, and the like. (See, for example, Berge S. M., et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” J. Pharm. Sci., 1977; 66:1-19 which is incorporated herein by reference).

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable esters” refers to the relatively non-toxic, esterified products of the compounds of the present invention. These esters can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form or hydroxyl with a suitable esterifying agent. Carboxylic acids can be converted into esters via treatment with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. The term is further intended to include lower hydrocarbon groups capable of being solvated under physiological conditions, e.g., alkyl esters, methyl, ethyl and propyl esters.

Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.

Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for intravenous, oral, nasal, topical, transdermal, buccal, sublingual, rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent.

Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients.

Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents.

Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.

Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.

Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.

The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.

Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.

Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the active compound in a polymer matrix or gel.

Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Such solutions are useful for the treatment of the conditions described herein, such as NV, hemangiogenesis or angiogenesis of the corneal tissue.

Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.

Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.

The preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given by forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Intravenous injection administration is preferred.

The phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion.

The phrases “systemic administration,” “administered systematically,” “peripheral administration” and “administered peripherally” as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.

These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.

Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient.

The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.

A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.

In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, intravenous and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient, when used for the indicated analgesic effects, will range from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, more preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 mg per kg per day, and still more preferably from about 0.1 to about 40 mg per kg per day. For example, between about 0.01 microgram and 20 micrograms, between about 20 micrograms and 100 micrograms and between about 10 micrograms and 200 micrograms of the compounds of the invention are administered per 20 grams of subject weight.

If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include a “therapeutically effective amount” or a “prophylactically effective amount” of one or more of the lipoxins of the invention. A “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, e.g., a diminishment or prevention of effects associated with various disease states or conditions. A therapeutically effective amount of the lipoxin may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the therapeutic compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the therapeutic agent are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the lipoxin and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.

An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a lipoxin of the invention is 0.1-20 mg/kg, more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.

While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical composition.
