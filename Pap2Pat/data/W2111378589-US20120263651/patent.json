    "title": "Single Stranded DNA Aptamers Binding NF-kB/RelA",
    "date": "2012-04-12 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "DNA aptamers are high affinity ligands selected by genetic enrichment techniques to bind to specific protein targets. Because these represent chemically stable and reproducible molecules, they have application as affinity reagents and/or therapeutic drugs to affect the target protein's actions. NF-kB is an important mediator of the innate immune response and mediator of tissue inflammation. Although RNA and double stranded DNA aptamers have been identified to bind to the NF-kB family of proteins, the present invention represents the first identification of single stranded DNA aptamers that recognize NFkB RelA. The aptamers disclosed herein bind to several distinct regions of RelA and may be useful to antagonize the DNA binding of RelA as an inhibitor of cellular inflammation, visualize the location or amount of RelA in tissues from pathological conditions, or to quantitatively measure the activated state of RelA by affinity binding.",

The signal amplification strategy is established for the aptamer-based molecular recognition of a target protein with concomitant release of single-stranded DNA (G-DNA), which binds complimentarily to a single-stranded RNA comprising a fluorophore and a quencher (\u201cF-RNA-Q\u201d). The fluorescence-quenched RNA is then degraded by RNase H to result in a fluorescence signal, and the undamaged G-DNA is recycled to yield fluorescence amplification.",

These oligonucleotides or aptamer can specifically be bound to TNF-\u03b1 and inhibit the cytoxicity of TNF-\u03b1 to L929 cells. Therefore, the aptamer of the present invention may be used to detect TNF-\u03b1 and provide a therapeutic method for diseases related to the increasing level of TNF-\u03b1. Compared with other TNF antagonists such as monoclonal antibody and soluble receptor, the present invention has high specificity, high affinity, quick penetration to target tissue, rapid plasma clearance, and lower immunogenicity. Furthermore, it can be used repeatedly and keeps high concentration in target tissue and the like. It has the advantages of affinity and specificity similar to monoclonal antibodies and also has permeability and pharmacokinetics characteristics similar to small molecular polypeptide. The present invention also refers to derivative of the oligonucleotides sequence, including modified sequence. The present invention may further be manufactured as medicine for therapy and diagnosis of TNF-\u03b1 related diseases."

                        "The present invention describes the isolation of a ssDNA aptamer (termed P028F4) that binds to the activated (I\u03baB\u03b1-dissociated) form of RelA and its application in an enrichment-mass spectrometric quantification assay for activated RelA.",
                        "The ssDNA P028F4 competes with cognate duplex high affinity NF-\u03baB binding sites for RelA binding in vitro and also binds activated RelA in eukaryotic nuclei. P028F4 transfection into A549 cells reduces TNF\u03b1-stimulated endogenous NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression. Incorporation of P028F4 as an affinity isolation step after initial enrichment with FLAG mAb enriches for Ser 536 phosphorylated- and p300 coactivator complexed RelA, simultaneously depleting I\u03baB\u03b1\u00b7RelA complexes.",
                        "The present invention further described the development of a stable isotope dilution (SID)-SRM-MS assay for RelA that produced a linear response over 1,000 fold dilution range of input protein and had a 200 amol lower limit of quantification (S/N 85, 10.2% CV). This multiplex SID-SRM RelA assay was used to quantify activated endogenous RelA in cytokine-stimulated eukaryotic cells isolated by single-step P028F4 enrichment. The aptamer-SID-SRM-MS assay quantified the fraction of activated RelA in subcellular extract, detecting the presence of an inert cytoplasmic RelA reservoir unresponsive to TNF\u03b1 stimulation. Thus, the aptamer-SID-SRM-MS of the present invention is a versatile tool for quantification of activated NF-\u03baB/RelA and its associated complexes in response to pathway activation.",
                        "The innate immune response (IIR) is a stereotypic cellular response to alarmins, defensins and pathogen-associated molecular patterns that initiates inflammation, secretion of anti-microbial proteins and produces adaptive immunity (1,2). A major intracellular effector pathway of the IIR involves nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), a ubiquitous family of highly inducible cytoplasmic transcription factors that control the expression of genetic networks that both initiate mucosal inflammation and later terminate the IIR (3,4). Nuclear Factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a family of TNF\u03b1-inducible transcription factors regulated by stimulus-induced protein interactions. In the cytoplasm, the potent RelA transactivator is inactivated by binding inhibitory I\u03baBs, whereas in its activated state, the serine-phosphorylated protein binds the p300 histone acetyltransferase.",
                        "In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB/RelA transcriptional activator is inhibited by binding to the I\u03baB inhibitory proteins, resulting in cytoplasmic retention and inactivation of its DNA-binding activity (5). NF-\u03baB/RelA activation is mediated by ligand-bound cell surface cytokine- or pattern recognition receptors. Here, receptor-associated adapter proteins are modified by Lys 63-linked polyubiquitylation, a post-translational modification that is recognized by the ubiquitin binding domain of the IKK regulatory subunit (6), recruiting IKK into the submembranous complex (7,8). This molecular interaction produces serine (Ser) phosphorylation in the IKK activation loop (9). Subsequently IKK dissociates back into the cytoplasm where it phosphorylates the I\u03baB\u03b1 NH2 terminal regulatory domain on two adjacent Ser residues (10). Phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 is then selectively degraded within the complex (11,12).",
                        "Liberated from its I\u03baB\u03b1 inhibitor, RelA rapidly enters the nucleus. A parallel pathway, required for NF-\u03baB transactivation, produces RelA phosphorylation at Ser residue 536- or 276 (13-16). This event is required for binding the p300 coactivator, stimulating \u2212Lys 310 acetylation (17), a post-translational switch that enhances NF-\u03baB binding, forming a transcriptionally active enhanceosome, modifying histones of target gene promoters and inducing proteolytic clearance of promoter-bound RelA through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (13). In this way, subcellular localization, transcriptional activity and protein turnover of NF-\u03baB is controlled by coupled inducible posttranslational modifications that affect protein-protein interactions.",
                        "A significant technical advance in systematic discovery of protein interaction networks has been the development and refinement of the tandem affinity purification (TAP) technique (18). In this technique, an affinity epitope-tagged \u201cbait\u201d protein is expressed and bait-associated complexes are isolated under native conditions by sequential affinity isolation. Using TAP, the interactome of 32 major regulators of the NF-\u03baB pathway was determined, identifying over 680 non-redundant interacting proteins, representing 171 of 241 previously reported protein interactions (19). Bioinformatics filtering to eliminate nonspecific and high abundance contaminants reduced the interacting proteins to 131 \u201chigh confidence\u201d interactors (19).",
                        "Methods that selectively isolate activated NF-\u03baB/RelA complexes increase the understanding of the biochemistry of its transcriptional activation. To this end, selective enrichment of ssDNA oligonucleotides (\u201captamers\u201d) that selectively bind the activated state of target proteins may have an important role in understanding the abundance and interaction network of activated complexes. The present inventors report herein an aptamer that stably binds and selectively isolates the activated state of NF-\u03baB RelA. ssDNA aptamer P028F4 binds and associates with activated NF-\u03baB/RelA in eukaryotic nuclei, and inhibits its association with endogenous promoters within the chromatin environment. Incorporation of aptamer P028F4 as an affinity isolation step after enrichment with FLAG binding enriches for RelA in its Ser 536 phosphorylated and p300-complexed state, while depleting inactive I\u03baB\u03b1\u00b7RelA complexes. The inventors demonstrate that an aptamer enrichment technique coupled to absolute protein quantification using SID-SRM-MS can be used to quantify the fraction of activated RelA in cytokine-stimulated eukaryotic cells. This method is a versatile tool for quantification of activated NF-\u03baB/RelA and analysis of its associated complexes that will further extend systems approaches to understand the NF-\u03baB interactome.",

Although aptamer P028A1 did not disrupt the NF-\u03baB complex, aptamer P028F4 competed effectively for dsNF-\u03baB binding.",
                        "In a converse study, NE prepared from unstimulated or TNF\u03b1-stimulated A549 cells was directly bound to radiolabeled P028F4 as a probe in the presence of unlabeled specific or non-specific dsDNA competitor. In control NE, a complex of nonspecific proteins was detected on P028F4. Upon TNF\u03b1 stimulation, two new nucleoprotein complexes were detected that represent specific NFkB complexes because they competed specifically with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled dsNF-\u03baB wild type (WT), but not mutant (Mut) DNA sequences (FIG. 2B). Together, these data indicated that aptamer P028F4 competes for dsNF-\u03baB binding to NF-\u03baB/RelA.",
                        "Aptamer P028F4 colocalizes with activated nuclear RelA: Other studies have shown that aptamers are bound nonspecifically to high abundance ssRNA binding proteins in cells (29); the present inventors also found that transfection of intact cells with chemically synthesized fluorescent TEX 615-conjugated P028A1 and P028F4 showed a high amount of nonspecific cytoplasmic staining, despite methods to reduce nonspecific interactions such as zwitterionic detergents [not shown, ref (29)]. To circumvent this problem, the inventors imaged intact nuclei from control or TNF\u03b1 stimulated EGFP-RelA expressing A549 cells stained with TEX 615-conjugated P028A1 or P028F4 by confocal microscopy. In the absence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation, little EGFP staining was detected (FIG. 3A). By contrast, upon TNF\u03b1 stimulation, the nuclei were strongly stained with translocated EGFP-RelA. Nuclei treated with P028A1 were TEX 615-negative in the absence or presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (FIG. 3A). By contrast, TNF\u03b1 stimulated nuclei treated with P028F4 strongly stained TEX 615-positive, whereas control nuclei were negative (FIG. 3B). The merged images indicated colocalization.

To determine whether P028F4 interfered with TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression, A549 cells were reverse transfected with nothing, P028A1 or P028F4 (4 \u03bcM respectively) and the cells were TNF\u03b1 stimulated. Relative changes in Gro\u03b2 and TNFAIP3/A20 transcripts were determined by Q-RT-PCR. In the absence of aptamer transfection, Gro\u03b2 mRNA was induced 5-fold in response to TNF\u03b1 (FIG. 4A, top). In cells transfected with P028A1, an inconsistent effect on unstimulated Gro\u03b2 expression was observed, but this did not significantly reduce the Gro\u03b2 expression induced by TNF\u03b1. By contrast, in P028F4-transfected cells, basal and TNF\u03b1-induced Gro\u03b2 expression was significantly reduced to less than 2-fold induction. Similar qualitative results were observed for the expression of TNFAIP3/A20, where the nearly 7-fold induction observed in control transfected cells was reduced to less than 2-fold in P028F4-transfected cells (FIG. 4A, bottom). Importantly, each RNA sample was measured for expression of GAPDH as an internal control, where aptamer transfection had no effect on GAPDH mRNA levels. These observations indicated that transfected P028F4 had a consistent inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression in vivo.",
                        "Aptamer P028F4 blocks RelA association with endogenous NF-\u03baB dependent gene promoters in vivo: Previous studies using dynamic live-cell imaging have shown that RelA association with endogenous chromatin is hyperdynamic (40), in contrast to its stable association with DNA targets in vitro. This observation makes the ability of P028F4 to compete for RelA binding seen earlier in EMSA (FIG. 2) of uncertain relevance to the interaction of RelA with endogenous chromatin. To address this issue, aptamer-transfected A549 cells stimulated in the absence or presence of TNF\u03b1 were subjected to two-step ChIP assay for Gro\u03b2 or TNFAIP3/A20 (39). Here, specific RelA binding was observed in unstimulated cells (compare RelA immunoprecipitate to IgG control), and relative RelA binding to Gro-\u03b2 increased to 3.5-fold in response to TNF\u03b1. A weak nonspecific reduction of TNF\u03b1-induced RelA was observed in response to P028A1, whereas a greater, significant inhibitory effect of P028F4 was observed in response to TNF\u03b1 (FIG. 4B, top). Similar results were observed for the TNFAIP/3A20 promoter, where the 3.5-fold increase in RelA binding was reduced to less than 2-fold (FIG. 4B, bottom). Together these data indicated that P028F4 competes for RelA binding to its endogenous chromatin binding sites, explaining its inhibitory activity.",

To determine if P028F4 recognizes free RelA or that complexed to I\u03baB\u03b1, purified recombinant GST-RelA (1-313) was pre-incubated in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of recombinant full length GST-I\u03baB\u03b1. Complex formation was determined by nondenaturing coimmunoprecipitation assay using anti-RelA Ab. In this study, RelA was immunoprecipitated under native conditions, and associated I\u03baB\u03b1 detected by Western immunoblot (FIG. 5A). I\u03baB\u03b1 staining in the immunoprecipitated material indicated RelA association with I\u03baB\u03b1. The same free RelA and RelA\u00b7\u03baB\u03b1 complex mixtures were then separately mixed with radiolabeled P028F4 for binding assay in EMSA. Although P028F4 bound to free RelA, no binding was observed for the RelA\u00b7I\u03baB\u03b1 complexes (FIG. 5B). Together, these data indicated P028F4 recognized RelA only in its activated (non I\u03baB\u03b1-complexed) form.",

For this purpose, CE or NE from control- or TNF\u03b1-stimulated A549 cells were bound to Bt-P028A1 or Bt-P028F4. After capture on SA-magnetic beads and washing, the presence of RelA was measured by Western immunoblot. In CE, it was observed that P028F4 only captured RelA prepared from TNF\u03b1-stimulated cells, whereas P028A1 did not (FIG. 6A). Although P028A1 captured nuclear RelA in TNF\u03b1 stimulated cells, Bt-P028F4 captured significantly more activated RelA. In both CE and NE, aberrantly migrating forms of RelA were also captured by P028F4, suggesting that the P028F4 enriches for post-translationally modified RelA isoforms (indicated by *, FIG. 6A). These complexes are highly suggestive of inducible RelA-ubiquitin polymers shown previously to migrate at \u02dc150 kDa (41).",

Western immunoblot staining with anti-phospho-Ser 536 RelA Ab shows the presence of Ser 536-phosphorylated EGFP-RelA and endogenous phospho-Ser 536 RelA in the P028F4 eluates (FIG. 6B). The abundance of p300 was below the limit of detection in the FLAG eluates, but was strongly detected in the P028F4 eluate (FIG. 6B). Finally, the inventors also monitored for I\u03baB\u03b1 association. Although I\u03baB\u03b1 was present in the starting material, I\u03baB\u03b1 was found only in the flow-through fraction (FIG. 6B, bottom panel).

First, the SRM-MS assays were optimized by selecting high responding Q1/Q3 transitions, and specificity established.",
                        "Selection and optimization of SRM Q1/Q3 transitions: Because the intensities of individual fragments derived from one precursor ion differ substantially, selection of the most intense fragments for each signature peptide is essential for developing a high-sensitivity SRM assay. In this study, four or five y-ions were selected for each peptide. The y-ions were preferred over b-ions because b-ions were usually less prominent or absent in the QQQ-MS instrument MS-MS spectra; only the y-ions whose m/z values exceed precursor ion m/z were chosen. The selection of fragment ions were on the basis of MS-MS spectra of the peptide from previous LC-MS-MS and SRM-triggered MS-MS experiments, the highest intensity fragment ions in MS-MS were selected to maximize the sensitivity of detection. The sensitivity of the SRM assays for each target peptide was further increased by optimizing collision energy. As shown in FIG. 7, the SIS RelA peptide, TPPYADPSLQAPVR (SEQ ID NO: 6) was nanoinfused into the TSQ mass spectrometer, and the optimal collision energy for each transition obtained by performing a breakdown curve. Compared to the CE voltage predicted by the generic formula CE=0.034\u00d7(precursor ion m/z)+3.314, the optimized CE voltage yields slightly better results. The inventors empirically optimized the S-lens voltage for each signature peptide. The difference between the values in S-lens table generated during MS calibration and empirically derived S-lens value was found to be an average gain of less than 5% of total peak area. Therefore, in this study, we used the values in S-lens table generated during MS calibration for all the experiments. The selected Q1/Q3 transitions and their CE are tabulated in Table 1.",
                        "Specificity of SRM Quantification: Shared precursor-product ion transitions with those from other analytes can lead to false positives in the subsequent peak assignment and quantification inaccuracy. With the use of SIS peptides as internal standards, we used four analyte-specific criteria-precursor ion m/z, product ion m/z, chromatographic retention time and the relative product ion intensities, for identifying chromatographic peaks that correspond to the authentic analyte peptide. Analyte peptides and their SIS analogs have identical chromatographic retention time because of their physiochemical similarities. Under the same collision energy and collision-activated dissociation pressure, the analyte and the SIS peptide dissociate to generate the same pattern of product ions, which differ only by y m/z (reflecting addition of the stable isotope-labeled amino acids) and absolute intensity. Importantly, the relative intensities of the complement of product ions formed by each analyte peptide and its SIS analog are nearly identical. These features were used for evaluating the selectivity of SRM assays and the certainty of peak assignment. For this purpose, the present inventors chose 4-5 SRM pairs for each peptide, and manually examined the MS raw data to ensure that the analyte peptides and their SIS analogs had same chromatographic retention time (variance below 0.05 min) and relative product ion intensities (\u00b120% variance in the relative ratios for each fragment). This inspection ensured that selected SRM ion pairs of both analyte peptides and SIS peptides were free of matrix interference from co-eluting ions. As shown in FIG. 8, RelA natural peptides had nearly identical chromatographic retention time and relative product ion intensities as their SIS analogs, indicating that the SRM assays had high specificity. We believe that the high specificity of the assay was achieved, in part, because the aptamer enrichment significantly reduces the sample complexity and our application of h-SRM mode for data acquisition. Therefore, for quantification of each peptide, we used the sum of the signals from all monitored transitions instead of selecting a single representative SRM ion pair for each peptide.",
                        "Linear Response and limit of SRM Quantification of RelA: The assay dynamic range, representing the concentration range between the lower to upper limits of quantification (LLOQ to ULOQ), is the range where protein concentration is measurable with acceptable levels of accuracy and precision. The assay dynamic range was assessed by the method of standard addition (42-44). In this method, serial dilutions of target proteins with a fixed amount of SIS peptide are spiked into the similar matrix to the neat specimen, and a response calibration curve is generated for each [12C]-analyte peptide. However, because a blank sample matrix devoid of activated endogenous RelA and a purified form of activated endogenous RelA protein are not available, we alternatively used a [12C]-analyte peptide of RelA with its native flanking sequences (VFR-TPPYADPSLQAPVR-VSM) (SEQ ID NO: 19), to characterize the assay dynamic range. The [12C]-analyte peptide was digested with trypsin in the same matrix as used for the \u201con-beads\u201d digestion of aptamer-enriched RelA. We diluted the tryptic digest to generate a range of analyte concentrations spanning a 10,000-fold concentration range (from 200 amol to 20 pmol on the column). These analyte concentrations were then combined with a constant amount of [13C]-analyte peptide internal standard. Two replicate LC-SRM-MS analyses of each sample dilution were performed in the order from the most dilute to the most concentrated. Linear regression analysis was performed on the observed peak area ratios (natural:heavy) vs concentration ratios to generate calibration curves (FIG. 9). The SRM assay yields linear responses over a >1,000-fold concentration range with a strong linear correlations (r>0.9971). When the amount of RelA peptide loaded on the column was higher than 10 pmol or lower than 500 amol, the response became nonlinear. The non-linearity on the high concentration is due to the saturation of both the MS detector and the nano HPLC column, whereas the non-linearity on the low concentration end is mainly because of matrix interference and the trace amount of [12C]-analyte peptide of RelA contaminating the [13C]-analyte peptide internal standard.",
                        "The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of SRM assay, the lowest analyte quantity that can be accurately measured, is the measurement of the sensitivity of the assay. The LLOQ of the SRM assay can be defined as the lowest analyte concentration that can be measured with <20% CV (45,46). In the present study, the lowest natural RelA peptide can be quantified is 200 amol (S/N 85, 10.2% CV), a value representing the LLOQ of the RelA SRM assay.",

To determine its effect on S/N, the inventors measured S/N for endogenous RelA in crude and P028F4-enriched samples. It was found that the S/N ratio of endogenous RelA is only 12 when analyzed directly from crude CE (FIG. 10), whereas P028F4 enrichment resulted in 36-fold increase in S/N ratio (from 12 to 429, FIG. 10).",

Control or TNF\u03b1-stimulated A549 cells were fractionated into CE or NE fractions, incubated with Bt-P028F4 or P028A1 aptamers, and captured on SA-magnetic beads. To first determine whether the aptamer capture on SA-magnetic beads was non-saturating, RelA from increasing numbers of control- or TNF\u03b1-stimulated A549 cells were subjected to single-step aptamer enrichment, and detected by Western immunoblot. As seen in FIGS. 12A and 12B, increasing amounts of RelA were seen over the input range of 3-12\u00d7106 cells only in the TNF-stimulated extracts.",
                        "To quantify the amount of RelA in cells, CE and NE from 6\u00d7106 cells were prepared and assayed for cytoplasmic and nuclear markers. As seen in FIG. 13A, CE were highly enriched in \u03b2-tubulin, whereas \u03b2-tubulin was undetectable in NE. Similarly, histone H3 was undetectable in CE and highly enriched in NE. The active RelA in CE and NE were then captured by Bt-aptamer-SA magnetic beads. The proteins were trypsinized on-beads, and RelA and I\u03baB\u03b1 were quantified with SID-SRM-MS. To determine the fraction of activated RelA complex, total RelA in each subcellular extract was also quantified with SID-SRM-MS. As shown in FIG. 13B, P028F4 demonstrated high specificity toward activated RelA in comparison to P028A1, resulting in 14-30 fold enrichment of activated RelA in CE and NE. With the quantification of SID-SRM-MS, the inventors found that, in unstimulated cells, about 5% of total RelA proteins in the cytoplasm were activated, and only a small amount of activated (and total) RelA was in the nucleus. By contrast, after TNF\u03b1 stimulation, the amount of activated RelA in CE increased about 6-fold. The inventors also observed a significant amount of activated RelA translocated into the nucleus, where the amount of activated RelA was the same as the total amount of nuclear RelA. Although it was measured, I\u03baB\u03b1 was not observed in any of the aptamer-enriched samples, a finding that is consistent with the lack of RelA-I\u03baB\u03b1 complex binding seen in Western blot analysis (FIG. 6B), and in EMSA (FIG. 5).",

                        "Mucosal inflammation produced by the innate immune response is dependent on the NF-\u03baB pathway, an intracellular signaling network whose activity is regulated by the formation of dynamic protein interactions. Activated pattern recognition- or cytokine receptors binding to their cognate ligands induce Lys 63 linked polyuquitiylation of the RIP and TRAF adapter molecules (6). These polyubiquityl-modified adapters recruit IKK to the submembranous receptor complex, producing serine phosphorylation and activation of IKK, an event that controls protein stability of I\u03baB\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of activated RelA. In the nucleus, RelA associates with the p300 histone acetyltransferase, whose promoter recruitment activates expression of downstream inflammatory genetic networks. As a result of direct activation of negative feedback networks including I\u03baB\u03b1 synthesis, RelA undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic oscillation in response to activation (47). In this study, the inventors describe the selection and characterization of a RelA-directed ssDNA oligonucleotide, P028F4, a ligand that directly binds recombinant RelA in vitro, and binds inducible RelA in isolated NEs. P028F4 enriches for serine phosphorylated and p300-complexed RelA. The inventors provide evidence that P028F4 has utility as a method for single step enrichment and quantification of activated RelA complexes using quantitative SID-SRM-MS assays. This method has, for the first time, allowed the determination of the fraction of activated RelA in unstimulated cells and the estimation of activated RelA molecules.",
                        "Competition studies on the aptamers described in Table 3 showed that the aptamers in Group I competed for RelA binding with each other. Aptamers in Group II do not compete with Group I aptamers. Bolding indicates the binding specific variable regions of the aptamers. The flanking sequences are the PCR primer binding sites required for amplification of the aptamers. Genetic selection of protein-binding aptamers is a widely exploited method for probing protein function and structure (20,21). Previous efforts isolating RelA ligands have resulted in isolation of ssRNA aptamers and ds-thioate- and dithioate modified ligands that bind NF-\u03baB/RelA (48,49). To our knowledge, this work represents the first report of isolation of a ssDNA aptamer that specifically recognizes NF-\u03baB/RelA. Our data show that P028F4 binds with a KD of 6.4\u00d710\u221210 M, representing about 10-fold higher affinity than that of the reported ssRNA aptamers (48). Moreover, this binding is more stable than that described for duplex DNA binding to RelA. Although previous work showing that thioate modified duplex aptamers can recognize specific NF-\u03baB isoforms, their on and off-rates have not been reported (49). One property of P028F4 is that this ligand binds with a long off-rate, measured by SPR with a kd of 0.0018 l/s. This characteristic lends itself well to its application for affinity isolations of the target protein and its complexes.",
                        "The crystallographic structure of the RelA-complexed to its duplex binding sites shows that RelA binds as a dimer, assuming an immunoglobulin fold structure with \u03b2-stranded loops making extensive contract with both DNA base pairs and the sugar-phosphate backbone (50). The binding characterization described herein shows that ssDNA P028F4 competes with RelA for its cognate dsDNA regulatory sequences. These data may suggest that P028F4 binds RelA on a \u03b2-stranded loop that is essential for stable DNA binding, or alternatively, P028F4 may induce RelA to assume a conformational change nonpermissive for DNA interaction. In this regard, it is to be noted that a high affinity ssRNA aptamer that selectively binds NF-\u03baB p50 isoform also competes with duplex DNA binding by inducing an alternative molecular conformation of the protein (51).",
                        "Because P028F4 is a competitive antagonist of activated RelA DNA binding activity, the inventors explored its properties as antagonist of RelA transcriptional activity in intact cells. Although we observed that cellular transfection of P028F4 produced additional inhibition of expression of NF-\u03baB dependent target genes over that of the control P028A1 aptamer, the studies herein also indicate that at the concentrations needed to overcome nonspecific cellular binding (29), there is a non-specific aptamer effect on TNF\u03b1-inducible transcription (FIG. 4A). In the ChIP studies, an even stronger non-specific aptamer effect was also seen (FIG. 4B). We ascribe these nonspecific P028A1 effects as being due to well-recognized low affinity interactions of cellular transcription factors for nonspecific DNA, and is consistent with its weak abilities to compete for RelA binding in nitrocellulose filter binding assays (Table 2), and capture RelA in aptamer-affinity binding studies (FIG. 6A). This nonspecific effect will need to be reduced before ssDNA aptamers like P028F4 can be used to modify RelA action in intact cells.",
                        "An important feature of P028F4-RelA interaction, exploited in this study, is that I\u03baB\u03b1-complexed RelA is not recognized by P028F4. The inventors base this conclusion on the inability of P028F4 to bind to purified recombinant I\u03baB\u03b1-complexed RelA (FIG. 5), its colocalization with activated EGFP-RelA in isolated nuclei (FIG. 3A), its binding to post-translationally modified RelA in cellular extracts (FIG. 6B), and its binding enrichment of RelA (over that of I\u03baB\u03b1) in affinity isolations measured by quantitative SRM-MS assays. Previous work has shown that I\u03baB\u03b1 binds the NH2 terminus of RelA with a 1:1 stoichiometry on discontinuous sequences through its 7 ankryin repeat domains. X-Ray crystallographic analysis of the I\u03baB\u03b1\u00b7RelA complex shows that first two ankryrin repeats bind (and mask) the RelA nuclear localization signal, and the sixth repeat occludes the RelA DNA-binding cleft (52). Through these interactions, I\u03baB\u03b1 is able to both inhibit RelA nuclear translocation as well as its DNA binding activity.",
                        "Although DNA aptamers have been used as affinity reagents for identifying biomarkers in complex fluids (53), they have not yet been fully exploited in protein quantification. The approach demonstrated herein combines aptamer-enrichment of RelA and SRM-MS quantification using stable isotopic dilution methods. Compared to direct quantification of RelA and associated proteins from crude cell extracts, aptamer-based enrichment approach has several advantages. First, using a RelA-specific aptamer to enrich RelA and its associated proteins prior to SRM-MS analysis dramatically reduces the sample complexity and hence improves the S/N ratio of endogenous RelA 36-fold. Second, aptamer enrichment also reduces the likelyhood of the interference of other analytes, which have isobaric (or very similar m/z values) to the target peptides. Therefore the specificity and accuracy of SRM assay are significantly improved. Third, aptamer enrichment allows RelA to be isolated from a large amount of protein extract so that the amount of endogenous RelA peptide falls in the middle of linear dynamic range of the calibration curve, which improves the accuracy and reproducibility of quantification. This feature is especially attractive for quantification of low-abundance proteins, such as RelA or p300 transcription factors, in complex protein mixtures. Finally, because P028F4 selectively recognizes the I\u03baB\u03b1-free, activated form of RelA, we are able to quantify the abundance of the activated form of RelA. This measurement cannot be accomplished by directly analyzing RelA abundance in crude cellular (or subcellular) extracts.",
                        "Described earlier, RelA is a cytoplasmic transcription factor that undergoes constitutive nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. In the unstimulated cell, RelA is sequestered in the cytoplasm predominately by binding the I\u03baB\u03b1 inhibitor, an association that masks the nuclear localization sequence, shifting the nuclear-cytoplasmic equilibrium of RelA to the cytoplasmic compartment. Stimulus-induced RelA activation is mediated by I\u03baB\u03b1 proteolysis, liberating a fraction of sequestered RelA to translocate into the nucleus, shifting the equilibrium to the nuclear compartment. The theoretical understanding of NF-\u03baB regulation has been developed using computational modeling approaches, where the relative contributions of the I\u03baB isoforms and the effect of the negative feedback loops have been inferred (54,55). Despite this understanding of pathway connections, the dynamics of negative feedback loops are dependent on the fraction of activated RelA that enters the nucleus. This value is based on assumed values because the precise concentration of activated RelA has not yet been experimentally determined.",
                        "The present invention represents the first quantitative estimate of the number of activated RelA molecules. In a recent study, using single-cell dynamic imaging and quantitative Western blot measurements, the inventors observed that only a small fraction of total cytoplasmic RelA is induced to translocate into the nucleus, introducing the concept of an inert, cytoplasmic RelA reservoir (56). When parameters describing the RelA cytoplasmic reservoir are incorporated into the deterministic model, Bayesian inference estimation for the number of RelA molecules that translocate approximates 10-20% of the total cytoplasmic amount. Using this correction, the ability of the model to predict biologically relevant behavior improved significantly (56). However, the exact component of activated RelA has only been assumed in these models.",
                        "The aptamer-SID-SRM estimation of 200,000 total molecules of RelA/cell with 50,000 molecules/cell of activated RelA in the nucleus after TNF\u03b1 stimulation are in good agreement with our previous quantitative Western blot studies (56). It is also to be noted that the amount of activated RelA is equivalent with the amount of total RelA in both control and TNF\u03b1 stimulated NE. The findings described herein indicate that the majority of RelA present in the NE is in the activated state, consistent with the previous findings by the present inventors using Western immunoblots that the amount of nuclear I\u03baB\u03b1 is very low. The estimate the present inventors make here for the number of activated RelA molecules in CE has not yet been possible without the development of P028F4, and its ability to discriminate between the bound\u2014and free RelA fractions. It is interesting to note that the number of copies of activated RelA in CE and NE in stimulated cells are similar\u2014a finding that may have implications in understanding the energetics controlling nuclear RelA import",
                        "The NF-\u03baB/RelA aptamers of the present invention can be utilized for imaging the anatomical sites or extent of inflammation in a number of disease states. The, NF-\u03baB/RelA aptamers described herein can be synthesized as synthetic conjugates to contrast agents that will localize to specific sites of inflammation. Imaging modalities can include ultrasound (US), or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. For example, NF-\u03baB/RelA aptamers can be conjugated to microbubbles; injection of NF-\u03baB/RelA-microbubbles will allow the detection of the site or amount of inflammation in the cardiovascular system by high resolution ultrasonography. Similarly conjugation of NFkB/RelA aptamers to gadolinium-DTPA producing a paramagnetic liposome. Intravenous injection of the conjugate will result in localization and allow the detection of inflammation by MR imaging.",
                        "Imaging using NF-\u03baB/RelA conjugated to contrast agents can be used to assess the presence, location, or extent of inflammation in human inflammatory diseases. These diseases would include asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis and aortic dissections) and specific cancers (prostate, melanoma) diseases whose etiology and progression are known to be mediated by NF-\u03baB/RelA signaling (57-65). Quantification of the presence, location, or extent of inflammation in human inflammatory diseases can be used as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of the drug, or assess the individual response to the therapy. Some non-limiting agents to which the aptamers of the present invention can be conjugates include radionuclides (technetium, indium, fluorine, iodine, bromine isotopes conjugated to targeting aptamers), gold (gold as a contrast agent for aptamers), magnetic nanoparticles (paramagnetic bead-aptamer conjugate used for MRI), fluorescent (Cy5 labeled aptamers used for whole-body imaging in mice), quantum dots (aptamer-quantum dot-doxorubicin conjugate for combined imaging and therapy), and gadolinium (gadolinium for imaging includes liposomes and microbubbles).",

These formulations could involve encapsulation in nanoparticles to enhance cellular uptake, and conjugation of the aptamer to anti-proliferative agents. In addition effector molecules can also be attached to the aptamers for therapeutic purposes. Non-limiting examples of the effector molecules include toxins (RNA aptamer:gelonin conjugates to kill prostate cancer cells), radionuclides (Technetium 99m conjugated aptamers to target tenascin C expressing tumor cells), nanoparticles (nanoparticle encapsulated drugs), chemotherapeutic agents (aptamers conjugated to doxorubicin, daunorubicin, cisplatin), photodynamic agents (aptamers conjugated to the photosensitizing agent chlorine e6), and gold (aptamer-gold nanoparticle-doxorubicin bioconjugate for CT imaging and scanning)",
