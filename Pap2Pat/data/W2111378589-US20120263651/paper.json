    "abstract": "Nuclear Factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a family of inducible transcription factors regulated by stimulus-induced protein interactions. In the cytoplasm, the NF-\u03baB member RelA transactivator is inactivated by binding inhibitory I\u03baBs, whereas in its activated state, the serine-phosphorylated protein binds the p300 histone acetyltransferase. Here we describe the isolation of a ssDNA aptamer (termed P028F4) that binds to the activated (I\u03baB\u03b1-dissociated) form of RelA with a K(D) of 6.4 \u00d7 10(-10), and its application in an enrichment-mass spectrometric quantification assay. ssDNA P028F4 competes with cognate duplex high affinity NF-\u03baB binding sites for RelA binding in vitro, binds activated RelA in eukaryotic nuclei and reduces TNF\u03b1-stimulated endogenous NF-\u03baB dependent gene expression. Incorporation of P028F4 as an affinity isolation step enriches for serine 536 phosphorylated and p300 coactivator complexed RelA, simultaneously depleting I\u03baB\u03b1\u00b7RelA complexes. A stable isotope dilution (SID)-selected reaction monitoring (SRM)- mass spectrometry (MS) assay for RelA was developed that produced a linear response over 1,000 fold dilution range of input protein and had a 200 amol lower limit of quantification. This multiplex SID-SRM-MS RelA assay was used to quantify activated endogenous RelA in cytokine-stimulated eukaryotic cells isolated by single-step P028F4 enrichment. The aptamer-SID-SRM-MS assay quantified the fraction of activated RelA in subcellular extracts, detecting the presence of a cytoplasmic RelA reservoir unresponsive to TNF\u03b1 stimulation. We conclude that aptamer-SID-SRM-MS is a versatile tool for quantification of activated NF-\u03baB/RelA and its associated complexes in response to pathway activation.",

In the absence of TNF\u2423 stimulation, little EGFP-RelA staining was detected (Fig. 3A). By contrast, upon TNF\u2423 stimulation, the nuclei were strongly stained with translocated EGFP-RelA. Nuclei treated with P028A1 were TEX 615-negative in the absence or presence of TNF\u2423 stimulation (Fig. 3A). By contrast, TNF\u2423 stimulated nuclei treated with P028F4 strongly stained TEX 615-positive, whereas control nuclei were negative (Fig. 3B). The intense yellow staining of the merged images indicated colocalization of the aptamer and EGFP-RelA (Fig. 3B).

To determine whether P028F4 interfered with TNF\u2423-induced NF-B dependent gene expression, A549 cells were transfected with nothing, P028A1, or P028F4 (4 M respectively) and the cells were TNF\u2423 stimulated. Relative changes in Gro\u2424 and TNFAIP3/A20 transcripts were determined by Q-RT-PCR. In the absence of aptamer transfection, Gro\u2424 mRNA was induced fivefold in response to TNF\u2423 (Fig. 4A,top). In cells transfected with P028A1, we observed an inconsistent effect on unstimulated Gro\u2424 expression, but did not significantly reduce the Gro\u2424 expression induced by TNF\u2423. By contrast, in P028F4-transfected cells, basal and TNF\u2423-induced Gro\u2424 expression were significantly reduced to less than twofold induction. Similar qualitative results were observed for the expression of TNFAIP3/A20, where the nearly sevenfold induction observed in control transfected cells was reduced to less than twofold in P028F4-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, bottom). Importantly, each RNA sample was measured for expression of GAPDH as an internal control, where aptamer transfection had no effect on GAPDH mRNA levels. These observations indicated that transfected P028F4 had a consistent inhibitory effect on NF-B dependent gene expression in vivo.",

This observation makes the ability of P028F4 to compete for RelA binding seen earlier in EMSA (Fig. 2) of uncertain relevance to the interaction of RelA with endogenous chromatin. To address this issue, aptamer-transfected A549 cells stimulated in the absence or presence of TNF\u2423 were subjected to two-step ChIP assay for TNFAIP3/A20 (38). Here, specific RelA binding was observed in unstimulated cells (compare RelA immunoprecipitate to IgG control), and relative RelA binding to Gro-\u2424 increased to 3.5-fold in response to TNF\u2423. A weak nonspecific reduction of TNF\u2423-induced RelA was observed in response to P028A1, whereas a greater, significant inhibitory effect of P028F4 was observed in response to TNF\u2423 (Fig. 4B, top). Similar results were observed for the Gro\u2424 promoter, where the 3.5-fold increase in RelA binding was reduced to less than twofold (Fig. 4B,bottom).

To determine if P028F4 recognizes free RelA or that complexed to IB\u2423, purified recombinant GST-RelA (1-313) was pre-incubated in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of recombinant full length GST-IB\u2423. Complex formation was determined by nondenaturing coimmunoprecipitation assay using anti-RelA Ab.

The same free RelA and RelA\u2150IB\u2423 complex mixtures were then separately mixed with radiolabeled P028F4 for binding assay in EMSA. Although P028F4 bound to free RelA, no binding was observed for the RelA\u2150IB\u2423 complexes (Fig. 5B).

For this purpose, CE or NE from control-or TNF\u2423-stimulated A549 cells were bound to Bt-P028A1 or Bt-P028F4. After capture on SA-magnetic beads and washing, the presence of RelA was measured by Western immunoblot. In CE, we observed that P028F4 only captured RelA prepared from TNF\u2423-stimulated cells, whereas P028A1 did not (Fig. 6A). Although P028A1 captured nuclear RelA in TNF\u2423 stimulated cells, Bt-P028F4 captured significantly more activated RelA. In both CE and NE, aberrantly migrating forms of RelA were also captured by P028F4, suggesting that the P028F4 enriches for post-translationally modified RelA isoforms (indicated by * ; Fig. 6A). These complexes are highly suggestive of inducible RelA-ubiquitin polymers shown previously to migrate at \u03f3150 kDa (40). We next specifically assayed whether P028F4-captured RelA was in an activated state by measurement of activating Ser 536 phosphorylation and p300 complex formation. For this purpose, a two-step affinity isolation was performed, initially purifying EGFP-RelA using FLAG-M2 affinity beads, followed by Bt-P028F4 enrichment on SA-Magnetic Beads. Western immunoblot staining with anti-phospho-Ser 536 RelA Ab shows the presence of Ser 536-phosphorylated EGFP-RelA and endogenous phospho-Ser 536 RelA in the P028F4 eluates (Fig. 6B). The abundance of p300 was below the limit of detection in the FLAG eluates, but was strongly detected in the P028F4 eluate (Fig. 6B). Finally, we also monitored for IB\u2423 association. Although IB\u2423 was present in the starting material, IB\u2423 was found only in the flow-through fraction 6B, bottom panel). These data indicate that the ATAP technique enriches for a subset of RelA complexes containing activating RelA Ser phosphorylation, and p300 complexes but not those containing inactive RelA\u2150 IB\u2423 complexes.",

                        "Selection and Optimization of SRM Q1/Q3 Transitions-Because the intensities of individual fragments derived from one precursor ion differ substantially, selection of the most intense fragments for each signature peptide is essential for developing a high-sensitivity SRM assay. In this study, four or five y-ions of the highest intensity observed in previous LC-MS-MS and SRM-triggered MS-MS experiments, and whose mass to charge ratio (m/z) values exceed precursor ion m/z were selected for each peptide. The sensitivity of the SRM assays for each target peptide was further increased by optimizing the collision energy voltage. As shown in Fig. 7, the SIS RelA peptide, TPPYADPSLQAPVR was infused into the TSQ mass spectrometer, and the optimal collision energy for each transition obtained by performing a breakdown curve. Compared with predicted collision energy voltage (given by 0.034 \u03eb (precursor ion m/z) \u03e9 3.314), the experimentally optimized collision energy voltage yielded slightly better results. We further empirically optimized the S-lens voltage for each signature peptide. The difference between the values in S-lens table generated during MS calibration and empirically derived S-lens value was found to be an average gain of less than 5% of total peak area. Therefore, in this study, we used the values in S-lens table generated during MS calibration for all the experiments. The selected Q1/Q3 transitions and their collision energy voltages are tabulated in Table I.",
                        "Specificity of SRM Quantification-Shared precursor-product ion transitions with those from other analytes can lead to false positives in the subsequent peak assignment and quantification inaccuracy. With the use of SIS peptides as internal standards, we used four analyte-specific criteria for identify-ing chromatographic peaks that correspond to the authentic analyte peptide O precursor ion m/z, product ion m/z, chromatographic retention time, and the relative product ion intensities. Analyte peptides and their SIS analogs have identical chromatographic retention time because of their physiochemical similarities. Under the same collision energy and collision-activated dissociation pressure, the analyte and the SIS peptide dissociate to generate the same pattern of product ions, which differ only by the mass difference produced by the incorporation of the stable isotope-labeled amino acids and the difference in their absolute intensity. Importantly, the relative intensities of the complement of product ions formed by each analyte peptide and its SIS analog are nearly identical. These features were used for evaluating the selectivity of SRM assays and the certainty of peak assignment. For this purpose, we chose four to five SRM pairs for each peptide, and manually examined the MS raw data to ensure that the analyte peptides and their SIS analogs had same chromatographic retention time (variance below 0.05 min) and relative product ion intensities (\u03ee20% variance in the relative ratios for each fragment). This inspection ensured that selected SRM ion pairs of both analyte peptides and SIS peptides were free of matrix interference from co-eluting ions. As shown in Fig. 8, RelA natural peptides had nearly identical chromatographic retention time and relative product ion intensities as their SIS analogs, indicating that the SRM assays had high specificity. We believe that the high specificity of the assay was achieved, in part, because the aptamer enrichment significantly reduces the sample complexity and our application of high resolution-SRM mode for data acquisition. Therefore, for quantification of each peptide, we used the sum of the signals from all monitored transitions instead of selecting a single representative SRM ion pair for each peptide. FIG. 7. Optimization of collision energy of precursor-product ion transitions of RelA signature peptide. A solution of SIS peptide of RelA, TPPYADPSLQAPVR, was nanoinfused onto a TSQ mass spectrometer, and the optimal collision energy for each transition were obtained by performing a breakdown curve. The vertical dashed lines represent the calculated collision energy voltage using a generic formula (\u03ed 0.034 \u03eb (precursor ion m/z) \u03e9 3.314).

                "The assay dynamic range represents the concentration range where protein abundance is measurable with acceptable levels of accuracy and precision. The assay dynamic range was assessed by the method of standard addition (41)(42)(43). In this method, serial dilutions of target proteins with a fixed amount of SIS peptide are spiked into the similar cellular protein matrix, and a calibration curve is generated for target peptide. However, because a blank cellular protein matrix devoid of activated endogenous RelA was not available, we alternatively used a [ 12 C]-analyte peptide of RelA with its native flanking sequences (VFR-TPPYADPSLQAPVR-VSM), to characterize the assay dynamic range. The [ 12 C]-analyte peptide was digested with trypsin in the same matrix as used for the \"onbeads\" digestion of aptamer-enriched RelA. We diluted the tryptic digest to generate a range of analyte concentrations spanning a 10,000-fold concentration range (from 200 amol to 20 pmol on the column). These analyte concentrations were then combined with a constant amount of [ 13 C]-analyte peptide internal standard. Two replicate LC-SRM-MS analyses of each sample dilution were performed in the order from the most dilute to the most concentrated. Linear regression analysis was performed on the observed peak area ratios (natural: heavy) versus concentration ratios to generate calibration curves (Fig. 9). The SRM assay yields linear responses over a \u03fe1000-fold concentration range (r \u03fe 0.9971). When the amount of RelA peptide loaded on the column was higher than 10 pmol or lower than 500 amol, the response became nonlinear (Fig. 9). The nonlinearity on the high concentration end of the dilution curve is due to the saturation of both the MS detector and the nano HPLC column, whereas the nonlinearity on the low concentration end is mainly because of matrix interference and the trace amount of [ 12 C]-analyte peptide of RelA contaminating the [ 13 C]-analyte peptide internal standard.",

To determine the effect of pre-enrichment on the S/N ratio, we measured the S/N ratio for endogenous RelA in crude versus P028F4-enriched samples. We found that the S/N ratio of endogenous RelA is only 12 when analyzed directly from crude CE (Fig. 10), whereas P028F4 enrichment resulted in a 36-fold increase in S/N ratio (from 12 to 429, Fig. 10).",

Control or TNF\u2423stimulated A549 cells subcellular fractions were separately incubated with Bt-P028F4 or P028A1 aptamers, and captured on SA-magnetic beads. To first determine whether the aptamer capture on SA-magnetic beads was nonsaturating, RelA from increasing numbers of control-or TNF\u2423-stimulated A549 cells were subjected to single-step aptamer enrichment, and detected by Western immunoblot. As seen in Fig. 12, increasing amounts of RelA were seen over the input range of 3-12 \u03eb 10 6 cells only in the TNF\u2423-stimulated extracts.",
                "To quantify the amount of RelA in cells, CE and NE from 6 \u03eb 10 6 cells were prepared and assayed for cytoplasmic and nuclear markers. As seen in Fig. 13A, CE was highly enriched in \u2424-tubulin, whereas \u2424-tubulin was undetectable in NE. Similarly, histone H3 was undetectable in CE and highly enriched in NE. The active RelA in CE and NE was then captured by Bt-aptamer-SA magnetic beads. The proteins were trypsinized on-beads, and RelA and IB\u2423 were quantified with SID-SRM-MS. To determine the fraction of activated RelA complex, total RelA in each subcellular extract was also quantified with SID-SRM-MS. As shown in Fig. 13B, P028F4 demonstrated high specificity toward activated RelA in comparison to P028A1, resulting in 14 -30fold enrichment of activated RelA in CE and NE. With the quantification of SID-SRM-MS, we found that, in unstimulated cells, about 5% of total RelA proteins in the cytoplasm were activated, and only a small amount of activated (and total) RelA was in the nucleus. By contrast, after TNF\u2423 stimulation, the amount of activated RelA in CE increased about sixfold. We also observed a significant amount of activated RelA translocated into the nucleus, where the amount of activated RelA was the same as the total amount of nuclear RelA. Although it was measured, IB\u2423 was not observed in any of the aptamer-enriched samples, a finding that is consistent with the lack of RelA-IB\u2423 complex binding seen in Western blot analysis (Fig. 6B), and in EMSA (Fig. 5)."

                        "Mucosal inflammation produced by the innate immune response is dependent on the NF-B pathway, an intracellular signaling network whose activity is regulated by the formation of dynamic protein interactions. Activated pattern recognition-or cytokine receptors binding to their cognate ligands induce Lys 63 linked polyubiquitination of the (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase) and (TNF-receptor associated factor) adapter molecules (6). These polyubiquitinmodified adapters recruit IKK to the submembranous receptor complex, producing serine phosphorylation and activation of IKK, an event that controls protein stability of IB\u2423 and nuclear translocation of activated RelA. In the nucleus, RelA associates with the p300 histone acetyltransferase, whose promoter recruitment activates expression of downstream inflammatory genetic networks. As a result of direct activation of negative feedback networks including IB\u2423 syn- thesis, RelA undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic oscillation in response to activation (46). In this study, we describe the selection and characterization of a RelA-directed ssDNA oligonucleotide, P028F4, a ligand that directly binds recombinant RelA in vitro, and binds inducible RelA in isolated NEs. P028F4 enriches for serine phosphorylated and p300-com-plexed RelA. We provide evidence that P028F4 has utility as a method for single step enrichment and quantification of activated RelA complexes using quantitative SID-SRM-MS assays. This method has, for the first time, allowed the determination of the fraction of activated RelA in unstimulated cells and the estimation of activated RelA molecules.",
                        "Genetic selection of protein-binding aptamers is a widely exploited method for probing protein function and structure (20,21). Previous efforts isolating RelA ligands have resulted in isolation of ssRNA aptamers and ds-thioate-and dithioate modified ligands that bind NF-B/RelA (47,48). To our knowledge, this work represents the first report of isolation of a ssDNA aptamer that specifically recognizes NF-B/RelA. Our data show that P028F4 binds with a K D of 6.4 \u03eb 10 \u03ea10, representing about 10-fold higher affinity than that of the reported ssRNA aptamers (47). Moreover, this binding is more stable than that described for duplex DNA binding to RelA. Although previous work showing that thioate modified duplex aptamers can recognize specific NF-B isoforms, their on and off-rates have not been reported (48). One property of P028F4 is that this ligand binds with a long off-rate, measured by surface plasmon resonance with a kd of 0.0018 1/s. This characteristic lends itself well to its application for affinity isolations of the target protein and its complexes.",

Third, the beads were resuspended in trypsin proteolysis buffer and the proteins bound on the beads were digested with trypsin. Fourth, the tryptic peptides were eluted from the beads and the SIS standard peptides were spiked before SID-SRM-MS analysis. Finally, RelA was quantified with SID-SRM-MS. suming an immunoglobulin fold structure with \u2424-stranded loops making extensive contract with both DNA base pairs and the sugar-phosphate backbone (49). Our binding characterization shows that ssDNA P028F4 competes with RelA for its cognate dsDNA regulatory sequences. These data may suggest that P028F4 binds RelA on a \u2424-stranded loop that is essential for stable DNA binding, or alternatively, P028F4 may induce RelA to assume a conformational change nonpermissive for DNA interaction. In this regard, we note that a high affinity ssRNA aptamer that selectively binds NF-B p50 isoform also competes with duplex DNA binding by inducing an alternative molecular conformation of the protein (50).",
                        "Because P028F4 is a competitive antagonist of activated RelA DNA binding activity, we explored its properties as an antagonist of RelA transcriptional activity in intact cells. Although we observed that cellular transfection of P028F4 produced additional inhibition of expression of NF-B dependent target genes over that of the control P028A1 aptamer, our experiments also indicate that at the concentrations needed to overcome nonspecific cellular binding (28), there is a nonspecific aptamer effect on TNF\u2423inducible transcription (Fig. 4A). In the ChIP experiments, an even stronger nonspecific aptamer effect was also seen (Fig. 4B). We ascribe these nonspecific P028A1 effects as being due to well-recognized low affinity interactions of cellular transcription factors for nonspecific DNA, and is consistent with its weak abilities to compete for RelA binding in nitrocellulose filter binding assays (Table II), and capture RelA in aptamer-affinity binding studies (Fig. 6A). This nonspecific effect will need to be reduced before ssDNA aptamers like P028F4 can be used to modify RelA action in intact cells.",
                        "An important feature of P028F4-RelA interaction, exploited in this study, is that IB\u2423-complexed RelA is not recognized by P028F4. We base this conclusion on the inability of P028F4 to bind to purified recombinant IB\u2423complexed RelA (Fig. 5), its colocalization with activated EGFP-RelA in isolated nuclei (Fig. 3A), its binding to posttranslationally modified RelA in cellular extracts (Fig. 6B), and its binding enrichment of RelA (over that of IB\u2423) in affinity isolations measured by quantitative SRM-MS assays. Previous work has shown that IB\u2423 binds the NH 2 terminus of RelA with a 1:1 stoichiometry on discontinuous sequences through its seven ankyrin repeat domains. X-Ray crystallographic analysis of the IB\u2423\u2150RelA complex shows that first two ankyrin repeats bind (and mask) the RelA nuclear localization signal, and the sixth repeat occludes the RelA DNA-binding cleft (51). Through these interactions, IB\u2423 is able to both inhibit RelA nuclear translocation as well as its DNA binding activity. More work will be required to map the location of RelA binding by P028F4 and determine its effect, if any, on protein conformation.",
                        "Although DNA aptamers have been used as affinity reagents for identifying biomarkers in complex fluids (52), they have not yet been fully exploited in protein quantification. The approach we demonstrate here combines aptamer-enrichment of RelA and SRM-MS quantification using stable isotopic dilution methods. Compared with direct quantification of RelA and associated proteins from crude cell extracts, the aptamer-based enrichment approach has several advantages. First, using a RelA-specific aptamer to enrich RelA and its associated proteins before SRM-MS analysis dramatically reduces the sample complexity and hence improves the S/N ratio of endogenous RelA 36-fold. Second, aptamer enrichment also reduces the likelihood of the interference of other analytes that have isobaric (or very similar m/z values) to the target peptides. Therefore the specificity and accuracy of SRM assay are significantly improved. Third, aptamer enrichment allows RelA to be isolated from a large amount of protein extract so that the amount of endogenous RelA peptide falls in the middle of the linear dynamic range of the calibration curve, which improves the accuracy and reproducibility of quantification. This feature is especially attractive for quantification of low-abundance proteins, such as RelA or p300 transcription factors, in complex protein mixtures. Finally, because P028F4 selectively recognizes the IB\u2423-free, activated form of RelA, we are able to quantify the abundance of the activated form of RelA. This measurement cannot be accomplished by directly analyzing RelA abundance in crude cellular (or subcellular) extracts.",
                        "Described earlier, RelA is a cytoplasmic transcription factor that undergoes constitutive nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. In the unstimulated cell, RelA is sequestered in the cytoplasm predominately by binding the IB\u2423 inhibitor, an association that masks the nuclear localization sequence, shifting the nuclear-cytoplasmic equilibrium of RelA to the cytoplasmic compartment. Stimulus-induced RelA activation is mediated by IB\u2423 proteolysis, liberating a fraction of sequestered RelA to translocate into the nucleus, shifting the equilibrium to the nuclear compartment. The theoretical understanding of NF-B regulation has been developed using computational modeling approaches, where the relative contributions of the IB isoforms and the effect of the negative feedback loops have been inferred (53,54). Despite this understanding of pathway connections, the dynamics of negative feedback loops are dependent on the fraction of activated RelA that enters the nucleus. This value is based on assumed values because the precise concentration of activated RelA has not yet been experimentally determined.",
                        "This study represents the first quantitative estimate of the number of activated RelA molecules within a cell. The aptamer-SID-SRM estimation of \u03f3200,000 total molecules of RelA/cell with 50,000 molecules/cell of activated RelA in the nucleus after TNF\u2423 stimulation are in good agreement with our previous quantitative Western blot experiments. We also note that the amount of activated RelA is equivalent with the amount of total RelA in both control and TNF\u2423 stimulated nuclei. These findings indicate that the majority of RelA present in the nucleus is in the activated state, consistent with our previous findings by Western immunoblots that the amount of nuclear IB\u2423 is very low. The estimate we make here for the number of activated RelA molecules in CE has not been possible without the development of P028F4, and its ability to discriminate between the IB\u2423-bound and free RelA fractions. We find it interesting that the number of copies of activated RelA in the cytoplasm and nucleus in stimulated cells are similar-a finding that may have implications in understanding the energetics controlling nuclear RelA import.",
                        "In conclusion, RelA aptamer-SID-SRM is a versatile tool for quantification of the abundance of activated protein and its complex. Aptamer enrichment enhances assay specificity, S/N ratio, and sensitivity. Further exploitation of this approach will allow for systematic extension of the dynamics of RelA activation in response to diverse ligands, and exploration of protein interaction networks of the molecule in its activated form."
