The catalysts contain a transition metal, a heteroatom, and carbon. Preferred catalysts include N as the heteroatom and Fe as the transition metal, with active sites having Fe\u2014N4 stoichiometry (FexNyCz) as part of a metal organic framework (MOF) or sequestered within a MOF. Electrocatalysts further including Fe nanoparticles (FeNPs) are also provided.

                        "Use of \u201cdepolarizers\u201d in electrolytic reactions helps lower input electrical energy in electrochemcial processes. For example, in batteries depolarizers help prevent buildup of hydrogen gas bubbles thereby preventing the voltage, and thereby current, from being reduced. Among the known depolarizers, including sulfur dioxide which is used for lowering energy use in production of hydrogen, oxygen consuming cathodes have gained in importance due to the high onset potential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Oxygen depolarized cathodes are used in electrolytic production of chlorine from brine solution, and in its recovery from hydrochloric acid, a byproduct of various chemical processes, e.g., production of polymers notably polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes and polycarbonate, chloroaromatics, and many other components. However, electrochemical chlorine production is currently one of the most energy-intensive processes in the chemical industry, Manufacture of chlorine using oxygen depolarized cathode (ODC) promises to reduce power consumption by as much as 30% compared to standard membrane technology, and is also accompanied with a cut in indirect carbon dioxide emissions. The process integrates use of oxygen with the reaction taking place at the cathode in the manufacture of chlorine by electrolysis of sodium chloride or HCl to produce water instead of hydrogen gas. Oxygen is pumped into the cathode compartment, which reacts with hydrogen to produce water, and the voltage needed for the electrolysis process is reduced by approximately a third. Thus, feeding of gaseous oxygen enables electrolysis to be performed at a lower voltage.",

                        "with a theoretical energy savings of \u02dc700 kWh per ton of Cl2 (g). Thus, the much lower ORR overpotential associated with oxygen consuming gas diffusion electrode (GDE) is expected to result in significant cost and energy savings.",
                        "Operation of an electrolytic cell for chlorine production involves use of aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid at concentration as high as 20% (\u02dc5 M) and temperature as high as 60\u00b0 C., which creates a highly corrosive environment. The presence of anions (chloride ions) in such corrosive environment causes poisoning of the catalyst, thereby reducing the efficiency of the cell. Therefore, there is a need to develop ORR catalysts that can resist anion poisoning.",
                        "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the most studied reactions in energy conversion systems due to the large overpotential caused by the slow kinetics. Due to the lower proton conductivity and permeability of oxygen in the phosphoric acid environment, high loadings of metal are required. Traditionally platinum based electrocatalyst have been used to facilitate ORR in acidic media, but the scarcity of these materials significantly increases the cost of the system. In addition to the economic disadvantage of platinum based electrocatalyst, there is also the issue of poisoning of these materials by the adsorption of the dihydrogen phosphate anion. The number of electrons transferred per active site of Pt per second is diminished by approximately 70% in the presence of moderate concentrations of phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC) are successfully commercialized and presently operate at 80% combined heat and power efficiency, but the cathode materials suffer poisoning effects from the dihydrogen phosphate ion adsorption (H2O4\u2212) limiting the performance. Anion adsorption is structure dependent and it has been shown that some Pt-alloys exhibit a heightened tolerance to phosphate poisoning (He, Q. PhysChemChemPhys. 2010. 12, 12544) but cost is still an issue. However, non-platinum group metal catalysts (NPMC) for ORR containing Fe and/or Co have been investigated and progress has been made in developing synthetic strategy for preparing these NPMC have now made these materials viable contenders with Pt-based catalysts for use in acid based systems. (Jaouen, F. et al., 2011)",
                        "Current state of the art catalyst for ODC is rhodium based chalcogenite (RhxSy/C), currently produced by DeNora. The RhxSy/C catalyst outperforms the extremely ORR active carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) catalysts in resisting anion poisoning. The Pt/C catalyst is easily poisoned by chloride ions. Despite a lower activity for oxygen reduction relative to state of the art Pt-based electrocatalysts in most systems, RhxSy is not severely depolarized by contaminants such as chloride ions and assorted organics. However, Rh is a precious metal and the cost of RhxSy/C is a drawback for successful commercialization of RhxSy/C.",
                        "Anion poisoning, which is a common problem in electrocatalysis in aqueous media, is a result of strong interaction of catalytic metal nanoparticles (Pt, Rh, Ru, etc.) with impurities at potentials above potential of zero charge (PZC). The poisoning blocks access of the reactants (e.g., oxygen in ORR reactions) to the active centers on the metal surface, resulting in increased overpotential. Chemisorption of any species, e.g., anions, on the metal surface depends on the free energy of adsorption and free energy of solvation of that species. In acidic environment water molecules act as weak anionic species and interact with the metallic surface through the oxygen atoms of hydroxide ions. More electronegative moieties such as chloride or bromide ions, or other anions when present replace the hydroxide ions. The metal-anion interaction grows in strength with increased positive potentials, which is specifically challenging for oxygen reduction reactions as the ORR onset is desired to occur at high potentials. As shown for adsorption of chloride anions on platinum nanoparticles (FIG. 1) even small concentrations of anions result in significant losses in the activity of the catalyst.",
                        "Most reported nonplatinum group metal (non-pgm) catalysts consist of biomimetic Fe\u2014Nx centers which are frequently wrapped within protective graphene layers, and contain non-coordinated metal nanoparticles (FeNPs). The overall catalytic performance and stability of these materials depends upon the structure and distribution of the metal centers throughout the catalyst surface. While the better performing MNC catalyst in this group exhibit promising durability in standard fuel cell environment, most of the protected Fe-consisting nanoparticles are susceptible to oxidation by strong anions like a chloride ion, especially at high concentrations, as in case of catastrophic cathode flooding with concentrated hydrochloric acid in chlorine recovery HCl electrolyzers."

                        "The invention provides highly anion resistant electrocatalysts suitable for catalyzing an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The catalysts contain a transition metal which is a non-noble metal (i.e., non-platinum group metal), carbon, and a heteroatom organized into graphene-like sheets containing the heteroatoms, which coordinate the evenly distributed atoms of the transition metal. As a result of the pyrolysis step used to form the catalyst, the catalyst structure is cross-linked and therefore robust. In various embodiments the catalysts include N as the heteroatom and Fe as the transition metal which form active sites having Fe\u2014N4 stoichiometry (FexNyCz) as part of a metal organic framework (MOF), or associated with a MOF by incorporation into pores of the MOF. In other embodiments the electrocatalysts further include nanoparticles of Fe (FeNPs) or another transition metal. Applications of the catalysts described herein include preparation of oxygen decoupled cathodes (ODC) for chlorine evolution using, e.g., chlor-alkali cells or HCl electrolyzers; and for use in fuel cells, such as phosphoric acid fuel cells which use phosphoric acid as the membrane electrolyte. Phosphoric acid fuel cells are successfully commercialized and presently operate at 80% combined heat and power efficiency, but the cathode materials suffer poisoning effects from the dihydrogen phosphate ion adsorption (H2O4\u2212) limiting the performance. (Shah et al., 2007), which are overcome by the catalysts of the present invention.",
                        "The FexNyCz active site containing electrocatalysts described here are comparable in performance to state of the art catalysts using noble metals, e.g., Pt/C and RhxSy/C, with regard to chlorine evolution (chlor-alkali cells and HCL electrolyzers), or with regard to production of current (fuel cells). The present catalysts are superior to the state of the art catalysts in resisting anion poisoning, e.g., chloride ion poisoning (chlor-alkali cell and HCL electrolyzer), or dihydrogen phosphate ion poisoning (phosphoric acid fuel cells).",
                        "The new ODC materials derived from MOF described herein are immune to anion poisoning (FIG. 2), are capable of reducing overall cell voltage below that required for a state of art RhxSyC catalyst, and possess comparable durability, even in case of the catastrophic events such as a power outage (FIG. 3), resulting at least in part from their crosslinked structure. The ORR polarization of electrolytic reactions measured using a RDE with a FexNyCz catalyst at 1M HCl (solid line) or at 1M HClO4 (dashed line, no chloride ion) at room temperature is shown in FIG. 2A. Tafel plots of the electrolytic reactions (FIG. 2A) are shown in FIG. 2B, and the effect of chloride anions on ORR activity is summarized in Table 1 below. Table 2 below shows the results of FT fitting of the FexNyCz material before and after the simulated shutdown (FIG. 3).",
                        "Analysis of a variety of non-precious metal (NPM) electrocatalysts with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that regardless of the synthetic technique and precursors used to the generate the electrocatalysts, they were found to have two characteristic scattering paths which differ only in prevalence. The encapsulated FeMOF is mostly comprised of FeNPs, indicated by the Fe\u2014Fe scattering in the fourier transform plot (FIG. 19A). There is a minor contribution of a Fe\u2014C/N/O scattering path. However XAS is unable to differentiate the exact nature of the element surrounding Fe due to their similar atomic number. That this catalyst is mostly comprised of Fe NPs is further supported by the absence of the Fe2+/Fe3+ edge shift in the x-ray-near-edge-spectrum (XANES) plot.",
                        "The immunity of the MNC catalysts described here to chloride ion originates mainly from the unique nature of the metal-based active site that dominate in these catalysts. In some embodiments, the catalyst contains highly active and corrosion resistant nanoparticles. In general, the MOF-derived FeNC catalyst described here consists of two main types of metal centers. The majority of metal centers are crystalline phase FexNyCz nanoparticles, and amorphous Fe\u2014N4 centers incorporated into carbon cavity (FIG. 2D). Neither metal center is affected by chloride anions (FIG. 3). This is represented by RDE ORR polarization curves (FIG. 2A) and the corresponding in-situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) spectra of the catalyst (FIG. 3C). Both metal species sustain their catalytic structure even after being subjected to flooding with hot 5M hydrochloric acid (5M HCl), resulting in the catastrophic shutdown.",
                        "Further provided by the invention are expedited synthetic routes to non-platinum group (non PGM) electrocatalysts suitable for application to ORR. The synthesis of the electrocatalysts of the invention involves the synthesis of MOFs. Previously established syntheses of MOFs have required solvothermal reaction between an organic ligand and a transition metal salt dissolved in an organic solvent. Typical reaction run times of previously described syntheses range from 24-72 h in a programmable furnace tube (or other source of controlled heat) heated at 100-180\u00b0 C. The reaction product had to be subsequently washed with an organic solvent to provide the porous framework of the MOF in crystalline form (Yaghi, 2006). In previous methods the MOFs had to be manually mixed with a nitrogen-containing catalytic active site precursor and a metal source external of the framework for incorporation into the MOF infrastructure during manual mixing (Proietti, E. 2011). The product was then made conductive by pyrolysis at 900-1200\u00b0 C. and the activated material was coated onto the fuel cell cathode to catalyze four electron oxygen reduction to water. Preparation of such catalysts previously required multiple lengthy steps including a one to three day synthesis of the framework itself (Yaghi, 2006). Manual mixing of the catalytic precursors (metal salt and nitrogen-containing organic molecule) into the MOF pores resulted in lack of sample homogeneity with respect to the transition metal, resulting in poorer catalytic properties. The step of mixing was accompanied by significant potential for incorporation of impurities into the sample.",
                        "The problem of multiple lengthy steps and manual mixing have been overcome by two distinct synthetic routes of the present invention: (1) microwave-accelerated synthesis of the MOF, and (2) one-pot MOF formation-catalytic precursor encapsulation. The resulting products have shown RDE results comparable to that of catalysts derived from previously established methods.",
                        "The benefits of using the methods of synthesis described here over earlier methods include: (1) shortening of reaction time for MOF synthesis from days to hours or minutes; (2) chemical encapsulation of catalytic active site precursors for ORR during the synthesis as opposed to crude mixing of precursors into the MOF pores, resulting in a cleaner product with more effective active sites; (3) less equipment required; and (4) use of ambient conditions. The synthetic methods of the present invention also can be applied to expedited syntheses of metal organic frameworks for other uses.",
                        "As an example of the synthesis of a MOF using microwave-accelerated synthesis, zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (Zif-8) was produced, and the product characterized and confirmed with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and infrared spectroscopy (IR), and analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion detection (EDS), and rotating disc electrode (RDE) apparatus.",
                        "MOF was also synthesized with simultaneous chemical encapsulation of catalytic precursors. The complete synthesis was carried out in one pot, in contrast to the traditional procedure in which MOF is synthesized in a first step, and is subsequently mixed manually with the catalytic precursors in a second step. In the traditional method, following a multi-day synthesis of the metal organic framework, the MOF has to be violently ball milled for 1-5 hours with the dry catalytic precursors to incorporate them into the framework matrix. Such mixing, even at lengthy run times, does not ensure homogeneous distribution of the precursors into the MOF, and cannot ensure that the precursors enter the MOF pores, as opposed to being simply distributed on the MOF surface.",
                        "Chemical encapsulation made possible by the one-pot MOF formation-chemical precursor encapsulation described here (Example 2) ensures more homogenous distribution of the catalytic precursors into the MOF pores compared to mixing pre synthesized MOF with catalytic precursors by ball milling. Further, since both the MOF synthesis and the precursor encapsulation can be accomplished in the same pot, there is less opportunity for sample contamination. Further still, since the pores form around the precursors, there is a greater opportunity for the precursors to be captured inside of the pores compared to the use of manual mixing or ball milling of a pre formed MOF with catalytic precursors."
