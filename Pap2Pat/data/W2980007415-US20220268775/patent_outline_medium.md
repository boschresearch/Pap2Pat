# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce PD-1 and its role

## SUMMARY

- motivate sPD-1 as biomarker
- describe methods for selecting patients
- describe methods for predicting survival and treatment

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce sPD-1 as immune checkpoint
- motivate sPD-1 as prognostic biomarker
- summarize inconsistent reports of sPD-1 levels in various cancers
- describe study on sPD-1 levels in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer
- introduce present disclosure on using sPD-1 as immune marker in patients with metastatic melanoma
- describe experimental evaluation of sPD-1 levels in patients with metastatic melanoma
- disclose methods for selecting cancer patients for cancer vaccine therapy
- describe improved methods of treating cancer patients with therapeutic cancer vaccines
- disclose methods for predicting survival of cancer patients after autologous cancer vaccine therapy
- define immune checkpoint inhibition therapy
- describe examples of immune checkpoint inhibitors
- define programed death-1 (PD-1) and its binding partner PD-L1
- provide examples of monoclonal antibodies that target PD-1/PD-L1
- define "treating" or "treatment" in the context of disease management

### EXAMPLES

- introduce patients and blood samples
- describe vaccine products and patient outcomes
- summarize eligibility criteria and patient characteristics
- analyze soluble PD-1 levels
- perform statistical analysis
- present results of sPD-1 data
- show baseline sPD-1 levels are not prognostic for survival
- demonstrate changes in sPD-1 levels are not predictive of survival
- suggest combination of baseline sPD-1 levels and changes in sPD-1 levels are predictive for survival
- present examples of sPD-1 levels and survival rates
- associate low sPD-1 levels with good survival in DCV-treated patients
- show no association between sPD-1 levels and survival in TCV-treated patients
- define two cohorts based on baseline sPD-1 levels and changes in sPD-1
- show better survival in DCV-treated patients with low/decreased sPD-1
- describe false positive and false negative cases
- analyze TCV-treated patients and show no significant difference in survival
- discuss predictive value of sPD-1 levels and changes in sPD-1
- suggest using sPD-1 levels as a prognostic marker
- discuss potential association between sPD-1 and suppression of immune responses
- define terms used in the specification and claims
- describe the scope of the invention and its limitations
- discuss the use of Markush groups in the claims
- describe variations on the described embodiments
- provide a general statement on the scope of the invention
