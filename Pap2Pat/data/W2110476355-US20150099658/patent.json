                        "The early detection of viruses including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) requires multiplex detection of anti-glycoprotein 41 (gp41) antibodies in biological samples. The availability of high-affinity, highly selective molecular moieties that recognize anti-gp41 antibodies from complex biological mixtures is a critical component for accurate detection of anti-gp41 antibodies that may indicate HIV infections.",
                        "Detecting the immune response to an infectious agent can provide a useful in vitro diagnostic surrogate relative to direct pathogen detection. Such assays are commonly used for detecting HIV infection because of HIV's characteristic immunopathology. However, direct detection of HIV viral RNA and p24 antigen is only effective at an early stage of infection, approximately 2-6 weeks of initial exposure. Antibodies against HIV envelope proteins emerge in patients' blood around 3-4 weeks of infection as the viral RNA and p24 levels decline as a result of immunocomplex formation. The high serum level of anti-HIV IgG is maintained throughout the course of clinical latency (2-20+ years), during which time viral antigens are under detection limits until the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Viral load and CD4 cell counts are mainly used for prognostic purposes to monitor the efficacy of treatments; however viral load is sometimes used for the diagnosis of infant HIV infections where antibody-based assays are not applicable. Assays for anti-HIV antibodies are the most widely used diagnostic test both in cases where infection is presumed to have occurred more than 6 weeks prior to testing, and for epidemiological reasons, to estimate the incidence of HIV in a population, since, with the exception of infant HIV, virtually 100% of the infected individuals express these antibodies. Typically in these assays, immunogenic and conserved antigens from the HIV are expressed as regions of a single chimeric protein. That chimeric protein is then used to capture specific antibodies from the body fluid (e.g. blood, saliva or urine) of potentially infected patients; a positive assay result implies infection. However, the polyclonal diversity of antibodies across a patient population can translate into large variations in assay performance from patient to patient. In addition, the chimeric recombinant proteins are biological reagents, and so may have limitations related to shelf life and batch-to-batch variability. These limitations can adversely influence the performance of a diagnostic test, especially one that is deployed in harsh physical environments. Accordingly, there remains a need for new compositions and assays for the diagnosis of HIV."

However, many real proteins comprise regions of nonrandom sequences, which may be homopolymeric tracts, short-period repeats, or regions enriched in one or more amino acids. Such low-complexity regions may be aligned between unrelated proteins even though other regions of the protein are entirely dissimilar. A number of low-complexity filter programs can be employed to reduce such low-complexity alignments. For example, the SEG (Wooten and Federhen, (1993) Comput. Chem. 17:149-63) and XNU (Claverie and States, (1993) Comput. Chem. 17:191-201) low-complexity filters can be employed alone or in combination.",

When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences, which differ by such conservative substitutions, are said to have \u201csequence similarity\u201d or \u201csimilarity.\u201d Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., according to the algorithm of Meyers and Miller, (1988) Computer Applic. Biol. Sci. 4:11-17, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif., USA).",

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.",

One of skill will recognize that these values can be appropriately adjusted to determine corresponding identity of proteins encoded by two nucleotide sequences by taking into account codon degeneracy, amino acid similarity, reading frame positioning and the like. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences for these purposes normally means sequence identity of between 55-100%, preferably at least 55%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90% and most preferably at least 95%.",

                                "A high quality monoclonal antibody possesses low-nanomolar affinity and high target specificity. Interestingly, structural and genetic analyses of the antigen recognition surface have shown that the majority of the molecular diversity of the variable loops is contained in a single highly variable loop (CDR-H3). In humans, this loop ranges in size from 1-35 residues (15 on average), can adopt a wide range of structural conformations, and is responsible for most of the interactions with the antigen. The other five loops are significantly less diverse and adopt only a handful of conformations. This suggests that a carefully selected \u201canchor\u201d peptide can dominate the mode and strength of the interaction between a capture agent and its target protein. It also suggests that other peptide components, while providing only modest contributions to the total interaction energy, can supply important scaffolding features and specificity elements.",
                                "In situ click chemistry is a technique in which a small molecule enzymatic inhibitor is separated into two moieties, each of which is then expanded into a small library\u2014one containing acetylene functionalities, and the other containing azide groups. The enzyme itself then assembles the \u2018best fit\u2019 inhibitor from these library components by selectively promoting 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the acetylene and azide groups to form a triazole linkage (the \u2018click\u2019 reaction). The protein effectively plays the role of an extremely selective variant of the Cu(I) catalyst that is commonly used for such couplings. The enzyme promotes the click reaction only between those library components that bind to the protein in the right orientation. The resultant inhibitor can exhibit far superior affinity characteristics relative to the initial inhibitor that formed the basis of the two libraries.",
                                "Sequential in situ click chemistry extends the in situ click chemistry concept to enable the discovery of multiligand capture agents (see: USSN 20100009896, incorporated herein by reference). This process was used previously to produce a triligand capture agent against the model protein carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). Sequential in situ click chemistry has several advantages. First, structural information about the protein target is replaced by the ability to sample a very large chemical space to identify the ligand components of the capture agent. For example, an initial ligand may be identified by screening the protein against a large (>106 element) one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) peptide library, where the peptides themselves may be comprised of natural, non-natural, and/or artificial amino acids. The resultant anchor ligand is then utilized in an in situ click screen, again using a large OBOC library, to identify a biligand binder. A second advantage is that the process can be repeated, so that the biligand is used as an anchor to identify a triligand, and so forth. The final capture agent can then be scaled up using relatively simple and largely automated chemistries, and it can be developed with a label, such as a biotin group, as an intrinsic part of its structure. This approach permits the exploration of branched, cyclic, and linear capture agent architectures. While many strategies for protein-directed multiligand assembly have been described, most require detailed structural information on the target to guide the screening strategy, and most (such as the original in situ click approach), are optimized for low-diversity small molecule libraries.",
                                "As described herein, an iterative in situ click chemistry approach was utilized to synthesize a biligand capture agent that specifically binds anti-gp41 antibodies. This in situ click chemistry approach comprised two steps. First, a synthetic polypeptide derived from gp41 was selected as the initial screening target. Second, the secondary ligand selection process took advantage of the fact that an in situ click screen, in which an anchor ligand and full-length protein target are screened against a large OBOC library, will selectively generate multiligand products on the hit beads. This concept was expanded in the form of \u201cproduct screens,\u201d in which the presence of on-bead clicked product is taken to be the signature of a hit bead. Such a product screen can be utilized to increase both the affinity and/or selectivity of the final multiligand capture agent.",
                                "The capture agents generated by the methods disclosed herein were found to display binding affinity for anti-gp41 antibodies. The capture agents were shown to function as both capture and detection agents in ELISA assays and efficiently immunoprecipitate anti-gp41 antibodies from dilute human serum."

                                "An approach for synthesizing molecules that bind to antibodies is described and demonstrated. The invention includes first preparing a peptide or polypeptide fragment corresponding to the epitope targeted by the antibody. That polypeptide can be site-specifically modified by either substituting one of the naturally occurring amino acids with an artificial amino acid, or the polypeptide fragment is modified after synthesis by chemically altering a specific amino acid. In both cases, the polypeptide can be modified to incorporate either an alkyne or an azide chemical group near the site-specific modification. That azide (or alkyne) containing fragment is then incubated with a very large molecular library. This library, while typically chemically diverse, is also characterized by the fact that each element contains an alkyne (or, instead, each element contains an azide) group. The incubation can be done under conditions that the modified polypeptide fragment can provide a catalytic scaffold for promoting the covalent coupling between select library elements and the polypeptide fragment. In this embodiment, it promotes this coupling by catalyzing the formation of a triazole linkage that is the reaction product of the acetylene and azide groups. According to several embodiments, the selectivity of this catalyzed process is very high. This means that only a very small fraction of the elements in the molecular library will be coupled. Those elements are identified through analytical techniques, and then tested for binding to the polypeptide fragment, or to the entire protein biomolecule from which the polypeptide fragment was extracted. This approach provides a route towards identifying molecules that selectively bind to the intended epitope of the protein target. Approaches known in the art may then be utilized to increase the selectivity and the affinity of the identified binders, without sacrificing their epitope selective binding characteristics.",
                                "The following steps are performed in one embodiment of the process. An antibody target (1) is selected for developing capture agent molecule that will bind to that antibody. The antibody is known to target a protein epitope with a known sequence of amino acids (2). A polypeptide fragment (3) corresponding to the epitope of the protein is synthesized, but with two modifications. First, (3) is either substituted or chemically modified so as to provide an azide or alkyne group. Second, a site on the polypeptide is modified (4) with a label (a fluorophore or biotin group, for example) for use during the screening steps. There are many ways through which this label can be introduced.",

Of those hit molecules, a small number (1-10) will be molecules that specifically bind to the antibody of interest. Approaches described herein can then be utilized to increase the affinity and specificity of those antibody-specific binders."

The protein targets are human monoclonal antibodies raised against variants of the gp41 epitope represented by the anchor peptide.",

Studies have shown that a large fraction of HIV-1-positive patients develop antibodies against this epitope. The strategy for sampling the polyclonal diversity of such antibodies was to develop PCC Agents that exhibited both differential, as well as similar avidities for human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against different parts of this epitope. A key decision in this regard involves the selection of the anchor peptides from which the PCC Agents are developed. For this task, the polypeptide fragment corresponding to residues 600-612 of gp41 was modified with artificial amino acids at multiple locations, and the ability of these modified peptides was tested to detect two different monoclonal anti-gp41 antibodies 3D6 and 4B3 (Polymun, Klosterneuburg, Austria). The 3D6 mAb was raised against the epitope SGKLIC, whereas the 4B3 mAb was raised against SGKLICTTA. One anchor peptide, A21, was synthesized by adding a propargyl glycine (Pra) residue at the C-terminus of the residues 600-612 of gp41. This anchor peptide was also N-terminally tagged with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) oligomer bridge and a biotin label. For a second anchor peptide (A22), Leu-607 was substituted with Pra. A22 also included an N-terminal PEG-biotin label. Relative affinities of A21 and A22 for 3D6 and 4B3 were determined by sandwich ELISA. Biotinylated anchor ligands A21 and A22 were immobilized on streptavidin-coated 96-well plated at a concentration of 100 nM, and incubated with the solutions of target anti-HIV antibodies 3D6 and 4B3 at 100 nM in TBS. Captured antibody was detected by peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. A22 differentially detected 3D6 (Kd>10 \u03bcM) and 4B3 (Kd=1-50 nM) (FIG. 2). A21 and A22 were then separately developed into PCC agents against 3D6 and 4B3, respectively.",

The OBOC library is synthesized on TentaGel resin (Rapp Polymere, Tuebingen, Germany), and is a comprehensive library of 5-mers with a 6th amino acid at the N-terminus presenting an azide functionality. To help ensure chemical and biochemical stability, the OBOC library is comprised of non-natural (D) stereoisomers of the 20 natural amino acids, excluding cysteine and methionine. The in situ screen is designed to identify a secondary (2\u00b0) peptide that, when coupled to the anchor, forms a biligand with increased selectivity and/or affinity for the target IgG. The screen proceeds stepwise. In the first step (not shown in FIG. 3) the OBOC library is cleared of beads that exhibit non-specific binding to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (SA-AP), which is used as a detection reagent in a later step. Step 2 is a target screen, and so is designed to detect the presence of the bound IgG target to specific beads, and defines possible hits. The step 3 screen is designed to remove those beads from the pool of potential hits that also exhibit binding to off-target serum proteins. Step 4 is called a product screen, and is unique to sequential in situ click screens. This screen is designed to detect for the presence of in situ clicked reaction products, which are those hit beads containing the triazole-linked anchor peptide. Typically, Step 2 yields a few hundred hits (\u02dc0.05% of the OBOC library). Step 3 reduces that pool by a factor of 2 or 3 to about 100 hits, and Step 4 further reduces the number of hits to around 10. This is a manageable number, meaning that each hit can be separately synthesized as a biligand using Cu(I) catalyzed click chemistry to couple the anchor and 2\u00b0 peptides."

                                "The PCC Agent cocktail and the standard antigen were co-evaluated against a panel of clinical samples using sandwich ELISAs. Serum samples were collected from nine HIV-1-positive patients in Southern California. The standard antigen is a recombinant chimeric protein containing a fragment of HIV-1 gp41 (residues 546-692), the \u201cO\u201d group HIV-1 gp41 immunodominant region (residues 580-623), and a fragment of HIV-2 gp36 (residues 591-617). A good performance of this chimeric antigen has been reported (see, e.g., Chin C D, Laksanasopin T, Cheung Y K, Steinmiller D, Linder V, et al. (2011): Microfluidics-based diagnostics of infectious diseases in the developing world. Nat Med 17: 1015-1019). For the comparison assays, streptavidin-coated 96-well plates were saturated with the PCC Agent cocktail or chemically biotinylated chimera in triplicates. Serum samples were diluted to 1% v/v in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated in the wells for 1 hr at room temperature. Unbound proteins were washed off and captured IgG was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG-Fc antibody. The comparison assay results for the patient serum samples along with a healthy control are shown in FIG. 7A. Comparative performance of the PCC Agent cocktail versus the commercial chimeric protein, was determined using sandwich ELISAs to detect anti-HIV-1 IgGs from a panel of sera samples collected from nine HIV-positive patients. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) for each sample is normalized against the A450 for the healthy control, to yield a measurement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the assay. The PCC Agent cocktail, which is designed to capture a subset of anti-gp41 IgGs, exhibits superior performance for every sample, even though the chimeric protein is designed to capture antibodies against multiple HIV-1-associated epitopes (those containing fragments of HIV-1 gp41, \u201cO\u201d group HIV-1 gp41 immunodominant region, and HIV-2 gp39). For the assays, the PCC agent cocktail and the biotinylated chimeric antigen were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated 96-well plate and incubated with diluted patient serum (1% v/v). Captured anti-HIV antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in these assays is defined as the measured ELISA signal for a given patient sample, divided by that for the healthy control. The PCC Agent cocktail performed at least as well, and typically much better, than the standard chimeric protein antigen. The average S/N improvement by the cocktail PCC agent over the chimeric antigen was a factor of 2.5.",
                                "We then tested the PCC Agents for thermal stability. The PCC Agent cocktail component (iii) were synthesized at a large scale for an academic setting (\u02dc7 mg, FIG. 7B) and the lyophilized samples were stored under N2 at 25\u00b0 C., 37\u00b0 C., or 57\u00b0 C. for 58 days. The samples were then analyzed by HPLC to determine the presence of any degradation product. The traces of the peptide at each temperature are nearly identical, indicating little to no degeneration at these temperatures (FIG. 7B). The performance of these stored PCC Agents was then also tested in an ELISA, with no detectable loss of performance (FIG. 7B)."
