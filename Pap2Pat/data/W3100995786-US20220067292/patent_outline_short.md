# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce virtual assistants and limitations

## BRIEF SUMMARY

- propose data-driven approach
- describe limitations of data-driven approach
- propose schema-guided approach
- propose template-guided approach
- describe benefits of template-guided approach
- summarize improved approaches

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe processing system architecture

### Example Systems

- describe processing system components
- describe user interface subsystem

### Schema-Guided Text Generation

- receive and process user input
- identify APIs to be called and data to be passed
- check for additional information needed from user
- issue API calls and receive responses
- generate dialogue acts based on API responses
- replace slots with natural language descriptions
- concatenate dialogue acts and generate natural language response

### Template-Guided Text Generation

- receive user input
- process input to identify APIs and data
- check for additional information
- issue API calls and generate templated responses
- concatenate responses and generate natural language output
