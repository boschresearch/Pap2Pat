# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce virtual assistants and their limitations

## BRIEF SUMMARY

- propose data-driven approach
- describe traditional data-driven approach limitations
- propose schema-guided approach
- describe schema-guided approach benefits
- propose template-guided approach
- describe traditional template-guided approach limitations
- describe improved template-guided approach
- describe benefits of improved template-guided approach
- describe virtual assistant system components
- describe system functionality
- describe method for generating natural language response
- describe variations of method

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe processing system for performing methods

### Example Systems

- introduce processing system diagram
- describe processing system components
- explain distributed processing system
- describe user interface subsystem
- discuss processor and memory configurations

### Schema-Guided Text Generation

- introduce schema-guided approach
- describe receiving and processing user input
- identify APIs to be called and data to be passed
- check for additional information needed
- issue API calls
- receive API responses and generate dialogue acts
- repeat API calls as necessary
- generate dialogue acts for each response
- determine if further information is needed
- include additional information in dialogue acts
- replace slots with natural language descriptions
- concatenate dialogue acts
- provide concatenated dialogue act to NLG model
- generate natural language response

### Template-Guided Text Generation

- depict method
- receive user input
- process input to identify APIs
- check for additional information
- issue API calls
- receive API responses
- generate templated responses
- concatenate templated responses
- provide concatenated sequence to NLG model
- generate natural language response
- provide response to user
