    "abstract": "A highly discriminative and information-rich diagnostic assay for H5N1 avian influenza would meet immediate patient care needs and provide valuable information for public health interventions, e.g., tracking of new and more dangerous variants by geographic area as well as avian-to-human or human-to-human transmission. In the present study, we have designed a rapid assay based on multilocus nucleic acid sequencing that focuses on the biologically significant regions of the H5N1 hemagglutinin gene. This allows the prediction of viral strain, clade, receptor binding properties, low- or high-pathogenicity cleavage site and glycosylation status. H5 HA genes were selected from nine known high-pathogenicity avian influenza subtype H5N1 viruses, based on their diversity in biologically significant regions of hemagglutinin and/or their ability to cause infection in humans. We devised a consensus pre-programmed pyrosequencing strategy, which may be used as a faster, more accurate alternative to de novo sequencing. The available data suggest that the assay described here is a reliable, rapid, information-rich and cost-effective approach for definitive diagnosis of H5N1 avian influenza. Knowledge of the predicted functional sequences of the HA will enhance H5N1 avian influenza surveillance efforts.",

                "The worldwide spread of high-pathogenicity H5N1 avian influenza A virus in poultry and wild birds has resulted in many human infections, with high fatality rates. Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not yet occurred, concern about a potential pandemic continues to mount. The current HA lineage of H5N1 avian influenza was first found among domestic poultry populations in 1996 in southern China [1]. A similar H5N1 influenza virus spread directly from poultry to humans in Hong Kong in 1997, causing death in 6 out of 18 persons diagnosed with infection with this virus [2]. While the massive culling of poultry in 1997 temporarily eradicated the virus in Hong Kong, the virus has continued to spread across Asia, causing human deaths in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, China and elsewhere [2], [3]. The rapid spread of H5N1 in birds from Asia into Europe and Africa in recent months has intensified efforts to control the virus and avert a pandemic. To address the recognized need for rapid, low-cost diagnosis, tracking critically important genetic changes in the virus among animal and human host populations, and identifying specific viral clades [4], we have developed high-throughput methods for monitoring viral mutations that may control virulence and transmissibility in humans [5]. Accurate and rapid detection and tracking of H5N1 will be critical to prevent or control a potential pandemic.",
                "Diagnosis of influenza type A infections in clinical microbiology laboratories has traditionally been performed using cell culture and/or direct fluorescent antibody assays [5]\u2013[7]. These methods are time-consuming and require biosafety level 3 enhanced biocontainment facilities and equipment to protect laboratory personnel from exposure to H5N1 cultured in the laboratory. Because these facilities not widely available, culture-based assays are increasingly being replaced in clinical settings by the various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods [8]\u2013[11].",
                "PCR is more sensitive than traditional tests and detection does not require viable virus or morphologically intact infected cells in the sample. A PCR-based molecular diagnostic test is currently the most widely used by public health laboratories to diagnose the presence of H5N1 in clinical specimens [12]. We hypothesized that coupling a PCR assay to a rapid sequencing method would further increase the value of molecular techniques for virus identification and characterization, especially if implemented into automated robotic platforms in the near future. Nucleic acid sequencing is considered the most reliable and highest-resolution method for virus identification, but is typically too slow and costly to use as a primary assay. Samples can be prepared sequentially for PCR diagnosis of H5N1 influenza virus, and pyrosequencing, yielding results in approximately 90 minutes, with immediate availability of the viral sequence data. The speed, sensitivity, precision, low cost, and high throughput of this method give it substantial advantages in H5N1 influenza characterization. We have designed an assay that focuses on three biologically significant regions of the H5N1 hemagglutinin gene (Figure 1), including sites informative of viral ancestry.",
                "Influenza type A viruses have an eight-segment negative-sense RNA genome complexed with nucleoprotein and polymerase surrounded by the matrix protein and a lipid envelope that contains two integral membrane glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), protruding from the virion surface. The HA binds to sialic acid-terminated glycan receptors on the host cell surface, triggering virion uptake by endocytosis. Human respiratory tract cells have predominantly alpha 2-6 linked sialic acid receptors, whereas duck intestine has predominantly alpha 2-3 linked sialic acid receptors. Host-adapted human and avian influenza viruses selectively bind to homologous variant sialoside structures [13]\u2013[15]. The HA receptor binding site is located at the convergence of one helix, two loops and three single residues near the top of the molecule; amino acid residues in the 184-186 (188-190 H3) helix as well as the 130\u2013134 (134-138 H3) and 217\u2013224 (221-228 H3) loops make up the rims, whereas residues 91 (98 H3), 149 (153 H3) and 179 (183 H3) form the floor of the cavity (H5 numbering; references: [16], [17]). In the H3 subtype of HA, amino acids 222 and 224 (226 and 228 H3) are major determinants of human or avian host sialic acid specificity of the virus; alpha 2-6 linkages in human viruses and alpha 2-3 linkages in avian viruses [18]. Similar changes have been documented for the H1 HA that caused the 1918 so-called Spanish influenza pandemic [19], [20]. Mutation at amino acid 223 from serine-to-asparagine (227 in H3) in a 2003 human H5N1 isolate (A/Hong Kong/213/03) maintained avian-like binding specificity of alpha 2-3 linked sialic acids but also had increased binding to alpha 2-6 sialic acid linkages [17].",
                "The HA is also responsible for cell entry by mediating fusion of the endosomal and viral membranes. The HA requires proteolytic cleavage to become functional in membrane fusion. Cleavage, mediated by host proteases, results in two disulfide-linked subunits, HA1 and HA2. The HA1 region of the HA gene encompasses three sites of known biological significance:",
                "Recent phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 evolution indicates that distinct major and minor clades have emerged among HA gene lineages; the two most important ones of these from a public health perspective are termed clades 1 and 2. These two clades are identifiable with two amino acids, 124 and 212 (129 and 216 in H3) [4]. These clade distinctions may be antigenically significant; therefore clade identification may aid selection of appropriate vaccines. Rapid H5N1 identification will assist in pinpointing the source of particularly virulent outbreaks, and in targeting limited supplies of vaccines and anti-virals to key regions.",
                "Here, we report the results of a proof-of-principle experiment based on the application of pyrosequencing technology targeting the hemagglutinin gene of H5N1 influenza. The assay uses RT-PCR to amplify a known H5N1-specific region of 768 nucleotides. Subsequent pyrosequencing [24] of strains that are H5N1-positive with ten specific sequencing primers is used to determine HA clade and strain, receptor binding preference, low- or high-pathogenicity cleavage site, and glycosylation status. The assay presented here is considerably more informative than traditional techniques such as real-time PCR, as it not only identifies the H5N1 lineage but also predicts receptor binding properties that could herald the development of human-human transmissibility. This assay would be most advantageous as part of a screening method during high-volumes of H5N1 activity. Also, pyrosequencing has some advantages over Sanger sequencing-based methods, specifically the availability of sequence data directly following the sequencing primer, and the accessibility of the results in real time. Moreover, this assay is specific, rapid and cost-effective."

This was performed using two different biotinylated combinations of PCR primers specific to the H5N1 regions of interest in order to achieve optimal sequencing flexibility of H5N1 isolates, as listed in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 3, either pair of primers provided reliable amplification of H5N1, and neither generated products when used in PCRs with negative controls (total genomic DNA from unrelated human cell lines) (confirmed by Sanger sequencing).",
                        "All of the H5N1 PCR products were sequenced at least twice both by Sanger dideoxy sequencing and pyrosequencing; PCR-positive amplicons generated correct sequence results independent of sequencing method or fragment size. Furthermore, no loops or primer-dimers were observed when primers were pyrosequenced in the absence of template. Representative and typical pyrograms of sample A/Vietnam/HN30408/ 2005, obtained by pyrosequencing, are shown in Figure 4; pyrograms for the remaining eight samples are available as supplementary information. The pyrosequencing run covering the required 14 bases took approximately 15 minutes."

Furthermore, this approach provided accurate sequencing of regions of known biological significance (for supplementary data, see http://bioel.stanford.edu/avianflu/index.html). The results of this assay can be seen in Table 2, which shows the amino acid sequences characteristic of each strain tested.",
                        "In order to characterize the strains based on the HA sequence, pyrograms obtained via pyrosequencing were visually inspected to verify the sequences of functionally relevant sites and the presence of polymorphisms that could serve as lineage markers. These sequences were then compared to known H5N1 sequences for clade and strain identification. Certain positions provided essential information for the identification of signatures important for public health, such as changes in the receptor binding site which could signal an increase in the ability of the virus to transmit from human- to-human. The prototype receptor binding site for avian isolates in amino acids 221-224 of the HA1 is GQSG. One human isolate, Hong Kong/213/03, has a mutation at amino acid 223, S->N, which switches the affinity of the hemagglutinin from alpha 2-3 linked sialic acid to the alpha 2-6 linked sialic acid preferred by human influenza viruses. This mutation was detected by a single nucleotide change, G->A, in the sequence of the receptor binding active site. Rapid characterization of the receptor binding active site and other active sites of the hemagglutinin is critical in identifying viruses with increased pandemic potential."

                "Our initial results indicate that targeted pyrosequencing approach can clearly distinguish among different strains of H5N1, and can accurately sequence regions of known biological significance such as receptor binding (supplementary data: http://bioel.stanford.edu/avianflu/index.html). The HA sequence results obtained by pyrosequencing were 100% identical to those obtained by the Sanger method (two replicates were performed to cross-verify results). Three pyrosequencing replicates, with nine samples at ten sites, were performed: two with a de novo dispensation and one with a pre-programmed dispensation order. Of the three pyrosequencing replicates performed, all successful runs verified one another. Because Sanger sequencing relies on molecular separation of the polymerase-mediated extension of the primer, the first \u223c20\u201350 bases 3\u2032 of the primer are not discernible. In contrast, pyrosequencing provides unambiguous sequence from the first nucleotide 3\u2032 to the primer, increasing the sequence information yield per assay. This feature of pyrosequencing was exploited by designing H5N1-specific primers adjacent to critical polymorphic sites such that the initial base-callings are usually sufficient to determine the lineage of a given HA gene.",
                "A simpler detection assay giving a positive or negative identification of H5N1 will be helpful, but a more information-rich method is necessary to provide additional information to guide patient care or public health measures, especially as new strains emerge. Indeed, some laboratories are already using pyrosequencing to identify drug-resistant viruses [25]. As H5N1 influenza becomes more prevalent, it will be impractical to perform full sequencing of all isolates in time for analysis of rapidly changing epidemiological trends. Our assay could be a valuable complement to full sequencing at public health laboratories. We have developed a rapid and inexpensive assay based on DNA sequencing for early detection of virus present in host cells. This assay permits rapid, simplified and accurate identification of avian H5N1 influenza A, and consists of simple procedures maintaining high sensitivity and specificity. As new sites of functional relevance are identified, new site-specific primers can be added to broaden the utility of the assay. Expanded knowledge of H5N1 sequence and evolution is likely to contribute to more effective diagnostic methods and treatments that require less investment of time and money.",
                "An additional advantage of pyrosequencing over the Sanger method is its application in genotyping single and multiple HPV infections [26]. This technology is based on the use of multiple sequencing primers in the same pyrosequencing reaction. Pools of primers are chosen based on their position on the target, the sequence information they yield, and their cross-reactivity with other primers in the multiplex assay. Clinically relevant samples containing multiple infections can then be identified and characterized.",
                "These early robust results have validated our approach and selection of specific primers. We have moved toward a further refinement of the assay based on these results. After an initial de novo pyrosequencing run was performed on the H5N1 samples, sequence data for each strain were compiled for each nucleotide site. This information was integrated to produce consensus pre-programmed dispensation orders of nucleotides. This type of pyrosequencing would allow us to obtain sequence results of similarly high quality in 10 to 15 minutes (Figure 5). With this approach, all of the H5N1 subtypes included in this study could be positively identified. New variants would not be fully characterized, but would be heralded by truncated sequences.",
                "In summary, we have developed a reliable, rapid, cost-effective, and information-rich diagnostic assay for H5N1 influenza. This sequence-based method could be extended to include amplicons from other genes of interest; for example, drug targets such as NA and the M2 ion channel [27], [28], or the postulated virulence motifs on NS1 or PB2 [29], [30]. Pyrosequencing is user-friendly, and permits significantly more efficient and rapid genotyping than traditional techniques. This method detects a wide range of influenza A H5N1 subtypes based on sequence information. The assay will allow further development of technology to directly detect H5N1 or specific strains of influenza A in clinical specimens without extensive sample preparation."
