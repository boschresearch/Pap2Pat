Other commonly used markers include the assessment of gene rearrangements involving TMPRSS22-ERG or ETS, PTEN loss, AR amplification, and increased chromosomal instability (for review, see Danila et al., 2011). However, none of these markers provides the complete picture of a patient's prostate cancer due to its heterogeneity and due to the presence or absence of these markers at certain stages during the course of the disease."

                                "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cells that have detached from a primary tumor and circulate in the bloodstream. CTCs are rare cells. For example, one CTC may be present in one billion normal blood cells (Danila et al., 2011). CTCs may constitute seeds for subsequent growth of additional tumors (metastasis) in different tissues.",
                                "Different approaches have been taken to isolate CTCs or to demonstrate their presence indirectly. One commonly cited assay uses an anti-EpCAM antibody to magnetically capture CTCs expressing this antigen on their surfaces with the CellSearchR system (Scher et al., 2005; Berthold et al., 2008; Madan et al., 2011; Fleming et al., 2006; Gulley and Drake, 2011; Bubley et al., 1999; Scher et al., 2008). The draw-backs of this method lie in tumor cell heterogeneity, low EpCAM expression levels on CTCs, EpCAM expression level changes as cells become CTCs, and the possible selection of cells that express the \u201cright\u201d amount of EpCAM since only those will be captured by this method.",
                                "Other approaches rely on the presence of circulating nucleic acids (Schwarzenbach et al., 2011), on immunohistochemistry with anti-cytokeratin 8 and 18 antibodies that are also used in combination with the anti-EpCAM antibodies, or on CTC-chips. Another technology, the EPISPOT test, depletes CD45 cells first and examines the remaining cells. In addition, collagen adhesion matrix assays (CAM assays) have been introduced (for a review on these methods, see Doyen et al., 2011).",
                                "Recently, a new approach that isolates CTCs by size using a filter device that collects CTCs which can then be analyzed by cytomorphology, cell culture or molecular analyses has been developed (Desitter et al., 2011). This platform offers the possibility of examining all types of CTCs in a patient's blood sample and does not select a priori for sub-types."

                                "Telomeres are the ends of chromosomes. Functional telomeres prevent chromosomal fusions due to the presence of a protein complex, termed shelterin (de Lange, 2005). If any of the shelterin proteins are down-regulated or absent from the telomere, the complex is no longer protective, and affected telomeres become \u2018reactive\u2019 with other telomeres, and thus gain the ability to perform illegitimate fusion and/or recombination. Such telomeres become \u2018dysfunctional\u2019.",
                                "Telomere dysfunction is typical of cancer cells. When speaking of telomere dysfunction, one refers to critically shortened telomeres and/or to telomeres that lost their protective protein cap irrespective of their actual length (\u201cuncapped\u201d telomeres). When telomeres become dysfunctional, cells can become senescent, enter crisis or begin breakage-bridge-fusion cycles that initiate ongoing genomic instability (Misri et al., 2008; Deng et al, 2008: Lansdorp, 2009). Many cancer cells display chromosomal aberrations that are the direct result of telomere dysfunction. Examples include osteosarcoma (Selvarajah et al., 2006), prostate cancer (Vukovic et al., 2007; Vukovic et al., 2003), breast cancer (Meeker et al., 2004), and colon cancer (Stewenius et al., 2005; for reviews see, DePinho and Polyak, 2004; Lansdorp, 2009; Murnane and Sabatier, 2004).",

Four criteria define this difference; 1) nuclear telomere distribution, 2) the presence/absence of telomere aggregate(s), 3) telomere numbers per cell, and 4) telomere sizes (Mai, 2010).",
                                "To quantify the 3D nuclear organization of telomeres and to measure the above criteria defining the 3D nuclear organization, a semi-automated program, TeloView\u2122 has been developed (Vermolen et al., 2005; Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2009). Methods and systems for determining the 3D organization of telomeres are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,801,682, issued Sep. 21, 2010 titled Method of Monitoring Genomic Instability Using 3D Microscopy and Analysis, which is incorporated herein by reference which is hereby incorporated entirety by reference. An automated version of TeloView\u2122 designated TeloScan\u2122 has also been developed which allows for high throughput analysis (Gadji et al., 2010; Klewes et al., 2011).",
                                "The ability to analyze the 3D nuclear organization of CTC cells is highly desirable. However, the question remains whether the physical handling of CTCs required in methods for the isolation of these rare cells leaves the nuclear structure of the CTC cells intact such that the three-dimensional nuclear organization of the telomeres of the CTC cells can be analysed. Indeed, sampling handling (for example, freezing) is known to alter the nuclear organization of cells.",
                                "A need remains for a robust and sensitive method for determining the 3D nuclear organization of CTC cells to obtain a telomeric signature of CTC subpopulations that can be used for example to correlate with clinical disease progression."

The differences in telomeric organization between the sample and the control can be measured and compared using individual cells or average values from a population of cells. For example, if any telomere in the test cell is larger (i.e. forms more aggregates), for example double the size, of those in the control cell, then this indicates the presence of genomic instability in the test cell. The telomeres in a test cell may also be fragmented and therefore appear smaller than those in the control cell. Accordingly, a change or difference in telomeric organization in the test cell compared to the control cell and/or between subpopulations can be determined by comparing parameters used to characterize the organization of telomeres. Such parameters are determined or obtained for example, using a system and/or method described herein below.",

It includes for example, values for one or more of the following features; telomere numbers, telomere intensities (sizes), overall telomere distribution, telomere aggregates, nuclear volumes. For example the features that define differences in telomere signatures include 1) nuclear telomere distribution, 2) the presence/absence of telomere aggregate(s) (telomere aggregates are telomeres found in clusters that at an optical resolution limit of 200 nm cannot be further resolved and which are not seen in normal cells), 3) telomere numbers per cell, and 4) telomere sizes. Additional criteria include a/c ratios (a/c ratios define the nuclear positions of telomeres). The a/c ratios are characteristic for specific cell cycle phases and nuclear volumes. Feature values for a sample can be calculated and include for example percentage of cells with telomeric aggregates, average number of telomeric aggregates per cell, average number of telomeres per cell, and/or average nuclear volume. Sample values allow for example comparison to other samples.",

                                "An aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is characterized for example by a telomere number at 630\u00d7 magnification in CTC cells of greater than about 10, greater than about 25, greater than about 30, greater than about 35, greater than about 40, greater than about 45, or greater than 50. The aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is characterized for example by decreased mean telomere intensity in CTC cells originating from an aggressive cancer compared to CTCs originating from a non-aggressive cancer. The aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is also characterized for example by an increased percentage of very short telomeres in CTC cells originating from an aggressive cancer compared to CTCs originating from a non-aggressive cancer. For example, an aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is characterized by greater than 60%, greater than 65%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, or greater than 80% very short telomeres in CTC cells. For example, telomeres with a relative fluorescent intensity x-axis) ranging from 0-5,000 units can be classified as very short, with an intensity ranging from 5,000-15,000 units can be classified as short, with an intensity from 15,000-30,000 units can be classified as mid-sized, and with an intensity >30,000 units as large (18). The units are arbitrary units (e.g. a.u). As demonstrated herein, for example in Table 2 and the FIGs, sub-populations can comprise differing size classifications. The telomere aggregates at 630\u00d7 magnification is also increased compared to the non-aggressive cancer telomeres organization signature, for example greater than 2.5, greater than 3, greater than 3.5, greater than 4, greater than 4.5, greater than 5, greater than 5.5 or greater than 6 in CTC cells (e.g. per cell) and greater than 2.5, greater than 3, greater than 3.5 or greater than 4 in CTC cells per unit volume. A non-aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is characterized for example by a telomere number at 630\u00d7 magnification in CTCs of less than about 30, less than about 25, less than about 20, less than about 15, or less than about 10. The non-aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is characterized for example by increased mean telomere intensity in CTCs originating from a non-aggressive form of cancer, compared to CTCs originating from a more aggressive form of cancer. The non-aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is also characterized for example by a decreased percentage of very short telomeres in CTC cells compared to the aggressive cancer telomeres organization signature. For example, the non-aggressive cancer telomere organization signature is characterized by having less than about 70%, less than about 65%, less than about 60%, less than about 50% very short telomeres in CTC cells. The telomere aggregates (630\u00d7 magnification) is also less, for example less than 4, less than 3.5, or less than 3, less than 2.5, less than 2, less than 1.5, less than 1, less than 0.5 in CTC cells per unit volume (or per cell).",

The ScreenCell filter device is shown to allow for example an average recovery of about 91.2% (assessed by spiking 5 cells in a 1 mL of blood). Cells spiked into whole blood and isolated using the ScreenCell device can by lysed and RNA can be extracted directly from cells on the filter. As shown in Desitter et al, the SreenCell Cyto device allows isolation of CTCs from peripheral blood of a patient for example with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Micro emboli can also be isolated from blood for example of a patient with melanoma or colon cancer",
                                "The cells captured on the filter were 3D fixed (Louis et al., 2005). The 3D nuclear organization of the telomeres within the nuclei of captured cells was analyzed as follows: 3D quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) was performed as published (Louis et al., 2005) using a Cy3-labelled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe (DAKO). The nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). 5 \u03bcm sections of paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies were deparaffinized using xylene and then rehydrated and analyzed for 3D nuclear telomere organization.",

For TeloView\u2122 analysis (Vermolen et al., 2005; Gonzalez-Suarez, 2009), imaging of nuclei was performed by using Zeiss AxioImager Z2 with a cooled AxioCam HR B&W, DAPI, Cy3 filters in combination with a Planapo 63x/1.4 oil objective lens. Images were acquired by using AXIOVISION 4.8 (Zeiss) in multichannel mode followed by constrained iterative deconvolution (Schaefer et al., 2001). For every fluorochrome, image stacks were acquired with a sampling distance of 200 nm along the z and 107 nm in the xy direction. TeloScan, the automated version of TeloView, was performed on a scanning platform, the SpotScan system (Applied Spectral Imaging, Migdal HaEmek, Israel). The system uses an automated Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, Pa.) equipped with filters for DAPI and Cy3. Using images of 13 focal planes 0.7 \u03bcm apart, TeloScan was used to scan in telomeres in 3D and store all 3D datasets (Klewes et al., 2011).",

This isolation is done by size with the aid of a microporous membrane filter; therefore, expression levels and/or absence of cell surface antigens play no role in the separation. The 19-cm-long device consists of a filtration tank, a filter, and a detachable nozzle attached to it. This nozzle guides the insertion of a collection EDTA tube to it to gently vacuum suction the blood through the filter membrane leaving the CTCs on the membrane (Desitter et al., 2011). The 18-\u03bcm-thick polycarbonate membrane has circular pores (7.5\u00b10.36 \u03bcm) that are randomly distributed throughout the filter (1\u00d7105 pores/cm2) (Desitter et al., 2011). The filtration process is quick (2-3 minutes), and it was determined herein that it preserves both the CTC morphology permitting assessment by 3D telomere assessment by for example Teloview and/or Teloscan and preserves microclusters/microemboli (which are also subjected to Teloview (FIG. 1.7, B-E). The filtration method was validated with spiked tumor cells; when two and five spiked cells per 1 ml of blood were used, the average number of cells recovered were 1.48 (SD, 0.71) and 4.56 (SD, 0.71), respectively (Desitter et al., 2011).",

In brief, the cells on the filters are incubated in 3.7% formaldehyde/1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline for 10 minutes followed by a 10-minute treatment with 50 \u03bcg/ml pepsin in 0.01 N HCl. The CTCs are postfixed to the filters with 3.7% formaldehyde/1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline for 10 minutes before 8 \u03bcl of Cyanine 3 (Cy3)-labeled peptide nucleic acid probe purchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark) is applied to them. The coverslipped and rubber cement-sealed filters on slides then undergo a 3-minute denaturation at 80\u00b0 C. followed by a 2-hour hybridization at 30\u00b0 C. The filters containing CTCs are washed twice 15 minutes each in 70% formamide/10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), subjected to a 5-minute wash in 0.1\u00d7SSC at 55\u00b0 C., then washed twice 5 minutes each in 2\u00d7SSC/0.05% Tween 20. Finally, the nuclei are stained with 50 \u03bcl of 0.1 \u03bcg/ml 4\u2032,6-diamindino-2 phenylindole (DAPI), dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, and coverslipped with Vectashield\u00ae (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, Ontario) reagent ready for imaging.",

The microscope is equipped with a Cy3 filter for detection of peptide nucleic acid probe-hybridized telomeres and a DAPI filter for nuclear DNA detection with AXIOVISION 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss). The Zeiss AxioImager Z2 was programmed to take 80 stacks of images at x and y=102 nm and z=200 nm to capture the different planes of the CTCs that are observed beside the pores or slightly in the pores. The same acquisition time was used to acquire Cy3 images of telomeres from each tumor type for quantitative comparison and analysis. The acquisition times used in milliseconds were given as follows: melanoma, 1290; colon cancer, 212; breast cancer, 212; prostate cancer, 546; lung cancer cell line, 173.6. Thirty interphase nuclei were imaged for analysis; deconvolution of the images was performed with a constrained iterative algorithm (Schaefer et al., 2001). The reconstructed 3D images were then exported as .tiff files into the TeloView\u2122 program for analysis (Schaefer et al., 2001).",

CTCs of prostate, colon, breast, melanoma, and nuclei of a cultured lung cancer cell line were analyzed and at least two distinguishable subpopulation patterns were seen in each patient sample in all of the tumor types (FIGS. 2 and 3).",
                                "The telomeres of five different tumor types were analyzed using TeloView\u2122 which measures the number and size of telomeres and also identifies the presence of TAs (Vermolen et al, 2005; Knecht et al., 2009). Table 2 shows the different parameters computed by the TeloView\u2122 program such as PCA, ANTC, ANAC, and ANV. With these data, the degree of telomere dysfunction can be assessed, thus giving insight into the level of CIN for each patient. The measurements offer the chance for earlier tumor detection and better cancer classification. Table 2 shows CTC nuclei of patient samples MB0189PR, MB0216PR, MB0222PR, COLON GUI3F, and BR MERT10AA5083PR and nuclei of H2030 lung cancer cell line with percentage of cells with TAs greater than 80%, patients MB0213PR, MB0217PR, COLON GUI5F, BR MIC10AA3956, BR WUR10AA2499, and BR MIC10AA3934 between 60% and 80%, and the remaining MB0211PR, MB0181PR, MB0182PR, COLONGUI2F, MelaGOD10AA4991, Mela CAR10AA2213, Mela SAU 10AA2408, Mela ROB10AA2521, Mela GAU10AA3836, and Mela CHAN10AA4280 less than 60%. Other important parameters that vary among the samples are the ANTC and the ANAC. Both the ANTC and ANAC have corresponding variations among the samples (Table 2). These data obtained from TeloView\u2122 can be used to predict the complexity of genomic instability of the tumors. The TeloView\u2122 analysis of CTCs of these five cancer types was done without prior knowledge of the patients' clinical data. The deductions and classifications resulting from the TeloView\u2122 analysis was then compared with the clinical data obtained (Table 1).",

                                "The distinct 3D nuclear architecture of the CTCs was visualized through the DAPI filter before image acquisition. The captured CTCs were found either as solitary or clustered cells scattered around and sometimes slightly within the pores (FIG. 1.7). In animals, the importance of CTC clusters and tumor-lymphocyte mixed clusters as prognostic factors in metastasis process has been mentioned (Molnar et al, 2001; Glaves D., 1984). The CTCs are often irregularly shaped (FIGS. 1 and 2) and larger than other blood cells enabling their isolation due to their inability to pass through the filters' pores (7.5\u00b10.36 \u03bcm) (Desitter et al, 2011); for example, the prostate cancer cell size ranges between 15 and 25 \u03bcm (Zheng et al, 2007). FIG. 1.7A shows hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained prostate cancer CTCs (pointed out by arrows) captured by the filter device. These CTCs are clearly two and three times larger than the pores. The identities of the cells were confirmed by pathologic examination. CTCs sometimes display chromatin condensation, unlike most of the lymphocytes. Solitary lymphocytes mostly pass through the pores of the filter except in some instances where they are found in between pores. Lymphocytes sometimes also form lymphocyte-lymphocyte clusters or lymphocyte-CTC clusters that cannot go through the pores.",

Both the density of the CTCs captured from 3 ml of each sample and the frequency of the clusters observed can give a preliminary insight to the status of the disease at the point when the sample was collected (Budd et al., 2006). FIG. 1.7 B-E, shows the isolation and preservation of CTC clusters in the filtered patients' blood.",
                                "At \u00d760 oil magnification, the varying sizes of the CTCs were observed with associated different chromatin condensation seen. Further analysis using TeloView\u2122 measures the nuclear volume and this distinguishes CTCs from captured clumped lymphocytes that are smaller in size individually (Table 2). A switch to the Cy3 filter shows the hybridized telomere signals with varying signal intensity and numbers that give the first suggestion of different subpopulations within CTCs of the same patient's filtered blood.",

                                "Cancer cells commonly exhibit an altered telomere number per cell nucleus with the telomeres often being shorter than those in normal cells. These alterations from the normal cell telomeres have been attributed to aneuploidy and genomic instability (Meeker et al., 2004).",
                                "Cy3-stained telomeres were analyzed and their signal intensities evaluated by TeloView\u2122. The telomere signal intensity of a CTC nucleus is dependent on the number of TAs present in that CTC. This can be projected for the whole sample by calculating the PCA and the ANAC (Table 2). The program also calculates the ANTC in each nucleus. The variation in ANTC in the same sample may be an indication of the presence of CTC subpopulation and level of tumor aggressiveness (Mai et al., 2006; Gadji et al., 2010; Gadji et al., 2012). In FIGS. 2 to 3, different subpopulations of CTCs in the same patient are shown. The subpopulations of CTCs are identified on the basis of the differences in their telomere intensities, which can be due to varying number of telomeres, size of telomeres, or presence/absence of TAs. TAs are commonly seen in tumor cells (Mai et al., 2005; Mai et al, 2006) (FIGS. 2 Af, and Cf-Ef show prominent TAs) and their analyses has been shown to be useful in tumor characterization (Chuang et al., 2004; Mai et al., 2006).",
                                "FIG. 2 shows representative 2D and 3D images of isolated CTCs. The FIG. represents different subpopulations of CTCs present in the same prostate cancer patient (MB0181PR). In FIG. 2 the nuclear DNA is stained with DAPI (diffuse grey) and telomeres (bright dots), which are within the nuclei, are Cy3 stained. Images in FIG. 2 Aa and Ab, are of a cell that represents the subpopulation with low telomere intensity in this prostate cancer patient evident by the scanty number of signals observed. The two other CTC subpopulations represented in the same prostate cancer patient are the medium (FIGS. 2 Ac and Ad) and high (FIGS. 2 Ae and Af) telomere intensity CTCs. A similar classification is shown in the colon cancer patient GUI3F (FIG. 2B) with increasing numbers of telomeres seen along the classes of CTCs but a higher than normal number of telomeres observed in CTCs that belong to the high intensity subpopulation (FIGS. 2, Be and Bf). This irregularly high number of telomeres seen is one of the features of cancer cells that result from CIN (Mai et al, 2006). FIG. 2C shows 2D and 3D images of cells representing subpopulations in a breast cancer patient: BR MIC10AA3934, with low (FIGS. 2 Ca and Cb), medium (FIGS. 2 Cc and Cd), and high (FIGS. 2 Ce and Cf) intensity telomere signals. FIG. 2D shows subpopulations in a melanoma patient: Melanoma CAR10AA2213, which is similar to subpopulations in breast cancer patient (BR MIC10AA3934) (FIG. 2C) except for the presence of more TAs (FIG. 2Df) in the melanoma patient. The lung cancer subpopulations in cell line H2030 are shown in FIG. 2E. It was noted that this lung cancer cell line generally has high telomere numbers, but their telomere sizes vary. The telomere size was used to group the CTCs into subpopulations (FIG. 2E).",
                                "From the results shown in FIG. 2 it is clear that different subpopulations of CTCs are present in the same cancer patients and that these subpopulations can be identified by TeloView\u2122 analysis. In the same tumor type, the variations in telomere intensities in addition to the presence and frequency of TAs can with larger patient cohorts, permit the classification of cancer into stages of progression and aggressiveness with the prospects of improving cancer management.",

The signals with the same intensity fall on the same spot on the graph and this gives a picture of the distribution of CTC subpopulations within each patient's filtered blood. For normal cells, this plot usually has a single peak, which ranges between 40 and 60 telomeres per nucleus on the y-axis (de Vos et al., 2005). A direct comparison of prostate cancer CTCs and lymphocytes from the same patient (MB0239PR) is shown in FIG. 4. Not only are the numbers of telomeres detected different between CTCs and lymphocytes of the same patient but also did we measure a size difference between the two cell types with average sizes of CTC nuclei being more than three-fold larger than those of the lymphocytes of the same patient, captured on the same filter (FIG. 4).",
                                "CTCs of all patients give 3D telomeric profiles with either a very high number or very low number of telomeres (FIG. 3, A-E). FIG. 3 shows plots of the different representative CTCs' telomere numbers against their intensities. Many deviations from the 3D telomere profiles of normal cells (Chuang et al., 2004; de Vos et al., 2009; Vermolen et al., 2005) (FIG. 4) were observed; the striking regular finding in the graphs from these CTCs is the presence of multiple peaks, which represent different subpopulations in the samples. The plots revealed the different subpopulations of CTCs in the same patient shown by the vertical line demarcations in the graphs. The subpopulations can be identified according to their signal intensities, i.e., low, medium, and high intensities (FIG. 3, A-E). FIG. 3A is a plot of a prostate patient's signal intensity against number of telomeres, the telomere numbers peak at 18 (below the normal range (Chuang et al., 2004; de Vos et al., 2009; Vermolen et al., 2005)), and there are three populations identified by line demarcations on the plot, i.e., low, medium, and high intensity groups (FIG. 3 A-E). The plot for GUI3F (Colon CA) in FIG. 3B is a sharp contrast to FIG. 3A with telomere numbers having a peak at 110 (FIG. 3B). There is disparity in different cancer types that can be studied further with larger cohorts of the same cancer type. Although the plot for BR MIC10AA3934 (FIG. 3C) has a telomere number peak of 45, it has multiple peaks that signify the different subpopulations present in the same patient (FIG. 3C). The zigzag nature of the plot for melanoma gives it a peculiar pattern (FIG. 3D); it also has its highest telomere number peak at 19 (below the normal range). Three distinct subpopulations of telomere intensities can be identified in this plot (FIG. 3D). The plot for lung cancer cell line depicts its high telomere number with a peak of telomere numbers at 290, most of which are short telomeres as earlier shown in 3D images (FIG. 2D, images b and d).",

Although they all exhibit the presence of subpopulations of CTCs in the same patient sample, the telomeres of these cancer cells may tend to have similar features in each tumor type. The prostate, melanoma, and breast cancer CTCs may tend to form high numbers of TAs (FIGS. 2 Af, Df and Cf). The colon cancer CTCs and lung cancer cell line may tend to have significantly increased numbers of telomeres (FIGS. 2 Bf and Ef). The peculiarities seen in telomeres of different tumor types are also exhibited in the plots of their telomere numbers against telomere intensities (FIG. 3 A-E). The architectural alterations seen in the telomeres seem to be specific to each cancer type.",

                                "Three milliliters of blood per patient captures CTCs present in this volume of blood and allows for the detection of those CTCs that are present in that sample. Duplicate and triplicate samples taken at the same time and from the same patient will result in the isolation of varying numbers of CTCs due to their rare presence per milliliter blood. This will also impact on the frequencies of individual subpopulations detected. We can therefore only conclude that CTC subpopulations are present, but the frequency of each population may vary in small sample volumes. Two example are provided here to illustrate this point. Patient GUI with colon cancer had three 3-ml blood samples examined (2F, 3F, and 5F) and their 3D nuclear architecture analyzed. 2F, 3F, and 5F have telomeres with low intensity at 58.16%, 54.34%, and 64.42%, respectively; medium intensity telomeres were found at 38.27%, 36.82%, and 33.85%, respectively, and high intensity telomeres had frequencies of 3.57%, 6.99%, and 1.73%, respectively (Table 2). This is a fairly consistent representation of the telomere intensity subpopulations in three different samples of the patient GUI.",
                                "A different example is represented by the breast cancer patient MIC. Two different samples (10AA3956 and 10AA3934) were obtained at the same time from the patient, and the 3D nuclear analysis of the CTCs revealed the presence of three different telomere subpopulations. 10AA3956 and 10AA3934 had percentages of telomeres with low intensity of 77.36 and 35.38, medium intensity of 20.22 and 62.01, and then high intensity of 2.42 and 2.61, respectively (Table 2). The frequency of each population is more variable (except in the high telomere intensity group) than it was in patient GUI. Therefore, the average of multiple samples obtained at the same time will only provide confirmation of the presence of distinct CTC subpopulations in a patient but will not give an absolute distribution frequency.",
                                "The numbers of CTCs isolated are predictive and can be quantitated, but as the sample size is small, the numbers are not absolute numbers of CTCs for a patient.",

These circulating tumor microemboli can lead to clogging of small blood vessels, thus causing anemia in the region supplied by the affected vessels (Kane et al., 1975). This can result in increased morbidity and could be included as a prognosticator that could enhance the classification and management of cancer patients."
