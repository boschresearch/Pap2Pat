                "[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4813837] Solid-state white lighting has gained interest since the development of candela-class, high brightness (In,Ga)N light emitting diodes (LEDs) by Nakamura and coworkers in 1995. 1 This development, in combination with appropriate phosphor compositions and improvements in device packaging, have led to devices that use less energy and are a viable option to replace conventional incandescent or fluorescent light sources. 2 Traditional solid-state white lighting devices comprise a blue or near-UV LED as the excitation source and one or more phosphor compositions which down-convert all or part of the LED emission to longer wavelengths. [2][3][4] The LEDs used in these devices currently suffer a loss in external quantum efficiency (EQE) as operating current increases, known as droop. As LED efficiency decreases with higher operating currents, the result is an increase in the temperature of the device, since this efficiency is lost as heat. The increased temperature will in turn cause more efficiency loss from the LED and may lead to a shift in the peak emission wavelength and broadening of the emission spectrum. The increased temperature of the device will also affect the phosphor, causing a decrease in efficiency and a possible shift in the peak emission wavelength of the phosphor. These changes in the spectrum of the LED and phosphor will change the ratio of light emitted by each component, resulting in a shift in the color point of the white light, and a decrease in overall device efficiency, making high-power devices difficult to achieve using single LEDs as the excitation source. 5,6 In contrast to LEDs, laser diodes do not exhibit this efficiency loss. The output power and EQE of laser diodes increase linearly with current, and maintains color stability of the laser emission, making laser diodes an attractive excitation source for new high-power white lighting applications. 7 Additionally, since the shift in the color coordinates of a device under increased operating current is largely due to the increased temperature of the device, a remote phosphor geometry is extremely important to eliminate thermal effects. Remote phosphors can easily employed with a laser diode, since the phosphor may be placed at a distance far from the laser source. Also, laser-based device may be operated in reflection mode, allowing for the remote a kdenault@mrl.ucsb.edu phosphor to be placed on a reflective substrate that may also act as a heat sink to effectively dissipate heat away from the phosphor.",
                "Previous work has shown that white light emission can be achieved by exciting a phosphor with a laser diode, while maintaining color stability with increasing injection current. Xu et al. reported white light emission of 5.7 lm with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5225 K and efficacy of 13 lm/W when exciting yellow-and blue-emitting phosphors with a near-UV laser diode. 7 In 2009, the same group reported emission of white light of 3.6 lm with a CCT of 5393 K and efficacy of 8.3 lm/W using a near-UV laser diode to excite red-, green-, and blue-emitting phosphors. 8 Ryu and Kim reported emission of white light by exciting a yellow-emitting phosphor with a blue laser diode, achieving 5 lm with an efficacy of 10 lm/W. 9 The luminous flux and efficacy of such devices must reach higher values for high-power, high-brightness applications. Since these reports have been published, laser diode technologies have improved and are continuing to do so. In this letter, we demonstrate that with current commercially available laser diodes and the appropriate mix of phosphors, high-power, efficient white light generation is achievable with good color rendition and in a variety of color temperatures. The quality of the white light is analyzed for three devices, two using a near-UV (\u03bb max = 402 nm) laser diode in combination with red-, green-, and blue-emitting (RGB) phosphors of differing RGB concentrations and the third using a blue (\u03bb max = 442 nm) laser diode in combination with yellow-emitting Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce 3 + (YAG:Ce). We also perform optimization of such a device based on an estimation of maximum efficacy.",
                "The proprietary RGB phosphors used in this study were obtained from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. They were chosen based on high absorption of near-UV (\u03bb = 402 nm) light and a combination of emissions that represent most of the visible spectrum. Phosphor samples were prepared by mixing 50 wt% phosphor powder with silicone resin (GE Silicones, RTV-615), molded in the shape of a disk, mounted on a quartz substrate (Chemglass), and cured at 150 \u2022 C for 15 min. Photoluminescence spectra were collected using a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer equipped with a xenon lamp. Figure 1 shows the excitation and emission spectra for the red-, green-, and blueemitting phosphors chosen and their relative emission intensities, used to determine the necessary concentrations of each. It should be noted that due to the broad excitation spectrum of the red-emitting phosphor, some emission from the blue-emitting phosphor is absorbed and a higher concentration of blue-emitting phosphor is needed. Two RGB ratios were chosen to demonstrate the variety of color temperatures possible using a laser-based white light source. Phosphor sample RGB 1 consists of a R:G:B weight ratio of 1.65 : 1 : 3.45 and phosphor sample RGB 2 consists of a R:G:B weight ratio of 3.3 : 1 : 2.3.",
                "Spectral power distribution (SPD), Commission Internationale de l' \u00c9clairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates, and color rendering indices (R a ) were collected using an integrating sphere with the laser mounted in a side port and the phosphor sample mounted in the center of the sphere. The sample surface was positioned at a slight angle from the incoming laser beam to prevent reflection back towards the laser port. Schematic illustrations of the experimental setup are depicted in Figure 2. Commercially available laser diodes were used including a near-UV laser diode with \u03bb max = 402 nm, FWHM = 2.6 nm, threshold current of 30 mA, and wall plug efficiency (WPE) of 20% and a blue laser diode with \u03bb max = 442 nm, FWHM = 2.7 nm, threshold current of 150 mA, and WPE of 30%.",
                "Operating the near-UV laser diode at 450 mA, corresponding to peak efficiency, we obtain white light with high color rendering at a variety of color temperatures by modifying the RGB phosphor ratios. The SPD and CIE chromaticity coordinates are shown in Figure 3. The measured values are listed in Table I. These devices show excellent color temperature and color rendering capabilities. The luminous flux produced is comparable to current commercially available bright white LEDs of similar color temperatures. The luminous efficacies of these laser-based devices are relatively low due to the low wall plug efficiency of the laser diodes. With additional improvements in laser diode technologies, the luminous efficacy and flux of these white light sources may exceed those of commercial LED competitors. There are several advantages to using a near-UV laser diode for white lighting applications including the variety of color temperatures possible with high color rendering indices and the ability to create eye safe devices. The unconverted near-UV laser light is not contributing to the luminous flux due to the sensitivity of the human eye. The uncoverted laser light can therefore be filtered out from the resulting white light, eliminating any safety concerns due to strong laser light.",
                "A third laser-based device was measured using the blue laser diode in combination with yellowemitting YAG:Ce. Y 2.94 Ce 0.06 Al 5 O 12 was prepared by intimately mixing stoichiometric amounts of Y 2 O 3 (99.99% purity, Materion), Al 2 O 3 (high purity, sub-micron SM8, Baikowski), and CeO 2 (99.9% purity, Materion), with 5 wt% BaF 2 (99% purity, Materion) and 0.5 wt% NH 4 F (99.99% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) which act as a flux, in an agate mortar with acetone for approximately 30 min. Powder was then pressed into pellets, placed on top of sacrificial powder in alumina crucibles, and heated at 1500 \u2022 C for 5 h in flowing 5%H 2 /95%N 2 gas with heating ramps of 2 \u2022 Cmin -1 . The brightness and efficacy of laser-based white lighting devices will depend on the efficiency of the multiple components used, including the laser diode and the combination of phosphors. As stated previously, the ability to produce high-brightness laser-based white lighting devices will increase as laser diode efficiencies improve. In an effort to determine the capabilities of laser-based devices, we have calculated an estimation of maximum efficacy. This calculation was performed for the blue laser diode and YAG:Ce phosphor.",
                "A target white light was chosen with a CCT of 4555 K and R a of 58. The ratio of laser emission to phosphor emission was varied until this target white light was reached. The resulting SPD and CIE chromaticity coordinates are shown in Figure 4(a) and 4(c). The generated SPD was deconvoluted into three Gaussian curves to represent emission from the blue laser diode and emission from the Ce 3 + 5d states ( 2 D 3/2 ) to the 2 F 5/2 and 2 F 7/2 ground states in YAG:Ce. The resulting fraction of integrated laser emission was 0.22 and that of phosphor emission was 0.78. The luminous flux (\u03c6 v ) of the generated white light can be calculated using Equation ( 1) where K m equals 683 lm/W for photopic vision, \u03c6 e is the radiant flux, and V (\u03bb) is the standard luminosity function for photopic vision. Assuming a total integrated power of 1 W for the generated white light, this results in a \u03c6 v of 350 lm for the generated SPD for the target white light. The input power (P input ) used to generate this can be determined by Equation ( 2)",
                "P input = P laser \u03b7 wpe + P phosphor \u03b7 s \u03b7 qy \u03b7 wpe (2)   where P laser is the integrated spectral power of the laser emission in the white light SPD, P phosphor is the integrated spectral power of the phosphor emission, \u03b7 s is the efficiency of the Stokes loss of the phosphor, \u03b7 qy is the photoluminescent quantum yield of the phosphor, and \u03b7 wpe is the wall plug efficiency of the laser diode. Again assuming a total integrated spectral power of 1 W for the generated white light SPD, P laser can be determined from the Gaussian fits to be 0.22 W and P phosphor to be 0.78 W. The \u03b7 s parameter may be estimated by taking the ratio of the maximum laser diode emission wavelength to the maximum phosphor emission wavelength. Using a \u03b7 s of 76% and a \u03b7 qy of 90% for YAG:Ce, and using a \u03b7 wpe of 30% for the blue laser diode, P input is calculated to be 4.5 W. The luminous efficacy (\u03b7 v ) of the theoretical white light is then calculated using Equation ( 3)",
                "The estimated maximum efficacy for a white light with a CCT of 4555 K and R a of 58 generated using a blue laser diode with a wall plug efficiency of 30% and YAG:Ce phosphor is then calculated to be 78 lm/W. The estimation of maximum efficacy allows us to gauge the possible capabilities of future laser-based white light devices. If the wall plug efficiency of a blue laser diode reaches 75%, we would expect the efficacy of a device using YAG:Ce to increase to almost 200 lm/W. Similar estimates may also be conducted for devices comprising multiple phosphor compositions or different laser diode wavelengths.",
                "The blue laser diode was then operated at 750 mA, corresponding to peak efficiency, and the ratio of laser emission to phosphor emission was varied to obtain results closest to those described in the estimated calculation. The measured SPD and CIE chromaticity coordiantes are shown in Figure 4(b) and 4(c) with deconvolution into three Gaussian curves to represent the emission from the laser and phosphor components. The measured fraction of integrated laser emission is 0.21 and that of phosphor emission is 0.79, similiar to the calculated spectrum. The properties of the resulting white light are summarized in Table I. The measured luminous efficacy agrees well with the estimated luminous efficacy for such a device. We again see the luminous flux produced is comparable to current commercially available bright white LEDs of similar color temperatures. The luminous efficacy of this device is higher than that of devices using the near-UV laser diode, yet this results in a cool white light with low color rendition. This is also a common problem encountered in LED-based devices using only YAG:Ce as the conversion phosphor, due to the lack of a red component in YAG:Ce. In the case of laser excitation, the low color rendering can also be attributed to the narrow width of the laser spectrum, resulting in only a narrow range of blue wavelengths represented in the white light.",
                "In conclusion, white light generation using a laser diode in combination with inorganic phosphors is a viable option for high-brightness, high-power white lighting applications. Using a near-UV laser diode in combination with RGB phosphors offers the ability to produce a wide range of color temperatures with high color rendering indices. We have achieved white light with a CCT of 3600 K, R a of 91, luminous flux 47 lm, and luminous efficacy of 16 lm/W, along with a warm white light with a CCT of 2700 K, R a of 95, luminous flux of 53 lm, and luminous efficacy of 19 lm/W. We have also achieved white light using a blue laser diode in combination with yellow-emitting YAG:Ce which results in a CCT of 4400 K, R a of 57, luminous flux of 252 lm, and luminous efficacy of 76 lm/W. We have also shown that the luminous efficacy of such a device can be improved by estimating the maximum efficacy and altering the ratio of laser emission to phosphor emission in order to reach this maximum efficacy. Further improvements in these devices can be envisioned through advancements in laser diode technologies and optimization of device packaging and phosphor properties."
