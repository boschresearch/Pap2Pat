                        "Prior solid-state white lighting devices typically use a light emitting diode (LED) combined with one or more phosphors to convert a portion of the LED spectrum to other wavelengths in the visible region, the combination of which appears as white light. These devices already offer many advantages over traditional incandescent and fluorescent light sources, including long lifetimes, environmentally friendly designs without the need for mercury, and enormous energy savings.",
                        "Yet, the overall efficiency of these devices can still be improved. One such example is to control the operating temperature of the device. When operating an LED, the temperature will inevitably increase, yet the phosphor particles exhibit a loss in efficiency as the temperature of the device increases. In addition, LEDs suffer from efficiency loss and color instability with increased operating current, making high-power devices not achievable using LEDs as the excitation source.",
                        "In contrast to LEDs, laser diodes do not exhibit this efficiency loss, many exhibit increased efficiency as current increases, and maintain color stability. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved solid-state white lighting devices that rely on laser diodes. The present invention satisfies this need."

                        "To overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention discloses a high-power, laser-driven, white light source using one or more phosphors. The result is a highly efficient and stable solid-state white lighting device that can be used for high-power applications. It features a near-ultraviolet (UV) or blue laser diode as the excitation light source and one or more phosphors deposited onto a thermally conductive substrate, that can be transparent or reflective, and placed at a remote distance from the laser source. White light is created through the combination of the near-UV or blue light emitted from the laser diode and the down-converted blue, green, yellow or red light emitted from the phosphor. In different embodiments of the art, the radiation from the laser may or may not be combined with the radiation from the phosphor or phosphors. For example, even when a blue laser diode is used, it may be advantageous to employ a blue phosphor, excited by the radiation from the laser, in order to broaden the spectral characteristics of the output light in the blue region of visible wavelengths.",
                        "Using a laser diode allows for the realization of a high power solid state white lighting device with stable color properties and no loss in efficiency at high operating currents. Phosphor particles deposited onto a thermally conductive substrate allow for dissipation of heat away from the phosphor and device, again eliminating the loss in efficiency due to increased temperature of the phosphor when operating the device. The remote phosphor geometry in conjunction with a high power laser exhibits improved efficiencies and allow these solid-state white lighting devices to be used in new applications."

The substrate is also thermally conductive, allowing for easy dissipation of heat away from the device, eliminating efficiency loss due to increased operating temperatures.",
                                "Laser-based devices also offer easy servicing of parts. The use of lasers with a remote phosphor configuration allows the laser to be placed at a relatively far distance from the phosphor, as would be useful in the case of street lights or stadium lighting. Lasers on the ground level, which excite phosphors placed at the point that is to be illuminated, can then easily be serviced when necessary.",
                                "An advantageous embodiment of the invention can include one or more optical elements, including appropriate refractive optics, and/or optical Bragg diffraction using gratings, so that the laser source radiation can be efficiently spread out over the phosphors, rather than be confined to a sharp point of excitation. Moreover, the surface of the phosphor coating or monolith may be shaped, patterned or roughened, in order to achieve appropriate light insertion and extraction.",
