    "abstract": "High plasma lipid levels have been demonstrated to increase cardiovascular disease risk. Despite advances in treatments to decrease plasma lipids, additional therapeutics are still needed because many people are intolerant or nonresponsive to these therapies. We previously showed that increasing cellular levels of microRNA-30c (miR-30c) using viral vectors or liposomes reduces plasma lipids and atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to synthesize potent miR-30c analogs that can be delivered to hepatoma cells without the aid of viral vectors and lipid emulsions. We hypothesized that modification of the passenger strand of miR-30c would increase the stability of miR-30c and augment its delivery to liver cells. Here, we report the successful synthesis of a series of miR-30c analogs by using different chemically modified nucleosides. In these analogs, we left the active sense strand untouched so that its biological activity remained unaltered, and we modified the passenger strand of miR-30c to enhance the stability and uptake of miR-30c by hepatoma cells through phosphorothiorate linkages and the addition of GalNAc. We show that these analogs significantly reduced apolipoprotein B secretion in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells and human primary hepatocytes without affecting apolipoprotein A1 secretion and cellular lipid levels. Our results provide a proof of concept that the passenger strand of miR-30c can be modified to increase its stability and delivery to cells while retaining the potency of the sense strand. We anticipate these miR-30c analogs will be useful in the development of more efficacious analogs for the treatment of hyperlipidemias and cardiovascular diseases.",

                        "RNA interference\u2013based therapy is becoming a feasible and attractive approach for treating life-threatening diseases that are not easily treatable through conventional small drug molecules. The success of siRNA-based therapy has been due to improvements in the stability, potency, specificity, delivery, and safety of modified siRNAs (30, 31, 32). Building on prior advances made in siRNA delivery technology, we synthesized novel analogs of miR-30c to assess whether these approaches might be extended to miRs. Strategically, we decided to modify only the antisense strand (passenger strands, miR-30c-1-3p and miR-30c-2-3p) while leaving the active sense strand (guide strand, miR-30c-5p) untouched to avoid hindering its ability to interact with the RNA-induced silencing complex and recognition of target mRNAs. As shown in Figure\u00a01, A and B, two versions of double-stranded mature miR-30c sequences (miR-30c-1 and miR-30c-2) are derived from the products of two independent genes, MIRC1 and MIRC2, and contain an identical guide strand (sense strand, miR-30c-5p, 5\u2032-UGU AAACAUCCUACACUCUCAGC-3\u2032) but slightly different passenger strands (antisense strands, red, miR-30c-1-3p, 5\u2032-CUGGGAGAGGGUUGUUUACUCC-3\u2032 and miR-30c-2-3p, black, 5\u2032-CUGGGAGAAGGCUGUUUACUCU-3\u2032). First, we synthesized modified miR-30c-1-3p and miR-30c-2-3p passenger strands by using all 2\u2032-O-methyl (2\u2032-OMe) nucleosides (Fig.\u00a01C), then annealed these antisense strands with a sense unmodified or native miR-30c-5p strand to study the biophysical properties of the annealed duplexes. For a control, we annealed unmodified miR-30c-1-3p with native miR-30c-5p. Duplexes of miR-30c-5p with native miR-30c-3p, modified miR-30c-1-3p, or modified miR-30c-2-3p showed similar denaturation curves (Fig.\u00a02A). However, the overall thermal stability of duplexes with modified miR-30c-3p strands increased by \u223c7 \u00b0C, thus indicating enhanced stability of the duplexes. The CD spectra showed similar conformations for both native and modified duplexes. These duplexes had a strong positive peak in the range of 260 to 270\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02B). Thus, the annealing of miR-30c antisense strand containing modified base pairs does not affect its interaction with the miR-30c sense strand in duplex formation and the double-helix conformation.Figure\u00a01MiR-30c sequences and several commonly used RNA modifications.A and B, the two double-stranded mature miR-30c sequences derived from two independent genes are shown.

                        "These data indicated that the synthesis of miR-30c-3p with modified nucleotides does not affect either the ability of these modified passenger strands to bind the sense strand or the stability of the dsRNA. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of theses miRs in reducing apoB secretion in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells (Fig.\u00a03) by adding them to the media and analyzing their effects on apoB secretion. The duplexes had no effect on apoB secretion when added to cells without transfection reagent. These negative results might have been because the duplexes failed to be delivered to the cells or were not physiologically active. To determine the reasons for their inactivity, we introduced native miR-30c-5p complexed with 2\u2032-OMe modified miR-30c-1-3p (2\u2032-OMe-30C-1) or miR-30c-2-3p (2\u2032-OMe-30c-2) analogs into cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Both modified complexes significantly reduced apoB secretion (Fig.\u00a03, A and B) without affecting apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a03, C and D), thus indicating that the modified miRs were physiologically active when introduced as lipid complexes. The inability of these complexes to reduce apoB secretion in the absence of lipid-mediated delivery was probably because the RNAs were unable to enter the cells. These data provided crucial preliminary evidence that miR-30c-3p modifications are tolerable if delivered to cells and suggested the feasibility of synthesis of more potent miR-30c analogs by modifying the antisense strands of miR-30c.Figure\u00a03Activity of 2\u2032-OMe modified miR-30c-1 and miR-30c-2 in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells. Huh-7 cells were reverse transfected with 100\u00a0nM of 2\u2032-OMe-modified miR-30c analogs complexed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent at a ratio of 3:1. For the control, cells were treated only with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (no mimics). Forty-eight hours after transfection with 2\u2032-OMe-30c-1 and 2\u2032-OMe-30c-2 analogs, media were collected and used to measure apoB and apoA1 concentrations. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Significance was determined at p\u00a0< 0.05 (\u2217) with two-tailed t test, and error bars represent mean\u00a0\u00b1 SD (A\u2013D). apoA1, apolipoprotein A1; apoB, apolipoprotein B; miR-30c, microRNA-30c.",
                        "Next, we introduced pseudouridine (\u03c8) (Fig.\u00a01C) in place of the natural uracil and synthesized six different series A (A1\u2013A6) strands (Table\u00a01). Pseudouridine stabilizes the tertiary structure of tRNA, and the synthetic replacement of all uracils with pseudouridine renders mRNA nonimmunogenic and increases its stability (33, 34). All analogs were transfected into Huh-7\u00a0cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Fig.\u00a04A). For the positive control, we used commercial native miR-30c. For the negative control, we used an unrelated commercially available miR (Ctrl). Compared with the Ctrl, miR-30c and all A-series analogs significantly decreased apoB secretion (Fig.\u00a04A), but apoA1 secretion was unaffected (Fig.\u00a04B). These studies indicated that when delivered to cells, these new synthetic analogs were able to diminish apoB secretion similarly to miR-30c, as compared with Ctrl miR. Next, we asked whether any of these analogs might affect apoB secretion without lipid emulsions. For this purpose, we provided higher concentrations of analogs to cells without Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent. These analogs and native miR-30c had no effect on apoB and apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a04, C and D). These studies indicated that these analogs were unable to penetrate cells on their own to reduce apoB secretion; however, they were able to reduce apoB secretion when introduced into cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent.Table\u00a01MiR-30c analogs and sequencesCompoundShort formStrandSequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032)CtrlCtrlSenseUCACAACCUCCUAGAAAGAGUAGAmiR30c30cmiR-30c-5pUGUAAACAUCCUACACUCUCAGCmiR30c-A1A1miR-30c-1-3pCugggagaggguuguuuacucCmiR30c-A2A2miR-30c-1-3pC\u03c8gggagaggg\u03c8\u03c8g\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8ac\u03c8cCmiR30c-A3A3miR-30c-1-3pC\u03c8gggAgAggg\u03c8\u03c8g\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8AC\u03c8CCmiR30c-A4A4miR-30c-2-3pCugggagaaggcuguuuacucUmiR30c-A5A5miR-30c-2-3pc\u03c8gggagaaggc\u03c8g\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8ac\u03c8cUmiR30c-A6A6miR-30c-2-3pC\u03c8gggAgAAggC\u03c8g\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8AC\u03c8CUUnderlined upper case letters, native nucleosides; lower case letters, 2\u2032-OMe ribosugar modifications; \u03c8, pseudouridine.Figure\u00a04Effects of different miR-30c series A analogs on apoB secretion in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells.A, apoB secretion in Huh-7\u00a0cells transfected with control (Ctrl) and different miR-30c analogs (100\u00a0nM), as described in Table\u00a01, with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent.

                        "In recent years, the asialoglycoprotein receptor ligand GalNAc has been used to deliver antisense and siRNA oligonucleotides to liver cells (35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41). Therefore, we introduced one GalNAc-modified nucleotide at both ends as well as more than one GalNAc-modified residue in the antisense strands. First, we synthesized 3-chloropropyl GalNAc (Figs.\u00a05A and 2) and 3-azidopropyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-galactopyranoside (GalNAc\u03b1ProN3; Figs.\u00a05A and 3). Their correct synthesis was confirmed by 1H NMR spectra (Fig.\u00a05, B and C) and 15% polyacrylamide analytical 8\u00a0M urea gel electrophoresis (Fig.\u00a05D). Second, the GalNAcProN3 was attached to 2\u2019-(O-propargyl)-cytosine through click chemistry (42, 43). Third, GalNAc-cytidine (pC) was used during the synthesis of miR-30c-3p strands (Table\u00a02). During these syntheses, we also incorporated 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro ribosugar-modified nucleosides to increase the biological stability (44) of these RNA strands (Table\u00a02). Fourth, these analogs were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent. All analogs potently inhibited apoB secretion in Huh-7\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a06A) and therefore were biologically active. apoA1 secretion was unaffected by these analogs (Fig.\u00a06B). Fifth, we evaluated the efficacy of these series B analogs in reducing apoB secretion when provided to cells without Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent. Similarly to miR-30c, compounds B5 and B8 had no effect on apoB secretion with respect to the Ctrl (Fig.\u00a06C). However, all other analogs reduced apoB secretion from 40% to 80%. None of these analogs affected apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a06D). The most potent analogs inhibiting apoB secretion were B1 and B2 (Fig.\u00a06C). Both these analogs contain one copy of GalNAc at either the 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032 end. Introduction of multiple GalNAc-modified nucleotides, as in B5 and B8, resulted in a loss of biological activity. Thus, analogs with one GalNAc at either end are suitable for cellular delivery without liposomes.Figure\u00a05Synthesis of 3-chloropropyl GalNAc 2 and GalNAc\u03b1ProN3\u00a03.A, 3-Chloropropyl GalNAc 2 and GalNAc\u03b1ProN3 3 were synthesized as described in the Experimental procedures section.

                        "Because analogs B1 and B2 potently inhibited apoB secretion, we performed concentration-dependent studies to assess their potency. Both analogs showed a concentration-dependent decrease in apoB secretion with an IC50 of 250\u00a0nM, but miR-30c had no effect (Fig.\u00a07A). Under similar conditions, different concentrations of miR-30c, B1, and B2 had no effect on apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a07B). Next, we exposed cells to 250\u00a0nM of B1 and B2 to assess the delivery of miR-30c to cells and its effects on MTP. The levels of miR-30c compared with control miR-30c transcripts were significantly higher (approximately sevenfold) in the B1-exposed cells and (approximately fivefold) in the B2-exposed cells (Fig.\u00a07C). We previously showed that miR-30c diminishes apoB secretion by reducing MTP activity (23, 24, 25, 28, 29). Therefore, we studied the effects of analogs B1 and B2 on MTP expression. Both analogs B1 and B2, compared with miR-30c, reduced MTP mRNA and activity by more than 50% (Fig.\u00a07, D and E). Western blot analysis also showed a similar decrease in MTP (Fig.\u00a07F). These studies suggest that analogs B1 and B2 are likely to reduce apoB secretion in Huh-7\u00a0cells by lowering MTP expression similarly to native miR-30c.Figure\u00a07Effects of GalNAc-modified B1 and B2 analogs on apoB secretion and MTP activity in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells.

                        "In Figure\u00a07A, a significant reduction in apoB secretion was observed with 250\u00a0nM of analogs B1 and B2. Because our long-term goal is to develop analogs as potential therapeutic drugs, we focused on producing analogs that are more efficacious. Recent studies have suggested that the placement of phosphorothioate linkages improves both the specificity and silencing activity of siRNAs (37, 40). Therefore, we synthesized new series C analogs of compounds B1 and B2 by using phosphorothioate linkages (Table\u00a03). These analogs were transfected into cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection agent and were found to inhibit apoB secretion (Fig.\u00a08A) without affecting apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a08B) in Huh-7\u00a0cells, thus suggesting that they are physiologically active. Next, we evaluated their efficacy when they were provided to cells without Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent. All analogs potently inhibited apoB secretion (Fig.\u00a08C) but had no significant effect on apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a08D). In all cases, >50% inhibition of apoB secretion was seen with 100\u00a0nM concentrations of these analogs (Fig.\u00a08C). A comparison of the data in Figure\u00a08, A and C suggested that these analogs might be more potent when delivered without lipid emulsions. Next, we verified the effects of different concentrations of the most potent analog, C2, on apoB secretion in Huh-7\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a08E). The analog C2 yielded a concentration-dependent decrease in apoB secretion, with an IC50 value of 20\u00a0nM. At higher concentrations, the maximum reduction in apoB secretion was \u223c60% (Fig.\u00a08E). At all concentrations, analog C2 had no effect on apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a08F). These studies indicated that the addition of phosphorothioate linkages increases the efficacy of different analogs in decreasing apoB secretion and that analog C2 is a potent inhibitor of apoB secretion.Table\u00a03MiR-30c analogs and sequences containing GalNAc and different phosphorothioate linkagesCompoundShort formStrandSequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032)miR30c-C1C1miR-30c-1-3p(pC)\u2022U\u2022gGgAgAgGgUuGuUuAcUc\u2022CmiR30c-C2C2miR-30c-1-3p(pC)\u2022UgGgAgAgGgUuGuUuAc\u2022U\u2022c\u2022CmiR30c-C3C3miR-30c-1-3p(pC)\u2022U\u2022gGgAgAgGgUuGuUuAc\u2022U\u2022c\u2022CmiR30c-C4C4miR-30c-1-3pGgGaGaGgGuUgUuUaCuC(pC)\u2022umiR30c-C5C5miR-30c-1-3pGgGaGaGgGuUgUuUaCu\u2022C\u2022(pC)\u2022umiR30c-C6C6miR-30c-1-3pC\u2022u\u2022GgGaGaGgGuUgUuUaCuC(pC)uUpper case letters, 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluoro (2\u2032-F) ribosugar modifications; lower case letters, 2\u2032-OMe ribosugar modifications; (pC), 2\u2032-GalNAc-clicked cytidine; \u201c\u2022\u201d symbol represents phosphorothioate linkages.Figure\u00a08Effects of various phosphorothioate-linked miR-30c analogs on apoB secretion in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells.

                        "It is known that reductions in apoB secretion are associated with hepatosteatosis. However, we have previously shown that miR-30c reduces apoB secretion without causing steatosis (25). Here, we investigated whether analog C2 causes steatosis or not in Huh-7\u00a0cells. As shown before (Fig.\u00a08), analog C2 significantly reduced (>50%) apoB secretion without affecting apoA1 secretion (Fig.\u00a09, A and B). Analog C2 had no effect on cellular triglyceride and cholesterol levels (Fig.\u00a09, C and D). These studies showed that analog C2 reduces apoB secretion but does not increase cellular lipid levels.Figure\u00a09Effects of C2 analog on lipid levels in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells and in human primary hepatocytes.A and B, Huh-7\u00a0cells were incubated in triplicate with miR-30c or C2 analog (200\u00a0nM) without Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent.

                "Our previous studies have shown that miR-30c is a good candidate to lower plasma lipids without causing hepatosteatosis. Therefore, we attempted to develop potent miR-30c analogs that could be used as potential therapeutic agents for lowering plasma lipid levels. The successful synthesis of an azido-modified GalNAc moiety (GalNAc\u03b1ProN3) allowed us to selectively attach the GalNAc molecule at any location of the RNA oligonucleotide modified with an alkyne group. This synthesis design gave us the flexibility to explore the most effective modified passenger strand of miR-30c with the best cell-penetrating capacity. This design could also be extended to other miR systems. By introducing a variety of chemical modifications and phosphorothioate linkages, we improved the efficacy of the miR-30c analogs in reducing apoB secretion in Huh-7\u00a0cells. Addition of GalNAc residues at either end circumvented the need for lipid emulsions for delivery to hepatoma cells. Mechanistic studies showed that these analogs reduced MTP mRNA and thus behaved similarly to native miR-30c. Furthermore, analog C2 reduced apoB secretion in human primary hepatocytes. These studies provide evidence that the passenger strand of miR-30c can be modified to enhance cellular delivery without lipid emulsions. This system might be more cost effective than delivery with lipid emulsions.",
                "To assess cellular toxicity, we studied apoA1 secretion, in parallel, in all studies. All the analogs had no effect on apoA1 secretion. Therefore, decreases in apoB secretion are a specific response to these analogs and were not secondary to cellular toxicity. Reductions in apoB secretion are associated with increases in cellular lipids. However, analog C2 had no effect on cellular triglyceride and cholesterol levels in Huh-7\u00a0cells and human primary hepatocytes. Therefore, these limited studies revealed no undesirable side effects.",
                "In summary, we report the successful synthesis of various miR-30c analogs that potently inhibit MTP activity and apoB secretion. These studies corroborate our previous findings regarding the utility of miR-30c in reducing apoB secretion by liver cells and provide evidence that modification of miR-30c in the passenger strand can be useful to improve its stability and delivery into hepatoma cells. Whether these analogs can be used as therapeutic agents to lower plasma lipids and atherosclerosis in animal models remains to be determined."

Proteins (25\u00a0\u03bcg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). A polyclonal rabbit primary antibody to human MTP (Abcam; catalog no.: ab63467) and a monoclonal rabbit antibody to \u03b2-actin (Cell Signaling Technology; catalog no.: 8457) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-rabbit immunogobulin G, horseradish peroxidase\u2013linked secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; catalog no.: 7074) was used at 1:2000 dilution. The blots were developed with a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging system (Bio-Rad). To determine the MTP activity, 50\u00a0\u03bcg of total proteins was used. Fluorescently labeled triglyceride transfer assays were performed as previously described (25, 28, 29, 47)."

                        "To extend our studies about the efficacy of different miR-30c analogs beyond human hepatoma Huh-7\u00a0cells, we purchased human primary hepatocytes (H1000.H15B+; lot no.: HC4-25) from Sekisui XenoTech. Cells were thawed using Sekisui XenoTech\u2019s thawing protocol and OptiThaw Hepatocyte Kit. After seeding in collagen-coated plates, cells were treated with the analog C2. After 72\u00a0h, media were collected to measure apoB and apoA1 levels using ELISA. Cells were collected in 0.1\u00a0N NaOH to measure protein levels. Secretion of apoB and apoA1 was normalized to cellular protein. Data are presented as control of miR-30c.",
                        "To determine whether analog C2 increases cellular lipid levels, cells were washed with PBS. To each well, 500\u00a0\u03bcl of isopropanol was added, and plate was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next day, we collected supernatants, dried, and resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of isopropanol to measure total triglycerides and cholesterol using commercial kits (Pointe Scientific). To each well, 500\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.1\u00a0N NaOH was added to determine the protein concentration for normalization. Lipid levels were normalized to protein levels, and data from miR-30c-treated cells were used as control."
