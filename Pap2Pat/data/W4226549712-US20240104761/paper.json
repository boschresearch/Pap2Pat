    "abstract": "To make full use of computer vision technology in stores, it is required to consider the actual needs that fit the characteristics of the retail scene. Pursuing this goal, we introduce the United Retail Datasets (Unitail), a large-scale benchmark of basic visual tasks on products that challenges algorithms for detecting, reading, and matching. With 1.8M quadrilateral-shaped instances annotated, the Unitail offers a detection dataset to align product appearance better. Furthermore, it provides a gallery-style OCR dataset containing 1454 product categories, 30k text regions, and 21k transcriptions to enable robust reading on products and motivate enhanced product matching. Besides benchmarking the datasets using various start-of-the-arts, we customize a new detector for product detection and provide a simple OCR-based matching solution that verifies its effectiveness. The Unitail and its evaluation server is publicly available at https://unitedretail.github.io .",

                "With the rise of deep learning, numerous computer vision algorithms have been developed and have pushed many real-world applications to a satisfactory level. Currently, various visual sensors (fixed cameras, robots, drones, mobile phones, etc.) are deployed in retail stores, enabling advanced computer vision methods in shopping and restocking. Scene Product Recognition (SPR) is the foundation module in most of these frameworks, such as planogram compliance, out-of-stock managing, and automatic check-out.",
                "SPR refers to the automatic detection and recognition of products in complex retail scenes. It comprises steps that first localize products and then recognize them via the localized appearance, analogous to many recognition tasks. However, scene products have their characteristics: they are densely-packed, low-shot, fine-grained, and widely-categorized. These innate characteristics result in obvious challenges and will be a continuing problem. Recent datasets in retail scenes follow the typical setting in the common scene to initiate the momentum of research in SPR. For instance, the SKU110k dataset [18], which has recently enabled large-scale product detection, is following the MS-COCO [37] style annotation and evaluation metric. Despite their significant value, the underpaid attention to the SPR's characteristics leads us to the question: what is the next advance towards SPR?",
                "Firstly, traditional detection targets poorly comply with the actual needs, causing improper image alignment of the product appearances. Detection targets in common scenes [37,66,12,10] are usually defined as covering the utmost visible entirety of an object with a minimal rectangle box. This format is inherited by most existing retail datasets [18,63,15,59,2]. However, because occlusion occurs more frequently between products (the densely-packed characteristic), improper alignments can easily hinder the detection performance. Detectors equipped with Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) suffer from the overlaps among the axisaligned rectangular bounding boxes (AABB) and rotated rectangular bounding boxes (RBOX). Moreover, poor alignment leads to inconsistent image registration of the same products, which brings extra difficulties to accurate recognition.",
                "Secondly, even in the well-aligned cases, products from intra-classes require discriminative features due to their fine-grained characteristic. On the one hand, a slight variation in the product packaging can significantly change the product price, especially for the visually similar but textually different regions such as brand/model, flavour/version, ingredient/material, count/net weight. This requires SPR algorithms to pay attention to the particular text patterns. On the other hand, due to the labelling effort on thousands of categories per store (the widely-categorized characteristic), the available samples per category are scarce (the low-shot characteristic), which degrades the SPR robustness. These two constraints are in conjunction with our empirical observation that visual classifiers could frequently make mistakes when products look similar but vary in text information.",
                "In this paper, we introduce the United Retail Datasets (Unitail) that responds to these issues. The Unitail is a comprehensive benchmark composed of two datasets: Unitail-Det and Unitail-OCR, and currently supports four tasks in real-world retail scene: Product Detection, Text Detection, Text Recognition, and Product Matching. (Fig. 1) Unitail-Det, as one of the largest quadrilateral object detection datasets in terms of instance number and the only existing product dataset in quadrilateral annotations by far, is designed to support well-aligned product detection. Unitail-Det enjoys two key features: 1. Bounding boxes of products are densely annotated in the quadrilateral style that cover the frontal face of products. Practically, Quadrilaterals (QUADs) adequately reflect the shapes and poses of most products regardless of the viewing angles, and efficiently cover the irregular shapes. The frontal faces of products provide distinguishable visual information and keep the appearances consistent. 2. In order to evaluate the robustness of the detectors across stores, the test set consists of two subsets to support both origin-domain and cross-domain evaluation. While one subset shares the domain Fig. 1: The Unitail is a large-scale benchmark in retail scene that consists of two sub-datasets and supports four basic tasks.",
                "with the training set, the other is independently collected from other different stores, with diverse optical sensors, and from various camera perspectives.",
                "Unitail-OCR (Optical Character Recognition) aims to drive research and applications using visual texts as representations for products. This direction is partially inspired by the customers' behavior: people can glance and recognize ice cream but need to scrutinize the flavor and calories to make a purchase. It is organized into three tasks: text detection, text recognition, and product matching. Product images in Unitail-OCR are selected from the Unitail-Det and benefit from the quadrilateral aligned annotations. Each is equipped with onproduct text location and textual contents together with its category. Due to the product's low-shot and widely-categorized characteristics, product recognition is operated by matching within an open-set gallery. To the best of our knowledge, Unitail-OCR is the first dataset to support OCR models' training and evaluation on the retail products, and it is experimentally verified to fill in the domain blank; when evaluated on a wide variety of product texts, models trained on Unitail-OCR outperform those trained on common scene texts [26]. It is also the first dataset that enables the exploration of text-based solutions to product matching.",
                "Based on the proposed Unitail, we design two baselines. To detect products, we analyze the limitation of applying generic object detectors in the retail scene and design RetailDet to detect quadrilateral products. To match products using visual texts on 2D space, we encode text features with spatial positional encoding and use Hungarian Algorithm [31] that calculates optimal assignment plans between varying text sequences.",
                "Our contributions are summarized in three folds: (1) we introduce the Unitail, a comprehensive benchmark for well-aligned textually enhanced SPR. (2) We benchmark the tasks of Unitail with various off-the-shelf methods, including [76,62,61,34,41,65,47,21,55,54,70,33,32,13,23,22,57,44]. (3) we design two baselines for product detection and text-based product matching."

                "The retail scene has drawn attention to the computer vision community for an extended period. The early evolution of product datasets [40,29,52] facilitates reliable training and evaluation and drives research in this challenging field. Recently, large-scale datasets [6,18] has enabled deep learning based approaches. Datasets related to SPR can be split into two groups: product detection and product recognition. We address each in this section.",
                "Product Detection Datasets Detection is the first step in SPR entailing the presence of products that are typically represented by rectangular bounding boxes. The GroZi-120 [40] was created using in situ and in vitro data to study the product detection and recognition with 120 grocery products varying in color, size, and shape. The D2S [14] is an instance segmentation benchmark for sparsely-placed product detection, with 21000 images and 72447 instances. The SKU110k [18] and the SKU110k-r [45] provide 11762 images with 1.7M on-shelf product instances; they are annotated with axis-aligned bounding boxes and rotated bounding boxes, respectively.",
                "For the detection of coarsely categorized products, The RPC [63] is designed for checkout scenarios containing 0.4M instances and 200 products. The Grocery Shelves dataset [59] took 354 shelf images and 13k instances, and around 3k instances are noted in 10 brand classes. The Locount [2] simultaneously considers the detection and counting for groups of products, with an impressive number of 1.9M instances and 140 categories.",
                "Despite the significant values of these datasets, we are still challenged by the availability of optimal bounding boxes. In the proposed Unitail-Det, we aim to shape products into quadrilaterals whose appearances are well aligned. The dataset also provides evaluation targets in the origin-domain and cross-domain, bringing algorithms closer to practical deployment.",
                "Product Recognition Datasets Multiple product recognition datasets have been built over the past decades. Early ones have limitations in the diversity of categories and amount of images, such as the SOIL-47 [29] containing 47 categories, the Supermarket Produce Datasets [52] with 15 categories, and the Freiburg Groceries [25] covering 25 categories. Recent collections like Products-6K [17] and Products-10K [1] focus on large-scale data, which satisfy the training of deep learning algorithms. AliProducts [6] is crawled from web sources by searching 50K product names, consequently containing 2.5 million noisy images without human annotations. The ABO [8] dataset covers 576 categories that studies the 3D object understanding. The Grozi-3.2K [15] contains 80 fine-grained grocery categories and 8350 images for multi-label classification. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of a dataset that encourages leveraging both visual and textual information for product recognition.",
                "OCR on Retail Products Product recognition by texts is challenging. The lack of datasets obstructs the relevant research on this topic. The most relevant dataset is Products-6K [17] where the Google Cloud Vision API is employed to extract the textual information to enhance products' descriptions. But the texts were not labelled by human annotators, and text location information is missing, so it is infeasible to support any advance to OCR related tasks.",
                "There are a couple of attempts that use off-the-shelf OCR models for assisted shopping. [16] presented a system on which users search products by name and OCR models return the texts on products so that a product list ranked by word histogram is generated for the users. [43] recognize texts and then apply text embedding and language models to extract features for product verification.",
                "Other Related Datasets Many OCR datasets [56,42,7,26,27,38,51,69,24,20] exist prior to Unitail-OCR. Typically, an OCR dataset supports text detection and text recognition and so enables text spotting. The ICDAR2015 [26] and CTW1500 [38] are two widely applied benchmarks for training and evaluating OCR models in common scene. The ICDAR2015 has 1,000 training and 500 testing images causally shot indoor and outdoor with word-level annotations for each text. The CTW1500 contains 10k text (3.5k of them are curved boxes) in 1500 images collected from the internet. Compared to them, Unitail-OCR is the first that focuses on product texts and supports object-level matching task at the same time. Product texts are usually artistic words with substantial character distortions, which are hard to be localize and recognize.",

The resolution and camera angles cover an extensive range by different sensors. For example, fixed cameras are mounted on the ceiling in most cases, and customers prefer to photograph with mobile devices. The product categories in different stores also span a great range. With these factors in mind, we collect images from two sources to support origindomain and cross-domain detection. In the origin domain, training and testing  images are supposed to share the same domain and are taken from similar perspectives in the same stores by the same sensors. As a result, we select the 11,744 images from the prior largest product dataset, SKU110k [18], to form the origin domain. In the cross domain, we collect 500 images in different stores through multiple sensors, covering unseen categories and camera angles.",
                        "Annotation We annotate each product with a quadrilateral style bounding box, denoted as QUAD. Fig. 2 is an illustration of its advance. A QUAD refers to 4 points p tl , p tr , p br , p bl with 8 degrees of freedom (x tl , y tl , x tr , y tr , x br , y br , x bl , y bl ). For regular products shaped mainly in cuboid and cylinder, the (x tl ,y tl ) is defined as the top-left corners of their frontal faces, and the other points represent the rest 3 corners in clockwise order. For spherical, cones, and other shapes whose corners are difficult to identify, and for irregularly shaped products where so defined quadrilateral box cannot cover the entire frontal face, we first draw the minimum AABB and then adjust the four corners according to the camera perspective. As belabored, the frontal face of a product has the most representative information and is also critical for appearance consistency, but we still annotate the side face if the front face is invisible.",
                        "Totally, 1,777,108 QUADs are annotated by 13 well-trained annotators in 3 rounds of verification.

The cross-domain supports a testing set (500 images, 37,071 QUADs). Their density and scale are shown in Fig. 3 3.2 Unitail-OCR Gallery and Testing Suite A product gallery setup is a common practice in the retail industry for product matching applications. All known categories are first registered in the gallery. In case of a query product, the matching algorithms find the top ranked category in the gallery. The gallery of Unitail-OCR contains Fig. 4: Unitail-OCR statistical graphic. The pie chart reflects sections that source images were collected from. The bar chart is a histogram for the count of words on products. The font size of the words reflects the frequency of occurrence.",

The feature pyramid is generated via feature pyramid network (FPN) [35] and contains different levels that are gradually down-sampled but semantically enhanced. An anchor-free detection head is then attached to classify each pixel on the feature pyramid and predict axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB).",
                        "During training, assigning ground-truths to each feature pixels on the feature pyramid plays a key role. On each pyramid level, the centerness [58] is widely used. It is an indicator to value how far a pixel locates from the center of a ground-truth: the farther, the more likely it is to predict an inaccurate box, and the lower centerness score it gains. Across pyramid levels, various strategies are proposed to determine which level should be assigned, and they are grouped into scale-based and loss-based strategies. The scale-based [35,28,50,58] assigns ground-truths to different levels in terms of their scales. The larger scale, the higher level is assigned so that the needs of receptive field and resolution of feature maps are balanced. The loss-based like Soft Selection [74] assigns groundtruths by calculating their losses on all levels, and trains an auxiliary network that re-weights the losses. Our design, RetailDet, adopts the DenseBox style architecture but predicts the four corners of quadrilateral by 8-channel regression head. During training, we found the prior assignment strategies unsuitable for quadrilateral products, which is specified below. Centerness The previous definition of the centerness [58,74] is shown in Eq.1,",

Rather than using the n recognized words, we use the n intermediate feature vectors from the text recognizer to mitigate propagated errors. For example, CREAM is confused as CRE4w, but the intermediate feature should maintain information on A and M , which is more robust than the false prediction. Each feature is then added by a 2D positional encoding [46,3] whose calculation is based on the location of the corresponding text. It encodes the spatial information into the feature and it is predefined to keep the same dimension as the intermediate feature.

These methods can be grouped into segmentation based methods [76,62,61,34,21] and regression based methods [41,65,47]. Segmentation methods consider QUADs as per-pixel classification masks for each region of interest, while regression methods directly regress the bounding boxes. Table 1 shows their performances. Overall, regression based methods outperform segmentation based methods because most products can be well aligned by quadrilaterals, and the learning on segmentation mask involves extra difficulties. The RetailDet outperforms other detectors by a large margin. All detectors achieve degraded results in the cross-domain as opposed to the origin-domain, confirming that domain shift exists among stores. Text Detection & Text Recognition We benchmark the tasks of text detection and text recognition in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. For each of the listed algorithms, it is trained under two setting: one is following a common setting that trained on SynthText [20] and ICDAR2015(IC15) [26] for text detection and on Synth90K [24] and SynthText for text recognition, another is trained/finetuned on the Unitail. As shown all algorithms achieve better performance if trained on the Unitail, this verifies that texts in the retail domain are better handled by the proposed dataset."

Axis-aligned rectangles are popular because they satisfy the minimum requirement for learning targets with minimum labeling efforts. Annotations with more accurate localization and appearance alignment are needed in this task. While segmentation masks are another level of accuracy for annotating scene objects, they are not cost-friendly, and the direct regression on bounding boxes is easier for densely-packed products than the segmentation methods verified in the benchmark.",
                "To ensure the quality of annotation, annotators follow a strictly defined guide. Illustrated in Fig. 7, products localized far away from the camera and with a size less than 8 \u00d7 8 pixels are not treated as positive. Instead, we annotate ignoring masks covering the distant regions for these products. Cuboid and cylinder (boxes, cans, bottles), as the majority in stores, enjoy normal quadrilaterals defined in the paper; spherical and cones whose corners are difficult to identify, along with irregularly shaped products and distorted bags are expected to be affine-transformed back into an upright position. In those cases, we first draw the minimum AABB to cover them and then adjust the four corners according to the camera perspective. Only the visible part is annotated if another product or tag blocks one product. Many products have multiple faces observable, and only the frontal face of the products is practically annotated. Labelme [60] is applied as an annotation tool. The aspect ratio of a rectangle is commonly defined as w h . We measure the aspect ratio of QUAD as in Eq.9",
                "where t, b, l, r are lengths of top, bottom, left, and right edge, respectively. Fig. 8 (c) illustrates the aspect ratio. Most ratios are around 0.3 -0.6, which is in line The interior angles of any convex QUAD add up to 360 degrees of arc. The standard deviation of these angles (std a ) is a qualified reflection of the QUAD shape. For rectangles, std a = 0. For a extreme QUAD looks close to a line segment, std a = 90. In the origin-domain of QuadRetail, the std a = 6.24. In the cross-domain, the std a = 12.73. This means the images from the cross-domain are from taken from tougher angles."

Products with scales larger than 15\u00d715 are further selected. The categorization is organized by two hierarchical stages. In the first stage, ten supercategories (food, dairy, paper goods, canned, produce, clothing, Technology, Pharmacy, Care, other) are defined to classify the products coarsely. In the second stage, we first apply a strong pre-trained model trained with a bag of tricks to group the product into 6k clusters and correct them by human annotators. During the correction, we do not accept blurred products that are hard to identify. Many fine-grained categories rely on textual information, and the blurred ones that are difficult to read are filtered out. After the categorization, we label each product with word-level text boxes, following the annotation method in ICDAR2015 [26]. We annotate 29681 text regions from 4466 products as quadrilateral text boxes. The bounding boxes are classified as legible or illegible.

The feature pyramid is generated via feature pyramid network (FPN) [35] which utilizes a deep convolutional network as the backbone. As an image is fed into the backbone, several feature maps are extracted to compose the initial feature pyramid. This work adopts the ResNet family as the backbone, and the extracted feature maps are from C 3 to C 5 . The feature maps after FPN are denoted as P 3 , P 4 , P 5 . An anchor-free detection head is attached then. The head contains two branches. One is a binary classification branch to predict a heatmap for product/background. Another is a regression branch to predict the offset from the pixel location to the four corner points of the QUAD. Each branch consists of 3 stacks of convolutional layers followed by another c channel convolutional layer, where c equals to 1 for the classification branch and 8 for the regression branch.",

Then we apply the bilinear interpolation to extract feature of 5 points (4 corners, one center) from the feature map generated by the 3rd stacked convolution in the regression branch. These features are concatenated and fed into a 1 \u00d7 1 convolutional layer to predict the offsets between groundtruth and the former predictions. The same operation and convolution are also inserted in the classification branch to predict retail/background as a 2nd-stage classification. During testing, we combine the regression results from the two stages but only use the classification result from the first stage. CRM shares the spirits with Faster-RCNN [50], BorderDet [48] and Reppoints [68], but we find that the 5 points as mentioned above are enough for quadrilateral products, and the 2nd-stage classification helps training though not involved in testing.",

                "Soft Selection is a loss-based strategy, where training losses of ground-truths indicate their pyramid level. It first assigns each object to all pyramid levels P 3 , P 4 , P 5 and calculates loss l for each level P l . l=3,4,5. Then, the level that produces the minimal loss is converted to a one-hot vector, i.e., (1,0,0) if the minimal loss is from P 3 ; and (0,1,0) if it is from P 4 , and so on. The vector is used as the ground-truth to train an auxiliary network that simultaneously predicts a vector (F 3 , F 4 , F 5 ). Each element F l is a down-weighting factor for loss l . The final loss of each object is l (F l \u2022 loss l ).",
                "By Soft Selection, the minimal loss from level l indicates that the auxiliary network is trained to generate a relatively larger F l , but we find the loss not independent of scales. On the contrary, object scale inherently determines which level will produce the minimal loss. We claim the reason as follows. First, when assigning objects (e.g. object A with size 8 \u00d7 8 and B with size 16 \u00d7 16) to pyramid, their regression targets (denoted as T A , T B ) are normalized by the level stride. Specifically, on a lower level like P 3 , the target is divided by stride 8, while on a higher level like P 4 , the target is divided by 16, and so on. Therefore, when assigning A to P 3 and P 4 , T A is 1 \u00d7 1 and 0.5 \u00d7 0.5, respectively; when assigning B, T B is 2 \u00d7 2 and 1 \u00d7 1, respectively. Note that all levels share the detection head. Apparently, the combination of T A = 1 \u00d7 1 and T B = 1 \u00d7 1 Table 7: Detection performance on SKU110k-r.",
                "leads to the smallest regression difficulty for the regression head. Naturally, it produces minimal regression losses, which means the smaller object is assigned to a lower level. Second, since A has a smaller scale, it requires more local finegrained information beneficial for classification, which is more available from high-resolution lower levels. In comparison, B has a larger scale and needs a larger receptive field, which is more available from higher levels. Therefore, the \"loss-based\" Soft Selection, in essence, follows the scale-based law. Nevertheless, why does Soft Selection outperforms scale-based strategies? We credit the improvement to its loss-reweighting mechanism. This mechanism involves multiple levels during training and reweights the loss in terms of the regression and classification difficulties, making optimization easier. Since the pyramid is discrete, if an object scale falls into the gap of two adjacent levels, both levels' difficulties will be similar. The auxiliary network has opportunities to learn to predict proper F l for both levels. The analysis motivates us to abandon the auxiliary network and design Soft Scale (SS)."
