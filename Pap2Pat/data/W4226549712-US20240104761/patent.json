                        "In a retail setting, it is desirable to be able to use computer vision methods to detect and identify products on a retail shelf to aid in management of the retail establishment. For example, computer vision may be used to detect and identify products for various tasks, such as tracking product inventory, determining out-of-stock products and determining misplaced products. Product detection is one of the fastest-moving areas and plays a fundamental role in many retail applications such as product recognition, planogram compliance, out-of-stock management, and check-out free shopping.",
                        "To this end, numerous computer vision methods have been developed and many real-world applications based on those computer vision methods perform at a satisfactory level. Currently, various visual sensors (e.g., fixed cameras, robots, drones, and mobile phones) have been deployed in retail stores, enabling the application of advanced technologies to ease shopping and store management tasks.",
                        "Object detectors typically comprise a localization sub-network that feeds downstream tasks, such as pose estimation, fine-grained classification, and similarity matching. Most downstream tasks require that the localization sub-network provide a bounding area for each object, for example, products in a retail setting. Therefore, for scene understanding in 2D images, the first step is to detect the objects and represent them by 2D bounding boxes. It is crucial to ensure that the bounding boxes are well aligned with the detected objects to provide accurate information about the products for the downstream tasks. The bounding box is expected to cover the most representative pixels and accurately locate the product while concurrently excluding as much noisy context, as possible, such as background. Retail scene product detection typically output axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) regardless of the pose of the product.",
                        "However, products can be of arbitrary poses in a real-world retail scene, especially when the image is taken by a camera not facing straight towards the shelf, as shown in FIG. 1. Because of mutual occlusion, rotation, distortion, and restricted shooting angles in retail scenarios, previous datasets and detectors have difficulty drawing proper bounding boxes to satisfy these requirements because an AABB is not able to be perfectly aligned with the actual boundaries of the ill-posed products. If AABBs are used as the bounding box shape to annotate the products, there will always be irrelevant background included in the boxes or parts of the products will be cut out, as shown in FIG. 1. As such, the most precise object regions cannot be retrieved. Therefore, the features extracted from these object regions may not be accurate for the downstream tasks."

First, the quadrilateral boxes do not include unnecessary background information or miss parts of the objects, so that features extracted from the predicted bounding boxes are precise and informative. Second, a quadrilateral box itself already encodes some pose information of the enclosed object. With a simple 2D projection transformation, the pose can be normalized as if the camera is facing straight towards the object. Thus, a simple projection transformation can be applied to correct the pose of products for downstream tasks.",

                        "There are two aspects to the disclosed invention. In the first aspect, a quadrilateral training dataset containing images of retail products annotated with quadrilateral-shaped bounding boxes is developed and used to train the quadrilateral detector. In the second aspect, a strong quadrilateral detector is disclosed that out-performs prior art detectors on the quadrilateral training dataset. The detector produces quadrilateral bounding boxes, as shown in FIG. 2, that provide the advantages of excluding unnecessary background information and more precisely including pixels representing the actual product.",
                        "Quadrilateral Training Dataset",
                        "The training database is designed with three features to solve the aforementioned challenges: (1) bounding boxes of products are densely labeled in quadrilateral style by well-trained annotators and multiple rounds of re-correction. Exemplary bounding box annotations are illustrated in FIG. 2. Quadrilaterals can adequately reflect the shape and pose of most products like boxes, bottles, cans, chests, and bags regardless of the shooting angles, and efficiently handle the irregular cases like clothes, balls, sunglasses, etc.; (2) the quadrilateral bounding box annotations only cover the front face of products (See FIG. 3(b)) when multiple faces are visible, as opposed to AABB, which would cover all exposed faces (See FIG. 3(a)). The front face of the products provide the most distinguishing information about the product and keeps the appearance consistent for the same products; and (3) two different testing sets support two product detection tasks: origin-domain detection and cross-domain detection. One testing set shares the domain with the training set, while another is independently collected from different stores, with different shooting equipment, and at more difficult shooting angles.",
                        "Image Collection\u2014Practically, a variety of sensors are utilized under different conditions for on-shelf product detection. The resolution and shooting angles cover an extensive range by different types of sensors. Specifically, robots usually take high brightness pictures from the bottom up using high-quality cameras and build-in light source, shaping most products into a trapezoid shape. Fixed cameras are, in most cases, mounted on the ceiling, creating low-resolution images from top to bottom; staff and customers prefer to photograph with mobile phones from the front or side, shaping products into a rhomboid shape. The product categories sold in different stores also show a great deal of variety.",
                        "Considering these factors, images are collected from two sources to support origin-domain and cross-domain detection. In the origin domain, training and testing images share a similar style and are pictured at similar angles in the same stores by the same sensors. As a result, images are selected from a prior product dataset to form the origin domain.",
                        "These images have three properties: (1) They are collected from a limited number (e.g., <5) of stores worldwide; (2) All images are shot by humans holding mobile phones from side or front perspectives; and (3) The diversity of categories is rich but still highly limited.",
                        "In the cross domain, approximately 500 images are collected in 5 different stores (100 for each) from multiple sensors, cover unseen categories, and mimic the view angles of fixed cameras and robots.",
                        "Annotation\u2014Each product is annotated with a quadrilateral bounding box, referred to here as a \u201cQUAD\u201d. A QUAD refers to 4 points ptl, ptr, pbr, pbl with 8 degrees of freedom (xtl, ytl, xtr, ytr, xbr, ybr, xbl, ybl) For regular shaped products mainly in cuboid and cylinder containers, the (xtl, ytl) is defined as the top-left corner of the front face of the product, and the other points represent the other corners in clockwise order. For spheres, cones, and other cases, for which it is hard to identify corners, or front faces, and for irregular-shaped products where such defined quadrilaterals cannot cover the entire front face, the minimum AABB is first drawn and the four corners are then adjusted following the perspective transformation. The front face has the most representative information and is also critical for consistent appearance, but the side face is still annotated if the front face is invisible.",
                        "In one embodiment, in total, 1,777,108 QUADs are annotated by 13 well-trained annotators in 3 rounds of correction. The origin domain is split to training (8,216 images, 1,215,013 QUADs), validation (588 images, 92,128 QUADs), and origin-domain testing set (2,940 images, 432,896 QUADs). The cross domain composes the cross-domain testing set (500 images, 37,071 QUADs).",
                        "Quadrilateral Detector",
                        "A strong baseline quadrilateral detector designed exclusively for quadrilateral product detection is disclosed. The base network will be introduced first. Afterward, a quadrilateral ground-truth assignment strategy is disclosed. Finally, a corner refinement module is disclosed.",
                        "The quadrilateral detector extends the localization subnet to have different output definitions. In one embodiment, a quadrilateral box is represented as Q={pi|i\u2208{1, 2, 3, 4}}, where pi={xi, yi} are vertices of the bounding box, as shown in FIG. 4. The localization subnet has 4 additional channels (8 channels total, 4 pairs) in the output map. Each pair of channels correspond to the distance offset (\u0394xi, \u0394yi) from the central points to pi if the central points are positive. During training, the offsets are normalized by the feature stride and smooth L1 loss is applied for optimization.",
                        "Base Network\u2014An architectural diagram of the base network appears in FIG. 5. The design of the base network applies a prior-art DenseBox-style head to multiple feature pyramid levels. The feature pyramid 502 is generated via a feature pyramid network (FPN) which utilizes a deep convolutional network as the backbone. As an image 504 is fed into the backbone and several feature maps are extracted to compose the initial feature pyramid. The ResNet family is adopted as the backbone, and the extracted feature maps are from C3 to C5. Generally, low feature pyramid levels have high resolution but weak semantic information (i.e., these feature maps are gradually down-sampled but semantically enhanced). The FPN leverages a top-down module that up-samples the high feature pyramid levels and sums them to the adjacent lower levels to enhance semantic information. The feature maps after the FPN are denoted as P3, P4, P5. An anchor free detection head is then attached. The head contains two branches. One is a binary classification branch 506 to predict a heatmap for product/background. Another is a regression branch 508 to predict the offset from the pixel location to the four corner points of the QUAD. Each branch consists of 3 stacks of convolutional layers followed by another c channel convolutional layer, where c=1 for the classification branch and c=8 for the regression branch.",
                        "Quadrilateral Ground-truth Assignment\u2014The ground-truth assignment strategy plays a vital role in the training phase. Here, two aspects are focused on: (1) on-map assignment; and (2) cross-pyramid assignment.",
                        "On-map: Quadrilateral Centerness\u2014The common definition of the centerness of an AABB is shown in Eq. (1):",

                        "By Eq. (1), the feature pixel pij at position (i, j) is considered as the \u201ccenter point\u201d if it keeps the same distances to the left and right AABB boundaries (dpl and dpr), and, concurrently, keeps the same distances to the top and bottom AABB boundaries (dpt and dpb). This is denoted it as the \u201cAABB center\u201d. The AABB center has the highest centerness as 1, and the other pixels have degraded centerness calculated by Eq. (1). However, when adopting the AABB center to quadrilaterals, as shown in FIG. 6(a), the center can be far away from a corner, which leads to unbalanced regression difficulty and lack of receptive field from that corner.",
                        "To solve the above problem, the \u201cQUAD center\u201d is defined as the center of gravity, not only because it is the geometric center of the QUAD but also because it represents the mean position of all the points in the shape, which mitigates the unbalanced regression difficulties, as shown in FIG. 6(b). Eq. (2) can then be used to calculate the quad-centerness for any pij:",

                        "It is mentionable that the centerness calculated by Eq. (1) is a special instantiation of the quad-centerness calculated by Eq. (2). This is because, when QUAD is specialized to an AABB, dgl=dgr and dpl=2dgl such that Eq. (2) is mathematically equivalent to Eq. (1).",
                        "Cross-Pyramid: Soft Scale\u2014A fast assignment strategy across pyramid levels is crucial for training where each image contains hundreds of objects. Prior strategies are typically scale-based (i.e., assigning objects to different levels in terms of their scales). The larger the scale, the higher the level to which the objects are assigned, so that the needs of receptive field and resolution of feature maps are well balanced. Recently, a new loss-based strategy has been proposed, termed Soft Selection, where object scale does not indicate pyramid level. Instead, it first assigns each object to all pyramid levels P3, P4, P5 and calculates boss/for each level Pl (which, in this case, l=3, 4, 5). Then, the level that produces the minimal loss is converted to a one-hot vector (i.e., (1,0,0)) if the minimal loss is from P3; (0,1,0) if it is from P4, and so on). The vector is used as the ground-truth to train an auxiliary network that simultaneously predicts a vector (F3, F4, F5). Each element Fl is a down-weighting factor for lossl. The final loss of each object is \u03a3l(Fl\u00b7lossl).",
                        "The Soft Selection outperforms scale-based strategies on generic datasets. However, it is highly inefficient because it independently calculates losses for each object and slowly trains the auxiliary network. In practice, when the number of instances per image becomes large, the training process takes exceptionally longer (\u02dc4x-5x) than scale-based strategies.",
                        "The merit of Soft Selection can be maintained while accelerating the assignment by accounting for the relationship between loss and scale. By Soft Selection, the minimal loss from level l indicates that the auxiliary network is trained to generate a relatively larger Fl, but the loss is not independent of scales. On the contrary, object scale inherently determines which level will produce the minimal loss. The reason is as follows. First, when assigning objects (e.g., object A with size 8\u00d78 and B with size 16\u00d716) to the pyramid, their regression targets (denoted as TA, TB) are normalized by the level stride. Specifically, on a lower level (like P3), the target is divided by stride 8, while on a higher level (like P4), the target is divided by 16, and so on. Therefore, when assigning A to P3 and P4, TA is 1\u00d71 and 0.5\u00d70.5, respectively; when assigning B, TB is 2\u00d72 and 1\u00d71, respectively. Note that all levels share the detection head. The combination of and TA=1\u00d71 and TB=1\u00d71 leads to the smallest regression difficulty for the regression head. Naturally, it produces minimal regression losses, which means the smaller object is assigned to a lower level. Second, because A has a smaller scale, it requires more local fine-grained information beneficial for classification, which is more available from high-resolution, lower levels. In comparison, B has a larger scale and needs a larger receptive field, which is more available from higher levels. Therefore, the \u201closs-based\u201d Soft Selection, in essence, follows the scale-based law.",
                        "Nevertheless, Soft Selection outperforms scale-based strategies. The improvement can be credited to its loss reweighting mechanism. This mechanism involves multiple levels during training and reweights the loss in terms of the regression and classification difficulties, making optimization easier. Because the pyramid is discrete, if an object scale falls into the gap of two adjacent levels, the difficulty of both levels will be similar. The auxiliary network has opportunities to learn to predict proper Fl for both levels.",
                        "The analysis motivates the abandonment of the auxiliary network and design a scale-based solution named Soft Scale (SS). For an arbitrary shaped object O with area AreaO, SS assigns the object to two adjacent levels Pii and Plj by Eqs. (3) and (4) and calculates the loss-reweighting factors Fli, Flj by Eqs. (5) and (6) respectively.",

If an object is with area 2232, FPN assigns it to (lorg\u22121), while SS assigns it to lorg with Fl=0.994 and to (lorg\u22121) with Fl=0.006. Herein, lorg is fixed at 5. SS operates as rapidly as scale-based strategies, keeps the loss-reweighting like Soft Selection, and greatly improves the performance of the quadrilateral detector.",
                        "Corner Refinement Module\u2014A corner refinement module (CRM) is provided to make the quadrilateral detector two-stage. For each predicted QUAD from the quadrilateral detector, the locations of its four corners and center are obtained. Bilinear interpolation is then used to extract five features (4 corners and one center) from the feature map generated by the 3rd stacked convolution in the regression branch. These features are concatenated and fed into a 1\u00d71 convolutional layer to predict the difference between ground-truth and the previous prediction. The same operation and convolution are also inserted in the classification branch to predict object/background as a 2nd-stage classification. During testing, the regression results from the two stages are combined but only the classification result from the first stage is trusted. CRM shares the sprits with Faster-RCNN, but the 5 points mentioned above are enough for quadrilateral products, and the 2nd-stage classification supervision helps training, though not involved in testing.",

If one feature pixel locates inside the shrunk QUAD, the pixel is considered responsible for learning the ground-truth. Focal loss is utilized for classification and SmoothL1 loss is used for regression. Both losses are re-weighted by the production of quad-centerness and level reweighting factor F. The total loss is the summation of the classification and regression losses. If two-stage, additional focal loss and L1 loss for CRM are added to the total loss."
