                        "The present invention relates to brain stimulation systems. In particular, this invention relates to leads for brain stimulation systems that are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging.",
                        "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment in which an implanted medical device is used to regulate abnormal impulses or affect certain chemicals or cells in the brain. Typically this implanted medical device includes a brain pacemaker, often implanted under the skin in the upper chest, that sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS in select brain regions has provided therapeutic benefits for otherwise treatment-resistant movement and affective neurological disorders such as chronic pain, Parkinson's disease, tremors and dystonia. Deep brain stimulation is also being studied as an experimental treatment for epilepsy, cluster headaches, Tourette syndrome, chronic pain, stroke recovery, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, addiction disorders, obesity, brain injury, minimally conscious states, anorexia, tinnitus and major depression.",
                        "Many patients with DBS would benefit from regular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, as MRI is the preferred diagnostic tool for monitoring structural changes in the brain and for diagnosing injury due to trauma or evaluate comorbidities (for example, stroke and cancer, among others). Whole-body MRI examination is used in many common disorders including cancer, cardiovascular disease and trauma. Moreover, functional MRI could be potentially useful to study the effects of electrical stimulation of the basal ganglia.",
                        "Unfortunately, it has been found that magnetic MRI may cause deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes to become excessively hot and seriously damage adjacent brain tissue. Commercially-available DBS leads utilize crude metal wire, which act as antenna for the MRI radio frequency (RF) waves that are used during imaging to elicit signals from the brain tissue being imaged. The applied RF field induces currents along the conductive leads that can increase the RF power deposition at the distal tip of the leads and potentially result in excessive local heating at the electrode. To provide an appreciation of the potential heating effect, temperature increases up to 30\u00b0 C. were recently recorded on the electrodes of a DBS implant in an ultra-field MRI (at 9.4 T). Furthermore, FIG. 1B illustrates a map of specific absorption rate deposition from an electromagnetic simulation in which a sharp increase is predicted at a tip of an electrode in a brain.",
                        "In view of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved the use of metal wire in DBS leads by restricting their use to transmit head-only coils and fields up to 1.5 T. However, by excluding the use of transmit body coils (by far the most common type of transmit coils used) and 3 T or greater systems, MRI is severely limited as a diagnostic tool in patients with DBS implants. For example, the conditions under which the Medtronic MR-conditional DBS system can be used are extremely restrictive: it is possible to scan patients with DBS implants only with a transmit head coil and with a whole-head averaged Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of only 0.1 W/kg. Notably, the normal operating mode allows whole-head SAR of 3.2 W/kg. Transmit body coil, 3 T systems, and the state-of-the-art MRI multichannel transmit coils are all contraindicated.",
                        "Thus, while there are over 75,000 patients with DBS implants worldwide, only approximately one patient in twenty is assessed with MRI because of the restrictions on its use. More generally, because of safety concerns with the heating of leads, each year approximately 300,000 patients with implants such as implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), pacemaker, and DBS as well as guidewires, such as ablation catheters, are denied MRI.",
                        "Such restrictions are not misplaced, as two cases of serious, permanent neurological injury related to the antenna effect and excessive heating of DBS leads during MRI have been reported including one patient that experienced a temporary dystonia and another patient that developed a permanent hemiparalysis. In one case, a patient with two bilateral implants underwent a routine MRI of the lumbar spine and the high RF-induced currents generated by the body coil on the DBS implants (notably of different length) produced edema near one of the implants, illustrated in FIG. 1A, resulting in consequent paralysis.",
                        "MRI adverse events in DBS patients are anticipated to continue to be problematic because of an increasing number of scans. Further, as MRI is becoming available even in the smallest rural or private medical centers where MRI Safety educational training to clinical and technical personnel in MRI sites may not be readily available.",
                        "Hence, a need exists for an improved DBS system that is fully MRI-compatible."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "An improved lead is disclosed. According to one aspect, the lead is a lead for a deep brain stimulation system in which the lead is adapted for electrical communication with a neurostimulator and extends to a distal tip for attachment to at least one electrode. The lead comprises a lead wire comprising a liquid crystal polymer including conductive particles dispersed therein.",
                        "The liquid crystal polymer may include polyesterpolyarylate fibers. The conductive particles may nanoparticles such as, for example, gold nanoparticles having an average diameter of 4 to 5 \u03bcm or carbon nanoparticles having an average diameter of less than 1 \u03bcm. However, other polymers, conductive particles, and sizes of particles might be used in order to provide the DBS and MR compatible leads. The conductive particles may be melt polymerized with the liquid crystal polymer to disperse the conductive particles throughout the liquid crystal polymer. Other materials may also be used as fillers (apart from conductive particles), such as fiberglass, to improve physical characteristics.",
                        "The conductive nanoparticle or micro particles are also non-ferromagnetic and biocompatible, and may include carbon, gold, platinum, titanium, niobium, tantalum, cobalt-chromium, cobalt, stainless steel, chromium and zirconium. Alloys of non-ferromagnetic biocompatible nanoparticles and microparticles may also be used.",
                        "It is also contemplated that coated nano- or micro-particles that are non-ferromagnetic, biocompatible and conductive may be also used as conductive filler.",
                        "A coating can be introduced to improve other physical characteristics, such as: thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, corrosion resistance, density, elongation, fatigue endurance limit, melting and boiling points, hardness, impact energy, modulus of elasticity, corrosion behavior, Poisson's ratio, reflectance, shear strength, specific gravity, electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, tensile strength, yield strength, Young's modulus, and/or fracture toughness. Chemical compounds can be formed also to change the sintering temperature, surface porosity, and color, and, of particular importance in implantable lead to improve biocompatibility.",
                        "It is contemplated that in some forms of the invention, the liquid crystal polymer fibers or the lead implant itself may be coated with gold or other biocompatible metal (such as, for example, platinum) using either vacuum coating, sputtering, ion beam assisted/induced deposition, cathodic arc deposition, electrospray and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization. This can help to disperse the conductive phase in the polymer or liquid crystal polymer.",
                        "The lead wire has abrupt variations in resistance over its length which can prevent undesirable RF heating from occurring at the ends of the leads. This means the improved leads may be implanted, used for treatment in DBS systems or the like, and moreover imaged at the currently contraindicated MR operating conditions for existing leads. As one example, when the lead is implanted in a patient and subjected to radio frequency waves in an MRI device, the lead may not heat more than 2 degrees Centigrade in an applied field of 3 Telsa.",
                        "The lead may also have a packaging similar to existing leads (for example, may be approximately 1.3 mm in diameter). An insulating outer coating, such as a polyurethane coating, may be received on the lead wire. The lead may include multiple bundles (for example, four bundles), in which each bundle includes a lead wire that with an insulating outer coating, and these multiple bundles are packaged together in a single lead. In this instance, each of the multiple bundles may be received in additional liquid crystal polymer (to strengthen the lead) and may have an insulating sheathing for insulation as well as biocompatibility.",
                        "Based on the disclosed design, the lead wire may be adapted to conduct direct current for deep brain stimulation treatment, while remaining substantially transparent in clinically-applicable MR environments, including those which are currently contraindicated but highly valuable for treatment of patients.",
                        "According to one aspect, a deep brain stimulation device is provided including a neurostimulator, an electrode, and a lead (as described above or elsewhere in this disclosure) in which the lead places the neurostimulator and the electrode in electrical communication with one another.",
                        "However, it will be appreciated that the lead might be useable in other non-DBS systems such as, for example, pacemakers. Other applications may include, but are not limited to: functional electrical stimulation used in spinal cord injury, back pain and stroke; median nerve stimulation used in epilepsy; cortical stimulation used in epilepsy, brain computer interface and to promote awakening from vegetative state or coma; sub-epidermal Electric Stimulator Implant for migraine; occipital nerve stimulation for occipital neuralgia and chronic migraines; neuromodulation for managing urinary function or to control chronic pain and Sacral nerve stimulation to control the bladder; cochlear implants, gastric neurostimulator implant; and implantable bone growth stimulation.",
                        "According to yet another aspect, an MR-compatible lead is disclosed generally in which a lead wire includes a polymer (which may be a LCP or another biocompatible polymer such as for example, but not limited to, PEEK, PAI, PEI, PPSU, POM and implantable grade ultra high molecular weight polyethylene which all are currently approved for long-term implantation) with a conductive phase (either particles dispersed therein or a conductive coating on a sheet that is rolled as described below). Again, the lead may be able to transmit a direct current signal while being substantially MR transparent in clinically applicable MR environments.",
                        "According to still another aspect, a method of making a lead is disclosed. A liquid crystal polymer and conductive particles are mixed to form a mixture in which the conductive particles are dispersed in the liquid crystal polymer and, from the mixture, a lead wire is formed. This forming may involve, in some embodiments, extruding the mixture to similarly orient fibers of the liquid crystal polymer in a direction of extrusion.",
                        "It is contemplated that the improved lead may not be limited to conductive particles dispersed in a liquid crystal polymer, but may include other polymers. These polymers may include, but are not limited to, PEEK, PAI, PEI, PPSU, POM and implantable grade ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. Likewise, the conductive phase may not be limited to conductive nanoparticles of gold and carbon, but may include (but are not limited to) gold, platinum, titanium, niobium, tantalum, cobalt-chromium, cobalt, stainless steel, chromium and zirconium.",
                        "According to one embodiment, a wire may be built from a wrapped up, rolled up, or coiled thin sheet of polymeric material. In one form, the sheet may be approximately 25 microns thick. This rolled design is also workable because the DBS electrode needs to be stiff and it is a straight lead. The polymer sheet is transformed into a conductor before it is coiled by either dispersing fine non-ferromagnetic, biocompatible and conductive particles into a molten form of the sheet or by coating the sheet. Coating may be performed either by vacuum coating or by applying a fine non-ferromagnetic, biocompatible and conductive medium that is then cured leaving a conductive surface. This deposited coating creates a \u201cprimer\u201d layer and conductivity can then be controlled by building up thickness by resistance or timing controlled electrical metal fine non-ferromagnetic, biocompatible and conductive electro plating. Different metals or carbon can be used in electroplating with different conductivity to match the different RTS layers. The metals may include: gold, platinum, titanium, niobium, tantalum, cobalt-chromium, cobalt, stainless steel, chromium and zirconium.",
                        "These and other advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the description below and the accompanying drawings. While a preferred embodiment is described and depicted, it should be understood that this disclosure is not made by way of limitation."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "As outlined above, both electromagnetic simulations in human head models with implants and case studies have shown that traditional leads implanted in the brain can produce local heating during magnetic resonance imaging.",
                        "To overcome the problems with existing leads, in this disclosure, we present new neural prosthetic leads that can be used as MR-conditional intracranial implants in human subjects. These leads, which may be used in DBS systems or the like, are based on resistive tapered striplines (RTS) technology such as is found in the literature. See, for example, Bonmassar G. \u201cResistive Tapered Stripline (RTS) in Electroencephalogram Recordings During MRI.\u201d IEEE Trans on Microw Theory and Tech. 2004; 52(8):1992-8. The RTS-type lead design reduces the RF-induced currents along the DBS implant as well as the related increase of RF power deposition and potential tissue heating near the tip of the leads. As used herein, the improved leads may be referred to, for example, as \u201cRTS leads,\u201d \u201cLCP leads,\u201d \u201cDBS leads\u201d, or simply \u201cleads.\u201d In the instance in which the improved leads are being compared to conventional leads, or are being prototyped, it will be so indicated by the context of the detailed description.",
                        "The principle behind the RTS design can be best understood by recalling oceanic science, where standing waves (called clapotis) are sometimes formed. Special constructions called caisson-type breakwaters have been reinforced with wide rubble-mound beams to break up wave energy over some distance, preventing the formation of clapotis.",
                        "Similarly, the disclosed design incorporates a lead with abrupt variation of resistance along its length, which essentially breaks up the energy of the RF wave in the wire by scattering. Specifically, this disclosed design embeds RF transparency in a conductive liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and modifies it with a tapered dielectric structure in the form of nanoparticles. In some specific forms, the LCP material can have a high tensile strength and is up to five times stronger than the current leads, which occasionally fracture. Prototypes of these DBS leads can be built using current bench-level polymer thick film (PTF) technology.",
                        "The RTS leads are divided into segments with different unmatched impedances that allow reflecting back to the input parts of the incoming RF emitted from the MR transmit coil, thereby minimizing RF deposition into the patient. Conversely, the RTS-type structure reduces the low-frequency resistance (that is, the real part of the impedance) to preserve the battery life of the neurostimulator. The RTS-type structure of the leads allows for very low overall DC resistance of the leads using the novel materials and thus the novel DBS system will still have a standard battery life, which cannot be achieved using traditional purely resistive leads.",
                        "This improved lead design significantly impacts the neural prosthetics field by creating a new state-of-the-art lead for a medical implant that is compatible with a wider range of MRI use. As the disclosed leads achieve a high degree of RF-transparency, maintain the current DBS lead form factor, and containing only minimal amount of metal, this allows for the scanning of patients even under very broad conditions, presently absolutely contraindicated. These conditions include: the use MRI in normal operating mode (whole-body SAR of 2 W/kg, whole-head SAR of 3.2 W/kg), the use of 3 T or higher static fields, the use of RF transmit body coil, and the use of multichannel transmit coils.",
                        "This allows patients with DBS implants to benefit from the complete diagnostic benefits of MRI, including for example disease diagnosis in body soft tissues. This will have a high-impact on public health because, while MRI and non-soft tissue CT examinations are ranked by physicians as the most important technologies affecting their ability to treat patients, currently less than 5% of the patients with DBS benefit from MRI, and even then only a partial MRI given the recited restrictions on use.",
                        "It is contemplated that besides the FDA approved applications of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and obsessive compulsive disorder, the proposed leads implementing RTS technology may be employed in future clinical applications of DBS including major depressive disorder, disorder and epilepsy and potentially, with further testing, in other active implants such as cardiac pacemakers which are implanted in hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide.",
                        "Moreover, the disclosed leads may offer other benefits unrelated to their improved MRI compatibility. For, example, these leads may be less susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external RF sources such as for example, metal detectors, anti-theft systems and communication systems (for example, cell phones, RF towers).",
                        "Referring particularly to FIG. 2, a DBS system 10 is illustrated including an electrode probe 12 that is capable of both stimulating populations of neurons and measuring single-unit neuronal activity. The probe 12 is typically implanted in a targeted area, for example, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and connected to an insulated lead 14 that is passed under the skin of the head, neck, and shoulder and terminated at a neurostimulator 16. The neurostimulator 16 typically sits inferior to the clavicle and is programmed to operate the DBS system 10. A pulse generator 18, a controller 20, and battery pack 22 that powers the apparatus are all included in the neurostimulator 16.",
                        "Still referring to FIG. 2, in operation, the DBS system 10 acquires neuronal activity, or spike train, data with the electrode probe 12. This neuronal activity data is carried via the lead 14 to the neurostimulator 16 where it is processed by the controller 20. The controller 20 analyzes this data and predicts a responsive stimulation signal that will prevent future pathological neural events. The stimulation signal is generated by the pulse generator 18 and delivered via the lead 14 to the electrode probe 12, which administers the stimulation signal to the targeted area. It is contemplated that the response may inhibit the neuron, excite the neuron, or do nothing.",
                        "Turning now to FIG. 3, the LCP material is illustrated for the improved lead design. The LCP fiber in this instance is a polyesterpolyarylate fiber belonging to the class of aromatic polyesters and its chemical structure is illustrated in FIG. 3C. The fiber is based on HBA/HNA (that is, p-hydroxybenzoic/phydroxynapthodic acids) copolyesters, prepared by melt polymerization at 250\u00b0-280\u00b0 for 4 hours. Comparing FIGS. 3A to 3B, the oriented LCP fibers are shown in comparison to randomly distributed polyester molecules. The LCP fibers possess unique properties, such as: high strength for mechanically biostable leads, excellent creep resistance to ensure long life of the chronic implants, high abrasion resistance to sustain the repetitive wire linear motion during subject's movement, excellent flex/fold characteristics optimal for bending reliability as will be outlined below, minimal moisture absorption for avoiding leaking/corrosion and improving biostability, excellent chemical resistance for biocompatibility, low coefficient of thermal expansion for lead fabrication, high dielectric strength for insulation (notable, since conductive particles will be mixed with the LCP fibers), outstanding cut resistance for avoiding electrical breaks in the implant lead, excellent retention properties for prolonged implant life, high impact resistance, and good shock absorbance for reducing potential neuroprosthetics leads damage during accidents. LCP fibers orientated as in FIG. 3A are five times stronger than steel and ten times stronger than aluminum. Outgassing tests show that LCP fibers perform well within parameters for medical applications including DBS. LCP may also offer decreased UV degradation for resilience to implant sterilization.",
                        "LCPs are extremely biocompatible given that they are exceptionally inert. LCPs are capable of withstanding most chemicals at elevated temperatures, including aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons, strong acids, bases, ketones, and so forth. Chronically implanted electrodes often can provoke an immune reaction against them. Histopathology analysis often shows gliosis and spongiosis around the electrode track, which forms an encapsulation layer referred to as a \u201cglial scar.\u201d",
                        "Since LCPs are non-conductive, a doping step with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and/or carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) is added to the melt polymerization process of the LCP manufacturing in order to produce the material for the leads and to impart the conductive qualities used in DBS treatment. It is contemplated that other conductive materials may be used and, rather than being particles dispersed in a mixture with the polymer, they may be a conductive layer formed on a thin polymeric sheet that is subsequently rolled or coiled to form a wire lead. The target conductivities may be determined using electromagnetic simulations as outlined below. Depending on size, shape, and chemical surface of AuNPs, a layer of oxidation or a protein corona may occur. The potential problem is that the water-gold reduction (2 Au+3 H2O\u2192Au2O3+3 H2) modifies the local pH and may generate inflammation in the surrounding tissue or by other mechanisms that ultimately may prompt an immune reaction.",
                        "Since any chemical element is toxic at high dose, it will be established that AuNPs and CNPs are not toxic at the low concentration at which they may leak in the tissue. A recent review suggests that AuNPs are biocompatible at low dose, as they are being evaluated as neurological drug delivery agents in clinical trials. Similarly, CNPs are considered safe in humans as they have been used in electrodes for decades (carbon black). To further ensure the biocompatibility of the proposed fibers, the AuNPs and CNPs are tested for biocompatibility in rats by the Charles River Laboratories International (CRL), Inc., Wilmington Mass. to test that the RTS leads do not have a worse glial scar/immune response when compared to the polyurethane used in the commercial DBS sets.",
                        "A numerical framework based on a combination of Finite Differences Time Domain (FDTD) and Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations are used to optimize the design of the RTS leads. Anatomically precise head models with implanted DBS leads with a multiscale resolution of 1-0.1 mm3 isotropic have been developed which allow for accurate geometrical modeling of the implanted leads as well as precise computation of 1 g- and 10 g-averaged SAR. The FDTD simulations have been validated with temperature measurements and have been shown to provide accuracy of 20% as predicted by the bioheat equation for whole-body SAR and phantom. However, the use of the whole-head SAR or even 10 g-averaged SAR as dosimetric parameter for safety profile with thin-wire (PEC) such as the RTS leads may be potentially inaccurate and local SAR should be considered instead. The bioheat equation predicts that minimizing the local SAR is equivalent to minimizing the tissue heating. The underlying assumption of lack of perfusion used for in vitro study represents a worst-case scenario for temperature changes at the distal tip and related tissue injury. Thus, the in-vitro temperature measurements are currently the only reliable safety validation tool with metallic implants as shown by several groups and are used to confirm the RTS simulations. FDTD simulations are performed using different number of RTS layers and the simulation is coupled with an optimization algorithm in FEM to estimate the ideal RTS parameters for each layer, such as length and conductivity.",
                        "The final optimization result of the combined FDTD/FEM simulations provides the specifications to build the leads using the PTF technology available at the Analog Brain Imaging Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. The leads are tested at field strengths of 0.5 T, 1 T, 1.5 T and 3 T on the gold standard head and torso phantom specified by ASTM (ASTM 2182-11). Temperature measurements are performed with fluoroptic temperature probes, extensively used by the scientific community for use in MRI. Based on the simulations and prototype PTF leads, LCP fibers with RTS layers are then produced, by changing the concentration of AuNPs and CNPs as similarly done with the prototype PTF leads.",
                        "The overall resistance of each lead is preferably below 25% of the maximum electrodes/tissue contact impedance of the DBS system or more preferably below 10%. Additionally, the battery life of the simulator should preferably be able to last at least six months using the new lead design.",

However, MRI artifacts may arise if the gold nanoparticles are contaminated by ferromagnetic metals. To confirm the lack of ferromagnetic contaminants in the gold nanoparticles prior to lead fabrication, the nanoparticles may be tested first using MRI, for example."

All traces were silk screen printed on top of a Melinex\u00ae polyester film substrate (obtained from DuPont Teijin Films of Chester, Va.) using two different sets of conductive ink mixtures each having its own dielectric ink layer on top. The two sets were based on a different binder system, namely on a two parts epoxy for the first set (set #1) and acrylic for the second set (set #2).

The stripline measurements were not direct since they also measure the effect of the Melinex\u00ae film substrate and the dielectric ink. At 128 MHz (that is, the frequency corresponding to 3 T) both sets show a similar decrease: set #1 decreased of 104\u03a9 and set #2 decreased of 103\u03a9. The average variance of the resistivity (not shown) of both sets was 65.2 \u03a92 and 80.3 \u03a92. As shown in FIGS. 6A, 6B, 6D, and 6E, all stripline sets showed similar resistive and reactive loads. The impedance of a capacitor is 1/(j\u03c9C), so the reactance or the imaginary part of the impedance changes as \u22121/(\u03c9C) and both sets followed this law. The average reactance variance (not shown) of sets #1 and #2 were 49.5 and 36. FIG. 6C illustrates the measured return loss which is the difference, in dB, between forward and reflected power measured with the Agilent 16093/A binding post fixture and it does not vary with the power level at which it is measured (all the measurements were performed at 0 dBm). The Smith Chart results, illustrated in FIG. 6F (and is similar for both sets), suggest that all traces have a capacitance of approximately 10 pF estimated by the capacitance of a stripline. Because all the measurements shared the same Melinex\u00ae film, it can be deduced that all inks have very similar electrical permittivity of the dielectric, which is most likely the binder used for both the conductive and the dielectric inks."

The LCP-based RTS lead design is based on the PTF prototype built with conductive inks, where Carbon/Gold ink is formed as a suspension of CNPs/AuNPs encapsulated in a liquid resin called PTF filler, except that instead C/Au nanoparticles are mixed in the LCP filler. The same nanoparticles may be used as in the PTF prototype, since they provide optimal bonding binder: AuNPs of average size of 4-5 \u03bcm and largest spheres of approximately 14 \u03bcm and CNPs with average size less than 1 \u03bcm (such as are used in the CMI inks for the PTF prototype). LCP molecules have been shown to bond well with gold and LCP electrically conductive fibers are already commercially available (for example, Vectra A230D-3 from Ticona of Florence, Ky.).",

The Au/LCP mixture is tested in an MRI to test for the presence of ferromagnetic metals that would produce imaging artifacts if the ferromagnetic metals are present. In order to avoid potential complications with clogging the capillary holes during extrusion, only large (approximately 100 \u03bcm) LCP fiber diameter are considered for manufacturing. Each fiber with the desired conductivity is aligned with a microscope and heat bonded to produce the final desired RTS fibers and are bundled and insulated with polyurethane as in the Medtronic DBS 3387. Polyurethane has excellent properties of moisture barrier, insulation and biocompatibility.",

Before implanting the intracortical electrodes, each monkey is scanned using a Siemens 3 T MR scanner to acquire data for stereotactical registration. Each monkey is initially implanted with a plastic headpost and recording/stimulation channel, using ceramic screws covered by dental acrylic. This surgery is performed under general anesthesia by delivering isoflurane (1.5%)/N2O (50%)/O2 (50%). Temperature and CO2 are monitored during anesthesia for the well-being of the animal and continuous saline solution will be administrated intravenously.

The behavioral performance at different onset times is studied to confirm that the new leads are delivering the stimulus, by comparing RT, MT and MA on the two monkeys with RTS in comparison to the two monkeys with the standard DBS set.",

Furthermore, the voxels around the implant are segmented to extract scar borders and thinning as done to compare the lesion volumes, cross sectional areas and thickness in the two conditions. The histological statistical image processing is performed using a Bayesian analysis on the co-registered (commercial versus RTS) segmented images and the Cohen's kappa coefficient is estimated to measure the agreement of the raw digital images from CRL.

The RTS design attenuates the antenna performance and reduces the induced current at the electrode by introducing scattering within the implant. The optimal RTS design parameters have been studied by electromagnetic simulations, showing a 37-fold reduction in induced current at the electrode when compared to a metallic wire. Experimental temperature measurements with a 3 T MRI system and battery testing with a commercial DBS implantable pulse generator were performed. Measurement results showed that the heating near the electrode of the RTS prototype was less than 2\u00b0 C. compared to 9\u00b0 C. obtained with a commercially available DBS lead. There were no significant differences in battery consumption between the two leads over a one-month period. The potential impact of RTS design is highly significant to medical research and patient health care as the new technology may allow an increasing number of patients with active implants access to standard diagnostic medicine.",
                                "As noted above in the background section, implanted medical devices such as cardioverter-defibrillators, pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, and deep brain stimulators have become well-adopted therapeutic options to treat a large range of medical ailments and contribute to improve quality of life. Many patients with implanted devices may benefit from MRI, which is the diagnostic tool of choice for monitoring structural changes in the body as well as diagnosing many common disorders including cancer, cardiovascular disease and trauma. Additionally, functional MRI is becoming more dominant in assessing brain function and cognitive disorder. However, approximately 300,000 patients with implanted or partially implanted medical devices are denied MRI each year because of safety concerns. A major concern when performing MRI examinations in patients with electrically conductive implants is the high induced currents (\u201cantenna effect\u201d) along the conductive lead exposed to the radiofrequency (RF) waves of the MRI. These high currents flow into the tissue at the point of contact with the lead (i.e., the distal electrodes) causing a large amount of RF energy to be absorbed in the tissue which, in turn, causes surges in temperatures that may lead to serious injury. Temperature increases of up to 25\u00b0 C. near DBS electrodes have been measured with an in-vitro gel phantom at 1.5 Tesla MRI. Additionally, increases of up to 30\u00b0 C. were measured in a pig at 9.4 Tesla. Still yet, two cases of serious, permanent neurological injury after MRI exposure at 1.0 Tesla in patients with DBS implants have been reported. In the most severe case, when manufacturer guidelines were not followed, a patient with bilateral DBS implants underwent MRI and suffered an edema near one of the implants with a consequent paralysis. The accidents associated with implants and MRI are expensive to society due to treatment that often includes hospitalization.",

Nevertheless, there are drawbacks even for MR Conditional devices. For example, the conditions under which a patient with an implanted MR Conditional DBS system can safely undergo MRI are extremely restrictive and exclude the most commonly used transmit body coils, the 3 T systems, and the state-of-the-art MRI multichannel transmit coils, which represents a significant constraint to the use of MRI for many patients with DBS.",
                                "To solve the issue of RF-induced heating without interfering with device performance, several proposals have been made to modify the design of the implant such as introducing RF chokes, modifying the materials of the lead, or utilizing special geometrical paths for the wire. Herein, a new type of lead based on RTS technology is utilized. The RTS design can be best understood by recalling oceanic science, where an area of study is the prevention of standing waves (\u201cclapotis\u201d). Special constructions reinforced with wide rubble-mound beams break up wave energy over some distance, preventing the formation of clapotis. Similarly, tapered dielectric structures can break up or scatter RF energy due to their unique frequency response characteristics.",
                                "In FIG. 12A, a two-section stripline-based design is presented with an abrupt variation of electrical conductivity along its length. Contrary to a standard electrically homogeneous cylindrical wire, this design can break up the induced current along the lead caused by the MRI RF coil. Subsequently, RF induced current along the RTS lead would be more heterogeneously distributed as illustrated by FIG. 12B and significantly reduced at the distal electrode. This in turn causes a reduction of energy absorption in the tissue surrounding the electrode.",
                                "There are various advantages to this RTS design. Numerical simulations and experimental testing confirmed that the RTS design allows for \u201cRF-transparency\u201d while maintaining proper conductivity as not to affect battery performance. Additionally, as shown from previous studies, a Polymer Thick Film (PTF) design may produce lower T1, T2 and T2* MRI artifacts since in general it contains less metal than conventional implants. Finally, this RTS design does not require any external physical device such as a RF choke. RF chokes are difficult to attach to an implant wire because the dimensions of a choke are larger than the typical dimension of the wire. In addition, chokes disrupt the mechanical characteristics of an implant wire, which should remain flexible. Although there are extremely miniaturized RF chokes, these devices are more prone to burn because of the physical dimensions, thereby causing additional surgeries to explant and re-implant a device just to replace a burnt RF choke.",

Experimental testing includes measuring temperature changes near the device while implanted in gel-type material that simulates electrical and thermal characteristics of the human body. Additionally, computational modeling has been increasingly used to complement experimental testing, as it allows for extensive, cost-effective and systematic analysis of several variables that can influence the amount of current flow into an implant and the amount of energy absorbed by surrounding tissue.",

Simulations were utilized to determine the values of electrical conductivity and length for a two-section RTS design that was then used to build a prototype for experimental validation. The prototype was then implanted in a gel-filled phantom and tested in a 3 T MRI system.

M., Staubert, A., Hahnel, S. & Sarem-Aslani, A. Magnetic resonance imaging with implanted neurostimulators: an in vitro and in vivo study. Neurosurgery 44, 118-125 (1999). The initial value of the tuning capacitance was estimated and adjusted until the unloaded coil system was tuned to 128 MHz. The correct coil mode was identified by first tuning the coil to a resonant mode and then plotting the resultant current distribution in HFSS to ensure a sinusoidal distribution of current in the rungs of the coil as per Li, H., Li, L. & Toh, K.-A. Advanced topics in biometrics. (World Scientific, 2012). The value of capacitance for each identical capacitor located around the rings of the high-pass birdcage was found to be 13.5 pF. Each capacitor also includes an approximated 0.05\u03a9 of equivalent series resistance which was estimated. The input voltage to the coil was adjusted in the circuit simulator to set a whole-body averaged SAR within the phantom of 2.0 W/kg (i.e., Normal Operating Mode for MRI systems). The input voltage was found to be approximately 115V. The complex magnitude of the electric field was calculated in the phantom under these conditions for the purpose of determining the area of peak electric field. FIG. 18 shows a 3D plot of the magnitude of the electric field at the Larmor frequency f0=128 MHz at a power level yielding whole-body SAR of 2 W/kg within the phantom. This field plot helps to visualize the target locations of peak values of electric field, where the lead was placed. An asymmetry in the field due to the circular polarization and the shape of the ASTM phantom can be seen with peaks located laterally across the anterior and posterior sides of the phantom. Once this area of peak electric field was located, a model of a conductive ink stripline lead was placed in this location as shown in FIG. 18. For each lead design simulation, the 10 g-avg.

Simulations were performed using Finite Element Method, which allowed for a high spatial resolution at the distal electrode, where the highest electric field was observed. The accuracy of the simulations was subsequently validated against in-vitro temperature measurements in a gel-filled phantom, discussed below. Notably, the simulations and manufacturing were performed with the distal electrode exposed only on a single side, although additional simulations included the case of two exposed tips providing the data illustrated in FIG. 17. The single side opening is the most realistic case, because the proximal end is typically connected to an impulse generator, which usually includes RF chokes necessary to protect the internal circuitry from damage by external large RF fields. Compared to standard leads in both simulations and in-vitro testing, the RTS showed that the proposed design successfully reduces the inductance of the lead and breaks the current along the lead, reducing the amount of energy absorbed at the distal electrode and the related temperature changes inside the gel-phantom.",

The total length for all the designs was L=40 cm, to match standard lead designs per the search limitations identified above. As illustrated in FIG. 14B, the specific length of each of the two sections of the RTS lead was shown to non-linearly affect the 10 g-averaged SAR at the distal electrode. This analysis was performed by sweeping each trace across the same values of length, but with different values of the ratio in conductivity (\u03c31/\u03c32) between the two sections of the lead. FIG. 14C shows the 10 g-averaged SAR in the phantom near the distal electrode with a resistance sweep from 0\u03a9 to 1 k\u03a9 for several RTS designs. The RTS lead reduced the 10 g-averaged SAR across the entire range of possible resistances. The simulations showed that an increase in conductivity ratio between the two sections corresponded to a decrease in 10 g-average SAR at the distal electrode. For example, the optimal RTS (that is, \u03c31/\u03c32=200) plateaued at 400\u03a9 with a value of 4.02 W/Kg, whereas the design with \u03c31/\u03c32=2 showed a 10 g-avg.SAR of 5.75 W/Kg at 400\u03a9. With reference being made to FIG. 14D, the SAR reduction was due to a lower inductance of the RTS design that corresponded to a shorter equivalent antenna length and lower induced currents. As confirmed by the simulations, the RTS design was characterized by a reduced current at the distal electrode of over two orders of magnitude. Based on the constraints on the electrical conductivity of the ink used for manufacturing, one RTS configuration was selected to build a prototype with the following characteristics: \u03c31=1.968\u00b7106S/m, \u03c32=25.61\u00b7103S/m (i.e., \u03c31/\u03c32=76.86), L1=0.367 m, and L2=0.033 m. The total resistance for the RTS design was chosen to be R=400\u03a9, five times less than the maximum electrode/tissue impedance of 2 k\u03a9 allowed by even older IPG models. As shown in FIG. 14B, the 10 g-SAR of this configuration was expected to be very similar to the best performance of the RTS lead with ratio \u03c31/\u03c32=200 (i.e., 4.1 W/kg vs. 4.02 W/kg, respectively).",

The carbon-based ink, which is significantly lower in conductivity, was mixed with the silver based ink to adjust the conductivity of the second section to the desired value indicated by the simulations. The length of the most conductive layer was given by the conductivity of the silver ink and a length that allowed for a less conductive layer with target ratio \u03c31/\u03c32=77, giving the overall resistivity of 400\u03a9. Notably, the resistivity of both the carbon traces and silver electrodes is flat between 100 Hz to 200 MHz. The 400\u03a9 resistance was well within the range of current commercial IPGs considering that the contact electrode/tissue resistance is usually below 1 k\u03a9.

                                "The testing was performed using the following parameter settings for Medtronic Activa PC IPG: i) single lead (contact 0) set to negative (\u2212), ii) case set to positive (+ and contacts 1, 2 and 3 were all turned off), iii) unipolar cathodic pulse train set to an amplitude of 2V, a frequency of 130 Hz and a pulse width of 90 \u03bcs. For the Medtronic 3389 lead the following procedure was used: the extension wire was connected and fastened (with set screw) to the Activa PC IPG, the 3389 lead was connected and fastened to extension wire; the connection site was covered with silicon wrap and sealed on both ends with non-dissolvable suture, which is the same procedure utilized in the operating room to produce a water tight implant. For the RTS lead, the following procedure was used: the extension wire connected and fastened (with set screw) to Activa PC IPG and the RTS lead connected to (contact 0) on the extension wire with silver epoxy (8331, MG Chemicals, Surrey. B.C., Canada) and insulated with super glue; the connection site was covered with silicon wrap and sealed on both ends with non-dissolvable suture. A Digital multimeter was used to check for conductivity between RTS contact and extension wire.",
                                "For both leads, the IPG, extension and lead were then placed in a quart of deionized water and saline solution was added to deionized water until impedance measured 1500\u03a9. A hand held Medtronic Physician programmer was utilized to activate the IPG to test for therapeutic impedance. The IPG was turned on and left on for a total of four weeks; during this time the IPG was tested once a week for two measures, 1) an oscilloscope was used to check and measure emitted pulse train in saline solution, and 2) the hand held programmer was used to monitor changes in therapeutic impedance. Saline was added to the water if impedance dropped below 1500 \u03a9.",
                                "The results demonstrate that the high resistivity of the RTS lead does not compromise the power consumption of the Medtronic Activa IPG. Furthermore, finding that the RTS lead battery level profile was the same as the Medtronic lead provides confidence that the low power dissipation material used in the RTS is suitable for chronic implantation since it will not reduce the advertised nine years battery life.",
                                "While several embodiments have been described and disclosed, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other changes can be made as well. Therefore, the present invention is not to be limited to just the described most preferred embodiments. Hence, to ascertain the full scope of the invention, the claims which follow should also be referenced."
