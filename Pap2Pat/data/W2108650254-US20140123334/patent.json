    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a method of increasing resistance against plant pathogens, particularly Phytophthora and Fusarium virguliforme in transgenic plants and/or plant cells, through the use of non host resistance nucleic acid molecules isolated from Arabidopsis. In these plants, at least one nonhost Arabidopsis resistance protein is introduced in comparison to the wild-type plants to confer resistance to plant pathogens. The invention relates to transgenic plants and/or plant cells having an increased resistance against plant pathogens particularly Phytophthora and Fusarium virguliforme to expression vectors, transformed plants and plant cells as well as the use of such plants in a plant breeding program.",

                        "Soybean [Glycine max L. (Merrill)] is a major oil seed crop and is grown throughout much of the world. The United States alone produces over half of the world output. Soybean seed typically contains 40% protein and 20% oil and is used primarily for livestock feed and industrial purposes, in addition to human consumption. In North America, soybean suffers yield loss from the root and stem rot disease caused by oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae. Phytophthora sojae (Kauffman & Gerdemann) is an oomycete pathogen which causes extensive damage to roots and stems of soybean plants (Glycine max) (Zhang et al., MPMI, 19:1302-1310 (2006)). Symptoms of Phytophthora Root Rot (PRR) caused by P. sojae include yellowing and wilting of leaves and browning of lower stems and branches (Demirbas et al., Crop Sci. 41:1220-1227 (2001)). In the United States the annual crop losses from this disease were valued to about 0.2-0.3 billion dollars (Wrather et al. 2001) Annual worldwide soybean crop losses amount to $1 to $2 billion (Zhang et al., MPMI, 19: 1302-1310 (2006)). Plant resistance to this and other sort of pathogens present a major problem to soybean growers.",
                        "Resistance generally means the ability of a plant to prevent, or at least curtail the infestation and colonization by a harmful pathogen. Different mechanisms can be discerned in the naturally occurring resistance, with which the plants fend off colonization by phytopathogenic organisms. These specific interactions between the pathogen and the host determine the course of infection (Schopfer and Brennicke (1999) Pflanzenphysiologie, Springer Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg, Germany).",
                        "With regard to race specific resistance, also called host resistance, a differentiation is made between compatible and incompatible interactions. In the compatible interaction, an interaction occurs between a virulent pathogen and a susceptible plant. The pathogen survives, and may build up reproduction structures, while the host dies off. An incompatible interaction occurs on the other hand when the pathogen infects the plant but is inhibited in its growth before or after weak development of symptoms. In the latter case, the plant is resistant to the respective pathogen (Schopfer and Brennick, vide supra). In both compatible and incompatible interactions a defensive and specific reaction of the host to the pathogen occurs.",
                        "In nature, however, this host resistance is often overcome because of the rapid evolutionary development of pathogens (Neu et al. (2003) American Cytopathol. Society, MPMI 16 No. 7: 626-633). In contrast, non-host resistance offers strong, broad, and permanent protection from phytopathogens. Non-host resistance relates to the phenomenon where a pathogen can induce a disease in a certain plant species, but not in other plant species (Heath (2002) Can. J. Plant Pathol. 24: 259-264).",
                        "Despite this interesting characteristic, the genetic and molecular biological basis for nonhost resistance have up to now only been poorly understood. There are indications that non-host resistance is induced by unspecific agents, and also that individual pathogen proteins induce the non-host resistance reaction (Heath (1981) Phytopathology 71: 1121-1123; Heath (2001) Physiol. Mol. Plant. Pathol. 58: 53-54; Kamoun et al. (1998) Plant Cell 10: 1413-1425; Lauge et al. (2000) Plant J. 23: 735-745; Whalen et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 6743-6747). The phenomenon of non-host resistance might also be based on structural or chemical properties of the plant species, such as the thickness of the cuticle or the presence of inhibitory substances.",

These sequences alone, or in combination with other sequences, can be used to improve the resistance in susceptible plant species such as soybean to Phytophthora. In another aspect of the present invention, expression cassettes and transformation vectors comprising the isolated nucleotide sequences are disclosed. The transformation vectors can be used to transform plants and express these pathogen non host resistance genes in the transformed cells. Transformed cells as well as regenerated transgenic plants and seeds containing and expressing the isolated DNA sequences and protein products are also provided.",
                        "Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention relates to an isolated nucleic acid comprising an isolated polynucleotide sequence encoding a non-host resistance gene product isolated from Arabeopsis that confers its non-host resistance. Several non-host resistance genes have been identified according to the invention, including At5g64600 (O-fucosyltrasnferase protein) (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2, and 19); At5g65900 (DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 27) (SEQ ID NOS 3, 4, and 20); At5g66380 (folate transporter 1, or FOLT1) (SEQ ID NOS: 3, 4, and 21); At3g59640 (glycine-rich protein) (SEQ ID NOS 7,8, and 22); At3g59650 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L51/S25/Cl-B8 protein) (SEQ ID NOS 9, 10, and 23); At3g60310 (protein of unknown function) (SEQ ID NOS 11. 12.

Sequences reported above are non-limiting examples of potential coding sequences of these genes recited herein and are reported as CDS, amino acid, and genomic respectively.",
                        "In a further aspect, the present invention includes a nucleic acid selected from: (a) an isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention; (b) a polynucleotide having at least 90% or 95% identity to a polynucleotide of the present invention; (c) a polynucleotide comprising at least 50 or more nucleotides in length which hybridizes under high stringency conditions to a polynucleotide of the present invention; (d) a polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention; and (e) a polynucleotide which is complementary to the polynucleotide of (a) to (e). The present invention includes and provides a method of investigating an haplotype of a plant comprising: (A) isolating nucleic acid molecules from the plant; (B) determining the nucleic acid sequence of a nonhost resistance gene; and, (C) comparing the nucleic acid sequence of the allele or part thereof to a reference nucleic acid sequence. The present invention includes and provides a method of introgressing Phytophthora resistance or partial Phytophthora resistance into a susceptible plant comprising: performing marker assisted selection of the plant with a nucleic acid marker, wherein the nucleic acid marker specifically hybridizes with a nucleic acid molecule encoding a non host resistance gene reported herein and, selecting the plant based on the marker assisted selection.",

Additionally, the present invention relates to a vector containing the recombinant expression cassette. Further, the vector containing the recombinant expression cassette can facilitate the transcription and translation of the nucleic acid in a host cell. The present invention also relates to host cells able to express the polynucleotide of the present invention. A number of host cells could be used, such as but not limited to, microbial, mammalian, plant, or insect. Thus the invention is also directed to transgenic cells, containing the nucleic acids of the present invention as well as cells, plants, tissue cultures and ultimately lines derived therefrom. The invention also relates to vectors and cassettes designed to introduce the expression of nonhost resistance proteins for modulation of the Phytophthora interaction, or for delineation of information about the regulatory pathways involving the same.",
                        "This invention also provides an isolated polypeptide comprising (a) a polypeptide comprising at least 90% or 95% sequence identity to a polypeptide of the present invention (b) a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid of the present invention; and (c) a polypeptide comprising a nonhost resistance activity and comprising conserved structural domain motifs of the same.",
                        "Another embodiment of the subject invention comprises methods for engineering broad-spectrum pathogen resistance in soybean or other Phytophthora susceptible crop plants by introducing nonhost resistance protein encoding sequences to said plants. Plants' tolerance to Phytophthora and other soybean pathogens may be improved by elucidating the pathways that regulate gene transcription involved in enhancing accumulation of products shown to be associated with expression of other pathogen resistance, methods for providing for increased nonspecific resistance to particularly virulent races or strains of pathogenic agents including P. sojae, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycenia (Psg), soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Fusarium virguliforme or soybean mosaic virus.",
                        "Nucleotide sequences isolated from the nonhost resistance genes which may be introduced to plants can be used in developing perfect molecular markers that can be routinely used in breeding programs for incorporating Phytophthora resistance into new cultivars.",

                        "The term \u201cconservatively modified variants\u201d applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refer to those nucleic acids which encode identical or conservatively modified variants of the amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations\u201d and represent one species of conservatively modified variation. Every nucleic acid sequence herein that encodes a polypeptide also, by reference to the genetic code, describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of ordinary skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine; and UGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide of the present invention is implicit in each described polypeptide sequence and is within the scope of the present invention.",
                        "As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \u201cconservatively modified variant\u201d where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Thus, any number of amino acid residues selected from the group of integers consisting of from 1 to 15 can be so altered. Thus, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 10 alterations can be made. Conservatively modified variants typically provide similar biological activity as the unmodified polypeptide sequence from which they are derived. For example, substrate specificity, enzyme activity, or ligand/receptor binding is generally at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the native protein for its native substrate. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art.",

A nucleic acid encoding a protein may comprise non-translated sequences (e.g., introns) within translated regions of the nucleic acid, or may lack such intervening non-translated sequences (e.g., as in cDNA). The information by which a protein is encoded is specified by the use of codons. Typically, the amino acid sequence is encoded by the nucleic acid using the \u201cuniversal\u201d genetic code. However, variants of the universal code, such as are present in some plant, animal, and fungal mitochondria, the bacterium Mycoplasma capricolum, or the ciliate Macronucleus, may be used when the nucleic acid is expressed therein.",
                        "When the nucleic acid is prepared or altered synthetically, advantage can be taken of known codon preferences of the intended host where the nucleic acid is to be expressed. For example, although nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be expressed in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, sequences can be modified to account for the specific codon preferences and GC content preferences of monocotyledons or dicotyledons as these preferences have been shown to differ (Murray et al.

Methods to determine whether a sequence is full-length are well known in the art including such exemplary techniques as northern or western blots, primer extensions, S1 protection, and ribonuclease protection. See, e.g., Plant Molecular Biology: A Laboratory Manual, Clark, Ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1997). Comparison to known full-length homologous (orthologous and/or paralogous) sequences can also be used to identify full-length sequences of the present invention. Additionally, consensus sequences typically present at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions of mRNA aid in the identification of a polynucleotide as full-length. For example, the consensus sequence ANNNNG, where the underlined codon represents the N-terminal methionine, aids in determining whether the polynucleotide has a complete 5\u2032 end. Consensus sequences at the 3\u2032 end, such as polyadenylation sequences, aid in determining whether the polynucleotide has a complete 3\u2032 end.",

A heterologous protein may originate from a foreign species or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its original form by deliberate human intervention.",

A non host resistance protein will reduce the disease symptoms resulting from pathogen challenge in a previously susceptible plant by at least about 2%, including but not limited to, about 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or greater. In particular embodiments, the disease symptoms resulting from pathogen challenge are reduced by non host resistance protein by at least about 5% to about 50%, at least about 10% to about 60%, at least about 30% to about 70%, at least about 40% to about 80%, or at least about 50% to about 90% or greater. Hence, the methods of the invention can be utilized to protect plants from disease, particularly those diseases that are caused by plant pathogens. Resistance may vary from a slight increase in tolerance to the effects of the pathogen (e.g., partial inhibition) to total resistance such that the plant is unaffected by the presence of the pathogen. An increased level of resistance against a particular pathogen or against a wider spectrum of pathogens may both constitute complete resistance or improved resistance.",

That is, pathogens are prevented from causing plant diseases and the associated disease symptoms, or alternatively, the disease symptoms caused by the pathogen are minimized or lessened, such as, for example, the reduction of stress and associated yield loss.",
                        "Assays that measure antipathogenic activity are commonly known in the art, as are methods to quantitate disease resistance in plants following pathogen infection. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,395, herein incorporated by reference. Such techniques include, measuring over time, the average lesion diameter, the pathogen biomass, and the overall percentage of decayed plant tissues. For example, a plant either expressing an non host resistance polypeptide shows a decrease in tissue necrosis (i.e., lesion diameter) or a decrease in plant death following pathogen challenge when compared to a control plant that was not engineered to express the nonhost resistance protein.",
                        "Alternatively, antipathogenic activity can be measured by a decrease in pathogen biomass. For example, a plant expressing non host resistance protein is challenged with a pathogen of interest. Over time, tissue samples from the pathogen-inoculated tissues are obtained and RNA is extracted. The percent of a specific pathogen RNA transcript relative to the level of a plant specific transcript allows the level of pathogen biomass to be determined. See, for example, Thomma et al. (1998) Plant Biology 95:15107-15111, herein incorporated by reference. According to the invention, the term \u201cincreased resistance\u201d (against Phytophthora sp.) is understood to mean that the transgenic plants, or plant cells, according to the invention are less vigorously, and/or less frequently, affected by Phytophthora than non-transformed wild type plants, or plant cells, which were otherwise treated in the same way (such as climate and cultivation conditions, pathogen type, etc.). According to the invention, the term \u201cwild type\u201d is to be understood as the respective non genetically modified parent organism. The penetration efficiency as well as the rate of papillae formation offer a possibility to quantify the reaction of the plant to the pathogen infestation (see examples). The term \u201cincreased resistance\u201d also comprises what is known as transient pathogen resistance, i.e. the transgenic plants, or plant cells, according to the invention have an increased pathogen resistance as compared to the respective wild type only for a limited period of time.",

The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The essential nature of such analogues of naturally occurring amino acids is that, when incorporated into a protein, that protein is specifically reactive to antibodies elicited to the same protein but consisting entirely of naturally occurring amino acids.

Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and be different in different circumstances. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing conditions, target sequences can be identified which are 100% complementary to the probe (homologous probing). Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in sequences so that lower degrees of similarity are detected (heterologous probing). Generally, a probe is less than about 1000 nucleotides in length, optionally less than 500 nucleotides in length.",
                        "Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60\u00b0 C. for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) at 37\u00b0 C., and a wash in 1\u00d7 to 2\u00d7SSC (20\u00d7SSC=3.0 M NaCl/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55\u00b0 C.

Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C., and a wash in 0.1\u00d7SSC at 60 to 65\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes.",
                        "Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl, Anal. Biochem., 138:267-284 (1984): Tm81.5\u00b0 C.+16.6 (log M)+0.41 (% GC)\u22120.61 (% form)\u2212500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, % GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Tm is reduced by about 1\u00b0 C. for each 1% of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with \u226790% identity are sought, the Tm can be decreased 10\u00b0 C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3, or 4\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm); moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm); low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 20\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm). Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired Tm, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a Tm of less than 45\u00b0 C. (aqueous solution) or 32\u00b0 C. (formamide solution) it is preferred to increase the SSC concentration so that a higher temperature can be used.

Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available, e.g., through the National Center for Biotechnology-Information World Wide Web at ncbi.nih.gov. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, a cutoff of 100, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915).",

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787 (1993)). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance.",
                        "BLAST searches assume that proteins can be modeled as random sequences. However, many real proteins comprise regions of nonrandom sequences which may be homopolymeric tracts, short-period repeats, or regions enriched in one or more amino acids. Such low-complexity regions may be aligned between unrelated proteins even though other regions of the protein are entirely dissimilar. A number of low-complexity filter programs can be employed to reduce such low-complexity alignments. For example, the SEG (Wooten and Federhen, Comput. Chem., 17:149-163 (1993)) and XNU (Claverie and States, Comput. Chem., 17:191-201 (1993)) low-complexity filters can be employed alone or in combination.",

When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g. charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences which differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have \u201csequence similarity\u201d or \u201csimilarity\u201d. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., according to the algorithm of Meyers and Miller, Computer Applic. Biol. Sci., 4:11-17 (1988) e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif., USA).",

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.",

One of skill will recognize that these values can be appropriately adjusted to determine corresponding identity of proteins encoded by two nucleotide sequences by taking into account codon degeneracy, amino acid similarity, reading frame positioning and the like. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences for these purposes normally means sequence identity of at least 60%, or preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, and most preferably at least 95%.",
                        "Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. However, nucleic acids which do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides which they encode are substantially identical. This may occur, e.g., when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. One indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the polypeptide which the first nucleic acid encodes is immunologically cross reactive with the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid.",
                        "(e) The terms \u201csubstantial Identity\u201d in the context of a peptide indicates that a peptide comprises a sequence with at least 70% sequence identity to a reference sequence, preferably 80%, or preferably 85%, most preferably at least 90% or 95% sequence identity to the reference sequence over a specified comparison window. Optionally, optimal alignment is conducted using the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970). An indication that two peptide sequences are substantially identical is that one peptide is immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against the second peptide. Thus, a peptide is substantially identical to a second peptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by a conservative substitution. Peptides which are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d share sequences as noted above except that residue positions which are not identical may differ by conservative amino acid changes."

                        "The present invention provides, inter alia, compositions and methods for promoting pathogen resistance in plants, more particularly for improving Phytophthora resistance of susceptible plants. The compositions of the invention relate to the nonhost resistance gens identified from Arabidopsis which when mutated resulted in an increase in Phytophthora sojae susceptibility. Thus, these genes confer nonhost pathogen resistance of Arabidopsis and as such may be used to confer resistance in susceptible plant species such as soybean. Thus the genes and proteins identified here introduced or modulated to confer improved Phytophthora resistance in plants. These compositions can be transferred into plants to confer or improve Phytophthora resistance, modified to engineer gene sequences for broad based nonspecific resistance in plants, or to isolate and identify alternate gene forms and markers which may be used in breeding regimes. By \u201cconfer or improve Phytophthora or other such pathogen resistance\u201d is intended that the proteins or sequences, either alone or in combination with other proteins or sequences, enhance resistance of a plant to Phytophthora and Phytophthora-caused damage or to other pathogens which cause a similar plant reaction. In this manner, resistance to these fungal pathogens and other pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea (Psg), soybean cyst nematode (SCN), or soybean mosaic virus (SMV), Fusarium virguliforme can be enhanced or improved in the transformed plant or its progeny when at least one of the sequences of the invention is introduced to a susceptible plant or otherwise modulated according to the invention.",
                        "The compositions include nucleic acid molecules comprising sequences of plant genes and the polypeptides encoded thereby which are associated with nonhost disease resistance against Phytophthora in Arabidopsis have been identified. Particularly, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for At5g64600 (O-fucosyltrasnferase protein) (SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2, and 19); At5g65900 (DEAD-box ATP-dependant RNA helicase 27) (SEQ ID NOS 3, 4, and 20); At5g66380 (folate transporter 1, or FOLT1) (SEQ ID NOS: 3, 4, and 21); At3g59640 (glycine-rich protein) (SEQ ID NOS 7,8, and 22); At3g59650 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L51/S25/Cl-B8 protein) (SEQ ID NOS 9, 10, and 23); At3g60310 (protein of unknown function) (SEQ ID NOS 11. 12. And 24); At3g60840 (MAP65-4, microtubule-associated protein 65-4) (SEQ ID NOs:13, 14, and 25; At3g60920 (protein of unknown function) (SEQ ID NOS:15, 16, and 26); At3g61580 (fatty acid/spingolipid desaturase) (SEQ ID NOS:17, 18 and 27) and any conservatively modified variants, fragments, and homologs or full length sequences incorporating the same which retain the Phyphthora infection related activity described herein are part of the invention.",
                        "As discussed in more detail below, the sequences of the invention are presumably involved in many basic biochemical pathways that regulate plant pathogen resistance. Thus, methods are provided for the introduction or modulation of these sequences in a susceptible host plant to improve plant defense responses. Some of the methods involve stably transforming a plant with a nucleotide sequence of the invention operably linked with a promoter capable of driving expression of a gene in a plant cell other methods may involve inhibition of the same sequences to confer improved pathogen resistance in a particular plant.",
                        "Promoter and other regulatory elements which are natively associated with these genes can be easily isolated using the sequences and methods described herein with no more than routine experimentation. These sequences can also be used to identify promoter, enhancer or other signaling sequences in the regulatory regions of non host resistance genes. Such regulatory elements or promoters would provide for temporal and spatial expression of operably linked sequences with pathogen infection in a plant. Nucleotide sequences operably linked to such promoter sequences are transformed into a plant cell. Exposure of the transformed plant to a stimulus such as pathogen infection could induce transcriptional activation of the nucleotide sequences operably linked to these promoter regulatory sequences.",
                        "Transformed plants can be obtained having altered or enhanced responses to Phytophthora attack; hence, the methods and compositions may find uses in altering the response of plants to similar stresses as well. Thus, the sequences of the invention find use in engineering broad-spectrum disease and pest resistance in a variety of plants. It is within the skill in the art to assay protein activities obtained from various sources to determine whether the properties of the proteins are the same. In so doing, one of skill in the art may employ any of a wide array of known assays including, for example, biochemical and/or pathological assays. For example, one of skill in the art could readily produce a plant transformed with a non host resistance protein variant and assay a property of the native protein in that plant material to determine whether a particular property was retained by the variant.",
                        "The compositions and methods of the invention are presumably involved in biochemical pathways and as such may also find use in the activation or modulation of expression of other genes, including those involved in other aspects of pathogen defense and response.",
                        "By \u201cmodulating\u201d or \u201cmodulation\u201d is intended that the level of expression of a gene may be increased or decreased relative to genes driven by other promoters or relative to the normal or uninduced level of the gene in question.",

See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,395, herein incorporated by reference. These assays may be used to measure the activity of the polypeptides of the invention. Such techniques include, measuring over time, the average lesion diameter, the pathogen biomass, and the overall percentage of decayed plant tissues. For example, a plant either expressing an antipathogenic polypeptide or having an antipathogenic composition applied to its surface shows a decrease in tissue necrosis (i.e., lesion diameter) or a decrease in plant death following pathogen challenge when compared to a control plant that was not exposed to the antipathogenic composition. Alternatively, antipathogenic activity can be measured by a decrease in pathogen biomass. For example, a plant expressing an antipathogenic polypeptide or exposed to an antipathogenic composition is challenged with a pathogen of interest. Over time, tissue samples from the pathogen-inoculated tissues are obtained and RNA is extracted. The percent of a specific pathogen RNA transcript relative to the level of a plant specific transcript allows the level of pathogen biomass to be determined. See, for example, Thomma et al.

                                "The promoter used in the method of the invention may be an inducible promoter. An inducible promoter is a promoter that is capable of directly or indirectly activating transcription of a DNA sequence in response to an inducer. In the absence of an inducer, the DNA sequence will not be transcribed. Typically, the protein factor that binds specifically to an inducible promoter to activate transcription is present in an inactive form which is then directly or indirectly converted to the active form by the inducer. The inducer may be a chemical agent such as a protein, metabolite (sugar, alcohol etc.), a growth regulator, herbicide, or a phenolic compound or a physiological stress imposed directly by heat, salt, toxic elements etc. or indirectly through the action of a pathogen or disease agent such as a virus. A plant cell containing an inducible promoter may be exposed to an inducer by externally applying the inducer to the cell such as by spraying, watering, heating, or similar methods. Examples of inducible promoters include the inducible 70 kd heat shock promoter of D. melanogaster (Freeling, M., Bennet, D. C., Maize ADN 1, Ann. Rev. of Genetics, 19:297-323) and the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter which is induced by ethanol (Nagao, R. T., et al., Miflin, B. J., Ed. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cell Biology, Vol. 3, p. 384-438, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1986) or the Lex A promoter which is triggered with chemical treatment and is available through Ligand pharmaceuticals.

One such selection marker gene is neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) which confers resistance to kanamycin and the antibiotic G-418.

Polymerase chain reactions are also used to identify the presence of a transgene or expression using reverse transcriptase PCR amplification to monitor expression and PCR on genomic DNA. Other commonly used selection markers include the ampicillin resistance gene, the tetracycline resistance and the hygromycin resistance gene.

A cell may be simultaneously transformed with more than one vector provided that each vector has a unique selection marker gene. Alternatively, a cell may be transformed with more than one vector sequentially allowing an intermediate regeneration step after transformation with the first vector. Further, it may be possible to perform a sexual cross between individual plants or plant lines containing different DNA sequences or recombinant DNA molecules preferably the DNA sequences or the recombinant molecules are linked or located on the same chromosome, and then selecting from the progeny of the cross, plants containing both DNA sequences or recombinant DNA molecules.",

                                "As indicated above, it may be desirable to produce plant lines which are homozygous for a particular gene. In some species this is accomplished rather easily by the use of another culture or isolated microspore culture. This is especially true for the oil seed crop Brassica napus (Keller and Armstrong, Z. flanzenzucht 80:100-108, 1978). By using these techniques, it is possible to produce a haploid line that carries the inserted gene and then to double the chromosome number either spontaneously or by the use of colchicine. This gives rise to a plant that is homozygous for the inserted gene, which can be easily assayed for if the inserted gene carries with it a suitable selection marker gene for detection of plants carrying that gene. Alternatively, plants may be self-fertilized, leading to the production of a mixture of seed that consists of, in the simplest case, three types, homozygous (25%), heterozygous (50%) and null (25%) for the inserted gene. Although it is relatively easy to score null plants from those that contain the gene, it is possible in practice to score the homozygous from heterozygous plants by southern blot analysis in which careful attention is paid to the loading of exactly equivalent amounts of DNA from the mixed population, and scoring heterozygotes by the intensity of the signal from a probe specific for the inserted gene. It is advisable to verify the results of the southern blot analysis by allowing each independent transformant to self-fertilize, since additional evidence for homozygosity can be obtained by the simple fact that if the plant was homozygous for the inserted gene, all of the subsequent plants from the selfed seed will contain the gene, while if the plant was heterozygous for the gene, the generation grown from the selfed seed will contain null plants. Therefore, with simple selfing one can easily select homozygous plant lines that can also be confirmed by southern blot analysis.",
                                "Creation of homozygous parental lines makes possible the production of hybrid plants and seeds which will contain a modified protein component. Transgenic homozygous parental lines are maintained with each parent containing either the first or second recombinant DNA sequence operably linked to a promoter. Also incorporated in this scheme are the advantages of growing a hybrid crop, including the combining of more valuable traits and hybrid vigor.",

Other methods of differentiating polymorphic (allelic) variants of polynucleotides of the present invention can be had by utilizing molecular marker techniques well known to those of skill in the art including such techniques as: 1) single stranded conformation analysis (SSCA); 2) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE); 3) RNase protection assays; 4) allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs); 5) the use of proteins which recognize nucleotide mismatches, such as the E. coli mutS protein; and 6) allele-specific PCR. Other approaches based on the detection of mismatches between the two complementary DNA strands include clamped denaturing gel electrophoresis (CDGE); heteroduplex analysis (HA); and chemical mismatch cleavage (CMC). Thus, the present invention further provides a method of genotyping comprising the steps of contacting, under stringent hybridization conditions, a sample suspected of comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention with a nucleic acid probe. Generally, the sample is a plant sample; preferably, a sample suspected of comprising a maize polynucleotide of the present invention (e.g., gene, mRNA). The nucleic acid probe selectively hybridizes, under stringent conditions, to a subsequence of a polynucleotide of the present invention comprising a polymorphic marker. Selective hybridization of the nucleic acid probe to the polymorphic marker nucleic acid sequence yields a hybridization complex. Detection of the hybridization complex indicates the presence of that polymorphic marker in the sample. In preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid probe comprises a polynucleotide of the present invention."

Generally, sequence shuffling provides a means for generating libraries of polynucleotides having a desired characteristic which can be selected or screened for. Libraries of recombinant polynucleotides are generated from a population of related sequence polynucleotides which comprise sequence regions which have substantial sequence identity and can be homologously recombined in vitro or in vivo. The population of sequence-recombined polynucleotides comprises a subpopulation of polynucleotides which possess desired or advantageous characteristics and which can be selected by a suitable selection or screening method. The characteristics can be any property or attribute capable of being selected for or detected in a screening system, and may include properties of: an encoded protein, a transcriptional element, a sequence controlling transcription, RNA processing, RNA stability, chromatin conformation, translation, or other expression property of a gene or transgene, a replicative element, a protein-binding element, or the like, such as any feature which confers a selectable or detectable property. In some embodiments, the selected characteristic will be a decreased Km and/or increased KCat over the wild-type protein as provided herein. In other embodiments, a protein or polynucleotide generated from sequence shuffling will have a ligand binding affinity greater than the non-shuffled wild-type polynucleotide.

We used the chemical mutagen, ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), to generate 3,556 EMS-induced mutant plants in pen1-1. Then we have screened over 3,000 M2 families developed from these mutants for possible loss of Phytophthora resistance in 24-well microtiter plates as follows. Seedling were grown in water for 10 days and then inoculated with P. sojae zoospores for 48 hours in wells of microtiter plates. Thereafter, dead cells of inoculated seedlings were stained with trypan blue dye (Koch and Slusarenko 1990) and identified by conducting light microscopy. We identified 30 putative P. sojae susceptible mutants. We tentatively named these putative mutants (putants) pss1 (Phytophthora sojae susceptible) through pss30.",

We sequence the GRP1 gene from the pss21 mutant and observed that it did not contain any mutation. Therefore, we concluded that Pss21 is most likely different from Pss1 and there are most likely at least two mechanisms conferring immunity of Arabidopsis against the fungal pathogen, F. virguliforme that causes sudden death syndrome in soybean. pss6 and pss30 mutants are immune to F. virguliforme. Therefore, Pss21 is most unlikely mapped to either of Pss6 and Pss30 loci.

We therefore concluded that mapping of the Pss30 region was completed. We have finished mapping two Arabidopsis Pss genes, Pss1 and Pss30; and therefore, have completed this research objective.",

By comparing sequences of the Pss1 region of the bulked susceptible F2:3 families homozygous for the pss1 allele with that of the ecotype Col-0 with the aid of the SHORE program (Ossowski et al. 2010), we identified nine mutations that are located in the Pss1 region. Three of the nine mutations were originated from the pen1-1 mutant background used to generate the pss1 mutant. Therefore, they are not candidate Pss1 genes and were not considered for further investigation. The remaining six genes carrying point mutations are listed in Table 1.",

The results are presented in Table 2. We observed that none of the six candidate Pss1 genes are conserved in soybean. Thus, it is possible that orthologous Pss1 sequence is missing in soybean and transfer of Pss1 to soybean may result in enhanced Phytophthora resistance in soybean.",

Twenty-eight T-DNA mutants with insertion in five candidate Pss1 genes were collected from ABRC (http://abrc.osu.edu/) and analyzed for T-DNA insertion and the disease phenotypes following P. sojae infection. CS850460, SALK\u2014148857C and SALK\u2014090245C lines carrying T-DNA insertion mutations in the At3g59640 gene encoding a glycine rich protein were consistently infected by P. sojae.

The homozygous T-DNA mutants in the GRP1 gene identified from CS850460, SALK\u2014148857C and SALK\u2014090245C lines were termed grp1-1, grp1-2 and grp1-3, respectively (FIG. 1). The lines carrying T-DNA insertion mutations for remaining four candidate Pss1 genes segregated for the T-DNA insertions, but were resistant to P. sojae (data not presented) and therefore these four genes cannot be candidate Pss1 genes. GK-476F03 line was obtained from NASC (http://arabidopsis.info/). It contains a T-DNA insertion in the sixth candidate Pss1 gene, AT3G59650. The mutant was resistant to P. sojae; therefore, AT3G59650 is not a candidate Pss1 gene.",

All three primers were simultaneously used in PCR of genomic DNA prepared from grp1-1 and Col-0 (extreme left panel).

Of the two T-DNA insertion mutations in the promoter region, grp1-1 did not show any GRP1 transcripts and was susceptible to P. sojae. grp1-2 with a T-DNA insertion in the promoter, showed leaky expression for GRP1 and was also not always infected by the pathogen (Table 3). The T-DNA insertion mutation in exon 1 (grp1-3), lacking GRP1 transcripts, was infected by the pathogen. These results suggest that GRP1 encoding a glycine rich protein is the candidate Pss1 gene.",

Floral dip method (Zhang et al. 2006) was used to transform the pss1 mutant. The bar gene encoding basta resistance was used as a selectable marker to transform the pss1 mutant with the GRP1 gene.

By comparing sequences of the Pss30 region in the bulked DNA sample of five susceptible F2:3 families homozygous for the pss30 allele with that of the ecotype Col-0 with the aid of the SHORE program (Ossowski et al. 2010), we identified four mutations that are located in three genes of the Pss30 region (Table 4). We sequenced the pen1-1 mutant, in which pss30 was generated for these four mutations and observed that all four mutations are pss30-specific. None of these mutations were originated from the pen1-1 mutant background and therefore the three genes carrying four mutations were considered to be the candidate Pss30 genes. The three genes carrying point mutations are listed in Table 4. We collected the SALK T-DNA insertion lines for the three candidate Pss30 genes (Table 5). Only SALK\u2014011184 carrying T-DNA insertion in the At5g66380 gene was infected by P. sojae.

This result is consistent with the expression levels of these three genes reported in the Genvestigator (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/plant.jsp) database.

Transformation of a T-DNA insertion grp1 mutant established that the GRP cDNA can complement the lost function of the GRP1 in this mutant (FIG. 10). We subsequently transformed the gene into the soybean cultivar, Williams 82. The progenies of two independent transforments have been evaluated by infecting with multiple P. sojae isolates and F. virguliforme Mont-1 isolate. The FIGS. 7 and 8 show that incorporation of Arabidopsis GRP1 in transgenic soybean resulted in enhanced Phytophthora resistance.

The cDNA fragment of the wild type Arabidopsis GRP gene was used to complement the SALK mutant, CS850460. Three leaves of 21-day old Arabidopsis seedlings were inoculated with 10 \u03bcl P. sojae zoospores drop/leaf (105 zoospores/mL). A, the SALK mutant, CS850460 lacking a functional Arabidopsis GRP1 gene was susceptible to the soybean pathogen, P. sojae; B, the introduction of the cDNA fragment of the wild type GRP1 gene complemented the mutant phenotype and recovered the wild type resistant phenotype in the transgenic SALK CS850460 leaves, which showed resistance comparable to the wild type, Columbia-0 (Col-0) ecotype level.

Leaves of wild-type soybean cultivar, Williams 82 but not the transgenic soybean line, ST154-13, carrying the Arabidopsis GRP1 gene, showed significant spread of disease lesion in inoculated leaves transgenic soybean plants. The results showed that Arabidopsis nonhost resistance GRP1 provided nonhost resistance against the oomycete pathogen, P. sojae in transgenic soybean plants. This indicates that the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance mechanism is functional in soybean plants transformed with the GRP1 gene from Arabidopsis.
