                        "Cardiotonic steroids (CTS) consist of a group of chemicals that specifically bind to the Na+/K+-ATPase. They include plant-derived digitalis drugs such as digoxin and ouabain and vertebrate-derived aglycone such as bufalin and marinobufagenin. Recent studies have identified both ouabain and marinobufagenin as endogenous steroids whose production and secretion are regulated by multiple physiological and pathological stimuli including angiotensin II and epinephrine in humans. These steroids can activate protein kinases and regulate cell growth, gene expression, intracellular calcium, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, thus playing important roles in the control of renal and cardiovascular functions, protection of ischemia/reperfusion injury and stimulation or inhibition of cell growth.",
                        "Src family kinases are 52-62-kDa membrane-associated nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and they participate in several tyrosine phosphorylation-related signaling pathways in response to various extracellular ligands. Src, for example, contains at least three important protein interaction domains. The SH3 domain binds to polyproline motifs and the SH2 domain interacts with the phosphorylated tyrosine residues. The kinase domain reacts with the nucleotide and phosphorylates the substrate. Binding of protein ligands to the SH3 or SH2 domain can activate Src. Proteins that bind with kinase domain of Src were also reported to be capable of regulating Src activity.",
                        "Na+/K+-ATPase, the molecular machinery of the cellular sodium pump, belongs to a family of evolutionarily ancient enzymes that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to membrane ion translocation. It is now believed that the Na+/K+-ATPase has dual functions. It not only pumps Na+ and K+ across cell membranes, but also relays the extracellular CTS signal to intracellular compartments via activation of different protein kinases.",
                        "Specifically, the inventors discovered that the Na+/K+-ATPase interacts with Src and Src family kinases to form a functional receptor. Binding of ouabain to this receptor activates Src, which in turn phosphorylates various effectors, resulting in the assembly and activation of different pathways including the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 and phospholipase C/protein kinase C cascades as well as increases in intracellular Ca2+ and cellular ROS production. The activation of these signaling pathways eventually leads to changes in cardiac and renal functions, stimulation of cell proliferation and tissue fibrosis, protection of tissue against ischemia/reperfusion injury and inhibition of cancer cell growth. These effects occur in a tissue/cell-specific manner.",
                        "Because Src and Src family kinases play an important role in cellular signal transduction, many researchers are engaged in searching for kinase-specific and pathway-specific inhibitors. So far, many inhibitors have been developed, and most of them are developed as ATP analogs that compete for ATP binding to these kinases, resulting in inhibition of kinase activity. However, the lack of pathway specificity is a major disadvantage of the current Src inhibitors. Since Src and Src family kinases are essential for many cellular functions, a generic inhibition could compromise the overall benefit of the treatment. In the past, this has been evident by severe side effects of these inhibitors in animal studies. In addition, some of these inhibitors exhibit cross-activity toward receptor tyrosine kinases.",
                        "Cardiotonic steroids have been used as drugs to treat congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases because they increase intracellular Ca2+ and thus contractility. However, these chemicals not only activate Na+/K+-ATPase-related cellular signaling pathways, but also inhibit the ion pumping function of Na+/K+-ATPase. The latter contributes to their clinical side effects and limits the clinical applications of these drugs. Endogenous cardiotonic steroids are hormones that regulate renal and cardiovascular functions. Over-stimulation of the newly discovered Na+/K+-ATPase/Src by these hormones is known to cause high blood pressure and induce abnormal cell proliferation in renal epithethial cells as well as induce tissue fibrosis.",
                        "Considering the above-mentioned concerns, it is clear that there remains a need in the art for a method of developing a pathway (e.g., Na+/K+-ATPase)-specific Src inhibitor or activator that can be used to block endogenous CTS-activated Src pathways or stimulate the Na+/K+-ATPase-associated Src to mimic the CTS effect without inhibiting the ion pumping function of Na+/K+-ATPase. Moreover, there is a need for targeting the newly discovered Na+/K+-ATPase/Src receptor complex to develop novel agonists or antagonists of the receptor so that the receptor function of Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex can be either stimulated for treating diseases such as congestive heart failure and ischemia/reperfusion injury or inhibited for treating diseases such as tissue fibrosis and cancer.",
                        "There is also a need for assays to monitor Src interaction with the Na+/K+-ATPase and kinase enzymatic activities that are sensitive, simple to use, and adaptable to high-throughput screening methods.",
                        "There is also a need for a method for isolating operationally defined ligands involved in protein-protein interactions and for optimally identifying an exhaustive set of modular domain-containing proteins implicated in binding with the ligands.",
                        "If such a method were available, however, such a method would be useful for the isolation of any polypeptide having a functioning version of any functional domain of interest.",
                        "Such a general method would be of tremendous utility in that whole families of related proteins each with its own version of the functional domain of interest could be identified. Knowledge of such related proteins would contribute greatly to our understanding of various physiological processes, including cell growth or death, malignancy, renal/cardiovascular function and immune reactions, to name a few.",
                        "Such a method would also contribute to the development of increasingly more effective therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic agents having fewer side effects.",
                        "According to the present invention, just such a method is provided."

This interaction effectively keeps Src in an inactive state, indicating that the Na+/K+-ATPase is an effective Src inhibitor.",
                        "Since Na+/K+-ATPase, as a newly discovered signal transducer, mediates several signaling pathways that relate with cancer cell growth, cardiac fibrosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury and uremic cardiomyopathy, the inventors herein have now discovered that interfering of such interaction between Na+/K+-ATPase and Src provides useful treatment information for these diseases.",
                        "Detailed mapping of the functional domains in both Src and the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha 1 subunit reveals that the Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated inhibition of Src is due to the interaction between the N domain, Specifically the ND1 peptide, of the alpha subunit and the Src kinase domain, specifically the KD1 peptide.",
                        "Further analysis reveals that a 20 amino acid peptide (P-3) derived from ND1 is sufficient to bind and inhibit Src activity as well as other Src family kinases such as Lyn. Moreover, when a cell-penetrating peptide (e.g. TAT or AP) is attached to the Src-inhibitory peptide, this new peptide is fully capable of entering cells and inhibiting cellular Src activity. When tested in prostate cancer DU145 cells, these tagged peptide inhibitors are effective in blocking DU145 cell proliferation. The inventors also found that the KD1 derived from the Src kinase domain could bind with Na+/K+-ATPase and was effective in activating the Na+/K+-ATPase-inhibited Src by competing the binding motif for Src.",
                        "Thus, the inventors have developed peptides that are useful to either activate or inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase pathway-specific Src or Src family kinases. Moreover, the inventors have identified an interacting site (i.e. between the ND1 of \u03b1 subunits and KD1 of Src) that can be used as a target for developing other peptide and small molecule inhibitors or activators that are more potent, tissue specific or have better pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic properties.",
                        "In another aspect, the peptides represent new classes of Src inhibitors and/or activators. Because these peptides target the region that specifically interact with Na+/K+-ATPase other than generically competing for ATP binding, they are more specific and have less cross-reactivity with receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, these peptides provide a pathway-specific modulation of Src activity, thus more narrowly (specifically) targeted. Furthermore, structure-functional studies will produce a more potent and specific inhibitor/activator for individual Src family kinases since each has different KD1 sequence. Since other alpha subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase also bind the kinase domain, it is possible to develop isoform-specific Src inhibitors. Finally, using the structural information, it is now possible to develop small molecules that have better pharmacokinetical and pharmacodynamical properties.",
                        "Sequence-based analysis of the Src inhibitor peptides or crystallization of the identified interacting domains may reveal the exact interface between Src and the Na+/K+-ATPase, which shall allow the development of new peptides or small molecules to either inhibit or activate Src. Using the identified interaction (the Na+/K+-ATPase/Src interaction or the cc subunit N domain/Src kinase domain interaction), a rapid screen assay can be developed for large scale and high out-put screen of additional peptides and small molecules. Genetic methods or chemicals or hormones could be used to either up or down regulate cellular Na+/K+-ATPases, thus inhibiting or activating cellular Src or Src family kinases.",

It is important to note that the purified Na+/K+-ATPase is a membrane-attached preparation in which the \u03b11 and 01 subunits are associated in a 1:1 molar ratio and accounts for more than 90% of protein contents in the preparation (FIG. 2B and Jorgensen, 1974, 1988).",

A significant amount of \u03b11 subunit was detected when 0.5 \u03bcg of the Na+/K+-ATPase was used in the binding assay. To quantitate the binding, experiments as shown in FIG. 2D were performed. The data showed that GST-Src pulled down 12\u00b12.4% (n=3) of the input when 2 \u03bcg of the purified Na+/K+-ATPase was used. These data suggest a possibility of direct binding between Src and the Na+/K+ ATPase. To control that the binding was not induced by solubilization of the Na+/K+-ATPase, the inventors repeated the above experiments with the purified Na+/K+-ATPase in the absence of detergent, showing the similar interaction between the Na+/K+-ATPase and GST-Src. To dissect which domains of Src interact with the Na+/K+-ATPase (for domain structures see FIG. 3A), the inventors expressed and purified the GST-SH2, GST-SH3, GST-SH3SH2, and GST-kinase domain fusion proteins (Ma et al., 2000). Using the same in vitro binding assay, the inventors observed that the purified Na+/K+ ATPase bound to the kinase domain, the SH3SH2, and the SH2 domain, but not the SH3 domain (FIG. 3C). Because the GST-SH3SH2 pulled down more Na+/K+-ATPase than that of the GST-SH2, this construct was used in subsequent experiments.",

The data showed that the GST-CD3 from the H+/K+-ATPase, but not the SERCA, pulled down Src from the LLC-PK1 cell lysates (FIG. 4C).",

Employing the same binding assay, the inventors found that the GST-CD3 interacted with the kinase domain, but not the SH3SH2 domain of Src. In contrast, the CD2 interacted with the SH3SH2 domain, but not the kinase domain (FIG. 4D). Taken together, the above results indicate that Na+/K+ ATPase can directly interact with Src through the CD2 and CD3 domains of the \u03b11 subunit.",

                                "Because binding of SH3SH2 domain to a regulatory protein is sufficient to activate Src, the inventors tested whether binding of Src to the Na+/K+-ATPase results in Src activation. When purified recombinant Src was incubated with different amounts of the purified Na+/K+-ATPase in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ in detergent-free PBS solution, the autophosphorylation of Src at Tyr418 (pY418), an indication of Src activation, was reduced in a concentration dependent manner (FIG. 5A). Because the inventors observed the same results when the experiments were repeated in the presence of 100 \u03bcM vanadate that completely inhibited the hydrolysis of ATP by the Na+/K+-ATPase, the effect of the Na+/K+ ATPase on Src is likely due to the interaction between these two proteins, but not the reduction of ATP. To further test this hypothesis, the inventors determined the effect of CD3 on Src. Because the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein is reported to inhibit Src by binding to the kinase domain, the inventors reasoned that interaction between the CD3 and the kinase domain might be sufficient to keep Src in an inactive state. Indeed, as shown in FIG. 5B, GST-CD3, but not GST, acted as the purified Na+/K+-ATPase, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the Src pY418.",
                                "Because the above data suggest that the Na+/K+-ATPase may bind Src and keep it in an inactive state, the inventors now believe that the Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex may constitute a functional complex for ouabain and act in a manner similar to that of G protein-coupled receptor/G protein complex; namely, binding of ouabain to this complex releases the trapped Src kinase domain, resulting in Src activation and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream effectors. To test, the inventors incubated the recombinant Src with the purified Na+/K+-ATPase in detergent-free PBS solution in the presence or the absence of ouabain. Western blot analysis indicated that addition of ouabain significantly increased the pY418 in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 6A).",
                                "To confirm that changes in pY418 correlates with Src activity, the inventors also measured the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation using a commercial available kinase assay kit. As shown in FIG. 6B, although the Na+/K+-ATPase kept Src in an inactive state, addition of ouabain restored the kinase activity. The inventors also determined if vanadate affected the activity of this Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex. As shown in FIG. 6C, although 10-100 \u03bcM vanadate completely inhibited the ATPase activity, it showed no effect on Src pY418. More importantly, ouabain was still able to stimulate pY418 of Src in the presence of vanadate.",
                                "To test whether ouabain activates Src by dissociating it from the interacting Na+/K+-ATPase, the inventors incubated Src with the purified Na+/K+-ATPase. Because the purified Na+/K+-ATPase is attached to the membrane, it can be pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000\u00d7g for 30 min. Centrifugation was sufficient to sediment Src only when it was bound to the Na+/K+-ATPase. Western blot analysis also showed that the cosedimented Src was kept in an inactive state (FIG. 7A), which is consistent with the findings presented in FIG. 5. Because only the Na+/K+-ATPase-bound Src can be pelleted down, the inventors reasoned that the recovered Src would be reduced in ouabain-treated samples if ouabain dissociates Src from the Na+/K+-ATPase.",
                                "Surprisingly, when the same analysis was conducted after the samples were treated with ouabain before centrifugation, the inventors found that ouabain had no effect on total Src cosedimented with the Na+/K+-ATPase, yet increased the amount of Src pY418 (FIG. 7B). Because the inventors have shown that multiple domains are involved in Src interaction with the Na+/K+ ATPase, the above findings led us to test if ouabain dissociates only a single (kinase) domain from the interacting Na+/K+-ATPase. To do so, 1 \u03bcg of the purified Na+/K+ ATPase was incubated with GST-Src, GST-SH3SH2, or GST kinase in detergent-free PBS solution, and the complexes were collected by centrifugation. Afterward, the complexes were exposed to 10 \u03bcM ouabain.",
                                "As depicted in FIG. 7C, ouabain showed no effect on the binding of either full-length Src or the SH3SH2 domain to the Na+/K+-ATPase, but dissociated the kinase domain from the Na+/K+-ATPase, which is in accordance with the findings presented in FIG. 5. The fact that ouabain had no effect on the binding of the SH3SH2 domain to the Na+/K+-ATPase apparently explains why ouabain did not change the overall binding of Src to the enzyme. To further test if releasing of the kinase domain is sufficient to activate Src, the inventors preincubated the GST-kinase fusion protein with the Na+/K+-ATPase before adding full-length Src to compete for the kinase domain binding sites. Western blot analysis showed that GST-kinase, but not GST or GST-SH3SH2, significantly increased Src pY418 (FIG. 7D). Taken together, these findings provide strong support for the notion that ouabain activates the Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex by freeing the trapped kinase domain of Src.",

                                "If ouabain activates the Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex by releasing the kinase domain in live cells, the inventors now believed that ouabain would increase the distance between the kinase domain and the interacting Na+/K+-ATPase because the freed kinase domain will bind and phosphorylate its effectors. This could result in the reduction of FRET signal between coexpressed Src-ECFP and EYFP-rat a 1. To test, the inventors performed live cell FRET as well as BRET analysis.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 8A, excitation of ECFP at 456 nm caused emissions in both ECFP spectrum (detected between 465 and 509 nm as FECFP) and EYFP spectrum (detected between 530 and 570 nm as FEYFP) in control cells, indicating a potential FRET between Src-ECFP and EYFP-rat \u03b11. To test if ouabain stimulates the release of the kinase domain, the same cell was then exposed to ouabain and measured for both ECFP and EYFP intensity. As shown in FIG. 8A, once the cells were exposed to 100 \u03bcM ouabain, there was a time-dependent decrease in FEYFP and a concomitant increase in FECFP, indicating that ouabain caused a reduction in FRET between Src-ECFP and EYFP-rat \u03b11. As a control, the same experiments were repeated in cells transfected with ECFP and EYFP, and no detectable FRET was observed.",
                                "Because ECFP has to be excited in order to perform FRET analysis, photobleaching and spectral bleedthrough do occur during the experiments, complicating data analysis, especially in live cells. In addition, because ouabain-insensitive rat \u03b11 was used for FRET analysis, the inventors wanted to test if ouabain-sensitive \u03b11 also functions similarly to the rat \u03b11. Therefore, the inventors performed the BRET analysis using GFP canine \u03b11 and Src-Renilla luciferase (Src-Rluc) to corroborate the above findings. Both constructs were transiently transfected into 293T cells and a construct of GFP-fused Rluc was used as a positive control. Human 293T cells were chosen for BRET analysis because these cells could be more easily transiently transfected under our experimental conditions.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 8B, coexpression of GFP-canine \u03b11 and Src-Rluc yielded a BRET ratio comparable to that of the positive control, indicating that Src interacts with the Na+/K+-ATPase in live cells. Significantly, when the transfected cells were exposed to different concentrations of ouabain, ouabain caused a dose-dependent decrease in the BRET ratio. Significant decrease was detected when 10 nM ouabain was used (FIG. 8C). These data are consistent with the known ouabain sensitivity of the canine \u03b11 and support the results of FRET analysis in FIG. 8A.",
                                "Increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation are essential for ouabain-induced changes in cellular functions. Although activation of Src by ouabain leads to transactivation of the Na+/K+-ATPase associated EGF receptor and PLC-,y, the inventors have not tested whether the activation of the identified Na+/K+-ATPase/Src complex is responsible for ouabain-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of other proteins that are associated with the signaling complex.",
                                "To test, LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to 1 \u03bcM ouabain for 5 min. Cell lysates from both control and treated cells were then immunoprecipitated with anti-\u03b11 antibody. When the immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and probed for phosphotyrosine with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the inventors observed that ouabain indeed stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple Na+/K+-ATPase-associated proteins (FIG. 9A). To confirm that Src is required for the initiation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ouabain, the inventors repeated the same experiments in Src family kinase-knockout SYF cells.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 9B, the effects of ouabain on protein tyrosine phosphorylation were completely abolished in SYF cells. On the other hand, when Src is knocked back into the SYF cells (SYF+Src), ouabain's effects on protein tyrosine phosphorylation were restored, indicating an essential role of Src in initiation of ouabain-activated protein tyrosine phosphorylation. This is further supported by the fact that Src inhibitor PP2 was able to block ouabain-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in SYF+Src cells.",
                                "Because the inventors have shown that ouabain stimulated the recruitment of Src to the Na+/K+-ATPase signaling complex, the inventors now believe that ouabain first activates the Na+/K+-ATPase-bound Src and subsequently results in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, caveolin-1, and other effectors. These effectors in turn provide binding sites for recruiting additional Src and other signaling proteins onto the signaling complex.",
                                "To test, the inventors treated the LLC-PK1 cells with 1 \u03bcM ouabain for 5 min in the presence or absence of 1 \u03bcM PP2. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated by anti-\u03b11 antibody. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitants showed that ouabain increased coprecipitated Src in control cells, but not in cells that were pretreated with PP2 (FIG. 9C), supporting the notion that the initial activation of Src is necessary for recruiting additional Src to the complex. Control experiments also showed that pretreatment of LLC-PK1 cells with PP3, an inactive analog of Src inhibitor PP2, failed to block ouabain-induced recruitment of Src to the Na+/K+-ATPase (FIG. 9C).",
                                "To corroborate the above findings, the inventors also performed the immunoprecipitation experiment with isolated caveolae preparations from LLC-PK1 cells. The inventors showed previously that ouabain increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in a Src-dependent manner in the isolated caveolae preparations. It also stimulated the formation of the Na+/K+-ATPase/caveolin-1/Src complex (Wang et al., 2004). However, because addition of ATP is required for ouabain to activate Src in the isolated caveolae, the inventors believed that ouabain could not stimulate the recruitment of Src to the caveolin-1 complex in the absence of ATP if Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is required for the additional recruitment of Src. Indeed, this is what the inventors observed when the inventors repeated the above experiments in the absence of ATP (FIG. 9D). Taken together, the data clearly show that ouabain signals through the Na+/K+-ATPase by first activating Src and then recruiting more effector proteins including Src to the signaling Na+/K+-ATPase.",

The inventors further demonstrate that the Na+/K+-ATPase and Src can assemble into a functional signaling complex via the identified protein domains and that the binding of ouabain to the Na+/K+-ATPase activates Src and provokes downstream protein tyrosine phosphorylation. This and other conclusions are summarized in FIG. 10 and discussed below.",
                                "The Na+/K+-ATPase/Src Complex as a Receptor for Cardiotonic Steroids",
                                "Because the \u03b11 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase contains a conserved proline-rich motif in its N-terminus (Yudowski et al., 2000), the inventors initially thought that ouabain might promote the interaction between the SH3 of Src and the Na+/K+-ATPase, resulting in the activation of Src. To the inventors' surprise, GST pulldown assay showed that the SH3 domain was not involved in direct interaction with the Na+/K+-ATPase. Instead, the SH2 and the kinase domains of Src interact with the CD2 and CD3 domains of the Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 subunit, respectively. In addition, the inventors' results showed that both Na+/K+-ATPase and GST-CD3 inhibited Src activity (FIG. 5). Although the inventors cannot exclude the possibility that other Src regulator copurified with Na+/K+-ATPase is involved, the fact that purified CD3 domain alone could mimic the effect of Na+/K+-ATPase strongly suggested that Na+/K+-ATPase is sufficient to inactivate Src.",
                                "The fact that the Na+/K+-ATPase and Src form an inactive Src complex led the inventors to now believe that this receptor complex may transmit the ouabain signals in a way similar to those of cytokine receptors. Although these receptors have no intrinsic kinase activity, coupling to Src allows them to activate the downstream protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Several examples described herein support this notion.",
                                "First, ouabain-induced changes in the conformation of the Na+/K+-ATPase are sufficient to free the kinase domain of Src (FIG. 7). Interestingly, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA, is able to bring the CD3 close to the membrane. If ouabain can exert similar effect on the CD3, this may explain how ouabain releases the kinase domain from the Na+/K+-ATPase. On the other hand, because ouabain has no effect on the binding of the SH3SH2 domain to the CD2, this domain could function as a hinge, keeping the activated Src binding to the signaling Na+/K+-ATPase for specific and robust signal transmission.",
                                "Second, antagonizing the binding of Src kinase domain to the Na+/K+-ATPase by addition of GST-kinase domain fusion protein acted as ouabain and stimulated Src pY418.",
                                "Third, the observed effect of ouabain on Src (FIG. 6) is not due to the inhibition of the ATPase activity because vanadate showed no effect on Src at the concentration that completely inhibited the ATPase activity.",
                                "Furthermore, the GSTCD3, which does not hydrolyze ATP, can also inhibit Src activation. Similarly, the findings also argue against the involvement of changes in ion concentrations in ouabain-induced activation of Src because these experiments were performed in the test tubes under the same ionic conditions.",
                                "Finally, both FRET and BRET analyses indicated that ouabain did release the kinase domain in live cells (FIG. 8). It is important to note that the effects of ouabain on the Na+/K+-ATPase/Src-kinase domain interaction were dosedependent and correlated well with the known dose-response curve of ouabain binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase (Haas et al., 2002).",
                                "In short, the inventors have demonstrated a novel mechanism of ouabain-provoked signal transduction. Because Src family kinases are highly conserved, the inventors believe that the signaling Na+/K+ ATPase may interact with other members of the Src family. In addition, mammalian cells express at least four different types of a subunit in a tissue-specific manner, and it is now believed that different isoforms may also interact with Src in a tissue-specific manner. To this end, it is of interest to note that Src also interacts with the CD3 domain of H+/K+ ATPase (FIG. 4C), suggesting a potential signaling function of the H+/K+-ATPase in regulation of Src activity.",
                                "The inventors also believe that these P-ATPases may also serve as Src effectors because recent studies have suggested a Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of these P-ATPases. (Kanagawa et al., 2000; Masaki et al., 2000; Ferrandi et al., 2004).",
                                "Significance of Findings",
                                "Na+/K+-ATPase is well-known for its essential function in maintaining the Na+ and K+ ion concentrations across cell membrane in mammalian cells. The fact that the binding site for cardiotonic steroids is so conserved throughout the phylogeny of eukaryotes indicates that these steroids must play an important role in regulation of the Na+/K+-ATPase function. Because the ion pumping was the only known function of the Na+/K+-ATPase until a few years ago, it is well accepted by the field that cardiotonic steroids must signal by inhibition of the ATPase activity although there is no hormonal precedent for such signal transduction. This mode of action has led many in the field to question the significance of endogenous cardiotonic steroids because they circulate at subnanomolar concentrations under normal physiological conditions, and can only bind to 1-2% of cell surface Na+/K+-ATPase. Because most mammalian cells contain \u22121 million Na+/K+-ATPase molecules per cell, it is highly inefficient for cardiotonic steroids to purely function as an inhibitor to the pumping function of Na+/K+-ATPase because they have to work against the large pumping capacity of the cells. On the other hand, if the binding site is conserved for regulating the signaling function of the Na+/K+-ATPase, cardiotonic steroids will function as true agonists. As estimated by our colocalization analysis, \u221225% of the Na+/K+-ATPase has the potential to interact with Src. Activation of 1-2% of these receptors by ouabain will produce a few thousand active molecules per cell. Based on the findings of EGF signaling in HeLa cells and the principle of signal amplification, this will be sufficient to generate strong signals via kinase cascades, especially if the signaling event occurs in a membrane microdomain such as caveolae. Consistent with this, recent studies have demonstrated in both cultured cells and animal models that physiological concentrations of ouabain (e.g., 0.1-1 nM) were able to activate Src and ERKs (Aydemir-Koksoy et al., 2001; Ferrandi et al., 2004).",
                                "Pharmacologically, the inventors have demonstrated that ouabain-induced inotropy is accompanied by the activation of Src and ERKs in the isolated heart preparations as well as in the cultured myocytes (Mohammadi et al., 2003). Furthermore, inhibition of Src and ERKs blocked ouabain-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ in cardiac myocytes (Tian et al., 2001).",
                                "Thus, the examples herein reveal the possible molecular mechanism of digitalis-induced inotropy in the heart. The examples herein also show that this is useful for developing chemicals or peptides that can stimulate the signaling function of the Na+/K+-ATPase without affecting the ion pumping function. In addition, the inventors herein provide the insight into the molecular mechanism, by which a membrane transporter uses Src to form a functional signaling complex. Because many membrane transporters and ion channels undergo either substrate- or ligand-dependent conformational changes as the Na+/K+-ATPase, these findings raise an important biological question as to whether other membrane transporters are also involved in signal transduction, thus constituting another group of important receptors and signal transducers. To this end, the inventors note that the CD3 of Na+/K+-ATPase is highly conserved among many different P-type ATPases and now believe that other P-type ATPases are (e.g., H+/K+-ATPase shown in FIG. 4C) also involved in regulation of Src. The inventors also note that several recent reports have demonstrated that Src interacts with and regulates many other membrane ion channels (Yu et al., 1997; Sobko et al., 1998; Tiran et al., 2003)."

                                "The Na+/K+-ATPase and Src form a signaling receptor complex. Here the inventors show how alterations in the amount and properties of the Na+/K+-ATPase affect basal Src activity and ouabain-induced signal transduction. Several \u03b11 subunit knockdown cell lines were generated by transfecting LLC-PK1 cells with a vector expressing \u03b11-specific small interference RNA. Although the \u03b11 knockdown resulted in significant decreases in Na+/K+-ATPase activity, it increased the basal Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a Src effector. Concomitantly it also abolished ouabain-induced activation of Src and ERK1/2. When the knockdown cells were rescued by a rat \u03b11, both Na+/K+-ATPase activity and the basal Src activity were restored. In addition, ouabain was able to stimulate Src and ERK1/2 in the rescued cells at a much higher concentration, consistent with the established differences in ouabain sensitivity between pig and rat \u03b11. Finally, both fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the pumping-null rat \u03b11 (D371E) mutant could also bind Src. Expression of this mutant restored the basal Src activity and focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, the inventors now believe that LLC-PK1 cells contain a pool of Src-interacting Na+/K+-ATPase that not only regulates Src activity but also serves as a receptor for ouabain to activate protein kinases.",
                                "The activation of Src is essential for ouabain-induced changes in many cellular activities including the regulation of intracellular calcium, gene expression, and cell growth and the inventors have examined whether the Na+/K+-ATPase interacts directly with Src to form a functional signaling receptor.",
                                "Using in vitro glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays the inventors have now identified that the second and the third intracellular domains of the Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 subunit interact with the Src SH2 and the kinase domains, respectively. Functionally, these interactions keep Src in an inactive state, and binding of ouabain to this inactive Na+/K+-ATPase-Src complex frees and then activates the associated Src. These new examples show that the cellular Src-interacting Na+/K+-ATPase is now believed to play an important role in regulation of the basal Src activity and serve as a functional receptor for ouabain to stimulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in live cells. To test, the inventors developed an siRNA-based assay that allows us to determine the effect of changes in the amount and properties of the Na+/K+-ATPase on both basal and ouabain-stimulated Src activity.",

Transient transfection assay in human embryonic kidney 293T cells showed that expression of A4 siRNA resulted in over 40% decreases in the expression of the human \u03b11 subunit, whereas others gave 0 (A1 siRNA) to 20% (A1 and A3 siRNAs) reduction. Because the transfection efficiency was about 50% as indicated by the co-expressed EYFP, the inventors reasoned that A4 siRNA is effective in silencing the expression of endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase. Therefore, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with A4 siRNA expression vector (pSuppressor-A4 siRNA) and a puromycin selection marker (pBade-puro) either with or without pEYFP as described under \u201cExperimental Procedures.\u201d After two rounds of selection, the inventors collected 20 stable transfectants. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal (a6F) antibody showed that the expression of the \u03b11 subunit in these clones was significantly reduced in comparison with the control P-11 cells that were transfected with empty vector (pSuppressor) and selected. In contrast, cell clones (e.g. A1) obtained from the LLC-PK1 cells that were transfected with A1 siRNA expressed \u03b11 at a level comparable to that in P-11 cells (see FIG. 26 Table 2).",

As shown in FIG. 11A, expression of the \u03b11 subunit was significantly reduced in A4-11, TCN23-19, and PY-17 cells. Of these cell lines, the PY-17 cells, which were cloned by using the co-expressed EYFP as a marker, expressed the lowest level of the Na+/K+-ATPase.",
                                "Table 2 in FIG. 26 shows the quantitative data on the relative amount of the \u03b11 in these and other cell lines the inventors generated. Because control Western blot using purified Na+/K+-ATPase prepared from pig kidney showed that it was only possible to perform reasonable quantitative assay comparing two samples with less than 6-fold differences in the amount of \u03b11 (data not shown), the inventors measured the relative amount of \u03b11 in these cells by comparing A4-11 with the control P-11 and then TCN23-19 and PY-17 with A4-11. To confirm the above Western blot data, the inventors also probed the blots with a different anti-Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 monoclonal antibody (clone C464.6) and an anti-Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 polyclonal antibody, showing essentially the same results as in FIG. 11A. In addition, when co-cultured P-11 and PY-17 cells were immunostained using anti-Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 antibody (clone C464.6), the inventors found that the green PY-17 cells exhibited no detectable expression of the \u03b11, whereas the plasma membrane of control P-11 cells was clearly labeled by the antibody (FIG. 11B). To be sure that knock down of the \u03b11 subunit does not induce the expression of other isoforms, the inventors analyzed the cell lysates for both \u03b12 and \u03b13 and found no detectable signals in the above cell lines.",

                                "The PY-17 cells have very low endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase and are useful for studying the structure-function properties of the Na+/K+-ATPase when the cells are rescued by knocking in an exogenous \u03b11. To confirm, the inventors first made silent mutations of the rat \u03b11 cDNA to change the siRNA-targeted sequence. The inventors then transfected PY-17 cells with the mutated rat \u03b11 expression vector (pRc/CMV \u03b11AACm1) and generated several stable transfectants. Further analysis of the clone AAC-19 showed that these cells, unlike both P-11 and PY-17, expressed rat \u03b11 (FIG. 12A).",
                                "When the same blots were analyzed for total \u03b11 using the monoclonal antibody (a6F), the inventors found that AAC-19 cells expressed an amount of \u03b11 comparable to that in control P-11 cells (FIG. 12A). This result was further confirmed by immunostaining of the co-cultured P-11 and AAC-19 cells using anti-\u03b11 (clone C464.6) antibody. As depicted in FIG. 12B, the green AAC-19 and control P-11 cells exhibited similar levels of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the plasma membrane. Control experiments also demonstrated that the rat \u03b11 was stably expressed in this cell line for at least 20 passages in the absence of ouabain. Functionally knock-in of the rat \u03b11 into PY-17 cells was able to restore Na+/K+-ATPase activity (see FIG. 27\u2014Table 3). Also, it shifted the doseresponse curve of ouabain on the ATPase activity and made the rescued cells less ouabain-sensitive. In fact, the rescued cells behave as rat cell lines that express only the \u03b11 isoform (FIG. 13). It is important to note that PY-17 cells were as sensitive to ouabain as the control P-11 cells and that 10 \u03bcM ouabain caused a complete inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase.",

                                "The in vitro studies showed that the Na+/K+-ATPase directly binds and keeps Src in an inactive state. The inventors herein now believe that this mode of regulation operates in live cells and that reduction of intracellular Na+/K+-ATPase will decrease the interaction, resulting in an increase in basal Src activity. To test, the inventors measured the phosphorylation of Src (Tyr(P)418-Src), indicative of Src activation, in the cell lysates from the above cell lines.",
                                "As depicted in FIG. 14A, the expression of total Src was not altered by knockdown of the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase. However, the levels of active Src were significantly increased in A4-11, TCN23-19, and PY-17 cells. Interestingly, the increase in Src activity appeared to be inversely correlated with the amounts of Na+/K+-ATPase expressed in these cells (FIG. 14B).",
                                "These findings were further confirmed by immunostaining the cells with anti-Tyr(P)418-Src antibody, showing that TCN23-19 cells contained much more active Src than P-11 cells contained (FIG. 14C). It is important to note that there was no difference in the amount of active Src between two control cell lines, P-11 and A1 cells.",
                                "To test whether the increase in Src activity due to the decreased expression of the Na+/K+-ATPase is reversible upon repletion of the Na+/K+-ATPase, the inventors determined the total Src and the active Src in AAC-19 cells. As depicted in FIGS. 12A-B, AAC-19 cells were derived from the rat \u03b11-transfected PY-17 cells and expressed an amount of the Na+/K+-ATPase comparable to that in control P-11 cells. Although knock-in of the rat \u03b11 did not change the total Src in AAC-19 cells, it did reduce the level of the active Src to that seen in control P-11 cells (FIGS. 15A and 15B).",
                                "As illustrated in Table 3 in FIG. 27, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity was reduced 80% in PY-17 cells. When intracellular Na+ was measured after the cells were incubated in 22Na+ (0.5 \u03bcCi/ml) medium for 60 min to fully equilibrate exchangeable intracellular Na+ with 22Na+ (15), the inventors found that the steady state intracellular Na+ in PY-17 cells was about twice as much as in P-11 cells. To be sure that changes in Src activity observed in AAC-19 cells are not due to the restoration of the functional Na+/K+-ATPase and subsequent decreases in intracellular Na+, the inventors tested whether knock-in of a pumping-null mutant of the rat \u03b11 is sufficient for the observed interaction between the Na+/K+-ATPase and Src PY-17 cells were transiently transfected with either silently mutated wild-type rat \u03b11 (pRc/CMV \u03b11AACm1) or the rat \u03b11 pumping-null mutant (D371E).",
                                "As shown in FIG. 15C, expression of either rat \u03b11 or the mutant reduced active Src in PY-17 cells. To further confirm, the inventors also transiently transfected TCN23-19 cells with the EYFP-fused rat \u03b11 mutant expression vector (pEYFP-D371E) and immunostained for active Src. As depicted in FIG. 15D, the cells expressing the rat \u03b11 mutant had much less active Src in comparison with the untransfected TCN23-19 cells. These data show that the pumping-null Na+/K+-ATPase mutant is still able to interact and regulate Src. To further confirm, the inventors also performed FRET analysis in TCN23-19 cells transiently transfected with EYFP-rat \u03b11 mutant (D371E) and Src-ECFP expression vectors.",
                                "As depicted in FIG. 16A, the pumping-null mutant was targeted to the plasma membrane. When FRET was measured in these transfected cells by acceptor photobleaching protocol, an energy transfer from SrcECFP to EYFP-D371E was clearly demonstrated (FIG. 16B). The FRET efficiency measured from a total of 20 cells in three separate experiments ranged from 10.4 to 15.6 (13.2\u00b11.4). These data indicate that the pumping-null Na+/K+-ATPase acts like the wildtype \u03b11 (10) and can interact with Src to form a signaling complex. This conclusion is further supported by the co-immunoprecipitation assay showing that the rat \u03b11 mutant could be co-precipitated by anti-Src antibody (FIG. 16C).",
                                "FAK is a known Src effector that plays an important role in regulation of cell migration and proliferation. Activation of Src stimulates phosphorylation of FAK Tyr925, which subsequently can lead to the activation of RDK1/2. To examine whether an increase in basal Src activity can result in the activation of Src effectors, the inventors measured tyrosine phosphorylation of FaK in \u03b11 knockdown cells. As depicted in FIG. 17A, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed by anti-FAK antibody. The data clearly showed that the \u03b11 knockdown was capable of increasing the amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK. Specifically, when cell lysates were probed for Tyr(P)925-FAK, the inventors found a significant increase in Tyr(P)925-FAK in both A4-11 and PY-17 cells (FIG. 17B). Interestingly, when total ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 were measured, the inventors found a modest increase in the amount of active ERK1/2 in PY-17 cells (FIG. 17C). This is in accordance with the known function of Tyr(P)925-FAK (19, 20). This increase in Tyr(P)925 was sensitive to Src inhibitor PP2 (FIG. 17D). It is important to note that the FAK phosphorylation correlated well to the levels of active Src in the PP2-treated knockdown cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the increased Src activity due to the \u03b11 knockdown can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Src effectors. This is further supported by the observation that expression of the pumping-null mutant (D371E) not only restored the basal Src activity but also reduced FAK Tyr925 phosphorylation in PY-17 cells (FIG. 17E).",

                                "Because the Na+/K+-ATPase-Src complex serves as a functional receptor for ouabain to induce Src activation and subsequent stimulation of ERK1/2, the above examples led the inventors to test whether knockdown of the Na+/K+-ATPase affects ouabain-activated signal transduction.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 18A, although ouabain activated Src in P-11 cells, this effect of ouabain was essentially abolished in PY-17 cells, whereas a significant reduction was observed in A4-11 cells. To be sure that this inhibition is not due to nonspecific defects in receptor signal transduction, the inventors also measured the effect of EGF on Src. The inventors found that epidermal growth factor was able to stimulate SrcTyr(P)418 in both P-11 and PY-17 cells (2.5\u00b10.3-fold increase in P-11 versus 1.7\u00b10.2-fold increase in PY-17, n=3). Consistent with the findings on Src, the inventors also failed to detect any ouabain-induced change in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PY-17 cells (FIG. 18B).",
                                "In contrast, epidermal growth factor was able to stimulate ERK1/2 in PY-17 cells. These data support the notion that the Na+/K+-ATPase is indeed the receptor for ouabain-induced signal transduction. This notion is further supported by the findings presented in FIGS. 18 C and 18D, showing that knock-in of the rat \u03b11 not only restored the ouabain responses but also shifted the dose-response curve to the right in AAC-19 cells.",

                                "Manipulation of the Cellular Na+/K+-ATPase Content by RNA Interference Assays",
                                "RNA interference is a cellular mechanism that was first discovered in 1998 in Caenorhabditis elegans and refers to the post-transcriptional gene silencing by double-stranded RNA-triggered degradation of a homologous mRNA. This has now been developed as a powerful tool for artificially silencing a specific gene in a variety of biological systems including cultured cells and whole organisms. Using the strategy developed by Paul et al. (2002) and transient transfection assay, the inventors identified that A4 siRNA was effective for silencing the \u03b11 expression. Thus, the inventors transfected pig LLC-PK1 cells with the A4 siRNA expression vector and cloned several stable cell lines. Western blot analysis and immunostaining assay showed that the expression of the \u03b11 in the cloned cell lines was significantly reduced (FIGS. 11 and 12 and FIG. 26\u2014Table 2). For example, the \u03b11 in PY-17 cells is only about 8% of that in control P-11 cells. Functional analysis revealed that depletion of the \u03b11 resulted in an 80% reduction in ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity in PY-17 cells (FIG. 27\u2014Table 3). The inventors have now developed an effective protocol for silencing the expression of endogenous \u03b11 in cultured cells.",
                                "To test whether the \u03b11-depleted cells can be used to study the signaling functions of an exogenous/mutant \u03b11, the inventors transfected PY-17 cells with a rat \u03b11 expression vector in which A4 siRNA targeted sequence was silently mutated. By taking advantage of the availability of an antibody that specifically reacts with rat \u03b11, the inventors demonstrate herein that the exogenous rat \u03b11 can be knocked in and that the expression of rat \u03b11 restored not only the total cellular Na+/K+-ATPase protein but also the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Also, the rat \u03b11-rescued cells (AAC-19) exhibited the same ouabain sensitivity as the rat cell lines that only express the Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 subunit (FIG. 13). Taken together, the data indicate that the inventors have developed an effective protocol for manipulating cellular Na+/K+-ATPase. This protocol offers additional advantages over the widely used ouabain selection protocol for expression of mutated Na+/K+-ATPase in ouabain-sensitive cell lines (23-26).",
                                "First, the present protocol makes it possible to deplete endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase, allowing the investigators to study the effects of decreases in Na+/K+-ATPase expression on cellular function.",
                                "Second, the present protocol does not require using ouabain to force the expression of the transfected Na+/K+-ATPase. This is important in view of recent studies showing that ouabain stimulates the signaling function of the Na+/K+-ATPase and induces the endocytosis of the enzyme.",
                                "Third, the present protocol is useful for determining the exogenous/mutant Na+/K+-ATPase in the cells that have very low (less than 10%) endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase.",
                                "Fourth, the identified A4 siRNA are useful for silencing the \u03b11 expression in cells derived from species other than human and pig because the human \u03b11 cDNA sequence (nucleotide 2293 to nucleotide 2312) [SEQ ID NO: 38] targeted by A4 siRNA is conserved among all identified \u03b11 subunits (but not other isoforms) from fish to human.",
                                "Fifth, rescuing PY-17 cells with different isoforms of Lp the Na+/K+-ATPase provides a way to uncover the isoform-specific signaling functions.",
                                "A Pool of Src-Interacting Na+/K+-ATPase",
                                "The Na+/K+-ATPase resides in caveolae with Src. FRET analysis indicates that the signaling Na+/K+-ATPase and Src are likely to interact and form a functional receptor complex. In vitro binding assay demonstrates that the \u03b11 subunit and Src can interact directly via multiple domains and that the interaction keeps Src in an inactive state. The inventors now believe that there is an Src-interacting pool of Na+/K+-ATPase that not only regulates the basal Src activity, but also serves as a receptor for ouabain to stimulate Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple effectors.",
                                "First, because the signaling Na+/K+-ATPase binds and keeps Src in an inactive state, the inventors now believe that reduction of the endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase would deplete the Src-interacting pool of Na+/K+-ATPase, thus resulting in the Src activation. Indeed, as shown in FIG. 14, the \u03b11 knockdown cells contain more active Src than the control P-11 cells. It is important to mention that the \u03b11 knockdown did cause a significant increase in intracellular Na+ concentration in PY-17 cells. However, when intracellular Ca2+ was measured by fura-2, the steady state Ca2+ in PY-17 cells was comparable to that in P-11 cells. Thus, it is unlikely that increases in Src activity are due to changes in intracellular Na+ or Ca2+.",
                                "Second, when the \u03b11 knockdown PY-17 cells were rescued by the rat \u03b11, the inventors observed that the knock-in of the rat \u03b11 was sufficient to replete the pool of Src-interacting Na+/K+-ATPase, leading to the restoration of basal Src activity.",
                                "Third, because the present described in vitro binding assay shows that the third intracellular domain of the \u03b11 interacts and inhibits Src activity, the inventors now believe that a pumping-null mutant of the rat \u03b11 should be able to bind and inhibit Src in live cells. Indeed, the inventors found that knock-in of rat \u03b11 mutant D371E into PY-17 cells was also able to replete this Src-interacting pool of Na+/K+-ATPase and reduce the amount of active Src (FIG. 15).",
                                "In addition, both FRET analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the pumping-null mutant could interact with Src in live cells (FIG. 16). Because expression of the pumping-null mutant would not reduce intracellular Na\u2032 concentration in PY-17 cells, these data also indicate that the Na+/K+-ATPase can interact and regulate Src independently of changes in intracellular Na+ concentration.",
                                "FAK is involved in regulation of cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell migration. It is also one of the effectors of Src. Binding of active Src to FAK leads to full activation of FAK and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK Tyr925, which results in the assembly of several downstream signaling modules including the activation of ERK1/2. The inventors found that depletion of cellular Na+/K+-ATPase not only activated Src but also stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Inhibition of Src by either PP2 or knock-in of a pump-null \u03b11 mutant reduced Tyr(P)925-FAK in PY-17 cells (FIG. 17). Consistently, the inventors have also observed that ouabain stimulated Src and subsequently FAK in the control LLC-PK1 cells. These findings are significant. First, they support the notion that the Na+/K+-ATPase is an important regulator of protein kinases. Second, the regulatory effects of the Na+/K+-ATPase on Src and Src effector FAK depend on the ability of the Na+/K+-ATPase to interact with proteins, but not to pump ions. Third, the \u03b11 depletion-induced Src activation is capable of generating downstream pathways. The inventors also note that FAK plays a key role in regulation of cell motility and that depletion of \u03b11 in epithelial cells affects the formation of tight junctions and cell motility. Thus, the inventors now believe that the role of \u03b11 depletion and subsequent activation of FAK in the regulation of cell migration are important.",
                                "Ouabain-induced signal transduction appears to be initiated by the activation of Src. Because ouabain uses the Na+/K+-ATPase-Src complex as a functional receptor, the inventors now believe that the ouabain-induced activation of Src should correlate with the size of the pool of Src-interacting Na+/K+-ATPase. Indeed, the inventors found that the effect of ouabain on Src activation correlated inversely with cellular levels of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Although ouabain induced a modest activation of Src in A4-11 cells, it failed to activate Src in PY-17 cells. Because Src is required to transmit the ouabain signal to many downstream effectors, the examples herein further show that the a/K-ATPase-Src complex is the sole receptor for ouabain to provoke the protein kinase cascades. This is further supported by the following observations. First, rescuing PY-17 cells with the rat \u03b11 restored the effect of ouabain on Src and ERK1/2. Second, because the rescued cells expressed the ouabain-insensitive rat \u03b11, a much higher ouabain concentration was required to stimulate Src and subsequently ERK1/2 in AAC-19 cells (FIG. 18). Third, the inventors have developed a powerful protocol for manipulating the cellular Na+/K+-ATPase that has allowed further characterization of the signaling properties of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Fourth, these new findings show that the Na+/K+-ATPase is an important receptor capable of transmitting ouabain signals via protein kinases. Fifth, because Src is actively involved in control of cell growth, the inventors herein now show that there is a need for re-examining the issue of whether the Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated repression of Src and ouabain-provoked activation of Src play a role in cancer biology."
