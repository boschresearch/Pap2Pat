                        "Henceforth, for brevity the term \u201cwireless network\u201d is used to mean a \u201cwireless digital communication network\u201d and the terms are used interchangeably.",
                        "In the field of electromagnetics, the term \u201cbeam\u201d refers to a directional projection of electromagnetic energy radiating from a transmitting source, referred to as a transmitter. When a transmitter transmits an electromagnetic signal, henceforth a signal, the signal may be projected in more than one direction and comprise a plurality of such directional beams. A receiver may intercept some of these beams directly, when there is an open space, or direct line-of sight path, between the transmitter and the receiver. Some other of the plurality of beams may be reflected by one or more surfaces in the path of the signal, and the receiver may intercept some of the reflected beams. Some beams may be reflected more than once before intercepted by the receiver, each reflection referred to as a hop. In addition, some additional other of the plurality of beams may not be intercepted by the receiver, neither directly nor reflected.",
                        "Path loss is the reduction in power density (attenuation) of an electromagnetic wave as it propagates through a space. Myriad factors effect path loss, some factors being, but not limited to, terrain contours, environment (urban or rural, vegetation and foliage), distance between a transmitter and a receiver, reflections, and the height and location of transmitting and receiving antennas.",
                        "In free space, path loss is proportional to the square of the frequency of a carrier signal, thus implying that at an identified distance path loss using a carrier having an example frequency of 30 Giga Hertz (GHz) is wo times greater than path loss using another carrier having another example frequency of 3 GHz. In addition, when a beam of a signal is reflected, each reflection typically reduces the amount of energy that reaches the receiver.",
                        "As use of wireless networks increases, there is an increase in using higher frequency carrier signals where available bandwidth is greater. However, higher frequency carrier signals suffer greater path loss than lower frequency carrier signals, limiting a distance at which a receiver can intercept a signal from a transmitter. In addition, higher frequency carrier signals require a direct open space path between a transmitter and a receiver with few or no reflections.",
                        "The term \u201cmillimeter waves\u201d, abbreviated here within \u201cmmWave\u201d, refers to a range of electromagnetic waves having a wavelength measured between 10-1 millimeter. The limitations described above are significant for carrier signals having a frequency above 6 GHz, including mmWave carrier signals.",
                        "Using multiple antennas allows concentrating radiated electromagnetic energy of a transmitted signal along multiple spatial directions associated with an existing line of sight path with at most one reflected hop between the transmitter and the receiver. In the field of wireless communications, the term \u201cbeam alignment\u201d refers to aligning transmission of a beam (signal) along directions of a strongest path among multiple paths in multiple spatial directions, so as to increase the amount of electromagnetic energy of the signal intercepted by the receiver.",
                        "As used here within, the term \u201cwireless end device\u201d means a wireless communication device, capable of connecting to a wireless digital communication network for the purpose of sending and, additionally or alternatively, receiving digital data via the wireless digital communication network. Some examples of a wireless end device are a cellular phone, a tablet, a personal digital assistant device, a smart television, a personal computer and a mobile computer.",
                        "In some wireless networks the network is divided into a plurality of identified areas, known as cells. A base station is a wireless communication device that provides network communication coverage to a cell. The term massive MIMO refers to the use of a large amount of antennas at a base station. Such availability of many antennas permits creating almost orthogonal channels among the base station and a plurality of wireless end devices, including when using a common band of frequencies. A time-frequency slot is a time slot on a common carrier signal frequency (channel). Massive MIMO thus enables simultaneous transmission from the base station to several wireless end devices using the same time-frequency slot with a minimum amount of interference.",
                        "When a wireless end device is located between two or more cells, interference between a plurality of signals of a plurality of base stations of the two or more cells reduces the signal-to-noise ratio experienced by the wireless end device and there is a need to employ methods to decrease such spectral interference.",
                        "In the field of wireless communication, an access point is a networking hardware device that allows other wireless devices to connect to a communication network. A cell-free massive MIMO network is a massive MIMO network that uses, instead of a base station per cell, a plurality of distributed access points that simultaneously and jointly serve a plurality of wireless end devices, using a common time-frequency slot. Each of the plurality of wireless access points may have fewer antennas than a base station. Typically, a wireless access point is less complex than a base station as each of the plurality of wireless access points serves a smaller amount of wireless end devices than a base station in a cell-based massive MIMO."

                        "When a cell-free massive MIMO network uses high frequency carrier signals and particularly, but not limited to, mmWave carrier signals, there is a need to perform beam alignment for each of the plurality of wireless end devices.",
                        "There exist solutions for performing beam alignment for one wireless end device and a base station having a plurality of antennas. Such existing solutions assume there is no interference in the communication of the base station with the one wireless end device by communication between the base station and other wireless end devices. In addition, in some existing solutions the base station and wireless end device alternately have transmission and reception tasks, increasing an amount of time for performing beam alignment.",
                        "However, in a cell-free massive MIMO network there are a plurality of wireless end devices, and each wireless end device is typically served by one or more dedicated wireless access points. When a cell-free massive MIMO uses high frequency carrier signals and particularly, but not limited to, mmWave carrier signals, there is a need to perform beam alignment for each of the plurality of wireless end devices. There is a need to assign each of the plurality of wireless end devices one or more of the plurality of wireless access points to be served thereby, and to perform beam alignment for the plurality of wireless end devices simultaneously served by the plurality of wireless access points to reduce an amount of interference between the plurality of wireless access points when serving the plurality of wireless end devices.",
                        "For brevity, henceforth the term \u201caccess point\u201d is used to mean \u201cwireless access point\u201d, and the terms are used interchangeably. Similarly, the term \u201cend device\u201d is henceforth used to mean \u201cwireless end device\u201d and the terms are used interchangeably.",
                        "Each of the plurality of wireless end devices has an end device array of antennas. As a wireless end device may be handled by a person, for example hand-held by a person, an orientation of the array of antennas of the end device is not usually known and may change over time. In addition, while orientation of an array of antennas of an access point may be originally known, an access point's array of antennas may shift due to environment conditions, for example wind or collision of another object with the access point's array of antennas.",
                        "In addition, in some existing networks having multiple transmission-reception points (multi-TRP networks) network topology is fixed, limiting an ability of a network to adapt when a wireless end device moves. In addition, a transmission point is typically a relay with limited computational capabilities. Some existing beam alignment procedures in multi-TRP networks employ exhaustive search methods having a high computation complexity, sometimes beyond capabilities of a relay with limited computational capabilities.",
                        "To assign each of the plurality of end devices one or more of the plurality of access points and to perform beam alignment for each of the plurality of end devices, there is a need to know for each pair of access point and end device a strength of a signal from the access point intercepted by the end device. In addition, there is a need to know for each pair of access point and end device along which directions of transmission from the access point and directions of reception by the end device beams should be formed to enable communication between the access point and the end point, that is which directions result in a received signal sufficiently strong for the end device to intercept it (i.e. there is a need to perform beam alignment for each pair). Furthermore, there is a need to perform beam alignment without requiring an exhaustive search and without prior knowledge of orientation of arrays of antennas of the plurality of wireless end devices and additionally or alternatively of the plurality of wireless access points. In addition, to simultaneously perform beam alignment for a plurality of wireless access points and a plurality of end devices, there is a need to allow a wireless end device to discriminate between the plurality of access points without an identification value identifying an access point and without knowledge of the plurality of access points' respective positions relative to the end device and their respective transmit power.",
                        "To do so, some embodiments described here within propose a beam-alignment protocol based on a sequence of communication data-patterns, where each of the sequence of communication data-patterns is associated with one of a sequence of alignment subcarrier-frequency-slots. As used here within, a \u201csubcarrier-frequency\u201d is a frequency derived from a carrier frequency and modulated to send other information not sent on the carrier frequency. A \u201csubcarrier-frequency-slot\u201d is a time slot when using a subcarrier-frequency. An alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot is a subcarrier-frequency-slot used when performing beam alignment. Optionally, a data-pattern comprises a sequence of data channel frequencies, each data channel frequency associated with a transmission direction. Thus, in some embodiments each communication data-pattern comprises a sequence of subcarrier-frequencies, each associated with a transmission direction. Optionally, the sequence is of subcarrier-frequencies is a sequence in time, such that a signal transmitted according to the data-pattern has a variant frequency over time.",
                        "According to some embodiments, a manager of a wireless network configures each of a plurality of access points of the wireless network to send a beam-alignment signal in a subcarrier-frequency-slot of a sequence of alignment subcarrier-frequency-slots, where the beam-alignment signal is sent according to a communication data-pattern associated with the subcarrier-frequency-slot, and the subcarrier-frequency-slot is selected according to a slot indicator assigned by the manager to the access point. Thus, in such embodiments each of the plurality of access points is associated with one of subcarrier-frequency-slots.",
                        "In such embodiments, the manager configures each of a plurality of end devices of the wireless network to receive a plurality of beam-alignment signals from the plurality of access points, where each beam-alignment signal is received by the plurality of end devices in the respective alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot associated with the respective communication data-pattern of the beam-alignment signal. As each of the plurality of access points is associated with one of the sequence of alignment subcarrier-frequency-slots, a signal intercepted by an end device during an alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot is associated with the respective one or more access points associated with the alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot. Optionally, the manager associates each of the plurality of access points with one of the sequence of alignment subcarrier-frequency-slots such that a likelihood of an end device intercepting more than one signal sent by more than one access point is reduced, and thus for an end device each alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot is associated with one access point. This association allows an end device to discriminate between the plurality of access points according to the sequence of alignment subcarrier-frequency-slots. In addition, the manager optionally associates each of the plurality of access points with one of the sequence of alignment subcarrier-frequency-slots to minimize an amount of signal interference between a plurality of wireless signals transmitted simultaneously by the plurality of access points according to one or more signal quality metrics. A possible example of a signal quality metric is a mean average of signal interference between all pairs of access point and end device. Optionally, the manager associates each of the plurality of access points such that a distance between two access points associated with a common data-pattern is greater than a threshold distance. Optionally, the threshold distance is greater than a minimum distance determined such that interference between the two access points is reduced. Optionally, the sequence of communication data-patterns is selected from an identified plurality of communication data-patterns. The minimum distance may depend on an amount of data-patterns in the sequence of communication data-patterns relative to an amount of data-patterns in the identified plurality of communication data-patterns. When more data-patterns of the identified plurality of communication data-patterns are used in each sequence of communication data-patterns the minimum distance between the two access points is optionally increased, when possible, to reduce a likelihood of interference between the two access points.",
                        "Optionally, each of the plurality of end devices sends the manager a plurality of receive information records, one for each of the plurality of beam-alignment signals. Optionally, each receive information record is indicative of a quality of a best part of the respective beam-alignment signal associated with the receive information record. Some examples of a signal quality value indicative of a quality of part of a signal include, but are not limited to: an angle of arrival, an estimated angle of departure, and a signal strength indicator. Optionally, each receive information record is associated with the respective alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot in which the respective beam-alignment signal was received. Thus, each receive information record is optionally associated with the respective communication data-pattern associated with the respective alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot in which the respective beam-alignment signal was received. Furthermore, each receive information record is thus optionally associated with the respective access point that sent the respective beam-alignment signal during the respective alignment subcarrier-frequency-slot. Optionally, each end device sends the manager one receive information record and indicative of a plurality of signal qualities of a sequence of beam-alignment signals, each associated with one of the sequence of communication data-patterns. This association preserves an association between an indication of a signal quality of a best part of a beam-alignment signal and one of the plurality of access points.",
                        "Optionally, the manager receives the plurality of receive information records. Optionally, a receive information record indicative of a plurality of signal qualities comprises for each of the plurality of beam-alignment signals a direction of the strongest path of the respective communication data-pattern used to transmit the beam-alignment signals and a strength thereof. Optionally, the computation in the manager would merely comprise the association of each wireless end device with one or more of the plurality of access points. As each receive information record preserves an association between an indication of a signal quality of a best part of a beam-alignment signal and one of the plurality of access points, the manager receives in one sequence of subcarrier-frequency slots information from each of the plurality of end devices regarding signal quality of associated with each of the plurality of access points, without requiring multiple iterations of communication between the manager and each of the plurality of end devices, reducing an amount of time required to configure the wireless network.",
                        "Optionally, the manager computes a plurality of preferred communication channels according to the plurality of receive information records, each preferred communication channel for one of the plurality of access points for communication with one of the plurality of end devices. Optionally, a preferred communication channel comprises one or more subcarrier frequencies and one or more transmission directions. Optionally, the plurality of preferred communication channels minimizes an amount of interference between the plurality of communication channels according to at least one communication metric, for example by maximizing a receive signal strength of each of the plurality of communication channels. Computing the plurality of preferred communication channels to minimize an amount of interference between the plurality of communication channels increases utilization of the wireless network.",
                        "For at least one of the plurality of access points, the manager optionally configures the access point to communicate with at least one of the plurality of end devices using one of the preferred communication channels. Similarly, the manager optionally configures the at least one end device to communicate with the access point using the preferred communication channel.",
                        "Optionally, an access point sends a beam-alignment using a plurality of signals. Optionally, a wireless end device receives the beam-alignment signal using the plurality of data channel frequencies. Optionally, for example when a data-pattern comprises a sequence of data channel frequencies, each associated with a transmission direction, sending the beam-alignment signal in the subcarrier-frequency-slot comprises a plurality of data-pattern iterations executed consecutively in order of the sequence of data channel frequencies. Optionally, in each of the plurality of data-pattern iterations the access point transmits part of the beam-alignment signal using one of the sequence of data-channel frequencies in the respective transmission direction associated therewith, according to the order of the sequence of data channel frequencies. Using a data-pattern comprising a sequence of data channel frequencies, each associated with a transmission direction, allows using in one subcarrier-frequency-slot a plurality of data channel frequencies and a plurality of transmission directions, reducing an amount of time required to collect information required to perform beam alignment and thus reducing an amount of time required to configure the wireless network.",
                        "Optionally, one or more of the plurality of data channel frequencies is a mmWave frequency. Using a mmWave frequency when sending a beam-alignment signal allows one or more of the plurality of receive information records to be indicative of a signal quality when using the mmWave frequency and thus facilitates performing beam alignment for the mmWave frequency, increasing accuracy of a preferred communication channel computed using the plurality of receive information records and increasing utilization of the wireless network by using a communication channel having the mmWave frequency.",
                        "Optionally, the manager communicates with the plurality of end devices using a wireless control channel frequency, for example the manager may receive the plurality of receive information records using the wireless control channel frequency and additionally, or alternatively, initiate the protocol comprising sending a protocol initialization instruction to the plurality of end devices using the wireless control channel frequency. Optionally, the wireless control channel frequency is not a mmWave frequency. Using a wireless control channel frequency that is not a mmWave frequency increases likelihood of the manager communicating with the plurality of end devices without performing beam alignment for the wireless control channel frequency for each of the plurality of end devices.",
                        "Optionally, the manager communicates with at least some of the plurality of access points using another wireless control channel frequency, for example the manager may configure at least some of the plurality of access points using the other wireless control channel frequency and additionally, or alternatively, initiate the protocol comprising sending the protocol initialization instruction to the plurality of access points using the other wireless control channel frequency. Optionally, the other wireless control channel frequency is not a mmWave frequency. Using another wireless control channel frequency that is not a mmWave frequency increases likelihood of the manager communicating with at least some of the plurality of access points without performing beam alignment for the other wireless control channel frequency for each of the plurality of access points. Optionally, the manager is connected to at least some other of the plurality of access points via a wired digital communication network, for example an Ethernet network. When the manager is connected to the at least some other of the plurality of access points via the wired digital communication network, the manager optionally communicates with the at least some other of the plurality of access points via the wired digital communication network. Optionally, the manager is implemented in one of the plurality of access points.",
                        "Optionally, to configure the plurality of access points to transmit one of the sequence of beam-alignment signals, the manager computes an association between each of the plurality of access points and one of the sequence of communication data patterns. Optionally, computing the association comprises computing a plurality of centroid locations in an identified space wherein the plurality of access points is located. Optionally, in each of a plurality of association iterations, the manager clusters the plurality of access points in a plurality of clusters according to a respective distance from one of the plurality of centroid locations such that each of the plurality of clusters has a plurality of cluster access points of the plurality of access points. Optionally, in each of the plurality of association iterations the manager computes for each of the plurality of clusters a new centroid location having a common mean distance from each of the cluster's respective plurality of cluster access points. Optionally, the manager uses a plurality of new centroid locations, each computed for one of the plurality of clusters, as the plurality of centroid locations for a consecutive association iteration of the plurality of association iterations.",
                        "Optionally, the manager uses a last plurality of clusters computed in a last iteration of the plurality of association iterations to compute the association between the plurality of access points and the sequence of communication data patters. Optionally, for each of the sequence of communication data-patterns, the manager selects from each of the last plurality of clusters at most one access point from the cluster's respective plurality of cluster access points and associates the at most one access point with the sequence of communication data-patterns. Optionally, in each cluster of the last plurality of clusters each of the sequence of communication data-patterns is associated with one of the sequence of subcarrier-frequency-slots. Optionally, each of the last plurality of clusters has a unique sequence of communication data-patterns, selected from the identified plurality of communication data-patterns. Associating a unique sequence of communication data-patterns with each of the last plurality of clusters allows reducing a likelihood of two access points using a common data pattern during a common subcarrier-frequency-slot, reducing a likelihood of interference between the two access points and thus increasing accuracy of one or more receive information records computed by one or more of the plurality of end devices, increasing accuracy of the plurality of preferred communication channels and increasing network utilization of the wireless network.",
