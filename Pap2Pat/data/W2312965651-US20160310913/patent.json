    "abstract": "The disclosure regards to the porous materials, concerning a flexible 2D single-layer supramolecular polymer and its application in precise nano size separation. It comprises the synthesis of a bolaform cationic molecule, preparation of a cationic bridging stick, a flexible 2D single-layer supramolecular polymer and supramolecular polymer membrane, and the application of the membrane in precise nano-size separation. A synergetic ionic self-assembly approach which is facile, convenient and based on the ionic bond without preferential direction is used to construct a flexible 2D single-layer supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, its distinctive properties such as uniform nanoporous structure and flexibility offer an unprecedented opportunity to fabricate ultrafiltration membrane towards precise nanosize separation.",

AFM images demonstrate that the supramolecular polymers appear as very thin micrometer-scale sheets with an average height from 1.43 to 1.48 nm (FIGS. 5 and 6), in perfect agreement with the interlayer spacing of 1.49 nm measured by powder XRD pattern of the freeze-dried supramolecular polymer sample (FIG. 9a). Considering the accord of this value with the diameter (1.46 nm) of a CD ring, 2D single-layer supramolecular polymers can be rationally inferred. And HRTEM images further demonstrate the micrometer-scale sheets of the 2D single-layer supramolecular polymers (FIGS. 7 and 8). Due to the electron density contrast between organic and inorganic components, the inorganic clusters can be well discerned as dark spots with long-range uniform orthogonal mesh-like structure with edge length around 3.7 nm in the single-layer sheet. This fantastic orthogonal framework structure was further identified by XRD pattern measurement (FIG. 9b). The diffraction pattern of the sample film prepared by the filtration of the supramolecular polymer [Azo-TrEG@CD]2[PWV] exhibits nine diffraction peaks, which can be perfectly indexed into an in-layer lamellar structure with 3.7 nm of spacing, in perfect accord with the HRTEM results.

The filtrate was monitored by emission spectrum (FIG. 11) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (FIG. 12). After filtration by using Tr-membrane, the photographs show the orange luminescence turns green; furthermore, a 10-nm blue-shifting(\u03bbmax=523 nm) of the emission band occurs in the filtrate with a separation efficiency of 73.4%; meanwhile, the HRTEM images demonstrate the size of QDs in the filtrate become smaller; indicative of which only the QDs with small size have passed through the Tr-membrane, while the larger size part were blocked by the membrane. Similar separation experiments of differently sized QDs were conducted by using the Tr-membrane or Te-membrane (FIGS. 13-18 and 23-26, see Examples)."

HRTEM was conducted on a JEOL JEM 2010 electron microscope under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV without staining During the measurement, longer exposure time to the high-energy electron beam would destroy the framework structure, resulting in less ordered structures. Thus the HRTEM images were tracked within a quite short irradiation time. Moreover, in order to obtain a clear high contrast image, we used a smart camera technique for image collection, which was based on continuous acquisition of images to get high image contrast. Due to the heating disturbance of the sample during the electron beam irradiation, the image superposition brought slight ghosting phenomenon, which causes the size of inorganic clusters seemed larger than their ideal dimension. Two samples of the synthesized 2D single-layer supramolecular polymers were surveyed, and long-range uniform orthogonal mesh-like structure in the sheets can be observed in the surveyed samples.
