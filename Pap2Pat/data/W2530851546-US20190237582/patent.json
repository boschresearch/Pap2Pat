                        "For decades, solar energy has been a leading technology in the search to replace fossil-fuel energy as a sustainable and clean energy source. However, cost and efficiency remain as major concerns. As the price of photovoltaics (PV) modules has dropped, the inverters for energy converters now count for more than 10% of the total cost of an entire PV system. Additionally, in a conventional PV system all solar modules link to a central inverter; therefore, the overall system performance can be brought down by an underperforming module in the array or individual solar cells blocked from sunlight.",
                        "To solve this problem, and to optimize each individual solar panel, the micro-inverter technology has been proposed to embed inverters into each photovoltaic module. However, at the present time, the cost of micro-inverters is still higher than the cost of centralized inverters in small systems (\u226410 kW). Another major factor hindering the wide adoption of solar energy is a conflict between aesthetics and energy saving. Many consumers find the placement of arrays of solar panels on buildings to be unsightly.",
                        "Consequently ways of integrating photovoltaics into buildings, i.e. Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have been proposed. BIPVs serve as building elements so that the appearance of houses won't be compromised due to the post-installation of solar panels. To address these two major issues, it is desired to have inverters which can be integrated with solar modules to form a transparent solar PV system on glass (PV-SOG). In a PV-SOG, in addition to inverters, all other components including solar cells and controller circuits can be designed using the same process. Therefore, not only the cost but also the unit size of a PV system is reduced. The transparency and scalability of the PV-SOG's exterior appearance make them attractive for application to BIPVs. Moreover, PV-SOG's possess better system reliability since every solar module is integrated with an individual inverter or inverter array.",
                        "The high voltage devices are the core of the inverters. Currently, state-of-the-art high voltage and high power devices use the popular SiC and GaN transistors. However, both of these wide bandgap semiconductors require epitaxial growth at high temperature on strictly selected single-crystal substrates, which excludes their application in SOGs. In contrast, thin film transistor (TFT) technology made at low temperature has become a promising candidate for PV-SOG. Several semiconductor materials have been tried out to make high voltage thin film transistor (HVTFT) devices. Amorphous Si and poly-Si HVTFTs have been studied since the 1980s. Although amorphous Si can provide high voltage up to 800 V; however, its poor performance (on/off ratio \u02dc104) due to its low mobility limits its application. Poly-Si HVTFTs show better driving capability, but their low blocking voltage and non-uniformity from grain boundaries make them inadequate to meet the requirements of PV-SOG. In addition, Si-based TFT technology suffers from the absorption of visible light, restricting its application for transparent electronics. Organic TFTs which offer low cost and low process temperature have been used in display and RFID technologies. A high-voltage organic thin-film transistor (HVOTFT) has been reported to show switch drain-to-source voltages higher than 300 V with a controlling voltage range from 0 to 20 V. However, its low mobility, poor long-term stability and degradation at higher temperatures exclude its application in PV-SOGs, which operate under sunlight radiation, and its lifetime, like the regular residential solar cells, is expected to be more than 25 years.",
                        "Since the report of Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) TFTs with high electrical performance at low process temperature, oxide semiconductor TFTs have emerged in many applications, especially in displays, and transparent electronics. In the area of HVTFT, it was reported that an IGZO HVTFT operated at above 100 V with an on/off current ratio of 107. Although this is beyond the regular operating voltage in TFTs, it is still not sufficient to be used in inverters for a solar PV system. Furthermore, it is desired to use indium-free materials due to the high cost of indium, especially in the case of large-area electronic systems such as solar cells. In addition, the toxicity of IGZO due to its high indium concentration is of considerable environmental concern.",
                        "A need thus exists to develop a new HVTFT on glass technology for the micro-inverters which can be integrated with solar modules to form the PV-SOG. It is also desirable to provide HVTFTs for various high voltage applications at low cost, such as self-powered smart glass."

As performance criteria change, other ranges, characteristics and materials may be substituted, as known by those familiar with semiconductor device physics and technology.",
                        "To improve the TFT stability, including the thermal, threshold voltage, and especially the negative bias stress (NBS) stability, a small amount of Mg composition (x) is doped into ZnO to form MgXZn1-XO (MZO, 0<x\u22640.05) as the TFT channel to reduce the density of oxygen vacancies in MZO.",
                        "To improve the electric field uniformity thus, enabling the high blocking voltage, the HVTFT in the illustrated embodiment has a circular-symmetric design: the channel (ring), source (ring), gate (ring), and drain (circle) have a concentric circular shape.",

In the illustrated embodiments y decreases from 1.0 (MgO) at the interface with gate dielectric layer to the same Mg composition value x (0<x\u22640.05) at the interface with the MgxZn1-xO (MZO) channel layer.",
                        "In the illustrated embodiments, the transition layer (TL) has a thickness ranging from 5 nm to 15 nm. The optimized thickness is determined by considering that the TL has the sufficient thickness to serve as the diffusion barrier to effectively block the Zn diffusion from MZO channel to SiO2 gate dielectric; however, the TL is thin enough to have proper turn-on voltage and current.",
                        "In the illustrated embodiments, the channel length (distance between source and drain), the first offset distance between the gate and the drain, and the second offset distance between the gate and the source are designed and balanced to reach the required blocking voltage and on-current. For example, in some embodiments, the distance between source and drain is ranged by 5 to 30 \u03bcm. In some embodiments, the first offset distance LGD between the gate and the drain ranges from 3 to 25 \u03bcm and the second offset distance LGS between the gate and the source ranges from 2 to 5 \u03bcm, respectively. The Gate-Drain Offset LGD is longer than the Gate-Source Offset region LGS because in the HVTFT the high voltage bias is added on the drain terminal. Therefore, larger gate-drain offset assure to sustain high voltage bias. In all cases, however, because of the concentric arrangement of the gate, source and drain, each offset distance remains constant once it is determined.",

                        "An aspect of the invention provides a Magnesium zinc oxide-based high voltage thin film transistor (MZO-HVTFT). The MZO-HVTFT includes a substrate, a ring-shaped gate over the substrate, a circular dielectric insulating layer deposited and patterned over the gate, a MgyZn1-yO transition layer (MZO-TL) over the dielectric insulating layer, a channel layer containing Magnesium zinc oxide deposited and then patterned over the insulating layer, and a source and a drain concentric with the gate electrode over the channel. Further, a passivation layer is disposed on a top surface of the channel layer to protect the MZO HVTFT from ambient influence.",
                        "The dielectric insulating layer is made from a material including for example, SiO2, Al2O3, HfO2, AlN, and any combination thereof. The dielectric insulating layer can also be configured to contain a stack structure formed by a plurality of layers which contain the above materials.",
                        "In the illustrated embodiments, the channel layer contains MgxZn1-xO wherein the Mg composition value x is limited in a range of (0<x\u22640.05). The traditional TFTs using the pure ZnO (x=0) as a channel suffer from the stability issues including the threshold voltage shift and thermal instability, which would hinder its use as an inverter. By introducing a proper amount of Magnesium (Mg) into ZnO to form ternary MgxZn1-xO (MZO) (0<x\u22640.05) as the TFT channel material, oxygen vacancy in the channel layer is suppressed. Concomitantly, a small amount of Mg in MZO will not introduce the significant alloy scattering and disorder. Therefore MZO with the proper Mg composition as the channel layer keeps the high electron mobility of ZnO material, however overcomes the instability issues accompanied with pure ZnO.",
                        "In the illustrated embodiments, the channel layer is not in direct contact with the gate dielectric insulating layer. A transition layer containing MgyZn1-yO (x\u2264y\u22641.0) is incorporated between the channel layer and the gate dielectric insulating layer, where y is continuously decreased from 1.0 (MgO) at the interface with the insulating layer to the x at the interface with the MgxZn1-xO (MZO) (0<x\u22640.05) channel layer. The addition of such a transition layer significantly improves the subthreshold slope and on-current values. More importantly as shown in the examples, it enables higher blocking voltage with a high on/off ratio, and a higher operating voltage than conventional TFTs.",
                        "The HVTFT has the unique design with the circular shape: the channel, drain and source all have concentric circular shape. This design minimizes non-uniform electrical field distribution as seen in traditional rectangular channel and improves the blocking voltage of the MZO-HVTFT.",
                        "The transition layer serves as a barrier against Zn diffusion so the interface states and trapped charges are reduced. This improvement leads to the decrease of the maximum electrical field near the channel-gate dielectric interface, resulting in the increase of blocking voltage. Preferably, the magnesium zinc oxide in the transition layer has a decreasing gradient of zinc from the interface with the insulating layer to the interface with the channel layer.",
                        "The electrode can be transparent contact electrodes containing transparent conductive oxides. Suitable oxides include, but not limited to the Ga-doped ZnO (GZO), Al-doped ZnO (AZO), Flourine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO), and any combination thereof. The ring-shape bottom gate, the circular drain contact, the ring-shape source contact are preferably highly conductive electrodes with low-contact resistivity.",
                        "The thickness of the transition layer is designed in the range from about 5 nm to about 15 nm. It is thick enough as the diffusion barrier to suppress the Zn diffusion; however, it is also thin enough to assure the sufficient on-current value. There is a trade-off between blocking capability and driving capability in the MZO HVTFT. As the channel length increases, the blocking voltage increases; however, the on-current drops. The channel length L, which is defined by the space between source and the drain is designed to be for example, about 5 to about 30 \u03bcm.",
                        "A ring as an offset is defined between the edge of the drain and the closest edge of the gate as shown in FIG. 1. A first offset distance (LGD) is defined as the distance between the edge of the drain and the closest edge of the gate. Similarly, a second offset is defined between the edge of the source and the adjacent edge of the gate. A second offset distance (LGS) is defined as the distance between the edge of the source and the closest edge of the gate. The gate of HVTFT is designed as not being centered below the channel as the conventional TFT. The gate-drain offset region LGD is longer than the gate-source offset region LGS. This design meets the HVTFT's standard bias condition, wherein the high voltage bias is added on the drain terminal. Therefore, larger gate-drain area is needed to sustain high voltage bias. In some embodiments, the gate and drain offset LGD is designed to be in the range of 3 to about 25 m. The offset distance between the gate and source LGS ranges from about 2 to about 5 m. In some embodiments, the gate electrode, the source and the drain are arranged in a concentric alignment.",
                        "In some embodiments, the substrate is a transparent material such as glass. In some embodiments the substrate can be disposed on a structural component of a building such as a tile, a roof, or a wall. Alternatively, the substrate can be incorporated into a tile, a roof or a wall for BIPV. Another aspect of the invention provides an article of manufacture containing the MZO-HVTFT described herein. Advantages of the HVTFT of the present invention include low cost materials and manufacturing, high blocking voltage (over 600V), improved energy efficiency, improved thermal stability and NBS stability, easy incorporation into various instruments or systems requiring transparent circuitry able to operate at high voltage.",
                        "Inverters based on present HVTFT can be integrated with a solar module to form a transparent solar PV system on glass (PV-SOG). Transparent inverters also makes a solar PV system more scalable and make PV-SOG exterior appearance friendly, therefore, it could be a strong candidate for the building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Unlike the conventional solar panel which is separately installed on roofs after completion of the building, BIPV serves as building elements so that the appearance of houses won't be compromised due to the post-installation of the solar panels.",
                        "The transparent PV-SOG can also be integrated with self-powered smart glass technology, such as windows and windshield of automobiles, and it won't affect the safety, appearance just like BIPV. This solar unit can serve as backup battery for emergency and energy source for other system, such entertainment, GPS navigation, etc.",

For example, in flat-panel x-ray imaging systems, a high voltage potential is built by the sensing layer, such as ZnO or amorphous-Si layers, and the regular TFTs easily burn down at such voltage range. ZnO has superior radiation hardness. Thus, the MZO based HVTFTs not only operate at high voltage but also have great radiation hardness from intrinsic characteristics, so they can be used in the readout circuit even without extra protection. Also, the detecting system can be integrated just like PV-SOG, so it is possible to build a portable self-scan X-ray detector system, including a pixel electrode for charge collection, a capacitor for charge storage, and a HVTFT circuit for image readout.

Compared with ZnO HVTFT, MZO HVTFT shows a better subthreshold slope (S.S.) and on-current. The most significant improvement of the MZO over the pure ZnO channel layer is in its thermal stability, which is one of the critical requirements for high voltage devices being integrated into PV-SOGs. By measuring the transfer characteristics of HVTFTs at different temperatures, the shifts of threshold voltage (Vth) are compared in FIG. 2b. As temperature increases from 294 K (room temperature) to 367 K, MZO HVTFT only shows a threshold voltage shift \u0394Vth of \u22126 V in comparison to \u0394Vth of \u221210.5 V in the pure ZnO counterpart. This negative shift of threshold voltage at higher temperatures results from the thermally activated electrons from the trap states located in the channel and in the interface between the channel and gate dielectric SiO2.",

The steeper falling rate (0.177 eV/V) of the MZO HVTFT, as opposed to that of the ZnO HVTFT (0.107 eV/V), indicates that the MZO TFT has a lower trap density. Because both MZO and ZnO HVTFTs are fabricated on the same SiO2 gate dielectric layer, the interface trap densities of the two devices are similar. Therefore, the improvement of thermal stability in MZO HVTFT over ZnO HVTFT is mainly attributed to the reduction of traps in the bulk channel. In fact, the Mg\u2014O has a stronger bonding than Zn\u2014O, resulting in the lower density of oxygen vacancy in the MZO channel than that of the pure ZnO channel.",
                                "In the comparison between MZO HVTFT and m-MZO HVTFT, it was found that the later shows an order higher of on-current and a steeper S.S. than the MZO counterpart. The steepest falling rate (0.246 eV/V) of the activation energy of the drain current suggests a nearly 40% lower total trap density in m-MZO HVTFT than in MZO HVTFT. Since both of MZO and m-MZO HVTFTs are made up of the same MZO channel and SiO2 gate dielectric layer, these differences in characteristics between the two HVTFTs mainly result from the different interface properties between the channel and gate dielectric layer. Specifically, the unique interface design and engineering using modulation doping of Mg in m-MZO HVTFT reduces the interface trap density. Therefore, the total trap density in m-MZO HVTFT is lower than in the MZO HVTFT. MgyZn1-yO transition layer (MZO-TL) as a diffusion barrier",

FIGS. 3a and 3b show the images of the interface regions in MZO and m-MZO HVTFT samples, respectively. As shown in the inset of FIGS. 3a, the gray dots are observed only in the SiO2 dielectric layer of the MZO HVTFT sample. To identify these dots, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the elemental composition of the films at different positions (point \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d) across the interface. As shown in the dashed box of FIG. 3c, the Zn peak in MZO HVTFT appears not only in the MZO channel area (point A) but also near the interface (point B) and even inside the gate dielectric SiO2 layer (point C). The EDS results further confirm that the observed gray dots are related to the Zn element. Moreover, in the EDS spectrum, there is a Si peak marked by the \u201ccircle\u201d in the MZO area (point A), The results indicate the interdiffusions which occur across the interface (point B): Zn diffuses from the MZO layer into SiO2 while Si diffuses from the SiO2 layer into the MZO layer. In contrast, for m-MZO HVTFT, as shown in the dashed box of FIG. 3d, the Zn peak appears in the MZO area (point D), only a tiny peak appears near the interface (point E), but no Zn peak is observed inside the SiO2 layer (point F). On the other hand, as shown in the circle, there is no Si peak detected in the MZO area (point D). Therefore, the modulation-doped thin transition layer inserted between the MZO and SiO2 acts as a diffusion barrier, which hinders Zn and Si diffusion across the interface between the channel and gate dielectric layer.",
                                "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to estimate the atomic percentages of different elements in the interface regions. The depth profiles were obtained by using the in-situ sputtering process. FIGS. 3e and f show depth profiles of atomic percentages of Si, Zn, and Mg of the MZO and the m-MZO HVTFT, respectively. A small amount (3%) of Mg doping is barely shown inside the MZO channels in both of MZO and m-MZO HVTFT samples due to the detection limit of XPS. However, a narrow peak of Mg does appear in the m-MZO HVTFT, produced from the MgyZn1-yO transition layer (MZO-TL). In the MZO sample, Zn diffuses extensively into the SiO2 layer as indicated by the length of overlapped XPS profiles of SiO2 and MZO. In contrast, there is an abrupt interface with negligible overlapped profiles of Si and Zn in the m-MZO sample. TEM/EDS and XPS characterizations provide consistent results that the phenomenal interdiffusion between the SiO2 gate dielectric layer and the MZO channel layer is only detected in the MZO HVTFT. The MZO-TL in m-MZO HVTFT acts as a diffusion barrier, which effectively blocks the interdiffusion of Zn from the MZO to SiO2, as well as Si from SiO2 to the MZO channel."

In contrast, the drain leakage current of m-MZO HVTFT keeps as low as 10\u221212 A even at much higher VDS=200 V (here 200 V is the limitation of HP-4156C used for testing). A comparison of the transfer characteristics among three m-MZO HVTFTs with different channel lengths is presented in FIG. 4b. There is a trade-off between blocking capability and driving capability in m-MZO HVTFT. As the channel length increases, the blocking voltage increases; however, the on current drops. The values of the blocking voltage/on-current for the nominal (L=10 min), longer (L=15 min), and longest (L=25 \u03bcm) m-MZO HVTFT are 300 V/3.5\u00d710\u22125 A, 427 V/6.61\u00d710\u22126 A, and 609 V/4.57\u00d710\u22126 A, respectively. The output characteristics of m-MZO HVTFT of 10 \u03bcm are presented in FIG. 4c. It shows better saturation behavior at low gate bias. At high gate bias, the drain current increases as the drain bias increases. This kink effect was also observed in the IGZO HVTFT. It could be related to the channel length modulation induced self-heating effect. The m-MZO HVTFTs with channel length of 10, 15, and 25 \u03bcm have the highest operating drain bias of 70, 110, and 200 V as shown in FIGS. 4d, e and f, respectively. The maximum drain voltage without degrading the on-current defines the highest operating drain bias of each HVTFT, except for the case of 25 \u03bcm which only shows 200 V due to the limitation of the testing equipment. At these high drain bias conditions, all m-MZO HVTFTs show a high on/off ratio (more than), and the VOFF and off-current almost constant at any drain bias condition. The m-MZO HVTFT of 25 \u03bcm can operate at drain bias of 200V with a blocking capability over 600 V, suitable to be used as an inverter of PV-SOG. Interface Engineering",
                                "The interface engineering using a modulation-doped thin MZO transition layer (MZO-TL) in the m-MZO HVTFT improves transfer characteristics of the device, thus enables high voltage blocking capability. Such improvements are mainly attributed to the prevention of Zn diffusion into the SiO2 dielectric layer. Zn could diffuse as ions, such as Zn2+ into the dielectric layer and then become the fixed charges in SiO2. Because the positive Zn2+ trapped inside SiO2 would attract electrons, it requires an extra negative gate bias voltage to deplete the channel. As a result, MZO HVTFT, which has extra diffusion of Zn2+ into SiO2, has more negative Vow than m-MZO HVTFT does. Moreover, the out-diffusion of Zn from the MZO channel layer would generate Zn-related defects, such as Zn vacancies and Zn interstitials in the MZO channel layer, especially near the MZO/SiO2 interface, thus degrading the electrical performance of transistors. The total trap density from the subthreshold slope (S.S.) can be estimated using the following",

The theoretical values of SiO2=3.9 and MgO=9.9034 are used in estimation). The total trap density includes the bulk trap (tNbulk) and the interface trap (Dit), which are calculated to be 2.14\u00d71012 cm\u22122 and 8.36\u00d71011 cm\u22122 for MZO and m-MZO HVTFT, respectively. Since the channel material is the same, the difference in the total charge density between HVTFT and m-HVTFT is approximately equal to the reduction of the interface trap density, which is 1.3\u00d71012 cm\u22122. By adding a modulation doped transition layer into the m-MZO HVTFT, Zn diffusion into the SiO2 dielectric layer is significantly suppressed. The interface engineering successfully adjusts the threshold voltage Vth close to 0 V and makes the S.S. steeper than that of MZO-HVTFT.",
                                "The addition of the MZO-TL also enables the higher blocking voltage. The ideal break-down field of a pure MgO is 12 MV/cm. Although the effective thickness of the dielectric layer increases by adding the MZO-TL, a 10 nm MZO transition layer can not provide more than 12 V of the blocking voltage. Furthermore, the gate leakage current keeps at a similar level in both HVTFTs after the breakdown at high drain bias. Therefore, the significant enhancement of the blocking voltage in m-MZO HVTFT cannot be attributed to the extra voltage drop on the MZO-TL. In order to understand the fundamental cause of the improvement in blocking voltage, SILVACO software was used to simulate the electric field distributions in the two different devices. As drawn in the FIG. 5a, MZO HVTFT possesses extra positive oxide charges in comparison to m-MZO HVTFT. The amount of the extra equivalent oxide charges per unit area (QOX) is estimated based on following equation:",

The difference in VOFF between MZO and m-MZO HVTFT is around \u22126V, so the extra 6.47\u00d71011 cm\u22122 of positive charges are placed in the MZO HVTFT. The impact of oxide charges near the interface on electrical field distribution in the device is shown in FIG. 5. The maximum values of the electrical field near the interface are 1,520 kV/cm, and 1,410 kV/cm for MZO and m-MZO HVTFT, respectively. The reduction of the maximum electrical field allows m-MZO HVTFT to operate at higher drain bias, enabling higher blocking voltage. Overall, the MZO-TL in m-MZO HVTFT acts as a barrier against Zn diffusion so the interface states and trapped charges are reduced. This improvement leads to the decrease of the maximum electrical field near the channel-gate dielectric interface, resulting in the increase of the blocking voltage."

For comparison, the m-MZO HVTFTs with both configurations that have the equivalent channel length and offset region length are used in the simulation.

On the contrary, the field distribution in the ring structure (FIG. 7c) is uniform from drain to source, and the highest field is 1,420 kV/cm, which is approximately 50% less than in the rectangular counterpart.
