                        "The emergence of infections by carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represent a global threat to human health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) categorize CRE infections as a major and urgent threat to public health. Resistance of CRE to carbapenem antibiotics leaves few treatment options other than colistin and polymyxin B, both of which have limited use because of their toxicities. Among Enterobacteriaceae, infections by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli cause an estimated 140,000 nosocomial infections per year in the United States alone, and an increasing fraction are carbapenem resistant. Of the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, carbapenems have the broadest activity spectrum and greatest potency against Gram negative bacteria. However, the incidence of CRE infections continues to rise in health care settings and in the community4,5, underscoring the need for new therapeutic countermeasures. In this regard, most efforts have focused on developing new carbapenem/\u03b2-lactam-based drugs, some which are combined with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors3. Carbapenem resistance is multifactorial, involving acquisition of new or mutant \u03b2-lactamases, efflux pumps, loss of outer membrane porins, and alterations of penicillin binding proteins6,7, and combinations of these resistance mechanisms broaden resistance to carbapenems and other antibiotics by CRE 5, especially in K. pneumoniae.",
                        "Defensins are a diverse family of small antimicrobial proteins that are part of the body's nonspecific defense against infection. There are three different and structurally distinct classes of defensin proteins: alpha, beta, and theta defensins. The \u03b1 and \u03b2 defensins are linear, tri-disulfide containing peptides having molecular weights of about 2.6 kDa or 4.5 kDa, respectively. In contrast, \u03b8-defensins are cyclic peptides (i.e. circular peptides wherein the backbone is formed by sequential peptide bonds with neither a free amino or carboxyl terminus) composed of 18 amino acids.",
                        "\u03b8-defensins are expressed in tissues of rhesus monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys. They are not present in humans and other hominids. Naturally occurring \u03b8-defensins are composed of 18 backbone cyclized (i.e. through the alpha-amine groups rather than side chain moieties) peptides stabilized by three disulfide bonds. These three disulfide bonds are conserved among all known \u03b8-defensins. \u03b8-defensins were originally discovered and classified as defensins based on the antimicrobial properties of the peptides. More recently it has been found that \u03b8-defensins can have potent immunomodulatory effects.",

These analogs, however, retain the length and structure of the native retrocyclin. In addition, the reference is only instructive for antibacterial activity.",
                        "Peptide analogs of various defensins have been investigated. For example, European Patent Application EP2990415 (to Colavita et al) describes circularized analogs of a \u03b2-defensin that show improved antibiotic effectiveness relative to the parent protein. Such \u03b2-defensins, however, have been shown to stimulate release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which raises safety concerns and limits their utility.",

                        "Inventors have described synthetic cyclic tetradecapeptide analogs of the theta defensin RTD-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) that showed some of the activities of the parent peptide, despite their smaller size and reduced number of disulfide bonds. The structures of natural theta defensin RTD-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and some exemplary synthetic cyclic tetradecapeptide analogs are shown in FIG. 1. As shown, RTD-1 (which is expressed naturally in rhesus monkeys) is a cyclic octadecapeptide that includes 3 pairs of cysteines coupled by disulfide bonds that transit the circular primary structure of the peptide. A number of examples of synthetic (i.e., non-naturally occurring) analogs of RTD-1 are shown. Each of the exemplary synthetic analogs is a tetradecapeptide that includes 2 pairs of cysteines coupled by disulfide bonds. These disulfide bonds transit the circular primary structure of the synthetic peptides to form a \u201cbox\u201d substructure that incorporates additional amino acids. It should be appreciated that these exemplary analogs show varying degrees of sequence identity with RTD-1, and in some instances show conservative amino acid substitutions near and between the \u201cbox\u201d defined by cysteines of the synthetic peptide analogs.",
                        "Inventors have developed a novel therapeutic strategy employing a small peptide, for example in the form of a macrocyclic peptide, that is highly effective in a mouse model of CRE bacteremic sepsis. Peptide 2 is an example of such a peptide, and acts by promoting a plurality of host-mediated mechanisms, including (but not limited to) clearance of the pathogen by stimulating phagocytosis, while also homeostatically modulating dysregulated systemic inflammation. It should be appreciated that the effects of such host mechanisms are not limited to bacterial infection (as provided in examples below), but are also effective against fungal, viral, and protozoan infection. Accordingly, Inventors contemplate effects against a range of microbes that includes bacteria, fungi, viruses, and/or protozoans.",
                        "Peptide 2 is a 14-amino acid macrocyclic peptide containing two disulfide bonds (FIG. 1) that possesses features of naturally occurring macrocyclic \u03b8-defensins expressed uniquely in myeloid and epithelial cells of Old World monkeys (OWM, e.g., rhesus macaques, baboons, vervets, cynomolgus monkeys)8,9 but not in other primates or non-primates. All known natural \u03b8-defensins are 18-amino acid cyclic peptides containing three disulfides which confer remarkable stability in vitro and in vivo11-14. Studies show that \u03b8-defensins possess potent antimicrobial activities in vitro and unique anti-infective and immunoregulatory properties in vivo. The prototype rhesus macaque \u03b8-defensin RTD-1 (FIG. 1) is effective in preclinical models of severe sepsis and associated shock. It has been hypothesized that \u03b8-defensins contribute to the unique host defense and immunomodulatory responses of ole world monkeys, primates that, compared to humans and other hominins, are intrinsically resistant to bacterial infections, endotoxemia, and sepsis. In sepsis models, \u03b8-defensins facilitate host-mediated clearance of bacterial and fungal pathogens while moderating cytokine-driven immunopathology.",
                        "On investigation, Peptide 2 emerged as a promising lead for further preclinical evaluation as a therapeutic for multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections. Peptide 2 was found to be efficacious in treatment of CRE sepsis in BALB/c mice and acts by stimulating host-mediated clearance of CRE pathogens through enhancement of a plurality of host defense responses, including phagocytosis and immune cell recruitment, while concomitantly modulating pathogenic cytokine responses (as shown below).",
                        "Peptide 2 is a bioinspired macrocyclic peptide that is structurally related to naturally occurring \u03b8-defensins. Among a series of minimized \u03b8-defensins, Peptide 2 was identified as a promising candidate based on its low toxicity in vitro and in vivo, stability in biological matrices, and suppression of TNF release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages. As shown herein, Peptide 2 is highly effective in promoting long term survival, bacterial clearance, and moderation of dysregulated systemic inflammation in CRE septicemia.",
                        "Both therapeutic and prophylactic single dose administration of Peptide 2 significantly enhanced long term survival following challenge with Kp-1705, an organism that is resistant to carbapenems both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Peptide 2 was as effective in vivo as colistin and polymyxin B, drugs of last resort that have limited utility as human therapeutics owing to their toxicities. RTD-1 was also effective in Kp-1705 sepsis, but at approximately 10-fold higher concentrations than the effective dose of Peptide 2. In addition, Peptide 2 promoted long term survival in mice challenged with a CRE strain of E. coli (BAA-2340) demonstrating efficacy against the two most common species of CRE pathogens.",
                        "Highly efficacious single dose treatment of both CRE pathogens was obtained with administration of Peptide 2 at 1.25 mg/kg, a dose level that resulted in plasma Cmax of 0.25 \u03bcg/ml which is >400 times lower than the MIC of Peptide 2 against both organisms in the presence of serum (>100 \u03bcg/ml). Moreover, Peptide 2-containing peritoneal fluid had no bactericidal activity against Kp-1705. This demonstrates that the antimicrobial effect of Peptide 2 is not direct, but rather is mediated by stimulation of host clearance mechanisms, similar to the therapeutic effect of RTD-1 in systemic candidiasis 15.",
                        "In the bacteremia model employed, Kp-1705 was widely disseminated in blood and solid organs at the time of Peptide 2 treatment. This, and the lack of Peptide 2 activity in peritoneal fluid, enabled infection and delayed peptide administration by the same route. Peptide 2 treatment induced marked reductions in bacterial burden in blood, peritoneal lavage, and spleen within 4 hours of treatment, and this was accompanied by a marked peptide-induced neutrophilic infiltrate in the peritoneal cavity. Microscopic analysis of PLF from Peptide 2 treated infected mice revealed markedly increased phagocytosis of bacteria compared to control. Blood neutrophil levels were also transiently elevated in infected mice treated with Peptide 2 as well as in mock-infected controls, suggesting that the peptide stimulates a systemic neutrophilic response. Of note, i.p. administration of Peptide 2 induced transient rises in CXCL1, IL-5, and IL-6 in sham treated mice. CXCL1 is a potent neutrophil chemokine which in concert with its receptor CXCR2, plays a key role as one of two cytokine/receptor axes controlling the migration of neutrophils from the bone marrow 29. Thus, CXCL1 may mediate Peptide 2-induced transient neutrophilia.",
                        "Peptide 2-mediated phagocytosis, revealed by cytologic examination of PLF in infected mice, was recapitulated in vitro by co-incubation of Kp-1705 with RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of the peptide, resulting in up to 12-fold increases in phagocytic index. Consistent with this, preincubation of Kp-1705 with a sub-MIC concentration of Peptide 2 promoted phagocytosis in vivo and markedly enhanced mouse survival (FIG. 4c), evidence that Peptide 2 has opsonin-like properties. Mice were also protected from Kp-1705 septicemia by a single dose of Peptide 2 administered 1 or 3 hours prior to infection, indicating that systemic levels of the peptide are also effective prophylactically. The degree to which this effect is mediated by induction of phagocytosis in extraperitoneal tissues remains to be determined.",
                        "Pathogenesis of septicemia results from an imbalance of the host damage-response framework. Challenge with K. pneumoniae initiates host innate immune responses which progress through systemic inflammatory response syndrome, evolving to severe sepsis, and finally in lethal septic shock. This detrimental host response is largely driven by dysregulated cytokine signaling which results in uncontrolled inflammation, host-mediated tissue destruction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple organ failure. Modulation of cytokine responses in Peptide 2 treated mice was associated with suppression of otherwise immunopathologic cytokine release without inducing an immunocompromised state. Moreover, Peptide 2 treatment significantly enhanced the recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity, an innate immune response which is often accompanied by inflammatory tissue damage. However, Peptide 2-induced neutrophil recruitment was accompanied by increased phagocytosis, bacterial clearance, and homeostatic resolution of plasma cytokines.",
                        "Although mouse models of bacteremic sepsis are distinct from human sepsis syndromes, they are a common starting point for identification of infectious disease drug candidates. To address the potential of Peptide 2 as a human therapeutic, the immunomodulatory activity of the peptide on TNF and IL-6 expression by bacteria-stimulated human blood leukocytes was analyzed. The peptide suppressed release of both cytokines in a concentration dependent manner. Other experiments showed that Peptide 2 is remarkably stable in plasma and when incubated for 24 hours with live CRE isolates, suggesting that this macrocyclic peptide is an attractive candidate for further preclinical development. Additional studies showed that i.p. administration of Peptide 2 is well tolerated in BALB/c mice at doses more than 100-fold higher than the 0.5 mg/kg efficacious dose (data not shown).",
                        "It has been found that \u03b8-defensin-inspired macrocyclic small peptides such as Peptide 2 are remarkably effective for treatment of Gram negative bacterial infections. Like RTD-1, the mechanism of action of Peptide 2 is host directed, and therefore, less likely to select for drug resistance than conventional antibiotics. Moreover, the stability and pharmacologic properties of Peptide 2 suggests that it represents a promising new class of immunomodulating anti-infectives much needed to address the worldwide crisis resulting from antimicrobial resistance.",

These analogs were extrapolated from the \u03b8-defensin analog designated Peptide 2 (see FIG. 1, SEQ ID NO: 3), a synthetic peptide that provides substantially improved effects (relative to RTD-1) in long term survival of mice in a model of sepsis, and that provides these effects at surprisingly low concentrations. It should be appreciated that long term survival of sepsis requires both management of the infecting organism and of the shock induced by the host response to the infection, either of which can lead to death.",
                        "Surprisingly, \u03b8-defensin analogs were identified that can also provide a biphasic response in modulating the immune system. The initial effect is opsonic, recruiting effector cells to the sepsis site. This serves to combat infection, and surprisingly was found to occur at concentrations of the \u03b8-defensin analog that demonstrated neither a bactericidal nor a bacteriostatic effect (i.e., subantimicrobial concentrations). Following this initial opsonic effect these synthetic \u03b8-defensin analogs exhibit a longer term immunomodulatory effect (for example, reducing TNF, IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines) that contributes to long term survival in preventing septic shock.",

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Peptide 2 and RTD-1 against a panel of CRE bacteria were determined and compared with carbapenem antibiotics (meropenem and imipenem), colistin, and polymyxin B. Test organisms included K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains expressing carbapenemases (KPC-2, NDM-1), extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) resistance factors as well as antibiotic sensitive reference strains (see Methods). Under standard CLSI assay conditions, the MIC of Peptide 2 was 3.13-6.25 \u03bcg/ml against CRE and non-CRE strains of K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Peptide 2 was superior to RTD-1, and was as or more effective than meropenem and imipenem against each of the strains tested. As expected, colistin and polymyxin B were effective at low concentrations (<0.78 \u03bcg/ml) against all seven organisms.

                                "The phagocytosis-inducing activity of Peptide 2 was further analyzed by incubating live Kp-1705 cells with 1.25 \u03bcg/ml of Peptide 2 (\u2155 the MIC under optimal conditions; Table 3) and challenging mice with Peptide 2 pre-treated bacteria. Although pre-treatment had no effect on bacterial viability or replication fitness of the organism (FIGS. 10A and 10B), mice challenged with the bacteria-peptide mixture were protected (FIG. 9C). Because no statistically significant protection was afforded by i.p. administration of an equal quantity of peptide (0.5 ml of 1.25 \u03bcg/ml) immediately following infection, it was inferred that preincubation of bacteria with Peptide 2 renders them susceptible to host clearance. Also, pre-incubation with Peptide 2 markedly increased bacterial killing and phagocytosis in the peritoneal cavity (FIGS. 9D to 9F), consistent with the effect of peptide treatment on phagocytosis and bacterial killing of Kp-1705 infected mice (FIGS. 8A and 8B).",

Multiplex analysis of 32 mouse cytokines was performed on plasma samples collected 2, 4, and 24 hours p.i. from Kp-1705 septicemic mice treated with Peptide 2 or saline (FIG. 11 and Table 4). Kp-1705 infection induced a rapid and profound elevation of 26 cytokines, some of which increased >1,000 fold within 2-4 hours p.i. (Table 4). Plasma levels of six cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-7 and VEGF) were not significantly altered by Kp-1705 infection nor were they affected by Peptide 2 treatment.",

The earliest (2 hours) effects seen were statistically significant reductions of CCL4 and CXCL2 (Table 4). By 4 hours p.i., 7 additional cytokines were significantly reduced, including TNF, IL-6, and CXCL1 (KC) which have major roles in sepsis pathogenesis (FIG. 11). Peptide 2 treatment also resulted in significant increases of IL-9 and IL-15 levels at 4 hours p.i. (Table 4).",

With the exception of IL-15 (P=0.052), reductions of cytokine levels were significant compared to saline treated controls (Table 4), and levels of 23 cytokines were reduced by >80%, most notably TNF, (\u221289.8%; P=3.52\u00d710\u2212s), IL-6 (\u221299.7%; P=4.38\u00d710\u22126), CXCL1 (KC) (\u221298.8%; P=1.25\u00d710\u22125), and IL-17 (\u2212100.0%; P=1.06\u00d710\u22127) (FIG. 11).

At the 4 hour collection point, only three of the 32 mouse cytokines changed significantly relative to sham/saline controls: IL-5, IL-6, and CXCL1 were significantly elevated compared to vehicle treated controls (FIG. 12).

RTD-1 suppressed the release of soluble TNF from LPS stimulated macrophages dose dependently (FIG. 13A). Peptide 2 also inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF release, but 50% TNF suppression was obtained at ca. 4-fold lower concentration than RTD-1.",

As shown in FIG. 13B, Peptide 2 concentration-dependently suppressed the release of TNF and IL-6. Peptide alone had no effect on TNF or IL-6 release (data not shown).

To assess peptide stability further, Peptide 2 was incubated in human EDTA-plasma (90% vol/vol) at 37\u00b0 C. for 48 hours. Reversed-phase UPLC analyses showed that >95% of the peptide remained intact.

Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour, serially diluted, and plated on TSB to determine bacterial viability. Statistical Analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism\u00ae Version 8.2.1. End-point survival data were compared using Fisher's exact test. P values of \u22640.05 were defined as significant. Statistics analyzing bacterial burdens and cytokine responses first confirmed lognormal distribution by Anderson-Darling test. Values were then log-transformed and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with an Uncorrected Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) post-test. Student's t-tests were performed using a two-tail analysis.",
