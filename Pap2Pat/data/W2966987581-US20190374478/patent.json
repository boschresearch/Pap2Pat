    "abstract": "Herein presented are gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) used for the transport of medications to mucous membranes. The AuNPs are ultra-stable in that they withstand freeze-drying and heating treatments without noticeable change in their structure. In addition, they interact with mucous membranes, and therefore allow transport of certain drugs to these mucous membranes, allowing higher exposure time of the drugs, hence decreased dosing schedule of administration.",

                        "Gold aggregate is one of the most studied particles due to its unique properties that allow its use in diverse areas. Gold nano-aggregates can be divided into three groups: nanoclusters (less than 2 nm in diameter), nanoparticles (NPs) (2-100 nm in diameter) and nanocrystals (more than 100 nm) (see, for example, Lu, Y. et al., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2013. 117-153; Mingos, D. M. P., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 1-47; Dreaden, E. C. et al., Chemical Society Reviews 41.7 (2012): 2740-2779; Boisselier, E. et al., Chemical society reviews 38.6 (2009): 1759-1782; Fran\u00a3ois, A. et al., ChemMedChem 6.11 (2011): 2003-2008; Muddineti, O. S. et al., International journal of pharmaceutics 484.1 (2015): 252-267; and Niikura, K. et al., ACS applied materials & interfaces 5.9 (2013): 3900-3907, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes).",
                        "The metallic surface can be functionalized with different chemical groups such as thiol groups leading to a very efficient stabilization of the gold core. However, in this context, there are still a number of challenges related to the stability of AuNPs in different conditions, as different buffers, times and temperatures. Indeed, for future medical applications, AuNPs must be ultrastable to remain biocompatible and not lead to aggregation or toxicity.",
                        "For example, Gupta, A. et al synthesized AuNPs functionalized with ethylene glycol and a zwitterionic group (see Gupta, A. et al ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 8.22 (2016): 14096-14101, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). These NPs were stable to pH changes, salt concentrations, heating and freeze-drying. As another example, Tatumi and Fujihara synthesized AuNPs functionalized with a zwitterionic liquid which were stable in solutions that contain high concentrations of salts and proteins (see Tatumi, R. et al., Chemical Communications 1 (2005): 83-85, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). However, the use of these AuNPs might be complicated in vivo due to their potential toxicity arising from their zwitterionic groups leading to the presence of charged groups in periphery (see Fr\u00f6hlich, E. International journal of nanomedicine 7 (2012): 5577-5591, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). Zhou et al synthesized AuNPs with a one-step process in water by adding a reducing agent to a mixture of gold and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (see Zhou, M. et al., Nanotechnology 20.50 (2009): 505606, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The stabilizing groups were carboxyl groups, where a transfer of the oxygen electron to the gold helped to stabilize the NPs in water media with high concentrations of salts. However, the use of thiols groups on the gold core leads to a better stability and should thus be used for in vivo applications (see Dreaden, E. C. et al., Chemical Society Reviews 41.7 (2012): 2740-2779; Kumara, C. et al., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 155-187; and Brust, M. et al., Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications 7 (1994): 801-802, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes).",
                        "Several synthesis methods lead to spherical AuNPs. Brust and Turkevish methods are among the most used (see Brust, M. et al. Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications 7 (1994): 801-802; Turkevich, J. et al., Journal of colloid Science 9 (1954): 26-35; Yang, X. et al., Chemical reviews 115.19 (2015): 10410-10488, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes). The Brust method is a single step synthesis and generally leads to smaller and more stable NPs than the citrate ones. However, the Brust method involves the use of toxic reagents as toluene and tetraoctylammonium bromide (see Mingos, D. M. P., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 1-47; Dreaden, E. C. et al., Chemical Society Reviews 41.7 (2012): 2740-2779; and Brust, M. et al. Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications 7 (1994): 801-802, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes). Although synthesis of AuNPs could be achieved directly in water, this method was found to form few stable NPs and only worked with ligands that could quickly stabilize the gold core (low molecular weight ligands).",

After these treatments, the AuNPs were still soluble and stable in water. These results were repeated with other types of thiolated polyethylene glycol groups (PEG 800-SH or PEG-6000) and with three repeated cycles of either freeze-drying or heating cycles.

A method for synthesizing gold nanoparticles, said method comprising the steps of:\na) providing chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) dissolved in a mix acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol to form a gold solution;\nb) providing PEG-SH ligand dissolved in isopropyl alcohol;\nc) adding said dissolved PEG-SH ligand to said gold solution to form a first mixture;\nd) agitating said first mixture;\ne) adding dropwise NaBH4 dissolved in water to the first mixture under intense agitation to form a second mixture;\nf) leaving said second mixture for sufficient time to stabilize;\ng) evaporating said acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol from said second mixture to obtain an aqueous solution of gold nanoparticles; and\nh) submitting said aqueous gold nanoparticles solution to dialysis to remove excess PEG-SH ligand.",

        "51. The method of claim 42, comprising the steps of:\na\u2032) dissolving chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) in an acetonitrile-containing solvent to form a partially-reduced gold solution;\nb\u2032) dissolving biocompatible ligand-SH in an organic solvent;\nc\u2032) adding said dissolved biocompatible ligand-SH to said partially-reduced gold solution to form a partially-reduced mixture;\nd\u2032) reducing the partially-reduced mixture to form a reduced mixture; and\ne\u2032) leaving said reduced mixture for sufficient time to proceed to nucleation and crystallization."
