# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to ultrastable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) used for the transport of medication to mucous membranes. The interaction between the mucous membrane and the AuNPs allows greater exposure time of the drug, hence allowing decreased dosing schedule of administration. The present invention also relates to a method of synthesis of such AuNPs.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Gold aggregate is one of the most studied particles due to its unique properties that allow its use in diverse areas. Gold nano-aggregates can be divided into three groups: nanoclusters (less than 2 nm in diameter), nanoparticles (NPs) (2-100 nm in diameter) and nanocrystals (more than 100 nm) (see, for example, Lu, Y. et al., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2013. 117-153; Mingos, D. M. P., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 1-47; Dreaden, E. C. et al., Chemical Society Reviews 41.7 (2012): 2740-2779; Boisselier, E. et al., Chemical society reviews 38.6 (2009): 1759-1782; Fran£ois, A. et al., ChemMedChem 6.11 (2011): 2003-2008; Muddineti, O. S. et al., International journal of pharmaceutics 484.1 (2015): 252-267; and Niikura, K. et al., ACS applied materials & interfaces 5.9 (2013): 3900-3907, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes).

The metallic surface can be functionalized with different chemical groups such as thiol groups leading to a very efficient stabilization of the gold core. However, in this context, there are still a number of challenges related to the stability of AuNPs in different conditions, as different buffers, times and temperatures. Indeed, for future medical applications, AuNPs must be ultrastable to remain biocompatible and not lead to aggregation or toxicity.

For example, Gupta, A. et al synthesized AuNPs functionalized with ethylene glycol and a zwitterionic group (see Gupta, A. et al ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 8.22 (2016): 14096-14101, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). These NPs were stable to pH changes, salt concentrations, heating and freeze-drying. As another example, Tatumi and Fujihara synthesized AuNPs functionalized with a zwitterionic liquid which were stable in solutions that contain high concentrations of salts and proteins (see Tatumi, R. et al., Chemical Communications 1 (2005): 83-85, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). However, the use of these AuNPs might be complicated in vivo due to their potential toxicity arising from their zwitterionic groups leading to the presence of charged groups in periphery (see Fröhlich, E. International journal of nanomedicine 7 (2012): 5577-5591, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). Zhou et al synthesized AuNPs with a one-step process in water by adding a reducing agent to a mixture of gold and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (see Zhou, M. et al., Nanotechnology 20.50 (2009): 505606, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The stabilizing groups were carboxyl groups, where a transfer of the oxygen electron to the gold helped to stabilize the NPs in water media with high concentrations of salts. However, the use of thiols groups on the gold core leads to a better stability and should thus be used for in vivo applications (see Dreaden, E. C. et al., Chemical Society Reviews 41.7 (2012): 2740-2779; Kumara, C. et al., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 155-187; and Brust, M. et al., Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications 7 (1994): 801-802, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes).

Several synthesis methods lead to spherical AuNPs. Brust and Turkevish methods are among the most used (see Brust, M. et al. Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications 7 (1994): 801-802; Turkevich, J. et al., Journal of colloid Science 9 (1954): 26-35; Yang, X. et al., Chemical reviews 115.19 (2015): 10410-10488, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes). The Brust method is a single step synthesis and generally leads to smaller and more stable NPs than the citrate ones. However, the Brust method involves the use of toxic reagents as toluene and tetraoctylammonium bromide (see Mingos, D. M. P., Gold Clusters, Colloids and Nanoparticles I. Springer International Publishing, 2014. 1-47; Dreaden, E. C. et al., Chemical Society Reviews 41.7 (2012): 2740-2779; and Brust, M. et al. Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications 7 (1994): 801-802, all incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes). Although synthesis of AuNPs could be achieved directly in water, this method was found to form few stable NPs and only worked with ligands that could quickly stabilize the gold core (low molecular weight ligands).

The present invention thus proposes new synthesis conditions leading to ultrastable biocompatible AuNPs.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

**Methods**

**Chemical Synthesis**

First, 0.0635 mmol of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was dissolved in 15 mL of a mix acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (50/50) (FIG. 1). Then, PEG 2000-SH (0.026 g, 0.013 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of isopropyl alcohol, and was then added to the gold solution. The molar ratio of gold to PEG used was 4.9:1. The mixture was then left under agitation for one hour. 0.028 g of NaBH4 in 10 mL of ice cold water was then added to the mixture dropwise at a rate of 1.3 mL/min with intense agitation (1200 rpm). After complete addition of the NaBH4 the mixture was left to stabilize for three more hours. The solvent was then evaporated with a rotary evaporator until a volume of 5 mL was obtained. The AuNPs solution was then loaded in a dialysis tube for two days with several washings in order to remove the excess ligands. The AuNPs were then stored in an amber colored glass vial.

The same chemical synthesis was used replacing PEG 2000-SH by PEG-800-SH or PEG-6000-SH.

**Physicochemical Characterizations**

The weight of AuNPs was determined with a microbalance. Their absorbance was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy. The stability of NPs was also assessed after freeze-drying (samples frozen at −80° C. for 15 min then freeze-dried for 3 hours), and overnight (16 hours) heating at 65° C. by comparing their UV spectra before and after these treatments. The diameter of the gold core was determined using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). This diameter was then used to calculate the number of gold atoms using the equations below.

\(\begin{matrix}
{{{Volume}\mspace{14mu} {of}\mspace{14mu} \text{?}\text{?}} - \frac{\text{?}\pi \text{?}\left( {{radius}\mspace{14mu} {in}\text{?}} \right)^{3}}{3}} & \left( {{equation}\mspace{14mu} 1} \right) \\
{{{{{Number}\mspace{14mu} \text{?}\; \text{?}\; \text{?}\mspace{14mu} {the}\mspace{14mu} {goal}\mspace{14mu} {core}} - \frac{{volume}\mspace{14mu} {of}\mspace{14mu} {the}\mspace{14mu} {core}\mspace{14mu} {in}\text{?}}{17\text{?}}}{\text{?}\text{indicates text missing or illegible when filed}}}\mspace{214mu}} & \left( {{equation}\mspace{14mu} 2} \right)
\end{matrix}\)

Mucoadhesion measurements were performed by UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for the inner filter effect, taking both excitation and emission into account. (see Coutinho, A. et al., J. Chem. Educ 70.5 (1993): 425; and Komarnicka, U. et al., Dalton Transactions 45.12 (2016): 5052-5063, both incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes). First, the excitation light used to illuminate the fluorophore, f, can also be absorbed by another component, i, present in the sample. Given that the total absorbance (Abst) is given by Abst=Absi+Absf, the correction factor (C1) at the excitation wavelength is given by the following equation:

\(\begin{matrix}
{{{{C\; 1} - {\frac{\text{?}}{\text{?}}\left( \frac{1 - {10\text{?}}}{1 - {10^{-}\text{?}}} \right)}}{\text{?}\text{indicates text missing or illegible when filed}}}\mspace{185mu}} & \left( {{equation}\mspace{14mu} 3} \right)
\end{matrix}\)

Also, fluorescence emission may be re-absorbed by another component, e, present in the sample. In this case, the correction factor (C2) at the emission wavelength is given by the following equation:

\(\begin{matrix}
{{{{C\; 2} = \frac{2.303\text{?}}{1 - {10^{-}\text{?}}}}{\text{?}\text{indicates text missing or illegible when filed}}}\mspace{185mu}} & \left( {{equation}\mspace{14mu} 4} \right)
\end{matrix}\)

**Results**

The initial mixing of HAuCl4 and PEG 2000-SH resulted in a partial reduction of gold. The complete reduction was then achieved with the addition of NaBH4 which initiated the crystal formation. The gold atoms were then capped and stabilized with the thiolated ligands. The speed of crystal growth versus ligand capping determined the success of this synthesis. The presence of acetonitrile in the initial reaction slowed the growth of crystals and allowed better capping and stabilization.

These new experimental conditions led to ultrastable NPs with an absorption spectrum of AuNPs around 515 nm (FIG. 2). This spectrum did not evolve after one cycle of freeze-drying (FIG. 3, orange spectrum). After heating, the spectrum slightly evolved but no aggregation or precipitation was observed (FIG. 3, grey spectrum). Indeed, the heating could have slightly modified the arrangement of the ligands onto the gold core which could have influenced the NPs absorption. After these treatments, the AuNPs were still soluble and stable in water. These results were repeated with other types of thiolated polyethylene glycol groups (PEG 800-SH or PEG-6000) and with three repeated cycles of either freeze-drying or heating cycles. FIG. 4 displays the UV-visible spectra of AuNPs capped with (A) PEG 800-SH, (B) PEG 2000-SH and (C) PEG 6000-SH after three repetitive cycles of heating overnight (16 hours) at 65° C. Again, we can see that the spectrum did not significantly evolve (FIGS. 4 (A), (B) and (C), purple spectra). FIG. 5 displays UV-visible spectra of AuNPs capped with (A) PEG 800-SH, (B) PEG 2000-SH and (C) PEG 6000-SH after three cycles of freeze-drying or (lyophilization). Again, the spectrum did not significantly evolve (FIGS. 5 (A), (B) and (C), purple spectra) after the three cycles.

TEM images revealed spherical particles with a mean diameter of 2.1±0.7 nm (FIG. 6) for the AuNPs PEG 2000-SH, and respectively of 1.88±0.69 nm and 2.37±1.03 nm for the AuNPs PEG 800-SH and PEG 6000-SH. Moreover, according to the equations described in the methods section, the average number of gold atoms in the core was found to be 309. Elemental analysis (fire assay and induction assay) were performed by SRC Geoanalytical Laboratories (Saskatchewan). The resulting molecular weight of the AuNPs capped with PEG 2000-SH was found to be 4 326 893.88 g/mol.

The Zeta potential analysis technique was performed to determine the surface charge of the AuNPs. The Zeta potential is one of the fundamental parameters known to affect stability. The Zeta potential obtained for the AuNPs PEG 800-SH, PEG 2000-SH, and PEG 6000-SH were respectively (−7.05±7.46 mV), (−8.02±4.28 mV) and (−1.79±4.28 mV).

The Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique was used to calculate the hydrodynamic diameter of the AuNPs. The hydrodynamic diameter potential obtained for the AuNPs PEG 800-SH, PEG 2000-SH, and PEG 6000-SH were respectively (33±1 nm), (31±4 nm) and (54±2 nm).

Mucoadhesion measurements were performed with UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. The slight increase of the absorbance intensity of the AuNPs observed by UV spectroscopy illustrated the perturbation of the metallic core by the mucins, and thus their interaction (FIG. 7).

The mucoadhesion between the AuNPs and the mucins could also be illustrated by the quenching of fluorescence of mucins (FIG. 8). Indeed, after the two correction factors application as explained in the above section entitled “Physicochemical characterizations”, the decrease in fluorescence intensity of mucins in the presence of AuNPs was due to their interaction, and thus to the mucoadhesive properties of the AuNPs.

**Conclusions and Perspectives**

For medical applications, AuNPs must be ultrastable to increase their efficiency and decrease their toxicity. The new experimental conditions presented herein led to ultrastable AuNPs, even after freeze-drying and heating. These new ultrastable AuNPs have a promising future in the drug delivery area.

### Example 2

**Encapsulation Protocol**

**Conditions of Encapsulation**

The AuNPs and the drug are brought into contact in a screw-cap 2 mL microtube, with magnetic bar stirring, at 37° C. for a time determined according to the kinetics of encapsulation obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy.

**Encapsulation of Travoprost**

In the case of travoprost, an encapsulation time of five days was chosen according to the encapsulation kinetics determined by UV spectroscopy at 278 nm (FIG. 9).

**Encapsulation of Timolol**

In the case of timolol, an encapsulation time of 30 minutes was chosen according to the encapsulation kinetics determined by UV spectroscopy at 295 nm (FIG. 10).

**Protocol to Determine the Encapsulation Efficiency**

The method used to determine the encapsulation efficiency rely on an indirect assay by evaluating what has not been encapsulated. Once the encapsulation is complete, the entire mixture is brought into contact with magnetic beads to allow the nanoparticles that contain the encapsulated drug to be removed from the medium. The residual supernatant is then analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

To do so, a solution of 0.0005% phosphate buffered saline Tween™ (PBS-T) was prepared. The magnetic beads were then cleaned and 100 μL of magnetic beads were placed in a 1.5 mL microtube. The beads were then magnetized, and the supernatant was removed.

1 mL of the prepared PBS-T was added to the beads, the beads were then suspended with a vigorous vortex for 30 seconds. The beads were then magnetized, and the supernatant was removed. These steps were repeated consecutively three times. 4 μg of antibody were then added in a final volume of 200 μl and the beads were suspended again. The suspension was stirred for 10 minutes using the thermomixer (1000 rpm, at a temperature of 21° C.). The beads were then once again magnetized, and the supernatant was removed.

Another 1 mL of the prepared PBS-T was added to the beads. The beads were then again suspended with a vigorous vortex for 30 seconds. The beads were then once again magnetized, and the supernatant was removed. These steps were also repeated successively three times.

0.5 mL of the sample for which you want to assay the encapsulation was then added. The solution was stirred for 3 hours using the thermomixer (1000 rpm, at a temperature of 21° C.). The beads were then once again magnetized, and the supernatant was recovered.

The recovered supernatant was then put back in the microtube, the beads were then re-magnetized, and the supernatant was recovered. These steps were performed twice.

The final supernatant was analyzed by UV-Visible spectroscopy (λ=200-700 nm) and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

FIG. 11 illustrates that three magnetizations were required to remove 98% of the nanoparticles. The residual absorbance was then comparable to the limit of the error of the apparatus. Calibration curves of travoprost by UV-visible spectroscopy (FIG. 12) and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (FIG. 13) in PBS-T (0.0005% tween) were performed. The calibration curve of timolol by UV-visible spectroscopy in PBS-T (0.0005% tween) was also performed (FIG. 14).

FIG. 15 illustrates the percentage of encapsulated travoprost, this experiment was performed with an initial concentration of travoprost in the sample of 80 μM and 120 μM and a concentration of AuNPs of 69 nM. The obtained percentages were about 68.52%±4.032% of encapsulated travoprost for an initial 80 μM and about 67.98%±3.877% of encapsulated travoprost for an initial 120 μM.

### Example 3

In Vivo Results Obtained with the Ultrastable AuNPs

**Material and Methods**

An in vivo glaucoma model involving the injection of exogenous microbeads into the anterior chamber was used (FIG. 17A). The injected beads partially block the trabecular meshwork resulting in intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation while causing no damage to the site of drug action. Two-month-old C57BL/6J mice were used. The IOP was followed with a tonometer (Tonolab®) specially designed for rodents. Animals were injected with 5 μL of microbeads with a dimeter of about 10 μm (7.2×106 microbeads/mL) in the anterior chamber of the left eye. For the encapsulation experiments, travoprost was solubilized in water/ethanol (50/50) in the presence of AuNPs. The solution was heated (65° C.) in order to evaporate the ethanol and to induce conformational changes of PEG molecules leading to a better encapsulation. The solution was thus completed with water until the initial volume.

**Drug Vector Toxicity**

The AuNPs (77 μmol) were administered topically to the mouse cornea and no external sign of irritation or ocular inflammation appeared.

**Encapsulation of Travoprost**

The characterization of the encapsulation was carried out by UV-visible spectroscopy. Using this characterization technique, it was possible to detect the absorption of travoprost in an aqueous medium demonstrating its solubility via its encapsulation within AuNPs. Moreover, the minimum concentration of AuNPs that encapsulates 0.004% of travoprost, the dose currently used in the market (FIG. 16) was defined. Furthermore, the maximum of the plasmon band of the AuNPs shifted by 20 nm during the titration in water, highlighting the presence of travoprost close to the heart of the AuNPs in the cavities formed by PEGs. These results confirm the ability of AuNPs to effectively encapsulate hydrophobic active molecules.

**Validation of the Model of Hypertensive Glaucoma in Mice.**

Hypertensive glaucoma was induced in adult C57BL/6 mice by injecting 5 μL of polystyrene microbeads (35,000 microbeads) with an average diameter of 10 μm in the anterior chamber of the eye. The dispersion of the microbeads at the level of the iridocorneal angle blocks the passage of the aqueous humor towards the trabecular meshwork (FIG. 17A). Mechanically, the decrease in drainage of the aqueous humor produces an increase in intraocular pressure which is measured with a tonometer of the Tonolab brand. A very significant increase in intraocular pressure was observed ten days after the injection of microbeads in a group of 15 glaucomatous mice (FIG. 17B)

**Improvement by AuNPs of the Effects of Travoprost on Intraocular Pressure in Glaucomatous Mice.**

A comparative experiment was conducted with travoprost with or without AuNPs in glaucomatous mice. Travoprost without AuNPs significantly but transiently decreased intraocular pressure in glaucomatous mice (FIG. 18A); the level of intraocular pressure returned to a high level, similar to that before treatment, after 24 hours. Comparatively, combined treatment of travoprost and AuNPs had a more sustained effect on intraocular pressure, the level of which remained significantly lower after two days (FIGS. 18 B and C). These results demonstrate that these new ultrastable AuNPs are able to double the duration of action of travoprost (length of time that the travoprost is effective) on intraocular pressure, after a single application.
