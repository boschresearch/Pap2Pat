                        "Image-based single-cell transcriptomics, in which RNA species are identified, counted and localized in situ via imaging, naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) is a method for single-cell transcriptome imaging and has been demonstrated to profile hundreds to thousands of RNAs in single cells. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust binary barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. The accuracy of the RNA identification relies on spatially separated signals of individual RNA molecules, which limits the density of RNAs that can be measured and makes the multiplexed imaging of a large number of high abundance RNAs challenging. Accordingly, improvements in imaging techniques are needed."

                        "The present invention generally relates to microscopy, and to systems and methods for imaging or determining nucleic acids or other desired targets, for instance, within cells. In certain aspects, a sample is contained within an expandable material, which is expanded and imaged in some fashion. Expansion of the material improves the effective resolution of the subsequent image. This may be combined, for example, with other super-resolution techniques, such as STORM, and/or with techniques such as MERFISH for determining nucleic acids such as mRNA within the sample, for example, by binding nucleic acid probes to the sample. Other aspects are generally directed to compositions or devices for use in such methods, kits for use in such methods, or the like.",
                        "In certain aspects, a sample is embedded or contained within an expandable material, such as polyelectrolyte gel. The sample may be, for example, a cell or other biological structure, or a non-biological structure in some cases. Upon expansion of the expandable material, the sample is effectively magnified physically, rather than optically. Components of the sample are separated from each other by expansion of the material, but typically retain comparable geometries or topologies, especially if the expansion of the material occurs substantially isotopically. Thus, components that initially started close to each other are now further apart, and can be more easily detected, e.g., using imaging or other techniques.",
                        "Expansion techniques may be combined with techniques for determining nucleic acids such as mRNA within the sample. In some cases, for example, nucleic acids within the sample are attached to the expandable material (for example, covalently) before the expandable material is expanded. The nucleic acids may then be detected, for example, using exposures to nucleic acid probes, e.g., repeatedly, which may be used to determine the distribution of nucleic acids within the material. For example, in techniques such as MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization), a sample is exposed to different rounds of nucleic acid probes, and binding of the nucleic acids can be determined using fluorescence or other techniques. In certain cases, a relatively large number of different targets may be identified using a relatively small number of labels, e.g., by using various combinatorial approaches. Identification may also be enhanced in some embodiments using error-checking and/or error-correcting codes. See, e.g., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/329,683, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Determining Nucleic Acids,\u201d by Zhuang, et al., published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2017/0220733 on Aug. 3, 2017, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                        "In some cases, one or more targets, for example, nucleic acids such as mRNA, may be immobilized relative to the expandable material prior to expansion. In certain embodiments, targets are attached to the expandable material at a single point. This is important in some embodiments since targets attached at two or more points may be expanded along with the material, which may make it more difficult to resolve targets at a high resolution. For example, referring to FIG. 4A, targets 10 and 11 are shown within an expandable material 20. For example, targets 10 and 11 may be nucleic acids. In FIG. 4B, targets 10 and 11 are attached at two points (e.g., their ends), and upon expansion by the expandable material, targets 10 and 11 are expanded (e.g., \u201cstretched\u201d) along with the rest of the expanded material since their anchor points (shown as dots) are expanded along with the expanded material. In contrast, in FIG. 4C, targets 10 and 11 are attached at only one point (shown as a dot), and upon expansion of the expandable material, the targets are not expanded or stretched. Thus, in FIG. 4C, targets 10 and 11 are now further apart, and can be more easily determined, whereas in FIG. 4B targets 10 and 11 may still be physically overlapping and, thus, may produce signals that are not distinguishable despite the expansion process. Accordingly, in certain embodiments of the invention, at least some of the targets, such as nucleic acids, are attached to the expandable material at a single point. In some embodiments, a molecule may behave in the same way as described in FIG. 4C even if it is attached to the gel via multiple attachments, e.g., if the attachments are sufficiently close to one another along the length of the molecule.",
                        "In addition, components of the sample that may be contributing to the background, such as proteins, lipids, and/or other non-targets, may be \u201ccleared\u201d from the sample to improve determination in certain cases. However, nucleic acids or other desired targets may be prevented from also being cleared, for example, by attaching the nucleic acids (or other targets) to the expandable material, as noted above. In this way, expandable materials may be combined with techniques such as MERFISH to facilitate detection of mRNA, other nucleic acids, or other targets. Non-limiting examples of such techniques may be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Apl. Pub. No. 62/419,033, entitled \u201cMatrix Imprinting and Clearing,\u201d incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                        "A variety of techniques may be used to determine binding, including optical techniques such as fluorescence microscopy. In some cases, spatial positions may be determined at super resolutions, or at resolutions better than the wavelength of light or the diffraction limit (although in other embodiments, super resolutions are not required). For example, techniques such as STORM (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) may be used. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,838,302, issued Nov. 23, 2010, entitled \u201cSub-Diffraction Limit Image Resolution and Other Imaging Techniques,\u201d by Zhuang, et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                        "The above discussion is a non-limiting example of one embodiment of the present invention that can be used to determine nucleic acids or other targets in a sample. However, other embodiments are also possible. Accordingly, more generally, various aspects of the invention are directed to various systems and methods for imaging or determining nucleic acids or other desired targets, for instance, within cells or other samples.",
                        "As mentioned, in one aspect, a sample is embedded or contained within an expandable material. The sample may be any suitable sample, and may be biological in some embodiments. In some cases, the sample contains DNA and/or RNA, e.g., that may be determined within the sample. (In other embodiments, other targets within the sample may be determined.) In some cases, the sample may include cells, such as mammalian cells (including human cells), or other types of cells. The sample may contain viruses in some cases. In addition, in some cases, the sample may be a tissue sample, e.g., from a biopsy, artificially grown or cultured, etc.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the expandable material is one that can be expanded, for example, when exposed to water or another suitable liquid. For example, the material may exhibit a relative change in size of at least 1.1, at least 1.2 at least 1.3, at least 1.5, at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 7, at least 10, or at least 15, etc., and/or a relative change in size that is less than 15, less than 10, less than 7, less than 5, less than 4, less than 3, less than 2, less than 1.5, less than 1.3, or less than 1.2 (i.e., a change in size of 2 means that a sample doubles in linear dimension), or inverses of these (i.e., an inverse change in size of 2 means that a sample halves in linear dimensions).",
                        "In some embodiments, the expandable material may be one that does not significantly distort during the expansion process (e.g., the expandable material may expand substantially uniformly or isotropically in all 3 dimensions), although in some cases, the expandable material may exhibit some distortion or non-isotropic expansion. For example, the expandable material may expand in one dimension, relative to an orthogonal dimension, by less than 150%, less than 130%, less than 125%, less than 120%, less than 115%, less than 110%, or less than 105% by linear dimension relative to the shorter linear expansion.",
                        "In some cases, the expandable material is a polymer. Non-limiting examples of suitable polymers include polyelectrolytes and agarose. In some cases, the polymer is a gel or a hydrogel. A variety of polymers can be used in various embodiments including but not limited to acrylic acid, acrylamide, ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimetharcrylate, poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide), methyl cellulose, (ethylene oxide)-(propylene oxide)-(ethylene oxide) terpolymers, sodium alginate, poly(vinyl alcohol), alginate, chitosan, gum Arabic, gelatin, agarose, or the like. In some cases, the polymer may be selected to be relatively optically transparent. In some cases, the expandable material may be formed from monomers or oligomers, for example, comprising one or more substituted or unsubstituted methacrylates, acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylamides, vinylalcohols, vinylamines, allylamines, allylalcohols, including divinylic crosslinkers thereof (e.g., N,N-alkylene bisacrylamides such as N,N-methylenebisacrylamide), or the like. In some cases, polymerization initiators and/or crosslinkers may be present. For example, a precursor may include one or more cross-linking agents, which may be used to cross-link a polymeric expandable material as it forms, e.g., during the polymerization process.",
                        "In some cases, expansion of the expandable material may be facilitated by exposing the material to water, a solution comprising water, or another suitable medium (e.g., a liquid medium). Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that water flow into the material may facilitate the expansion of the expandable material. In certain embodiments, the solution may be hypotonic relative to the expandable material, which may facilitate the transport of water into the expandable material, e.g., due to differences in tonicity. Other ways of expanding polymers may be used in other embodiments, such as through changes in the pH, changes in an external electric/magnetic field, changes in temperature, response to light, etc.",
                        "In some cases, expansion of the material may be restricted after the expansion has occurred. For example, the material may be stabilized so that exchange of other buffers does not cause a change in size. This stabilization may occur, for example, via chemical modification of the expandable material, or embedding of the expandable material in a second material that is not expandable.",
                        "As a non-limiting example, a sample may be exposed to one or more monomers or other precursors which can react to form the expandable material. In some cases, the precursors may be permeated, diffused, or otherwise transported through the sample, before being reacted. For instance, in some cases, a precursor may be present in a liquid (e.g., water, saline, or other aqueous medium), which may permeate through a sample in some fashion.",
                        "In some cases, the sample may be embedded within a relatively large polymer or gel, which can then be sectioned or sliced in some cases to produce smaller portions for analysis, e.g., using various microtomy techniques commonly available to those of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, tissues or organs may be immobilized within a suitable polymer or gel.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the expansion of the gel may disentangle molecules that were physically overlapping. In a non-limiting example, two RNA molecules may physically overlap within the sample. By anchoring these RNA molecules at one location, the expansion of the gel may separate these molecules so that they are no longer physically overlapping as long as the attachment points for each RNA are sufficiently separated within the sample. In some embodiments, for example, if the RNA molecules are anchored to the gel at multiple locations along their length, then expansion of the gel may not physically separate these two molecules. Rather, expansion of the gel may stretch these molecules between the attachment points, leaving the two regions of these molecules that were overlapping still overlapping after expansion. In this case, these molecules may not be capable of being physically distinguished, e.g., by optical techniques. In some cases, anchoring methods that are deterministic (e.g., that target a specific location of the RNA) versus random (e.g., that target a large number of different locations on the RNA with the specific targeted location selected at random), may differ in the probability that RNAs will be anchored in multiple locations to the gel and, thus, be unable to be physically separated when overlapping. Specific targeting of the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 end, or a defined location, within the RNA may in some cases lead to deterministic anchoring that will not stretch RNAs. Moreover, it should be understood that although RNA was used in this example, such considerations also apply to any other biomolecules within samples, e.g. DNA, or other targets described herein.",
                        "In one aspect, a sample that is expanded may be imaged or studied to determine nucleic acids or other desired targets, for instance, within cells, tissues or other samples contained within an expandable material. Techniques useful for determining nucleic acids or other desired targets include, but are not limited to, MERFISH, smFISH, or techniques such as those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

                        "If nucleic acids are desired to be determined, the nucleic acids may be, for example, DNA, RNA, or other nucleic acids that are present within a cell (or other sample). The nucleic acids may be endogenous to the cell, or added to the cell. For instance, the nucleic acid may be viral, or artificially created. In some cases, the nucleic acid to be determined may be expressed by the cell. The nucleic acid is RNA in some embodiments. The RNA may be coding and/or non-coding RNA. Non-limiting examples of RNA that may be studied within the cell include mRNA, siRNA, rRNA, miRNA, tRNA, lncRNA, snoRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, piRNAs, or the like.",

For example, in some cases, at least 4 genomic segments are determined within a cell, and in some cases, at least 3, at least 4, at least 7, at least 8, at least 12, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 22, at least 30, at least 31, at least 32, at least 50, at least 63, at least 64, at least 72, at least 75, at least 100, at least 127, at least 128, at least 140, at least 255, at least 256, at least 500, at least 1,000, at least 1,500, at least 2,000, at least 2,500, at least 3,000, at least 4,000, at least 5,000, at least 7,500, at least 10,000, at least 12,000, at least 15,000, at least 20,000, at least 25,000, at least 30,000, at least 40,000, at least 50,000, at least 75,000, or at least 100,000 genomic segments may be determined within a cell.",
                        "In some cases, the entire genome of a cell may be determined. It should be understood that the genome generally encompasses all DNA molecules produced within a cell, not just chromosome DNA. Thus, for instance, the genome may also include, in some cases, mitochondria DNA, chloroplast DNA, plasmid DNA, etc. In some embodiments, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or 100% of the genome of a cell may be determined.",
                        "However, as discussed, it should be understood that in other embodiments of the invention, other targets may be determined or immobilized, e.g., in addition to and/or instead of nucleic acids. For example, in some embodiments of the invention, the targets to be determined or immobilized may include proteins (e.g., antibodies, enzymes, structural proteins), lipids, carbohydrates, viruses, or the like. In one embodiment, cellular components, such as proteins, can be detected by binding to them proteins, such as antibodies/immunoglobulins (primary antibodies, secondary antibodies, nanobodies, fragments of antibodies, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE, etc.), that are conjugated to oligonucleotide probes which are anchored to the polymer or gel. These components could then be removed, leaving the oligonucleotide probes to be detected via hybridization of additional nucleic acid probes, similar or identical to the detection of cellular nucleic acids. In another embodiment, multiple distinct cellular species could be detected simultaneously within the same sample, even if the original components are removed from the gel or polymer. For example, RNA molecules could be detected via hybridization of nucleic acid probes simultaneously with the detection of proteins via antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, as described above.",
                        "As mentioned, the sample can be immobilized or embedded within a polymer or a gel, partially or completely. For example, the sample may be embedded in an expandable material as discussed above. In one set of embodiments, anchor probes may be used during the polymerization process. The anchor probes may include an anchor portion that is able to polymerize with the expandable material, e.g., during and/or after the polymerization process, and a targeting portion that is able to immobilize a target, e.g., chemically and/or physically. For example, in the case of polyacrylamide, the anchor probe may include an acrydite portion that can polymerize and become incorporated into the polymer. As another example, an anchor probe may contain, as a targeting portion, a sequence of nucleic acids that is complementary to a target that is a nucleic acid, such as RNA (e.g., mRNA) or DNA. The targeting portion may be specific to a target, and/or may randomly associate with different targets within a sample (for example, due to non-specific binding). Other portions may be present within the anchor probes as well.",
                        "For example, to associate with a target nucleic acid, the anchor probe may comprise a nucleic acid sequence substantially complementary to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. For instance, the nucleic acid may be complementary to at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 or more nucleotides of the nucleic acid. In some cases the complementarity may be exact (Watson-Crick complementarity), or there may be 1, 2, or more mismatches.",
                        "Thus, the anchor probe may contain a portion that can interact with and bind to nucleic acid molecules in some embodiments, and/or other molecules in which immobilization is desired, e.g., proteins or lipids, other desired targets, etc. The immobilization may be covalent or non-covalent. For example, to immobilize a target nucleic acid, the anchor probe may comprise a nucleic acid comprising an acrydite portion (e.g., at the 5\u2032 end, the 3\u2032 end, an internal base, etc.), and a portion able to recognize the target nucleic acid.",
                        "In some cases, the anchor probe can be configured to immobilize mRNA, e.g., in the case of transcriptome analysis. For instance, in one set of embodiments, the anchor probe may contain a plurality of thymine nucleotides, e.g., sequentially, for binding to the poly-A tail of an mRNA. Thus, for example, the anchor probe can have at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 or more consecutive thymine nucleotides (e.g., a poly-dT portion) within the anchor probe. In some cases, at least some of the thymine nucleotides may be \u201clocked\u201d thymine nucleotides. These may comprise at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, or at least 80% of these thymine nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the locked and non-locked nucleotides may alternate. Such locked thymine nucleotides may be useful, for example, to stabilize the hybridization of the poly-A tails of the mRNA with the anchor probe.",
                        "In another set of embodiments, the anchor probe may comprise a sequence substantially complementary to mRNA (or another target nucleic acid), as noted above. The sequence may be substantially complementary to all, or only a portion, of the target nucleic acid, for example, an end portion (e.g., towards a 5\u2032 end or a 3\u2032 end), or a middle portion between the end portions. For example, a nucleic acid may be immobilized using anchor probes having substantially complementary portions to the DNA or RNA target. There may be, e.g., 5 or more, 6 or more, 7 or more, 8 or more, 9 or more, 10 or more, 12 or more, 13 or more, 14 or more, 15 or more, 20 or more, 25 or more, 30 or more, 35 or more, 40 or more, 45 or more, or 50 or more complementary nucleotides between the anchor probe and the nucleic acid.",
                        "In another set of embodiments, a plurality of anchor probes may be targeted via the methods described above to each RNA of interests. For example, 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more, 5 or more, 10 or more, 15 or more, or 20 or more distinct nucleic acid anchor probes may be targeted to a given RNA. These probes may be targeted to a small region of this RNA such that if multiple probes bind and anchor the RNA to the gel, the majority of the RNA remains unstretched during expansion. If multiple RNA species are targeted at a time, then the number of unique anchor probes applied to the sample may be, for example, 5 or more, 10 or more, 15 or more, 20 or more, 100 or more, 200 or more, 1,000 or more, or 10,000 or more.",
                        "Other methods may be used to anchor nucleic acids, or other molecules in which immobilization is desired. In one set of embodiments, nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA may be immobilized by covalent bonding. For example, in one set of embodiments, an alkylating agent may be used that covalently binds to RNA or DNA and contains a second chemical moiety that can be incorporated into the polyelectrolytes as it is polymerized. In yet another set of embodiments, the terminal ribose in an RNA molecule may be oxidized using sodium periodate (or another oxidizing agent) to produce an aldehyde, which may be cross-linked to acrylamide, or other polymer or gel. In other embodiments, chemical agents that are able to modify bases may be used, such as aldehydes, e.g. paraformaldehyde or gluteraldehyde, alkylating agents, or succinimidyl-containing groups; chemical agents that modify the terminal phosphate, such as carbodiimides, e.g., EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide); chemical agents that modify internal sugars, such as p-maleimido-phenyl isocyanate; or chemical agents that modify terminal sugars, such as sodium periodate. In some cases, these chemical agents can carry a second chemical moiety that can then be directly cross-linked to the gel or polymer, and/or which can be further modified with a compound that can be directly cross linked to the gel or polymer.",
                        "In still another set of embodiments, the nucleic acids may be physically tangled within the polymer or gel, e.g., due to their length, and, thus, unable to diffuse from their original location within the gel.",
                        "Similar anchor probes may be used to immobilize other components to a polymer or gel, in other embodiments. For example, in one set of embodiments, an antibody able to specifically bind to a suitable target (e.g., another protein, a lipid, a carbohydrate, a virus, etc.) may be modified to include an acrydite moiety that can become incorporated within a polymer or gel.",
                        "In addition, it should be understood that the embedding of the sample within the expandable material and the immobilization of nucleic acids (or other desired targets) may be performed in any suitable order in various embodiments. For instance, immobilization may occur before, during, or after embedding of the sample. In some cases, the target may be chemically modified or reacted to cross-link to the gel or polymer before or during formation of the gel or polymer.",
                        "As mentioned, in some embodiments of the invention, the anchor probes immobilize a target, such as a nucleic acid, to the expandable material at a single point. In some cases, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% (by number) of the targets immobilized to the expandable material are immobilized at a single point. By using only a single point, relatively large numbers of targets may be immobilized relative to the expandable material, without necessarily affecting function of the targets. For example, multiple points of attachment may potentially disrupt the structure of the target, e.g., due to \u201cstretching\u201d of the target during expansion of the expandable material (see, e.g., FIGS. 4A-4C), or due to substitutions or distortions of the target due to the anchor (for example, if the anchoring occurs at or near a site used for binding or structural stability, etc.). However, it should be understood that in some embodiments, targets may be attached to the expandable material at more than one point.",
                        "A variety of techniques may be used to attach a target such as a nucleic acid (e.g., RNA or DNA) at a single point. For example, anchor probes may be used that are complementary to specific regions of a nucleic acid (e.g., based on sequence complementarity). In some cases, the anchor probes may be specific to each nucleic acid individually (e.g., having unique nucleic acid sequences that are complementary to that nucleic acid's sequence). Nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA can thus be immobilized to an expandable material, e.g., at a single point or region controlled by the sequence of nucleic acids within the anchor probe. In other embodiments, however, the anchor probes may include nucleic acids that are complementary to a common feature of the nucleic acid, such as the poly-A tail of an mRNA, such that the same anchor probes can immobilize several different nucleic acids (e.g., different mRNA sequences within a sample).",
                        "In addition, in some embodiments, more than one type of anchor probe may be used, for example, targeting the same or different portions of a target. For instance, in some embodiments, one or more anchor probes may be applied to a sample such that even if not every target is anchored by every anchor probe, a substantial percentage of targets is immobilized to the expandable material. In some cases, for example, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% of the targets are immobilized to the expandable material, e.g., via one or more anchor probes.",
                        "Other approaches may be used to anchor nucleic acids besides complementary nucleic acid sequences. For example, in one set of embodiments, the 3\u2032OH end of an RNA molecule may be targeted, e.g., chemically, for immobilization to the expandable material. For example, a 3\u2032OH end may be converted into an aldehyde via oxidation with agents such as periodate (e.g., sodium periodate or potassium periodate). The aldehyde can then be reacted with hydrazines, amines, or other moieties that can render the anchor probe capable of being incorporated into the expandable material. For example, a hydrazine or an amine can be linked to chemical moieties such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, or other chemicals capable of being incorporated into an expandable material such as polyacrylamide. Additional examples of attachment techniques have been previously described above. Thus, RNA molecules may in some embodiments be anchored only at their 3\u2032OH ends.",
                        "As another non-limiting example, the 3\u2032OH could be a site by which enzymatic extension of the RNA could add an anchor probe. For example, polyA polymerase could be used to add modified A nucleotides to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA molecule. These A nucleotides can serve as a binding site for polyT probes as described above. As another example, the A nucleotides may be chemically modified such that they contains an appropriate chemical moiety that can be used to anchor the RNA. For example, adenosine nucleotides that contain the click-chemistry reagent azide can be purchased commercially. This could then be reacted with a DBCO group (dibenzocyclooctyne) that is linked to a methacrylate group via an NHS ester, which can then be incorporated into an expandable material, thereby immobilizing the RNA via the 3\u2032OH end to the expandable material.",
                        "As still another example, in some embodiments, the 5\u2032 end of an RNA molecule may be targeted, e.g., chemically, for immobilization to the expandable material. For example, carbodiimide groups can be used to react with the 5\u2032 phosphate present on uncapped RNA molecules. Capped RNA molecules could be decapped using decapping enzymes such as Dcp2 (mRNA-decapping enzyme 2). For example, cross linkers such as EDC (1-ethyl-3-3-dimethyl-aminopropyl carbodiimide) could be reacted with decapped RNAs to specifically label the 5\u2032 end of the RNA. These molecules could then be attached to anchor moieties such as acrylamide or methacrylate, e.g., by reaction with methacrylate molecules containing a primary amine. Such moieties can then be incorporated into an expandable material, thereby immobilizing the RNA via the 5\u2032 end to the expandable material.",
                        "Other molecules, such as proteins, may also be anchored to the expanded matrix, in various embodiments. For example, proteins could be labeled with reagents that contain anchor moieties. A variety of methods can be used for chemical modification of proteins, including crosslinking to amines via aldehydes, crosslinking to cysteines via disulfide bonds or maleimide, etc. Proteins could also be anchored in some embodiments to the expandable gel via interactions with antibodies, which may be labeled in the above fashion.",
                        "After immobilization of nucleic acids, or other suitable molecules, to the polymer or gel, other components within the sample may be \u201ccleared.\u201d Such clearance may include removal of the components, and/or degradation of the components (e.g., to smaller components, components that are not fluorescent, etc.) that are not the desired target. In some cases, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% of the undesired components within the sample may be cleared. Multiple clearance steps can also be performed in certain embodiments, e.g., to remove various undesired components. As discussed, it is believed that the removal of such components may decrease background during analysis (for example, by decreasing background and/or off-target binding), while desired components (such as nucleic acids) can be immobilized and thus not cleared.",
                        "For example, proteins may be cleared from the sample using enzymes, denaturants, chelating agents, chemical agents, and the like, which may break down the proteins into smaller components and/or amino acids. These smaller components may be easier to remove physically, and/or may be sufficiently small or inert such that they do not significantly affect the background. Similarly, lipids may be cleared from the sample using surfactants or the like. In some cases, one or more of these are used, e.g., simultaneously or sequentially. Non-limiting examples of suitable enzymes include proteinases such as proteinase K, proteases or peptidases, or digestive enzymes such as trypsin, pepsin, or chymotrypsin. Non-limiting examples of suitable denaturants include guanidine HCl, acetone, acetic acid, urea, or lithium perchlorate. Non-limiting examples of chemical agents able to denature proteins include solvents such as phenol, chloroform, guanidinium isocyananate, urea, formamide, etc. Non-limiting examples of surfactants include Triton X-100 (polyethylene glycol p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenyl ether), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), Igepal CA-630, or poloxamers. Non-limiting examples of chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citrate, or polyaspartic acid. In some embodiments, compounds such as these may be applied to the sample to clear proteins, lipids, and/or other components. For instance, a buffer solution (e.g., containing Tris or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) may be applied to the sample, then removed.",
                        "Non-limiting examples of DNA enzymes that may be used to remove DNA include DNase I, dsDNase, a variety of restriction enzymes, etc. Non-limiting examples of techniques to clear RNA include RNA enzymes such as RNase A, RNase T, or RNase H, or chemical agents, e.g., via alkaline hydrolysis (for example, by increasing the pH to greater than 10). Non-limiting examples of systems to remove sugars or extracellular matrix include enzymes such as chitinase, heparinases, or other glycosylases. Non-limiting examples of systems to remove lipids include enzymes such as lipidases, chemical agents such as alcohols (e.g., methanol or ethanol), or detergents such as Triton X-100 or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Many of these are readily available commercially. In this way, the background of the sample may be removed, which may facilitate analysis of the nucleic acid probes or other desired targets, e.g., using fluorescence microscopy, or other techniques as discussed herein. As mentioned, in various embodiments, various targets (e.g., nucleic acids, certain proteins, lipids, viruses, or the like) may be immobilized, while other non-targets may be cleared using suitable agents or enzymes. As a non-limiting example, if a protein (such as an antibody) is immobilized, then RNA enzymes, DNA enzymes, systems to remove lipids, sugars, etc. may be used.",

WO 2016/018960 or WO 2016/018963, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Techniques for fixing cells and tissues are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As non-limiting examples, a cell may be fixed using chemicals such as formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetic acid, or the like. In one embodiment, a cell may be fixed using Hepes-glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent (HOPE). The cells may be fixed, in some embodiments, prior to formation and/or after formation of the expandable material. In some cases, the cells are fixed prior to expansion of the expandable material.",

The nucleic acid probe typically contains a target sequence that is able to bind to at least a portion of a target nucleic acid, in some cases specifically. When introduced into a cell or other sample, the nucleic acid probe may be able to bind to a specific target nucleic acid (e.g., an mRNA, or other nucleic acids as discussed herein). In some cases, the nucleic acid probes may be determined using signaling entities (e.g., as discussed below), and/or by using secondary nucleic acid probes able to bind to the nucleic acid probes (i.e., to primary nucleic acid probes).

In some cases, only a portion of the nucleic acids encoding the protein are used, e.g., having the lengths as discussed above. In addition, in some cases, more than one target sequence that can be used to identify a particular target may be used. For instance, multiple probes can be used, sequentially and/or simultaneously, that can bind to or hybridize to different regions of the same target.

In some embodiments, the codeword may be subjected to error detection and/or correction. For instance, the codewords may be organized such that, if no match is found for a given set of read sequences or binding pattern of nucleic acid probes, then the match may be identified as an error, and optionally, error correction may be applied sequences to determine the correct target for the nucleic acid probes.

In some cases, error correction can also be applied to determine the correct codeword, and thus resulting in the correct identity of the nucleic acid target. In some cases, the codewords may be selected such that, assuming that there is only one error present, only one possible correct codeword is available, and thus, only one correct identity of the nucleic acid target is possible. In some cases, this may also be generalized to larger codeword spacings or Hamming distances; for instance, the codewords may be selected such that if two, three, or four errors are present (or more in some cases), only one possible correct codeword is available, and thus, only one correct identity of the nucleic acid targets is possible.",

In yet another embodiment, laser illumination may be passed through a series of lenslet arrays to produce overlapping images of the illumination that approximate a flat illumination field.",
                        "In some embodiments, the centroids of the spatial positions of the entities may be determined. For example, a centroid of a signaling entity may be determined within an image or series of images using image analysis algorithms known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some cases, the algorithms may be selected to determine non-overlapping single emitters and/or partially overlapping single emitters in a sample. Non-limiting examples of suitable techniques include a maximum likelihood algorithm, a least squares algorithm, a Bayesian algorithm, a compressed sensing algorithm, or the like. Combinations of these techniques may also be used in some cases.",

For example, in some embodiments, a first secondary nucleic acid probe containing a signaling entity may be applied to a sample that can recognize a first read sequence, then the first secondary nucleic acid probe can be inactivated before a second secondary nucleic acid probe is applied to the sample. If multiple signaling entities are used, the same or different techniques may be used to inactivate the signaling entities, and some or all of the multiple signaling entities may be inactivated, e.g., sequentially or simultaneously.",
                        "Inactivation may be caused by removal of the signaling entity (e.g., from the sample, or from the nucleic acid probe, etc.), and/or by chemically altering the signaling entity in some fashion, e.g., by photobleaching the signaling entity, bleaching or chemically altering the structure of the signaling entity, e.g., by reduction, etc.). For instance, in one set of embodiments, a fluorescent signaling entity may be inactivated by chemical or optical techniques such as oxidation, photobleaching, chemically bleaching, stringent washing or enzymatic digestion or reaction by exposure to an enzyme, dissociating the signaling entity from other components (e.g., a probe), chemical reaction of the signaling entity (e.g., to a reactant able to alter the structure of the signaling entity) or the like.

For instance, in one embodiment, the signaling entity is fluorescent. In other embodiments, the signaling entity may be phosphorescent, radioactive, absorptive, etc. In some cases, the signaling entity is any entity that can be determined within a sample at relatively high resolutions, e.g., at resolutions better than the wavelength of visible light or the diffraction limit.

In another embodiment, the fluorophore may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide via one or more phosphorothioate modified nucleotides in which the sulfur modification replaces the bridging and/or non-bridging oxygen. The fluorophore may be cleaved from the oligonucleotide, in certain embodiments, via addition of compounds such as but not limited to iodoethanol, iodine mixed in ethanol, silver nitrate, or mercury chloride.

In yet another set of embodiments, a fluorophore may be conjugated to biotin, and the oligonucleotide conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. An interaction between biotin and avidin or streptavidin allows the fluorophore to be conjugated to the oligonucleotide, while sufficient exposure to an excess of addition, free biotin could \u201coutcompete\u201d the linkage and thereby cause cleavage to occur.

In these examples, RNAs are anchored to a polymer gel that were expanded 12-fold in volume to physically lower RNA densities. With this, accurate identification of RNAs was demonstrated in a MERFISH library composed of abundant RNAs, the total density of which was >10 fold higher than previously measured RNA libraries.",

                                "In situ imaging-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics allow not only the expression profile of individual cells to be determined, but also the spatial positions of individual RNA molecules to be localized. These approaches provide powerful means to map the spatial organizations of RNAs inside cells and the transcriptionally distinct cells in tissues. Currently available image-based single-cell RNA profiling methods rely on either multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or in situ sequencing. In particular, multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH), a massively multiplexed form of single-molecule FISH (smFISH), allows RNA imaging at the transcriptomic scale. As a powerful method that images individual RNA molecules inside cells, smFISH provides the precise copy number and spatial organization of RNAs in single cells. MERFISH multiplexes smFISH measurements by labeling RNAs combinatorically with oligonucleotide probes which contain error-robust barcodes and measuring these barcodes through sequential rounds of smFISH imaging. Using this approach, simultaneous imaging of hundreds to thousands of RNA species in individual cells using error detection/correction barcoding schemes have been demonstrated. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Apl. Pub. No. 2017-0220733, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Determining Nucleic Acids,\u201d and U.S. Pat. Apl. Pub.

However, due to the diffraction limit, when molecules are sufficiently close to each other, their fluorescent signals will overlap, limiting the density of RNAs that can be imaged simultaneously. This problem can be overcome, for example, by super-resolution imaging methods, either through optical means or through sample expansion. These examples illustrates sample expansion and expansion microscopy (ExM) to substantially improve the ability to resolve nearby molecules.",
                                "In this approach, the desired signal is conjugated to an expandable polyacrylamide gel, and then the gel is physically expanded by changing the ionic strength of the buffer, separating molecules that would have otherwise produced overlapping fluorescent signals. These examples demonstrates an approach to combine MERFISH and expansion microscopy. The mRNAs is anchored to an expandable polymer gel though acrydite-modified poly-dT oligonucleotides and imaged a high-abundance RNA library in cultured human osteosarcoma cells (U-2 OS), which contains \u02dc130 RNA species. Without gel expansion, these RNAs were not well resolved and hence detected with a relatively low detection efficiency of \u02dc15-20%. In contrast, in expanded sample, individual RNA molecules became well resolved, leading to a substantial increase in their detection efficiency. Comparison with smFISH and bulk sequencing results demonstrated that these RNAs in the expanded sample were detected with high accuracy and near 100% efficiency. These examples also demonstrated the ability to do simultaneous MERFISH RNA imaging and immunofluorescence imaging of proteins in these expanded samples."

To illustrate the effect of RNA density on multiplexed smFISH measurements, a high-abundance 129-RNA library was measured using a previously published 16-bit modified Hamming distance 4 (MHD4) binary codes, which allows error detection and correction. This code includes 140 unique code words, and \u02dc129 of them were used to encode the RNAs. \u02dc11 were used as blank controls that do not correspond to any RNA. Among the 129 targeted RNAs, 106 were in the abundance range of 40-250 copies per cell, and the remaining 23 spanned an abundance range of 1-1000 copies per cell to quantify performance across different abundances. The total abundance of RNAs in this library was 14-fold higher than a 130-RNA library previously measured using the MHD4 code with \u02dc80-90% detection efficiency.",

In the first step, each cellular RNA was hybridized with a complex set of oligonucleotide probes termed \u201cencoding probes,\u201d which contained targeting sequences that bind cellular RNAs and readout sequences that determines the barcodes of these RNAs. In second step, the readout sequences, and hence the barcodes, were detected through a series of smFISH measurements, each round with one or more readout probe complementary to one or more readout sequence. MERFISH measurements were carried out in U-2 OS cells using matrix-imprinting-based clearing methods. See U.S. Pat. Apl. Pub. No. 62/419,033, entitled \u201cMatrix Imprinting and Clearing,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, labeled with encoding probes to the 129 RNA species as well as acrydite-modified poly-dT probes that target polyadenylated (polyA) RNAs. The cells were embedded in a polymer gel and cellular proteins and lipids removed by Proteinase K digestion and detergent extraction, while the polyA RNAs were anchored to the gel through the poly-dT probes. After the clearing, eight rounds of two-color smFISH measurements, each with two readout probes, were carried out to read out the 16-bit barcodes on the RNAs, chemical cleavage was used to remove the fluorophores that were linked to the readout probes between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging. Because the height of the cells were greater than the thickness of a single optical section, the sample was imaged with multiple z-sections to ensure that >90% RNA molecules within the cells were detected.",
                                "Unlike previous MERFISH measurements on lower abundance RNA libraries because of the high molecular density associated with this 14-fold higher abundance RNA library, a substantial fraction of smFISH signals overlap in space in each round of imaging (FIG. 1A, B). As a result, only a small fraction of the RNA molecules were decodable (FIG. 1C). Comparison with bulk RNA-seq shows that the average copy number per cell detected for these RNAs by MERFISH correlated with the RNA abundance measured by RNA-seq with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.6 between the log10 values (FIG. 1D). To determine the detection efficiency, the MERFISH results were compared with the smFISH measurements for 12 genes in this library, also carried out using the matrix-imprinting-based clearing method.

It is believed that the reduced MERFISH detection efficiency may be due, in part, to overlapping single-molecule signals. This problem can be overcome, as is shown in this example, by super-resolution imaging methods, either through optical means or through sample expansion. This example illustrates sample expansion with molecules anchored at a single location and expansion microscopy (ExM) to increase the distance between molecules and substantially improve the ability to resolve nearby molecules.",
                                "In this example, cells were fixed and permeabilized, and labeled with encoding probes and poly-dT anchoring probes as described above. Then the cells were embedded in an expandable polymer gel. Afterwards, cells were digested by Proteinase K to remove proteins and homogenize the mechanical properties of the gel. The gel was then expanded in low salt buffer and finally embedded again in a non-expandable gel to stabilize it in the expanded state (FIG. 2A). The RNA was anchored to the gel at its poly(A) tail, which creates a single-pointed contact between individual RNA molecules and the gel and avoids stretching the mRNA during expansion process. This should facilitate separation of the nearby molecules. MERFISH encoding probes were stained before embedding samples in a gel since it was found that MERFISH probes did not penetrate reliably well after samples were embedded twice, at least in some embodiments. A low salt buffer (0.5\u00d7 saline-sodium citrate (SSC)) was used instead of water for dialysis to preserve specific binding of probes during expansion, which resulted in a lower expansion factor. Measurements of the gel volume showed that dialysis in 0.5\u00d7 saline-sodium citrate (SSC) produced a 12-fold expansion in volume. It was noted that as long as the expansion is sufficient to separate neighboring RNA molecules, a lower expansion factor had the advantage of allowing faster imaging, in certain applications.",

Comparison with smFISH measurements showed that the copy numbers per cell determined by MERFISH was 105%+/\u22129% (average+/\u2212SEM) or 111% (median) of those determined by smFISH (FIG. 2H), indicating that the detection efficiency after expansion was close to 100%.",

A cell is a highly complex system composed of different structures and compartments and immunofluorescence is a powerful technique to visualize specific subcellular structures and compartments. This example thus tested whether combination of immunofluorescence and MERFISH imaging was possible in the expanded samples. Expansion microscopy has been demonstrated in immunostained samples, using oligo-conjugated antibodies and complementary probes with a methacryloyl group to incorporate signals into the gel. These oligos then mark the positions of the protein target and can be detected by hybridization of fluorophore-labeled complementary oligos, which were incorporated into the MERFISH readout measurements. In the experimental procedure, immunostaining was performed of the protein targets with oligo-labeled (secondary) antibodies after hybridization of the cells with the MERFISH encoding probes and RNA anchor probes, and then the labeled sample was embedded in an expandable gel. Acrydite modification was added to the oligo on the antibodies so that it could be incorporated into the polymer gel during the embedding step. After digestion, gel expansion and second embedding in a non-expandable gel as described above, the MERFISH readout procedure was performed to first detect the readout sequences in the RNA encoding probes and then with an additional round of FISH detection to read out the oligo sequences representing the protein target.",

The combination with immunofluorescence did not affect MERFISH imaging quality (FIGS. 3E and 3F). The same high correlation of MERFISH results and the RNA-seq results with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log10 values (FIG. 3E) was observed. The average copy numbers per RNA species per cell detected in immunostained samples correlated strongly with those in detected samples not subjected to immunostaining, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95 between the log10 values (FIG. 3F). On average, the ratio of copy numbers per RNA species per cell between immunostained and non-immunostained samples is 99%+/\u22123% (SEM), indicating negligible impairment in performance of MERFISH when combined with immunofluorescence. The staining of cadherin in expanded and MERFISH labeled samples also looked similar to cadherin staining in control U-2 OS samples immuostained directly after fixation without MERFISH imaging of the RNA (FIG. 3G). To quantify whether antibody staining was affected by MERFISH RNA labeling, gel embedding, digestion, and expansion procedures, the cadherin intensity per unit length on the cell periphery (normalized to the actual length before expansion) was compared in expansion MERFISH samples versus control samples, with comparable results (FIG. 3H).",

The use of oligo-conjugated antibodies potentially allows visualizing many proteins in sequential rounds of hybridization and imaging using just one or a few spectrally distinct fluorophores.

                                "Design of the encoding probes. The MERFISH-encoding probes were designed using 16-bit Hamming-weight-4 Hamming-distance-4 code with 140 possible barcodes. In this encoding scheme, all barcodes used were separated by a Hamming distance of at least 4, and hence at least four bits must be read incorrectly to change one valid barcode to another. Constant Hamming weight (i.e. the number of \u201c1\u201d bits in each barcodes) of 4 is used to avoid potential measurement bias due to differential rate of \u201c1\u201d to \u201c0\u201d and \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d errors. The encoding probe set contained 92 encoding probes per RNA. Each encoding probe was comprised of a 30-nt target region designed using a pipeline, flanked by two 20-nt readout sequences randomly selected out of the four ones assigned to each RNA, one 20-nt priming region at the 5\u2032 end and another 20-nt priming region using the reverse complement of the T7 promoter at the 3\u2032 end. Additional adenosine nucleotide spacers were added between readout sequences and target regions to prevent terminal guanine triplets in the readout sequences and to prevent target regions from combining with Gs from adjacent sequences to form G quadruplets. The priming region at the 5\u2032 end had a thymine at the end, which was put at the junction of the priming regions at the 5\u2032 end and the encoding region. This was designed to incorporate a uracil on the forward primer used in the reverse transcription step of probe construction, which can be cleaved by Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent (USER) Enzyme. The cleavable primer design together with using reverse complement of the T7 promoter as a second primer allowed construction of encoding probes with a length of 72 nt. The reduction in probe length may facilitate penetration of probes and reduce non-specific binding.",
                                "To include some abundant but short RNAs in our library, instead of designing probes targeting distinct regions of RNAs, the probes were allowed to share up to 20 nt with another probe. This modification helped increase the number of probes that could be designed for each gene by 2 fold. 92 target regions per RNA were selected randomly out of all potential target regions of an RNA. By allowing up to a 20-nt overlap between neighboring encoding probes, this design allowed RNAs as short as 1,200 nt to be targeted by 92 encoding probes with a 30-nt targeting sequence. Because a given cellular RNA is typically bound by less than one third of the 92 encoding probes, the encoding probes with overlapping targeting regions were expected to not substantially interfere with each other, but would partially compensate for reduced binding due to local inaccessible regions on the target RNA (e.g. secondary structure) or loss of probe during synthesis.",
                                "Construction of the encoding probes. The encoding probe set was constructed from complex oligonucleotide pools. Briefly, the oligopools (CustomArray) were amplified via limited-cycle PCR to make in vitro transcription templates, converted these templates into RNA via in vitro transcription (New England Biolabs), and converted the RNA back to DNA via reverse transcription (Maxima RT H, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The probes were then digested by USER Enzyme (New England Biolabs) at a dilution of 1:30 (vol/vol) incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 h to cleave off the priming region at the site of a uracil between a priming regions at the 5\u2032 end and the target region. After that, DNA was purified via alkaline hydrolysis to remove RNA and column purification (Zymo Research). The final probes were resuspended in RNAase-free water and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.",
                                "Oligo conjugation to secondary antibodies. Oligonucleotides containing the desired readout probes were conjugated to secondary antibodies via a combination of NHS-ester and copper-free click chemistries. First, secondary antibodies were labeled with a copper-free click crosslinking agent using NHS-ester chemistry. Specifically, azide preservative was removed from the unconjugated Donkey Anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermoscientific) using a spin-column based dialysis membrane (Amicon, 100 kDa molecular weight cut off) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The NHS-ester, PEGS, DBCO cross linker (Kerafast) was diluted to a concentration of 10 micromolar in anhydrous DMSO (Thermoscientific). 2 microliters of this cross linker was then combined with 100 microliters of 2 mg/mL of the antibody in 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and then terminated via a second round of purification using the Amicon columns as described above. The average number of DBCO crosslinkers per antibody was determined via the relative absorption of the sample at 280 nm (antibody) and 309 nm (DBCO). On average the crosslinker amounts described above produced \u02dc7 DBCO crosslinkers per antibody.",
                                "Oligonucleotide probes containing the desired sequence as well as a 5\u2032-acrydite, to allow cross linking to the polymer gel, and a 3\u2032-azide, to allow crosslinking to the DBCO-labeled antibodies, were ordered from IDT and suspended to 100 micromolar in 1\u00d7PBS. 20 microliters of the appropriate oligonucleotide was then added to 100 microliters of the DBCO-labeled antibodies at a final concentration of \u02dc2 mg/mL. This reaction was incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for at least 12 hours. Labeled antibodies were not further purified as residual oligonucleotides, not conjugated to antibodies, are expected to be readily washed away from samples.",

It was found that >90% of RNAs located in the first 5 micrometer-depth volume in unexpanded samples and in the first 12 micrometer-depth volume in expanded samples from the surface of coverslips. Thus, a 5 micrometer-depth volume was scanned for unexpanded samples and a 12 micrometer-depth volume was scanned for expanded samples with a step size of 1 micrometer.

Briefly, z-stacks at each location from different imaging rounds were corrected for lateral offsets based on the location of fiducial beads. Corrected z-stacks were high-pass filtered to remove background, deconvolved to tighten RNA spots, and then low-pass filtered to connect RNA centroids that differed slightly in location between images. To correct for differences in the brightness between color channels, images were first normalized by equalizing their intensity histograms and refined further via an iterative process to remove substantial variation in the fluorescence intensity between different bits. The set of 16 normalized intensity values (corresponding to 16 readout probe imaging) observed for each pixel in each FOV at each focal plane represented a vector in a 16-dimensional space. The pixel vector was normalized and compared to each of the 140 barcodes in the 16-bit MHD4 code. A pixel was assigned to a barcode if the Euclidean distance between the vector and a barcode was smaller than a given threshold defined by the distance of a single-bit error. Adjacent pixels were combined into a single putative RNA using a 3-D connectivity array with maximal neighborhood connectivity. Cell boundaries were calculated using the watershed algorithm based on the inverted barcode density with DAPI-stained regions as initial seeds.",
