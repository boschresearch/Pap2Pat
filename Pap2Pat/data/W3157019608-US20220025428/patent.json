                        "Archival memory materials are quickly approaching their physical and economic limits. Currently, the most widely used material for this purpose is magnetic tape. Recent advancements in magnetic tape report a two-dimensional areal information density up to 31 Gbit/cm2, though the current commercially available material typically has lower density. New non-volatile memory materials are needed due to the rapid growth of the global datasphere and environmental impacts. DNA may be a viable option to magnetic tape because of its potential for vast information density, significant retention time, and low energy of operation. As a sustainable alternative, in terms of durability, typical magnetic tape lasts for 10-30 years, while double stranded DNA is estimated to be stable for millions of years under optimal environmental conditions.",
                        "Due to advances in synthesizing and sequencing DNA, the cost related to high throughput sequences has greatly dropped. As synthesis and sequencing of DNA becomes cheaper, this has focused the use of DNA as information storage on storing the data within the sequence and relying upon sequences to extract the data later. However, other options may be available.",
                        "DNA nanotechnology has been used to create a variety of one-, two-, and three-dimensional architectures resulting in unprecedented control of both the placement and spacing of nanoparticles, such as dyes, quantum dots, and gold nanoparticles. For example, gold nanoparticles may be attached to DNA bricks or DNA staples or other architectures to place them into lines or other shapes after the architectures self-assemble. However, imaging the nanostructures with sufficient detail to possibly distinguish the individual nanoparticles was not possible until the recent advancements in super-resolution microscopy.",
                        "Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present disclosure to disclose the use of nucleic acid architectures coupled with a dye to be used for nucleic acid memory (NAM). Another aspect of the present disclosure is to further digitize the stored information into digital nucleic acid memory (dNAM). In a further aspect of the present disclosure is to retrieve the data encoded on a nucleic acid architecture and check and correct it for errors prior to decoding the stored information.",

                        "Applicants have created compositions of nucleic acid architectures that may act as optical breadboards with data sites having nanometer spacing. The breadboards self-assemble and may use any type of nucleic acid architectures, such as but not limited to nucleic acid origami or molecular canvas. In an aspect, the staple strands or bricks are arranged at addressable locations that define an indexed array of digital information. These staple strands or bricks are also referred to as data strands. Reading this site-specific localization of digital information is enabled by designing data strands with nucleotides that extend from the architecture. Extended staple strands have two domains: the first domain forms a sequence-specific double helix with the architecture and determines the address of the data; the second domain, which is optional, extends above the architecture and, if present, provides a docking site for a labelled single-stranded DNA imager strand. Binary states of the data sites are defined by the presence (1) or absence (0) of the data domain, which is read with microscopy, such as super resolution (SRM). In another aspect, unique patterns of binary data are encoded by selecting which staple strands have and do not have data domains. As an integrated memory platform, data is entered into dNAM when the data strands encoding 1 or 0 are selected for each addressable site. The data strands are then stored directly, or self-assembled and stored. Editing data is achieved by replacing specific strands or the entire content of a stored structure. To read the data, the origami may be optically imaged below the diffraction limit of light.",
                        "In another aspect, error-correcting algorithms are used to ensure error-free data recovery. Detection of individual nucleotide molecules using SRM is routinely limited by incomplete staple strand incorporation, defective imager strands, fluorophore bleaching, and background fluorescence. In one embodiment, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by averaging multiple images of identical structures. In a more preferred embodiment, encoding and decoding algorithms that combine fountain codes with bi-level, parity-based, and orientation-invariant error detection scheme may be utilized. Fountain codes enable transmission of data over noisy channels. They work by dividing a data file into smaller units called droplets and then sending the droplets at random to a receiver. Droplets can be read in any order and still be decoded to recover the original file, so long as a sufficient number of droplets are sent to ensure that the entire file is received. In an embodiment, each droplet is encoded onto a single origami and additional bits of information are added for error correction to ensure that individual droplets will be recovered, in the presence of high noise, from individual origami. Together, the error correction and fountain codes increase the probability that the message is fully recovered while minimizing the number of nucleotide origami that must be observed. In other embodiments, machine learning algorithms, such as but not limited to, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, or reinforcement learning algorithms may be used for any step or every step of the error correction, encoding, and/or decoding the NAM or dNAM.",

The unique on/off rate will create a location having a value based on the number of unique sequences that could be resolved temporarily at that location, for example, the value could be 0, 1, 2, or more. This unique on/off rate may be observed temporally so data may be encoded onto the architecture both temporally and spatially at the individual dye level. In some embodiments, data density may be further increased using different and/or multiple dyes on the partially complement data and/or imaging strands, where the different and/or multiple dyes have distinct spectra. This allows for special, temporal, and color to act together to further increase the data density of an architecture."

This limited number will depend on the specific encoding algorithm and the amount of data to be stored. For example, a string of bits may be encoded using a fountain code into any number of distinct NAM architectures, a limited number may then be captured using microscopy, and then decoded. However, for a rateless code to properly function, additional information, such as, but not limited to, error correction bit and index bits, needs to be encoded along with the data to ensure that the limited number of possible distinct architectures received provides a reasonable surety, based on the amount of data stored across the population, that the data has been received (FIG. 2A).",

For example, super resolution microscopy (SRM), scanning probe microscopy (SPM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-TEM), or single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. In preferred embodiments, any type of fluoresce SRM may be used, including, but not limited to, 4Pi, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), spatially modulated illumination (SMI), spectral precision distance microscopy (SPDM), binding-activated localization microscopy (BALM), photoactive localization microscopy, points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT), or combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, one or more distinct NAM architectures encoding the data to be processed are placed on a cover slip. Using SRM, the cover slip is first imaged at a high enough resolution to capture the distinct patter of chromophores (FIGS. 2E, 3A-B, 5). In a preferred embodiment, the images are captured using PAINT. For dNAM, each chromophore represents (1) while each dark spot represents a (0). While it may be possible to retrieve all the information from a single architecture, in a preferred embodiment, multiple architectures with the same encoding are imaged and averaged together. The single or averaged image is then processed to extract the sequence of bits (FIG. 6).",
                                "This sequence of bits, if it incorporated error bits, is then checked for errors (FIGS. 6 and 7). FIG. 7 shows an exemplary, preferred error correction flowchart for a single architecture. For example, a priority queue is initialized with an individual architecture, for example a two-dimensional origami, m (the working_matrix). Based on the parity and checksum bits mismatch, the algorithm deduces a set of probable errors and a matrix weight for the working matrix. The matrix weight is proportional to the number of errors, and the main goal of the algorithm is to reduce the matrix weight in a greedy fashion. To that end, each of the probable errors in the working_matrix is sequentially flipped, and a matrix weight calculated for every resulting matrix. The two resulting matrices with the lowest weights are enqueued. The algorithm then replaces the working_matrix with the recalculated matrix possessing the lowest matrix weight from the queue. If the current working matrix already has 9 bits flipped it is discarded and the next matrix in the queue used. The algorithm repeats these steps until the matrix weight equals zero, at this point the data in the origami is considered to have been error-corrected and is passed to the next stage of the decoding (Accept). If the priority queue is emptied before the matrix weight reaches zero, the origami data is considered unrecoverable and is removed from the analysis (Reject).",
                                "After the bit string has been corrected for any errors, the different segments, such as any message bits or index bits, may then be extracted from the sequence (FIG. 6). Once the message bits are separated from the index and other bits, any appropriate decoding algorithm may then be run. In the preferred embodiment, in which the data is encoded using a fountain code, using a logic operator such as, but not limited to, XOR, into a population of distinct architectures or origami, with at least one architecture imaged in a droplet, the droplets are collected (Droplet Table), with each droplet containing one or more file segments. The data in single degree droplets, such as D9 and D8, encode single segments and are used directly to reconstruct the file (Recovered File). To extract additional individual segment data from multi-segment droplets, the decoding algorithm performs a series of XOR operations. The index information allows the algorithm to determine both the degree of the droplet and which segments of the file that the droplet encodes. Taking the case of D2, a series of XOR operations must be performed in order to retrieve additional segment data from it. The decoding algorithm may XOR a multi-degree droplet with another droplet if the other droplet's segment(s) are a proper subset of the multi-degree droplet. For example, the segments contained in D6 are a proper subset of those in D2. After XORing D2 and D6 a new droplet is generated containing segments S5 and S6, which ultimately leads to the algorithm extracting the data for S6. This process is repeated in a greedy fashion until the algorithm retrieves all of the file's segment data (Recovered File), or it runs out of options for XORing droplets (in which case the entire file cannot be successfully recovered). For simplicity, only six of the 15 possible droplets are shown, with the resulting recovered segments depicted in colored boxes (Recovered Segments; FIG. 12).",

During training, input data can be iteratively supplied to a machine-learning model to enable the machine-learning model to identify patterns related to the input data or to identify relationships between the input data and output data. With training, the machine-learning model can be transformed from an untrained state to a trained state. Input data can be split into one or more training sets and one or more validation sets, and the training process may be repeated multiple times. The splitting may follow a k-fold cross-validation rule, a leave-one-out-rule, a leave-p-out rule, or a holdout rule (see U.S. Pat. No. 9,990,367, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).",

                                "As NAM and dNAM may be used to store data onto DNA, it provides several benefits over current methods. In one embodiment, NAM or dNAM may be used for stable, long term storage of data, which may first be encrypted and/or compressed. In a further embodiment, NAM or dNAM may be used as backup data storage. In another embodiment, NAM or dNAM may be used for monitoring supply chains by tagging a product or object to prevent counterfeiting. For example, encoding a block chain tracking purchases, manufactures, warehouses, etc. which could then be validated at any point, for example a spot check, along the supply chain. In other embodiments, because data may be stored on the NAM or dNAM, the data may first be encrypted using an algorithm, and then part of the data strands may be used to tag an object to provide physical encryption. The data strands not being stored with the object would act as a key to unlock the encryption. The nucleic acid architecture for data storage as disclosed herein provides several benefits over current methods.",
                                "Current long-term storage, used for data that includes, but is not limited to, backup or archival data storage, include hard-disk drives, solid state drives, tape storage, and optical storage. While each of these technologies provide different benefits for backup and archival data storage, they also all have drawbacks. These drawbacks include obsolescence, limited life expectancy, limited data capacity/space considerations, waste generation, and the required maintenance.",
                                "For example, most currently available storage options have a limited life expectancy for either the data or the base storage media. Solid state drives tend to lose data over time because as they are used, the passage of electrons through the media can cause leakage. While for hard-disk drives, the magnetism wears off the plates, which can also lead to data loss. This loss requires the drives to be refreshed about every year but will eventually result in failure of the drive. Once a drive wears out it creates electronic waste as it will have to be exposed of. For optical media, rewritable media is unstable compared to the write once media, so there is a balance between creating waste with the write once and have it be available for long-term storage versus being able to refresh the data when needed with the rewritable media. Additionally, the storage media must be kept in dry, climate-controlled rooms to maximize longevity. However, there are already rising concerns about the cooling being used in data centers around the world, including the high energy and water consumption needed. As more data needs to be stored long-term, the energy and water usage will likewise increase and put strains upon available resources.",
                                "Obsolescence is also an issue with current technologies. Due to rapid advances in computer technology, it has led to rapid and hard to predict obsolescence. This poses a problem if the backup or archival media selected falls out from being mainstream as finding ways of reading the now obsolete media or repairing the reader may no longer be readily available, and thus driving up the cost of data storage.",
                                "These issues are circumvented by NAM. Nucleotides, especially those lacking the 2\u2032 hydroxyl group on the sugar like DNA, have a much higher stability, it is easier to store, and offers more flexibility than current long-term storage media. The stability of nucleotides is much longer than the media currently used. For example, DNA has been extracted from natural samples dating back about 700,000 years and then successfully sequenced. Under more optimal circumstances, DNA stability has been estimated to be in the millions of years. This is significantly more stable than any of the current media being used.",
                                "Nucleotides also offer alternate storage capabilities. Current media generally needs to be stored in dry, climate-controlled rooms to prevent damage. Climate-controlled storage generally requires a large amount of energy to run a large air conditioner, which can be a drain on resources and not environmentally friendly. This use of electricity will also increase as more and more data needs to be stored, putting more strain on the use of electricity and the environment. However, given the stability of nucleotides, they may be stored in a variety of environments, including in liquid nitrogen or merely in dry and cool environments. As liquid nitrogen tanks do not require any electricity to keep cold, the storage of nucleotides will cause less of an impact on the environment, providing a surprising benefit over current storage media.",
                                "The use of nucleotides as long-term data storage also provides an additional environmental benefit. Current storage media creates a lot of electronic waste due to its lack of stability. The growing amount of electronic waste in the world is of a growing concern due to not only the amount of waste being generated, but also of the harmful or rare compounds sometimes found inside electronic devices. However, nucleotides and proteins are completely biodegradable, and nucleotides may be refurbished more easily then electronic devices due to their properties, such as Watson Crick pairing. Hence, the use of the nucleic acid architectures and chromophores of the instant disclosure are more environmentally friendly than current storage devices.",
                                "The storage length of the architectures may be further increased by embedding or encapsulating them in a shell to help protect the nucleotides from interacting with the environment. By way of nonlimiting example, the nucleotides to be stored may be impregnated onto filter paper or encapsulated in a biopolymer or silica nanoparticles. Preferably the nucleotides are encapsulated in silica nanoparticles (for example, see Paunescu, D., et al., Reversible DNA encapsulation in silica to produce ROS-resistant and heat-resistant synthetic DNA \u2018fossils\u2019. Nat. Protoc. 8, 2440-2448 (2013), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). This additional protection extends the types of condition that nucleotides remain stable. For example, it has been shown that nucleotides may remain stable for about 2,000 years at ambient temperatures when recovered from being encapsulated in a silicon shell.",
                                "The current disclosure also differs from other nucleotide storage systems, methods, and constructs. Other nucleotide storage systems are akin to the inherent properties of DNA to encode protein information. These systems first assign one or more bases to represent a symbol, such as a binary (1) or (0) or if text A through Z. The systems them encode the data onto one or more strand of nucleotides. To recover the data, the one or more strands are sequenced, and if necessary, assembled and decoded back into the data. Hence, in these systems, the data corresponds directly to the sequence of the strand. However, in this disclosure, the strand sequence is only used to form an architecture and is independent of the data. The positioning of the chromophores in an indexed array is what corresponds to the data being stored.",
                                "The use of a population of strands to create an architecture also permits an added layer of encryption. By distributing the data onto data strands, the data may be physically separated from the other structural strands, for example the scaffold strand in origami or the other staples or bricks that may allow the self-assembly of the full architecture. Hence, without knowing the proper sequence to allow assembly of the architecture, even if all the data strands were known, the data could not be retrieved without the additional structural sequences. Therefore, as both the data may be encrypted and the strands physically separated, the compositions disclosed herein offer both physical and algorithmic encryption.",
                                "Further, given the size of nucleic acids and dyes, the ability to separate the population of strands, the biocompatibility, and the information density of an architecture, the compositions may be miniaturized to such an extent that they may be placed in other various compositions. For example, a portion, such as just the data strands or all the staples, or the entire architecture may be mixed into any product, such as, but not limited to, a pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, paint, glue, powder, food, detergent. The data that may be encoded may include information for tracking the product. More specifically, the data may include the origin, manufacturer, distributor, or recipient of the product.",
                                "The NAM and dNAM may also be used to label products which have met regulatory approval. For example, a product, such as pharmaceutical, pesticide, herbicide, or genetically modified organism, that requires regulatory approval may have a specific regulatory agency's information encoded onto an architecture and then the architecture or the data strands may be included within the product. The type of information that may be stored may include a data string to identify the regulator and any additional information, such as under which regulation, the product was verified. A QR code, blockchain, or an image, similar to a watermark, may also be encoded onto the architecture to identify approval.",
                                "The compositions disclosed herein also differ from the currently used nucleotide strands in what needs to be stored. In current methods, the data is encoded onto the nucleotide string, and then the string is generally included in an expression vector before storage. Hence, current methods store long nucleotide constructs. However, in an embodiment of the current disclosure, only the data strands are stored, wherein the nucleic acid architecture is an origami. In another embodiment, only the data strands comprising a docking domain are stored, wherein the nucleic acid architecture is an origami. As the data strands with the docking domains are what bind to the imager strands, which in turn are bound to the chromophore, and for the cases of origami, the scaffold strand may be known and held constant. Hence, only the data strands which will bind to chromophores need to be stored. However, in other embodiments, all the staple strands are stored, and in yet further embodiments, the scaffold strand and the data strands are stored. Similarly, for the nucleotide brick molecular canvases or single-stranded tiles, all the bricks or tiles may be stored or just those bricks or tiles with a docking domain may be stored. For single stranded oligomers, the oligomer is stored. Therefore, the systems, methods, and compounds disclosed herein differ from other forms of nucleotide storage.",

                                "While the architecture or subsets of the architectures may be used for long term storage, the architectures may also be used for temporary or short-term data storage. For example, due to the heat sensitive nature of base pairing, a fully assembled architecture may be placed into heat sensitive products to detect if the product has been exposed to elevated heat, chemical degradation, or ultra-violet light. The elevated heat or ultra-violet light may cause part or all the architecture to denature and so when imaged, the partially or fully denatured architecture will provide a partial restoration or a blank image. Additionally, this may also be used to identify products that have been sterilized as sterilization will cause the architecture to denature. The degradation of the nucleic acids may also be used to identify the age of a product. If the architecture or part of an architecture is placed within a product and is unprotected, it will degrade. By adding a sufficiently large quantity of an architecture or a part of an architecture, the degradation may be used to correspond to a use by or best by date. Further, as the different sugars that make up the nucleotides, for example ribose or deoxyribose, degrade at different rates, architectures storing the same information but having different sugars may be designed to degrade a certain amount of one architecture before a second having a different sugar.",
                                "Additional modification to the sugars, such as by adding or removing reactive groups or by locking or bridging the sugar may also affect the degradation of the nucleotides. For example, LNA and BNA increase duplex stability, which would increase the denaturing temperature, and protect the nucleotides from nucleases. Conversely, UNA decreases duplex stability allowing for lower denaturing temperatures of an architecture.",
                                "Therefore, by altering the sugar of the nucleotides it is possible to tune the stability of either specific regions of the architecture or the entire architecture, allowing for its use not only for long term, stable storage, but also for short term, temporary storage and identification.",

                                "We report digital Nucleic Acid Memory (dNAM), a novel approach to DNA-based data storage. In dNAM, data is encoded by selecting specific combinations of single-stranded DNA possessing (1) or lacking (0) docking site domains. When combined with scaffold DNA these staple strands form DNA-origami optical breadboards from which data is read by monitoring binding of fluorescent imager probes using DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy. To enhance data retention, we created a multi-layer error correction scheme that combines fountain codes with bi-level parity codes. As a prototype, 15 origami were encoded with \u2018Data is in our DNA!\\n\u2019, with each origami encoding a unique data droplet. Our error-correction algorithms ensured that we recovered 100% of the message even when individual docking sites, or entire origami, were missing. Unlike other DNA-based data storage systems, reading dNAM does not require sequencing. As such, it offers a new pathway to harness the advantages of DNA as an emerging memory material.",
                                "**Introduction**",
                                "As outlined by the Semiconductor Research Corporation, archival memory materials are quickly approaching their physical and economic limits1,2. Motivated by the rapid growth of the global datasphere3, and its environmental impacts, new non-volatile memory materials are needed. As a sustainable alternative, DNA is a viable option because of its vast information density, significant retention time, and low energy of operation4. While synthesis and sequencing cost curves drive innovations in the field5, divergent approaches to nucleic acid memory (NAM) have been limited by the focus on using sequencing to recover stored digital information6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.",
                                "Here, we report an alternative approach to DNA memory via the creation of digital nucleic acid memory (dNAM)\u2014which is inspired by innovations in DNA nanotechnology15 and made possible by recent advancements in super-resolution microscopy (SRM)16. In dNAM, non-volatile information is digitally encoded into specific combinations of single-stranded DNA, commonly known as staple strands, that can form DNA origami nanostructures when combined with a scaffold strand. When formed into DNA origami, the staple strands are arranged at addressable locations (FIGS. 1A-1C) that define an indexed array of digital information. This site-specific localization of digital information is enabled by designing staple strands with nucleotides that extend from the origami. Extended staple strands have two domains: the first domain forms a sequence-specific double helix with the scaffold and determines the address of the data within the origami; the second domain extends above the origami and, if present, provides a docking site for fluorescently labelled single-stranded DNA imager strands. Binary states are defined by the presence (1) or absence (0) of the data domain, which is read with a super-resolution microscopy technique called DNA-Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT)17. Unique patterns of binary data are encoded by selecting which staple strands have and do not have data domains. As an integrated memory platform, data is entered into dNAM when the staple strands encoding 1 or 0 are selected for each addressable site. The staple strands are then stored directly, or self-assembled into DNA-origami and stored. Editing data is achieved by replacing specific strands or the entire content of a stored structure. To read the data, the origami are optically imaged below the diffraction limit of light using DNA-PAINT (FIGS. 4A-4D).",
                                "Key design features of dNAM, that ensure error-free data recovery, are our error-correcting algorithms. Detection of individual DNA molecules using DNA-PAINT is routinely limited by incomplete staple strand incorporation, defective imager strands, fluorophore bleaching, and background fluorescence18. Although it is possible to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by averaging multiple images of identical structures18, this approach comes at a significant cost to the read speed and information density. To overcome these challenges, we created dNAM-specific information encoding and decoding algorithms that combine fountain codes with a custom, bi-level, parity-based, and orientation-invariant error detection scheme. Fountain codes enable transmission of data over noisy channels19. They work by dividing a data file into smaller units called droplets and then sending the droplets at random to a receiver. Droplets can be read in any order and still be decoded to recover the original file20, so long as a sufficient number of droplets are sent to ensure that the entire file is received. We encode each droplet onto a single origami and add additional bits of information for error correction to ensure that individual droplets will be recovered, in the presence of high noise, from individual origami. Together, the error correction and fountain codes increase the probability that the message is fully recovered while minimizing the number of DNA origami that must be observed.",

As a proof of concept, we encoded the message \u2018Data is in our DNA!\\n\u2019 into origami and recovered the message using DNA-PAINT. We divided the message into 15 digital droplets, each encoded by a separately synthesized origami with addressable staple strands that space data domains approximately 10 nm apart. A single DNA-PAINT recording recovered the message from 20 femtomoles of origami, with approximately 750 origami needing to be read to reach a 100% probability of full data retrieval. By combining the spatial control of DNA nanotechnology with our error correction algorithms, we demonstrate dNAM as a massively parallel optical technology for archival memory applications.",

                                "To test our dNAM concept, we encoded the message \u2018Data is in our DNA!\\n\u2019 into 15 distinct DNA-origami nanostructures (FIG. 1A). Each origami was designed with a unique 6\u00d78 data matrix that was generated by our encoding algorithm with data domains positioned \u02dc10 nm apart. For encoding purposes, the message was converted to binary code (ASCII) and then segmented into 15 overlapping data droplets that were each 16 bits. Inspired in part by digital encoding formats like QR-codes, the 48 addressable sites on each origami were used to encode one of the 16-bit data droplets, as well as information used to ensure the recovery of each data droplet. Specifically, each origami was designed to contain a 4-bit binary index (0000 -1110), twenty bits for parity checks, four bits for checksums, and four bits allocated as orientation markers (FIG. 1B). To fully recover the encoded message, we synthesized each origami separately, deposited an approximately equal mixture of all 15 designs (\u02dc20 femtomoles of total origami) onto a glass coverslip, and recorded 40,000 frames from a single field of view using DNA-PAINT (\u02dc4500 origami identified in 2,982 \u03bcm2). Super-resolution images of the hybridized imager strands were reconstructed from signal blinks identified in the recording to map the positions of the data domains on each origami (FIG. 1C). Using a custom localization processing algorithm, the signals were translated to a 6\u00d78 grid and converted back to a 48-bit binary string\u2014which was passed to the decoding algorithm for error correction, droplet recovery, and message reconstruction. The process enabled successful recovery of the dNAM encoded message from a single super-resolution recording.",

                                "We evaluated all of the origami structures in order to confirm that the 15 different designs were successfully synthesized, with data domains in the intended addresses. Automated image processing algorithms were developed to identify, orient and average multiple images of each origami from the DNA-PAINT recording of the mixture (FIGS. 3A-3B). Although the edges of origami were more sensitive to data strand insertion failures (FIGS. 8A-8C), the results confirmed that all of the data domains, in each of the origami designs, were detectable in each of three separate experiments. Each individual origami synthesis was visualized and validated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images further confirmed that the general shapes of all 15 origami designs were as expected with properly positioned data domains (FIG. 5). The results indicate that the extended staple strands do not substantially inhibit the synthesis of the 15 unique origami designs.",
                                "Further AFM Analysis of dNAM Origami",
                                "As an additional quality control step, we also used AFM to examine origami deposited onto a glass coverslip immediately following SRM imaging. We were not able to resolve individual docking sites in these images, most likely due to the increased roughness of glass, as compared to mica. However, it was possible to count the number of origami in a field of view for comparison with SRM. The densities of origami estimated from the images were 2.4 and 1.4 origami/\u03bcm2 for AFM and SRM respectively, suggesting that \u02dc60% of the total origami deposited have their docking sites facing away from the coverslip and available for imager strand binding. To further investigate the variance in error rates between origami designs, we resynthesized the most error prone origami (origami-2). DNA-PAINT imaging indicated that the fresh original batch showed 9.7\u00b12 false negative errors per origami, consistent with the original experiment, while the second batch showed 7.1\u00b12 false negative errors. This suggests that at least a portion of the variance in error rates is independent of origami design and may be caused by variations in mixing, folding, and purification conditions.",

                                "Our encoding approach added 24 error-correction bits of data to every origami structure so that data droplets can be determined from individual origami even when data domains are incorrectly resolved, and the entire message recovered if some droplets are missed entirely. To evaluate the performance of the decoding algorithm, we examined the frequency and types of errors in the DNA-PAINT images and the effect of these errors on our decoding outcomes. We used a template matching strategy where each of the 15 origami grid designs were considered a template, and each individual origami in the field of view was compared to these designs to find a best match. We identified the total number of origami that matched, or did not match, each design (FIGS. 9A-9B). We then determined the number of each design identified by the decoding algorithm when recovering the message (FIG. 9C)\u2014a process independent of template matching and blind to the droplet data contained in the DNA origami. We observed a clear negative correlation between the number of errors detected in a specific design and the number of corresponding data droplets that were successfully decoded by the algorithm (FIG. 9D). The results indicate that, even though there was a low relative abundance of several origami in the deposition mixture (particularly origami-2) and a mean false negative rate of 7.3\u00b11.2% across the different designs, our error-correction scheme enabled successful message recovery. False positives were much less common in our experiments, with a mean of 1.7\u00b10.5% (FIG. 9B). Furthermore, the mean number of errors overcome by the decoding algorithm (5.5\u00b10.1) was lower than the mean number of errors observed across all the origami (7.7\u00b10.1), demonstrating the challenge of decoding origami when several fluorescent signals are missing (FIG. 9E). Nevertheless, the ability of our data encoding and decoding strategy to recover the message despite errors in individual origami is very promising, and the results provide useful guidelines for evaluating and optimizing origami performance for future dNAM designs.",

                                "Given the observed frequency of missing data points, we used a random sampling approach to determine the number of origami needed to decode the \u2018Data is in our DNA!\\n\u2019 message under our experimental conditions. We started with all the decoded binary output strings that were obtained from the single-field-of-view recordings and took random subsamples of 50-3000 binary strings. We passed each random subsample of strings through the decoding algorithm and determined the number of droplets that were recovered (FIG. 10). Based on the algorithmic settings used in the experiment, we found that only \u02dc750 successfully decoded origami were needed to recover the message with near 100% probability. This number is largely driven by the presence of origami in our sample that were prone to high error rates and thus rarely decoded correctly (i.e., origami-2).",
                                "Simulations of dNAM",
                                "Simulations were run to determine the size efficiency of the encoding scheme, as well as its ability to recover from errors. As shown in FIG. 11A, the number of origami required to encode a message of length n increases roughly at a linear rate up to n=5000 bytes of data. Larger message sizes require more bits to be devoted to indexing, decreasing the number of available data bits per origami, creating a practical limit of 64 kilobytes of data for the prototype described in this work. This limit can be increased, however, by increasing the number of bits per origami. To determine the ability of the decoding and error correction algorithm to recover information in the presence of increasing error rates, in silico origami that encoded randomly generated data, were subjected to increasing bit error rates. The decoding algorithm robustly recovers the entire message for all tested message sizes when the average number of errors per origami is less than 7.4 (FIG. 11B). At 7.4 errors per origami, the message recovery rate drops to 97.5%, and as expected decreases rapidly with higher error rates (55% recovery at 8.2 errors per origami, and 7.5% at 9 errors per origami). An important feature of our algorithm is that the origami recovery rate can be very low (as low as 63%) and still recover the entire message 100% of the time.",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "Our results demonstrate a proof of concept for writing, editing, storing and reading of digital information encoded in DNA origami structures. Because of the durability of DNA, dNAM is well suited for archival information storage. Currently, the most widely used material for this purpose is magnetic tape. Recent advancements in magnetic tape report a two-dimensional areal information density up to 31 Gbit/cm2,21 though the current commercially available material typically has lower density9. Although relevant only for reading throughput, not storage, the information density of tape can be compared to the dNAM origami, which contain data domains spaced at 10 nm intervals to achieve an areal density of about 1000 Gbit/cm2. Even after accounting for using \u02dc2/3 of the bits for indexing and error correction, this still results in an areal data density of 330 Gbit/cm2. It is possible to increase dNAM areal density by placing a data domain at every turn in the DNA helix (\u02dc3.5 nm spacing), a distance that has been resolved by SRM22. Other avenues to increasing density are also available, such as previously reported multiplexing techniques with multiple fluorophores and orthogonal binding sequences with different binding kinetics33, and incorporation of each of these approaches is expected to impact reading throughput. In terms of durability, typical magnetic tape lasts for 10-30 years, while double stranded DNA is estimated to be stable for millions of years under optimal environmental conditions8.",
                                "With our current microscope setup and origami deposition protocol we can image the 7,500 unique origami designs needed to store 5 kB of data (FIG. 5), albeit in several recordings. We conservatively estimate it would take \u02dc30 recordings to ensure a 100% probability of successful data recovery given the error rates we observed. While it is possible to use dNAM, as described here, to store up to 64 kB the number of origami designs required to meet the increased indexing demands make this impractical. To efficiently handle larger datasets, it is necessary to improve the indexing capacity of individual origami. This could be achieved by engineering larger origami or by simply increasing data density\u2014either by placing data sites closer together or by using multiplexing techniques to augment bit depth at each site. Improvements in read speed could be achieved by depositing origami at higher concentrations, making simultaneous recordings, and by optimizing dNAM to work with shorter, faster binding, imager strands. Our previous work24 shows close-packing of origami is possible on boron-implanted silicon substrates, demonstrating a potential route forward for reducing reading times.",
                                "Our results also indicate that advancements in origami-based information storage and reading will require a coordinated effort between improvements in origami synthesis, substrate deposition, DNA-PAINT, and coding algorithms. For example, our subsampling approach (FIG. 10) showed that a decoding algorithm that corrected up to nine errors easily recovered our entire message, while algorithms that corrected only five or fewer errors are much less computationally expensive but rarely recovered our full message. This makes sense, given that most of the origami detected had more than five errors (FIG. 9E). We anticipate that reducing the number of errors by improving origami design and/or imager strand performance would allow more efficient algorithms for data recovery, which would in turn decrease the number of bits dedicated to error correction and thus increase information density.",
                                "Our fountain code algorithm is exceedingly robust to randomly lost packets of information, as long as the receiver receives K+\u00a3 packets, where K is the minimum number of packets required to encode the file under perfect conditions (i.e., K is equal to the file size) and is the number of additional packets received. The probability of being able to decode the file is then (1\u2212\u03b4), where \u03b4 is upper-bounded by 2{circumflex over (\u2003)}(\u2212K\u03b5).25 This equation implies that all things being equal, the larger the file size the greater the likelihood of successfully recovering the file at the receiver. Normally, the transmitter continues to transmit droplets in a fountain code until the receiver acknowledges successful file recovery. In the case of dNAM, this is not possible since the number of droplets must be fixed ahead of time to equal the number of origami. Reducing the error rates, or improving error correction/detection, would have the added benefit of reducing the number of droplets and hence origami discarded by the fountain code. These improvements would make it easier to determine the minimum number of droplets/origami needed to ensure robust file recovery while increasing information density even further.",
                                "The lower abundance and higher error rate of origami-2 (FIG. 9) indicates that some designs have defects that we could not detect by AFM or SRM alone. Careful defect analysis indicates that incorporated but inactive data domains play a greater role in producing errors than unincorporated staple strands26. Future dNAM research should focus on sequence optimization to minimize variation in hybridization rates and the formation of off-target structures27. It should also include the use of larger DNA origami and increased bit depth through multiplexing.",
                                "**Conclusion**",
                                "DNA is an emerging material for data storage due to its high information density, high durability, low energy of operation, and the declining costs of synthesis1. The traditional approach in the field is to design and synthesize unique oligos that encode data directly into their sequence. This data is recovered by reading the pool of oligos using sequencing. In contrast, dNAM takes advantage of another property of DNA\u2014its programmability. By encoding binary data into DNA origami and reading it as spatially and temporally distinct hybridization events, dNAM decouples information recovery from sequencing. Editing the data is trivial through the inclusion or exclusion of sequence extensions from a library of staple strands. Data strands can be stored directly or incorporated into origami and then stored; separating the 3D storage density from the 2D reading density. In addition, dNAM is a massively parallel process because the large optical field of view affords tens of thousands of origami to be imaged simultaneously, and the number of optical read heads is proportional to the concentration of the imager strands. Rather than averaging thousands of DNA-PAINT images together, to resolve the digital data\u2033, individual origami were read here using custom encoding, decoding, and error-correction algorithms. Our algorithms combined fountain codes with bi-level parity codes to significantly enhance our data retention\u2014creating a multi-layer error correction scheme that encoded index, orientation, parity, and checksum bits into the origami. As a proof of concept, several bytes of data were recovered in a single DNA-PAINT recording. Even when the DNA origami recovery rate was poor (as low as 63%) the message was recovered 100% of the time. As a technology platform, dNAM offers a new pathway to harnessing the advantages of DNA as a material for information storage."

These messages were then divided into m/b equally sized segments, where b is the number of data bits to be encoded onto an individual origami. For fixed-size origami, larger messages necessitated a smaller b, as more bits had to be dedicated to the index. In these cases, b varied between eight (for m=12,800) and twelve (for m=160). After determining message segments, droplets were formed using the fountain code algorithm and encoded onto origami, along with the corresponding index, orientation, and error-correcting bits. Ten in silico copies of each unique origami were created, and 0-9 bits flipped at random to introduce errors. The origami were decoded as described above."

There is a correlation between a higher number of 1-bits and a higher number of false negatives, as would be expected, but this does not explain most of the observed variance between origami. The phenomenon of higher errors near the edges of the origami has been observed previously3 and was interpreted as reflecting a difference in staple strand incorporation efficiencies. To investigate this and other sources of potential sources of error in our array designs, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging on individual origami deposited on mica (FIG. 5). From the averaged SRM images in FIG. 3, it can be seen that every data strand was recorded at least once for all expected positions in all arrays. This suggests that there were no systematic failures in strand incorporation or data strand binding domains. This is further substantiated by the AFM images, in which origami were typically both well formed (lacking holes and having the expected dimensions) and appeared to have incorporated the majority of their data strands. Although it was possible to resolve the majority of data strands positions (FIG. 5), a strict analysis on missing data strands using AFM would not be completely reliable since tip-sample interactions could easily promote strand compression and displacement. However, our previous correlative defect analysis of DNA origami, combining AFM and DNA-PAINT, indicated that strand incorporation plays a role in origami site yields and defects are likely due to the unavailability of incorporated staple strands. Further, DNA-PAINT itself may locally increase the susceptibility of DNA origami to damage during imaging4. This is in keeping with our results and suggests that further optimization of the DNA-PAINT imaging protocol will help reduce the false negative error rate."
