    "abstract": "Quantification of nonlinear interactions between two nonstationary signals presents a computational challenge in different research fields, especially for assessments of physiological systems. Traditional approaches that are based on theories of stationary signals cannot resolve nonstationarity-related issues and, thus, cannot reliably assess nonlinear interactions in physiological systems. In this review we discuss a new technique called multimodal pressure flow (MMPF) method that utilizes Hilbert-Huang transformation to quantify interaction between nonstationary cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood pressure (BP) for the assessment of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA). CA is an important mechanism responsible for controlling cerebral blood flow in responses to fluctuations in systemic BP within a few heart-beats. The MMPF analysis decomposes BP and BFV signals into multiple empirical modes adaptively so that the fluctuations caused by a specific physiologic process can be represented in a corresponding empirical mode. Using this technique, we showed that dynamic CA can be characterized by specific phase delays between the decomposed BP and BFV oscillations, and that the phase shifts are significantly reduced in hypertensive, diabetics and stroke subjects with impaired CA. Additionally, the new technique can reliably assess CA using both induced BP/BFV oscillations during clinical tests and spontaneous BP/BFV fluctuations during resting conditions.",

                "Previous works have demonstrated that fluctuations in physiological signals carry important information reflecting the mechanisms underlying control processes and interactions among organ systems at multiple time scales. A major problem in the analysis of physiological signals is related to nonstationarities (statistical properties such as mean and standard deviation vary with time), which is an intrinsic feature of physiological data and persists even without external stimulation [1][2][3]. The presence of nonstationarities makes traditional approaches assuming stationary signals not reliable. To resolve the difficulties related to nonstationary behavior, concepts and methods derived from statistical physics have been applied in the studies of different control mechanisms including locomotion control [4][5][6], cardiac regulation [7,8], cardio-respiratory coupling [9][10][11], renal vascular autoregulation [12], cerebral blood flow regulation [13][14][15][16], and circadian rhythms [17][18][19]. One of the innovative approaches applied to physiological studies is Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) [20]. The HHT is based on nonlinear chaotic theories and has been designed to extract dynamic information from nonstationary signals at different time scales. The advantages of the HHT over traditional Fourier-based methods have been appreciated in many studies of different physiological systems such as blood pressure hemodynamics [21], cerebral autoregulation [13,15,16], cardiac dynamics [22], respiratory dynamics [23], and electroencephalographic activity [24]. In this review, we focus on the computational challenge on the quantification of interactions between two nonstationary physiologic signals. To demonstrate progress in resolving the generic problem related to nonstationarities, we review the recent applications of nonlinear dynamic approaches based on HHT to one specific physiological control mechanismcerebral blood flow regulation.",
                "Cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms are engaged to compensate for metabolic demands and perfusion pressure variations under physiologic and pathologic conditions [25,26]. Dynamic autoregulation reflects the ability of the cerebral microvasculature to control perfusion by adjusting the small-vessel resistances in response to beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) fluctuations by involving myogenic and neurogenic regulation. Reliable and noninvasive assessment of cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a major challenge in medical diagnostics. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) enables assessment of dynamic CA during interventions with sudden systemic BP changes induced by the Valsalva maneuver (VM), head-up tilt, and sit-to-stand test in various medical conditions [13,[26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. Conventional approaches typically model cerebral regulation using mathematical models of a linear and time-invariant system to simulate the dynamics of BP as an input to the system, and cerebral blood flow as output. A transfer function is typically used to explore the relationship between BP and cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV) by calculating gain and phase shift between the BP and BFV power spectra [26,[35][36][37][38][39][40]. Many studies have shown that transfer function can identify alterations in BP-BFV relationship under pathologic conditions such as stroke, hypertension, and traumatic brain injuries that are associated with impaired autoregulation [26,[35][36][37][38][39][41][42][43]. This Fourier transform-based approach, however, assumed that signals are composed of superimposed sinusoidal oscillations of constant amplitude and period at a predetermined frequency range. This assumption puts an unavoidable limitation on the reliability and application of the method, because BP and BFV signals recorded in clinical settings are often nonstationary and are modulated by nonlinearly interacting processes at multiple time-scales corresponding to the beat-to-beat systolic pressure, respiration, spontaneous BP fluctuations, and those induced by interventions.",
                "To overcome problems in CA evaluations related to nonstationarity and nonlinearity, several approaches derived from concepts and methods of nonlinear dynamics have been proposed [13][14][15][16][44][45][46][47]. A novel computational method called multimodal pressure-flow (MMPF) analysis was recently developed to study the BP-BFV relationship during the Valsalva maneuver (VM) [13]. The MMPF method enables evaluation of autoregulatory dynamics based on instantaneous phase analysis of BP and BFV oscillations induced by the intervention (a sudden reduction of BP and BFV followed by an increase in both signals). The MMPF applies an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm to decompose complex BP and BFV signals into multiple empirical modes [21]. Each mode represents a frequency-amplitude modulation in a narrow frequency band that can be related to a specific physiologic process. For example, this technique can easily identify BP and BFV oscillations induced by the VM (0.1-0.03 Hz, i.e., period \u223c10 to 30 seconds). Using this method, a characteristic phase lag between BFV and BP fluctuations corresponding to VM was found in healthy subjects, and this phase lag was reduced in patients with hypertension and stroke [13]. These findings suggested that BFV-BP phase lag could serve as an index of CA. However, intervention procedures, such as the VM, introduce large intracranial pressure fluctuations and also require patients' active participation. As a result, such procedures are not applicable under various clinical conditions, such as in acute care settings.",
                "It has been hypothesized that CA can be evaluated from spontaneous BP-BFV fluctuations during resting conditions [14][15][16]. This hypothesis has been motivated by the facts that (i) CA is a continuous dynamic process so that it should always engage to regulate cerebral blood flow, and (ii) BP and BFV display spontaneous fluctuations at different time scales [38,39,[48][49][50] even during resting conditions. Since spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations can be entrained by respiration or other external perturbation over a wide frequency range [0.05-0.4 Hz] [51,52] and the dominant frequency of spontaneous BP fluctuations varies among individuals over time and under different test conditions, reliable measures of the nonlinear BFV-BP relationship without preassuming oscillation frequencies and waveform shapes are needed. These requirements are well satisfied by the MMPF algorithm which extracts intrinsic BP and BFV oscillations embedded in the original signals and quantifies instantaneous phase relationship between them. If the MMPF is sensitive and can provide reliable estimation of autoregulation using spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations, it is expected that, similar to BP and BFV oscillations introduced by the VM, spontaneous BFV and BP oscillations during resting conditions should also exhibit specific phase shifts.",
                "In this review, we present an overview of the transfer function analysis (TFA) that was traditionally used to quantify CA (Section 2) and of the MMPF method and its modifications (Section 3). In Section 4, we introduce a newly developed automatic algorithm for the improved MMPF method as well as engineering aspects that will potentially lead to a fully automated analysis without expert input. In Section 5, we review previous applications of MMPF in clinical studies [15,16], in which the ability and reliability of the method in assessing the CA from spontaneous BP-BFV fluctuations during resting conditions were evaluated (Section 5). Specifically, we discuss the MMPF results in three pathological conditions that are associated with cardiovascular complications affecting cerebrovascular control systems (stroke, hypertension, and diabetes) [53][54][55][56][57]. Our previous studies have shown altered CA in these conditions [13,15,16]. Additionally, a comparison of the MMPF and the TFA results in the study of type 2 diabetes was discussed. In Section 6, we discuss why nonlinear dynamic approaches such as the MMPF can more reliably quantify nonlinear relationship between nonstationary signals."

Thus, each component obtained from the EEMD may better represent fluctuations corresponding to a specific physiologic process.

Such nonstationary oscillations can be better characterized by analytical methods that can quantify the amplitude and phase (or frequency) at any given moment. Therefore, the MMPF uses Hilbert transform to obtain instantaneous phases of BP and BFV oscillation. Unlike the Fourier transform, Hilbert transform does not assume that signals are composed of superimposed sinusoidal oscillations with constant amplitude and frequency.

The manual selection is useful, but it requires fully understanding the MMPF algorithm and all technical details of the program execution. Moreover, the manual selection needs human inputs and it is time consuming. Therefore, the best solution would be to enable a program-based automatic selection according to the defined criteria for mode selection, described in Section 3.3. As a first step to achieve this goal, we have designed a computer-assisted program to select the respiratorymodulated oscillation from the decomposed IMF modes. In this program, the STFT spectrogram analysis, a wellknown method of time frequency analysis, is performed for all decomposed modes (right panel of Figures 2 and3).

                        "Quantification of nonlinear interactions between two nonstationary signals presents a computational challenge in different research fields, especially for assessments of physiological systems. The computational approaches, based on traditional theories and methods, cannot resolve nonstationarityrelated issues and be used reliably to study these systems. One possible and promising approach is to utilize and adopt concepts and methods derived from nonlinear dynamics that are designed to explore nonlinear interactions in nonstationary systems. In the last two decades, nonlinear dynamic approaches have been applied in many different biological fields such as cardiovascular system, respiration, locomotor activity, and neuronal activity in brain [11,14,62,63]. It has been gradually accepted that nonlinear dynamic methods can provide new information about the control mechanisms of physiological systems that may be difficult to be characterized using traditional approaches. In this review, we aim to demonstrate the point by discussing recent advance in the field of cerebral blood flow regulation and the contribution of a nonlinear dynamic approach as  represented by the multimodal pressure flow method (as discussed in the following sections). Though the MMPF method has been mainly applied to assess the cerebral autoregulation, the concept of this approach is generally applicable for other physiological controls that involve interactions between two nonstationary signals. Designing and improving these approaches are crucial to tackle the generic problem related to nonstationarity."

                        "Autoregulatory responses are assessed by challenging cerebrovascular systems using interventions such as the VM, thigh cuff deflation, and the head-up tilt [26][27][28][29][30][31]64]. However, these intervention procedures may introduce large intracranial pressure fluctuations and require patients' active cooperation. Therefore, they are not generally applicable in acute care clinical settings. In recent studies, an improved MMPF method was introduced to quantify the BP-BFV relationship in healthy, hypertensive, and stroke subjects during supine resting conditions [15]. The results support the notion that autoregulation is a dynamic process and is always engaged even during resting conditions. Dynamic autoregulation is needed for continuous adjustment of cerebral perfusion in response to variations of autonomic cardiovascular and respiratory control (e.g., respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, vascular tone). Furthermore, applying the method to healthy and diabetic subjects, we showed that cerebral vasoregulatory processes that control pressure-flow relationship can operate at shorter time-scales (<10 seconds) than previously suggested (see Figure 6). In this review, we also introduced new results that present a significant improvement of MMPF method by introducing an automated mode selection algorithm that is based on time-frequency analysis. This approach allows objective mode selection based on time-frequency measures. Thus, the MMPF software is now more user-friendly and does not require computational knowledge to implement the MMPF technique for clinical evaluations. Unlike traditional Fourier transform based approaches, the MMPF method does not assume the BP and BFV as superimposed sinusoidal oscillations of constant amplitude and period at a preset frequency range. Instead, the method adopts a new adaptive signal processing algorithm, EEMD, to extract dominant spontaneous oscillations that are actually embedded in the BP and BFV fluctuations. Since spontaneous oscillations that are related to a specific physiology process are usually nonstationary (i.e., statistical properties such as mean levels and oscillation period vary over time and change for different subjects), the conventional filters that are based on Fourier or wavelet theories are not reliable or valid for the extraction of embedded spontaneous oscillation from the BP and BFV signals. In this paper, we demonstrated that the EEMD can accurately extract oscillations associated with respirations from nonstationary BP and BFV signals. This result indicates that the EEMD can serve as a blind time-variant filter to extract the embedded nonstationary oscillations adaptively. Studying spontaneous BP and BFV oscillations extracted by the EEMD method revealed advanced phases in BFV compared to those in BP, that is, flow oscillations preceded systemic pressure oscillations. These BP-BFV phase shifts were similar to those observed during the VM at the BP minimum and maximum [13]. Such positive phase shift has also been reported using Fourier transform methods during head-up tilt and is interpreted as the faster recovery of BFV caused by the compensation of cerebral vasoregulation [30]. In our  study, we showed that BP-BFV phase shifts of spontaneous oscillation for hypertensive stroke subjects were significantly reduced when compared to healthy subjects as shown by previous studies during the VM [13]. Therefore, the BP-BFV phase shifts derived from the spontaneous oscillations can also be used as the indicator of dynamic CA."

                        "It has been proposed that autoregulatory mechanisms act as a high-pass filter-cybernetic model [35,37], being more active at lower frequencies (< 0.1 Hz) and less effective for faster spontaneous fluctuations and at respiration frequency. Though there is no established physiologic neural pathway that can account for the high-pass filter mechanism, the frequency dependent influence of CA has been supported by many studies that are based on the transfer function analysis [39,40,42,65]. It is important to note that coherence, gain, and phase of transfer function are continuous functions of frequency and do not exhibit an apparent transition point at a specific frequency. Thus, the frequency-dependent influence of CA, as suggested by the model and transfer function results, does not indicate a cutoff frequency beyond which CA has no influence on blood flow regulation. Nevertheless, many studies used \u223c0.1 Hz as an upper frequency boundary for the transfer function analysis; such choice of frequency range for the estimation of CA seems rather arbitrary. Since previous studies showed that blood flow level after induced sudden blood reduction can be restored within 3-6 seconds (corresponding to 0.16-0.33 Hz in frequency domain) [66,67], there is no reason to refute that CA can modulate the relationship of BP and BFV at frequencies faster than 0.1 Hz. Indeed, there were already studies indicating that BP and BFV oscillations at frequencies faster than 0.1 Hz may also provide useful information on CA [14,68]. Moreover, the transfer function analysis is based on Fourier transform that implicitly assumes stationary signals composed of sinusoidal oscillations of constant amplitude and period. However, real-world recordings, such as BP and BFV signals, are usually nonstationary and exhibit dynamic changes over time (e.g., shifts of respiratory frequencies, occurrence of spontaneous waves, etc.). Therefore, a single transfer function may not be sensitive enough to identify the influences of CA on relationship between the BP and BFV oscillations at all time scales.",
                        "It is intriguing that the MMPF analysis revealed a specific phase shift between BP and BFV oscillation in the frequency range of \u223c0. 1-0.4 Hz in control subjects, and this phase shift was significantly reduced in diabetic subjects. These findings strongly support that CA is a continuous dynamic process, influencing BP-BFV relationship over a frequency range (>0.1 Hz) that is beyond previously ranges recognized. However, transfer function analysis could not identify this alteration in BP-BFV phase relationship in diabetic subjects in this frequency range, suggesting that inherent nonlinearities of CA may be better described by nonlinear methods such as the MMPF and multivariate coherence-an approach that takes into account contributions of other inputs, for example, pressure and cerebrovascular resistances [46]."

                        "The observation that transfer function analysis (TFA) cannot, but the MMPF can, show difference in phase relation between systemic BP and BFV in type 2 diabetes, may lead to following explanations: (1) TFA quantifies pressure and flow relationship in a specific frequency range, while MMPF is not frequency dependent. Therefore, these two methods may quantify different aspects of underlying mechanisms responsible for blood flow regulation. (2) Sensitivities of these two methods are different so that their performances in a small sample size of subjects can be different. As shown by previous studies, both TFA and MMPF can identify alterations in blood flow regulation in pathologic conditions such as stroke, hypertension, and traumatic brain injuries that are associated with impaired autoregulation. These findings indicate that both methods can quantify CA using BP and cerebral BFV but do not explain different results in diabetic patients. The second possibility comes from the fact that TFA usually focuses on the frequencies below 0.1 Hz while MMPF does not assume frequency range, that is, MMPF extracted dominant oscillations that are truly embedded in data. Thus, the optimal frequency range to distinguish the difference between controls and diabetics in blood pressure and blood flow relationship is not known. In this study, we found that there were no group differences Figure 7: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the DM prediction using BP-BFV phase shifts obtained from the MMPF method and using transfer function phases (0.1-0.4 Hz) (adapted from [16]). The y-axis is the sensitivity, representing the percentage of DM subjects identified; and the x-axis is 1-specificity; that is, the percentage of control subjects that are incorrectly identified as DM subjects. The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) closer to 1.0 for BP-BFV phase shifts indicates that the MMPF measure serve as a better discriminator between the control and DM groups than traditional transfer function analysis. in TFA results in the frequency range 0.01-0.07 Hz (in which CA was traditionally believed to affect pressure and flow relationship). The frequency of dominant oscillations in blood pressure and flow extracted by MMPF was from 0.1 to 0.4 Hz. However, BP-BFV phase obtained from TFA for the frequency range 0.1-0.4 Hz showed no difference between controls and diabetic subjects, either (see Table 1). This finding refutes the notion that the differences in results detected by TFA and MMPF are merely due to differences in frequency range. Therefore, the differences in sensitivity of both methods offer explanation for discrepancy in the CA estimates in diabetic patients. Consistently, we found that the BP-BFV phase shift had a better performance in discriminating between control subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes (see Figure 7). The different results obtained from the two analyses may not be surprising because the BP-BFV phase shifts of transfer function analysis are based on the Fourier transform which is not applicable to nonstationary BP and BFV signals and nonlinear BP-BFV relationship. Comparisons of the MMPF and the TFA performance were done only using data obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes. It would be desirable to further establish reliability and repeatability of these methods in other pathological conditions that are known to impair cerebral autoregulation.",
                        "This review was focused on the MMPF method. There are other approaches from nonlinear dynamics such as phase synchronization technique [14], multiple multivariate coherence [46], and general Volterra-Wiener approaches [44,45,47] that have been used to quantify cerebral autoregulation but could not be covered in this short review. More systematic studies are necessary to evaluate advantages and disadvantages of these innovative methods during different physiological and pathological conditions.",
                        "In conclusion, CA dynamics can be reliably estimated from spontaneous BP and BFV fluctuations during baseline resting conditions, and the BFV-BP phase shift obtained by the improved MMPF method is a sensitive and reliable measure of blood flow regulation and can be potentially used to monitor autoregulation in subjects with cerebromicrovascular diseases.
