                        "Obesity, which is a representative symptom of excessive accumulation of fat in the body, is classified as one of the major metabolic diseases and is a serious health problem faced by countries around the world. At least 300 million people will be obese by 2025, and thus obesity drug markets are expected to grow greatly not only in Korea but also globally.",
                        "Obesity is known to cause diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and the like in combination, and in severe cases, it results in early death.",
                        "Obesity is also classified as chronic inflammation, and recent studies have revealed that inflammatory macrophages accumulated in adipose tissue are closely associated with obesity. Moreover, the obesity condition creates an inflammatory environment due to an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages in fat, and the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages increases the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 or interleukin 6, aggravating the symptoms of obesity.",
                        "Although the alleviation of an inflammatory environment and the balance of macrophages are considered to be important for the treatment of obese patients, as of yet, there is no obesity therapeutic agent that targets macrophages.",
                        "Current obesity treatments include diet, exercise, and drug therapies. However, drug therapies have problems with respect to stability and side effects since the administration period increases, and thus there is a need for the development of novel obesity therapeutic agents.",
                        "At present, only orlistat and lorcaserine are approved for long-term use in Korea, and various therapeutic agents, such as liraglutide, phentermine/topiramate, and naltrexone/bupropion, have been developed and approved in the U.S. However, the development of fundamental obesity therapeutic drugs is urgent since many drugs decrease the body weight in a manner that interferes with the absorption of fat from foods.",
                        "Phospholipase A2 is a protein enzyme, and phospholipases, which are contained at a content of 12% in bee venom, are enzymes that hydrolyze phospholipids and are also called lecithinases. The phospholipase A2 component is known to cause cell tissue destruction, hemolysis, catalysis, and the like since it liberates fatty acids bonded to BDP of glycerin of phospholipids, which are cell membrane lipids, to form lysophosphatides. Various pharmaceutical compositions can be developed by utilizing such actions of phospholipase A2. Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2015-0049438 discloses a composition capable of preventing and treating viral diseases, such as influenza and bullous stomatitis. In addition, Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2012-0139313 discloses a composition containing a phospholipase as an active ingredient for treatment of a prion disease, wherein the composition can be helpfully used as a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and treatment of a regenerative brain disease."

Phospholipases are categorized as A1, A2, B, C, and D according to the degradation site of phospholipids.",
                        "The obesity ameliorating efficacy of PLA2 was not known, and was first identified by the present inventors.",
                        "More specifically, PLA2 may be one (bvPLA2) derived from bee venom of Apis mellifera or one produced by way of genetic recombination (including genetic modification engineering), but is not limited thereto.",

                        "In addition, the effects of PLA2 may be achieved by acting on mannose receptors, alleviating hepatic steatosis or kidney damage through the reduction of the accumulation of lipid droplets, alleviating metabolic dysfunction resulting from the reductions of aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, creatine, triglycerides (TG), glucose (GLU), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), or low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), insulin, and leptin, by inhibiting the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages, by controlling M1/M2 through a reduction of M1 macrophages or an increase of M2 macrophages, or by inhibiting lipid accumulation and lipid synthesis, but is not limited thereto.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cobesity\u201d refers to a state of an excess of fat in the body, and specifically, obesity is defined as a body mass index (calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared) of 25 or greater. Obesity may be caused by very complex causes, such as genetic and environmental factors, but consequentially, obesity is caused by the accumulation of fat due to energy imbalance occurring in cases of an excessive intake of nutrients relative to energy consumption over a long period of time. Obesity results in an increased likelihood of diabetes and hyperlipidemia and an increased risk of developing sexual dysfunction, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease.",

In addition, single or multiple dosing may be performed. It is important that administration be performed considering all of the aforementioned factors so that a maximum effect can be obtained with a minimum amount without any side effects, and such an amount may be easily determined by a person skilled in the art.",
