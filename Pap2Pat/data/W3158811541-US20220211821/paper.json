    "title": "Targeting of adipose tissue macrophages by bee venom phospholipase A2 attenuates high-fat diet-induced obesity",
    "date": "2021-05-04",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) exist in either the M1 or M2 form. The anti-inflammatory M2 ATMs accumulate in lean individuals, whereas the pro-inflammatory M1 ATMs accumulate in obese individuals. Bee venom phospholipase A2 (bvPLA2), a major component in honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom, exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects via interactions with regulatory T cells (Treg) and macrophages. This study investigated the effects of bvPLA2 on a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice.For in vivo experiments, male C57BL/6, CD206-deficient, and Treg-depleted mice models were fed either a normal diet 41.86 kJ (ND, 10 kcal% fat) or high-fat diet 251.16 kJ (HFD, 60 kcal% fat). Each group was i.p. injected with PBS or bvPLA2 (0.5 mg/kg) every 3 days for 11 weeks. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. Histological changes in the white adipose tissue (WAT), liver, and kidney as well as the immune phenotypes of the WAT were examined. Immune cells, cytokines, and lipid profiles were also evaluated. The direct effects of bvPLA2 on 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages were measured in vitro.bvPLA2 markedly decreased bodyweight in HFD-fed mice. bvPLA2 treatment also decreased lipid accumulation in the liver and reduced kidney inflammation in the mice. It was confirmed that bvPLA2 exerted immunomodulatory effects through the CD206 receptor. In addition, bvPLA2 decreased M1 ATM and alleviated the M1/M2 imbalance in vivo. However, bvPLA2 did not directly inhibit adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 adipose cells in vitro.bvPLA2 is a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of obesity by regulating adipose tissue macrophage homeostasis.",

                "Obesity is a growing global health problem that is characterized by the excess accumulation of body fat and a high body mass index (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930) [1, 2]. This global epidemic has been identified as a major health risk that reduces the quality of life and increases the mortality rate due to insulin resistance. Obesity is often accompanied by other diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, polycystic osteoarthritis, and metabolic disorder. Treatment of obesity requires long-term, lifestyle management (healthy eating and exercise); however, its effects can be extremely difficult to control. The development of novel treatments, without adverse effects, remains a priority in healthcare [3\u20135].",
                "Excessive accumulation of fat in white adipose tissue (WAT) triggers the improper release of adipokines, free fatty acids (FFAs), and triglycerides (TG) from adipocytes and accelerates the activation of I\u03baB kinase (IKK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and the Nuclear factor kappa B pathways, resulting in insulin resistance and chronic inflammation [6, 7]. Furthermore, it has been reported that the accumulation of immune cells, such as macrophages, monocytes, and lymphocytes, in adipose tissue (AT) is increased in the obese state. It has been shown that most of these immune cells infiltrating the AT are macrophages [8, 9]. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) have been known to rapidly increase in the early stages of obesity, inducing inflammation and adipocyte apoptosis [10\u201312]. There are two types of ATMs, classically activated M1 macrophages and alternatively activated M2 macrophages [13]. M1 ATMs release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and MCP-1. The recruitment of M1 ATMs in the AT leads to insulin resistance and adipocyte dysfunction [14]. In contrast, M2 ATMs secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, and highly express Arg1 and Ym1 [15, 16]. In the lean state, most of the resident macrophages in the AT are polarized to the M2 phenotype, and they maintain normal adipocyte function via tissue remodeling and angiogenesis [17]. Previously, it was reported that macrophages express mixed M1/M2 forms in response to high-fat diet (HFD), but continued HFD induces more of the M2-like form of macrophages [18]. The M1/M2 imbalance toward the M1 phenotype results in inflammation and adipocyte dysfunction, whereas switching from the M1 to M2 phenotype improves the browning reaction of the WAT and insulin sensitivity [19]. Hence, targeting ATMs as a therapeutic strategy could be important for the treatment of obesity [20\u201322]. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is one of the major components in honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom. It has been shown that the secreted PLA2 isoform (sPLA2-V) and group VIA PLA2 (PLA2-VIA) are involved in polarizing macrophages to the M2 form in obesity [23, 24]. Distinct from sPLA2-V and iPLA2-VIA, bee venom PLA2 (bvPLA2) has also exhibited therapeutic effects on Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pulmonary inflammation, and atopic dermatitis through an increase in the Foxp3+ regulatory T-cell populations (Treg) resulting in reduced inflammation [25\u201328]. Tregs play a major role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing effector T cells, B cells, and other myeloid lineage cells that induce macrophages. According to previous reports, bvPLA2 binds to dendritic cells via the CD206 mannose receptors. When bvPLA2 binds to the surface of dendritic cells, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion is increased via stimulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in the differentiation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) via EP2 receptor signaling in Th0 cells [25]. However, the direct interaction of bvPLA2 on macrophages is still not well understood, despite the fact that macrophages abundantly express CD206. The proven various and strong immune modulatory effects of bvPLA2 supports its application in inflammation-associated obesity. In this study, we investigated the effect of bvPLA2 on macrophage inflammation in a HFD-induced obesity mouse model."

Compared to the ND group, the size and weight of the liver in the HFD group were increased due to hepatomegaly, associated with lipid droplet accumulation. However, PLA2 treatment attenuated these increases in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 2A, B). Lipid droplet accumulation in the liver significantly increased in the HFD group compared to the ND group and decreased in the HFD\u2009+\u2009PLA2 group compared to the HFD group (Fig. 2C, D). Next, we examined the glomerular diameter as an early indicator of diabetic nephropathy and kidney damage. Hypertrophy, or increased glomerular diameter, in the kidneys due to lipid accumulation was observed in the HFD, and PLA2 was shown to alleviate the hypertrophy (Fig. 2E, F).

The levels of GLU, HDL-C, and LDL-C were markedly higher in the HFD group, and these were significantly reduced in the HFD\u2009+\u2009PLA2 group compared to the HFD group. TG was also increased in the HFD group compared to the ND group, and slightly increased in the ND\u2009+\u2009PLA2 group compared with the ND group. This was decreased in the HFD\u2009+\u2009PLA2 group compared to the HFD group but without statistical significance (Fig. 2H). Plasma insulin and leptin levels were increased in the HFD group compared to the ND group and were significantly decreased in the HFD\u2009+\u2009PLA2 compared to the HFD group. However, adiponectin levels did not differ significantly among the groups (Fig. 2I). These results indicated that bvPLA2 alleviated HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction."

                "Obesity is a serious health problem both nationally and globally, and the current available treatments have variable efficacy or have a high risk of adverse effects. Currently, three drugs are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity; orlistat, diethylpropion, and phentermine [30]. However, long-term treatment with these drugs is associated with several serious side effects, such as liver injury, kidney stones, and pancreatitis [31]. In addition, most anti-obesity drugs decrease body weight by inhibiting the absorption of fat from foods, resulting in steatorrhea [32]. Although regulating the inflammatory state is critical for the prognosis of obese patients, there is currently no available treatment for managing this aspect of obesity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop treatments that are more effective for obesity.",
                "In this study, we demonstrated the beneficial effects on obesity of anti-inflammatory therapy using bvPLA2. It has been reported that bvPLA2 has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects by reducing inflammation. The specific compound in bvPLA2 that contributes to its anti-obesity effect is not well established. To elucidate the therapeutic effects of bvPLA2 on inflammatory obesity, we used several HFD-induced obesity mouse models. Our results showed that bvPLA2 prevented rapid body weight gain by reducing adipocyte size in the WAT of the mice without affecting food intake (Fig. 1). This may explain that bvPLA2 contributed to the body weight effect without changing appetite, but energy expenditure or food absorption may different. Thus, further investigation will be required to confirm this issue.",
                "AT, which is composed of adipocytes, is the main fat storage of the body as well as having metabolic control [33] and is divided into two types, white and brown AT (WAT and BAT, respectively) [34]. WAT contains large lipid droplets and releases adipokines (FFAs, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) to maintain metabolic homeostasis and stores TG for future energy production during periods of malnutrition. In contrast, BAT contains multiple small lipid droplets and maintains body temperature and weight by converting consumed food into heat through UCP-1-mediated thermogenesis [35, 36]. Given that BAT can eliminate circulating GLU and TG during heat production, the browning of WAT, which means the switching of WAT to a BAT-like phenotype, might be a useful therapeutic strategy for obesity. To verify specific protective effects of bvPLA2 against the liver and kidney, we performed histological analysis in the HFD-induced mice. This showed that bvPLA2 prevented hepatic steatosis and glomerular hypertrophy in vivo. Importantly, it also prevented liver and kidney dysfunction and inhibited the elevation of GLU, cholesterol, and insulin levels in serum (Fig. 2). In addition, bvPLA2 significantly reduced obesity-induced macrophage infiltration into eWAT and subsequent CLS formation, which is related to adipocyte death. We also investigated whether bvPLA2 regulates M1 or M2 macrophages and adipogenic factors in obesity. M1/M2 lipid accumulation and adipogenesis-related markers were all examined (Fig. 3). M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages in the AT were significantly decreased, while M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages were increased by bvPLA2, suggesting that bvPLA2 stimulates M2-phenotypic macrophage differentiation. It has been shown that bvPLA2 significantly promotes UCP-1 and suppresses C/EBP \u03b1 [30]. In our study, we suggested that bvPLA2 may participate in M1 and/or M2 polarization and thus control adipogenesis.",
                "Several studies have reported that ATMs in lean individuals maintain homeostasis; however, the number of ATMs quickly increases in obese individuals. As obesity progresses, the accumulation of inflammatory M1 ATMs becomes a major source of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which can lead to insulin resistance via activation of endocrine signaling [16, 37]. Given that M2 ATMs maintain insulin sensitivity and homeostasis in AT [38], increased M2 polarization in ATMs is beneficial to improve insulin sensitivity. To clarify whether bvPLA2 directly reduced macrophage polarization or adipogenesis, BMDM and 3T3-L1 cells were used (Fig. 4). bvPLA2 stimulated M2 differentiation, while inhibiting M1 polarization but did not directly inhibit adipogenesis in vitro. In the present study, we also investigated the effect of bvPLA2 in an adipocyte and macrophage coculture system and observed the bvPLA2 enhances the anti-inflammatory response, indicating that it reduces lipid accumulation in the obese state. Moreover, we found that bvPLA2 modulated the M1/M2 macrophage ratio in AT (Fig. 5). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the characteristics of CD206+ ATMs exhibit selectively depleted CD206+ M2-like macrophages in CD206DTR mice [39]. They proved that CD206+ cells play an important role in WAT remodeling, and that CD206 can be used as a specific marker for M2-like ATMs. From these results, we demonstrated that bvPLA2 alleviates the M1/M2 imbalance in vivo.",
                "We previously reported that bvPLA2 binds to the CD206 mannose receptor to promote Treg [25]. However, the specific mechanism by which bvPLA2 interacts with CD206 in macrophages, and its function, has not been confirmed. In this study, we tried to confirm the effect of bvPLA2 on macrophages. We used a CD206-deficient and Treg depletion mouse model to examine whether the therapeutic effect of bvPLA2 is associated with the mannose receptor and/or increased the Treg population in AT (Fig. 6). CD206\u2212/\u2212 mice showed no effective response to bvPLA2 treatment, indicating that bvPLA2 has immunomodulatory effects by binding to the CD206 receptor. Moreover, we found that depletion of Tregs by PC61 (anti-CD25 antibody) did not reverse the effect of bvPLA2, indicating that Tregs are not a major responder in bvPLA2 treatment in this model (Supplementary Fig. 1).",
                "In conclusion, our study revealed a novel effect of bvPLA2 on macrophages. Here, we demonstrated that bvPLA2 has the therapeutic effect of reducing macrophage inflammation in the HFD-induced obesity mouse model. Thus, we propose that bvPLA2 has an important effect on the modulation of macrophage activity in a state of inflammation. In addition, we verified the potential of bvPLA2 as a therapeutic agent for obesity, through its modulation of the M1/M2 macrophages ratio."
