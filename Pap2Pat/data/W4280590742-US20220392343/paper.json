    "title": "Dynamic Routing of Heterogeneous Users After Traffic Disruptions Under a Mixed Information Framework",
    "date": "2022-05-18",
    "abstract": "This research focuses on reducing traffic congestion using the competing strategies between informed and uninformed drivers. Under a mixed information framework, a navigation app provides within-day route suggestions to informed drivers using predicted information about the time-varying route habits of uninformed drivers. The informed users detour from initially proposed routes to minimize network congestion after traffic disruptions, pushing the system toward optimal equilibrium, while uninformed drivers make day-to-day decisions which push the system toward user equilibrium. Simulations considering varying fractions of informed drivers show that congestion is reduced during abrupt phase transition before reaching equilibrium by approximately 59.2% when 20% of drivers are informed, and is nearly eliminated when 80% of drivers are informed, which could be achieved through connected vehicle technologies. Shared memory multi-core parallelization improved the computational efficiency.",

                "Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) algorithms have been used to capture dynamic interaction between supply and demand under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions in a transportation network. The two optimal conditions for a transportation network are Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE) and Dynamic System Optimal (DSO) equilibrium (Yu et al., 2020). Most DTA algorithms solve for one of Wardrop's equilibrium conditions using a single group of drivers who share a common objective of minimizing their own travel cost or the total system cost. This research considers a novel application of DTA which realistically simulates a transportation network in which drivers have different objectives and different time scales over which they make decisions in an attempt to optimize the system. We define informed drivers as the ones who are given predictive route guidance from a system manager (e.g., traffic operation center) through GPS-based applications and assume that these drivers will make a bounded route choice with the provided guidance. Informed drivers are expected to comply with the provided guidance if they are given sufficient incentives and/or if the new route is not noticeably different from the original choice in terms of the cost. Such compliance will become more practical with shared autonomous vehicles that are expected to lower traveler's disutility of travel time through credits from the company for following those suggestions.",
                "The role of information is especially relevant under expected and unexpected disruptions to infrastructure. Transportation networks are commonly impacted by short-term and long-term disruptions caused by natural or man-made events. For example, a multi-day construction zone on a highway can increase the travel time if travelers continue to follow the same route. Similarly, a post disaster event such as flooding of neighborhood streets or a tree collapse may result in reduced capacity on certain links. In this study, we propose a mixed objective framework (Figure 1) that provides a method for a group of informed drivers to reduce the within-day congestion caused by uninformed drivers who are making choices based on day-to-day habits on route and departure time after a traffic disruption. Informed drivers are provided with the within-day route guidance based on the anticipated behaviors of uninformed drivers on the network day-to-day, by adjusting route choices toward system optimum. We assume that day-to-day evolution follows the same framework as the iterative process of DTA models and accurately simulates the iterative day-to-day transition of the adaptive and bounded behavior of uninformed drivers during the disruption of a transportation network. The resulting congestion patterns are caused by uninformed drivers' discrete decision-making processes before reaching equilibrium. The day-to-day decision-making of uninformed drivers may result in congestion depending on levels of perturbations and network congestion. This research presents a methodology to reduce the congestion caused by uninformed users making day-to-day decisions by strategically rerouting informed drivers. The within-day traffic dynamics are incorporated into the simulation at the end of the day to reoptimize (offline) next day's informed driver strategy considering day-to-day dynamics of uninformed drivers. For an application to a post disaster event, day 1 of the model is after loading within-day travel behaviors of the day of the collapse. The methodology applied to inform human drivers in this research is also applicable to Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) operating in mixed autonomy networks.",
                "Modern DTA algorithms use a Dynamic Network Loading (DNL) procedure to simulate traffic dynamics on a transportation network (Osorio et al., 2011). The procedure incorporates a cell or link transmission model and considers junction dynamics. In the presented model, the DNL procedure is used for two separate groups of drivers who are seeking different objectives over different time scales. Uninformed drivers make route choices to seek Day-to-Day (DTD) Boundedly Rational (BR) DUE. Informed drivers take detours to seek Within-Day (WD) DSO equilibrium within their indifference band, not blindly following the recommendation from a phone app or system manager. This assumption is justified because the routes for informed travelers can be selected by the system manager such that system efficiency improves, while the uninformed travelers choose routes selfishly to minimize their own time. The approach taken in this research is an upper-level algorithm that solves for Day-to-Day BRDUE and a lower-level algorithm that solves for WD DSO equilibrium. Each DTD BRDUE iteration considers the prior day's route and departure time choices and uses this information to solve for the next day. A DTD BRDUE algorithm will not achieve equilibrium on day one, because each user must complete their trip on a given Origin-Destination (O-D) pair to make an informed decision on their next trip, which occurs the following day. This method more accurately simulates the way that a transportation network approaches BRDUE following a perturbation to the network dynamics, such as construction or a change in signal timings.",
                "When the network is perturbed, users will experience significant delays on the day of the perturbation because the route and departure time choices for uninformed drivers are based on their experience with the prior day's trip and their memory of other trips. If a serious delay occurs, their route and departure time choice the next day will consider this new information. In order to improve this framework by addressing Within-Day delays, a WD DSO algorithm that reacts to predictable delays caused by the behavior of DTD BRDUE seeking users is proposed. The WD DSO algorithm influences the decision-making of a subset of the population of drivers by providing them with predictive information in order to push the system toward DSO equilibrium. The rest of article is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the main contribution of this paper against the literature. Section 3 describes the proposed mixed objective framework for uninformed and informed decision making. Section 4 describes congestion reduction for varying fraction of informed drivers. Finally, we conclude with future research directions."

                "Mathematical methods of achieving time-dependent User Equilibrium (UE) and System Optimal (SO) equilibrium conditions in transportation networks were established by Peeta and Mahmassani (1995). The authors found that when congestion becomes very high, the ability to reroute vehicles decreases due to gridlock. Under these conditions, rerouting vehicles fail to substantially reduce congestion. Recently, information sharing between Day-to-Day (DTD) Boundedly Rational Dynamic User Equilibrium (BRDUE) seeking agents in a DTA simulation has been explored (Han et al., 2019;Yu et al., 2020). Within-Day (WD) Dynamic System Optimal (DSO) DTA problems have also been solved using a novel projection model in conjunction with a cell transmission model (Doan and Ukkusuri, 2015). A mixed behavior model of UE and stochastic UE in DTD route flow evolution was modeled (Zhou et al., 2017). In line with those advances, in this paper, we provide the drivers with predicted information of the future state during the critical period when they can change the decision before reaching equilibrium, especially when we still have room to reroute a subset of vehicles that can reduce congestion. Below, we review proactive routing guidance under uncertain information to reach BRDUE and BRDSO considering time-varying route habits of drivers.",
                "A proactive route guidance was proposed to assign users to a small subset of all the possible paths considering the maximum travel inconvenience allowed (Angelelli et al., 2018), then the solution was extended to column generation algorithm to improve the exponentially increasing size of the path (Angelelli et al., 2021). The Predictive DUE (PDUE) condition in which a user chooses a route that minimizes the actual travel time along the route to the user's destination while anticipating the future traffic state has been explored (Varia et al., 2013). The PDUE concept has been successfully applied to macroscopic pedestrian flow models (Jiang et al., 2016). The possibility to solve for a PDUE condition in congested capacity-constrained networks using DTA and the method of successive averages (MSA) has been demonstrated (Yildirimoglu and Geroliminis, 2014;Yildirimoglu et al., 2015;Yu et al., 2020). DTA using mesoscopic fundamental diagram dynamics has been applied to a multi-region network composed of 3 regions and 19 subregions (Yildirimoglu et al., 2015). Results showed that using route guidance to push a network toward a system optimal condition does not penalize a significant proportion of drivers. The route choice behavior with information under uncertainty was investigated (Avineri and Prashker, 2006). Analysis of the effects on transportation networks by human drivers operating under mixed information on simple single Origin-Destination (O-D) networks with two route choices was performed (Litescu et al., 2015;Litescu et al., 2016b). Prior research examining the effects of informed and uninformed drivers indicated that the stability of the network is dependent upon the percentage of informed drivers (Litescu et al., 2015). In a network in which drivers are given a choice over the route, but not departure time, the authors demonstrated that a level of approximately 40% informed drivers provides optimal network performance; however, network instability arises when the number of informed drivers deviates from the optimal percentage (Litescu et al., 2015). The authors did not investigate predictive decision making by informed drivers, rather the authors assumed that informed drivers make instantaneous decisions based on the current state of the network.",
                "Additional evaluation of the effects of information uncertainty under the same network and conditions was performed (Litescu et al., 2015;Litescu et al., 2016b). The authors determined when informed drivers receive imperfect information, the equilibrium condition for a transportation network is still highly correlated with the fraction of informed drivers, with the level of 40% informed drivers being the most robust to information inaccuracy under the conditions of the study. Agent-based behavioral models of driver compliance with Variable Message Sign (VMS) suggestions based on survey data have been developed (Litescu et al., 2015). The author considered the effects of VMS on drivers in a simulation of the Brisbane Western corridor. Several model application areas were identified, including varying the type and accuracy of the presented information, as well as varying the fraction of users provided with information. Research has demonstrated that dynamic perturbations to traffic light timing can negatively impact congestion under light traffic loads, due to drivers' difficulty in predicting the behavior of the traffic light (Litescu et al., 2016a). DTA literature has focused on estimating the impact of information on bounded choice and mitigating traffic congestion under DUE and DSO conditions, either within-day or day-to-day.",
                "Mahmassani and his colleagues have shown that the \"indifference band\" of commuters may cause them not to switch to shorter paths even all path cost information is available to travelers (Mahmassani and Jayakrishnan, 1991;Mahmassani and Liu, 1999;Mahmassani, 2001). Boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (BRDUE) and variable tolerance boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (VT-BRDUE) problems have been analyzed (Simon, 1962;Han et al., 2015). In the latter problem, the path used and actual departure rates determine the tolerances of boundedly rational users in system. A comprehensive review of models and methodologies for boundedly rational route choice behavior was composed by Di and Liu (2016). The authors note that models which assume perfect rationality suffer from estimation and prediction errors. Additionally, human behavior under stable situations is myopic as well as significantly based upon formed habits (Jotisankasa and Polak, 2006;Di and Liu, 2016). Unified methods for determining driver route choice behavior with models that consider bounded rationality and learning mechanisms have been considered (Di and Liu, 2016). The use of thresholds has been considered for updating driver perceptions when a discrepancy between perceived travel time and experienced travel time exists (Jotisankasa and Polak, 2006). The consequences of BRUE on the Braess paradox, which describes the paradoxical discovery that the addition of more links to a transportation network can worsen travel times, have been explored (Di et al., 2014). The Braess paradox is largely addressed by bounded rationality, but can still occur for travel demands which fall within a certain range. The authors found that the Braess paradox can be avoided by reducing discrepancies between selfish routing and optimal routing.",
                "Real-world agents have been shown to repeat habitual behavior until prompted to search for alternatives, for example, when searching for different mechanisms of meeting their travel demand (Xiong et al., 2015) with data-driven methods (Zhu et al., 2010). Bias caused by self-reporting preference data and driving simulators' impact of en-route diversion decisions under real-time information has been considered (Xiong and Zhang, 2013a). Modeling of agent level departure time choice under uncertainty has demonstrated that under high uncertainty, agents do not easily converge on an optimized equilibrium (Xiong and Zhang, 2013b). Research has demonstrated that flexible work schedules allow departure times to vary more greatly which reduces congestion in a transportation network (Zhu et al., 2015). The authors found that congestion could be reduced even when a relatively small percentage (10-20%) of road users had flexible work schedules. Agent-based simulations of an interstate corridor in Washington, D.C. have revealed that 6.2% of trips during peak-hours will switch departure times to avoid congestion (Zhang et al., 2013).",

                        "Unlike prior research, the presented model contains a mixture of informed and uninformed drivers with different routing behaviors towards reaching equilibrium across different time scales. Uninformed drivers make their route and departure time choices based on the memory of their own prior effective travel cost (Han, Eve, and Friesz, 2019) and selfishly seek to minimize their own travel time (Wardrop, 1952). If all drivers are uninformed, the route choices will iteratively converge to the BRDUE conditions. The informed drivers in the presented model are assumed to be accessing an app, which they use to determine their route and departure time choice. The informed drivers make within-day decisions based on the information presented by the app, which suggests the best routes based on the predicted network state for that day. Unlike the uninformed drivers, informed drivers are given routes that seek to push the system toward WD DSO equilibrium. Informed drivers' route and departure time choices are calculated using a separate withinday DNL procedure. The within-day DNL procedure is used to calculate the PMC for each route and departure time. PMC considers the additional delay on all other drivers when an informed driver chooses a given route and departure time.",

Details on the network is in the scenario design of result section. These drivers are selfishly seeking to minimize their own travel time (Wardrop, 1952). \u2022 Group 2 (Informed): Choose route and departure time using a smart phone navigation app, which suggests routes with the least PMC. This is calculated using a within-day DTA algorithm. These drivers are directed to push the system toward DSO, mitigating congestion caused by the inability of uninformed drivers to predict perturbations in the network.",
                        "The extent to which Group 2 (Informed drivers) can be rerouted is subject to additional constraints based on information gained for other informed drivers and their own indifference bands. Informed drivers need to be convinced to choose a system optimal route and it will only work over time if the maximum deviation from a user optimal route is within their indifference band, which is defined as a range of total travel times over which the informed travelers are indifferent. For example, if the shortest travel time at DUE between an OD pair is Z units and the indifference band for an informed traveler is z units, then informed travelers are convinced to switch their routes and departure times based on their experienced travel time such that their resulting travel time is at most Z + z. In our simulations, we assume the range of indifference band is up to 400 s following Han et al. (2019). This system more closely approximates the mixed autonomy and mixed information conditions that are likely to be encountered in transportation networks during the next decade. This research is particularly applicable to smaller and mid sized cities where less information is available and uninformed drivers are more likely to repeatedly use the same route based only on past experience. The total system costs are then compared across the two scenarios: (a) the DTD BRDUE algorithm alone and (b) the mixed information group using the DTD BRDUE and WD DSO algorithms. A flow diagram in Figure 3 outlines the general framework. The mixed objective model starts from the initialization of the demand for each O-D pair at each departure time without informed drivers switching routes, run day to day and within-day DNL until the minimum solution is found in DSO with informed drivers strategy for a fixed number of days."

We define C k to be the minimum capacity across all links along the path. While the congested links and time of congestion are computed from DNL, we consider the revised BPR to approximate the change in cost to all other paths due to change in flow on path k. To compute the impact of one unit of flow with and without the presence of congestion, we find all the paths that go through congested links in route k and iterate through all of the links in route k. Once the value of PMC TT k,t is approximated, the revised destination arrival time is estimated at the destination of route k for a departure time t, and the new value of PMC SDC k,t is approximated using Eq. 14 as before. Substantial computational improvements are made by only calculating PMC for paths and times which incur congestion and which propagate congestion onto other paths and departure times (Doan and Ukkusuri, 2015). This is accomplished by avoiding computing PMC for all uncongested paths and times, since these paths and times are assumed to be traversed at the free flow travel time and have no marginal cost on other paths or departure times. In addition, no PMC calculations are required for other paths and departure times which are unaffected by congestion on a given path at a given time. As shown in the triangular fundamental diagram (Eq. 5), there is no impact of an additional vehicle below critical density for the link. Using these methods, the total number of paths and departure times requiring PMC calculation is minimized for a given spatiotemporal distribution of congestion in the network. After PMC for each path is solved, informed drivers make an updated decision using the Informed Driver Mlogit Model (IDMM) described in the next subsection, then the DNL model is executed to generate a new congestion pattern based on the decisions of informed drivers."

Figure 9 shows three possible paths from Node 1 to Node 4 in the Sioux Falls Network, which are paths 5, 6, and 7 in the list of 6,180 routes. Two of these paths contain shared links, and users choosing paths 5 or 6 will contribute to congestion on links 1 and 4.

Users choosing path 7 should not contribute to congestion for paths 5 and 6 because there are no shared links in the paths.

We focus on perturbations caused by disruption such as random incidents, traffic crashes, and work zones, having an impact to cause a change in travelers' route choices. In the first 50 days, the incident rate is low and the uninformed drivers quickly reach a BRDUE condition after several days. During the second 50 days, a period of daily perturbations is caused by high incident rates. As shown in samples in the green circle in Figure 10, the uninformed users are unable to adapt to these perturbations, because their daily route choices are dictated by the weighted experience of the past 3 days. The final 50 days show a return to the low incident rate; however, the uninformed drivers require several days to adjust before again achieving a BRDUE condition, which is the focus of this study. The effects of the informed decision are highlighted on the day when the perturbation occurs and the next day when the memory still remains. While planned construction sites will provide us enough time to compute long-term dynamics of the system, updates on short-term dynamics from random event will be challenging.

This departure rate can be considered as a substantial perturbation from the equilibrium state of the system e.g., even when 20% of drivers on a path with congestion are informed. Figure 11 shows the Day 1 congestion when 20% of the users are informed and switch their route and departure time in order to reduce congestion on all other paths. The perturbation occurs on Day 1 and uninformed users decide to switch their route and departure time choices on Day 2, based on their perceived travel times for the previous day. If no additional perturbations occur, a system of uninformed users will reach a stable BRDUE equilibrium after several days; however, within day delays will occur prior to the system equilibrating. This paper focuses on the within-day transition of traffic state on Day 1 and day-to-day transition of traffic state on day 2, with informed and uninformed decision making strategy. For uninformed drivers, it is expected to take several days to realize the removal of the perturbation in the first day. The departure rates for Day 1 are input to the DTD BRDUE DNL algorithm.

Many of the drivers whose departure time is DT > 70 will not complete their trip prior to the end of the final departure time window.

Compared with the BRDUE only prediction, the paths with constant delay extending to the final DT window have less delay overall when 20% of informed drivers are rerouted. Additionally, the departure times which will not reach the destination before the final departure time window are moved closer to the final departure time window.

                        "Figures 14, 15 compare the average travel time for Day 1 and Day 2 before and after executing the within-day DSO algorithm. Figure 14 shows that as the number of informed drivers increases, the O-D gap for Day 1 decreases significantly. Less improvement is available on Day 2 because the congestion level is much lower due to the adaptations of BRDUE seeking drivers.",
                        "The red bars in Figure 15 show the expected average travel time given the predicted BRDUE departure rates for Days 1 and 2, while the orange bars show the average travel time with departure rate pattern composed of 80% BRDUE seeking uninformed users and 20% DSO seeking informed users. Similarly, the yellow and green bars show average travel time for 60% BRDUE and 20% BRDUE, respectively. Day 2 BRDUE departure decisions are based on the actual travel times for Day 1, which are the result of the Day 1 BRDUE + DSO departure rate pattern. The results for Day 2 are very similar for each case because the perturbation is now anticipated by BRDUE users' experience on Day 1, leaving only small optimality improvements to be made by informed drivers. In a real-world scenario, each day will present its own unique perturbations and having a percentage of DSO seeking informed drivers who can be rerouted to reduce congestion will benefit the average travel time for all users of the network."

                "This research develops novel techniques for informed and uninformed multi-agent route and depature time choice in midsize city environments. The unstable equilibrium conditions encountered in prior informed driver research are resolved using a strategy which ensures that informed drivers only seek DSO when it is necessary to reduce congestion. Even with a small fraction of informed drivers, results show that congestion can be significantly reduced. Adding parallelization to the DSO algorithm reduces the computational time required from more than one day to less than 2 hours. Additional speedup is expected by developing the code in a faster programming language and pursuing further multi-core optimization.",
                "The Within-Day delays incurred in a system which follows a DTD BRDUE model can be improved by including informed drivers whose route and departure time choices seek to push the system toward DSO equilibrium. Results show that even with relatively low numbers of drivers seeking Within-Day DSO, significant improvements in average travel time can be obtained. In the cases of severe congestion caused by perturbations, having 20% informed WD DSO seeking drivers can improve the Day 1 average travel time by 59.2% relative to the next day's DTD BRDUE equilibrium solution. As the number of informed drivers increases, the robustness of the system to perturbations improves. Additionally, because informed drivers do not detour unless significant congestion is present, the model always approaches a DTD BRDUE condition for any fraction of informed drivers, rather than having informed drivers naively seek a DSO equilibrium condition."

            "title": "LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE STUDY",
            "paragraphs": [
                "The main limitation of the study is the computational time required to solve the within-day DSO algorithm due to pathbased formulation of BRDUE. For the Sioux Falls network under high congestion, each DSO iteration can take up to 1.5 h to solve. When congestion is less severe, the DSO iterations are faster because fewer paths and departure times need to be solved. While those extra information gain are considered as random in this study, the future study can maximize removing uncertainty by considering the standard deviation (Folsom et al., 2021) and spatiotemporal correlations (Darko et al., 2020).",
                "Future research goals include using a region-based model with a mesoscopic fundamental diagram (Yildirimoglu et al., 2015). A mesoscopic region-based model could improve traffic state observability, improve computational efficiency on larger networks incorporating highways and freeways, and reduce uncertainty compared with microscopic link-level frameworks and macroscopic frameworks (Aghamohammadi and Laval, 2018). While this research focused on drivers, the informed driver model can also be applied to Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed autonomy network where the centralized framework improves the efficiency with which DSO equilibrium is reached.",
                "Additionally, by considering the spatiotemporal correlation between paths based on historical data or prior simulations, it may be possible to further improve DSO computational time. The number of calculations required to estimate the path marginal cost would be reduced in this case, since the path marginal cost can be inferred from the spatiotemporal correlation between various routes. Including spatiotemporal correlation in a region based model which includes between-region marginal costs could further improve performance by reducing the number of calculations needed to determine the marginal cost within each region and providing additional methods of parallelization such as network partitioning (Yahia et al., 2018).",
                "While the benefit of the proposed informed decision after the first day is much less, there are still remaining memory impacting the choice, influenced by the first day. This paper targets the DSO before converging to equilibrium, but by finding the percentage of drivers that should be informed, we could lower the within-day delays and converge equilibrium sooner. By using the output from this study, future studies could optimize the percentage of drivers to be informed to minimize within-day delays.",
                "The informed decision making also can be applied to other system decision-making to mitigate traffic congestion. While predictive sensor location (Park and Haghani, 2015;Park et al., 2018) and emergency allocation (Park et al., 2016) problems with anticipated future depended on simulation of uninformed drivers, how information would change the driving behavior to change the system optimal decisions can provide more practical solutions."
