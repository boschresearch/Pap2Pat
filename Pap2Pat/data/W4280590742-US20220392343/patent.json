The methods and systems can be used for reducing traffic congestion using the competing strategies between informed and uninformed drivers.

The informed users detour from initially proposed routes to minimize network congestion after traffic disruptions, pushing the system toward optimal equilibrium, while uninformed drivers make day-to-day decisions which push the system toward user equilibrium. Simulations considering varying fractions of informed drivers show that congestion is reduced during abrupt phase transition before reaching equilibrium by approximately 59.2% when 20% of drivers are informed, and is nearly eliminated when 80% of drivers are informed, which could be achieved through connected vehicle technologies.

                        "This document describes an application of DTA which realistically simulates a transportation network in which drivers have different objectives and different time scales over which they make decisions in an attempt to optimize the system. We define informed drivers as the ones who are given predictive route guidance from a system manager (e.g., traffic operation center) through, for example, global positioning system (GPS)-based applications and assume that these drivers will make a bounded route choice with the provided guidance. Informed drivers are expected to comply with the provided guidance if they are given sufficient incentives and/or if the new route is not noticeably different from the original choice in terms of the cost. Such compliance will become more practical with shared autonomous vehicles that are expected to lower traveler's disutility of travel time through credits from the company for following those suggestions.",
                        "The role of information is especially relevant under expected and unexpected disruptions to infrastructure. Transportation networks are commonly impacted by short-term and long-term disruptions caused by natural or man-made events. For example, a multi-day construction zone on a highway can increase the travel time if travelers continue to follow the same route. Similarly, a post disaster event such as flooding of neighborhood streets or a tree collapse may result in reduced capacity on certain links.",
                        "The methods and systems described in this document use a mixed information framework for providing within-day route suggestions to informed drivers using predicted information about the time-varying route habits of uninformed drivers. The informed users detour from initially proposed routes to minimize network congestion after traffic disruptions, pushing the system toward optimal equilibrium, while uninformed drivers make day-to-day decisions which push the system toward user equilibrium.",
                        "FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating an example mixed objective framework that provides a method for a group of informed drivers to reduce the within-day congestion caused by uninformed drivers who are making choices based on day-to-day habits on route and departure time after a traffic disruption. Informed drivers are provided with the within-day route guidance based on the anticipated behaviors of uninformed drivers on the network day-to-day, by adjusting route choices toward system optimum.",
                        "In some cases, the day-to-day evolution of traffic flows follows the same framework as the iterative process of DTA models and accurately simulates the iterative day-to-day transition of the adaptive and bounded behavior of uninformed drivers during the disruption of a transportation network. The resulting congestion patterns are caused by uninformed drivers' discrete decision-making processes before reaching equilibrium.",
                        "The day-to-day decision-making of uninformed drivers may result in congestion depending on levels of perturbations and network congestion. The systems and methods described in this document can be used to reduce the congestion caused by uninformed users making day-to-day decisions by strategically rerouting informed drivers. The within-day traffic dynamics are incorporated into the simulation at the end of the day to reoptimize (for example, offline) next day's informed driver strategy considering day-to-day dynamics of uninformed drivers. For an application to a post disaster event, day 1 of the model is after loading within-day travel behaviors of the day of the collapse. The methods and systems can be applied to inform human drivers, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) operating in mixed autonomy networks, or both.",

                        "In some examples, the model builders 214 and 218 can be implemented using parallel processing. An additional convenient property of the WD DSO methodology is that it is easily parallelized, allowing further computational improvements over the serial method. The ease of parallelization comes from the fact that each calculation of PMC only considers the effect of one path and departure time on all other paths and departure times. Each PMC calculation is independent of other PMC calculations. Therefore, parallelization can be applied to make the problem more computationally tractable.",
                        "FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of an example method 300 for determining traffic flow models that contain a mixture of informed and uninformed drivers with different routing behaviors towards reaching equilibrium across different time scales. Uninformed drivers make their route and departure time choices based on the memory of their own prior effective travel cost and selfishly seek to minimize their own travel time.",
                        "If all drivers are uninformed, the route choices will iteratively converge to the BRDUE conditions. The informed drivers in the presented model can be, for example, accessing an app, which they use to determine their route and departure time choice. The informed drivers make within-day decisions based on the information presented by the app, which suggests the best routes based on the predicted network state for that day. Unlike the uninformed drivers, informed drivers are given routes that seek to push the system toward WD DSO equilibrium. Informed drivers' route and departure time choices are calculated using a separate within-day DNL procedure. The within-day DNL procedure is used to calculate the PMC for each route and departure time. PMC considers the additional delay on all other drivers when an informed driver chooses a given route and departure time.\n\n\n- - Group 1 (Uninformed): Choose route and departure time based on\n    Effective Path Delay, using DTD BRDUE DTA algorithm, influenced the\n    transition between the presence of perturbations and after removal\n    of perturbations. Drivers are selfishly seeking to minimize their\n    own travel time.\n  - Group 2 (Informed): Choose route and departure time using a smart\n    phone navigation app, or other appropriate navigation system, which\n    suggests routes with the least PMC. This is calculated using a\n    within-day DTA algorithm. These drivers are directed to push the\n    system toward DSO, mitigating congestion caused by the inability of\n    uninformed drivers to predict perturbations in the network.",
                        "The extent to which Group 2 (Informed drivers) can be rerouted is subject to additional constraints based on information gained for other informed drivers and their own indifference bands. Informed drivers should be convinced to choose a system optimal route and, in some cases, it will only work over time if the maximum deviation from a user optimal route is within their indifference band, which is defined as a range of total travel times over which the informed travelers are indifferent.",
                        "For example, if the shortest travel time at DUE between an OD pair is Z units and the indifference band for an informed traveler is z units, then informed travelers are convinced to switch their routes and departure times based on their experienced travel time such that their resulting travel time is at most Z+z. In some example, the range of indifference band is up to 400 seconds.",

The method 300 includes running the DTD BRDUE DNL model (304) and then calculating a path marginal cost (306). The method 300 includes running the WD DSO O-D DNL model (308) and updating the DSO O-D demand values (310).
