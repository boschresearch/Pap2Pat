                        "Typically, human poses indicate various positions that a wide variety of human bodies may employ during daily, extraordinary, or celebratory circumstances. The human poses may differ widely depending on environment factors, lifestyle factors, or the like. A few common examples of the human poses include standing pose, sitting pose, walking pose, sleeping pose, running pose, etc. Also, a type of human activity performed by different individuals may be understood from such variety of human poses. For example, dancing poses of a dancer may indicate dancing activity, cooking poses of a chef may indicate cooking activity, driving poses of a driver may indicate a driving activity. Hence, human poses of a human are indicative of one or more human activities. Conversely, abnormality in the human poses may be indicative of abnormal human activity.",
                        "Nowadays, with advancement in technology and development, it may be desirable to detect anomaly in a pose of a human performing an activity for a number of applications. For example, the anomaly detection in human poses may be useful in security applications, such as driver assisting applications to check the attention of a driver operating a vehicle, in airport security, as well as in health-related applications assisting in taking care of safety of people, or the like.",
                        "However, anomaly detection in the human poses may be a challenging task due to factors related to training data or labelled data corresponding to human anomaly poses. Furthermore, there may be difficulty in obtaining the training data for the human anomaly poses due to non-linearity and complexity in the human poses. The complexity and non-linearity in the human poses may be contributed by different variations in human poses from one individual to another individual. Moreover, manually annotating the labeled data may be a mundane and a challenging task.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need of a solution to overcome the above mentioned challenges for the detection of anomaly in human poses in an efficient and feasible manner."

                        "It is an object of some embodiments to employ an anomaly detector for detection of anomaly poses in a sequence of human poses. It is another object of some embodiments to perform classification of anomaly data corresponding to anomaly human poses from normal data corresponding to normal human poses in the sequence of human poses.",
                        "Some embodiments are based on the recognition that non-availability of training data corresponding to anomalous human poses may be addressed by a discriminative one-class classifier. The discriminative one-class classifier allows to train a model using normal poses of a human performing an activity and allows to use the trained model for detecting poses that do not correspond to the normal poses of the human performing the activity, as anomaly poses. To that end, a single discriminative classifier may be trained to detect anomaly in a human performing activity.",
                        "Some embodiments are based on the realization that non-linearity and complexity of human poses may be addressed by providing a pair of complementary classifiers rather than providing the single discriminative classifier. To that end, the discriminative one-class classifier includes a pair of complementary classifiers. Each discriminative classifier in the pair of complementary classifiers may be trained to bound a space that corresponds to the normal poses of the human performing the activity from different directions. To that end, the normal data may be bounded within boundary of the pair of complementary classifiers. For example, one half-space (e.g., a positive half-space) of the space that corresponds to the normal poses of human performing the activity may be bounded by one discriminative classifier of the pair of complementary classifiers and another half-space (e.g., a negative half-space) of the space may be bounded by another discriminative classifier of the pair of complementary classifiers.",
                        "Further, the pair of complementary classifiers may represent the complexity of the distribution of normal poses of different human activities. For example, the pair of complementary classifiers offers better representational flexibility and more degrees of freedom in characterizing data distribution of the normal poses of the different human activities, while supporting single type of one-class data. However, while replacing a single discriminative classifier with a pair of complementary classifiers solves some problems. However, it creates a number of other problems. Specifically, learning a pair of complementary classifiers on non-linear training data of the human poses may be a non-convex optimization problem.",
                        "Some embodiments are based on the realization that the non-convex optimization problem may be addressed with various optimization techniques, e.g., using Riemannian conjugate gradient optimization on the Stiefel manifold. In mathematics, the Stiefel manifold is a set of all orthonormal k-frames. In other words, the Stiefel manifold is a space of orthogonal (linear) hyperplanes. However, it is difficult to apply the Stiefel manifold on arbitrarily shaped boundaries of discriminative classifiers caused by the non-linearity of the human poses.",
                        "To that end, it is objective of some embodiments to learn the pair of complementary classifiers in a Hilbert space, such as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The RKHS provides potentially infinite linear dimensions that ensures boundary of one or more straight lines or hyperplanes of the pair of complementary classifiers are linear. Examples of the linear boundaries may include a pair of straight-line segments (e.g., hyperplanes), a pair of rectilinear and orthogonal (orthonormal) frames, a pair of normal and non-orthogonal frames (e.g., hyperspheres).",
                        "Some embodiments may use kernel embedding to project distributions of poses to the RKHS. In some other embodiments, different kernels may be used based on distribution of data of the poses to be classified. For example, some embodiments may use a histogram intersection kernel for the distribution of poses captured by a histogram. Another embodiment may use a Chi-sq kernel for histogram data, a linear kernel or Radial basis function (RBF) kernel may be used for data distributed in spherical-shape, and two complementary RBF kernels may be used for data distributed in ring-shape. Another embodiment may use a tree-kernel for hierarchically structured data.",
                        "In various embodiments, the kernel embedding is intermediate and not observed. During training as well as during inference stage of classification of the anomaly poses, the kernel embedding remains internal to optimization and/or the classification. As a result, such a kernel based classification with a pair of complementary classifiers bounding the space of distribution of normal human poses allows reducing the computational complexity of anomaly detection of human activities in a situation when training data of abnormal poses for such an activity are not available.",
                        "In some embodiments, the anomaly detection in the human poses may be implemented in an application, e.g., a vehicle driver assistance system for providing safety and security to a driver as well as one or more occupants of a vehicle. To that end, a sequence of image frames comprising one or more images of the one or more occupants in the vehicle may be captured using one or more image capturing devices installed in the vehicle. The sequence of image frames may be provided as an input data for the anomaly detection in poses of the one or more occupants.",
                        "Accordingly, one embodiment discloses an anomaly detector for detecting an anomaly in a sequence of poses of a human performing an activity. The anomaly detector includes an input interface, a memory, a processor and an output interface.

The human poses may constitute complex and non-linear data due to variance in the human poses. To that end, it is an objective of the anomaly detector to detect the anomaly in the human poses from a distribution of a sequence of poses. In some embodiments, the anomaly is classified from normal data, where the normal data corresponds to a normal (viz. non-anomalous one-class) distribution of pose sequences based on a classifier, such as a discriminative one-class classifier. The discriminative one-class classifier includes a pair of complementary classifiers that bound the normal distribution of pose sequences in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space. To that end, the pair of complementary classifiers may be optimized where distance between the pair of complementary classifiers is minimized and margin of each of the pair of complementary classifiers from the normal data is maximized. The optimization of the pair of complementary classifiers enables bounding the normal distribution of pose sequences from different directions, in an accurate and compact manner. Consequently, the discriminative one-class classifier detects outliers from the bounded normal distribution of pose sequences as anomaly in the human poses. The anomaly detection in the human poses may be implemented in different applications, such as vehicle driver assistance system, security surveillance system, and/or the like.",

In an example embodiment, the sequence of poses 102 may correspond to a set of image frames 104 of a human performing an activity. The set of image frames 104 may be obtained from an image capturing device, e.g., a video camera (not shown in FIG. 1). The sequence of poses 102 may include different human poses of a person, which may be complex and non-linear type of data. Moreover, some poses in the sequence of poses 102 may correspond to normal poses. The normal poses may include normal data of the sequence of poses 102. In some embodiments, these normal data of the normal poses may be used for classifying outliers in the sequence of poses 102 as anomaly data. The anomaly data may correspond to anomaly poses in the sequences of poses 102. Thus, these normal data and anomaly data in the sequence of poses 102 may be discriminated. To that end, the normal data and anomaly data may be discriminated using arbitrarily shaped boundaries of discriminative classes. However, the complexity and non-linearity in the sequence of poses 102 may impact the arbitrarily shaped boundaries of discriminative classifiers.",

To that end, the sequence of poses 102 may be embedded into kernels for projecting the normal distribution of pose sequences to the RKHS. The RKHS includes an infinite dimensional linear space that enables projection of the non-linear input data into a linear space. The infinite dimensional linear space of the RKHS allows better learning of the pair of complementary classifiers when compared against other lower dimensional spaces. For instance, the infinite dimensional linear space of the RKHS allows the pair of complementary classifiers to bound the non-linear input data from different directions. To that end, the RKHS may address the complexity and non-linearity of the input data. The pair of complementary classifiers may be non-linear to bound the non-linear input data. However, each boundary of the pair of complementary classifiers may be linear in the RKHS. In different embodiments, different kernels may be used depending on distribution of data to be classified. For example, in some embodiments, a histogram intersection kernel may be used for the distribution of poses that are captured by a histogram. Likewise, Chi-square kernel is used for histogram data, a linear or RBF kernel may be used for spherical data, and a tree-kernel may be used for hierarchically structured data.",

For instance, one of the pair of complementary classifiers may classify the normal data to a positive half-space in the RKHS and other classifier in the pair of complementary classifiers may classify the normal data to a negative half-space in the RKHS. Thus, the normal data may be bounded from complementary directions using the pair of complementary classifiers. Some of the non-limiting examples of the complementary classifiers may include, but not limited to, a pair of straight-line segments (e.g., hyperplanes), a pair of orthonormal frames (e.g., rectilinear and orthogonal matrices), a pair of normal but non-orthogonal frames, and a pair of non-orthonormal matrices (e.g., hyperspheres), which are shown in FIGS. 3A, 3B and 3C.",
