                        "End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the manifestation of a chronic kidney disease characterized by complete kidney failure or an imminent progression thereto. There are a number of treatments for ESRD including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Hemodialysis, however, is the primary therapy for patients with ESRD. Approximately seventy percent of ESRD patients require chronic, maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). The aim of MHD treatment is to replace kidney function with long-term hemodialysis intervention. MHD decreases nephrological degradation by removing contaminants from the blood and maintaining appropriate blood volume. Hemodialysis is performed by using a dialysis machine that pumps blood from a patient, through a dialyzer, and then back into the patient. Accordingly, hemodialysis therapy is an extracorporeal process that cleanses a patient's blood.",
                        "The number of maintenance dialysis patients in the United States is currently over 400,000 and still growing fast. Two thirds of all dialysis patients die within 5 years of initiation of dialysis treatment, a 5-year survival worse than that of many cancers. Approximately half of all dialysis patients die of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the general population conventional serum levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) predict incident atherosclerotic CVD. Nevertheless, similar to individuals with chronic heart failure (CHF), the conventional CVD risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia are not associated with mortality in these patients; indeed in both dialysis and CHF patients, a low, rather than a high, serum total cholesterol (TC) or LDL-C is associated with higher mortality, a phenomenon known as lipid paradox or reverse epidemiology. Hence, alternative CVD biomarkers including alternative lipid measures are needed to more reliably risk-stratify dialysis or CHF patients.",
                        "Each lipoprotein class consists of a continuous spectrum of particles of different size, density, metabolism, and atherogenic impact. Various studies have evaluated the associations of small LDL subfraction concentration, total LDL particle concentration (LDL-Pc), specific HDL subfractions, and combined measures such as the LDL-C/HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratios with cardiovascular risk. However studies on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are scarce and often limited to conventionally measured TC and LDL-C."

Following ultracentrifugation, a sample containing lipoproteins is separated according to particle size using gel electrophoresis. In one embodiment, nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis is employed, Gradient gels employ an increasing percentage of matrix, e.g., polyacrylamide, in one direction to allow for increased separation of particles with similar properties. In one embodiment, variable rate density gradient gel electrophoresis is employed. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,229. In one embodiment, calibration markers are concomitantly separated on the gel, thereby allowing for the determination of LDL particle size. In one embodiment, due to the small variations in the sphericity among lipoprotein species, the migration distance of each particle is inversely related to particle size. It is well known in the art that polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis may be employed, at various percentages, for suitable separation of molecules or particles. Lipoprotein concentration, defined by particle size relative to the calibration marker, is determined by integration of the area of its peak on a densitometry scan.

Alternatively, prognosis may be expressed as the number of years, on average that a patient can expect to survive as a result of a condition or disease. The prognosis of a patient may be considered as an expression of relativism, with many factors affecting the ultimate outcome.

The absolute levels obtained may depend on an number of factors, including, but not limited to, the laboratory performing the assays, the assay methods used, the type of body fluid sample used and the type of disease a patient is afflicted with. According to the method, values can be collected from a series of patients with a particular disorder to determine appropriate reference ranges. One of ordinary skill in the art is capable of performing a retrospective study that compares the determined LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration levels to the observed outcome of the patients and establishing ranges of levels that can be used to designate the prognosis of the patients with a particular disorder. For example, LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration levels in the lowest range would be indicative of a more favorable prognosis, while LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration levels in the highest ranges would be indicative of an unfavorable prognosis.

                                "Because the level of LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration in a test sample from a patient may relate to the prognosis of a patient in a continuous fashion, the determination of prognosis can be performed using statistical analyses to relate the determined levels to the prognosis of the patient. A skilled artisan is capable of designing appropriate statistical methods. For example, the methods may employ the chi-squared test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, multivariate logistic regression analysis, Cox's proportional-hazard model and the like in determining the prognosis. Computers and computer software programs may be used in organizing data and performing statistical analyses.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the prognosis of MHD patients can be correlated to the clinical outcome of the disease using the LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration level and other clinical factors. Simple algorithms have been described and are readily adapted to this end. The approach by Giles et. al., British Journal of Hemotology, 121:578-585, is exemplary. As in Giles et al., associations between categorical variables (e.g., LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration and clinical characteristics) can be assessed via crosstabulation and Fisher's exact test. Unadjusted survival probabilities can be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. The Cox proportional hazards regression model also can be used to assess the ability of patient characteristics (such as LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration levels) to predict survival, with \u2018goodness of fit\u2019 assessed by the Grambsch-Therneau test, Schoenfeld residual plots, martingale residual plots and likelihood ratio statistics (see Grambsch et al, 1995). In some embodiments, this approach can be adapted as a simple computer program that can be used with personal computers or personal digital assistants (PDA). The prediction of patients' survival time in based on their LDL particle size and/or LDL subfraction concentration levels can be performed via the use of a visual basic for applications (VBA) computer program developed within Microsoft\u00ae Excel. The core construction and analysis may be based on the Cox proportional hazard models. The VBA application can be developed by obtaining a base hazard rate and parameter estimates. These statistical analyses can be performed using a statistical program such as the SAS\u00ae proportional hazards regression, PHREG, procedure. Estimates can then be used to obtain probabilities of surviving from one to 24 months given the patient's covariates. The program can make use of estimated probabilities to create a graphical representation of a given patient's predicted survival curve. In certain embodiments, the program also provides 6-month, 1-year and 18-month survival probabilities. A graphical interface can be used to input patient characteristics in a user-friendly manner.",
                                "In some embodiments of the invention, multiple prognostic factors, including LDL particle size and/or LDL subtraction concentration level, are considered when determining the prognosis of a patient. For example, the prognosis of a cancer patient may be determined based on LDL particle size and/or LDL subtraction concentration and one or more prognostic factors selected from the group consisting of status, age, gender and previous diagnosis. In certain embodiments, other prognostic factors may be combined with the LDL particle size and/or LDL subtraction concentration level in the algorithm to determine prognosis with greater accuracy.",

The present study examines which of the different aspects of conventional (triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol) and lipoprotein measurements (total particle concentrations (Pc) including HDL-Pc and LDL-Pc, LDL particle diameter [LDL-Pd] and subfraction-Pc) can better identify MHD patients with an increased death risk.",
                        "The examples described below illustrate methods for assessing risk hazard ratios using serological biomarkers. In MHD patients, traditional lipoprotein monitoring, such as measuring LDL levels, are not associated with cardiovascular events or mortality. However, direct determination of lipoprotein particle sizes and subfraction concentrations are possible via ion mobility analysis. Ion mobility analysis has been previously described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 2008/0305549 and 2008/0302666, and Otvos et al. (Clin. Chem. 54: 1307-1316, 2008). Ion mobility analysis provides for accurate and reproducible physical measurement of both the size and concentration of a broad range of circulating lipoproteins. Additionally, measuring the concentrations of diverse subfractions of lipoproteins elucidates a means for risk-stratification of multi-morbid individuals with chronic disease, e.g., MHD patients.",
                        "Lipoproteins were fractionated into very small, small, medium and large LDL subfractions from archived baseline plasma samples using an ion mobility method. This method uses an ion separation/particle detector system that fractionates lipoprotein particles from the small HDL particles to the large very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and directly counts each lipoprotein particle to permit the determination of lipoprotein particle concentration. Assay characteristics for the ion mobility are as follows: inter-assay variation for LDL-Pd was <1.0% for higher concentration subfractions, HDL and LDL, the CV ranged from 13 to 20% and for lower concentration subfractions, IDL and VLDL, CVs were 17 to 30%. The diameter ranges used for each subfraction are as follows: HDL small, 76.5-105.0 \u212bHDL large, 105.0-145.0 \u212b; LDL very small, 180.0-208.2 \u212b; LDL small, 208.2-214.1 \u212b; LDL medium, 214.1-220.0 \u212b; LDL large, 220.0-233.3 \u212b; IDL 233.0-250.0 \u212b; IDL large, 250.0-296.0 \u212b; VLDL small, 296.0-335.0 \u212b; VLDL medium, 335.0-424.0 \u212b; and VLDL large, 424.0-520.0 \u212b.

FIG. 3 illustrates the statistical interactions, in that above-median vs. below-median serum LDL-C appeared paradoxically protective in the context of above-median LDL-Pd but within the below-median LDL-Pd, above-median serum LDL-C was associated with a trend towards a 47% higher death risk. FIG. 4 shows the Kaplan-Meier proportion of surviving according to the four aforementioned categories of LDL-Pd and LDL-C concentration, which were consistent with the Cox models. We also implemented the same 2\u00d72 approach to examine the mortality-predictability of the four combinations of total LDL-Pc and LDL-Pd by dichotomizing each into above-median versus below-median. Median value for total LDL-Pc=216 nmol/L. We also calculated death hazard ratios of conventional LDL-C, HDL-C and alternative total LDL-P concentrations across above-median and below-median values of alternative LDL-P diameter, in that median values were used to dichotomize each measure forming a 2-by-2 table. After multivariate adjustments above-median total LDL-Pc combined with above-median LDL-Pd was associated with the lowest death risk, i.e. 74% lower mortality compared to below-median total LDL-Pc combined with below-median LDL-Pd.

It was discovered that non-traditional lipoprotein measures could better predict outcomes of MHD patients. Prior studies have indicated a lipid paradox in dialysis patients, in that lower serum TC and LDL-C are paradoxically associated with higher death risk. Hence, alternative lipoprotein measures may more accurately reflect the increased cardiovascular risk in this patient population.",
                        "The present studies demonstrate that conventional TC, LDL-C and HDL-C were not able to predict mortality, consistent with the previous literature in CKD and CHF patient population. Higher HDL-Pc was associated with higher death risk. Prognostic factors for survival in these patients included LDL-P subfraction concentrations and LDL-Pd. Decreased LDL-Pd, indicating smaller LDL particle size, was associated with an increased death risk even after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and conventional measurements of lipids, nutritional status and inflammation. Higher concentrations of very small LDL-P were associated with higher mortality, whereas higher concentrations of large LDL-P were associated with greater survival. The present studies also demonstrate that larger (above-median) LDL-Pd with either above-median or below-median total LDL-Pc was associated with greater survival. In patients with below-median LDL-Pd, the highest risk of mortality was associated with above-median levels of LDL-C. However, above-median LDL-Pc combined with below-median LDL-Pd had a lower risk of mortality than below-median LDL-Pd and below-median LDL-Pc. There is a strong trend in patients with below-median LDL-Pd, above-median LDL-C and above-median LDL-Pc showing increased and decreased risk, respectively. This indicates that the LDL-C content of the LDL particles this population may not be proportional to the LDL-Pd. It is generally assumed that larger the LDL particles contain more cholesterol. However, the present data indicates a difference in particle composition in dialysis patients. It was also found that larger LDL-Pd with either above-median or below-median total HDL-C tended to correlate with greater survival.",
                        "Conventional chemical measures of lipid concentration have long been the most used clinical measurements of lipid profile. However, in chronic disease states such as CKD and CHF these measures do not appear to predict outcomes. Total LDL-Pc and LDL-Pd show better correlation with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than conventional LDL-C. Indeed, conventional LDL-C can be low, yet total LDL-Pc may be high and cardiovascular events rates may be increased. Conversely, conventional LDL-C can be high, yet total LDL-Pc low especially in the setting of low cardiovascular risk. These scenarios are more likely to be the case in chronic disease states such as CKD and CHF where conventional lipid concentrations may be confounded by wasting syndrome and MICS.",
                        "Conventional lipids measurements such as LDL-C and HDL-C have not proven to be of great assistance in MHD patients in assessing cardiovascular or death risk. This was also observed in the present study in which the measurement of LDL-Pd and LDL-P subtraction concentration better identified MHD individuals at increased risk of death for up to 6 years thereafter. The association of LDL-Pd and its subfraction concentrations with death was independent of conventional LDL-C and HDL-C or inflammation. In the present study, adjustments for case-mix and lipids as well as MICS increased the robustness of the ion mobility measured alternative LDL parameter for predicting mortality demonstrating that the LDL-Pd and subfraction concentrations are superior predictors of mortality independent of conventional lipid measurements.",
