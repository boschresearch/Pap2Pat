    "title": "ELIXYS - a fully automated, three-reactor high-pressure radiosynthesizer for development and routine production of diverse PET tracers",
    "date": "2013-07-12",
    "abstract": "Background Automated radiosynthesizers are vital for routine production of positron-emission tomography tracers to minimize radiation exposure to operators and to ensure reproducible synthesis yields. The recent trend in the synthesizer industry towards the use of disposable kits aims to simplify setup and operation for the user, but often introduces several limitations related to temperature and chemical compatibility, thus requiring reoptimization of protocols developed on non-cassette-based systems. Radiochemists would benefit from a single hybrid system that provides tremendous flexibility for development and optimization of reaction conditions while also providing a pathway to simple, cassette-based production of diverse tracers. Methods We have designed, built, and tested an automated three-reactor radiosynthesizer (ELIXYS) to provide a flexible radiosynthesis platform suitable for both tracer development and routine production. The synthesizer is capable of performing high-pressure and high-temperature reactions by eliminating permanent tubing and valve connections to the reaction vessel. Each of the three movable reactors can seal against different locations on disposable cassettes to carry out different functions such as sealed reactions, evaporations, and reagent addition. A reagent and gas handling robot moves sealed reagent vials from storage locations in the cassette to addition positions and also dynamically provides vacuum and inert gas to ports on the cassette. The software integrates these automated features into chemistry unit operations (e.g., React, Evaporate, Add) to intuitively create synthesis protocols. 2-Deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-5-methyl-\u03b2- l -arabinofuranosyluracil ( l -[ 18 F]FMAU) and 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-\u03b2- d -arabinofuranosylcytosine ( d -[ 18 F]FAC) were synthesized to validate the system. Results l -[ 18 F]FMAU and d -[ 18 F]FAC were successfully synthesized in 165 and 170 min, respectively, with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 46% \u00b1 1% ( n = 6) and 31% \u00b1 5% ( n = 6), respectively. The yield, repeatability, and synthesis time are comparable to, or better than, other reports. d -[ 18 F]FAC produced by ELIXYS and another manually operated apparatus exhibited similar biodistribution in wild-type mice. Conclusion The ELIXYS automated radiosynthesizer is capable of performing radiosyntheses requiring demanding conditions: up to three reaction vessels, high temperatures, high pressures, and sensitive reagents. Such flexibility facilitates tracer development and the ability to synthesize multiple tracers on the same system without customization or replumbing. The disposable cassette approach simplifies the transition from development to production.",

                "Positron-emission tomography (PET) has opened the door to in vivo imaging for the purposes of non-invasive disease detection, cancer staging, and drug efficacy screening [1]. 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) is the most commonly utilized PET tracer due to its relative ease of production, manageable half-life, and ubiquitous application [2,3]. The increased demand for [18F]FDG has led to the development of many automated radiosynthesizers to lower its cost, enable its production at many different sites, and reduce the radiation exposure to the radiochemist [4,5].",
                "Though automated synthesis of [18F]FDG is extremely valuable, there are many 18F-labeled PET tracers that await an automated synthesizer to streamline their production [6]. Some of these tracers require high pressures, complicated chemistry, and/or corrosive reagents that make automation difficult. For example, nucleoside analogs that have been used in imaging cell proliferation and reporter gene expression [7-9] and as possible screening agents for chemotherapy drug efficacy [10] often require high-temperature reactions in volatile solvents. Several attempts have been made to automate the syntheses of these tracers on commercially available radiosynthesizers. Often, these attempts have required modifications to the chemistry (e.g., use of alternative solvents or reduced temperatures) to reduce the pressures involved and avoid exceeding the limitations of the radiosynthesizers [8,11-16].",
                "To overcome these synthesizer limitations, we previously developed a platform with movable components that seals the reaction vessel against an inert stopper during reactions to avoid exposure of tubing and valves to high pressures [17]. We further developed this system into a modular computer-controlled platform [18] and demonstrated the successful synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-5-methyl-\u03b2-l-arabinofuranosyluracil (l-[18F]FMAU) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-\u03b2-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (d-[18F]FAC). We describe here the integration of three of these modules into an automated synthesizer [19] and the addition of numerous improvements and features to increase the reliability and user-friendliness of the system. The ELIXYS three-reactor synthesizer is designed to use disposable cassettes for ease of setup and operation and to facilitate rapid transition from tracer development to routine production. The system also has an integrated, automated reagent handling robot to deliver sensitive reagents from sealed vials on demand. This paper describes in detail this radiosynthesizer and its characterization and validation via the synthesis of d-[18F]FAC and l-[18F]FMAU. The details of the software interface were published as a companion article [20]."

                        "The radiosynthesizer (Figure\u00a01) has three key components working in concert: a set of three reactors (Figure\u00a02), a reagent and gas handling robot (Figure\u00a03), and disposable cassettes (Figure\u00a04). The cassettes store reagents in sealed vials, act as the primary fluid path for both reagents and gas flow, and have a rubber gasket affixed to the bottom for sealing the top of glass reaction vessels. Cassettes accelerate setup, eliminate the need for cleaning, and facilitate a natural transition from tracer development to routine production. The reactor subassemblies provide temperature control of the reaction vessel and movement of the vessel to various positions beneath the cassette designed for evaporations, sealed reactions, reagent addition, and transfer of product. Once aligned at the proper position, the reactor is raised to seal the top of the vessel against the gasket on the underside of the cassette. The two-axis reagent and gas handling robot supplies inert gas (to drive fluid movement and assist with evaporations) and vacuum (to remove vapor during evaporations) to special interfaces on the top of the cassettes. A gripper mounted to the same robot manipulates reagent vials between storage and addition positions."

                                "A 5-mL glass V-vial (W986259NG, Wheaton, Millville, NJ, USA) is placed into the reactor and held within a three-segment spring-loaded \u2018chuck\u2019 (Figure\u00a02). The segments press firmly against the vial to ensure excellent thermal contact and thus efficient heat exchange between the reactor and the glass vial. Each segment has one 100-W cartridge heater (CIR-1021-120V-100W-ST-A, Valin, San Jose, CA, USA) and a K-type thermocouple (HTTC72-K-116U-1.25-UNGR, Omega Engineering; Stamford, CT, USA) for individual feedback control of the reactor temperature. The maximum reactor temperature is 185\u00b0C, but we are investigating alternative types of fittings to enable an even higher operating temperature. Since we typically observed very similar temperature response in all three segments, the reactor temperature at any given moment is considered equal to the average of the three temperature readings from the thermocouples. Active liquid cooling is achieved by pumping room-temperature coolant (propylene/ethylene glycol and water mixture) through cooling channels in all three reactors in series using a liquid pump (8030-863-236, Steam Brite, San Antonio, TX, USA) and then through a radiator with three 140-mm fans (HX-CU1403V, Frozen CPU, East Rochester, NY, USA).",
                                "Each reactor is situated beneath a cassette and actuated back and forth among various positions (Figures\u00a04 and 5). In each position, the reactor can be raised using pneumatic cylinders to seal the top of the reaction vessel against a portion of the gasket affixed to the bottom of the cassette. This movement allows for the reaction vessel and fluid path to be dynamically configured for different unit operations (Figure\u00a05). For example, in one position, tubing is present to deliver reagents to the reactor; in another position, there is no tubing, allowing for a reaction under sealed conditions. Permanent tubing and valve connections to the reaction vessel are the root cause of the reaction pressure limitations of most synthesizers [17]. The ability to move the reaction vessel to a dedicated sealed reaction position eliminates these limitations and enables compatibility with higher pressures. To ensure reliable operation, the position of the reaction vessel is monitored via feedback from the linear actuator and the raised or lowered state is detected with Hall effect sensors (D-M9NWL, SMC Corporation, Noblesville, IN, USA).",
                                "We have mounted a camera (PC213XS, Super Circuits, Austin, TX, USA) behind the reactor, which is especially helpful during synthesis development to monitor liquid levels during evaporations, to observe visual cues for reaction progression, to confirm reagent additions and transfers, and for visual inspection of the eluate post purification. The final component of the reactor is a magnet mounted on a DC motor (803-313-5858, KALEJA Elektronik GmbH, Alfdorf, Germany) to rotate a removable magnetic stir bar inside the reaction vessel."

Sealed reagent vials are installed upside-down in the cassettes (Figure\u00a05).",

In the previous prototype to the ELIXYS [21], the cassettes each had multiple inputs on their bottom surface for inert gas and vacuum that mated with corresponding ports on the synthesizer. This system was prone to failure due to the large number of connections and the difficulty in maintaining reliable gas-tight seals during operation. With a single, movable gas supplying robot in ELIXYS, a large number of valves and seals are eliminated, increasing the reliability of the system. The gas supplier is lowered to engage respective vacuum and inert gas ports on top of the cassette (Figure\u00a04). The cassettes contain a rubber gasket around each port to form a gas-tight seal with the port on the robot. The vacuum port is mounted at a height above the inert gas port and on a spring-loaded mechanism to ensure proper sealing of both ports when needed and to avoid collision of the vacuum portion of the gas supplier when vacuum is not needed.",

An in-line check valve (CI-5C, Bio Chem Fluidics, Boonton, NJ, USA) is installed on the inert gas line close to the delivery point to eliminate backflow of vapor. A cold trap (CG451501, Chemglass, Vineland, NJ, USA), cooled in a small Dewar (10-195A, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA, USA), typically with a mixture of dry ice and methanol, is installed in-line between the vacuum port and the integrated vacuum pump (VP0140-V1006-D2-0511, Medo USA Inc., Roselle, IL, USA) with a digital vacuum gauge (ZSE30-N7L, SMC Corporation)."

Three additional vial positions contain dual upward-pointing needles to pierce the septa for delivery of fluids from the reagent vials. One needle in each position is used for fluid delivery; the other connects to an inert gas port on top of the cassette, which allows pressurization of the vial by the gas supplier. In the two reagent addition positions, the fluid delivery needles output directly to the underside of the cassette where the reaction vessel is sealed for reagent addition.

The upstream valve selects between incoming fluid from an external addition line (trapping) or the eluent addition position (release). The output of the first stopcock is connected via tubing to a cartridge. The output of the cartridge is connected to a second tube that feeds into a second stopcock valve that selects whether the fluid is directed to a built-in collection vial (trapping) or a line into the position where the reaction vessel is sealed for reagent addition (release). The third stopcock valve is used for cartridge purification of the crude product before transfer to the next reaction vessel. The purification cartridge is installed between the dip tube (for removal of crude product from the reaction vessel) and the tube leading to the stopcock. The outputs of the stopcock are connected to a built-in waste vial (trapping, washing) or an external output line (release) that can be plugged into the next cassette or the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) injection valve.

The vessel is heated with the option of stirring, and the gas supplier provides both vacuum (to remove vapor) and inert gas (to assist with vapor removal) through the ports on the cassette. The required time for evaporation is generally determined by measuring the maximum time needed for complete evaporation of the solvent from the desired mixture and multiplying by a safety factor. After the desired evaporation time, the reactor is cooled. The low-level steps of the Evaporate unit operation are summarized in Additional file 1: Figure S3."

A dip tube (e.g., made of Teflon\u00ae tubing with an outside diameter (OD) of 1/8 in.) is built into the cassette to act as the fluid path for the transfer of crude products. Tubing with an OD of 1/8 in. is necessary when transferring synthesis products that produce precipitates, but 1/16 in. tubing may be installed for smaller volume transfers. The transfer unit operation begins with the reaction vessel sealing against the transfer position on the cassette (Figures\u00a04 and 5). The gas supplier provides inert gas to pressurize the reaction vessel. This moves the fluid through the dip tube and to the Sep-Pak. After the Sep-Pak, a dedicated stopcock valve in the cassette switches between a fluid path towards a waste collection vial installed on the cassette and a tube that can be plumbed to the input of the next cassette. Often, the first step is to trap the crude product onto the Sep-Pak and allow the residual solution to collect in the waste container. The stopcock position is switched, and elution of the desired product into the next reaction vessel is then performed by adding the elution solvent to the first reaction vessel and repeating the transfer unit operation to elute the product from the Sep-Pak."

Two days afterward, the same four mice were injected with d-[18F]FAC produced at the UCLA Biomedical Cyclotron Facility using a manually operated apparatus [17]. Before scanning, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed in a dedicated imaging chamber designed for use with both the PET and CT systems. Ten-minute whole-body PET images were acquired using a GENISYS4 (Sofie Biosciences Inc., Culver City, CA, USA) and then transferred to the micro-CT (ImTek Inc., Knoxville, TN, USA) for an 8-min scan. Parameters for CT acquisition were 70 kVp, 500 \u03bcA, and an exposure time of 480 s. A Feldkamp reconstruction algorithm was applied. PET/CT images were fused and analyzed using OsiriX Imaging software (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland).

Synthesis times and yields are comparable to or better than other reports found in the literature [11,16,17,24].",
                "The ELIXYS currently supports PET tracer production in our preclinical facility, and therefore, products were confirmed by coinjection with cold standard into the analytical HPLC, and radiochemical purity was found to be >99% for both tracers. However, numerous batches of d-[18F]FAC (as well as other tracers) have been subjected to the complete set of quality assurance tests required for clinical use and have passed. These tests include residual solvent analysis via gas chromatography, Kryptofix K222 spot test, filter integrity test, radionuclide identity by half-life and energy, visual inspection of optical clarity, as well as pyrogenicity and sterility. We are currently updating the software for compliance with current good manufacturing practice, and the updated system will be placed in a clinical facility for production of tracers under 21 CFR 212 regulations or USP 823 guidelines.",
                "In vivo imaging using d-[18F]FAC produced on ELIXYS and that produced by the UCLA Biomedical Cyclotron Facility in a manually operated apparatus [17] showed comparable images and uptake as expected in the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and hematopoietic organs (Figure\u00a08) [25]. Though there appears to be higher \u2018noise\u2019 (muscle uptake) in the images of mice injected with ELIXYS-produced d-[18F]FAC, there is also higher \u2018signal\u2019 (organ uptake). Indeed, whole-body regions of interest excluding the tail showed that the total amount of activity was higher in the images of the mice injected with the ELIXYS-produced tracer. We suspect that there may have been variations in the injections, e.g., more tracer left in the tail in some of the images, leading to a lower amount of activity in circulation. To remove these biases, organ uptake was normalized to a region of muscle tissue that showed no significant uptake.",

The ELIXYS synthesizer contains very few wetted fittings and tubing compared to other radiosynthesizers, yet through the unique use of motion to implement dynamically reconfigurable fluid paths, it is capable of diverse syntheses without hardware customization. It has been designed to be capable of diverse syntheses requiring up to three reaction vessels, high-pressure and high-temperature reactions, as well as sensitive, corrosive, and volatile reagents.",

Several additional tracers of varying complexity have also been successfully synthesized on this system."
