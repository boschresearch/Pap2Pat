                        "Positron emission tomography (PET) has opened the door to in vivo imaging for the purposes of non-invasive disease detection, cancer staging, and drug efficacy screening. The most commonly used PET tracer is 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) due to its relative ease of production, manageable half-life, and ubiquitous application. The increased demand for [18F]FDG has led to the development of a variety of automated radiosynthesizers to lower its cost, enable its production at many different sites, and reduce the radiation exposure of the radiochemist. Automated radiosynthesizers are vital for routine production of PET tracers to minimize radiation exposure to operators and to ensure reproducible synthesis yields.",
                        "Though automated synthesis of [18F]FDG is extremely valuable, there are many 18F-labeled PET tracers that await an automated synthesizer to streamline their production. Some of these tracers require high pressures, complicated chemistries, and/or corrosive reagents that make automation very complicated and difficult. For example, nucleoside analogs that have been used in imaging cell proliferation, reporter gene expression, and as possible screening agents for chemotherapy drug efficacy often require high temperature reactions in volatile solvents. Several attempts have been made to automate the syntheses of these tracers on commercially available radiosynthesizers, but have required modifications to the chemistry (e.g. use of alternative solvents or reduced temperatures) to reduce the pressures involved and avoid exceeding the limitations of the radiosynthesizers.",
                        "The recent trend in the synthesizer industry towards the use of disposable kits aims to simplify setup and operation for the user, but often introduces several limitations related to temperature and chemical compatibility, thus requiring re-optimization of protocols developed on non-cassette-based systems. Radiochemists would benefit from a single hybrid system that provides tremendous flexibility for development and optimization of reaction conditions while also providing a pathway to simple, cassette-based production of diverse tracers."

                        "FIG. 1 illustrates an automated radiosynthesizer 10 according to one embodiment. The automated radiosynthesizer 10 includes a synthesizer 12 where the chemical operations take place to generate a desired radiochemical product such as PET tracer. The synthesizer 12 is controlled by control that interfaces with the synthesizer 12. The control system 14 is used to drive the various hardware components of the synthesizer 12 as described in more detail below. In one aspect of the invention, various client devices 16 can interface with the control system 16 to operate the automated radiosynthesizer 10. For example, the client devices 16 can be used to create or edit various synthesis programs to produce a desired radiochemical product. The client devices 16 may also be used to observe a radiosynthesis run that is currently in progress. The client devices 16 may include a computer such as a laptop or desktop computer or client devices may include mobile devices such as tablets (e.g., Apple iPad, iPhone, and the like), Smartphones (e.g., phones running Google's Android software) and the like. The client devices 16 can interface with the control system 16 using either a dedicated application running on the client device 16 or by using a web browser application. The software that is used as part of the client device 16 may run on a number of different operating systems. Client devices 16 interface with the control system 14 over a network 17 such as a LAN, WAN, or the like. Connections may be wired or wireless.",
                        "As explained herein, the client device 16 can be used to create or edit various synthesis programs to produce the desired radiochemical product. Radiochemistry systems are typically programmed at the level of individual valves and other components, requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying system hardware. Such an approach necessitates a significant learning curve to become familiar with the particular system details and the programming language/interface such that creation and optimization of a desired synthesis can be accomplished. The software used with the client device 16 introduces a new paradigm that strives to eliminate these unnecessary complexities and instead allows the end user to describe the synthesis in terms that make intuitive sense to a chemist or radiochemist that may have no prior experience with automated systems.",
                        "A new synthesis protocol is created in two stages: (1) the reagents that will be used in the synthesis are described, and (2) the program is built by stringing together an ordered sequence of unit operations. The user can switch back and forth between these stages with the caveat that the unit operations cannot be fully configured until the relevant reagents have been defined. Rather than creating all new synthesis programs from scratch, it is also possible to copy an existing synthesis protocol and use that as the starting point. Unit operations refer to those fundamental or building block operations that are employed the radiochemical synthesis process. Examples of unit operations include: ADD (for adding a reagent to a reaction vessel); EVAPORATE (for evaporating the contents of a reaction vessel); TRANSFER (for transferring the contents of one reactor to a next reactor); REACT (seals the reactor vessel to underside of disposable cartridge and heats); PROMPT (pauses sequence run and prompts the user); INSTALL (moves a reactor to the install position for reaction vessel removal and/or installation and prompts the user); TRAPF18 (traps [18F]Fluoride on a quaternary methylammonium (QMA) cartridge); ELUTEF18 (uses a reagent to elute [18F]Fluoride off a QMA cartridge); MIX (mixes the contents of a reactor by stirring); EXTERNALADD (allows the user to externally add a reagent via tubing); TRANSFERTOHPLC (transfers the contents of the reactor to the HPLC injection loop); MEASURERADIATION (measures the radiation levels observed in the reactor).",
                        "FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary display 18 that can be displayed on a client device 16 that displays relevant information as to the current unit operation occurring during a synthesis run. In this particular example, [18F] FDG is being synthesized in reactor #1. The display includes an active video 20 of rector #1. The system status 22 indicates the current operation being conducted by the synthesizer 12 (e.g., moving reactor #1). A sequencer 24 lists the unit operations in the order in which they are to be performed. Unit operations are performed in a serial fashion moving from one unit operation to the next. The current unit operation 25 is highlighted as illustrated in FIG. 2 (e.g., ADD). The user may be permitted to abort a particular run using abort button 26.",
                        "FIG. 3 illustrates an overview of the software architecture used as part of the interface between the client devices 16 and the control system 14 according to one embodiment. A server 30 interfaces with the client devices 16 using standard networking protocols to maximize the ability of client-server communication to pass through firewalls. Secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) is used to transmit all information with the exception of video which is sent using Adobe's real-time messaging protocol (RTMP). The server 30 is responsible for the actual execution of the synthesis program and is designed and built with maximum reliability in mind To this end, open-source packages with known reliability have been used. Additionally, all information about the state of each client application is stored on the server, so nothing will be lost even if a critical failure (e.g., battery loss and software crash) occurs with the client device 16. The server 30 is driven by the client device 16 but acts independently once the production run has started to make the system resilient to intermittent network connectivity or failures of the client device 16. The server 30 is composed of five main applications. A first main application includes the Web Server 32; An Apache HTTP (Forest Hill, Md., USA) is responsible for all client communication except video. A module written in Python (Wilmington, Del., USA) handles viewing and editing programs and only communicates with the core server for operations related to production runs.",
                        "A second application includes a Core Server 34. An application written in Python runs on the Core Server 34 and is responsible for running a program and communicating with a computer 164 or programmable logic controller (PLC) 166 located in the radiosynthesizer 12 that monitors and controls the state of the hardware. The computer 164 or PLC 166 constitutes the third tier of the software. The core server code has been separated from the web server to remove the overhead of program viewing and editing and to insulate it from any failures that might occur while processing client requests. All communications between the web and core servers are accomplished using remote procedure calls.",
                        "A third application includes the database (MySQL) server 36. All synthesis programs and user information as well as the complete production run history are stored in a MySQL database (Redwood City, Calif., USA), a widely used, reliable, open-source relational database. A fourth application includes a video server 38. Three live video feeds (one for each reactor) from the respective cameras at each reactor assembly are generated by a hardware encoder within the synthesizer 12 as real-time streaming protocol streams and are converted to the Flash-compatible format RTMP by C++ RTMP Server (e.g., EvoStream (San Diego, Calif., USA) and published for simultaneous consumption by multiple client devices.",
                        "A fourth application includes a command line interface 40. A terminal-based command line interface 40 provides a way to monitor the status of all hardware components and offers a mechanism to control the system directly at a low level. Although not needed by or intended for end users, this application is useful for software developers and maintenance technicians.",
                        "Returning back to FIG. 1 and to FIGS. 4A-4D the synthesizer 12 includes several main subsystems that are used to carry out the various radiosynthesis operations. A first main subsystem includes a plurality of reactor assemblies 50. The reactor assemblies 50 are used to hold a reactor vial 52 (e.g., 5 mL glass V-vial) within a central aperture 54. Each reactor vial 52 is configured to hold reagents, precursors, and products generated during the radiosynthesis operations. In the illustrated embodiments there are three such reactor assemblies 50 (e.g., reactor #1, reactor #2, and reactor #3 in FIG. 1). While three such reactor assemblies 50 are illustrated, there could be more or less depending on the particular synthesis. Further, even in a configuration with three (3) reactor assemblies such as that illustrated only one or two reactor assemblies 50 could be utilized in any particular run. In some embodiments, the reactor vial 52 is open at the upper lip or rim. In other embodiments, however, the reactor vial 52 may be sealed with a septum which is penetrated by needles located on the underside of cassettes 80.",
                        "Each reactor assembly 50 includes a plurality of spring-biased heating assemblies 56. Three such spring-biased heating assemblies 56 are shown in the illustrated embodiments. The spring-biased heating assemblies 56 use respective springs to press the heating assembly radially inward against the surface of the reactor vial 52 when placed therein. In this regard, the spring-biased heating assemblies 56 act as a three-segment spring-loaded \u201cchuck.\u201d Each spring-biased heating assembly 56 presses firmly against the reactor vial 52 to ensure excellent thermal contact and thus efficient heat exchange between the reactor assembly 50 and the reactor vial 52. Each spring-biased heating assembly 56 includes a 100 W cartridge heater 58 (CIR-1021-120V-100 W-ST-A, Valin; San Jose, Calif., USA) and a K-type thermocouple 60 (HTTC72-K-116U-1.25-UNGR, Omega Engineering; Stamford, Conn., USA) for individual feedback control of the reactor assembly temperature up to 185\u00b0 C. Since a very similar temperature response was typically observed in all three segments, the reactor assembly temperature at any given moment is considered equal to the average of the three temperature readings from the thermocouples. Active liquid cooling is achieved by pumping room temperature coolant (propylene/ethylene glycol and water mixture) through cooling channels 62 in all three reactors in series by a liquid pump (8030-863-236, Steam Brite; San Antonio, Tex., USA) and then through a radiator 174 with three 140 mm fans (HX-CU1403V, Frozen CPU; East Rochester, N.Y., USA) (pump and radiator illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9).",
                        "The reactor assembly 50 further includes a camera 64 (PC213XS, Super Circuits; Austin, Tex., USA) affixed to a mount 66. The camera 64 was mounted behind the reactor assembly 50, which is helpful for monitoring liquid levels during evaporations, to observe visual cues for reaction progression, to confirm reagent additions and transfers, and for visual inspection of the eluate post purification. The camera 64 is oriented relative to the spring-biased heating assembly 56 such that it has a clear view of the reactor vial 52. In one embodiment, as best seen in FIG. 4D, portions of the spring-biased heating assembly 56 may have optional graduation marks 57 in the form of collets to gauge liquid volume in the reactor vial 52 (visible to camera 64).",
                        "Still referring to FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4D, each reactor assembly 50 includes a plurality of vertically-oriented actuators 70 that are mounted at one end (bottom) to a horizontally-oriented actuator 72. The opposing end of the vertically-oriented actuators are mounted to the reactor assembly 50 that that the entire reactor assembly 50 can be raised and lowered depending on actuator of the vertically-oriented actuators 70. In one aspect, there are four (4) such vertically-oriented actuators 70 with each actuator being a pneumatic actuator that is coupled to a source of valved, pressurized gas. When pressurized gas is delivered to the vertically-oriented actuators 70 the reactor assembly 50 is raised in the vertical direction so as to place the reactor vial 52 therein in a sealed configuration against gaskets 90 positioned on the bottom surface of disposable cassettes positioned directly above each reactor assembly 50 (described in more detail below). Also, as described above, the horizontally-oriented actuator 72 is able to move the reactor assembly 50 in the lateral direction. This two axis movement by the reactor assembly 50 permits the reactor vial 52 to be selectively and dynamically configured for different unit operations based on the particular gasket 90 that it interfaces with on the underside of the disposable cassette (described below).",
                        "For example, in one position, the gasket 90 is un-sealed within internal plumbing or fluid paths within a disposable cassette 80 configured to deliver reagents to the reactor vial 52 within the reactor assembly 50. In another position, the gasket 90 is sealed, allowing for a reaction under sealed conditions. Permanent tubing and valve connections to the reaction vessel are the root cause of the reaction pressure limitations of most synthesizers. The ability to move the reactor vial 52 to a dedicated sealed reaction position eliminates these limitations and enables compatibility with higher pressures. To ensure reliable operation, the position of the reactor assembly 50 is monitored via feedback from the linear actuator and the raised or lowered state is detected with Hall effect sensors (D-M9NWL, SMC Corporation; Noblesville, Ind., USA).",

The reactor assembly 50 and reactor vial 52 are raised to contact the upper lip or rim of the reactor vial to the un-sealed gasket 90d. Radioisotope such as [18F]fluoride obtained from a cyclotron or vial is input into the cassette 80 via the inlet tubing port 122. In nucleophilic fluorine-18 radiochemistry, [18F]fluoride is trapped on a strong anion exchange resin such as quaternary methylammonium (QMA) resin for purification and recovery of [18O]H2O and released in a solution with lower water content to reduce the time needed for drying. This is accomplished using a cassette 80 that is coupled to a QMA cartridge 132 via Luer fittings between tubes coming from the cassette 80. If an external vial is used, an external inert gas delivery line coupled to an inert gas port 114 is available to pressurize the vial for delivery on demand. Alternatively, the gas delivery system of the cyclotron can be used to directly push the [18F]fluoride into the system. In FIG. 6G, this flow is valved using stopcock valve 102 to a purification the QMA cartridge 132. During trapping, the [18F]fluoride source solution flows through the QMA cartridge 132 where [18F]fluoride is retained and the carrier [18O]H2O, then flows into the recovery vial 118 in the cassette 80. During elution, stopcock valve 102 positions are switched and the gas handling robot drives the eluent from the eluent addition position of the cassette 80 through the QMA cartridge 132 and into the reactor vial 52. Multiple elutions can be performed to increase efficiency of [18F]fluoride collection. PEEK tubing can be used for all fluid paths involving [18F]fluoride to maximize specific activity.

In other systems, sensitive reagents may be compromised because the reagents are placed onto needles during setup (prior to starting the synthesis), or are transferred during setup from their original vials into reservoirs that are a permanent part of the synthesizer 12. The reagent and gas handling robot 140 approach helps to eliminate the need to reconfigure the plumbing for different synthesis protocols (i.e., the choice of which reagents are \u201cconnected\u201d to which reaction vial 52 is made not by the plumbing configuration but is simply specified in software). The reagent and gas handling robot 140 is also used for forming connections of inert gas and vacuum to the inert gas port 114 and vacuum port 120, respectively.

The required time for addition of a reagent is generally determined by repeatedly measuring the time needed for complete transfer of the desired liquid and volume at the desired pressure, taking the maximum value, and multiplying by a safety factor. The entire contents of the reagent vial 84 are delivered at once. After addition is complete, the vial gripper 158 lifts the empty reagent vial 84, the gas manifold 152 disengages, and the vial 84 is returned to its original storage position. FIG. 10A shows a summarized view of each step that makes up the operation of material addition. Like all fluidic systems, there are losses associated with dead volumes during liquid transfers. Initial characterization revealed that 120 \u03bcL\u00b120 \u03bcL (n=120) of the liquid remains in the reagent vial after addition. To account for this loss, additional reagent can be loaded into the crimped vials. FIG. 10B illustrates a summarized view of a flow diagram showing the sequence of low level steps required to evaporate the contents of the first reactor vial 52.",
                        "Reactions",
                        "To maintain high internal pressure, the reaction vial 52 is sealed by firmly pressing upward against the gasket 90 on the bottom of the cassette. Each cassette 80 has two independent reaction positions at gaskets 90b, 90c to support up to two separate sealed reactions in each reaction vial 42. To characterize the seal integrity, \u02dc1 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile was sealed and heated at 165\u00b0 C. for one hour. In all experiments, <14 \u03bcL of volume was lost (<1.5%). However, it is believe the actual loss of vapor to be less because small droplets of solvent were observed on the gasket surface and were therefore not included in the measured content of the reaction vessel after the integrity test.",
                        "Using a hypodermic needle thermocouple (HN-7-K-TEF, J-KEM Scientific; Saint Louis, Mo., USA) pierced through the gasket, the internal liquid temperature of the reaction vial 52 contents for the automated synthesizer 10 was compared with that and obtained when using the same vessel in a traditional pre-heated oil bath. The comparison of internal liquid temperatures was performed as follows. The reaction vessel was filled with \u02dc1 mL of acetonitrile with a hypodermic thermocouple tip submerged in the liquid. For the automated synthesizer 10 test, the reactor assembly 50 was heated to 160\u00b0 C., sealed against a modified cassette with protruding thermocouple and held at temperature for 15 min. For the oil bath test, the reaction vessel was sealed with a silicone stopper pierced with the thermocouple and placed in the preheated 160\u00b0 C. oil bath for 15 min. Active cooling was used for the automated synthesizer 10 and passive ambient air cooling was used for the oil bath, as is conventional for most oil bath heated systems. As FIG. 11 shows, ramping time for heating the solvent is comparable. Both temperatures stabilize at a temperature slightly lower than the set point. This is normal in all radiosynthesizers if the set point is above the solvent boiling point, with the difference depending on the unique thermal characteristics (i.e. heat sources and heat sinks) of the system. Also shown in FIG. 11, the automated synthesizer 10 cools the solvent much faster than simply removing the vessel from the oil bath. If compressed-air cooling is used, the cooling rate is intermediate between these rates (data not shown). It was found that the heating rates and internal liquid temperature are comparable, but the active liquid cooling of the automated synthesizer 10 results in a more rapid decrease in temperature after heating.",
                        "After reagents are loaded into the reaction vial 52, a reaction can be performed by sealing the reaction vial 52 against a sealing positions on the gaskets 90b, 90c of the cassette 80. The reactor assembly 50 is then heated to the desired temperature, with optional stirring using motor 67. Once the desired elevated temperature is reached, heating and stirring are continued for the desired reaction time. After this time elapses, the heaters 58 are turned off and the cooling pump is activated until the desired reduced temperature is reached.",
                        "Evaporations",
                        "Evaporation of solvents occurs by sealing the reaction vial 52 against the gasket 90a of the cassette 80 at the evaporate position. The reaction vial 52 is heated with the option of stirring, and the gas manifold 152 provides both vacuum (to remove vapor) and inert gas (to assist with vapor removal) through the ports (vacuum port 120 and inert gas port 114) on the cassette 80. The required time for evaporation is generally determined by measuring the maximum time needed for complete evaporation of solvent from the desired mixture, and multiplying by a safety factor. After the desired evaporation time, the reactor is cooled.",
                        "Transfer and Purification",
                        "Sep-Pak\u2122 purification cartridges 132, e.g. silica, C18, etc., are connected to designated Luer\u00ae fittings on the cassette 80. A dip tube 106 (e.g., made of \u215b\u2033 OD Teflon\u00ae tubing) is built into the cassette 80 to act as the fluid path for the transfer of crude products. The transfer unit operation begins with the reactor vial 52 sealing against the transfer position on the cassette 80. The gas manifold 152 being moved by the reagent and gas handling robot 140 provides inert gas to pressurize the reactor vial 52. This moves the fluid through the dip tube 106 and to the Sep-Pak\u2122 purification cartridge 132. After the purification cartridge 132, a dedicated stopcock valve 102 in the cassette 80 switches between a fluid path towards a waste collection vial 116 installed on the cassette 80 and a tube that can be plumbed to the input of the next cassette 80. Often, the first step is to trap the crude product onto the purification cartridge 132 (e.g., Sep-Pak\u2122) and allow the residual solution to collect in the waste container 116. The stopcock position is switched, and elution of the desired product into the next reactor vial 52 is then performed by adding the elution solvent to the first reactor vial 50 and repeating the transfer unit operation to elute the product from the cassette 80.",

Anhydrous grade acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, toluene, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, methanol, hexane, 4,7,13,16,21,24-Hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (Kryptofix K222), potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, ammonium phosphate monobasic, ammonium acetate, sodium methoxide in methanol, and 33% hydrobromic acid in acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis., USA). 1N hydrochloric acid was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa., USA). QMA (WAT023525) and silica cartridges (WAT020520 and WAT043400) were purchased from Waters (Milford, Mass., USA). The QMA cartridge was preconditioned with 10 mL of 1M potassium bicarbonate followed by 10 mL of 0.1 nm filtered 18M\u03a9 water, and the silica cartridges were preconditioned with 10 mL of anhydrous hexane. Precursors for both D-[18F]FAC and L-[18F]FMAU (i.e. 2-O-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-1,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-alpha-D-ribofuranose, 2-O-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-1,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-alpha-L-ribofuranose, bis (tri-methylsilyl)cytosine, and 5-methyl-2,4-bis[(trimethylsilyl)oxy]pyrimidine were obtained from ABX (Advanced Biochemical Compounds; Radeberg, Germany) 200-proof ethanol was obtained from the UCLA Chemistry Department (Los Angeles, Calif., USA). All reagents were used as received.",
                        "Synthesis Protocol",
                        "Synthesis protocols for D-[18F]FAC and L-[18F]FMAU as seen in FIG. 12 were nearly identical, differing only in precursors and HPLC mobile phases, and were programmed using the drag-and-drop software interface of the automated synthesizer 10 (ELIXYS automated radiochemistry synthesizer by Sofie Biosciences, Culver City, Calif.). A summary of the reagents and unit operations used to synthesize the tracers can be found in Tables 2 and 3 below. Upon completion of each synthesis, the crude product was purified by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the desired product (beta form, structures f and l in FIG. 12) was collected and a sample taken for verification and specific activity analysis by analytical HPLC.",
                        "Semi-preparative HPLC was performed with a WellChrom K-501 HPLC pump (5 mL/min, Knauer; Berlin, Germany), reversed-phase Gemini-NX column (5 \u03bcm, 10\u00d7250 mm, Phenomenex; Torrance, Calif., USA), UV detector (254 nm, WellChrom Spectro-Photometer K-2501, Knauer) and gamma-radiation detector and counter (B-FC-3300 and B-FC-1000; Bioscan Inc.; Washington, D.C., USA). The mobile phase for D-[18F]FAC was 1% ethanol in 10 mM ammonium phosphate monobasic, and 4% acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium acetate was used for L-[18F]FMAU. Analytical HPLC was done on a Knauer Smartline HPLC system (1 mL/min) with a Phenomenex reverse-phase Luna column (5 \u03bcm, 4.6\u00d7250 mm) with in-line Knauer UV (254 nm) and gamma-radiation coincidence detector and counter (B-FC-4100 and B-FC-1000). The analytical HPLC mobile phase was 10% ethanol in 50 mM ammonium acetate for D-[18F]FAC and 10% acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium acetate for L-[18F]FMAU. All chromatograms were collected by a GINAstar (Raytest USA, Inc.; Wilmington, N.C., USA) analog to digital converter and GINAstar software (Raytest USA, Inc.) running on a PC.",
                        "Results and Discussion",
                        "To validate the functionality of the automated synthesizer 10, the three-pot syntheses of D-[18F]FAC and L-[18F]FMAU were performed. Decay corrected radiochemical yield (RCY, d.c.), duration of synthesis, and specific activity are listed Table 4 below.",
                        "The automated synthesizer 10 produces comparable decay corrected radiochemical yields but with shorter synthesis times (e.g., \u02dc1 hr shorter). Furthermore, the synthesis time of the three-pot synthesis on the automated synthesizer 10 is similar to the one-pot approach reported by others, but the yield on automated synthesizer 10 is substantially higher. Products were confirmed by analytical HPLC, and radiochemical purity was found to be >99% for both tracers. In addition to D-[18F]FAC and L-[18F]FMAU, the disposable cassette approach allowed for multiple other tracers to be readily synthesized, such as 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), 3-deoxy-3-[18F]fluoro-L-thymidine ([18F]FLT), (S)\u2014N-[(1-allyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-5-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-2, 3-dimethoxybenzamide ([18F]fallypride), 9-(4-(18)F-Fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)guanine ([18F]FHBG), and N-succinimidyl-4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB) by switching cassettes 80 and software programs. No hardware or plumbing changes were needed between productions of different tracers. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that the procedures set forth herein are not limited to the specific enumerated reaction and are broadly applicable to preparation of radiosynthesis of a broad range of compounds.",
