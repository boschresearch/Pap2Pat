# DESCRIPTION

## GOVERNMENT FUNDING

This invention was made with government support under GM119186 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

## BACKGROUND

AAV-based gene therapy is currently being tested in about 50 clinical trials, and two AAV-based drugs have been approved by US FDA. But preexisting neutralizing antibodies to commonly-used AAV serotypes in patients limit the patient population that can benefit from the treatments. However, determining which patients have levels of preexisting neutralizing antibodies that would preclude treatment has proved challenging at least in part because several of the AAV serotypes useful for gene therapy are not infectious in vitro under normal conditions.

A reliable diagnostic to evaluate a patient's AAV seropositivity would be useful to assist in providing patients with effective AAV-mediated therapeutics.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This disclosure describes the discovery that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, dorsomorphin (also referred to herein as “Compound C” or “CC”), increases the infectivity of the most commonly used adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes in several different cell lines. This increased infectivity allows commonly used cell lines, including HEK293 cells, to be used to evaluate the presence and activity of neutralizing antibodies to AAV in a patient.

This disclosure further describes methods for using dorsomorphin-treated cells to determine neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers.

In one aspect, this disclosure describes a method that includes infecting a cell with adeno-associated virus (AAV) in the presence of dorsomorphin.

In some embodiments, the cell comprises a cell of a cell line. Exemplary cell lines include HEK293, HeLa, C2C12, Huh7, B16F10, or PC3.

In some embodiments, the AAV includes AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV10, AAV Anc80L65, or AAVKLK. In some embodiments, the AAV includes an AAV vector. The AAV vector may include a reporter gene. An exemplary reporter gene is a gene that expresses luciferase.

In some embodiments, dorsomorphin is added at least 10 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 40 minutes, at least 50 minutes, at least 60 minutes, at least 90 minutes, or at least 120 minutes prior to the addition of AAV; and/or dorsomorphin is added up to 30 minutes, up to 40 minutes, up to 50 minutes, up to 60 minutes, up to 90 minutes, up to 120 minutes, up to 180 minutes prior to the addition of AAV.

In some embodiments, the method includes infecting the cell with AAV in the presence of IL-6 or TNFα or both.

In some embodiments, the method includes adding a composition to the dorsomorphin-treated cell at the time of infecting the cell with AAV, wherein the composition includes a composition known to comprise a neutralizing antibody (NAb) to AAV; or a composition being tested for the presence of a NAb to AAV. In some embodiments, the composition comprises serum including, for example, serum from a human or an animal. In some embodiments, the method includes adding multiple dilutions of the composition to dorsomorphin-treated cells at the time of infecting the cell with AAV.

In some embodiments, the method includes determining an NAb titer.

In some embodiments, the method includes measuring the level of the reporter gene expressed by the cell. In an exemplary embodiment, the reporter gene includes luciferase.

In some embodiments, the method includes adding multiple dilutions of the composition to dorsomorphin-treated cells at the time of infecting the cell with AAV, and determining the dilution at which 50% or greater inhibition of a reporter gene is observed.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS

### AAV in Gene Therapy

AAV is widely recognized as a safe and effective clinical-stage vector for gene therapy in a broad spectrum of inherited diseases such as Leber's congenital amaurosis, hemophilia A and B, and muscular dystrophy. For example, AAV-based treatments have been approved by the US FDA for use in two gene therapies: for a rare eye disease and for spinal muscular atrophy.

### AAV-Capsid-Specific Neutralizing Antibodies

AAV seropositivity of the general patient population due to natural virus infection and the presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in patients to commonly-used AAV serotypes limits the cohort of successful recipients of novel therapies.

Numerous attempts have been made to identify or develop novel AAV serotypes that can avoid neutralization. But even if an AAV capsid variants avoids neutralization in animal models, additional pre-clinical evaluation is required prior to use for human applications.

### Methods for Evaluating the Presence and Activity of Neutralizing Antibodies to AAV at the Time of the Invention

Several methods for determining neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer have been published, including an ELISA-based method (Nathwani et al., Blood 100:1662-1669 (2002)), a qPCR-based method for evaluating AAV binding to a cell (Guo et al., Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev 13:40-46 (2019)), a method that involves in vivo inhibition of AAV activity by injection of a test sample into C57BL/6 mice (Wang et al., Gene Ther 22:984-992 (2015)), a method that compares reporter gene activity delivered by AAV in the presence and absence of serum containing NAb (Falese et al., Gene Ther 24:768-778 (2017); Markusic et al., J Transl Med 15:94 (2017); and Meliani et al., Hum Gene Ther Methods 26:45-53 (2015)).

Some of the existing methods, such as measurements of NAb activity using mice, are time consuming and hard to standardize. Assays based on in vitro infection of cells with AAV-encoded reporter genes are more attractive because they are easier to establish and reproduce. However, no single cell line may be used for all commonly used AAV serotypes. Nor has a reporter gene with sufficient sensitivity to detect reliable differences between evaluated serum samples been identified.

For example, AAV8 is a highly efficient serotype for delivery of a transgene to the liver in vivo; however, AAV8—like AAV7, AAV9, and AAV10—exhibits low to no infectivity of cells in vitro. Infection of cells in cell culture, if possible at all, requires a very high multiplicity of infection (MOI).

In another example, although AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, and AAV6 infect cell in vitro, each requires a different cell line.

To address the limitation that no single cell line may be used for all commonly used AAV serotypes, a number of cell lines have been used (for example, HEK293, HeLa, Huh7, C2C12, etc.) for different AAV serotypes, a wide range of AAV MOIs are used, and a large selection of pharmacological drugs have been tested in an attempt to significantly enhance the transduction of AAV serotypes in vitro.

In some instances, a helper virus, such as adenovirus, has also been used to increase expression in AAV transduced cells. Alternatively, one non-commercially available cell line is made permissive for AAV infection by expressing the adenovirus E4 ORF gene under the control of the ecdysone-inducible promoter and ponasterone A (Meliani et al., Hum Gene Ther Methods 26:45-53 (2015)).

### Methods of Using Dorsomorphin to Increase AAV Infectivity

In one aspect, this disclosure describes a method that includes using dorsomorphin (also referred to herein as “Compound C” or “CC”) to increase the infectivity of adeno-associated virus (AAV).

As further described in the Examples, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, dorsomorphin, increases the infectivity of the most commonly used adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes in several different cell lines. This increased infectivity allows commonly used cell lines, including HEK293 cells, to be used to evaluate the presence and activity of neutralizing antibodies to AAV in a patient.

The method may include infecting any suitable cell with AAV in the presence of dorsomorphin. The cell may include, for example, a cell of a cell line. Exemplary cell lines include HEK293, HeLa, C2C12, Huh7, B16F10, PC3, etc. In some embodiments, the cell may preferably include a cell from the HEK293 cell line.

The AAV may include any AAV serotype. In some embodiments, the AAV is preferably an AAV serotype useful for a pre-clinical or clinical application. In some embodiments, the AAV may include AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV10, AAV Anc80L65, or AAVKLK, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the AAV may include a sialic acid (SIA) binder (including, for example, AAV1, AAV4, AAV5, or AAV6). In some embodiments, the AAV may include a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binder (including, for example, AAV2, AAV3, AAV6, or AAV13). In some embodiments, the AAV may include a galactose binder (including, for example, AAV9). In some embodiments, the AAV may be derived from a recombinant library and/or a machine learning algorithm (e.g., as described in Kotterman et al., Nat Rev Genet 15:445-451 (2014); Paulk et al., Mol Ther 26:289-303 (2018); Ogden et al., Science 366:1139-1143 (2019); or Havlik et al., J Virol. 15; 94(19):e00976-20 (2020)), rationally designed to introduce one or more point mutations (e.g., as described in Zhong et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105(22):7827-7832 (2008); Markusic et al., Mol Ther. 18(12):2048-2056 (2010); Pandya et al., Immunol Cell Biol. 92(2):116-23 (2014); or Kay et al., PLoS One 8(4):e62097 (2013)), designed to possess a ligand or peptide insert (e.g., as described in Warrington et al., J Virol 78:6595-6609 (2004); Judd et al., Mol Ther Nucleic Acids 1:e54 (2012); or Sayroo et al., Gene Ther 23:18-25 (2016)), or isolated form different species (e.g., as described in Yates et al., Infect Immun 7(6):973-80 (1973) or Farkas et al J Gen Virology 85(3): 555-561(2004)).

In some embodiments, the AAV is preferably an AAV vector. In some embodiments, the AAV vector further includes a reporter gene. In some embodiments, the reporter gene preferably includes a gene that expresses luciferase. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, as described in the Examples, the AAV vector may express firefly luciferase (Luc) under the control of a promoter. Other exemplary reporter genes include, for example, genes that express GFP, YFP, mCherry, mApple, RFP, LacZ, creatine kinase, aequorin, Renilla luciferase, NANOLUC luciferase (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.), Gaussia luciferase, luciferin (foxfire), etc. Exemplary suitable promoters include, but are not limited to, chicken β actin promoter, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoter, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, or a synthetic promoter (e.g., the CAG promoter).

In some embodiments, the method may include infecting a cell with AAV at a minimum multiplicity of infection (MOI) of at least 10 viral genomes (vg)/cell such as, for example, at least 50 vg/cell, at least 100 vg/cell, at least 200 vg/cell, at least 300 vg/cell, at least 400 vg/cell, at least 500 vg/cell or at least 1000, vg/cell. In some embodiments, the method may include infection a cell with AAV at a maximum MOI of no more than 500,000 vg/cell such as, for example, no more than 250,000 vg/cell, no more than 100,000 vg/cell, no more than 50,000 vg/cell, no more than 25,000 vg/cell, no more than 10,000 vg/cell, no more than 5,000 vg/cell, no more than 2,000 vg/cell, or no more than 1,000 vg/cell. The MOI is said to be “no more than” a reference MOI value when the MOI has a non-zero value up to the reference value.

The MOI also can be characterized by a range having endpoints defined by any a minimum MOI identified above and any maximum MOI identified above that is greater than the selected minimum MOI. For example, in some embodiments, the method may include infecting a cell with AAV at an MOI of from 100 to 5,000, from 200 to 2,000, from 100 to 10,000, from 1,000 to 5,000, from 1,000 to 2,000, etc.

In some embodiments, dorsomorphin may be added to the cell to be infected prior to the addition of AAV. For example, dorsomorphin may be added at least 10 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 40 minutes, at least 50 minutes, at least 60 minutes, at least 90 minutes, or at least 120 minutes prior to the addition of AAV. In some embodiments, dorsomorphin may be added up to 30 minutes, up to 40 minutes, up to 50 minutes, up to 60 minutes, up to 90 minutes, up to 120 minutes, up to 180 minutes prior to the addition of AAV. In an exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin is added at least 30 minutes and up to 90 minutes prior to the addition of AAV. In another exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin is added 60 minutes and prior to the addition of AAV.

In some embodiments, dorsomorphin may be added to the cell to be infected prior to the addition of AAV at a concentration of at least 0.5 μM, at least 1 μM, at least 1.5 μM, at least 2 μM, at least 2.5 μM, at least 3 μM, at least 4 μM, at least 5 μM, at least 6 μM, at least 8 μM, at least 10 μM, or at least 15 μM. In some embodiments, dorsomorphin may be added to the cell to be infected prior to the addition of AAV at a concentration of at up to 4 μM, up to 6 μM, up to 8 μM, up to 10 μM, up to 15 μM, up to 20 μM, or up to 30 μM. In an exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin may be added to the cell to be infected prior to the addition of AAV at a concentration of at least 2.5 μM and up to 20 μM. In at least one model system, a statistically significant increase in activity of AAV/Luc was observed when cells were pretreated with a CC concentration of at least 2.5 μM at concentrations higher than 20 μM CC became toxic to cells. In another exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin may be added to the cell to be infected prior to the addition of AAV at a concentration of at least 5 μM and up to 15 μM. In a further exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin may be added to the cell to be infected prior to the addition of AAV at a concentration of 10 μM.

In some embodiments, dorsomorphin may be present at the time the cell is infected with AAV at a concentration of at least 0.5 μM, at least 1 μM, at least 2 μM, at least 3 μM, at least 4 μM, at least 5 μM, at least 6 μM, at least 8 μM, at least 10 μM, or at least 15 μM.

In an exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin may be present at the time the cell is infected with AAV at a concentration of at least 5 μM and up to 15 μM. In another exemplary embodiment, dorsomorphin may be present at the time the cell is infected with AAV at a concentration of 10 μM.

In some embodiments, an additional active agent may be added to the cell to be infected in addition to AAV. Exemplary additional active agents include IL-6 or TNFα or both. If included, the additional active agent may be used in any suitable amount. An additional active agent may be added at the same time as dorsomorphin or at a different time than dorsomorphin. For example, the additional active agent may be added at least 10 minutes, at least 20 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 40 minutes, at least 50 minutes, at least 60 minutes, at least 90 minutes, or at least 120 minutes prior to the addition of AAV. In some embodiments, the additional active agent may be added up to 30 minutes, up to 40 minutes, up to 50 minutes, up to 60 minutes, up to 90 minutes, up to 120 minutes, up to 180 minutes prior to the addition of AAV. In some embodiments, the additional active agent may be added at the same time as AAV.

In an exemplary embodiment, when the additional active agent includes IL-6, at least 5 ng/mL IL-6, at least 10 ng/mL IL-6, at least 15 ng/mL IL-6, or at least 20 ng/mL IL-6 may be added and/or up to 10 ng/mL IL-6, up to 15 ng/mL IL-6, up to 20 ng/mL IL-6, or up to 25 ng/mL IL-6 may be added.

In another exemplary embodiment, 20 ng/mL TNFα may be added.

In yet another exemplary embodiment, 20 ng/mL IL-6 and 20 ng/mL TNFα may be added.

### Methods of Using Dorsomorphin-Treated Cells in a Neutralizing Antibody Assay

This disclosure further describes methods for using a dorsomorphin-treated cell to determine the presence of a neutralizing antibody (NAb). In some embodiments, determining the presence of a neutralizing antibody includes determining a neutralizing antibody titer.

In an exemplary embodiment, the method includes adding a composition to the dorsomorphin-treated cell at the time of infecting the cell with AAV. The composition may include a composition known to include a NAb to AAV or a composition being tested for the presence of a NAb to AAV.

In some embodiments, the composition includes serum. The serum may be from a human or an animal. Exemplary animals include research animals such as humans, rat, mice, pigs, dogs, horses, etc. Canines are commonly used as a pre-clinical model for evaluating safety and efficacy of AAV-based drugs. AAV-based gene therapy treatments for hemophilia, muscular dystrophies, and vision have used dogs in preclinical studies prior to human use. Non-human primates (NHPs) are another common pre-clinical animal model for evaluating safety and efficacy of AAV-based drugs. Non-human primates are the closest genetic relatives to humans and possess similarities to humans in anatomy, cell physiology, and immunology.

In some embodiments, a composition that includes an AAV neutralizing antibody may include serum. The serum may be from a human or an animal known to be infected with AAV, including, for example, a human or an animal known to be infected with a particular AAV serotype.

In some embodiments, a composition being tested for the presence of a NAb to AAV may include serum from a patient. An exemplary patient is a person identified as likely to benefit from a particular AAV-based gene therapy. When the AAV-based gene therapy includes a particular AAV serotype, the patient's serum may be tested for the presence of NAb specific to that AAV serotype.

In some embodiments, including, for example, when determining an NAb titer is desired, a range of dilutions of the composition may be added dorsomorphin-treated cells at the time of infecting the cell with AAV.

In some embodiments, when the AAV vector further includes a reporter gene, a method for determining an NAb titer includes measuring the level of the reporter gene expressed by the cell. In some embodiments, the level of the reporter gene may be measured at least 6 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 18 hours, at least 24 hours, at least 30 hours, at least 36 hours, at least 42 hours, or at least 48 hours after infection of the cell with AAV. In some embodiments, the level of the reporter gene may be measured up to 12 hours, up to 18 hours, up to 24 hours, up to 30 hours, up to 36 hours, up to 42 hours, up to 48 hours, or up to 72 hours after infection of the cell with AAV. Increased incubation time (for example, to at least 48 hours) may be particularly beneficial for hard-to infect serotypes such as AAV3, AAV5, AAV10, or AAV8.

In an exemplary embodiment, as described in Example 2, the NAb titer of the composition may be determined by ascertaining the first dilution at which 50% or greater inhibition of the reporter gene is observed.

In another exemplary embodiment, also described in Example 2, the NAb titer may be quantified using GraphPad Prizm or any other suitable software from an inhibition exhibiting well-defined plateaus at minimum and maximum dilutions of the composition.

The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. It is to be understood that the particular examples, materials, amounts, and procedures are to be interpreted broadly in accordance with the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth herein.

## EXAMPLES

All reagents, starting materials, and solvents used in the following examples were purchased from commercial suppliers (such as Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated.

### Example 1

AAV8-Luciferase (Luc) or AAV2-Luc contain a single-strain expression cassette with chicken-b-actin promoter (CB)-driven fusion of firefly luciferase (Luc) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes (Pandya et al., J Immunother 38:292-298 (2015); Sayroo et al., Gene Ther 23: 18-25 (2016)).

HEK293 cells were infected with AAV8-Luciferase (Luc) or AAV2-Luc at an MOI of 5000 in the presence of several pharmacologically active drugs (TNFα+LPS, TNFα+IL-6, dorsomorphin (also known as “Compound C” or “CC”), SP600125, or rosiglitazone). The drugs were added 1 hour before injection with AAV-Luc. 24 hours after AAV-Luc was added, luciferase was detected, as further described in Example 2.

Results are shown in FIG. 1A-FIG. 1B and FIG. 6A-6D.

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, dorsomorphin, significantly enhanced the infection of HEK293 by AAV2 and AAV8 without cytotoxic effects.

### Example 2

This Example describes a method for measuring of the titer in serum (from a subject—including, for example, from a mouse) of a neutralizing antibody (NAb) to an particular AAV serotype.

**Day 0:**

1. Remove culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) from HEK293 cell culture, gently wash cells twice with 100 μL of PBS. Cells should be at low passage and approximately 80% confluent without being overgrown. Harvest cells by trypsinization and perform a cell count.

2. Resuspend cells in complete DMEM culture medium at 200,000 cells/mL. Seed cells in 96-well plates with black or white walls and clear bottoms: 20,000 cells/well in 100 μL of complete media.

3. Incubate cells overnight in C02 incubator at 37° C.

**Day 1:**

1. Confirm microscopically that cells are 50-80% confluent.

2. Activate cells by adding 50 μL/well of warmed (37° C.) serum-free DMEM containing 30 μM CC (final concentration of CC: 10 μM).

3. Incubate in CO2 incubator at 37° C. for one hour.

4. Prepare serial dilutions of test samples (for example, mouse or human serum) using HI-FBS as the diluent in a U-bottomed or V-bottomed 96-well plate. An exemplary dilution strategy is provided in Table 1.

4. Prepare a working solution of AAV. First, calculate the working concentration of AAV which is based on number of cells in well and multiplicity of infection (MOI) will be used.

For example, if on the day of infection cells are 50% confluent (assuming that 100% confluence consists of 50,000 cells/well) then in each well will be added AAV/Luc at MOI=2000 vg/well in 5 μl, the working virus concentration is calculated by following:

50,000*(% confluence/100)*MOI*(1000 μl/5 μl)=vg/ml

50,000*(50/100)*2,000*200=1×1010 vg/ml−working concentration of AAV/Luc

For the whole 96-well plate, 800 μl of AAV/Luc plus extra is needed (if to mix 25 μl of AAV for each sample in triplicate, then 96 wells/3*25 μl=800 μl).

If the stock of AAV8/Luc is 1×1012/ml, it should be diluted with PBS to a working concentration of 1×1010/ml (dilution factor 100), then for 1 mL of working concentration of AAV 10 μL of stock AAV-Luc should be diluted with 990 μL PBS.

5. Mix 25 μL of each dilution with 25 μL AAV-Luc (ratio 1:1) in a new U or V-bottomed 96-well plate and incubate for one hour at 37° C.

For the positive control, mix 25 μL AAV-Luc with 25 μL diluent.

For the negative control (background), mix 25 μl diluent (HI-FBS) with 25 μL PBS.

6. Add 10 μl per well of AAV/sample mix to the plate with HEK293 cells (pre-treated with CC). Each dilution was analyzed at least in triplicate. Positive control: maximum (MAX) infection level (AAV mixed with diluent HI-FBS); background: HI-FBS mixed with PBS (MIN) and no AAV. An exemplary plate layout is shown in Table 2.

7. Protect plate from light (for example, wrap the plate in aluminum foil) and incubate in CO2 incubator at 37° C. for 24 hours.

**Day 2**

1. Thaw the Bright Glo Luciferase assay reagent at room temperature (18° C. to 25° C.) in the dark.

2. Remove media from the plate (for example, by quickly inverting the plate). Without washing the cells, add 50 μL of PBS per well.

3. Set up spectrophotometer to read chemiluminescence. If the spectrophotometer is BioTek the read conditions are: 500 ms, gain 125-135, height of plate 3.75 mm. Add 50 μL of Bright Glo substrate to each well, incubate plate 3 min in the dark and then read. For maximal light intensity, samples should be measured within 15 minutes of reagent addition.

**Calculation of Anti-AAV NAb Titer:**

**Method 1:**

NAb titer is defined as the neutralizing titer of the sample is the first dilution at which 50% or greater inhibition of the luciferase expression is measured.

NAb titer may be quantified manually by subtracting the average background value from all measurements and then by calculating percent of the total luciferase expression according to the following formula:

Percent luciferase expression=[(test sample luciferase reading−no virus luciferase signal)/(max luciferase signal−no virus luciferase signal)]*100

The neutralizing titer of the sample is determined as the first dilution at which 50% or greater inhibition of the luciferase expression is measured. For example, if 50% or greater inhibition is observed at a 1:10 dilution of the sample, the titer is reported as 1:10.

**Method 2:**

Alternatively, NAb titer may be quantified using GraphPad Prizm or any other suitable software.

Put data as XY file, where X is a testing sample dilutions and Y-is luminescence measurements in triplicates. Then go to results folder to analyze data: use XY analysis→Nonlinear regression (curve fit)→[Agonist] vs. response→Variable slope (four parameters).

The software will calculate EC50 which corresponds to NAb titer. Note, that the use of this analysis depends on the appropriate inhibition curve being attained. The curve should have well-defined plateaus at minimum and maximum dilutions. When the values at the highest dilution of the tested sample are much lower than the maximum value, the assay should be repeated with additional points of diluted samples.

**Results and Discussion**

Briefly, AAV vectors used in this study (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and recently identified Anc80L65) (Landegger et al., Nat Biotechnol 35:280-284 (2017)) were packaged in HEK293 cells by triple transfection with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and isolated by iodixanol gradient followed by ion-exchange column purification as described (Krotova et al., Mol Ther Oncolytics 15:166-177 (2019); Pandya et al., Immunol Cell Biol 92:116-123 (2014)). The vectors contain a single-strain expression cassette with chicken-b-actin promoter (CB)-driven fusion of firefly luciferase (Luc) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes (Pandya et al., J Immunother 38:292-298 (2015); Sayroo et al., Gene Ther 23:18-25 (2016)).

First, escalation doses of CC were used to identify the optimal drug concentration for AAV serotype 8 (FIG. 2A). Pretreatment of HEK293 with CC dose-dependently increased luciferase activity 24 hours after infection. The 10 μM CC dose was selected for further experimentation because it was determined to be the minimal concentration that induces high AAV transduction: luciferase activity was five times higher compared to non-treated cells and values were two orders higher than background.

In the next step of protocol optimization, 10 μM CC was added to cells at different time points before or after AAV 8 infection. The maximum increase in AAV8-mediated luciferase expression was observed when cells were pre-treated one hour prior to infection with AAV (FIG. 2B). Hence, in all subsequent experiments HEK293 were pre-treated with 10 μM CC one hour before infection.

Next, escalating doses of AAV8-Luc in the presence of CC were used to demonstrate the linear dose-dependency of luciferase expression in an MOI range of 100 to 5000 viral genomes (vg)/cell. In addition, pre-treatment of cells with CC together with pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (20 ng/ml) and TNFα (20 ng/ml) was found to further increased luciferase expression. It should be noted that without CC, treatment with IL-6 and TNFα only marginally increase luciferase expression.

The dramatic improvement of AAV8 transduction in vitro in the presence of CC prompted test to determine if similar effect could be achieved for other AAV serotypes. The transduction efficiency of ten common AAV serotypes at MOI 2000 vg/cell was analyzed. Without pre-treatment with CC, only cells infected with AAV1 and AAV2 had luciferase activity significantly higher than background levels at 24 hours and 48 hours after infection (see FIG. 3A). Pre-treatment with CC, however, resulted in significantly increased levels of luciferase for all tested serotypes (FIG. 3A). In addition, extending incubation time after infection from 24 hours to 48 hours significantly increased luciferase activity for all serotypes (FIG. 3B). Increasing incubation time to 48 hours may be particularly beneficial for measurement NAb for hard-to infect serotypes such as AAV3, AAV5, AAV10, or AAV8.

For example, in the absence of pre-treatment with CC, the luciferase activity for AAV10 was at background levels and for AAV3, 5, 8 and 9 slightly higher than background levels, making it impossible to measure NAb titers for these serotypes. After pretreatment with CC, the levels of luciferase expression for these serotypes were high enough to measure NAb titers.

The highest luciferase activity after pre-treatment with CC was observed for AAV2 (more than 1000 times higher background in the presence of CC at 48 hours) and the lowest luciferase activity after pre-treatment with CC was observed for AAV10 (8 times higher background).

Addition of IL-6 and TNFα at the time of CC pre-treatment improved infection efficiency for all serotypes except AAV3 (FIG. 3A). Thus, additional treatment IL-6 and TNFα may be used for some serotypes (for example, AAV10) if pre-treatment with CC and/or an increase of MOI is inadequate to provide reporter gene activity sufficient for an NAb assay.

To ensure that the addition of CC is not affecting measurements of NAb titer, AAV2 NAb titer was determined with non-treated HEK293 cells and CC pre-treated HEK293 cells. Because AAV2 exhibited the highest infection rates of any serotype for HEK293 cells with without any additional stimulation of cells, AAV2 was selected for this experiment. Mouse serum from animals injected intramuscularly (i.m) with 1010 AAV2-Luc was analyzed by the protocol described above.

Results are shown in FIG. 4 and indicate that CC does not affect NAb titer because inhibition appears at the same dilution of the serum. NAb titer was calculated using Method 1, above.

Finally, the successful measurements of NAb titers using the protocol described above for three different AAV serotypes (AAV8, AAV6, and AAV3) was demonstrated with mouse serum collected from animals injected intramuscularly with corresponding AAVs. Results are shown in FIG. 5. NAb titer was calculated using Method 1, above.

In summary, this Example describes the validation of a universal protocol for analysis of AAV-specific NAb for commonly used serotypes.
