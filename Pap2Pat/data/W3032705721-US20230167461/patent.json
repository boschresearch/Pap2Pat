The vectors contain a single-strain expression cassette with chicken-b-actin promoter (CB)-driven fusion of firefly luciferase (Luc) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) genes (Pandya et al., J Immunother 38:292-298 (2015); Sayroo et al., Gene Ther 23:18-25 (2016)).",
                                "First, escalation doses of CC were used to identify the optimal drug concentration for AAV serotype 8 (FIG. 2A). Pretreatment of HEK293 with CC dose-dependently increased luciferase activity 24 hours after infection. The 10 \u03bcM CC dose was selected for further experimentation because it was determined to be the minimal concentration that induces high AAV transduction: luciferase activity was five times higher compared to non-treated cells and values were two orders higher than background.",
                                "In the next step of protocol optimization, 10 \u03bcM CC was added to cells at different time points before or after AAV 8 infection. The maximum increase in AAV8-mediated luciferase expression was observed when cells were pre-treated one hour prior to infection with AAV (FIG. 2B). Hence, in all subsequent experiments HEK293 were pre-treated with 10 \u03bcM CC one hour before infection.",
                                "Next, escalating doses of AAV8-Luc in the presence of CC were used to demonstrate the linear dose-dependency of luciferase expression in an MOI range of 100 to 5000 viral genomes (vg)/cell. In addition, pre-treatment of cells with CC together with pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (20 ng/ml) and TNF\u03b1 (20 ng/ml) was found to further increased luciferase expression. It should be noted that without CC, treatment with IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 only marginally increase luciferase expression.",
                                "The dramatic improvement of AAV8 transduction in vitro in the presence of CC prompted test to determine if similar effect could be achieved for other AAV serotypes. The transduction efficiency of ten common AAV serotypes at MOI 2000 vg/cell was analyzed. Without pre-treatment with CC, only cells infected with AAV1 and AAV2 had luciferase activity significantly higher than background levels at 24 hours and 48 hours after infection (see FIG. 3A). Pre-treatment with CC, however, resulted in significantly increased levels of luciferase for all tested serotypes (FIG. 3A). In addition, extending incubation time after infection from 24 hours to 48 hours significantly increased luciferase activity for all serotypes (FIG. 3B). Increasing incubation time to 48 hours may be particularly beneficial for measurement NAb for hard-to infect serotypes such as AAV3, AAV5, AAV10, or AAV8.",

After pretreatment with CC, the levels of luciferase expression for these serotypes were high enough to measure NAb titers.",

Thus, additional treatment IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 may be used for some serotypes (for example, AAV10) if pre-treatment with CC and/or an increase of MOI is inadequate to provide reporter gene activity sufficient for an NAb assay.",

Because AAV2 exhibited the highest infection rates of any serotype for HEK293 cells with without any additional stimulation of cells, AAV2 was selected for this experiment. Mouse serum from animals injected intramuscularly (i.m) with 1010 AAV2-Luc was analyzed by the protocol described above.",
