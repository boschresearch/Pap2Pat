    "abstract": "Described is a system for predicting system trajectories toward critical transitions. The system transforms a set of multivariate time series of observables of a complex system into a set of symbolic multivariate time series. Then pair-wise time series of a transfer entropy (TE) measure are determined, wherein the TE measure quantifies the amount of information transfer from a source to a destination in the complex system. An associative transfer entropy (ATE) measure is determined which decomposes the pair-wise time series of TE to associative states of asymmetric, directional information flows, wherein the ATE measure is comprised of an ATE+ influence class and a ATE\u2212 influence class. The system estimates ATE+, TE, and ATE\u2212 trajectories over time, and at least one of the ATE+, TE, and ATE\u2212 trajectories is used to predict a critical transition in the complex system.",

                        "One central characteristic of complex social-technological systems is their self-organized emerging interactions which provide the benefits of exchanging information and resources effectively, yet at the same time increases the risk and pace of spreading attacks or failures. A small perturbation on a complex system operating in a high-risk unstable region can induce a critical transition that leads to unstoppable catastrophic failures.",
                        "There are a few recent works of early warning signals for heterogeneously networked dynamical systems. Kwon and Yang (see the List of Incorporated Cited Literature References, Literature Reference No. 1) use transfer entropy to analyze financial market data. They calculate pair-wise transfer entropy to form a transfer entropy matrix and demonstrate the asymmetrical influence from mature markets to emerging markets using transfer entropy. Their method estimates global transfer entropy, not local transfer entropy changing in time; therefore, their method cannot handle dynamics and structure changes in directional influence.",
                        "Staniek and Lehnertz (see Literature Reference No. 4) introduced a robust and computationally efficient method to estimate transfer entropy using a symbolization technique. Their demonstration of symbolic transfer entropy (STE) on brain electrical activity data shows STE is able to detect the asymmetric dependences and identify the hemisphere containing the epileptic focus without observing actual seizure activity. However, their emphasis is also not on identifying the dynamics of the complex system structure.",
                        "Scheffer et al. (see Literature Reference No. 5) surveys state-of-the-art methods that originated in the ecological domain. These methods focus only on homogeneous lattices with signals such as increased temporal correlation, skewness, and spatial correlations of the population dynamics, thus are not able to deal with heterogeneously networked dynamical systems.",
                        "Moon and Lu (see Literature References No. 2 and 3) developed a spectral early warning signals (EWS) theory that detects the approaching of critical transitions and can estimate the system structure and network connectivity near critical transitions using the covariance matrix. Although spectral EWS quantifies how much entities of a system are moving together, the symmetric nature of covariance spectrum does not permit the analysis of directional influences among entities.",

A small perturbation on a complex system operating in a high-risk unstable region can induce a critical transition that leads to unstoppable catastrophic failures. In the system according to the principles of the present invention, catastrophic failures can be avoided by detecting early warnings of critical transitions and predicting the likelihood of system trajectories and the lead time to the critical points.",

No. 13/904,945, entitled, \u201cDetection and Identification of Directional Influences Using Dynamic Spectrum\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the '945 application), which is an information dynamic spectrum framework that goes beyond unidirectional diffusion dynamics to investigate heterogeneously networked dynamical systems with transient directional influence. The '945 application is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.",

Multivariate time series of complex systems were transformed into the spectrum of Transfer Entropy Matrix (TEM) and Associative Transfer Entropy Matrix (ATEM) to capture information dynamics of the system. The novel spectral radius measures of TEM and ATEM were developed to detect early warning signals of source-driven instability, and induce directional influence structure to identify the source and reveal dynamics of directional influences. The framework described in the '945 application enables one not only to accurately detect, predict, and mitigate abrupt behavior changes in complex systems, but also to understand, design, and build more sustainable and resilient complex systems.",
                                "The idea of associative transfer entropy is to decompose transfer entropy (TE) by constraining associated states of two processes. The simplest case of ATE is two influence classes: one positive ATE+ and the other negative ATE\u2212. In this case, ATE is able to distinguish two situations where the amount of information transfer is the same but have opposite effects: the source drives the destination the same direction in ATE\u2212, and the source drives the destination the opposite direction in ATE\u2212. For dynamic data, meaning the amount of information flow is not constant, the TE/ATE of time series in a local time window is calculated, so that TE/ATE becomes a function of time. Such decomposition further enables one to investigate ATEM in the form of ATEM+ and ATEM\u2212.",
                                "Given ATE+/TE cross-over signature as the early warning signals of critical transition, the present invention predicts (1) the likelihood of system trajectories and (2) the lead time to critical points. It was first observed that ATE+ and TE are maximized, at the same time that ATE\u2212 flattened, prior to the system switching to alternative stable regimes. Therefore, model-based statistical forecasting was applied to estimate the likelihood of ATE+/TE/ATE\u2212 trajectories. The lead time is predicted by estimating the critical point based on the projected flattening of ATE\u2212 trajectories. The prediction method according to the principles of the present invention will continuously output the update of probabilistic cones as the system progresses. Determining the likelihood and lead time of critical points will enable further developments of a mitigation strategy to avoid critical transitions. Each of these aspects will be described in further detail below."

In the '945 application, the symbolization technique of Staniek and Lehnertz was adapted to calculate ATE. Specifically, the continuous-valued time sequence {x(t)}t=1N was symbolized by first ordering the values of {x(t), x(t+1), . . . x(t+m)} with {1, 2, . . . , m} and denoting {circumflex over (x)}(t)=associated permutation of order m the symbol of x(t) at t.

The plot in FIG. 3A is the circuit in voltage over time, where Ant1 represents Antenna 1, Ant2 represents Antenna 2, i1 represents port 1, and i2 represents port 2. The plot in FIG. 3B shows the TE/ATE+/ATE\u2212 curves over time. The curves are obtained from the absolute sum of spectrum of TEM/ATEM+/ATEM\u2212, respectively. It was found that the spectral radius of TEM/ATEM+/ATEM\u2212 also show similar outcomes, but since TEM is the sum of ATEM+ and ATEM\u2212, the ATE+ curve will never cross the TE curve. Thus, the absolute sum of the spectrum is more informative. As shown in FIG. 3B, the ATE+ curve crosses over the TE curve near time point 800, indicating the increasing in synchronization.
