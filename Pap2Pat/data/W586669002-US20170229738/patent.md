# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte, and a nonaqueous secondary battery using the same.

## BACKGROUND ART

Nonaqueous secondary batteries with a high energy density, such as lithium ion secondary batteries, are widely used for power sources of notebook computers, mobile phones, etc. Further, in addition to power sources of power tools and power sources of electric cars, the development of nonaqueous secondary batteries as, for example, power sources of portable electronic devices, such as mobile phones and notebook computers, has recently been progressing.

Thus, lithium ion secondary batteries are currently used for various power sources. One reason for this is that the use of lithium ions, which are elements with the highest ionization tendency, as a charge carrier allows a reduction in the potential of the negative electrode; consequently, the voltage as a battery increases. Nonaqueous secondary batteries using sodium ions, magnesium ions, or the like as a charge carrier are also known as post-lithium ion secondary batteries. In principle, however, the potential of the negative electrode is not less than the potential of metal lithium; after all, the performance of many post-lithium ion secondary batteries is much lower than that of lithium ion secondary batteries, which use lithium ions as a charge carrier.

Moreover, dendrite formation is one of the main drawbacks in nonaqueous secondary batteries using metal ions as a charge carrier, such as lithium ion secondary batteries. Various measures are taken to prevent dendrite formation; however, there is no sufficient solution.

On the other hand, an example using a salt containing a molecular ion is also known (e.g., PTL 1). In this case, however, lithium ions were used as a charge carrier bearing a negative electrode reaction.

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

### Technical Problem

In PTL 1, ions moving in and out of the positive electrode are different from ions moving in and out of the negative electrode (the charge carrier of the positive electrode reaction is different from the charge carrier of the negative electrode reaction), and the concentration of the electrolyte is reduced during charging. Thus, practical problems still remain. Moreover, the dendrite problem also still remains. On the other hand, it is expected that if rocking-chair nonaqueous secondary batteries, which use an ion other than monatomic ions as a charge carrier, and in which the same ion moves in and out of both the positive electrode and the negative electrode, can be configured, nonaqueous secondary batteries that exhibit performance superior to that of lithium ion secondary batteries can be produced.

Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a rocking-chair nonaqueous secondary battery, which uses an ion other than monatomic ions as a charge carrier, and in which the ion moves in and out of both the positive electrode and the negative electrode.

### Solution to Problem

The present inventors conducted extensive research to achieve the above object. As a result, the present inventors found that when a nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte contained a salt containing a charge carrier comprising a molecular ion, the molecular ion functioned as a charge carrier. In this case, the nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte may contain an alkali metal ion, but is preferably free from a charge carrier comprising an alkali metal ion. Moreover, it is preferable that substances that can deliver and receive the molecular ion are used as the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material. The present invention has been completed upon further research based on these findings. That is, the present invention includes the following structures.

Item 1. A nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte comprising a salt containing a charge carrier comprising a molecular ion.

Item 2. The nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte according to item 1, which is free from a charge carrier comprising an alkali metal ion.

Item 3. The nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte according to item 1 or 2, wherein the salt containing a charge carrier comprising a molecular ion is a salt consisting of molecular ions.

Item 4. The nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte according to any one of items 1 to 3, wherein the salt containing a molecular ion is a salt comprising:

a molecular cation represented by Formula (1):

wherein Y is an atom of Group 15 or 16 of the periodic table; R1 is the same or different, and is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, or a halogen atom; the two R1 may be bonded to form a ring together with adjacent Y; and m is 3 or 4; and

a molecular anion represented by Formula (2):

wherein Z is a boron atom or an atom of Group 15 of the periodic table; R2 is the same or different, and is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a halogen atom, or a group represented by —SO2Rf, wherein Rf is a fluorine atom or a fluoroalkyl group; and n is an integer of 2 to 6;

a triflate anion (CF3SO3−), or a perchlorate ion.

Item 5. A nonaqueous secondary battery comprising the nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte according to any one of items 1 to 4.

Item 6. The nonaqueous secondary battery according to item 5, further comprising a positive electrode containing a positive electrode active material, and a negative electrode containing a negative electrode active material;

wherein the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material are both materials that allow doping and dedoping of molecular anions, or the positive electrode active material and the negative electrode active material are both materials that allow doping and dedoping of molecular cations.

Item 7. The nonaqueous secondary battery according to item 6, wherein the materials that allow doping and dedoping of molecular anions are at least one member selected from the group consisting of conductive polymers, organic radical polymers, polymers having a ferrocene skeleton, conductive carbon materials, and organic sulfur compounds.

Item 8. The nonaqueous secondary battery according to item 6 or 7, wherein the materials that allow doping and dedoping of molecular cations are at least one member selected from the group consisting of inorganic active materials, redox active molecules having a carbonyl group, redox active molecules having an imine skeleton, and redox active molecules containing a sulfur atom.

Item 9. The nonaqueous secondary battery according to any one of items 5 to 8, which is a rocking-chair battery.

### Advantageous Effects of Invention

According to the present invention, the nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte comprises a salt containing a charge carrier comprising a molecular ion, and the molecular ion functions as a charge carrier in both the positive electrode reaction and the negative electrode reaction; therefore, a rocking-chair nonaqueous secondary battery, in which the ion moves in and out of both the positive electrode and the negative electrode, can be provided.

The ion conductivity of molecular ions is higher than the ion conductivity of lithium ions. For example, the limiting molar conductivity of molecular ions, such as tetramethyl ammonium cation, hexafluorophosphate anion, etc., is about twice the limiting molar conductivity of lithium ions. Accordingly, the nonaqueous secondary battery of the present invention, which uses a salt containing a charge carrier comprising a molecular ion, is expected to have higher input/output characteristics.

Further, according to the present invention, which uses a salt containing a charge carrier comprising a molecular ion (the molecular ion functions as a charge carrier), appropriate selection of the molecular ion allows the molecular ion to function at a potential lower than that of lithium ions, which are conventionally supposed to be able to function at the lowest potential. The voltage is further expected to increase, and the energy density is also further expected to increase.

Moreover, the present invention allows charging and discharging without using minor metals, such as cobalt; thus, lower cost can be realized.

Furthermore, the nonaqueous secondary battery comprising the nonaqueous secondary battery electrolyte of the present invention does not use alkali metal ions, such as lithium ions or alkaline earth metal ions, as the charge carrier (such ions do not contribute to the electrode reactions); therefore, the dendrite problem does not occur, and safety is high.

In addition, the present invention allows the use of any known separator. Thus, there are many material options, and lower cost can be realized.

From such a viewpoint, the separator is preferably a fine porous film, non-woven fabric, or the like that has a thickness of 10 to 50 μm and an aperture ratio of 30 to 70%, and contains one or more of polyethylene, polypropylene, an ethylene-propylene copolymer, etc. However, since dendrite formation cannot occur in principle in the present invention, separators that do not have sufficient strength (paper etc.) can also be used. Thus, there is a wide range of options for the separator.

Moreover, examples of the form of the nonaqueous secondary battery of the present invention include cylindrical shapes (a rectangular cylindrical shape, a circular cylindrical shape, etc.) that use a stainless steel can, an aluminium can, etc., as an outer can. Further, soft-package batteries using a laminate film integrated with a metal foil as their exterior bodies can also be used.

## EXAMPLES

The present invention is described in detail below based on Examples. However, the following Examples do not limit the present invention.

### Example 1

The electrolyte used was a 1 M solution containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (produced by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), which was a salt comprising the following cation:

and the following anion:

dissolved in propylene carbonate (produced by Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd.).

Next, poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK; produced by Sigma-Aldrich; molecular weight: 1.1×106 g/mol), which was used as a positive electrode active material, acetylene black and vapor-grown carbon fibers as a conductive material, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a binder were dispersed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) at a mass ratio of positive electrode active material, conductive material, and binder of 5:4:1 (the content ratio of acetylene black and vapor-grown carbon fibers in the conductive material was 1:1 (mass ratio)), thereby obtaining a positive electrode mixture. The positive electrode mixture was applied to an aluminum foil (thickness: 20 μm) and dried, followed by compression bonding, thereby producing a positive electrode.

Furthermore, as a negative electrode active material, poly(1,1′-pentyl-4,4′-bipyridinium ditetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate) (PBPy) (polymerization degree: 30 to 50) was synthesized by mixing 4,4′-bipyridine and 1,5-dibromopentane at a molar ratio of 1:1 in dimethylformamide, and condensing them by heating and stirring (150° C., 2 hours), followed by an ion exchange reaction using an excess amount of ammonium hexafluorophosphate.

1H-NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 9.4 (4H), 8.8 (4H), 4.7 (4H), 2.1 (4H) 1.5 (2H). 13C-NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 149, 146, 127, 61, 31, 23. Elemental analysis (C15H18F12N2P2)n: C, 34.90; H, 3.51; N, 5.43%. Found: C, 34.56; H, 3.69; N, 5.17%.

The negative electrode active material was mixed with acetylene black as a conductive material, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder at a ratio of active material, conductive material, and binder of 4:5:1 to form a sheet. The resulting sheet was compression-bonded to an aluminum mesh (thickness: 110 μm) to thereby produce a negative electrode.

The produced electrodes were independently charged and discharged in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using the above electrolyte. The electrodes were each taken out from the cell after a predetermined number of cycles (positive electrode: 10 cycles, negative electrode: 1 cycle), and arranged opposite to each other across a glass filter as a separator. Further using the above electrolyte, a coin-type battery was produced.

**Test Example 1: Charge-Discharge Test**

The coin-type battery obtained in Example 1 was subjected to a charge-discharge test in an atmosphere at 30° C. at a current density of 100 mA/g (PVK) within a voltage range of 0.0 to 3.2 V. FIGS. 1 and 2 show the results.

FIG. 1 shows charge-discharge curves. The intermediate voltage in the discharge curve is about 1.8 V. It is suggested that even when monatomic ions, such as lithium ions or sodium ions, are not contained as a charge carrier, molecular ions can function as the charge carrier, and that the resulting battery can function as a battery.

FIG. 2 shows the cycle change of discharge capacity. The reduction in the capacity when charge and discharge were repeated was small. The capacity after 20 cycles was about 80% of the initial discharge capacity (first cycle), and the cycle characteristics were excellent. Thus, a battery having excellent cycle characteristics was produced.

**Test Example 2: EDX Measurement**

The coin-type battery obtained in Example 1 was charged and discharged in the same manner as in Test Example 1. During charging and discharging of the battery, the change in the concentration of P (phosphorus atom) in the positive electrode and the negative electrode was measured by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). FIGS. 3 and 4 show the results.

The components containing P (phosphorus atom) in the coin-type battery obtained in Example 1 are only molecular anions PF6− contained in the electrolyte, and molecular anions PF6− present in the negative electrode active material. This means that when the P (phosphorus atom) concentration changes during charging and discharging, the PF6− concentration changes (PF6− is doped or dedoped).

FIG. 3 shows the change in the concentration of P (phosphorus atom) during charging and discharging of the positive electrode. It can be understood that in the positive electrode, the P (phosphorus atom) concentration increases during charging, and decreases during discharging. This suggests that the molecular anions PF6− are doped into the positive electrode (particularly the positive electrode active material) during charging, and that the molecular anions PF6− are dedoped from the positive electrode (particularly the positive electrode active material) during discharging.

FIG. 4 shows the change in the concentration of P (phosphorus atom) during charging and discharging of the negative electrode. It can be understood that in the negative electrode, contrary to the positive electrode, the P (phosphorus atom) concentration decreases during charging, and increases during discharging. This suggests that the molecular anions PF6− are dedoped from the negative electrode (particularly the negative electrode active material) during charging, and that the molecular anions PF6− are doped into the negative electrode (particularly the negative electrode active material) during discharging.

In light of the above, the molecular anions PF6− are dedoped from the negative electrode (particularly the negative electrode active material), and doped into the positive electrode (particularly the positive electrode active material) during charging. During discharging, the molecular anions PF6− are dedoped from the positive electrode (particularly the positive electrode active material), and doped into the negative electrode (particularly the negative electrode active material). This suggests that in the coin-type battery obtained in Example 1, only the molecular anions PF6− function as a rocking-chair charge carrier.

### Example 2

As an electrolyte, tetramethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonylimide, which was a salt comprising the following cation:

and the following anion:

CF3SO2—N⊖—SO2CF3

was synthesized in the following manner. 5 mmol of tetramethylammonium chloride (produced by Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) and 8 mmol of lithium trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (produced by Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) were each dissolved in methanol, and both mixtures were mixed and stirred. Distilled water was added to the resulting mixed solution, and concentrated by an evaporator. The deposit was filtered and dried to thereby obtain a desired product. The obtained salt was dissolved in triglyme (produced by Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd.), and the concentration was adjusted to 0.1 M. Thus, an electrolyte was prepared.

As the positive electrode active material, a 1,4,8,11-tetrahydroxydibenzo[b,i]thianthrene tetrakis(tetramethylammonium) salt, which was a positive electrode active material containing a tetramethyl ammonium cation, was synthesized by the following reaction pathway.

First, the hydroxy groups of 2,3-dichloro-5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (produced by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) were protected by acetyl using acetic anhydride (i). Then, the compound was induced into a molecule having a dibenzo[b,i]thianthrene skeleton by reaction with rubeanic acid (ii). Next, the acetyl groups were deprotected under base conditions (iii), and an ion exchange reaction using an excess amount of tetramethylammonium chloride was conducted (iv). Thus, the target compound was obtained.

M.p.>400° C., 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6): δ 6.5 (s, 4H), 3.1 (s, 48H).

The positive electrode active material (3 mg) was mixed with acetylene black as a conductive material, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder at a ratio of active material, conductive material, and binder of 4:5:1 to form a sheet. The resulting sheet was compression-bonded to an aluminum mesh (thickness: 110 μm), thereby producing a positive electrode.

As the negative electrode active material, 5,7,12,14-pentacenetetrone (produced by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) (1 mg) was used. The negative electrode active material was mixed with acetylene black and PTFE at the same ratio as in the positive electrode to form a sheet. The resulting sheet was compression-bonded to an aluminum mesh to thereby produce a negative electrode.

The produced electrodes were arranged opposite to each other across a glass filter as a separator. Further using the above electrolyte, an R2032-type coin battery was produced.

**Test Example 3: Charge-Discharge Test**

The coin-type battery obtained in Example 2 was subjected to a charge-discharge test in an atmosphere at 30° C. at a current density of 20 mA/g (positive electrode active material) within a voltage range of 0.5 to 2.5 V. FIG. 5 shows the results.

FIG. 5 shows charge-discharge curves. The average voltage of the discharge curves was about 1.0 V, and several numbers of charge and discharge cycles were possible. In the case of this battery system, the electrolyte contains only a molecular compound as an ionic species. Even in such a case, the resulting battery could function as a battery.
