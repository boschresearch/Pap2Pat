    "title": "Molecular ion battery: a rechargeable system without using any elemental ions as a charge carrier",
    "date": "2015-06-04",
    "abstract": "Is it possible to exceed the lithium redox potential in electrochemical systems? It seems impossible to exceed the lithium potential because the redox potential of the elemental lithium is the lowest among all the elements, which contributes to the high voltage characteristics of the widely used lithium ion battery. However, it should be possible when we use a molecule-based ion which is not reduced even at the lithium potential in principle. Here we propose a new model system using a molecular electrolyte salt with polymer-based active materials in order to verify whether a molecular ion species serves as a charge carrier. Although the potential of the negative-electrode is not yet lower than that of lithium at present, this study reveals that a molecular ion can work as a charge carrier in a battery and the system is certainly a molecular ion-based \u201crocking chair\u201d type battery.",

As the positive electrode material, a redox polymer having the carbazole skeleton, poly(N-vinylcarbazole): PVK (Fig. 1a)1920, which we previously reported as the positive electrode material in a lithium electrolyte system21 was used. As for the negative electrode active material, we focused on a 4,4\u2019-bipyridinium moiety, known as the viologen unit, and synthesized a polymer bearing the bipyridinium units by polymerization through the quaternization reaction2223 of the nitrogen atoms of 4,4\u2019-bipyridine with dibromopentane, followed by the ion exchange from Br\u2212 to PF6\u2212 to yield poly(1,1\u2019-pentyl-4,4\u2019-bipyridinium dihexafluorophosphate): PBPy (Fig. 1b). The 1H-NMR analysis indicated that the average degree of polymerization is 30 to 50."

                        "Figure 2a shows the first several charge/discharge, i.e., the PF6\u2212 insertion and deinsertion, respectively, curves of the prepared PVK electrode in the n-Bu4NPF6 electrolyte system in a three-electrode setup with the Ag+/Ag reference electrode. The electrode exhibits smooth discharge curves with an intermediate potential of 0.8\u2009V vs. Ag+/Ag with the discharge capacity of about 90\u2009mAh g(PVK)\u22121. The obtained capacity is 65% of the theoretical value of 139\u2009mAh g(PVK)\u22121 based on the assumption that a one-electron transfer redox reaction occurs between the neutral state and cation radical state of the carbazole moiety as shown in the reaction equation of Fig. 2c. The electrode using PVK shows no appreciable decay in the discharge capacity upon cycling (Fig. 2b) and maintains 84\u2009mAh g(PVK)\u22121 after 20 cycles. The coulomb efficiency (discharge capacity/charge capacity) during the early cycling is poor; however, it gradually becomes better upon cycling, reflecting the coupling reaction between the carbazole moieties during the charge process as explained in some previous reports192021. The cross-coupled PVK shown in Fig. 2d can also contribute to the charge/discharge process in the electrode. As reported by some groups, the 3- and 6-positions of the oxidized carbazole moiety have a relatively high spin density and these sites are reactive192021242526. Chemical modifications of such reactive positions by some protecting groups will stabilize the oxidized state, which may improve the coulomb efficiency during the charge/discharge process.",
                        "The charge/discharge, i.e., the PF6\u2212 deinsertion/insertion, curves of the negative electrode using the synthesized polymer, PBPy, are shown in Fig. 3a. These curves consist of two plateau potential regions at around \u22120.7 and \u22121.2\u2009V vs. Ag+/Ag, which are considered to reflect the stepwise two-electron transfer redox reaction of the bipyridinium moiety. The capacity of 79\u2009mAh g(PBPy)\u22121 observed in the first charge is 76% of the theoretical value of 104\u2009mAh g(PBPy)\u22121 based on the assumption of the two-electron redox reaction of the repeating unit (Fig. 3c). (In this paper, the charge and discharge of the negative electrode refer to the reduction and oxidation processes of the polymer, respectively). Although the capacities of the electrode for both the charge and discharge processes decrease upon cycling and the coulomb efficiency is even low as shown in Fig. 3b, the electrode maintains 36\u201338\u2009mAh g(PBPy)\u22121 after 20 cycles. The degree of polymerization for the PBPy polymer prepared in this study is not high as described above; therefore, the solubility of the PBPy polymer in the ordinary organic solvents is still relatively high. In fact, the electrolyte solution after cycling was colored and a migration of some organic compounds was also observed, indicating a dissolution of organic active materials occurs during cycling. Such a phenomenon can be a reason for the capacity decay of the electrode as reported for many low-molecular-weight organic active materials3101112. In addition to the chemical modifications of the bipyridinium moiety which can increase the chemical stability of the skeleton itself, controlling some polymeric structures such as branching and molecular-weight-increase may improve the cycle stability of the PBPy-electrode."

                        "In order to prove the concept of the molecular ion battery, it is important to show that the PF6\u2013 ion is indeed inserted in and extracted from these active materials during the charge/discharge process; therefore, we evaluated the change in stoichiometry of PF6\u2212 in the electrode ex situ by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Figure 4 plots the stoichiometric ratio of the phosphorus to nitrogen (P/N), i.e., the ratio of PF6\u2212 per carbazole unit in the positive electrode or that per pyridine unit in the negative electrode during the charge/discharge process. (The charge/discharge curves of the prepared cells and the EDX spectral changes are shown in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, respectively.) As for the positive electrode (Fig. 4a), the P/N ratio increases after the charge process, and the ratio decreases when the electrode is discharged. As for the negative electrode (Fig. 4b), the PF6\u2212 concentration decreases after the charge process, and returns to the initial level when the electrode is recharged, which is a complementary behavior to that of the positive electrode. The observed ratio changes in both electrodes are considered to reflect the charge/discharge mechanisms of these active materials suggested in Figs. 2c,d and 3c. The stoichiometric changes are slightly overestimated; however, they are in good agreement in the order of magnitude, providing evidence that the charge carrier in this system is PF6\u2212 and the prepared system becomes certainly a PF6\u2212-based \u201crocking chair type\u201d battery."

In assembling the cell, the capacity of the negative electrode was adjusted to be more than twice that of the positive electrode in order to utilize the lower potential region of the negative electrode. Figure 5a shows typical charge/discharge curves of the prepared sealed full cell. The cell exhibited about 100\u2009mAh g(PVK)\u22121 with the intermediate potential difference of 1.8\u2009V. The obtained discharge capacity is close to the value found in the three-electrode test of the PVK-electrode. The observed voltage well agrees with the difference between the potential of the discharge curve for the PVK-electrode (0.8\u2009V vs. Ag+/Ag) and the lower potential of the discharge curve for the PBPy electrode (\u22121.1\u2009V vs. Ag+/Ag). The observed potential difference is also in agreement with the theoretically estimated energy level difference (1.98\u2009eV) obtained from a quantum chemistry calculation based on the density functional theory (DFT), in which simplified model compounds were used (Supplementary Figure S3). This calculation also supports the fact that the reaction mechanism of this system is based on the redox of the present organic active materials. As for the prepared molecular ion battery system, the conceptual drawing of the mechanism and a demonstration to drive an LED lamp are shown in Fig. 5c,d. (The results of a high rate test of the cell are described in Supplementary Figure S4.) The prepared full cell exhibited a fairly good cycle stability; the cell maintained about 65% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles as shown in Fig. 5b."
