                        "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are heterogeneous molecules produced in mammalian cells with many product variants, including variants resulting from post-translational modifications (PTMs). Variants produced via PTMs can occur throughout the lifespan of a mAb during production, purification, storage, and post-administration. These variants or product-related modifications are also referred to as product quality attributes (PQAs). Controlling PQAs within predefined acceptance criteria is vital to the biopharmaceutical industry because it ensures consistent product quality and reduces potential impacts on drug safety and efficacy. The modifications that occur during drug production and storage can often be reliably monitored and controlled. However, additional modifications can occur after drug administration due to the remarkably different environments of the blood stream versus formulation buffers. In vivo modifications of mAbs are usually difficult to monitor and less often studied. Assessment and prediction of PTM changes in vivo would not only facilitate the understanding of quality attribute criticality for product risk assessment, but would also help product design and development teams engineer mAb drug candidates with enhanced in vivo stability.",
                        "A Food and Drug Administration guidance for industry recommends that sponsors should evaluate susceptibilities of therapeutic proteins to modifications within the in vivo milieu (see, Guidance for Industry, Immunogenicity Assessment for Therapeutic Protein Products. 2014). As a result, in vivo behavior of many PQAs, including deamidation (see, for example, Huang et al., Analytical chemistry 2005; 77:1432-9; Ouellette et al., mAbs 2013; 5:432-44; Yin et al., Pharmaceutical research 2013; 30:167-78; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0), oxidation (see, for example, Yin et al., Pharmaceutical research 2013; 30:167-78; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0), glycation (see, for example, Goetze et al., Glycobiology 2012; 22:221-34), glycosylation (see, for example, Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Goetze et al., Glycobiology 2011; 21:949-59; Alessandri et al., mAbs 2012; 4:509-20.), disulfides (see, for example, Li Y et al., mAbs 2016:0; Liu et al., The Journal of biological chemistry 2008; 283:29266-72), N-terminal pyroglutamate (see, for example, Yin et al., Pharmaceutical research 2013; 30:167-78; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Liu et al., The Journal of biological chemistry 2011; 286:11211-7), and C-terminal lysine removal (see, for example, Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Cai et al., Biotechnology and bioengineering 2011; 108:404-12) have been investigated in animal or human samples. Affinity purification is often used to extract the therapeutic mAb from serum samples to reduce the interference of endogenous protein background in analysis (see, for example, Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0). For studies in animals, an anti-human Fc antibody or an antigen can be readily used as a capture reagent; for human studies, an antigen or an antibody that specifically recognizes the unique complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the therapeutic mAb can be used as a capture reagent. After affinity purification, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) peptide mapping is often used to quantitate the relative abundance of PTM product variants. Recently, in vivo PTM quantitation has been combined with pharmacokinetic (PK) models to evaluate the formation and elimination of PTM product variants and quantitatively assess the subject's exposure to PQAs in single-dose regimens (see, for example, Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Goetze et al., mAbs 2010; 2:500-7) to help establish the criticality of PQAs for product risk assessment. However, modeling that simulates the in vivo progression of PTMs and subject's exposure to PQAs to quantitatively assess criticality of the PQAs in multiple-dose regimens has not been attempted."

Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (\u201cLCVR or \u201cVL\u201d) and a light chain constant region (CL). The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.

                                "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced in mammalian cells are heterogeneous as a result of post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are important product quality attributes (PQAs) that can potentially impact drug stability, safety, and efficacy (Xu et al., Journal of Applied Bioanalysis 2017; 3:21-5). PTMs can occur during mAb production, purification, storage, and post-administration (Kozlowski et al., Advanced drug delivery reviews 2006; 58:707-22; Liu et al., Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 2008; 97:2426-47; Goetze et al., mAbs 2010; 2:500-7; Wang et al., Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 2007; 96:1-26). The modifications that occur during drug production and storage can be reliably monitored and controlled. However, additional modifications may occur after drug administration as a result of the different environments encountered by mAbs in vivo versus in vitro. The PTMs of a mAb changes remarkably after administration into the bloodstream compared to in vitro conditions. Thus, monitoring in vivo PTM changes of mAbs helps evaluate the criticality of PQAs during product risk assessment. In addition, quantitative assessment of a subject's exposure to PTM variants helps assess the impact of PTMs on the safety and efficacy of therapeutic mAbs. Assessment and prediction of PTMs that can occur in vivo not only facilitate the understanding of quality attribute criticality for product risk assessment, but also help product development teams to engineer mAb drug candidates with enhanced in vivo stability.",
                                "As disclosed herein, the inventors have undertaken a detailed analysis and determination of product quality attributes (PQAs) that are present in therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Using the therapeutic monoclonal antibody MAB1 as a model, the inventors have assessed a number of post-translation modifications, including, for example, deamidation, oxidation, N-terminal pyroglutamate formation, and C-terminal lysine removal. As disclosed herein the inventors determined PTMs (e.g., deamidation, oxidation, N-terminal pyroglutamate formation, C-terminal lysine removal, and high mannose glycosylation) of a therapeutic mAb, MAB1, in single- and multiple-dose monkey pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Using the data obtained, the inventors built modeling equations to calculate the in vivo serum concentrations of PQAs, the subject's exposure to PQAs, and the relative abundance of PQAs in single- and multiple-dose regimens using three common PTMs as examples. The model predictions demonstrated agreement with the experimental results. An example application of the models was elucidated using a hypothetical PTM. The models provide bioanalytical chemists with a simplified modeling tool to quantitatively assess the criticality of PQAs when advanced PK models are not available. As detailed in the Example below, monkey serum samples from single- and multiple-dose PK studies were analyzed with affinity purification followed by LC-MS/MS, to determine a number of post-translational attributes of MAB1. Using the data obtained from this analysis, the inventors were able to construct a mathematical model and/or simulation of the in vivo progression of antibody post-translational modifications to predict a subject's exposure to product quality attributes of a therapeutic antibody. The simulation provides a quantitative approach to assess the criticality of the PQAs.",
                                "Based on a single-dose PK study of the PQAs of MAB1, the inventors were able to model PK concentration and proportion of PTM variants, and to quantitatively assess and predict the subject's exposure to a representative PTM attribute (for example, asparagine deamidation) in both single- and multiple-dose regimens. The model also predicted the maximum and minimum PTM levels observed in the multiple-dose regimens. This modeling approach provides a new tool for bioanalytical chemists to quantitatively assess the criticality of PQAs in therapeutic mAbs. The models could be used to evaluate the impact of the PQAs caused by process changes or lot-to-lot variability by adjusting the initial PQA levels (P0). If the modeling demonstrated that the progression of a PQA or the subject's exposure to the PQA is insensitive to the initial levels of PQAs, the acceptable ranges of the PQA could be widened to adopt the process changes.",
                                "The models could also be used to simulate the subject's exposure by extending the dosing period (t) or changing the dosing interval (\u03c4), providing a quantitative assessment of the subject's exposure to PQAs in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Quantitative assessment of the subject's exposure to a PQA could help evaluate the risks associated with the PQA. A PQA with known adverse immunological reactions that has been determined to have a high exposure level during PK studies would have high potential risk. In such cases, certain strategies (e.g. protein re-engineering to enhance the in vivo stability) could be implemented to eliminate or reduce the level of the PQA.",

                                "Disclosed herein is a method of predicting an in vivo serum concentration of an antibody with a post-translational modification of interest after administration of the antibody (such as a therapeutic monoclonal antibody) to a subject. The disclosed method includes predicting a percentage of the antibody with the post-translational modification of interest using an in vivo rate constant determined for the post-translational modification of interest. The percentage of the antibody with the post-translational modification can be multiplied by the total in vivo concentration of the antibody at any time point to determine the concentration of the antibody with the post-translational modification of interest at that time point. For example, using the equation CPTM(t)=C(t)\u00b7P(t), where C(t) is the serum concentration of the antibody; and P(t) is the percentage of the post-translational modification of interest. The serum concentration (CPTM(t)) of the antibody with the post-translational modification of interest can be determined. In other words, the serum concentration of the antibody with the post-translational modification of interest is the percentage of total antibody having that post-translational modification. As disclosed herein, the serum concentration of the antibody may be described by the two-compartment pharmacokinetic model equation as C(t)=Ae\u2212\u03b1t+Be\u2212\u03b2t, where A and B are hybrid coefficients when \u03b1 and \u03b2 are hybrid first order constants, respectively.",
                                "In embodiments, the in vivo rate constant for the post-translational modification of interest is determined by quantitating a percentage of the post-translational modification of interest as a function of time after a single dose and fitting the quantitated percentage of the post-translational modification of interest to the equation PPTM(t)=1\u2212(1\u2212P0)\u00b7e\u2212kt, where PPTM(t) is the proportion of the post-translational modification of interest as a function of time; P0 is an initial percentage post-translational modification of interest; and kPTM is the post-translational modification rate constant for the post-translational modification of interest. By fitting the curve to the measured percentage of the post-translational modification of interest the rate constant kPTM can be determined, for example using non-linear regression or other mathematical fitting algorithms.",
                                "In embodiments, the method can also include determining the exposure of the subject to the amount of antibody with the post-translational modification of interest. For example, using area under the curve (AUC) analyses of the concentration (CPTM(t)) of the antibody with the post-translational modification of interest over a time period of interest, for example days, weeks or even months, yields a value for the total exposure of the subject to the amount of antibody having the post-translational modification of interest.",
                                "Looking at multiple sites simultaneously is also possible. For example the proportion of an antibody with a post-translational modification at a certain site can be described by first order kinetics, as PPTM_site_i(t)=1\u2212(1\u2212PPTM_site_i)\u00b7e\u2212kt, where PPTM_site_i(t) is the proportion of the post-translational modification at a site i as a function of time; P0 is the initial post-translational modification level that site i; kPTM_site_i is the post-translational modification rate constant at site i. Therefore, the PK concentration of antibody with a certain site i within the antibody post translationally modified can be described as CPTM_site_i(t)=C(t)\u00b7PPTM_site_i(t). The area under the curve (AUC) of CPTM_site_i(t) plot presents the subject's exposure to a quality attribute. One can further calculate the approximate concentration of each species of antibody variant, for example having 1, 2, 3, or even more distinct post-translational modifications.",
                                "As discussed in the Example below with respect to deamidation, by extending the model to multiple administrations, the method disclosed herein may be used to predict the in vivo serum concentration of an antibody with the post-translational modification of interest after multiple administrations of the antibody. For example, predicting the in vivo serum concentration of an antibody with the post-translational modification of interest after multiple administrations of the antibody can include superimposing multiple single administration models, wherein the serum concentration of the antibody at each administration is described individually by a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model equation as C(t)=Ae\u2212\u03b1t+Be\u2212\u03b2t, where A and B are hybrid coefficients when \u03b1 and \u03b2 are hybrid first order constants, respectively.",

Three common deamidation sites, \u201cNG\u201d (Asn Site 1) in CH2 domain, \u201cNG\u201d (Asn Site 2) and \u201cNN\u201d (Asn Site 3) in the PENNY peptide of the CH3 domain were monitored in this study. In this work, three deamidation sites of Asn, \u201cNG\u201d (Asn site 1) in the CH2 domain, \u201cNG\u201d (Asn site 2) and \u201cNN\u201d (Asn site 3) in the CH3 domain were monitored. In the single-dose PK study, the relative abundance of deamidation at Asn site 1 remained nearly unchanged at a low level of \u02dc0.2% over 56 days (FIG. 3A). The relative abundance of deamidation of Asn Site 2 and Asn Site 3 increased from \u02dc1% to 25.5% and 9.1% over 56 days, respectively (FIG. 3A). The deamidation rate depends on the primary amino acid sequence, protein structure, pH, temperature, and buffer composition (Chelius et al., Analytical Chemistry 2005; 77:6004-11; Sinha et al., Protein Science: a publication of the Protein Society 2009; 18:1573-84; Kossiakoff, Science 1988; 240:191-4; Athmer et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 2002; 277:30502-7; Xie et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 1999; 88:8-13; Wearne et al., Proteins 1989; 5:8-12; Capasso et al., The Journal of Peptide Research: official journal of the American Peptide Society 1999; 54:377-82; Song Y et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 2001; 90:141-56; Wakankar et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 2006; 95:2321-36; Zheng et al., International Journal of Pharmaceutics 2006; 308:46-51; Pace et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 2013; 102:1712-23). An Asn residue followed by glycine (Gly) or Serine (Ser) within the primary amino acid sequence is particularly susceptible to deamidation (Patel et al., Pharmaceutical Research 1990; 7:787-93; Stephenson et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 1989; 264:6164-70; et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2001; 98:944-9; Robinson et al., The Journal of Peptide Research: official journal of the American Peptide Society 2004; 63:426-36). The \u201cNG\u201d and \u201cNN\u201d sites are fully exposed to solvent, and therefore more susceptible to deamidation (DeLano et al., Science 2000; 287:1279-83) than the \u201cNG\u201d site in the CH2 domain (DeLano et al., Science 2000; 287:1279-83).",
                                "The deamidation rate can be described using the first-order rate equation as previously established (Geiger et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 1987; 262:785-94). The rate equation can be expressed as Pdeam(t)=1\u2212(1\u2212P0)\u00b7ekt where Pdeam(t), as described in the Materials and Methods. is the proportion of the deamidation as a function of time; P0 is the initial deamidation level; kdeam is the deamidation rate constant. The equation was non-linearly fitted to the LC-MS measured deamidation levels in the single dose study to determine the best-fit parameters (FIG. 3A and Table 1). The in vivo deamidation rate constants of Asn Site 1, 2, and 3 were non-linearly fitted to be 0.003278% day\u22121, 0.5384% day\u22121, and 0.1566% day\u22121, respectively with a R2 of 0.9946, 0.9866, and 0.8941, respectively (Table 1).",

                                "In the multiple-dose study, deamidation of Asn Site 1 remained nearly unchanged at a low level of \u02dc0.5% following 5 biweekly doses over 56 days (FIG. 3B). The relative abundance of deamidation on Asn Sites 2 and 3 accumulated within each dosing interval but dropped sharply after each new dose because of dilution with newly administrated non-deamidated MAB1 (FIG. 3B). The pre-dose and post-dose levels of deamidation gradually increased following each dose due to the accumulation of deamidated MAB1. The pre-dose level of deamidation at Asn site 2 prior to the 5th dose on Day 56 increased to 14.2% while the post-dose level reached 7.9% (FIG. 3B). The pre-dose level of deamidation at Asn site 3 prior to the 5th dose on Day 56 increased to 6.2% while the post-dose level reached 3.6% (FIG. 3B). As a result, the relative abundance of deamidation at Asn site 2 and 3 exhibited a saw-tooth pattern with an increasing trend over time (FIG. 3B). FIG. 3B also suggests that both pre-dose and post-dose levels of deamidation will approach to a steady-state after a finite number of doses. To predict the steady-state levels of deamination, a 2-compartment model for MAB1 concentrations was built that will be discussed in the modeling sections below. Met oxidation is another common PTM in mAbs (Yin et al., Pharmaceutical research 2013; 30:167-78; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Liu et al., The Journal of biological chemistry 2011; 286:11211-718). Met oxidation in the Fc region has been shown to impact the Fc receptor binding (Pan et al., Protein Science: a publication of the Protein Society 2009; 18:424-33). In this work, three common Met oxidation sites in the Fc region were evaluated, Met Site 1 in CH2 domain as well as Met Site 2 and 3 in the CH3 domain. In the single-dose study, relative abundance of oxidation at Met Site 1, 2, and 3 were relatively unchanged over 56 days at a level of \u02dc8.0%, \u02dc2.0%, and \u02dc5.0%, respectively (FIG. 4A). In the multiple-dose study, the level of oxidation at Met Site 1 decreased slightly during each dosing interval and increased slightly after each dose, exhibiting a saw-tooth pattern that fluctuates between \u02dc7.0% and \u02dc9.0%. The levels of oxidation at Met site 2 and 3 remained stable at a level of \u02dc1.0% and 4.0%, respectively, in the multiple-dose study (FIG. 4B).",
                                "The N-terminal glutamine and glutamate at the N-termini of mAbs are prone to form pyroglutamate through chemical or enzymatic cyclization. The conversion of glutamine occurs much faster than that of glutamate (Yin et al., Pharmaceutical research 2013; 30:167-78; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Liu et al., The Journal of biological chemistry 2011; 286:11211-718). The N-terminal cyclized protein is resistant to digestion by amino peptidases, preventing degradation. Although glutaminyl cyclase, an enzyme that catalyzes this conversion, is found in human blood (Schilling et al., Biological Chemistry 2008; 389:983-91), the formation of pyroglutamate from glutamate of mAbs in vivo is predominantly a pH-dependent non-enzymatic reaction, as it bears the same rate constant in PBS in vitro (Yin et al., Pharmaceutical Research 2013; 30:167-78; Liu et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 2011; 286:11211-7). In the single-dose study, N-terminal pyroglutamate increased from 0.7% to 11.7% over 56 days (FIG. 5A). The in vivo N-terminal pyroglutamate formation rate was determined to be 0.2201% day\u22121 with a R2 of 0.9970 using non-linear fitting to the LC-MS measured N-terminal pyroglutamate levels. In the multiple-dose study, N-terminal pyroglutamate formation resembled a saw-tooth pattern similar to Asn deamidation (FIG. 5B). The level of pyroglutamate increased during each dosing interval but reduced sharply after each new dose as a result of dilution with newly administrated unmodified MAB1. Prior to the 5th dose on Day 56, the level of pyroglutamate raised to 7.6% and then dipped to 4.2% following the 5th dose (FIG. 5B).",
                                "The C-terminal lysine residue of a mAb heavy chain is susceptible to removal by basic carboxypeptidase during protein expression (Dick et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering 2008; 100:1132-43). Partial removal of the C-terminal lysine leads to charge heterogeneity. The percent of MAB1 drug product containing C-terminal lysine before administration was \u02dc2.0%. In both single and multiple-dose studies, the C-terminal lysine was rapidly removed within one day following each dose (FIG. 6). These observations are consistent with a previously reported study.",
                                "N-linked glycosylation at the Fc region is a commonly monitored PQA of a mAb. The predominant structures of N-linked glycoforms on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) expressed mAbs are typically composed of a core bi-antennary pentasaccharide structure with one or more additional monosaccharides attached. In addition to the complex bi-antennary oligosaccharide structures, high-mannose glycoforms (e.g., Mannose 5) can also be observed on CHO-expressed antibodies. In the single-dose study, the relative abundances of the major glycoforms (fucosylated complex bi-antennary) remained unchanged over 56 days. However, relative abundance of Mannose 5 glycoform decreased from 0.5% to undetectable within 6 weeks (FIG. 6A). This finding is in agreement with faster serum clearance of high-mannose glycoforms due to a high-mannose receptor-mediated clearance pathway (Goetze et al., Glycobiology 2011; 21:949-59; Alessandri et al., mAbs 2012; 4:509-20). In the multiple-dose study, the level of Mannose 5 decreased between during each dosing intervals and evaluated immediately following each new dose because of blending with newly administrated MAB1 with a higher level of Mannose 5, exhibiting a saw-tooth pattern (FIG. 6B). Prior to administration of the 5th dose, the level of Mannose 5 decreased to 0.1%. After administration of the 5th dose, the level of Mannose 5 increased to 0.4%.",

The in vivo serum concentration of a mAb with a certain PTM can be described as CPTM(t)=C(t)\u00b7P(t), as described in the Materials and Method section. The area under the curve (AUC) of CPTM(t) corresponds to the subject's exposure to the mAb with the PTM (Goetze et al., mAbs 2010; 2:500-7). In this work, deamidation at Asn site 2 and 3 as well as the N-terminal pyroglutamate formation were used as examples to demonstrate the modeling of the subject's exposure to PQAs in the single-dose study. The modeling was not performed on other PTMs discussed in this paper because Met oxidation was not changed in vivo (FIG. 4); the C-terminal lysine was rapidly removed within hours after administration (FIG. 6); the levels of Mannose 5 and deamidation at Asn site 1 were extremely low (less than 0.5%, FIG. 3 and FIG. 7), making the modeling of these PTMs may not be practically meaningful.",

                                "Quantitative assessment of PQAs of a therapeutic protein in vivo is important because it helps to identify potential critical quality attributes (CQAs) that would not otherwise be identified in vitro, thereby influencing product risk assessment and control strategy. The models described in this paper can be used to quantitatively assess of PQAs in many applications. First, the in vivo progression of PQAs and the subject's exposure to the PQAs in single and multiple-dose regimens can be calculated using these models. The good agreements between model predictions and experimental measurements have been demonstrated in the sections above (FIGS. 8, 9, and 10). Second, the models can be used to predict the subject's exposure by extending the dosing period (t) and determine the pre-dose and post-dose steady-state concentrations/levels of PQAs (FIGS. 9 and 10), providing insights to pre-clinical and clinical studies. Third, the models can be used to evaluate the impact of changes in the initial levels of PQAs resulting from process changes or lot-to-lot variability by adjusting the initial levels of PQAs (P0) in the modeling equations. This is particularly meaningful if the PQA is a CDR modification. Since the MAB1 used in this work does not have a CDR modification suitable for this modeling application, a hypothetical CDR deamidation with an in vivo deamidation rate of 2.5% per day\u22121 was used as an example of using the models to assess the impact of the initial levels of CDR deamidation on the subject's exposure to PQAs. If there were three batches of drug products with the initial levels of the hypothetical CDR deamidation of 0%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. The hypothetical CDR deamidation in vivo overtime of these batches can be described as Pdeam(t)=1\u2212(1\u22120)\u00b7e\u22120.025t, Pdeam(t)=1\u2212(1\u22120.1)\u00b7e\u22120.025t, and Pdeam(t)=1\u2212(1\u22120.2)\u00b7e\u22120.025t, respectively. Using the models described above, the subject's exposure to the hypothetical CDR deamidated variants with 0%, 10%, and 20% initial deamidation over 56 days in the single-dose study are 1385 \u03bcg/mL\u00b7day, 1653 \u03bcg/mL\u00b7day, and 1921 \u03bcg/mL\u00b7day, respectively, consisting of 32.5%, 38.8%, and 45.1% subject's exposure to the total mAb, respectively (FIG. 11A). For multiple-dose study, the subject's exposure to the hypothetical CDR deamidated variants with 0%, 10%, and 20% initial deamidation over 5 doses (56 days) are 1086 \u03bcg/mL\u00b7day, 1478 \u03bcg/mL\u00b7day, and 1871 \u03bcg/mL\u00b7day, respectively, consisting of 21.7%, 29.5%, and 37.3% subject's exposure to the total mAb, respectively (FIG. 11B). Thus, if the process control resulted in \u00b110% of initial levels of this hypothetical CDR deamidation, the subject's exposure to this CDR deamidated mAb varies about 6-8% in the single- or multiple-dose studies over 56 days. Since the modeling demonstrates that the subject's exposure to this hypothetical CDR deamidation is insensitive to the initial level of the PQA, the acceptable ranges of the PQA could be widened to allow justification of process risk assessment. Combining with the effect of a CDR modification on the potency measured by a potency assay, the modeling results can be used to estimate the subject's exposure to effective drug when the initial CDR modification changes resulted from process controls or lot-to-lot variation, providing critical information for product risk assessment."

                        "The dynamic in vivo environment of the circulating bloodstream, resulting in mAb clearance, elimination, and degradation, is much more relevant for assessing changes of PQAs in patients compared to the static incubation of mAbs in PBS or serum in vitro (Yin et al., Pharmaceutical research 2013; 30:167-78). Thus, in vivo PQA quantitation and modeling provide critical information, which would not obtain from the in vitro studies, to assess the criticality of the PQAs. For example, For example, these results presented herein (FIG. 6) and previous studies (Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Cai et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering 2011; 108:404-12) have shown that in vivo C-terminal lysine is rapidly removed within one day. Similarly, trisulfide bonds have been shown to be rapidly converted to disulfide bonds in vivo (Li et al., mAbs 2016:0). The results presented herein (FIG. 4) and previous studies (Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0) demonstrated that the levels of methionine oxidation are often unaffected following in vivo administration. Therefore, C-terminal lysine removal, trisulfide bond, and methionine oxidation are less likely to be considered CQAs. In contrast, deamidation were shown to accumulate in vivo in single- and multiple-dosing regimens (FIG. 3) and previous studies (Li et al., mAbs 2016:0; Li et al., mAbs 2016:0). Deamidation that occurs and accumulates at the CDR region could potentially impact on drug efficacy (Yan et al., Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 2009; 98:3509-21; Haberger et al., mAbs 2014; 6:327-39) or cause off-target binding. Thus, modeling CDR deamidation in vivo using the equations described in this paper can quantitatively assess the impact of the CDR deamidation on the subject's exposure, as demonstrated above (FIG. 11).",
                        "In this work, asparagine deamidation and N-terminal pyroglutamate formation were used as representative PTMs to demonstrate the validity of our models. Our models can also be applied to other PTMs that exhibit either increasing or decreasing trends. For example, models were applied to assess Mannose 5 clearance by adopting the third-order kinetic because of the enzymatic based clearance of Mannose 5. The predicted values matched well with the experimental data even though the relative abundance of Mannose 5 decreased to below 1.0% over time (data not shown). Our models can be used to calculate other parameters to evaluate a given attribute or PTM in a multiple-dose study. These parameters include the accumulation rate to the steady state, the average level at the steady state, and the degree of variability of a PTM at the steady state.",
                        "In summary, the inventors characterized the common in vivo PTM changes of a therapeutic mAb (MAB1), and modeled the in vivo behaviors of PTMs for both single- and multiple-dose studies regimens to evaluate the impact of in vivo PTMs. Three asparagine residues located in the Fc region of MAB1 exhibited different deamidation rates. The levels of oxidation at three methionine residues in the Fc region of MAB1 showed no change over time in vivo. N-terminal pyroglutamate formed rapidly in vivo. C-terminal lysine was completely removed within one day. MAB1 possessing high mannose glycosylation revealed the accelerated clearance. We used two Asn deamidation and the N-terminal pyroglutamate formation as representative PQAs and built modeling equations to calculate the serum concentrations of PQAs, the subject's exposure to PQAs, and the in vivo relative abundances of PQAs both single- and multiple-dose regimens. The model predictions were validated by the experimental measurements. Thus, the models can be used to simulate the in vivo PQA progression subject's exposure to PQAs in both single- and multiple-dose regimens providing quantitative approaches for the criticality assessment PQAs in therapeutic mAbs.",
