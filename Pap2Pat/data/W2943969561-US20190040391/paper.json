    "title": "Discovery of tumoricidal DNA oligonucleotides by effect-directedin-vitroevolution",
    "date": "2019-05-07",
    "abstract": "Our current model of drug discovery is challenged by the relative ineffectiveness of drugs against highly variable and rapidly evolving diseases and their relatively high incidence of adverse effects due to poor selectivity. Here we describe a robust and reproducible platform which could potentially address these limitations. The platform enables rapid, de-novo discovery of DNA oligonucleotides evolved in-vitro to exert specific biological effects on target cells. Unlike aptamers, which are selected by their ligand binding capacity, this platform is driven directly by therapeutic effect and selectivity towards target vs negative target cells. The process could, therefore, operate without any a-priori knowledge (e.g. mutations, biomarker expression, or known drug resistance) of the target. We report the discovery of DNA oligonucleotides with direct and selective cytotoxicity towards several tumor cell lines as well as primary, patient-derived solid and hematological tumors, some with chemotherapy resistance. Oligonucleotides discovered by this platform exhibited favorable biodistribution in animals, persistence in target tumors up to 48 hours after injection, and safety in human blood. These oligonucleotides showed remarkable efficacy in-vivo as well as ex-vivo in freshly obtained, 3D cultured human tumors resistant to multiple chemotherapies. With further improvement, these findings could lead to a drug discovery model which is target-tailored, mechanism-flexible, and nearly on-demand.",

                "Effect and selectivity are essential requirements for therapeutic molecules. However, it has become increasingly clear that for many severe diseases, achieving these requirements could be challenging. The continual emergence of drug resistance in cancer, for example, makes therapeutic targeting extremely difficult1\u20133. The problem is compounded by the high variability and patient heterogeneity of the disease4, making it challenging for a single drug or protocol to be both effective and safe across many patients5. New drugs continue to be developed despite known resistance to them and the prediction that they will be effective only for a small fraction of patients5,6. The current premise of personalized medicine typically refers to predicting or validating responses to drugs from the set of currently available ones7, leaving the problems of emergent resistance and off-target toxicity of these drugs unaddressed. Although superior to older generation chemotherapy in many ways, antibodies are specific to their antigens and would show selectivity only when antigen expression is limited to a specific target cell. Recently approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies, while new and promising, have often shown adverse effects due to this fact8.",
                "For the purposes of this study we use cancer as a case study, and argue that an effective and viable therapeutic strategy for this disease would have to satisfy three requirements: (1) It needs to be tailored to a specific tumor/patient, due to the observed variability between individual cases; (2) It needs to be selective, to minimize adverse effects or eliminate them completely; and (3) Its discovery needs to be rapid and economically repeatable, to counter the emergence of resistance.",
                "In this article, we describe a platform that essentially fulfills these requirements. While further development and improvement are necessary to expand it and establish its clinical potential in cancer and other conditions, we report extremely promising results that should motivate this effort. This platform is based on the in vitro evolution of oligonucleotides driven directly by a therapeutic response.",
                "The ability to artificially evolve and select nucleic acid molecules with specific properties has been known for nearly three decades9,10 and has produced diverse functions11\u201315, molecular and cellular specificities16\u201318, and therapeutic effects19\u201321. The SELEX15,16 (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) method is routinely used to find aptamers - RNA or DNA oligonucleotides with the ability to bind a specific molecular or cellular target. In SELEX, iterating rounds of selection are applied to an initial population of 109\u20131015 oligonucleotides. Selection pressure drives this population towards a subpopulation enriched with oligonucleotides capable of binding the target presented to them. The process is designed such that the oligonucleotides that are best binders survive each round and are passed on to the next one. Stringent washing steps are applied as a selective force for the removal of oligos that do not bind the target. At the end of the process, binding candidates are selected and tested separately. Importantly, previously described cell-specific aptamers have been reported to also have a secondary function subsequent to the binding. This has been usually achieved by an additional step in which the positive binders are tested again, this time at the cell level, for the secondary function22\u201324. This is done in a low throughput manner, separately testing each candidate.",
                "The platform we describe here aims at achieving this goal and selects oligonucleotides with defined therapeutic functions, such as target cell apoptosis. The platform screens the oligonucleotide pool for the desired function, looking only for a chosen biological effect at the live cell level. A remarkable consequence of this feature is that the platform does not require any a priori biological knowledge about the target, such as which cell type it is, which surface markers it expresses, which mutations its genome or epigenome carry, and which current chemotherapies it is already resistant to. The platform only requires a clear identification of the input cells as the target or as a negative target.",
                "This report describes the successful implementation of the platform on tumor cell lines as well as primary, patient-derived cells, resulting in the discovery of oligonucleotides capable of inducing selective and robust apoptotic response in these cells. The platform is found to be sufficiently robust to be highly reproducible in light of the variable nature of the targets. We describe the isolation of a particular, 54-nt oligonucleotide termed E8, which selectively induces apoptosis in patient-derived triple negative breast cancer cells. A polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified version of E8 exhibited favorable biodistribution in animals, persistence in target tumors up to 48\u2009hours after injection, and safety in human blood. Importantly, in patient-derived xenograft mice, E8 showed tumor reduction of approximately 50% within 10 days of treatment, and a robust effect in ex vivo organ cultures taken from chemotherapy-resistant triple negative breast cancer patients. With further improvement, these findings could lead to a drug discovery model which is target-tailored, mechanism-flexible, and nearly on-demand."

                        "The platform\u2019s workflow consists of two stages. The purpose of the first stage is to enrich a random initial single-stranded oligonucleotide library (~1015) for specific target binders, however without notable reduction of its diversity. This is done by three rounds of a conventional cell-SELEX process (Supplementary Note\u00a01). The enriched population then exits into the second, functional stage. The crucial challenge of this stage is that candidate functional oligonucleotides distribute evenly across the target cell sample, generating a very low effective concentration and are therefore highly unlikely to generate any noticeable response in cells. To overcome this issue and enhance the signal, we created an emulsion in which the library was dispersed together with microparticles, and performed emulsion PCR (ePCR) to coat each microparticle with multiple copies of a single oligonucleotide, or at most very few different ones. Thus each cluster creates a local high concentration for the oligonucleotide it holds (Supplementary Note\u00a02). The process then starts and continues with the population of clustered oligonucleotides rather than a solution-phase library.",
                        "Each functional round commences by incubating the clustered library with target cells which were loaded with a reporter indicating a desired response, such as apoptosis or cell activation. Following incubation, the cell:cluster mixture is sorted by FACS to isolate cluster+/response+ events. Clusters are then eluted from cells, amplified by PCR, and amplified again by ePCR to generate new clusters for the next round. Two final analyses are then performed: first, all output libraries from the functional stage are experimentally compared in their ability to induce a response in the target cells; this test validates that the process has successfully driven the library towards improvement. Second, analysis by deep sequencing highlights the most successful oligonucleotides for further synthesis and functional validation."

                        "This workflow was verified on a colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT-116. HCT-116 cells first went through 7 rounds of cell-SELEX, followed by a binding assay (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Library enrichment during the process was evaluated by sampling the first round, last round, and 2 selected intermediate rounds. Sampling was done mainly in order to save library material for additional studies. The output library from round 3 was then introduced into the functional stage for an additional 6\u20138 rounds. The functional stage is based on choosing a specific marker or mechanism for targeting by the library. As a functional reporter in this case study, we chose a fluorogenic substrate of activated caspase-3/7 (cas-3/7). This reporter produced a good signal for sorting. Sorting of cluster+/cas-3/7+ events went on for 8 rounds (Fig.\u00a01c). In each round, the incubation time for generating response was 1.5\u2009h. Importantly, cells entering the round being already dead are gated out based on their physical parameters, to prevent enrichment of dead cell-binding oligos, which are a potentially drastic contaminant. Strikingly, a comparison of the output libraries from all functional rounds demonstrated a consistent improvement in the library\u2019s ability to induce cas-3/7 activity in HCT-116 cells (Fig.\u00a01d).Fig. 1Tumoricidal oligonucleotide libraries created by response-directed in vitro evolution.a Consistent enrichment of the binding capacity of a random library during the initial stage of the process, implemented on HCT116, a colorectal cancer cell line.

                        "We repeated this workflow on several tumor targets of human origin: primary triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line, and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TNBC cells (termed TNBC9) were produced from patient-derived xenografts as previously described25. MCF10A cells, a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line26, were used as negative target cells. These runs resulted in oligonucleotide libraries which exerted potent and selective cytotoxicity on the target cells, including those derived directly from patients (Fig.\u00a01e, f, g, h). AML cells (termed AML1) were freshly isolated from patient\u2019s blood (Supplementary Note\u00a03, Supplementary Figs.\u00a01, 2), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a healthy donor were used as negative target cells. Here, too, the process successfully produced a library which induced cas-3/7 activation in AML cells but not in PBMC from a healthy donor (Fig.\u00a01g, h). To evaluate the exclusivity of libraries to the target cells used in their evolution, we examined the ability of the AML library described above (AML1) to induce apoptosis in other AML cells, both freshly-isolated from patients, and a cell line. Interestingly, some target cells exhibited partial resistance to this library, while others were susceptible (Fig.\u00a01i)."

                        "In order to evaluate the applicability of this platform as a therapeutic strategy for cancer, we followed the TNBC9 targeting results with selection of lead molecules. Based on sequencing analysis (Fig.\u00a02a), 10 candidate oligonucleotides were selected, synthesized, and folded. We did not observe significant homology (p\u2009=\u20090.1) within the sequence group or within the structures (Supplementary Table\u00a01, Supplementary Note\u00a04, Supplementary Figs.\u00a03\u20135). The effectiveness of these candidates in target killing was measured on the PDX-derived TNBC9 cells, highlighting a single oligonucleotide, termed E8, as the most effective (Fig.\u00a02b). A simulation and prediction of the 3D structure of E8 was performed (Fig.\u00a02c, Supplementary Note\u00a05, Supplementary Figs.\u00a06\u201312). The observed level of direct target killing by E8 in vitro and ex vivo ranged between ~20\u201340% in independent biological replicate experiments, which is comparable to the levels observed with approved anti-cancer biologicals27\u201329. E8 demonstrated remarkable selectivity at the target cell level, killing TNBC9 but not MCF10A cells, which were used as negative targets in the in vitro evolution process (Fig.\u00a02d). E8 was not exclusive to TNBC9 and showed a remarkable effect on MDA-MB-231 cells as well (Fig.\u00a02e). In preparation for in vivo testing, these effects were re-validated using E8 modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), a modification that extends in vivo stability and half-life of the oligonucleotide, demonstrating that the effect was retained with PEG (Fig.\u00a02f). In addition, E8 retained function in mouse serum (Fig.\u00a02g).Fig. 2Identification of a lead candidate, E8, from a tumoricidal oligo library.Cell types are denoted in the top left corner of plots. a Sequence abundance plot from a representative response-directed in vitro evolution run.

                        "To determine the dispersion of E8 we used fluorescently-labeled E8 as previously described for aptamer in vivo imaging probes30\u201332. The molecule, modified with 5\u2019-Cy5.5 and 3\u2019-PEG, was injected intravenously in two doses (6 and 60\u2009mg/kg) into NOD/SCID mice in which MDA-MB-231 tumors were induced. These experiments showed that E8 localizes to and is remarkably retained in the tumors at 24 and 48\u2009h post injection (Fig.\u00a03a, b, c). Fluorescently-labeled control oligos have consistently shown no accumulation in the tumors, and were localized to the liver and kidneys as rapidly as 30\u2009min (Supplementary Note\u00a06, Supplementary Figs.\u00a013\u201314), in agreement with previously reported studies30,31. Multiple experiments with random sequence controls revealed no significant protease resistance of E8 (p\u2009=\u20090.08) which could be attributed to its structure. We therefore concluded that this persistence is most likely due to PEGylation of E8. Furthermore, when E8 was mixed with whole human blood from healthy donors, no hemolysis, agglutination, or cytokine responses were observed (Supplementary Note\u00a07, Supplementary Figs.\u00a015\u201317).Fig. 3E8 biodistribution and efficacy in an animal model.a E8, modified with Cy5.5 and PEG, was injected at 6 or 60\u2009mg/kg, i.v. into NOD/SCID mice bearing MDA-MB-231-derived tumors on their right hind limb.

This platform could potentially address the central limitations of our current model of drug discovery. Particularly, this platform receives a human sample and operates a specific algorithm to generate a new therapeutic molecule tailored to the sample. The current algorithm can be improved based on our findings. For example, these findings indicate that output libraries and candidate oligos are not absolutely exclusive to the target cells used as input in their evolution process. Therefore, the personalized algorithm should include an early step that screens any incoming sample against the library of previously-generated oligonucleotides, to shunt directly to synthesis in case effective and selective candidates are found. The algorithm is still personalized per sample, but such decision trees could tremendously improve its efficiency. We are also currently improving methods for candidate selection from sequencing data, based on parameters orthogonal to abundance.",
                "A crucial factor in the success of target-tailored therapy is discovery speed. In developing the described approach, an emphasis has been put in confining the overall discovery time to several days, which is within the time scale of approved personalized therapies such as CAR-T cells. It is important to note, that some recent methods for the selection of aptamers are significantly faster than this: several reported methods require only a single round of selection to identify monovalent and bivalent aptamers34\u201336. Additional efficient modalities for aptamer selection include capillary electrophoresis37\u201339 and magnetic sorting40. Electrophoresis and magnetic beads have been combined with microfluidics to create integrated systems for aptamer selection41\u201343. All these methods have demonstrated that aptamer selection could be significantly sped up and multiplexed. Moreover, recent works have explored new ways for enhancing functional selection capabilities, with remarkable results. For example, an in vivo selection method has successfully identified aptamers capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier44. A method termed pheno-SELEX has been developed to select aptamers specifically against the invasive phenotype of tumor cells45. We note that these and other works, also reviewed elsewhere46, highlight the potential of selecting functional aptamers rapidly and efficiently, and could significantly improve our approach for discovering therapeutic oligonucleotides.",

Central to this challenge is the profound asymmetry between the period of time required for the development of a new antibiotic and the period of time required for targets to develop resistance to it: while new drugs require on average more than 10 years and $2.6B to develop47, antibiotic resistance in bacteria could arise within a few generations, or on the scale of hours48,49, rendering the pharmaceutical industry extremely limited in dealing with this challenge. The present platform could offer a significant advantage in this battle. Interestingly, oligonucleotides have the additional unique advantage of being \u201cdigitizable\u201d; they can be distributed as electronic sequence files and synthesized locally, owing to their facile synthesis. We have recently shown using network models that this concept formulates the most effective strategy to date to mitigate global pandemics50. Coupled with an ultra-rapid discovery system, a tool is created which, arguably, must be pursued."

Randomization was done by hand mixing at IDT. All libraries passed in-house QC of uniformity by HPLC prior to usage. Libraries were reconstituted in ultrapure water at a stock concentration of 1\u2009mM. Cell-SELEX was performed as follows. An ssDNA library constructed of a random core flanked by constant regions is folded in the presence of constant region-complementary oligonucleotides (termed caps). Folding was carried out by incubation at 95 \u00b0C for 5\u2009min, cooling on ice for 10\u2009min, and an additional 10\u2009min incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Folded library and cells were incubated together in the target cell medium supplemented with 10% human serum for 1\u2009h. Library concentration in the incubation step was set to 500\u2009nM. After each round, the sample was washed to dilute unbound candidates 104- fold for the first selection round and 106-fold from the second round forth. To prepare the next round\u2019s input library, the bound fraction was eluted by incubation at 95 \u00b0C for 10\u2009min. From the 2nd round on a negative selection was added. The eluted library was folded again and incubated with the non-target cells as described above, this time the unbound fraction is taken as an input for an asymmetric PCR (aPCR) process. ssDNA was purified from the aPCR product using preparative HPLC on an Agilent 1100 instrument. Samples of output libraries from all rounds were stored for evaluation."
