    "abstract": "A chimeric DNA:RNA guide for very high accuracy Cas9 genome editing employs nucleotide-type substitutions in nucleic acid-guided endonucleases for enhanced specificity. The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system is manipulated to generate chimeric DNA:RNA guide strands to minimize the off-target cleavage events of the S. pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease. A DNA:RNA chimeric guide strand is sufficient to guide Cas9 to a specified target sequence for indel formation and minimize off-target cleavage events due to the specificity conferred by DNA-DNA interactions. Use of chimeric mismatch-evading lowered-thermostability guides (\u201cmelt-guides\u201d) demonstrate that nucleotide-type substitutions in the spacer can reduce cleavage of sequences mismatched by as few as a single base pair. The chimeric mismatch-evading lowered-thermostability guides replace most gRNA spacer positions with DNA bases to suppress mismatched targets under Cas9's catalytic threshold.",

                        "An efficient, reliable mechanism of making precise, targeted changes to the genomes of living cells is a critical goal of biomedicine. The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, where a short RNA strand (sgRNA) guides the Cas9 enzyme to a specific target sequence for double-stranded DNA cleavage [Jinek, et al. A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity. Science 337, 816-821 (2012)], has thus generated considerable excitement. However, the targeting and cleavage activity of Cas9 often results in off-target DNA modifications, which seriously limits its applications [Mali, et al., \u201cCAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering\u201d, Nature Biotechnology 31, 833-838 (2013)]. There have been several studies aimed at improving DNA off-target cleavage, including a double-nicking approach consisting of using the nickase variant of Cas9 with a pair of offset sgRNAs properly positioned on the target DNA2, truncated guide RNAs utilized in conjunction with the double nicking strategy [Fu, et al., \u201cImproving CRISPR-Cas nuclease specificity using truncated guide RNAs\u201d, Nature Biotechnology 32, 279-284 (2014)], and an RNA-guided dCas9 fused to the FokI nuclease where two fused dCas9-FokI monomers can simultaneously bind target sites at a defined distance apart [Guilinger, et al., \u201cFusion of catalytically inactive Cas9 to FokI nuclease improves the specificity of genome modification\u201d, Nature Biotechnology 32, 577-582 (2014); Tsai, et al., \u201cDimeric CRISPR RNA-guided FokI nucleases for highly specific genome editing\u201d, Nature Biotechnology 32, 569-576 (2014)]. Few approaches, however, focus specifically on the strand invasion of the sgRNA and its stability within the target DNA.",
                        "Recent discoveries, characterizations, and modifications of natural nucleic acid-guided endonucleases (NGEns), such as CRISPR and RNAi, have resulted in their widespread use for genome editing, probing, and regulation [Wilson, R. C. & Doudna, J. A., \u201cMolecular mechanisms of RNA interference\u201d, Annual review of biophysics 42, 217-239 (2013); Sander, J. D. & Joung, J.

A. & Qi, L. S., \u201cBeyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation\u201d, Nature reviews. Molecular cell biology 17, 5-15 (2016)]. Unlike prior work on engineering modular proteins to recognize double-stranded DNA, NGEns are significantly less expensive to assemble and more straightforward to design, while maintaining similar specificity for the intended genomic target [Gaj, T.; Gersbach, C. A. & Barbas, C. F., \u201cZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering\u201d, Trends in biotechnology 31, 397-405 (2013); Ul Ain, Q.; Chung, J.

                        "Since applications like gene therapy may demand negligible off target effects, many efforts have focused on new mechanisms to control and tune the binding and cleavage of NGEns [Tsai, S. Q.; Zheng, Z.; Nguyen, N. T.; Liebers, M.; Topkar, V. V.; Thapar, V.; Wyvekens, N.; Khayter, C.; Iafrate, A. J.; Le, L. P.; Aryee, M. J. & Joung, J.

R., \u201cChemical Biology Approaches to Genome Editing: Understanding, Controlling, and Delivering Programmable Nucleases\u201d, Cell chemical biology 23, 57-73 (2016)]. Several approaches include coupling the activity of the system to chemical or physical stimuli, requiring co-localized concurrent recognition of targets, or making subtle biochemical modifications that influence recognition kinetics [Ran, F. A.; Hsu, P. D.; Lin, C.-Y.; Gootenberg, J. S.; Konermann, S.; Trevino, A. E.; Scott, D.

N., \u201cDevelopment of Light-Activated CRISPR Using Guide RNAs with Photocleavable Protectors\u201d, Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English) 55, 12440-12444 (2016)].",
                        "Several strategies for influencing recognition kinetics have exploited the sequential hybridization between an NGEn's invading guide and one strand of the DNA target (target strand), which is incrementally displaced from the non-target strand [Fu, Y.; Reyon, D. & Joung, J. K., \u201cTargeted genome editing in human cells using CRISPR/Cas nucleases and truncated guide RNAs\u201d, Methods in enzymology 546, 21-45 (2014); Liu, Y.; Zhan, Y.; Chen, Z.; He, A.; Li, J.; Wu, H.; Liu, L.; Zhuang, C.; Lin, J.; Guo, X.; Zhang, Q.; Huang, W. & Cai, Z., \u201cDirecting cellular information flow via CRISPR signal conductors\u201d, Nature methods 13, 938-944 (2016)]. Such three-stranded structures are referred to as R-loops, when the invading strand is RNA, and D-loops, when the invading strand is DNA. The size of an R-loop and D-loop can serve as an allosteric switch for an NGEns cleavage activity [Kiani, S.; Chavez, A.; Tuttle, M.; Hall, R. N.; Chari, R.; Ter-Ovanesyan, D.; Qian, J.; Pruitt, B. W.; Beal, J.; Vora, S. et al., \u201cCas9 gRNA engineering for genome editing, activation and repression\u201d, Nature methods 12(11), 1051-1054 (2015); Lim, Y.; Bak, S.

K., \u201cStructural roles of guide RNAs in the nuclease activity of Cas9 endonuclease\u201d, Nature Communications 7, 13350 (2016)]. Since an NGEn endonuclease like Cas9 partially stabilizes the R-loop, efforts have identified Cas9 variants with reduced R-loop stabilization and increased reliance on RNA-DNA base-pairing energies to maintain and extend the R-loop [Slaymaker, I. M.; Gao, L.; Zetsche, B.; Scott, D. A.; Yan, W. X. & Zhang, F., \u201cRationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity\u201d, Science 351, 84-88 (2016)]. Similarly, other efforts have either extended or truncated the NGEn's guide to modify the R-loop's stability [Josephs, E. A.; Kocak, D. D.; Fitzgibbon, C. J.; McMenemy, J.; Gersbach, C. A. & Marszalek, P. E., \u201cStructure and specificity of the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 during DNA interrogation, target binding and cleavage\u201d, Nucleic acids research 43, 8924-8941 (2015)].",
                        "Oligonucleotide-guided nucleases (OGNs) have enabled rapid advances in precision genome engineering. Though much effort has gone into characterizing and mitigating mismatch tolerance for the most widely adopted OGN, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), potential off-target interactions may still limit applications where on-target specificity is critical. The recent discoveries, characterizations, and modifications of natural oligonucleotide-guided nucleases associated with CRISPR and RNAi have empowered a genome-editing revolution [Jinek, M. et al., \u201cRNA-programmed genome editing in human cells\u201d, eLife 2, e00471 (2013); Mali, P. et al., \u201cRNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9\u201d, Science 339, 823-826 (2013); Cong, L. et al., \u201cMultiplex genome engineering using crispr/cas systems\u201d, Science 339, 819-823 (2013); Komor, A. C., Badran, A. H. & Liu, D. R., \u201cCRISPR-based technologies for the manipulation of eukaryotic genomes\u201d, Cell 168, 20-36 (2017)]. Low barriers for OGNs' cost and design drive their widespread adoption over alternatives, including modular base-recognition domains (i.e., transcription activator like effector, zinc finger, and pumilio assemblies), which can be hard to synthesize, or meganucleases, which are difficult to engineer for new targets [Reyon, D. et al., \u201cFlash assembly of talens for high-throughput genome editing\u201d, Nature biotechnology 30, 460-465 (2012); Ramirez, C. L. et al., \u201cUnexpected failure rates for modular assembly of engineered zinc fingers\u201d, Nature methods 5, 374-375 (2008); Adamala, K. P., Martin-Alarcon, D. A. & Boyden, E.

Unlike protein-directed systems, OGNs also permit employing predictable nucleic acid chemistry and biophysics to alternative features [Hendel, A. et al., \u201cChemically modified guide RNAs enhance CRISPR-Cas genome editing in human primary cells\u201d, Nature biotechnology 33, 985-989 (2015); Jain, P.

                        "Among the most important properties dictating the usage of a nucleic acid recognition system is its specificity. Thus, the desire to identify new methods diminishing potentially toxic or detrimental off-target activity has prompted many to measure and improve mismatch discrimination for RNA-guided SpCas9\u2014the most prevalent OGN [Schaefer, K. A. et al., \u201cUnexpected mutations after CRISPR-Cas9 editing in vivo\u201d, Nature methods 14, 547-548 (2017); Tsai, S.

G. et al., \u201cOptimized sgRNA design to maximize activity and minimize off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9\u201d, Nature biotechnology 34, 184-191 (2016)]. Up to now, others have increased its precision through broad approaches, such as controlling duration of exposure, enforcing co-localization on adjacent targets, or destabilizing binding affinity by minor variation [Davis, K.

The central premise is that the RNA component of the guide molecule is sufficient for strand invasion into the duplex DNA target, and the DNA motif will confer added specificity. This hypothesis was formulated due to relatively weaker DNA-DNA interactions, as compared to RNA-DNA interactions [Lesnik, et al., \u201cRelative Thermodynamic Stability of DNA, RNA, and DNA:RNA Hybrid Duplexes: Relationship with Base Composition and Structure\u201d, Biochemistry 34, 10807-10815 (1995)], which will require increased, if not complete, complementarity for hybridization and stabilization to the target DNA. To test the hypothesis, a design strategy was employed wherein the spacer sequence of the guide molecule primarily consists of DNA, while the spacer bases that interact with Cas9, along with the tracRNA sequence, remain as RNA, to maintain sufficient guide activity.",

To test the hypothesis, an EGFP disruption assay as well as T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) and Sanger sequencing assays were employed to assess successful targeting and quantify the frequency of insertion-deletion mutations. (2) Next Generation Sequencing for enabling high-throughput CRISPR validation and quantifying Off-Target cleavage events. The working hypothesis was that, due to added specificity conferred by DNA-DNA interactions at the spacer sequence on the target DNA, off-target events will be minimal compared to similar published CRISPR-Cas9 modified systems. To test this hypothesis, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was employed, which provides highly sensitive data on the exact nature of the genomic modifications being made.",

Initial attempts yielded unsatisfactorily low mutagenesis, which is believed to have resulted from unfavorable relative rates of: (i) guide oligo degradation, (ii) slower R-loop expansion, and (iii) errorless non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair [Suzuki, K. et al., \u201cIn vivo genome editing via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology-independent targeted integration\u201d, Nature 540, 144149 (2016); Schmid-Burgk, J. L., Hning, K., Ebert, T. S. & Hornung, V., \u201cCrispaint allows modular base-specific gene tagging using a ligase-4-dependent mechanism\u201d, Nature communications 7, 12338 (2016)]. Counteracting degradation with oligo lifetime-lengthening modifications (e.g., phosphorothioate (PS-DNA) or inverted terminal bases and 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA substitutions on non-spacer guide positions) was tried, which partially restored cleavage rates by using fewer DNA substitutions in melt-guides [Hendel, A. et al., \u201cChemically modified guide RNAs enhance CRISPR-Cas genome editing in human primary cells\u201d, Nature biotechnology 33, 985-989 (2015)]. Since these tactics did not lead to substantial improvement, methods were later pursued that could bias genomic double-strand breaks towards more error-prone repair.",
                                "Overexpression of the mammalian 3\u2032 exonuclease Trex2, associated with DNA damage processing, has been reported to raise indel rates for various sequence-specific gene editing systems without causing toxicity [Delacte, F. et al., \u201cHigh frequency targeted mutagenesis using engineered endonucleases and DNA-end processing enzymes\u201d, PloS one 8, e53217 (2013); Certo, M. T. et al., \u201cCoupling endonucleases with DNA end-processing enzymes to drive gene disruption\u201d, Nature methods 9, 973-975 (2012); Chari, R., Mali, P., Moosburner, M. & Church, G. M., \u201cUnraveling CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering parameters via a library-on-library approach\u201d, Nature methods 12, 823-826 (2015)]. Therefore, Trex2 expression plasmid was added to transfections and effected mutations were measured by deep sequencing [Pinello, L. et al., \u201cAnalyzing CRISPR genome-editing experiments with CRISPResso\u201d, Nature biotechnology 34, 695-697 (2016)].",
                                "FIG. 20 is a dual y-axis chart showing deep sequencing indel measurements on-target and at a known off-target, comparing mutagenesis by gRNA to melt-guides designed with DNA substitutions in their first 11 positions with and without Trex2 overexpression (blue and light blue, respectively). Nucleic acid-type content in the guide's spacer is noted in parentheses. It was found that a melt-guide containing mostly DNA in spacer bases produced indel percentages above 25% on-target, which acceptably translates to 70% gRNA's rate. Crucially, on an off-target where gRNA-induced mutations were detected, melt-guides' indel percentages fell below the no-guide negative control. Between melt-guide types, single-molecule gRNA (sgRNA) length melt-guides consistently generated more than double the indel rate of melt-guides derived from shorter CRISPR RNA (crRNA) sequence, which need to duplex with trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Despite Trex2 addition increasing indel percentages roughly seven-fold for both melt-guide types, the exonuclease had marginal impact on gRNA-directed mutation rates.",
                                "Others have achieved enhanced Cas9 specificity and could maintain high indel rates on-target without an accessory exonuclease [Kleinstiver, B. P. et al., \u201cHigh-fidelity CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with no detectable genome-wide off-target effects\u201d, Nature 529, 490-495 (2016); Slaymaker, I. M. et al., \u201cRationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity\u201d, Science (New York, N.Y.) 351, 84-88 (2016)]. However, these experiments relied on transcribing all OGN components to abundant cellular concentrations. On one hand, a similar Trex2 supplementation strategy may benefit applications where some components are delivered as oligo or protein\u2014which may include DNA-guided editing with Argonaute [Enghiad, B. & Zhao, H., \u201cProgrammable DNA-guided artificial restriction enzymes\u201d, ACS synthetic biology 6, 752-757 (2017); Lee, S. H. et al., \u201cFailure to detect DNA-guided genome editing using natronobacterium gregoryi argonaute\u201d, Nature biotechnology 35, 17-18 (2016)]. On the other hand, a reverse-transcribable melt-guide with only DNA bases could lessen dependence on Trex2 for efficient mutagenesis. Towards that end, we show in vitro cleavage directed by tracrRNA in duplex with a crRNA-length melt-guide containing a single RNA outside of the spacer sequence. FIG. 21 is an inverted gel image of Cas9 digest of no-mismatch VEGFA site 1 target with almost all-DNA melt-guide of crRNA-length. Chimeras with such sparse RNA content are furthermore likely resistant to most Rnases.",

FIGS. 22A-B depict a T7EI endonuclease assay on genomic EMX amplicons and a reported off-target upon mutagenesis by lipofection of protein Cas9 pre-assembled with either gRNA or melt-guide. The T7EI endonuclease assay of FIGS. 22A-B measures gene-editing on genomic EMX amplicons and those of its most-likely off-target upon Cas9 mutagenesis with either gRNA or Melt-guide containing 15 RNA bases and DNA bases. Similarly, by combining the specificity conferred by orthogonal specificity-enhancing methods, such as high-fidelity protein variants and truncated-guide RNA, the RNA/DNA content in a Melt-guide can be distributed to take advantage of when these methods permit synergistic, additive, or cooperative specificity.",

The next day, transfections via TransIT-X2 reagent (Minis Bio) delivered a 25 nM final concentration of guide with or without 2.5 pExodus CMV.Trex2, which was a gift from Dr. Andrew Scharenberg (Addgene plasmid #40210). After an additional 48 hours, genomic DNA was isolated using Epicentre QuickExtract solution and indel production was visualized by a common T7 Endonuclease I assay (NEB) on amplicons from on-target and known off-target regions that were denatured and re-annealed [Vouillot, L., Thlie, A. & Pollet, N., \u201cComparison of T7E1 and surveyor mismatch cleavage assays to detect mutations triggered by engineered nucleases\u201d, G3 5, 407-415 (2015)]. Amplicons were then prepared for deep sequencing with Nextera-XT tagmentation (Illumina) and run on a MiSeq 2\u00d7300 v3 kit (Illumina). Reads were analyzed using the CRISPResso software pipeline for precise indel percentages from biological and technical duplicates [Pinello, L. et al., \u201cAnalyzing CRISPR genome-editing experiments with CRISPResso\u201d, Nature biotechnology 34, 695-697 (2016)].",

Melt-guides should be extensible to the expanding collection of CRISPR systems by extrapolating either from chimeric oligo libraries to scan nucleotide-type substitution or from published crystal structure data to avoid disrupting RNA-specific interactions (i.e., Cpf1 guide's pseudoknots) [Yamano, T. et al., \u201cCrystal structure of cpfl in complex with guide RNA and target DNA\u201d, Cell 165, 949-962 (2016); Burstein, D. et al., \u201cNew CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated microbes\u201d, Nature 542, 237-241 (2017)].

It also has the potential for a positive translational impact by minimizing the risks associated with human genomic modifications in clinical settings.
