The transmitting coil 12 may be a coil that is utilized in an inductive charging system. Moreover, inductive charging occurs when an alternating current passes through the transmitting coil 12 and creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field emitted from the transmitting coil 12 fluctuates in strength as the alternating current is continually changing velocity. This magnetic field emitted from the transmitting coil 12 causes an alternating electrical current in the receiving coil.",

However, it should be understood that the system 10 may utilize as few as two measurement coils. The use of additional measurement coils allows for additional properties, such as the position of the transmitting coil 12 to be determined by the system 10. The measurement coils 14, 16, 18, and 20 are generally wound in opposite directions. Moreover, when two measurement coils are utilized, one measurement coil is wound in one direction, while the other measurement coil is wound in another direction. If three measurement coils are utilized, two measurement coils are wound in one direction, while the third measurement coil is wound in the opposite direction. Similarly, if four measurement coils are utilized, two of the measurement coils are wound in one direction, while the other two measurement coils are wound in the opposite direction.",

In this example, the measurement coils 14 and 16 each have a length of approximately 150 mm and a radius of approximately 50 mm. The distance between the centers of the measurement coils 14 and 16 is approximately 110 mm. As such, the space between the measurement coils 14 and 16 is approximately 10 mm. The wire radius for the measurement coils 14 and 16 is approximately 0.5 mm, and the number of turns that form the measurement coils 14 and 16 are approximately 46. It should be understood that this is just but one example of the dimensions utilized for the measurement coils 14 and 16. Any one of a number of different dimensions can be utilized.",

By \u201csubstantially similar\u201d it should be understood this to mean a 10% variance. Similarly, the transmitting coil 12 may have a substantially similar resonant frequency to one or all of the measurement coils 14, 16, 18 and/or 20.

Different methodologies for selecting the frequency will be described later in this specification, including a description of what frequencies may be more helpful and/or more preferred than others.",

As such, in one example, only measurement coils 14 and 16 may be utilized, but in other examples, more than two measurement coils may be utilized. As to the general placement of the measurement coils with respect to each other, when two measurement coils are utilized, the {01178327} 7 measurement coils 14 and 16 may be adjacent to one another as indicated in FIG. 3A. If three measurement coils are utilized, the measurement coils 14, 16, and 18 may be arranged in a triangular pattern, as shown in FIG. 3B.

The receiving coil 56 essentially receives the magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil 12 of FIG. 1 and generates a current in response to receiving the magnetic field from the transmitting coil 12. The current generated in the receiving coil 56 can be fed to a battery management system 52, which can then be used to charge a battery pack 54. The battery pack 54 could be a battery pack of any one of a number of different electronic devices, including small electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablet devices, and the like but could also include large devices such as vehicles.

In this example, the transmitting coil 12 has a radius of 750 mm, a length of 100 mm, a wire radius of 0.5 mm, a number of turns of 2.265, and is a right-handed wound coil. It should be understood that the transmitting coil 12 is not limited to these dimensions described above and can be any dimensions that allow the transmitting coil 12 to generate and emit a magnetic field.",

The transmitting coil 12 is located at a distance 40 of 3 meters from a midpoint 43 of the measurement coils 14 and 16, but it should be understood that any distance could be realized. Further, the angle of incidence 41 between the transmitting coil 12 and the midpoint 43 of the measurement coils 14 and 16 is 30\u00b0. Again, this is just an example in any angle of incidence could be utilized.",
                        "As stated before, the measurement coils 14 and 16 may have dimensions similar to the measurement coils mentioned in FIG. 2. Furthermore, one of the measurement coils 14 may be wound in one direction (such as a left-handed direction) and the other measurement coil 16 may be wound in the opposite direction (such as a right-handed direction). Generally, the resonant frequency of the measurement coils 14 and 16 are substantially similar. Further, the {01178327} 8 resonant frequency of the measurement coils 14 and 16, as well as the transmitting coil 12, may also all be substantially similar.",
                        "When the transmitting coil 12 generates a magnetic field, the magnetic field generated by the measurement coils 14 and 16 in response to the magnetic field from the transmitting coil 12 may differ based on the fact that the measurement coils 14 and 16 are wound in opposite directions. An example of the magnetic field generated by the measurement coils 14 and 16 in response to the magnetic field from the transmitting coil 12 is illustrated in FIG. 5.",
                        "When one measures the voltages of each of the measurement coils 14 and 16 at a predetermined frequency and then compares the ratio of the voltages measured, the system 10 has the ability to determine one or more characteristics of the transmitting coil 12, such as the direction that the transmitting coil 12 is wound and/or the angle of incidence 41 that the transmitting coil 12 is in respect to the midpoint 43 between the measurement coils 14 and 16.",
                        "Coils 12, 16, and 14 are labeled as 1, 2, and 3 for, respectively. The scattering matrix components have the forms of S21=V2/V1 and, S31=V3/V1, where V1, V2, and V3 are the voltages of the three coils labeled with 1, 2, and 3. (The voltage terminal is located at the middle of each coil.) Thus, S21/S31 represents the voltage ratio of V2/V3, and we use S21 and S31 for evaluating the voltage ratio. For example, referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B, S21 is the voltage measured in the measurement coil 16, while S31 represents the voltage measured in the measurement coil 14 in response to the magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil 12. FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrates the ratio of the voltage |S21| to |S31|. The values of the ratios may be generated based on the absolute values of the voltages S21 and S31.",
                        "In addition, FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrates the ratio of the voltages |S21| (coil 16) to |S31| (coil 14) at different predetermined frequencies (such as 11.3 MHz, 11.7 MHz, and 10 MHz) as well as when the transmitting coil 12 is at different angles of incidence 41 with respect to the midpoint 43 of the measurement coils 14 and 16. The frequencies 11.3 MHz, 11.7 MHz, and 10 MHz are merely examples of different frequencies that can be utilized when measuring the voltages generated by the measurement coils 14 and/or 16.",
                        "As can be seen in FIG. 6A, the ratio of the voltages |S21| to |S31| generally varies as the angle of incidence 41 of the transmitting coil 12 varies. However, the frequency of 11.7 MHz creates a superior one-to-one set of values. Moreover, if one utilizes 11.7 MHz as the predetermined frequency for measuring the voltages of the measurement coils 14 and 16 when {01178327} 9 the transmitting coil 12 is between \u221260\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 angle 41 of incidence, one can utilize the ISA to ISA ratio to determine the angle of incidence of the transmitting coil 12 from \u221260\u00b0 to 60\u00b0.",
                        "When a system only requires a narrow angle range e.g. from \u221230\u00b0 to 30\u00b0, one can utilize 11.3 MHz, which gives higher sensitivity (voltage ratio per angle) than the use of 11.7 MHz. Instead, one needs to care that some of the values are repeated out of the angle range from \u221230\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 and, therefore, could cause a miscalculation. For example, at 11.3 MHz, the ISA to ISA ratio is the same at approximately 60\u00b0 as it is at approximately \u221225\u00b0. In addition, one can use another frequency of 10 MHz. In this case, selecting the ratio of |S31|/|S21|, which is the inverse of |S21|/|S31|, shows a similar angular response as the case of 11.7 MHz, as shown in FIG. 6B. Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, the measurement of the voltages S31 (solid line, coil 14) and S21 (dotted line, coil 16) from different frequencies between 8 MHZ and 12 MHz are shown at an angle of incidence 41 at \u221230\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, respectively.",
                        "As stated before, one of the characteristics of the transmitting coil 12 that can be determined is the angle of incidence 41 by measuring the voltages of the measurement coils 14 and 16 and comparing the ratio of the measurement coils 14 and 16 at a predetermined frequency. However, in addition to determining the angle of incidence 41, other characteristics can also be determined.",
                        "Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10, an example of a transmitting coil 12 is shown with respect to the measurement coils 14 and 16. In this example, the transmitting coil 12 is a right-handed wound coil, the measurement coil 14 is a left-handed wound coil and the measurement coil 16 is a right-handed coil. As best shown in FIG. 10, the ratio of the voltages of the measurement coils 14 and 16 are shown at a normal angle of incidence (i.e., 0\u00b0) and at a range of frequencies between 8 MHz and 12 MHz.",
                        "However, if the transmitting coil 12 was a left-handed transmitting coil, the ratio between the voltages S31 and S21 would switch. As such, S21 would mimic S31, while S31 would mimic S21 of FIG. 10. As such, using this information, the system 10 can also determine if the transmitting coil 12 is a left-handed wound transmitting coil or right-handed wound transmitting coil.",
                        "FIGS. 11A-11D illustrate the magnetic fields generated by the transmitting coil 12 as it interacts with the measurement coils 14 and 16 at different frequencies of 8.24 MHz, 10 MHz, 10.71 MHz and 11.7 MHz. The way that the magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil 12 interacts with the measurement coils 14 and 16 would be reversed if the transmitting coil 12 was changed from a right-handed coil to a left-handed coil. As such, using this information, the system 10 can determine based on the ratio between the voltages of the measurement coils 14 and 16 the direction that the transmitting coil 12 is wound.",
                        "It should be understood that this ratio is generated because one of the measurement coils 14 is wound in one direction, while the other measurement coil 16 is wound in the opposite direction. If both measurement coils 14 and 16 are wound in the same direction, the voltages measured would be identical and thus not create a ratio between them and therefore could not be utilized to determine one or more characteristics of the transmitting coil 12.",
                        "As such, based on the ratio between the voltages from the measurement coils 14 and 16, the system 10 can determine an angle of incidence 41 of the transmitting coil 12 with respect to the measurement coils 14 and 16. Knowledge of the angle of incidence 41 and/or the direction that the transmitting coil 12 is wound can be used by a battery management system so as to more efficiently charge any battery connected to a receiving coil, such as receiving coil 56 of FIG. 3D.",
                        "It should also be understood that if additional measurement coils are utilized, such as a third measurement coil 18 and/or fourth measuring coil 20, additional measurements and therefore characteristics can be determined regarding the transmitting coil 12. Referring to FIG. 12, illustrated is an example of a transmitting coil 12 along with four measurement coils 14, 16, 18, and 20 arranged in a rectangular orientation. The measurement coils 14 and 18 are wound in one direction, while the measurement coils 16 and 20 are wound in another direction. A midpoint 43A is located between the measurement coils 14 and 16, a midpoint 43B is located between the measurement coils 16 and 18, a midpoint 43C is located between the measurement coils 18 and 20, and a midpoint 43D is located between the measurement coils 14 and 20.",
                        "Using the methodology previously described, the system can determine the angles of incidence 41A, 41B, 41C, and 41D between the midpoints 43A, 43B, 43C, and 43D, respectively, and the center of the magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil 12. Using the angles of incidence 41A-41D, and the known positions of the measurement coils 14, 16, 18, and 20, the system 10 can determine the location of the transmitting coil 12 in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space by determining the location of where the angles of incidence converge 41A-41D. The point 45 is where the angles of incidence converge and can be utilized to determine the location of the transmitting coil 12.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 13, a method 100 for determining one or more characteristics of the transmitting coil, such as transmitting coil 12, is shown. The method 100 is described from the perspective of the system 10 of FIG. 1 and the example shown in FIG. 4. However, it should be understood that the method 100 may be practiced in any one of a number of different ways and is not necessarily dependent on utilizing the system 10 of FIG. 1 as described. The method 100 begins at step 102, wherein the coil characteristic module 28 causes the processor 22 to measure a first voltage of a first measurement coil 14. The measurement of the first voltage of the first measurement coil 14 may be performed by a voltage measuring device 24 which measures the voltage of the first measurement coil 14 that was generated in response to receiving a magnetic field from the transmitting coil 12. The measurement of the first voltage of the first measurement coil 14 may be performed at a predetermined frequency. In one example, the predetermined frequency may be 11.7 MHz, but any frequency may be utilized.",
                        "In step 104, similarly to step 102, the coil characteristic module 28 causes the processor 22 to measure a second voltage of a second measurement coil 16 using the voltage measuring device 24. Again, this voltage of the second measurement coil 16 is produced in response to receiving a magnetic field from the transmitting coil 12. Like before, the measurement of the second measurement coil 16 may be performed at a predetermined frequency. In one example, the predetermined frequency may be 11.7 MHz, but any frequency may be utilized. Generally, it may be preferred that the same frequency be utilized in performing multiple measurements of multiple coils.",
                        "In the method 100, while only two measurements are taken of two measurement coils 14 and 16, it should be understood that, as explained previously, the system 10 could include any one of a number of different coils. Based on a number of coils, the steps 102 and/or 104 may be repeated for each additional set of coils.",
                        "In step 106, the coil characteristic module 28 causes the processor 22 to determine at least one characteristic of the transmitting coil 12 based on a ratio between the first and second voltages. Based on this ratio, one or more characteristics of the transmitting coil can be determined. As previously described, these characteristics could include the direction that the transmitting coil 12 is wound and/or the angle of incidence from the magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil 12 to a location located between the measurement coils 14 and 16. If more than two coils are utilized, multiple angles of incidence can be determined between the multiple coils and the transmitting coil 12. By determining multiple angles of incidence and using the known positions of the multiple measurement coils, a two-dimensional or three-dimensional location of the origin of the magnetic field generated by the transmitting coil 12 and therefore the position of the transmitting coil 12 can be determined. The method 100 may be performed once or may be performed in multiple iterations.",
