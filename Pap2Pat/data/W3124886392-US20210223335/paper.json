    "abstract": "A magnetically coupled three-coil system to have one transmitting and two receiving coils is considered. We show that the position of the transmitting coil can be estimated from the ratio of received wave amplitudes and its angular derivative when the two receiving coils are strongly coupled to each other and each of the receiving coils is weakly coupled to the transmitting coil, i.e., a Fano resonance phenomenon. A coupled mode theory is developed to elucidate the midrange position sensing mechanism, where the ratio of received wave amplitudes is inversely proportional to the ratio of the coupling strengths of each receiving coil to the transmitting coil at the intrinsic resonance frequency of the receiving coils.",

                "Midrange coupling via magnetic fields in the kilohertzmegahertz range has been extensively explored in wireless power transfer [1]- [16], and found various application scenarios in consumer electronics [17], [18], electric vehicles [19]- [22], and medical implants [23]- [25]. Estimating the position of a magnetic coil in the midrange is of great importance in wireless power transfer systems for improving system performances [26]. In electromagnetic compatibility, magnetic noise sources need to be found and suppressed [27], [28]. Particularly, in the development of electric vehicles, a dominant noise source, such as common mode noise generated from a power converter during switching operation, must be identified [29].",
                "Fano resonance occurs from the interference between direct and resonance-assisted indirect pathways, and exhibits an asymmetric line shape in the frequency response [30]- [33]. Recently, in the far-field regime, an angle estimation technique of an incoming wave in a subwavelength size has been studied in optics [34] and acoustics [35], where two waveguides or resonators are strongly coupled in the receiver, and the ratio of the two received wave amplitudes estimates an angle of the incoming wave.",

                "Inspired by the far-field angle sensing technique, here we extend the analogy to the kilohertz-megahertz range where no phase rotation occurs between a transmitter and a receiver. We show that in a magnetically-coupled system consisting of one transmitting and two receiving coils, both the angle and the distance of the transmitting coil can be estimated from the ratio of received wave amplitudes and its angular derivative when the two receiving coils are strongly coupled to each other and each of the receiving coils is weakly coupled to the transmitting coil. Our result indicates the possibility to estimate the position of a noise source with a pair of coils, assuming the transmitting coil as a noise source. A coupled mode theory is developed to elucidate the midrange position sensing mechanism.",
                "In [26], a receiving coil was moved parallel above an array of transmitting coils with each having a switch, and the position of the receiving coil was estimated from the comparison of a measured input impedance at each transmitter to numerical data sets. In that system, the distance between the receiving coil and the array of transmitting coils was fixed and a known parameter. Whereas our system is able to estimate both the distance and the angle of a transmitting coil. In [36]- [38], wireless power transfer systems having multiple-receivers have been reported, but angle sensing capability in the midrange magnetic coupling scheme has not been reported. This article is organized as follows. In Section II, the geometry of a three-coil system is presented and a coupled mode theory is developed to elucidate how the three coils are coupled. In Section III, numerical results of the system performance are presented, revealing that both the angle and the distance of a transmitting coil are uniquely determined in a Fano resonance phenomenon. In addition, the effects of conductor loss of coils and the presence of a ground plane near the receiving coils are investigated, verifying that our system performance is robust due to the use of the ratio of received wave amplitudes. This article is concluded in Section IV."

                "A three-coil system to have one transmitting coil (coil 1) and two receiving coils (coils 2 and 3) is considered, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Coils 1, 2, and 3 have different radii r 1 = 20 cm, r 2 = 5 cm, and r 3 = 8 cm while having the same resonance frequency of 10 MHz, which are obtained by different numbers of wire turns N 1 = 8.42, N 2 = 46, and N 3 = 24.9, respectively, in a common coil length L = 15 cm. The three coils have the same winding direction and a wire radius of 0.5 mm with their axes being parallel to the zx plane. Coils 2 and 3 are placed with a small gap distance of g = 10 cm and thus they are strongly coupled to each other by magnetic fields. Coil 1 is placed at position (R, \u03b8) far away from the pair of coils 2 and 3, and is weakly coupled to each of coils 2 and 3 by magnetic fields, where R is the distance from the coil pair and \u03b8 is the angle from the z axis in the zx plane [\u03b8 and x have the same sign]. The origin of the coordinate system lies at the middle of the gap between coils 2 and 3 with the top end of each coil on the x axis. The axis of coil 1 directs to the origin of the coordinate system. This is a Fano resonance phenomenon that can provide a unique ratio of received wave amplitudes in the receiving coils, enabling position sensing of coil 1. Below we will refer to scattering parameters S ji (coils i to j) or voltages V j (coil j) for evaluating characteristics of the system of Fig. 1."

                        "The system of Fig. 1(a) is numerically investigated by the method of moment simulator, Altair FEKO [41] since Altair FEKO showed good agreement between numerical and experimental results in magnetic resonance coupling between coils around 10 MHz [14]. In the system of Fig. 1(a), a voltage of 1V is applied at the port of coil 1, and voltages are numerically obtained at each port of coils 2 and 3 by Altair FEKO. The lossless case is assumed for the sake of simplicity unless mentioned.  2(a)]. An important observation is that coil 2 has larger wave amplitude than coil 3 (pink line) at 10 MHz, as the coupled mode theory revealed [Eq. ( 5)]. This is seen in the magnetic field distribution [inset of Fig. 1(a)], where coil 2 has stronger magnetic fields comparing with coil 3. The parameters for the coupled mode theory have been retrieved from the numerical results of S 0 21 , S 0 31 and S 0 32 in the two-coil systems [Fig. 2(b)-(d)], and presented in the caption of Fig. 2. The coupled mode theory (symbols) with the retrieved parameters excellently captures the Fano resonance spectra of the three-coil system observed in the numerical results [solid lines in Fig. 2(a)].",
                        "Next the dependency of the ratio |S 21 /S 31 | on the position (R, \u03b8) of coil 1 is investigated. Figure 3  of coil 1 is determined by the ratio of the received wave amplitudes |S 21 /S 31 | and its derivative d d\u03b8 |S 21 /S 31 |, unlike the far-field sensing [35] where the angle of an incident wave was determined without distance information. Practically, for example, the mechanical rotation of the pair of coils 2 and 3 by a few tens of degrees may provide d d\u03b8 |S 21 /S 31 |. The semi-analytical results (symbols) obtained from Eq. ( 4) agree well with the numerical results (curves) obtained by using Altair FEKO. The discrepancy comes from the assumption of the coupled mode theory having the first derivative in time. For example, in the two-coil system of Fig. 2(d), the coupled mode theory shows the frequency split of \u03c9 3 \u00b1\u03ba 32 (symbols), and a good approximation with the numerical result (curve) in this coupling regime. On the other hand, the frequency split in the numerical result is not exactly symmetric, and the asymmetricity is observed for much stronger coupling with narrower gap distance between the coils.",
