    "abstract": "Nitrogen-vacancy (NV - ) centres in diamond offer an excellent platform for device design and development in the emerging fields of quantum sensing and quantum network, but fabrication of quantum-grade diamonds with highly coherent NV- centres needed for advanced applications presents a pressing challenge. Here we report a major advance in generating NV - centres in diamonds via tailored high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) synthesis and post-grown annealing treatment. The resulting well dispersed single NV - centres in type-IIa diamonds exhibit long spin coherence times reaching the highest levels achieved in diamonds prepared by more elaborate and restrictive chemical vapor deposition techniques. Moreover, we produce high-density NV - ensembles in <100>-grown type-Ib diamonds with superb zero-phonon lines considerably sharper than those of native NV - centres in as-grown diamonds. These findings demonstrate a superior synthesis and optimization protocol for creating top-quality NV - centres to meet the most stringent requirements for a wide range of emerging quantum technologies.",

                "We used a cubic large volume press (SPD-6\u00d71200) to synthesize diamond single crystals (~3-9 mm in size) at pressures of 5.3-5.8 GPa and temperatures of 1,350 to 1,650 \u2103 (see details in Experimental Section and Supplementary Fig. S1). High-purity graphite and Fe-Ni alloys were used as carbon source and catalyst, respectively. HPHT synthesized type-Ib diamonds (~0.4 mm in size) were used as seeds for further diamond growth. The morphologies of produced diamonds were controlled by the substrates and P-T parameters; for example, a gradual transformation from a <100>-dominated cubic to a <100>-<111>-equal cub-octahedron, and then to a <111>dominated octahedron can be induced by increasing temperature during the growth process on a <100>-substrate. Al/Ti powders and NaN3/Ba(N3)2 were used as nitrogen getter and nitrogen sources, respectively, to modulate the total nitrogen content in the HPHT synthesis chamber. The obtained high-quality single-crystalline type-IIa diamonds and nitrogen-rich type-Ib diamonds are shown in Fig. 1a-1d. The as-grown diamonds with different nitrogen contents are colorless (below 1 ppm nitrogen), yellowish (~50-150 ppm nitrogen), yellow (~150-600 ppm nitrogen), or green (above 600 ppm nitrogen). Nitrogen impurities are incorporated as substitutional defects in the diamond lattice, as C-centres (P1) with infrared absorption peaks at 1,130 and 1,344 cm -1 , while nitrogen pairs (A-centres) with the characteristic peak at 1,280 cm -1 also appear at increasing N contents (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

Figure 1f shows a photoluminescence (PL) analysis of diamonds produced at 80 K using 473-nm and 532-nm laser excitations. Nitrogen vacancy centres with zero-phonon lines (ZPL) at 575 nm (NV 0 ) and 638 nm (NV -) formed in the <111> growth surface in some type-IIa diamonds and all type-Ib diamonds. The NV -centres in type-IIa diamonds show strong and narrow ZPL, while the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ZPL for the NV -centres in type-Ib diamonds is notably broadened, which is undesirable for quantum applications, thus necessitates improvements via suitable post-grown treatments, as will be discussed below.",
                        "On the <100>-growth surface, H3 centres (N-V-N) with a sharp ZPL at 503 nm appear and generally increase with rising nitrogen content in type-Ib diamonds. NV 0/-centres are seldomly found in the <100>-and <311>-grown diamonds, and sharp lines for different defect locations are identified based on diamond growth orientations (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating preferred formation orientation of NV 0/-centres along the <111> direction during HPHT diamond growth (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S1). In <111>-grown diamonds, the density of NV -centres increases with rising nitrogen content, reaching a maximum value of suitable13.4 ppb in a diamond (sample-IbD06) containing 221 ppm nitrogen impurities, followed by a steep decrease, becoming nearly undetectable at higher nitrogen contents (Fig. 1h). Furthermore, paramagnetic Ni-related defects with ZPL at 494 nm are incorporated into diamond along the <111> direction, which tend to degrade coherent properties of NV -centres; meanwhile, such defects are absent in the <100>-grown bulk (Fig. 1f), making <100>-grown type-Ib diamonds promising substrates for creation of desirable NV -centres via post-grown annealing treatment."

                        "We performed annealing treatment on diamonds synthesized at temperatures ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 \u2103 under pressure of 5 (\u00b1 0.5) GPa, holding for two hours in each run, then quenched the diamonds down to room temperature in 10 minutes. During this process, no graphitisation occurs below 1,700 \u2103 in the nitrogen-rich type-Ib diamonds, while the type-IIa diamonds stayed stable up to 2,000 \u2103. Figure 2a shows an evolution diagram of NV-related defects during the HPHT annealing treatment. The native NV -centres in <111>-grown type-IIa diamonds are stable over the entire temperature range and the PL intensity increases significantly by about five-fold after treatment at 1,500 \u2103 (see Supplementary Fig. S5a). Furthermore, newly generated NV - centres are seen in <100>-grown sections of both type-IIa and type-Ib diamonds without prior any presence of native NV -centres, and these results are sensitive to treatment temperatures (Supplementary Figs. S5b andS6). The creation of NV -centres usually requires high treatment temperatures of 1,900-2,000 \u2103 in type-IIa diamonds, while the nitrogen-rich environment in type-Ib diamonds reduces the treatment temperatures to 1,400 \u2103. Figures 2b,c show PL spectra taken from the <111>-and <100>-grown sections of a type-Ib diamond (sample-IbD06). The ZPL intensity of the NV -centres in the <111>-grown section nearly doubles after the diamond was treated at 1,400 \u2103. At higher annealing temperatures, the ZPL intensity of NV -centres decreases and eventually disappears above 1,600 \u2103, accompanied by a significant increase of signal from H3 centres in the temperature range of 1,400-1,600 \u2103 and the appearance of N4V centres at 1,700 \u2103. In contrast, in the <100>-grown sections, the NV -centres start to form at 1,400 \u2103, reaching a maximum population of ~130 ppb at 1,500 \u2103, and remain stable above 1,700 \u2103 (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, there is a large increase of H3 centres at elevated annealing temperatures, evidenced by a high PL intensity with sharp ZPL at 503 nm at 1,700 \u2103. Figure 2d shows integrated intensity ratio of INV/ID with changing annealing temperature, and excessive nitrogen impurities in primitive crystals reduce the productivity of NV -centres because of aggregation into other complexes, such as H3, N4V, at high temperatures.",

                        "HPHT annealing treatment is also effective in narrowing the width of ZPLs of NV -centres (Fig. 2e). Significantly narrowed ZPLs with FWHM value ~0.31 nm were achieved in the <100>grown diamonds, and this value is only one-seventh of the FWHM of the ZPLs measured in the <111>-grown sections, rivaling those seen in native NV -centres in type-IIa diamonds.",
                        "The high density, strong and narrow ZPL lines, improved thermal stability, and absence of Ni-related defects (Supplementary Figs. S8 andS9) make HPHT synthesized and treated NV - centres in <100>-grown type-Ib diamonds suitable for high-sensitivity sensing devices. Furthermore, temperatures needed to generate NV -centres can be lowered by introducing lattice defects on polished diamond surface (Supplementary Fig. S10). To illustrate this point, we mechanically etched \"HPPMS\" on a <100>-grown diamond surface by FIB techniques and generated NV -centres with a high density of 241.5 ppb in target regions at a depth ~0.5 \u03bcm (Fig. 2f) at significantly reduced annealing temperature down to 1,000 \u2103. This result demonstrates a feasible route for controlled creation of patterned NV -centres at desired target locations under moderate temperature conditions."

It shows that NV -centres dispersedly distribute throughout the diamond after the HPHT annealing process (Supplementary Fig. S11), which can be optically addressed. Figure 3b displays the confocal image of a single NV -center, showing as a bright fluorescence spot (about 0.5 \u03bcm in diameter) with a second-order correlation function of g 2 (0) ~ 0.2 (Fig. 3b insert). Among the 13 measured points, 12 points (92%) are single NV -centres. We then used standard free-induction decay (FID) and spin echo measurements (see Methods) to quantify the spin coherence of these single NV -centres. As shown in Fig. 3c, typical NV electron spin dephasing time (T2*) reaches 3.0 \u03bcs, long enough to resolve the host 14 N and nearby 13 C nuclear spins (the beating feature of Fig. 3c). Spin echo measurements reveal that the spin coherence time, T2, of this NV -centre is about 420 \u03bcs (Fig. 3d). The collapse and revival feature indicates that the 13 C nuclear spin bath (natural abondance) dominates the NV spin decoherence process, and the contribution of P1 center is negligible. We measured 4 single NV -centres in the <111>-grown type-IIa diamonds, and their T2 are all above 300 \u03bcs. This result matches the best value achieved in quantum-grade CVD diamonds. The NV -centres in the type-IIa <100>-diamond (sample-IIaD02) tend to form aggregated states (Supplementary Fig. S12), with only a small number of single NV -centres, due to the high treatment temperature of 2,000 \u2103. The T2 times of single NV -centres in the <100>-grown sections also reach high values ranging from 200 to 300 \u03bcs (Supplementary Fig. S13). Such prolonged coherence times (Fig. 3e) of single NV -centres embedded in HPHT type-IIa diamonds meet the requirement for quantum computing and quantum simulation applications. "

In native NV - ensembles of <111>-grown sections of sample-IbD06, T2 improves to 1.2 \u03bcs by HPHT annealing treatment accompanied by a reduction of NV -density, from 13.4 to 1.8 ppb (Supplementary Fig. S14). In contrast, long T2 (4.3 \u03bcs) and high density (127.2 ppb) of HPHT generated NV - ensembles were simultaneously achieved in the <100>-sections after annealing at 1,500 \u2103 (Fig. 4a). T2 of NV -ensembles (density 123.2 ppb) reaches 12.0 \u03bcs in the annealed <100>-section of sample-IbD05 (Fig. 4b) due to relatively low nitrogen content (25 ppm). With rising annealing treatment temperatures up to 1,700 \u2103, T2 rises to 52.0 \u03bcs, which is the highest reported value for NV -ensembles in type-Ib diamonds, with an increased NV density of 110.2 ppb (Fig. 4c). from the <111>-section of IbD06 (as-grown), <111>-section of IbD06 (annealed at 1,500 \u2103), <311>-section of IbD06 (annealed at 1,500 \u2103), <100>-section of IbD08 (annealed at 1,400 \u2103), <100>-section of IbD06 (annealed at 1,500 \u2103), <100>-section of IbD05 (annealed at 1,500 \u2103), <100>-section of IbD08 (annealed at 1,300 \u2103), and <100>-section of IbD05 (annealed at 1,700 \u2103).

The splitting of resonance is effectively suppressed to the value caused by geomagnetic field in <100>-grown diamonds after annealing, which is essential to zero-field sensing applications 26 . The splitting of resonance (2\u0394) is below 5 MHz and further decreases with increasing annealing temperatures, much improved from that of the native NV -centres in the <111>-grown diamonds (~11-14 MHz). This feature indicates ultralow stress and electric fields near the NV -centres in <100>-grown diamonds. Figure 4g illustrates the correlation between the frequency splitting in zero-field ODMR spectra and measured T2, showing that reduction of frequency splitting is accompanied by long coherence times due to a significant increase of neutral H3 centres (Supplementary Fig. S7) that attenuate the influence of the spin bath from P1 centres (S=1/2) surrounding each NV -center (Fig. 4h) 11,27 , in addition to the decrease of residual stress by HPHT annealing treatment.",

During the initial growth, a properly chosen crystal orientation is pivotal to selectively targeting the qualities of produced NV -centres, and ensuing annealing treatment plays a crucial role in enhancing key performance characteristics via improvement of the spin bath surrounding the NV -centres by increasing neutral H3 centres and dissolving Nirelated defects. Our study led to an unexpected discovery showing that the <100>-grown diamond sections are optimal substrates for generating high-density NV -centres with long coherent times by HPHT annealing treatment, despite that NV -centres rarely appear in <100> sections during the initial diamond growth. This finding establishes a robust protocol for ondemand generation and optimization of highly coherent NV -centres in HPHT diamonds.",

The <100>-grown diamonds containing reduced nitrogen content, e.g., to 1-10 ppm, may exhibit increased density and coherence times for ensemble NV -centres. Moreover, mechanical defects generated by focused ion beam or laser writing in conjunction with HPHT treatment are effective in reducing the annealing temperature required for creating NV -centres at targeted locations using <100>-grown type-Ib diamond as substrate, opening a promising avenue for innovative design and development of NV -centre based devices.",
