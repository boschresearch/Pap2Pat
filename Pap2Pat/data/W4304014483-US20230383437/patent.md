# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The disclosure relates to the field of quantum technology and precision testing materials, and more particularly to the preparation and application of a highly coherent diamond nitrogen vacancy and diamond anvil.

## BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

A nitrogen vacancy (NV−) is an atomic-level defect inside a diamond, including a substituted nitrogen atom and a neighboring nitrogen vacancy, and is very sensitive to external fields (i.e., electric, magnetic, and temperature fields). Extreme conditions such as extremely low temperature, high-pressure and a strong magnetic field are important ways to discover and modulate novel states. To enable sensitive physical property measurements under the extreme conditions, advanced sensing detection schemes need to be developed. Spin quantum sensing based on diamond nitrogen vacancy centers can achieve sensitive measurements of physical parameters such as magnetism, electricity, mechanics, and thermodynamics, and has a spatial resolution at a micro-nano scale and an extremely wide working interval, it is expected to be an important tool for the sensitive physical property measurements under the extreme conditions. In order to realize the external field testing of the nitrogen vacancies under very high-pressure conditions, a commonly used method is to prepare the nitrogen vacancies by ion implantation or electron irradiation on an anvil surface of a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The sensitivity of the nitrogen vacancies depends mainly on their density and coherence time. Generally, the higher the density and the longer the coherence time, the higher the sensitivity. Both the ion implantation and the electron irradiation use high-energy ion or electron beams to bombard the surface of the diamond, causing carbon atoms to be forcibly replaced. The higher implantation energy, the higher implantation concentrations of the nitrogen atoms and the vacancies and the deeper depth. But the higher the implantation energy, the more damage to diamond lattice, even graphitization. In order to avoid the graphitization of the anvil surface, there is an upper limit to the implantation energy. Therefore, the density of the nitrogen vacancies prepared by this method is low and the depth is shallow. During the pressing process of the DAC, the pressure is concentrated on the anvil surface, and when the pressure exceeds about 60 gigapascal (GPa), a probe laser can no longer excite the shallow nitrogen vacancies, so the nitrogen vacancies can no longer be sensed. While, the ion implantation and irradiation bring serious damage to the lattice structure of diamond. It severely reduces mechanical properties of the diamond anvil and reduces the fracture pressure of the DAC.

## SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

In response to a problem that a high-pressure precision detection cannot be used above 60 gigapascal (GPa), the disclosure provides a nondestructive and low-cost formation method for preparing high-quality of nitrogen vacancies. The formation method uses a graphite as a carbon source and a high-pressure-high-temperature (HPHT) diamond as a crystal seed, takes aluminum/titanium (Al/Ti) as a nitrogen remover, synthesizes a single crystal diamond under a high temperature and a high pressure. A volume ratio of a <100> crystal orientation growth region (i.e., growth region of <100> crystal orientation) and a <111> crystal orientation growth region (i.e., growth region of <111> crystal orientation) of the single crystal diamond can be regulated by selections of the crystal seed and a growth temperature. The single crystal diamond is HPHT annealed, and after the annealing, nitrogen vacancies are generated from scratch in the <100> crystal orientation growth region and <311> crystal orientation growth region (i.e., growth region of <311> crystal orientation), while native nitrogen vacancies in the <111> crystal orientation growth region are disappeared, eventually leading to a presence of the nitrogen vacancies in the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions of the single crystal diamond; and the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions do not contain defects related to ferromagnetic elements; thus high-density and highly coherent nitrogen vacancies are produced under the nondestructive conditions, and a diamond anvil with controlled nitrogen vacancy depths are prepared, thereby to achieve a precise detection of the nitrogen vacancies at the pressure above 60 GPa.

A highly coherent diamond nitrogen vacancy formation method uses an iron-nickel catalyst system, and takes a graphite as a carbon source, a HPHT diamond as a crystal seed, and Al/Ti as a nitrogen remover, synthesizes a single crystal diamond with a nitrogen content of 1˜400 parts per million (ppm) under a high temperature and a high pressure, and a volume ratio of a <100> crystal orientation growth region and a <111> crystal orientation growth region of the single crystal diamond can be regulated by selections of the crystal seed and a growth temperature. The synthesized diamond is HPHT annealed under conditions with an annealing pressure of 4.5˜6.5 GPa and an annealing temperature of 1400˜1800 centigrade (° C.); and after annealing, multiple nitrogen vacancies are generated in the <100> crystal orientation growth region from scratch, while native nitrogen vacancies in the <111> crystal orientation growth region are disappeared, eventually leading to a presence of the nitrogen vacancies in the <100> crystal orientation growth region of the diamond. When the single crystal diamond has the <311> crystal orientation growth region, the nitrogen vacancies present in the <311> crystal orientation growth region of diamond at the same time; meanwhile, the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions do not contain defects related to the ferromagnetic elements.

In an embodiment, the graphite is a graphite with a purity equal to or greater than 99.9%; the high pressure for synthesizing the single crystal diamond with nitrogen content of 1˜400 ppm is in a range of 5.0 GPa to 6.5 GPa, and the high temperature is in a range of 1350° C. to 1850° C., and a time for keeping the temperature is in a range of 10 h to 60 h.

A method for preparing the highly coherent diamond anvil, using the highly coherent diamond nitrogen vacancy, includes three steps.


- - (1) Using an iron-nickel catalyst system, taking a high-purity
    graphite as a carbon source, and taking Al/Ti as a nitrogen remover,
    synthesizing a single crystal diamond with a nitrogen content in a
    range of 1 ppm to 400 ppm by keeping a temperature of 1350˜1850° C.
    for 10˜60 h at a pressure of 5.0˜6.5 GPa; and a volume ratio of a
    \<100\> crystal orientation growth region and a \<111\> crystal
    orientation growth region of the single crystal diamond is regulated
    by selections of a crystal seed and a growth temperature.
  - (2) Performing annealing at an annealing pressure in a range of 4.5
    GPa to 6.5 GPa, an annealing temperature in a range of 1400° C. to
    1800° C., and an annealing time in a range of 1 h to 20 h; after the
    annealing, multiple nitrogen vacancies are generated from scratch in
    the \<100\> crystal orientation growth region, while native nitrogen
    vacancies in the \<111\> crystal orientation growth region are
    disappeared, eventually leading to the presence of the nitrogen
    vacancies in the \<100\> crystal orientation growth region of the
    diamond; when the single crystal diamond has the \<311\> crystal
    orientation growth region, the nitrogen vacancies present in the
    \<311\> crystal orientation growth region of diamond at the same
    time; and the \<100\> and \<311\> crystal orientation growth regions
    do not contain defects related to the ferromagnetic elements.
  - (3) Performing cutting on the single crystal diamond by placing an
    anvil surface inside one of the \<100\> and \<311\> crystal
    orientation growth regions, and placing a main body of the diamond
    anvil in the \<111\> crystal orientation growth region according to
    nitrogen vacancy depth requirements.

In an embodiment, orders of the annealing and the cutting of the diamond anvil can be exchanged.

In an embodiment, in the highly coherent diamond anvil prepared by the above method for preparing the highly coherent diamond anvil, a ratio of a depth of the nitrogen vacancies to a height of the diamond anvil is greater than 0 and less than 1.

Application of the highly coherent diamond anvil prepared by the above method for preparing the highly coherent diamond anvil in high voltage quantum sensors.

After the annealing at the range of 1400° C. to 1800° C., the multiple nitrogen vacancies are generated in the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions from scratch, while the native nitrogen vacancies in the <111> crystal orientation growth region are disappeared, eventually leading to the presence of the nitrogen vacancies in the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions of the diamond; and the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions do not contain defects associated with ferromagnetic elements such as iron, nickel, etc. The peak width at half-height (FWHM) of fluorescence spectra of the nitrogen vacancies in the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions of the annealed diamond is comparable to the FWHM of a low-nitrogen type IIa diamond; a grown diamond contains the <100> crystal orientation growth region through the selection of crystal species of the <100> crystal orientation growth region or the <111> crystal orientation growth region and the control of the growth temperature; and the cutting on the single crystal diamond can be any of available ways.

The disclosure has five beneficial effects as following.


- - (1) In the related art, the thickness of the nitrogen vacancies is
    usually around several tens of nm, and the thickness of the nitrogen
    vacancies is not controllable. However, the thickness of the
    nitrogen vacancies in the diamond anvil of the disclosure is
    controllable and the thickness of the nitrogen vacancies of the
    disclosure can be cut according to usage requirements.
  - (2) Mechanical properties of the diamond anvil are high. The
    disclosure is a nondestructive preparation of the nitrogen
    vacancies, and the anvil surface will not be damaged, so the
    intrinsic mechanical properties of diamond are maintained.
  - (3) The nitrogen vacancies in the diamond anvil have high
    sensitivity. The smaller energy for implantation is usually used in
    the related art in order to avoid serious damages to the anvil
    surface, resulting in a low density of the generated nitrogen
    vacancies and a short coherent time, and the nitrogen vacancies have
    low sensitivity. The density of the nitrogen vacancies prepared by
    the disclosure is high and the coherence time is long, so the
    sensitivity of the nitrogen vacancies is significantly higher than
    the sensitivity of the related art.
  - (4) Preparation costs are low. The related art requires a use of an
    advanced research equipment such as a transmission electron
    microscope (TEM) and a focused ion beam (FIB), but the disclosure
    uses a mature diamond growth equipment, so the preparation costs are
    greatly reduced.
  - (5) There are no nickel-related defects in regions where the
    nitrogen vacancies present.
