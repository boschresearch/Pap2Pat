                        "A nitrogen vacancy (NV\u2212) is an atomic-level defect inside a diamond, including a substituted nitrogen atom and a neighboring nitrogen vacancy, and is very sensitive to external fields (i.e., electric, magnetic, and temperature fields). Extreme conditions such as extremely low temperature, high-pressure and a strong magnetic field are important ways to discover and modulate novel states. To enable sensitive physical property measurements under the extreme conditions, advanced sensing detection schemes need to be developed. Spin quantum sensing based on diamond nitrogen vacancy centers can achieve sensitive measurements of physical parameters such as magnetism, electricity, mechanics, and thermodynamics, and has a spatial resolution at a micro-nano scale and an extremely wide working interval, it is expected to be an important tool for the sensitive physical property measurements under the extreme conditions. In order to realize the external field testing of the nitrogen vacancies under very high-pressure conditions, a commonly used method is to prepare the nitrogen vacancies by ion implantation or electron irradiation on an anvil surface of a diamond anvil cell (DAC). The sensitivity of the nitrogen vacancies depends mainly on their density and coherence time. Generally, the higher the density and the longer the coherence time, the higher the sensitivity. Both the ion implantation and the electron irradiation use high-energy ion or electron beams to bombard the surface of the diamond, causing carbon atoms to be forcibly replaced. The higher implantation energy, the higher implantation concentrations of the nitrogen atoms and the vacancies and the deeper depth. But the higher the implantation energy, the more damage to diamond lattice, even graphitization. In order to avoid the graphitization of the anvil surface, there is an upper limit to the implantation energy. Therefore, the density of the nitrogen vacancies prepared by this method is low and the depth is shallow. During the pressing process of the DAC, the pressure is concentrated on the anvil surface, and when the pressure exceeds about 60 gigapascal (GPa), a probe laser can no longer excite the shallow nitrogen vacancies, so the nitrogen vacancies can no longer be sensed. While, the ion implantation and irradiation bring serious damage to the lattice structure of diamond. It severely reduces mechanical properties of the diamond anvil and reduces the fracture pressure of the DAC."

                        "In response to a problem that a high-pressure precision detection cannot be used above 60 gigapascal (GPa), the disclosure provides a nondestructive and low-cost formation method for preparing high-quality of nitrogen vacancies. The formation method uses a graphite as a carbon source and a high-pressure-high-temperature (HPHT) diamond as a crystal seed, takes aluminum/titanium (Al/Ti) as a nitrogen remover, synthesizes a single crystal diamond under a high temperature and a high pressure. A volume ratio of a <100> crystal orientation growth region (i.e., growth region of <100> crystal orientation) and a <111> crystal orientation growth region (i.e., growth region of <111> crystal orientation) of the single crystal diamond can be regulated by selections of the crystal seed and a growth temperature. The single crystal diamond is HPHT annealed, and after the annealing, nitrogen vacancies are generated from scratch in the <100> crystal orientation growth region and <311> crystal orientation growth region (i.e., growth region of <311> crystal orientation), while native nitrogen vacancies in the <111> crystal orientation growth region are disappeared, eventually leading to a presence of the nitrogen vacancies in the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions of the single crystal diamond; and the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions do not contain defects related to ferromagnetic elements; thus high-density and highly coherent nitrogen vacancies are produced under the nondestructive conditions, and a diamond anvil with controlled nitrogen vacancy depths are prepared, thereby to achieve a precise detection of the nitrogen vacancies at the pressure above 60 GPa.",
                        "A highly coherent diamond nitrogen vacancy formation method uses an iron-nickel catalyst system, and takes a graphite as a carbon source, a HPHT diamond as a crystal seed, and Al/Ti as a nitrogen remover, synthesizes a single crystal diamond with a nitrogen content of 1\u02dc400 parts per million (ppm) under a high temperature and a high pressure, and a volume ratio of a <100> crystal orientation growth region and a <111> crystal orientation growth region of the single crystal diamond can be regulated by selections of the crystal seed and a growth temperature. The synthesized diamond is HPHT annealed under conditions with an annealing pressure of 4.5\u02dc6.5 GPa and an annealing temperature of 1400\u02dc1800 centigrade (\u00b0 C.); and after annealing, multiple nitrogen vacancies are generated in the <100> crystal orientation growth region from scratch, while native nitrogen vacancies in the <111> crystal orientation growth region are disappeared, eventually leading to a presence of the nitrogen vacancies in the <100> crystal orientation growth region of the diamond. When the single crystal diamond has the <311> crystal orientation growth region, the nitrogen vacancies present in the <311> crystal orientation growth region of diamond at the same time; meanwhile, the <100> and <311> crystal orientation growth regions do not contain defects related to the ferromagnetic elements.",

However, the thickness of the\n    nitrogen vacancies in the diamond anvil of the disclosure is\n    controllable and the thickness of the nitrogen vacancies of the\n    disclosure can be cut according to usage requirements.\n  - (2) Mechanical properties of the diamond anvil are high. The\n    disclosure is a nondestructive preparation of the nitrogen\n    vacancies, and the anvil surface will not be damaged, so the\n    intrinsic mechanical properties of diamond are maintained.\n  - (3) The nitrogen vacancies in the diamond anvil have high\n    sensitivity. The smaller energy for implantation is usually used in\n    the related art in order to avoid serious damages to the anvil\n    surface, resulting in a low density of the generated nitrogen\n    vacancies and a short coherent time, and the nitrogen vacancies have\n    low sensitivity. The density of the nitrogen vacancies prepared by\n    the disclosure is high and the coherence time is long, so the\n    sensitivity of the nitrogen vacancies is significantly higher than\n    the sensitivity of the related art.\n  - (4) Preparation costs are low. The related art requires a use of an\n    advanced research equipment such as a transmission electron\n    microscope (TEM) and a focused ion beam (FIB), but the disclosure\n    uses a mature diamond growth equipment, so the preparation costs are\n    greatly reduced.\n  - (5) There are no nickel-related defects in regions where the\n    nitrogen vacancies present."
