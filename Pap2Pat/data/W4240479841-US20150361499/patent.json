                        "Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recent studies report an increased frequency of GI symptoms in ASD children compared with typically developing children and those with other developmental delays (Valicenti-McDermott et al. (2006) J Dev Behav Pediatr 27(2 Suppl): S128-136; Ming et al. (2008) J Child Neurol 23: 6-13; Buie et al. (2010) Pediatrics 125 Suppl 1: S1-18; Bauman (2010) Neurotherapeutics 7(3): 320-327). Prospective, controlled studies suggest that as many as 70% of autistic children exhibit chronic GI-related symptoms (Valicenti-McDermott et al. (2006) J Dev Behav Pediatr 27(2 Suppl): S128-136; Horvath and Perman (2002) Current Opinion in Ped 14: 583-587; Levy (2007) Biol Psychiatry 61: 492-497) including diarrhea, laxative-dependent constipation, abdominal distension, failure to thrive, weight loss, feeding problems, and abdominal pain related to extreme irritability, aggression, and self-injury. These symptoms can be minimized or disappear following treatment of the underlying GI disorder (Jarocka-Cyrta et al. (2011) J Autism Dev Disord 41(3): 372-374). Retrospective chart review studies have shown no increase in GI symptoms in ASD children compared to neurotypical children (Black et al. (2002) BMJ 325(24): 419-421).",
                        "Gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often associated with mucosal inflammatory infiltrates of the small and large intestine. Although distinct histologic and immunohistochemical properties of this inflammatory infiltrate have been previously described in this ASDIC group, molecular characterization of these lesions has not been reported. In ASD children with GI symptoms who undergo endoscopic and histologic examinations, inflammatory pathology is reported with high frequency (Horvath et al. (1999) J Pediatr 135: 559-563; Ashwood et al. (2004) J Clin Immunol 24: 664-673; Gonzalez et al. (2005) Arch Venez Pueric Pediat 69: 19-25; Krigsman et al. (2010) Autism Insights 1: 1-11). Features of the GI disease reported originally\u2014ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and ileocolitis\u2014have since been expanded to include esophagitis (Horvath et al. (1999) J Pediatr 135: 559-563), atypical focal gastritis (Torrente et al. (2004) Am J Gastroenterol 4: 598-605), and enteritis (Torrente et al. (2004) Am J Gastroenterol 4: 598-60514; Torrente et al. (2002) Mol Psychiatry 7: 375-382; Balzola et al. (2005) Am J Gastroenterol 100: 979-981). Further analyses of the inflammatory infiltrate in the mucosa and the associated mucosal cytokine profiles have not only confirmed the presence of disease, but suggest characteristic features that distinguish the lesions in ASD children from the more well-described inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), i.e. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Ashwood et al. (2004) J Clin Immunol 24: 664-673; Torrente et al. (2004) Am J Gastroenterol 4: 598-605; Torrente et al. (2002) Mol Psychiatry 7: 375-382; Furlano et al. (2001) J Pediatr 38: 366-372). In parallel, disturbances in mucosal function (D'Eufemia et al. (1996) Acta Paediatr 85: 1076-1079; De Magistris et al. (2010) J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 51: 418-424) and intestinal microflora (Finegold et al. (2002) Clin Infect Dis 35(Suppl 1): S6-S16; Williams et al. (2011) PLoS One 6(9): e24585) have been reported and may contribute to the GI pathology in ASD. A recent consensus report regarding GI disorders in individuals with ASDs concluded that ASD children with classic gastrointestinal symptoms often have a chronic inflammatory process \u201ccharacterized by nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH), enterocolitis, and mucosal infiltration by immune cells along the length of the gastrointestinal tract\u201d (Buie et al. (2010) Pediatrics 125 Suppl 1: S1-18). While the clinical significance of these findings is still under investigation, it appears that the immunologic and inflammatory activity in the bowel may be part of a larger, systemic multi-organ immunopathology (Jyonouchi et al. (2001) J Neuroimmunol 120(1-2): 170-179; Jyonouchi et al. (2005) Neuropsychobiology 51(2): 77-85; Vargas et al. (2005) Ann Neurol 57(1): 67-81. Erratum in: Ann Neurol. 2005; 57(2): 304).",
                        "Currently, it is not clear whether the mucosal inflammatory changes seen in ASDIC children represent a milder variant of inflammatory bowel disease or whether a novel pathogenic process is underway. It is possible that a thorough molecular characterization of inflamed gastrointestinal tissue from ASD children and children with established IBD will help to answer this question. Several studies have described the use of gene expression profiling of biopsy-derived gastrointestinal tissue to provide molecular signatures for, and to distinguish between, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (e.g., Wu et al. (2007) Inflamm Bowel Dis 13(7): 807-821; Galamb et al. (2006) World J Gastroenterol 12(43): 6998-7006; Costello et al. (2005) PLoS Med 2(8): e199; Lawrance et al. (2001) Hum Mol Genet 10(5): 445-456). Using this approach, one group identified a biomarker panel that could be used to distinguish IBD (Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)) from \u201cnon-IBD\u201d (in this case irritable bowel syndrome; IBS). The study further identified a subset of transcripts, consisting of seven genes, whose differential expression was useful in distinguishing the IBD subtypes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity (von Stein et al. (2008) Gastroenterology 134(7): 1869-1881). Gene expression analysis has been recently utilized in the investigation of gastrointestinal dysfunction in ASD children. Building upon prior findings of mucosal brush border enzyme deficiencies in GI symptomatic ASD children, transcript levels of ileal disaccharidases were measured and found to be deficient in those patients (Williams et al. (2011) PLoS One 6(9): e24585. Epub 2011 Sep. 16). Using pyrosequencing analysis of mucoepithelial bacteria, a significant multi-component dysbiosis in the same ASD cohort was also reported.",
                        "Despite the published evidence (Horvath et al. (1999) J Pediatr 135: 559-563: Ashwood et al. (2004) J Clin Immunol 24: 664-673: Gonzalez et al. (2005) Arch Venez Pueric Pediat 69: 19-25: Krigsman et al. (2010) Autism Insights 1: 1-11: Torrente et al. (2004) Am J Gastroenterol 4: 598-605: Torrente et al. (2002) Mol Psychiatry 7: 375-382: Furlano et al. (2001) J Pediatr 38: 366-372), the debate still continues (Buie et al. (2010) Pediatrics 125 Suppl 1: S1-18; Galiatsatos et al. (2009) Can J Gastroenterol 23: 95-98: Wright (2010) BMJ 340: c1807) as to whether children with ASD and GI symptoms and non-specific mucosal infiltrates have conventionally recognized forms of IBD, a novel IBD phenotype, or no disease at all.",
                        "Detailed molecular information, generated from clinical specimens derived from ASDIC children, has the potential to provide valuable clarification of some of these issues. At a minimum, the analysis of differential gene expression in relevant tissue from this group of affected children will lead to a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in their inflammatory disease, including pathways that have been significantly impacted. This in turn may provide a more detailed understanding of the biology that underlies this condition.",
                        "Therefore, there is a need in the art for a molecular characterization of children with ASD and GI symptoms and for methods of diagnosing ASD, and GI disorders in children with ASD. The present invention satisfies this unmet need."

The invention is partly based on the comparison of gene expression profiles (differentially expressed transcripts) in both ileal and colonic tissues in GI symptomatic ASD children (ASDIC) and non-ASD control groups (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and normal).",

Given the probability of multiple underlying pathogenic mechanisms of some ASD-associated inflammatory disorders, the present invention provides novel biomarkers present in the biological sample of a subject. The biomarkers of the invention allow a more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment strategy of an ASD-associated inflammatory disorder.",

In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sample is obtained from cells of the gastrointestinal tract of a patient.",

In certain embodiments of the invention, the method is performed on a plurality of individuals and the results are then categorized based upon similarities or differences in their gene expression profiles. Optionally, the expression profile(s) is observed and/or collected and/or stored using a computer system comprising a processor element and a memory storage element adapted to process and store data from one or more expression profiles (e.g. in a library of such profiles). In this context, certain embodiments of the invention comprise an electronically searchable library of profiles, wherein the profiles include an individual's gene expression data in combination with other diagnostic data, for example assessments of behavior associated with autism spectrum disorders.",

In one embodiment, the biomarker of the invention is one listed in Table 6. In another embodiment, the biomarker of the invention is one listed in Table 9. In one embodiment, the biomarker of the invention is detected to have decreased expression in a subject with ASD compared to a control sample. In another embodiment, the biomarker of the invention is detected to have increased expression in a subject with ASD compared to a control sample.",

As described herein, altered gene expression of transcripts indicated the presence of a gastrointestinal disorder in ASD individuals. The molecular evidence indicated an overlapping, yet unique, IBD-like condition in ASD children.",

Biological samples also include bodily fluids, including, but not limited to, blood, blood serum, plasma, saliva, and urine. Elevated levels of a biomarker alone or in combination with one or more additional markers are considered a positive indicator of a gastrointestinal and/or austism spectrum disorder. In general, an increase in polypeptide or polynucleotide levels is indicative",
                                "Any suitable method can be used to detect one or more of the markers described herein. Successful practice of the invention can be achieved with one or a combination of methods that can detect and, preferably, quantify the markers. These methods include, without limitation, hybridization-based methods, including those employed in biochip arrays, mass spectrometry (e.g., laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry), fluorescence (e.g. sandwich immunoassay), surface plasmon resonance, ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. Expression levels of markers (e.g., polynucleotides or polypeptides) are compared by procedures well known in the art, such as RT-PCR, Northern blotting, Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, binding to magnetic and/or antibody-coated beads, in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), flow chamber adhesion assay, ELISA, microarray analysis, or colorimetric assays. Methods may further include, one or more of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ESI-MS/MS, ESI-MS/(MS)n, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS), desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS), APCI-MS/MS, APCI-(MS)\u201d, atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry (APPI-MS), APPI-MS/MS, and APPI-(MS)n, quadrupole mass spectrometry, fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS), and ion trap mass spectrometry, where n is an integer greater than zero. Detection methods may include use of a biochip array. Biochip arrays useful in the invention include protein and polynucleotide arrays. One or more markers are captured on the biochip array and subjected to analysis to detect the level of the markers in a sample.",
                                "Markers may be captured with capture reagents immobilized to a solid support, such as a biochip, a multiwell microtiter plate, a resin, or a nitrocellulose membrane that is subsequently probed for the presence or level of a marker. Capture can be on a chromatographic surface or a biospecific surface. For example, a sample containing the markers, such as serum, may be used to contact the active surface of a biochip for a sufficient time to allow binding. Unbound molecules are washed from the surface using a suitable eluant, such as phosphate buffered saline. In general, the more stringent the eluant, the more tightly the proteins must be bound to be retained after the wash.",
                                "Upon capture on a biochip, analytes can be detected by a variety of detection methods selected from, for example, a gas phase ion spectrometry method, an optical method, an electrochemical method, atomic force microscopy and a radio frequency method. In one embodiment, mass spectrometry, and in particular, SELDI, is used. Optical methods include, for example, detection of fluorescence, luminescence, chemiluminescence, absorbance, reflectance, transmittance, birefringence or refractive index (e.g., surface plasmon resonance, ellipsometry, a resonant mirror method, a grating coupler waveguide method or interferometry). Optical methods include microscopy (both confocal and non-confocal), imaging methods and nonimaging methods. Immunoassays in various formats (e.g., ELISA) are popular methods for detection of analytes captured on a solid phase. Electrochemical methods include voltametry and amperometry methods. Radio frequency methods include multipolar resonance spectroscopy.",
                                "Mass spectrometry (MS) is a well-known tool for analyzing chemical compounds. Thus, in one embodiment, the methods of the present invention comprise performing quantitative MS to measure the serum peptide marker. The method may be performed in an automated (Villanueva, et al., Nature Protocols (2006) 1(2):880-891) or semi-automated format. This can be accomplished, for example with MS operably linked to a liquid chromatography device (LC-MS/MS or LC-MS) or gas chromatography device (GC-MS or GC-MS/MS). Methods for performing MS are known in the field and have been disclosed, for example, in US Patent Application Publication Nos: 20050023454; 20050035286; U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,979 and references disclosed therein.",
                                "In an additional embodiment of the methods of the present invention, multiple markers are measured. The use of multiple markers increases the predictive value of the test and provides greater utility in diagnosis, patient stratification and patient monitoring. The process called \u201cPattern recognition\u201d detects the patterns formed by multiple markers greatly improves the sensitivity and specificity of clinical markers for predictive medicine. Subtle variations in data from clinical samples indicate that certain patterns of protein expression can predict phenotypes such as the presence or absence of a certain disease, a particular stage of disease-progression, or a positive or adverse response to drug treatments. In the present invention, additional markers may include cytokine profiles and/or serum antibodies directed against gut microbes.",
                                "Expression levels of particular nucleic acids or polypeptides are correlated with a gastrointestinal disorder and/or autistic spectrum disorder and thus are useful in diagnosis. Methods for measuring levels of polypeptide include immunoassay, ELISA, western blotting and radioimmunoassay. Oligonucleotides or longer fragments derived from a nucleic acid sequence described herein, antibodies that bind a polypeptide described herein, or any other method known in the art may be used to monitor expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide of interest. In other embodiments, a 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6-fold change in the level of a marker of the invention is indicative of a gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder. In yet another embodiment, an expression profile that characterizes alterations in the expression two or more markers is correlated with a particular disease state (e.g., gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder).",
                                "The diagnostic methods described herein can be used individually or in combination with any other diagnostic method described herein for a more accurate diagnosis of the presence of a gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder. The diagnostic methods described herein can also be used to reliably distinguish ileoclitis in an individual having autism spectrum disorder from Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease.",
                                "As indicated above, the invention provides methods for aiding diagnosis of a gastrointestinal and/or autism spectrum disorder using one or more markers, as specified herein. These markers can be used alone, in combination with other markers in any set, or with entirely different markers in aiding diagnosis. The measurement of markers may also involve quantifying the markers to correlate the detection of markers with a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal and/or autism spectrum disorder. Thus, if the amount of the markers detected in a subject being tested is different compared to a control amount (i.e., higher than the control), then the subject being tested has a higher probability of having a gastrointestinal and/or autism spectrum disorder. The correlation may take into account the amount of the marker or markers in the sample compared to a control amount of the marker or markers (e.g., in normal subjects). A control can be, e.g., the average or median amount of marker present in comparable samples of normal subjects in normal subjects or in subjects such as where the disease or disorder is undetectable. The control amount is measured under the same or substantially similar experimental conditions as in measuring the test amount. As a result, the control can be employed as a reference standard, where the normal (non-disease) phenotype is known, and each result can be compared to that standard, rather than re-running a control.",
                                "Accordingly, a marker profile may be obtained from a subject sample and compared to a reference marker profile obtained from a reference population, so that it is possible to classify the subject as belonging to or not belonging to the reference population. The correlation may take into account the presence or absence of the markers in a test sample and the frequency of detection of the same markers in a control. The correlation may take into account both of such factors to facilitate diagnosis of a gastrointestinal and/or autism spectrum disorder.",
                                "In certain embodiments of the methods of qualifying a disorder, the methods further comprise managing subject treatment based on the status. The invention also provides for such methods where the markers (or specific combination of markers) are measured again after subject management. In these cases, the methods are used to monitor the status of the disorder or progression of the disorder.",
                                "Any marker, individually, is useful in aiding in the diagnosis of a gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder. First, the selected marker is detected in a subject sample using the methods described herein. Then, the result is compared with a control that distinguishes disorder status from non-disorder status. As is well understood in the art, the techniques can be adjusted to increase sensitivity or specificity of the diagnostic assay depending on the preference of the diagnostician.",
                                "The diagnosis of a gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder can be used to inform treatment selection. Treatments for such ASD or ASD inflammatory disorders include without limitation treatment with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations, cytokine specific antagonists, dietary restrictions, antimicrobials, probiotics, and supplemental digestive enzymes. Additionally, treatment for such ASD or ASD inflammatory disorders may include targeted therapies that decrease or eliminate the expression of any of the nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides of the genes responsible for the unique transcriptomes described herein.",
                                "While individual markers are useful diagnostic markers, in some instances, a combination of markers provides greater predictive value than single markers alone. The detection of a plurality of markers (or absence thereof, as the case may be) in a sample can increase the percentage of true positive and true negative diagnoses and decrease the percentage of false positive or false negative diagnoses. Thus, preferred methods of the present invention comprise the measurement of more than one marker.",

                                "As reported herein, a number of biomarkers have been identified that are associated with a gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder. In particular, the invention provides diagnostic methods and compositions useful for identifying an expression profile that identifies a subject as having a gastrointestinal and/or autistic spectrum disorder. Such assays can be used to measure an alteration in the level of a gene transcript or polypeptide encoded by the transcript.",
                                "The polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the invention are useful as hybridizable array elements in a microarray. The array elements are organized in an ordered fashion such that each element is present at a specified location on the substrate. Useful substrate materials include membranes, composed of paper, nylon or other materials, filters, chips, glass slides, and other solid supports. The ordered arrangement of the array elements allows hybridization patterns and intensities to be interpreted as expression levels of particular genes or proteins.

The biological samples are generally derived from a patient, preferably as a bodily fluid (such as blood, blood serum, plasma, saliva, urine, seminal fluids, and ejaculate) or tissue sample (e.g. a tissue sample obtained by biopsy). For some applications, cultured cells or other tissue preparations may be used. The mRNA is isolated according to standard methods, and cDNA is produced and used as a template to make complementary RNA suitable for hybridization. Such methods are known in the art. The RNA is amplified in the presence of fluorescent nucleotides, and the labeled probes are then incubated with the microarray to allow the probe sequence to hybridize to complementary oligonucleotides bound to the microarray.",
                                "Incubation conditions are adjusted such that hybridization occurs with precise complementary matches or with various degrees of less complementarity depending on the degree of stringency employed. For example, stringent salt concentration will ordinarily be less than about 750 mM NaCl and 75 mM trisodium citrate, preferably less than about 500 mM NaCl and 50 mM trisodium citrate, and most preferably less than about 250 mM NaCl and 25 mM trisodium citrate. Low stringency hybridization can be obtained in the absence of organic solvent, e.g., formamide, while high stringency hybridization can be obtained in the presence of at least about 35% formamide, and most preferably at least about 50% formamide. Stringent temperature conditions will ordinarily include temperatures of at least about 30\u00b0 C., more preferably of at least about 37 C, and most preferably of at least about 42\u00b0 C.",

Various levels of stringency are accomplished by combining these various conditions as needed. In a preferred embodiment, hybridization will occur at 30\u00b0 C. in 750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate, and 1% SDS. In a more preferred embodiment, hybridization will occur at 37\u00b0 C. in 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM trisodium citrate, 1% SDS, 35% formamide, and 100 \u03bcg/\u03bcl denatured salmon sperm DNA (ssDNA).

                                "The removal of nonhybridized probes may be accomplished, for example, by washing. The washing steps that follow hybridization can also vary in stringency. Wash stringency conditions can be defined by salt concentration and by temperature. As above, wash stringency can be increased by decreasing salt concentration or by increasing temperature. For example, stringent salt concentration for the wash steps will preferably be less than about 30 mM NaCl and 3 mM trisodium citrate, and most preferably less than about 15 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM trisodium citrate. Stringent temperature conditions for the wash steps will ordinarily include a temperature of at least about 25\u00b0 C., more preferably of at least about 42\u00b0 C., and most preferably of at least about 68\u00b0 C.

Quant. Biol., 51:263-273 (1986); and C. R. Newton & A. Graham, Introduction to Biotechniques: PCR, 2nd Ed., Springer-Verlag (New York: 1997), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe processes to amplify a nucleic acid sample target using PCR amplification extension primers which hybridize with the sample target. As the PCR amplification primers are extended, using a DNA polymerase (preferably thermostable), more sample target is made so that more primers can be used to repeat the process, thus amplifying the sample target sequence. Typically, the reaction conditions are cycled between those conducive to hybridization and nucleic acid polymerization, and those that result in the denaturation of duplex molecules.",
                                "In the first step of the reaction, the nucleic acid molecules of the sample are transiently heated, and then cooled, in order to denature double stranded molecules. Forward and reverse primers are present in the amplification reaction mixture at an excess concentration relative to the sample target. When the sample is incubated under conditions conducive to hybridization and polymerization, the primers hybridize to the complementary strand of the nucleic acid molecule at a position 3\u2032 to the sequence of the region desired to be amplified that is the complement of the sequence whose amplification is desired. Upon hybridization, the 3\u2032 ends of the primers are extended by the polymerase. The extension of the primer results in the synthesis of a DNA molecule having the exact sequence of the complement of the desired nucleic acid sample target. The PCR reaction is capable of exponentially amplifying the desired nucleic acid sequences, with a near doubling of the number of molecules having the desired sequence in each cycle. Thus, by permitting cycles of hybridization, polymerization, and denaturation, an exponential increase in the concentration of the desired nucleic acid molecule can be achieved.",

Polymerase enzymes having high fidelity 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity are useful, for example, when primer extension must be performed with high specificity. Polymerase enzymes having 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity are known to those in the art. Examples of suitable proofreading enzymes include TaKaRa LA Taq (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) and Pfu (Stratagene), Vent, Deep Vent (New England Biolabs).

When using a combination of polymerases in long range PCR, it is preferable to include one polymerase having 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity, which assures high fidelity generation of the PCR product from the DNA template. Typically, a non-proofreading polymerase, which is the main polymerase is also used in conjunction with the proofreading polymerase in long range PCR reactions.

One DNA sequencing method is the Sanger method, which is also referred to as dideoxy sequencing or chain termination. The Sanger method is based on the use of dideoxynucleotides (ddNTP's) in addition to the normal nucleotides (NTP's) found in DNA. Dideoxynucleotides are essentially the same as nucleotides except they contain a hydrogen group on the 3\u2032 carbon instead of a hydroxyl group (OH). These modified nucleotides, when integrated into a sequence, prevent the addition of further nucleotides. This occurs because a phosphodiester bond cannot form between the dideoxynucleotide and the next incoming nucleotide, and thus the DNA chain is terminated. Using this method, optionally coupled with amplification of the nucleic acid target, one can now rapidly sequence large numbers of target molecules, usually employing automated sequencing apparati. Such techniques are well known to those of skill in the art.",

No. 2006008824; herein incorporated by reference). Pyrosequencing, which is also referred to as sequencing by synthesis, involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced, synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically one base pair at a time, and detecting by chemiluminescence the base that is added. In one embodiment, the template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are sequentially added and removed from the reaction. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template. The templates for pyrosequencing can be made both by solid phase template preparation (streptavidin-coated magnetic beads) and enzymatic template preparation (apyrase+exonuclease).",

The addition of one of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs)(in place of dATP, dATPaS is added, which is not a substrate for a luciferase) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template, and the incorporation of the nucleotide releases pyrophosphate (PPi) stoichiometrically. ATP sulfurylase quantitatively converts PPi to ATP in the presence of adenosine 5\u2032 phospho sulfate. The ATP generated acts to catalyze the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin and generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATP. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program. Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the apyrase, and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide.",

Various real-time PCR testing platforms that may be used with the present invention include: 5\u2032 nuclease (TaqMan\u00ae probes), molecular beacons, and FRET hybridization probes. These detection methods rely on the transfer of light energy between two adjacent dye molecules, a process referred to as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (see, e.g., Espy et al (2006) Clin Microbiol Rev. 2006 January; 19(1): 165-256 for a review of various rtPCR approaches that may be used with the present invention).",

A TaqMan\u00ae probe is a short oligonucleotide (DNA) that contains a 5\u2032 fluorescent dye and 3\u2032 quenching dye. To generate a light signal (i.e., remove the effects of the quenching dye on the fluorescent dye), two events must occur. First, the probe must bind to a complementary strand of DNA, e.g., at about 60\u00b0 C. Second, at this temperature, Taq polymerase, which is commonly used for PCR, must cleave the 5\u2032 end of the TaqMan\u00ae probe (5\u2032 nuclease activity), separating the fluorescent dye from the quenching dye.",

Thus, these probes can be used to detect a specific, predefined polymorphism under the probe in the PCR amplification product. Two reaction vessels are typically used, one with a complementary probe to detect wild-type target DNA and another for detection of a specific nucleic acid sequence of a mutant strain. Because TaqMan\u00ae probes typically require temperatures of about 60\u00b0 C. for efficient 5\u2032 nuclease activity, the PCR may be cycled between about 90-95\u00b0 C. and about 60\u00b0 C. for amplification. In addition, the cleaved (free) fluorescent dye can accumulate after each PCR temperature cycle; thus, the dye can be measured at any time during the PCR cycling, including the hybridization step. In contrast, molecular beacons and FRET hybridization probes typically involve the measurement of fluorescence during the hybridization step.",

                                "Molecular beacons are another real-time PCR approach which may be used to identify the presence or absence of a polymorphism of the present invention. Molecular beacons are oligonucleotide probes that are labeled with a fluorescent dye (typically on the 5\u2032 end) and a quencher dye (typically on the 3\u2032 end). A region at each end of the molecular beacon probe is designed to be complementary to itself, so at low temperatures the ends anneal, creating a hairpin structure. This hairpin structure positions the two dyes in close proximity, quenching the fluorescence from the reporter dye. The central region of the probe is designed to be complementary to a region of a PCR amplification product. At higher temperatures, both the PCR amplification product and probe are single stranded. As the temperature of the PCR is lowered, the central region of the molecular beacon probe may bind to the PCR product and force the separation of the fluorescent reporter dye from the quenching dye. Without the quencher dye in close proximity, a light signal from the reporter dye can be detected. If no PCR amplification product is available for binding, the probe can re-anneal to itself, bringing the reporter dye and quencher dye into close proximity, thus preventing fluorescent signal.",
                                "Two or more molecular beacon probes with different reporter dyes may be used for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms. For example, a first molecular beacon designed with a first reporter dye may be used to indicate the presence of a SNP and a second molecular beacon designed with a second reporter dye may be used to indicate the presence of the corresponding wild-type sequence; in this way, different signals from the first and/or second reporter dyes may be used to determine if a subject is heterozygous for a SNP, homozygous for a SNP, or homozygous wild-type at the corresponding DNA region. By selection of appropriate PCR temperatures and/or extension of the probe length, a molecular beacons may bind to a target PCR product when a nucleotide polymorphism is present but at a slight cost of reduced specificity. Molecular beacons advantageously do not require thermocycling, so temperature optimization of the PCR is simplified.",

FRET hybridization probes typically comprise two DNA probes designed to anneal next to each other in a head-to-tail configuration on the PCR product. Typically, the upstream probe has a fluorescent dye on the 3\u2032 end and the downstream probe has an acceptor dye on the 5\u2032 end. If both probes anneal to the target PCR product, fluorescence from the 3\u2032 dye can be absorbed by the adjacent acceptor dye on the 5\u2032 end of the second probe. As a result, the second dye is excited and can emit light at a third wavelength, which may be detected. If the two dyes do not come into close proximity in the absence of sufficient complimentary DNA, then FRET does not occur between the two dyes. The 3\u2032 end of the second (downstream) probe may be phosphorylated to prevent it from being used as a primer by Taq during PCR amplification. The two probes may encompass a region of 40 to 50 DNA base pairs.",
                                "FRET hybridization probe technology permits melting curve analysis of the amplification product. If the temperature is slowly raised, probes annealing to the target PCR product will be reduced and the FRET signal will be lost. The temperature at which half the FRET signal is lost is referred to as the melting temperature of the probe system. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the target DNA under a hybridization FRET probe will still generate a signal, but the melting curve will display a lower Tm. The lowered Tm can indicate the presence of a specific polymorphism. The target PCR product is detected and the altered Tm informs the user there is a difference in the sequence being detected Like molecular beacons, there is not a specific thermocycling temperature requirement for FRET hybridization probes. Like molecular beacons, FRET hybridization probes have the advantage of being recycled or conserved during PCR temperature cycling, and a fluorescent signal does not accumulate as PCR product accumulates after each PCR cycle.",

A primer and no more than three NTPs may be combined with a polymerase and the target sequence, which serves as a template for amplification. By using less than all four NTPs, it is possible to omit one or more of the polymorphic nucleotides needed for incorporation at the polymorphic site. It is important for the practice of the present invention that the amplification be designed such that the omitted nucleotide(s) is(are) not required between the 3\u2032 end of the primer and the target polymorphism. The primer is then extended by a nucleic acid polymerase, in a preferred embodiment by Taq polymerase. If the omitted NTP is required at the polymorphic site, the primer is extended up to the polymorphic site, at which point the polymerization ceases. However, if the omitted NTP is not required at the polymorphic site, the primer will be extended beyond the polymorphic site, creating a longer product. Detection of the extension products is based on, for example, separation by size/length which will thereby reveal which polymorphism is present. For example, U.S. Publ. No. US20040038258, which is hereby incorporated by reference, describes a form of primer extension.",

If molecules differ in nucleotide sequence, fragments of different sizes may be generated. The fragments can be separated by gel electrophoresis. Restriction enzymes are isolated from a wide variety of bacterial genera and are thought to be part of the cell's defenses against invading bacterial viruses.

Comparison of differentially expressed transcripts between the groups demonstrated that non-pathologic (normal) tissue segregated almost completely from inflamed tissue in all cases. Gene expression profiles in intestinal biopsy tissue from patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ASDIC, while having significant overlap with each other, also showed distinctive features for each group. Taken together, these results presented herein demonstrate that ASDIC children have a gastrointestinal mucosal molecular profile that overlaps significantly with known inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet has distinctive features that further supports the presence of an ASD-associated IBD variant, or, alternatively, a prodromal phase of typical inflammatory bowel disease. Whole transcriptome analysis of biopsy tissue from ASDIC (ASD with ileocolitis) and non-ASD IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) patients has provided molecular evidence for an overlapping, yet unique, IBD-like condition in ASD children. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms that underlie inflammation in the large and small intestines of ASDIC children, the genes and biological pathways that are differentially regulated between inflamed and non-inflamed ileocolonic tissue were examined",

In this eQTL analysis, the SNP's genotype and the first principal components were regressed onto log2 expression for the transcript. Given the modest sample size, only the dominant genetic model was computed. A fixed effect meta-analysis and the corresponding test for heterogeneity of effects were computed across disease groups.

Employing differential expression and principle component analysis methodologies it has been herein found that: (a) DETs in ASDIC distinguish this group from non-inflamed controls (i.e. non-specific ileocolonic cellular infiltrate in GI symptomatic ASD children is not \u201cnormal\u201d), (b) previously published data that demonstrate characteristic DETs in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as compared to non-inflamed controls, was reaffirmed and, (c) DETs in ASDIC cases are distinct from both IBD and non-inflamed typically developing controls, though overlap exists between ASDIC and IBD gene expression profiles.",
                                "An analysis of the three groups consisting of inflamed GI tissue demonstrated extensive intergroup DET overlap in both ileum and colon when compared to non-inflamed controls. The finding of overlap between the Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis samples was expected based on previous comparisons of gene expression in mucosal tissue in IBD patients, however the new findings presented here of DET overlap between ASDIC and IBD (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis) provides further evidence in support of a novel ASD-associated enterocolitis. Perhaps more importantly, although there were significant numbers of overlapping DETs in each of the two tissues for ASDIC, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, the pair-wise comparisons between ASDIC and controls resulted in the largest number of DETs unique to those comparisons (1409 in terminal ileum; 1189 in colonic tissue). This provides important molecular evidence that, while similar to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, gene expression profiles in ASDIC tissue remain significantly distinct not only from those of known IBD conditions but also from those of non-inflamed tissue as well. It remains to be seen specifically how these molecular (gene expression) differences in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and ASDIC are expressed phenotypically.",
                                "In the terminal ileum mucosal tissue, gene expression analysis revealed that for ASDIC, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, a large majority of DETs (59-73%) were down-regulated compared to non-inflamed control tissue. In the pair-wise comparisons for Crohn's disease and for ASDIC, the disease categories that were most significantly represented were: (a) gastrointestinal disease and, (b) inflammatory response/disease. In contrast, for ulcerative colitis, disease categories including cardiovascular disease and connective tissue disorders were significantly represented. All of the categories identified within these comparisons were accompanied by highly significant p values, indicating that in all of these tissues there was a strong association with a pathologic gastrointestinal phenotype. The pathway involvement, while demonstrating some common themes across comparisons (e.g. cell signaling and metabolic processes), was somewhat different for each of the three conditions, highlighting variation in the associated underlying biology that distinguishes them.",
                                "In the colonic mucosal tissue, gene expression analysis revealed that in CD and UC a majority of the DETs were up-regulated (65-68%) whereas in ASDIC the majority of transcripts (69%) were down-regulated. The disease categories significantly represented in ASDIC were gastrointestinal disease and neurologic disease. In the CD samples there was a highly significant association with gene ontologies representing inflammatory disease and immunological disease, as well as gastrointestinal disease. The ulcerative colitis profiles were correlated strongly with organismal injury and nutritional disease. The pathways that showed significant involvement in each of the three comparisons again varied somewhat but, as in the terminal ileal mucosa, generally involved cell signaling and metabolic processes.",
                                "All of the terminal ileal ASDIC samples displayed lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) but only a portion of them also had inflammation (ileitis). To determine the additional impact of ileitis on gene expression in ASDIC cases, an analysis was performed between ASDIC TI samples with (8) and without (17) ileitis. Interestingly, the disease categories most significantly represented by these DETs unique to the LNH+ileitis samples were inflammatory response, immunologic disease and dermatological diseases and conditions. The biological pathways that were found to be significantly regulated in this comparison are largely involved in immune-mediated signaling. This data set adds the additional significant observations that: (1) although the absence of cellular infiltrate does not preclude the presence of a unique molecular signature, the presence of cellular infiltrate (i.e. ileitis) results in further refining the discerning nature of the signature to specific DETs and, (2) the presence of LNH without ileitis in the ASDIC group is associated with unique DETs, suggesting that LNH in the setting of ASD, chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, and cellular infiltrate (anywhere in the bowel) is part of the disease process.",
                                "In summary, the overall gene expression patterns from comparisons of inflamed and non-inflamed tissue in CD, UC and ASDIC exhibited unique DETs as well as some degree of overlap. The dendogram in FIG. 3 displays these relationships for each of the two tissues. The Kruskal-Wallis test results lend further support to the findings in the individual pair-wise comparisons; i.e. DETs in IBD conditions (CD and UC) are more similar to each other than to ASDIC, and all three groups are more similar to each other than to the non-inflamed controls.",
                                "Several aspects of the data are reassuring from a methodological perspective: first, the relatively tight clustering of gene expression profiles from the typically developing non-inflamed group depicted in the PCA for both ileal and colonic mucosa\u2014a clustering that excluded the great majority of those with mucosal inflammation and, second, aberrant gene expression profiles in IBD cases that are in accord with independent reports from other groups (Wu et al. (2007) Inflamm Bowel Dis 13(7): 807-821; Galamb et al. (2006) World J Gastroenterol 12(43): 6998-7006; Costello et al. (2005) PLoS Med 2(8): e199; Lawrance et al. (2001) Hum Mol Genet 10(5): 445-456). Abnormal gene expression in ASDIC tissues is consistent with previous reports of cellular and structural changes within the mucosa (Gonzalez et al. (2005) Arch Venez Pueric Pediat 69: 19-25; Krigsman et al. (2010) Autism Insights 1: 1-11; Torrente et al. (2004) Am J Gastroenterol 4: 598-605; Balzola et al. (2005) Am J Gastroenterol 100: 979-981; Furlano et al. (2001) J Pediatr 38: 366-372) accompanied by pro-inflammatory bias in mucosal CD3+ lymphocyte cytokine profiles (Ashwood et al. (2004) J Clin Immunol 24: 664-673; Ashwood and Wakefield AJ. (2006) J Neuroimmunol 173: 126-134), and a more recent report of abnormal mucosal mRNA profiles in other ASD children who, while suffering GI symptoms, did not appear to have associated mucosal inflammation (Williams et al. (2011) PLoS One 6(9): e24585. Epub 2011 Sep. 16). In the only published study that reports gene expression results in ileal mucosal tissue derived from ASDIC cases compared to controls, Williams et al measured the mRNA levels of three disaccharidases (SI, MGAM and LCT), two glucose transporters (SGLT1 and GLUT2), an enterocyte marker (villin), and a master transcriptional regulator in the intestine (CDX2) (Williams et al. (2011) PLoS One 6(9): e24585). With the exception of villin mRNA (no change), all other transcripts were significantly down-regulated in ASDIC samples compared to controls. Moreover, the ileal expression of the master regulator, CDX2, was a significant predictor of mRNA expression of the three disaccharidases and two transport molecules in ASDIC and ControlIC children, based on linear regression models. Data presented herein correlate well with these findings. In the present study, expression of CDX2 was significantly down-regulated in the ASDIC ileum (2.1 fold) as were 2 of the three enzymes (SI and MGAM), both transporters, and villin. These interesting findings may broaden the GI disease repertoire in ASD to include not only mucosal inflammation, as defined by abnormal cellular infiltrate seen during routine light microscopy, but also molecular abnormalities occurring in the absence of obvious light microscopic changes.",
                                "Additional factors known to influence human intestinal mucosal gene expression include, but are not limited to, age, gender, ethnicity, prescription medications, diet, and dietary supplements. The variety of diets, medications, and nutritional supplements in the ASD-GI group is depicted in Table 7. For the most part ASD-GI children were on a diet that restricted ingestion of both gluten and casein, and in some instances also soy, whereas individuals in the control groups were not on restrictive diets. In addition, food auto-restriction, a common feature in autism, serves to further limit the variety of foods to which the bowel mucosa is exposed and could potentially impact mucosal gene expression. None of the ASDIC cases in this study were receiving medications known to impact inflammatory processes of the intestinal mucosa for at least four weeks prior to obtaining the biopsies. This includes NSAIDS, H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, corticosteroids, antibiotics, probiotics, and immune-suppressants.",
                                "The relatively broad distribution of gene expression profiles in the ASDIC samples represented in the PCA analysis may be attributable to a number of different factors. First, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the larger number of cases in this group, relative to the IBD groups, may account for some of this effect. Heterogeneity in the underlying inflammatory process, its severity and location, as well as the average age of individuals within this group, is among the variables that may influence this distribution. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is also possible that the heterogeneity in gene expression profiles in the ASDIC group is reflective of a disease in various stages of evolution. Therefore it may be speculated that the broad distribution of DETs in ASDIC is reflective of a dynamic process in which the repertoire of DETs is evolving over time, perhaps towards those of other established IBDs.",
                                "Taken as a whole, the picture that emerges is one in which GI symptomatic children with ASD in whom cellular infiltrate is present in the ileum and colon have a distinct molecular signature that is consistent with the larger disease categories of gastrointestinal disease, and more specifically, overlaps with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and autoimmunity, and is associated with digestive system development, function, and pathophysiology, and also with neurological disease. The shared uniquely expressed DETs seen in both the ileum and colon suggest that intestinal mucosal inflammatory infiltrates in the setting of GI symptomatic patients with ASD reflect a single unifying autoimmune process at play in both the small and large bowel.",

These 20 SNP-transcript combinations reside in 3 regions with the strongest association being between rs1127155 and NM\u2014152559 (P=3.1\u00d710E-12). This probe corresponds to Williams Beuren syndrome chromosome region 27 on chr 7q11.23-a 1.5 MB deletion that includes this gene and 26 other genes is known to cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Williams Beuren Syndrome. Within the colon, 34 SNP-transcript combinations met the p<1\u00d710E-9 and fold change >1.5 threshold. The top SNP-transcript combination was rs6460055 and NM\u2014152559 (8.0\u00d710E-11), the same transcript and region found in the terminal illium. The rs1127155 and NM\u2014152559 combination was ranked 4th (P=1.6\u00d710E-9). Rs 1127155 and rs6460055 are in linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.90). Additional analyses have the potential to identify eQTL that associate in specific tissue and that have contrasting expression levels between disease groups and controls.",
