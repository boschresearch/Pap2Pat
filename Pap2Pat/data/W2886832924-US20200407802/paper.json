    "date": "2018-07-01",
    "abstract": "DNA methylation loss occurs frequently in cancer genomes, primarily within lamina-associated, late-replicating regions termed Partially Methylated Domains (PMDs). We profiled 39 diverse primary tumors and 8 matched adjacent tissues using Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), and analyzed them alongside 343 additional human and 206 mouse WGBS datasets. We identified a local CpG sequence context associated with preferential hypomethylation in PMDs. Analysis of CpGs in this context (\u201cSolo-WCGWs\u201d) revealed previously undetected PMD hypomethylation in almost all healthy tissue types. PMD hypomethylation increases with age in both fetal and postnatal tissues, appearing to track accumulation of cell divisions beginning early in life. In cancer, the degree of PMD hypomethylation correlates with somatic mutation density and expression of cell-cycle dependent genes, reinforcing its mitotic clock-like role. We propose that late replication leads to progressive methylation loss throughout an individual's lifespan, potentially contributing to the onset of cancer and acting as a biomarker for cellular aging.

                        "We sequenced TCGA tumors and adjacent normal samples using paired-end WGBS at ~15\u00d7 sequence depth, to compile a set of 40 core tumor samples and 9 core normal samples (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 1). We first defined a set of shared PMDs and HMDs across the majority of our 49 core sample set using an existing HMM-based method, MethPipe 27 (Supplementary Fig. 1a and Online Methods). Previous studies have suggested that DNA methylation is associated with local sequence context, including local CpG density 28,29 and nucleotides directly flanking the CpG 29 . We used the shared MethPipe PMD set (excluding CpG islands) to determine local CpG density and tetranucleotide sequence contexts most predictive of DNA hypomethylation.",
                        "Low CpG density within windows of +/-35 bp was optimal for predicting PMD-specific hypomethylation (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Additionally, CpGs flanked by an A:T (\"W\") on both sides (WCGW tetranucleotides) were consistently more prone to DNA hypomethylation than those flanked by a C:G (\"S\") on either (SCGW) or both (SCGS) sides (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1c). In colon tumors and adjacent normal tissues, low CpG density and the WCGW context contributed additively to hypomethylation (Fig. 1b,upper). The most hypomethylation-prone sequence context was at CpGs with the combination of zero neighboring CpGs (\"solo\") and the WCGW motif. In two \"adjacent normal\" colon samples, only these solo-WCGW CpGs showed significant hypomethylation (Fig. 1b, upper). These same sequence dependencies were apparent in a colorectal tumor and normal colon tissue from mice (Fig. 1b, lower). They were consistent within all other tumor and adjacent normal samples in the core set, using either the WGBS data (Supplementary Fig. 2a) or matched Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (HM450) microarray data (Supplementary Fig. 2b). An additional 390 human and 206 mouse WGBS samples examined later exhibited the same pattern (Supplementary Fig. 3a-b), with the exception of three germ cell samples (Supplementary Fig. 3c).",
                        "We focused all subsequent analyses on solo-WCGWs, representing 13% of all CpGs in the human genome. While they represent only the extreme of a hypomethylation process that affects other CpGs, focusing on solo-WCGWs alone enhanced the signal of PMD/HMD structure, especially in normal adjacent tissues and weakly hypomethylated tumors such as COAD-3518 (Fig. 1c). The relatively shallow hypomethylation in COAD-3518 could not be attributed to a greater fraction of non-cancer cells in this sample, as the cancer cell fraction in this sample was estimated (by ABSOLUTE 30 ) to be 80%, compared to 51% for the more strongly hypomethylated COAD-A00R; this suggested that PMD depth was quantitative and driven by an independent property of the cancer cells.",
                        "In addition to enhancing the PMD/HMD signal in high coverage WGBS data, solo-WCGW CpGs allowed accurate PMD structure to be determined with average genomic read coverage as low as 0.05\u00d7 in down-sampled bulk WGBS data (Supplementary Fig. 4a), and in low-coverage single-cell WGBS data 31 (Supplementary Fig. 4b), suggesting a possible application for low coverage or single-cell WGBS studies."

                        "Genomic plots of solo-WCGW CpG mean methylation revealed strong concordance between PMD locations in all samples in the core set (Fig. 2a). Comparing the average solo-WCGW methylation of the core tumors vs the core normals in multi-scale plots (Fig. 2b) confirmed that PMDs ranging from 100 kb to 5 mb 32 were mostly overlapping between tumors and normals, but less hypomethylated in the normals.",
                        "Given the high variability of solo-WCGW PMD hypomethylation across samples (Fig 2a ), we compared the standard deviation (SD) of 100-kb bins across our core normal tissues and across core tumors, finding that PMDs had higher SD than HMDs within each group (Fig. 2c). Genome-wide, SD was bimodally distributed within 100-kb bins in both normal and tumor core groups (Fig. 2d), unlike mean methylation (Supplementary Fig. 5) and all other features examined (not shown). While the highly variable nature of hypomethylation in PMDs has been noted previously 5,7 , it has not been used as a method for identifying PMDs. Using the bimodal SD peaks as a classifier resulted in a segmentation of the genome into HMDs and PMDs, with PMDs covering 63% of the genome in the core tumors (SD>0.125), and 66% of the genome in the core normals (SD>0.07). Strikingly, this simple method resulted in 100-kb bin classifications that were 83% concordant between the normal and tumor groups (Fig. 2d). These PMDs covered 95% of the base pairs in PMDs previously reported in colorectal cancer 6 , and 93% of PMDs in the IMR90 fibroblast cell line 12 (Supplementary Fig. 6). This SD-based classification of PMDs allowed us to rescale methylation values for individual samples based on their sample-specific degree of PMD hypomethylation (Fig. 2e-f), further illustrating the high degree of concordance in PMD/HMD structure across tumor and normal samples."

As in the core set, the overall degree of hypomethylation varied widely, but PMD structure was largely shared for 5 of the 6 categories. Common PMDs overlapped lamina-associated regions (LADs) 33 and late replicating domains, as expected (Fig. 3a and Fig. 4, bottom). The germline and embryo (GE) category was the only exception, with only some samples sharing PMDs (Fig. 3a, Group GE, Fig. 4, Group GE). Immortalized cell lines (cancer and non-cancer), with the exception of pluripotent embryonic cells, generally showed strongly hypomethylated PMDs that were shared with other groups (Fig. 3a, Group CL, Fig. 4, Group ESC). More discussion on methylation maintenance in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells is given in the Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig. 7a.",
                        "In agreement with the TCGA tumor-adjacent \"normals\", most disease-free post-natal tissues showed PMD structure shared with tumors and other groups (Fig. 3a, Group PN and Fig. 4, Group PN). The normal human samples from Schultz et al. 25 made up the majority of nonbrain samples in our PN group and clearly had shared PMDs in our solo-WCGW analysis, while the original analysis of Schultz et al. identified PMDs in only 3 of these 37 samples.",
                        "Most brain samples in the PN group were from a different study 34 , and these stood out as the one post-natal tissue type without clearly detectable PMDs in our analysis, possibly attributable to de novo DNA methylation in post-mitotic brain cells 34 . Tissue types with high stem cell turnover 35 including liver, colon, skin, and pancreas displayed the strongest PMD hypomethylation.",
                        "All nucleated blood cell types showed shared PMD structure, in contrast to an earlier analysis of many of the same WGBS datasets 41 that found PMD hypomethylation to be limited to the lymphoid lineage (Fig. 3a, Group PB). Both B cells and T cells could generally be divided into subgroups of strong vs. weak hypomethylation. Those subtypes having undergone antigen presentation and activation (e.g., memory B/T cells, regulatory T cells, germinal center B cells, and plasma cells) fell into the strongly hypomethylated class, while na\u00efve B and T cells fell into the weakly hypomethylated class, consistent with earlier reports showing that B and T cell hypomethylation increased during maturation 23,24 . However, unlike these earlier reports, our solo-WCGW analysis showed that PMD hypomethylation was already clearly evident by the na\u00efve stage (Figure 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7b). Lymphocyte activation involves clonal expansion (proliferation of individual B/T cells to produce large numbers of daughter cells with the same antigen specificity) 36 , and the dramatic hypomethylation that occurs after activation strengthens the notion that methylation loss accumulates during successive rounds of cell division (as shown explicitly in long term cultures 21 ). Our solo-WCGW analysis provided the first demonstration that PMDs occur across all cell types of the myeloid lineage and are largely shared with other cell types (Figure 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7c).",
                        "The tumor group (TM) consisted of 50 solid tumors (largely made up of the 40 core tumors shown previously), plus 50 hematopoietic malignancies (Fig. 3a, Group TM). Interestingly, while hematopoietic tumors had more strongly hypomethylated PMDs than normal hematopoietic samples, they generally followed the trend established by their developmental origin: those derived from myeloid cells (AML) had shallower PMDs than those derived from lymphoid cells (CLL, MCL, TPLL, MM) (one-way Wilcoxon test, p=9.69e-7). The notable exception among lymphoid-derived tumors was ALL, which had hypomethylation levels similar to normal lymphoid cells. The lower degree of hypomethylation in ALL (derived from childhood cases) may reflect the generally lower degree of hypomethylation in cells from younger individuals, a topic investigated below.",
                        "For five of the six cell type groups (excluding group \"GE\"), mean methylation across samples in the group (Fig. 3b), as well as SD (Fig. 3c-d), revealed largely shared PMD structure. SD was bimodally distributed across the genome in all five groups (Fig. 3e), and could thus be used to define PMD regions. For all of the five sample groups, the majority of PMDs defined by high-SD bins were substantially overlapping PMDs defined earlier from the core tumor group (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 8). For example, 82% of high-SD bins were overlapping between the post-natal non-blood group (PN) and the core tumor group, and 84% were overlapping between the post-natal blood group (PB) and the core tumor group. Our findings reinforce the idea that a large set of cell-type-invariant PMDs dominate the hypomethylation landscape in most tissues."

                        "The presence of PMD hypomethylation in multiple fetal tissue types led us to further investigate solo-WCGW methylation in gametes and early developmental stages (Fig. 5a-c). Human sperm was highly methylated, with little discernable PMD structure aside from the peri-centromeric region (Fig. 5a, Group I), while mouse methylomes displayed consistent PMD structures throughout spermatogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 9). Human germinal vesicle oocytes had deep PMD hypomethylation (Fig. 5a, Group II), although a subset of PMD boundaries appeared to differ from somatic tissues. The rapid and global demethylation that occurs within the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) is thought to be an active process, attributable to a different mechanism than PMD-associated hypomethylation 37 . Interestingly, while ICM and blastocyst samples were strongly de-methylated, they did retain weak PMDs with boundaries resembling those of oocytes rather than those of later somatic cell types (Fig. 5a, Group III). Primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are set aside from the soma soon after implantation, showed an even more extreme erasure of DNA methylation than blastocysts, precluding any discernable PMD structure (Fig. 5a, Group IV). Embryonic somatic tissues (Fig, 5a, Group V) were rapidly re-methylated genome-wide, and PMD structure could not be readily resolved, in contrast to more mature fetal samples (Fig. 5a, Group VI). Tissues sampled at different developmental stages revealed a progressive emergence of PMD/HMD structure along organismal development (Fig. 5c). This analysis revealed a substantial degree of similarity between PMD structure in brain tissues and PMD structure in other lineages, something that was not apparent from genomic plots. The substantial similarity of PMD structure detected between ICMs, ESCs, embryonic (<8 weeks) stages, and post-natal samples, suggests that PMD hypomethylation may begin at the earliest stages of development. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that the degree of hypomethylation observed at the fetal and postnatal stages for each cell type largely mirror the lineage-specific hypomethylation rate within the same embryonic cell type."

                        "To investigate the link between PMD-associated hypomethylation and cumulative numbers of cell divisions, we tested whether solo-WCGW methylation level within common PMDs was associated with donor age in different primary cell types. A strong age association was evident from the WGBS profile of sorted CD4+ T cells from a newborn vs. those from a 103-year-old individual, with the latter being closer to a T cell derived leukemia than to the newborn sample (Fig. 6a). To investigate age-related properties within larger studies only performed using the HM450 platform, we used the common PMDs derived from all WGBS samples to define a standard set of solo-WCGW PMD probes represented on HM450 (Online Methods). In these larger studies, PBMC samples from newborns had significantly less PMD hypomethylation than those from elderly donors (Fig. 6b left), and fetal liver samples had significantly less PMD hypomethylation than adult liver samples (Fig. 6b, right). Strikingly, fetal tissues from four different developmental lineages showed nearly linear accumulation of hypomethylation from 9 weeks post-gestation to 22 weeks postgestation (Fig. 6c). Despite small sample sizes, this was statistically significant for 3 of the 4 fetal tissue types. A similar association was observed between PMD hypomethylation and gestational age in multiple mouse fetal tissue types (Supplementary Fig. 10).",
                        "An earlier study used the HM450 platform to investigate the effects of environmental (UV) exposure on PMD hypomethylation in human skin samples 26 . While the earlier study described PMD hypomethylation as only occurring within the sun-exposed samples of the epidermal layer, our re-analysis of solo-WCGWs revealed that both dermal and epidermal cells exhibited age-associated PMD hypomethylation without sun exposure, but that this process was dramatically accelerated specifically in epidermal cells upon sun exposure (Fig. 6d). This suggests that while PMD hypomethylation is a nearly universal process in aging, the degree of hypomethylation is a reflection of the complete mitotic history of the cell, including proliferation associated with normal development and tissue maintenance, plus additional cell turnover occurring as a consequence of environmental insults. HM450 datasets showed that diverse hematopoietic cell types had a significant association between donor age and degree of hypomethylation, with the myeloid lineage (Fig. 6e) having a much slower rate of age-associated loss compared to the lymphoid lineage (Fig. 6f). This finding is consistent with the overall lower degree of methylation observed in myeloid cell types from WGBS data. While the rate of loss within the myeloid lineage was extremely low, the association to donor age was highly significant within the large human monocyte dataset (Fig. 6e). This finding contradicts an earlier analysis based on many of the same samples, which found that monocytes lacked PMD hypomethylation and ageassociated hypomethylation 24 ."

                        "We studied the landscape of cancer hypomethylation in 9,072 tumors from 33 cancer types included in TCGA, using the HM450 solo-WCGWs located within common PMDs (Fig. 7a). PMD hypomethylation was nearly universal but showed extensive variation both within and across cancer types. Comparison to 749 adjacent normals from TCGA showed that the relative degree of hypomethylation across cancer types was correlated with that of the disease-free tissue of origin (Supplementary Fig. 111213). This association was reduced in cancer types for which the normal adjacent specimens contained low fractions of relevant cell types representing putative cells of origin for the tumor. Somatic mutation events are known to display mitotic clock-like properties 38 . Within TCGA tumors, we found that higher genome-wide somatic mutation densities were significantly associated with deeper PMD hypomethylation, suggesting that mitotic turnover may underlie both somatic mutation and PMD hypomethylation (Fig. 7b). This association was consistent using different purity thresholds (Supplementary Fig. 13c), indicating that it was not the result of confounding due to differential detection sensitivity related to purity.",
                        "PMD hypomethylation was also associated with somatic copy number aberration density (Supplementary Fig. 13d). Activation and insertion of LINE-1 endogenous retrotransposable elements is a common event in human cancer and can induce structural alterations, copy number alterations, and induction of oncogenes [39][40][41] . Using somatic LINE-1 insertions identified from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of TCGA tumors 41 , we found that LINE-1 insertion breakpoints were preferentially enriched in PMD regions (Fig. 7c), in agreement with an earlier study 39 . Intriguingly, tumors with deeper PMD hypomethylation had more LINE-1 insertions in 8 of 9 cancer types, with the only exception being endometrial cancer (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Fig. 14). While the mechanisms controlling LINE-1 insertion density in cancer are not well understood, they may be stochastically linked to the number of cell divisions (like SNVs), and/or require derepression of \"hot\" LINE-1 elements, a process which may be linked to DNA hypomethylation 42,43 .",
                        "We reasoned that tumors highly proliferative at the time of specimen collection may also reflect an extensive history of past cell division. Using TCGA samples with matched gene expression data, we identified the 60 genes most strongly associated with PMD hypomethylation, finding that these genes were most enriched in Gene Ontology functional terms associated with proliferation and mitotic cell division (Fig. 7e). In further support of this link between ongoing cell proliferation and PMD hypomethylation, the genes with the greatest association to PMD hypomethylation were strongly enriched within a list of 350 cell-cycle dependent genes from Cyclebase 44 (Fig. 7f). Ranking tumor samples by their degree of PMD hypomethylation showed that this association involved most cell-cycle dependent genes across different mitotic stages (Fig. 7g). Remarkably, proliferative tumors had deep PMD hypomethylation despite having higher levels of both DNMT1 and DNMT3A/B, which are expressed as part of a general DNA replication program (Supplementary Note). The most hypomethylated tumors also had high expression of UHRF1 (a contributor to DNMT1 methylation maintenance activity), underscoring that PMD hypomethylation accumulates despite strong expression of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery. We also investigated whether overexpression of TET genes, which participate in active DNA demethylation, might contribute to PMD hypomethylation. None of the three TET genes were highest in the tumors with strongly hypomethylated PMDs, indicating that TET enzymes are not responsible for DNA methylation loss in PMD regions (in contrast to promoters and CpG islands, where extensive evidence exists for TETmediated demethylation). All of our tumor mutation and expression results suggest cumulative mitotic cell divisions as the major driving force behind PMD hypomethylation accumulation."

                        "We used the one cell type with publicly available data for all relevant histone and topological marks, IMR90, to systematically analyze our solo-WCGW based PMD definition. This analysis confirmed previous findings 6,7 that HMD/PMD structure coincided with nuclear architecture, as characterized by Hi-C A/B compartments, Lamin B1 distribution and replication timing (Fig. 8a). At the single CpG scale, Solo-WCGW CpG methylation was most strongly correlated with replication timing, followed by the histone mark H3K36me3 (Supplementary Fig. 15a). The de novo methyltransferase DNMT3B has recently been shown to be guided to transcribed gene bodies via a direct interaction with the H3K36 methylation mark 45 . Active genes marked by H3K36me3 are overwhelmingly located in early replicating regions, and it has been suggested that both active transcription of gene bodies and early replication timing contribute to differential methylation throughout the genome 9 . To disentangle the contributions of H3K36me3 and replication timing to genomewide DNA methylation levels and PMDs, we performed a stratified analysis of all solo-WCGW CpGs in the genome (Fig. 8b-c). We found that the 14% of Solo-WCGWs overlapping H3K36me3 were highly methylated, irrespective of position relative to gene annotations or replication timing (Fig. 8b,left). The remaining 86% of Solo-WCGWs (those not overlapping an H3K36me3 peak) had lower methylation across all contexts, but were strongly replication-timing dependent (Fig. 8b,right). In IMR90 cells, the degree of methylation maintenance associated with early replication timing was even greater than the degree associated with H3K36me3 (Fig. 8b, right). The relative contribution of replication timing vs. H3K36me3 was reversed in the H1 (hESC) cell line (Fig. 8c), a cell type with exceptionally high DNMT3A/B activity that makes them one of the few cell types able to survive loss of Dnmt1 function 46,47 . Because most somatic cell types had detectably hypomethylated PMDs like IMR90 (and unlike H1), our observations support a model in which highly effective methylation maintenance at H3K36me3-marked regions is achieved through a process mediated by the direct recruitment of DNMT3B through its PWWP domain 45 . Consistent with earlier observations 9 , this H3K36me3-linked maintenance appears to act independently from the effect of replication timing on PMD methylation loss (Fig. 8d)."

                "In this study, we identified four distinct features influencing DNA methylation levels in large portions of the human and mouse genomes: First, the local sequence context of the CpG dinucleotide; second, the timing of DNA replication; third, the presence of the H3K36me3 histone mark; and fourth, the accumulated number of cell divisions. The sequence context, replication timing, and H3K36me3 marks each confer differential susceptibility to replication-associated DNA methylation loss, and thus collectively shape PMD/HMD structure, while the degree of PMD hypomethylation is a function of the cumulative number of cell divisions from the earliest stages of embryonic development.",
                "We showed that two local sequence features (CpG density and the WCGW sequence context) exert a strong influence on the rate of DNA methylation loss at individual CpGs within PMDs, and that these influences are consistent across cell types and species. The bulk of DNA methylation maintenance is performed by DNMT1 and augmented by DNMT3A/ B 48 . DNMT1 has been shown to act processively, with increased efficiency in the presence of multiple CpG sites in close proximity 49 , a feature consistent with the poorer methylation maintenance of \"solo\" CpGs (Fig. 8e). In vitro biochemical studies have yielded conflicting findings regarding the role of the immediate CpG flanking positions on DNMT1 activity, with one study suggesting higher affinity for G/C rich flanking sequences 50 , and another suggesting higher affinity for A/T rich sequences 51 . The in vivo effects of the WCGW motif described here on methylation maintenance efficiency should be followed up with careful mechanistic studies to identify the causative factor or factors. The discovery of the Solo-WCGW signature largely allowed for our improved analysis of HMD/PMD structure, which may lead to better characterization of not just the \"common PMDs\" studied here but also important classes of cell-type-specific PMDs 6,7,14,52 (Supplementary Note).",
                "Most Solo-WCGW were not marked by H3K36me3, and we identified replication timing as the major determinant for methylation levels at these H3K36me3-negative CpGs. We propose that replication late in S phase provides the cell with less time for re-methylation of newly synthesized daughter strands during DNA replication (Fig. 8f). This re-methylation window model is supported by a recent study that reconstructed methylation gains and losses at individual CpGs upon clonal expansions of individual somatic cells in culture 21 , showing that progressive methylation loss was most pronounced at late-replicating domains. Further strengthening the re-methylation window model, biochemical studies have shown that re-methylation during mitosis is in fact relatively slow and not fully completed until after the S-G2 checkpoint 53,54 . Therefore, re-methylation efficiency is likely dependent on the time window between daughter strand synthesis and the beginning of M-phase. This is consistent with the mitotic clock-like PMD methylation loss we observe specifically within late-replicating regions (Fig. 8f).",
                "The presence of H3K36me3 appeared to override this late-replication associated methylation loss at Solo-WCGW CpGs (Fig. 8d). Genetic evidence suggests that maintenance of DNA methylation at H3K36me3-marked CpGs is mediated by the direct recruitment of DNMT3B to H3K36me3-marked nucleosomes 45,55 . The independent contributions of replication timing and H3K36me3 are consistent with earlier findings based on actively transcribed gene bodies 9 , and help to resolve the long-standing paradox concerning positive associations between actively transcribed gene bodies and DNA methylation 56 . This would also explain why head and neck squamous cell carcinomas with NSD1 mutations, which exhibit significant reductions in H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 levels 57 , have substantial loss of DNA methylation in the HMD compartment (Supplementary Fig. 15b). It is important to note that the two major genomic contexts we found to contribute to hypomethylation, are strongly associated with specific nuclear territories (Fig. 8g). As the heterochromatin likely represents a distinct compartment separated by a physical boundary, we cannot rule out other compositional differences of this compartment contributing to the less efficient DNA methylation maintenance observed there.",
                "A number of studies have identified specific CpGs predictive of chronological age [58][59][60] as well as gestation age at birth 61 . These signatures are largely non-overlapping with PMDs, as shown in earlier work 26 and with the PMD solo-WCGWs identified here. We believe this is because PMD hypomethylation captures underlying mitotic dynamics, which are only loosely associated with chronological age per se. Organismal aging and the associated physiological changes affect transcriptional regulation of various genes and pathways, and many or most of the loci identified on the basis of age alone [58][59][60] likely represent transcriptionally-coupled chromatin changes at these genes (for example, changes to Somatostatin which regulated growth hormone 58 ). As we have shown, PMD hypomethylation is likely a more direct clock-like readout of mitotic age, which is generally correlated with chronological age but can be accelerated by environmental factors or processes that promote cell turnover, such as cellular damage, wounding, inflammation, etc. DNA hypomethylation has long been proposed to allow the aberrant expression and transposition of retroelements that can play a role in cancer by inducing chromosomal aberrations at the point of insertion [62][63][64][65][66] . Genetically engineered Dnmt1 hypomorphism in mouse was shown to cause lymphomas frequently harboring retrotranspon-induced Notch1 activation events 43 . Whole-genome sequencing has shown that approximately 50% of human tumors contain somatic retrotranspositions of LINE-1 elements, and that these often lead to structural alterations 39,40,67,68 enriched within PMDs 39 . In one study, human lung tumors exhibiting mobilization of LINE-1 elements shared a common DNA hypomethylation signature 42 . Across a large TCGA cohort, we showed that tumors with higher degrees of PMD hypomethylation are more likely to have LINE-1 insertions (Fig. 7cd). This evidence is correlative in nature, and it is certainly possible that LINE-1 activity is caused by a methylation-independent event. However, our new results are consistent with the genetic models cited above, and it is tempting to hypothesize that LINE-1 activity could be accelerated by PMD hypomethylation.",
                "The methylation loss process described here affects a sizeable fraction of all CpGs in the genome, and thus could exert a significant influence on methylation-dependent mutational processes, most importantly CpG to TpG substitutions driven by methylation-dependent deamination of CpGs. This mutational signature accounts for a large fraction of single nucleotide mutations observed in both evolution and cancer, and thus we might expect systematic DNA methylation changes to influence the rate of these mutations. A simplistic model would predict that hypomethylated solo-WCGWs within late replicating PMDs would be protected from deamination and thus have a lower CpG to TpG mutation rate. Indeed, we observed some evidence in support of this model for both somatic mutations (from tumor sequencing) and de novo mutations in the human germline (from whole-genome trio sequencing). This analysis, described in detail in Supplementary Fig. 16 and the Supplementary Note, does not take into account other important factors such as the rate of transcription-coupled DNA repair, and should be confirmed in future studies.

While the fraction of the genome covered by PMDs in different samples differed by two to three folds (Supplementary Fig. 1b), there was sufficient overlap to define a shared MethPipe PMD set of 417 PMDs (covering 13% of the genome) that was shared among at least 21 of the 30 tumors.

The more conservative sets of \"common PMDs\" and \"common HMDs\" are defined by the criteria that SD>0.15 and SD<0.10 respectively.

This results in 6,214 probes in common PMDs and 9,040 probes in common HMDs. Four letter acronyms for cancer types were taken following the official TCGA nomenclature. We used the difference of methylation between the mean methylation of solo-WCGW probes located in common PMDs and those in common HMDs to measure the degree of PMD-associated DNA hypomethylation in each sample.
