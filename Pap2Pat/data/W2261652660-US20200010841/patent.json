    "title": "NOVEL REVERSIBLE EXPRESSION SYSTEM FOR TRANSGENE EXPRESSION IN PLANTS",
    "date": "2016-04-18 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the development of expression cassettes to achieve tapetum specific reversible expression of transgene in female heterotic parent and in F1 progeny in the plants. The expression cassettes are based on the transcription regulation and light signaling. It includes two vector construct; female expression construct and male regulatory construct. The female expression construct was used to achieve tapetum specific expression of reporter gene while when cross is made with male plants having regulatory cassette, F1 plants were formed with abolished expression of reporter gene. Further, the system was deployed to achieve complete male sterility using candidate gene of male sterility; BECLIN1/ATG6 and successfully restoring the fertility of F1 by crossing with pollen of male regulatory transgenic. Here, we claim the expression system using which reversible male sterility can be achieved by expressing candidate gene for male sterility like BECLIN1 or other.",

                        "Hybrid vigor, or heterosis, refers to the phenomenon in which the progeny derived from a cross of two inbred lines outperform the parent lines. For example, hybrid crops can produce 15-50% higher yields than inbred varieties (Tester M, Langridge P. (2010) Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world. Science 327:818-22). The utilization of heterosis has produced tremendous economic benefits in worldwide crop production. More than half of the production of major crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, rapeseed, and sunflower comes from hybrid varieties (Li S, Yang D, Zhu Y. 2007. Characterization and use of male sterility in hybrid rice breeding. J. Integr. Plant Biol. 49:791-804). Thus, hybrid breeding contributes significantly to the food supply in the world.",
                        "The manifestation of heterosis are increase yield, reproductive ability, size, better quality, resistance to disease and pests, greater adaptability. Hybrid plants have become increasingly important in various commercial food crops around the world. The development of hybrid crops has been one of the major factors behind a dramatic increase in global crop yields. Such improvement is achieved through the selective and controlled breeding of two inbred parent lines, which upon crossing delivers heterosis, or \u2018hybrid vigour\u2019. This boost in performance, combining the best yield, quality and agronomic characters from each parent, is the result of hybrid breeding.",
                        "The hybrid vigor conceptualized (Zirkle C. (1952) Early ideas on inbreeding and crossbreeding, in: Gowen J. W. (Ed.), Heterosis, Iowa State College Press, Ames, pp. 1-13) while Charles Darwin (1876), who was the first scientist to examine the phenomenon in a systematic manner (Darwin C. (1876) The effects of cross and self fertilization in the vegetable kingdom, Murray, London), W. J. Beal in maize (Beal W. J. (1880) Indian corn, Rept Michigan State Board. Agr. 19, 279-289.), Shull in plant breeding (Shull G. H. (1952) Beginnings of the heterosis concept, in: Gowen J. W. (Ed.), Heterosis, Iowa State College Press, Ames, pp. 14-48) observed. Corn was the first hybrid seed crop to be marketed extensively, and it is still the most important economic crop grown in the U.S. The most successful breeding efforts of 20th century are production of hybrid varieties of maize in US (six-fold increase between 1930-to-1990), cotton in India and rice in China.",
                        "Producing hybrid seeds of self-pollinating plants requires emasculation; the removal of functional pollen grains to prevent self-pollination. Before the mid-twentieth century, emasculation in hybrid seed production involved manual labour, machines, or chemical treatments and thus was costly, inefficient, and even damaging to the environment.",
                        "Another method is the induction of male sterility. Male sterility refers to the failure to produce dehiscent anthers, functional pollen, and viable male gametes. Male sterility was first observed by the German botanist Joseph Gottlieb K\u2032olreuter in (1763), male sterility has been reported in more than 610 plant species (Kaul MLH. 1988. Male Sterility in Higher Plants. New York: Springer-Verlag). The use of male sterility (MS) reduces the cost of hybrid seed by eliminating the process of emasculation, also has several advantage over conventional breeding methods. There are three main types of male sterility observed in nature. All three types of male sterility are used in commercial breeding programs to ensure cross-pollination to produce hybrid seeds in different crops; a) Genetic male sterility (GMS), a) Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and c) Cytoplasmic genetic male sterility (CGMS).",
                        "In genetic male sterility (GMS), pollen sterility is caused by nuclear gene alone. The use of GSM is limited as, (i) GMS is less stable. Sometimes, sterile plants become fertile under low temperature conditions. (ii) In GMS, the lines segregate into male sterile and fertile plants in 1:1 ratio. (iii) Conversion of a genotype into GMS needs selfing after each backcross to isolate recessive genes and hence more number of generations is required. (iv) It requires more area as 50% of the population is fertile. (v) The quantity of seed produced is less. (vi) There is possibility of admixture if fertile plants are not properly rogued out (Singh Suman Bala, Singh Phundan, Mayee C D (2012) MALE STERILITY IN COTTON. CICR technical bulletin no: 24). For the production of the hybrid seed, complete restoration of fertility is required which is constrain in using GMS, also broader crop applicability is also a limitation, although, environment-sensitive GMS (EGMS) systems are also reported in some crops.",
                        "Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), which is caused by mitochondrial genes with coupled nuclear genes, manifestation of male sterility in these may be both entirely controlled by cytoplamsic factors (cytoplasmic) or by the interaction between cytoplasmic and nuclear factors. They follow cytoplasmic inheritance (non-mendelian inheritance). Here the sterility is transmitted only through the female and all progeny will be sterile. This is applicable to those crops where the economic product is other than seed (vegetative part). It lack restoration of F1, therefore a separate parent (maintainer line) is required for the propagation.",
                        "When nuclear genes for fertility restoration (Rf) are available for CMS system in any crop, it is called as cytoplasmic genetic male sterility (CGMS). This type of male sterility has provision for restoration of fertility, which is not possible in cytoplasmic male sterility. The fertility is restored by the Rf gene (s) present in the nucleus. Thus, the combination of both nuclear genes and cytoplasmic factors determines the fertility or sterility in such plants. The use of this system has limitations like, a) In CGMS, only limited number of crosses can be made due to availability of limited number of restorers. b) CMS is solely controlled by cytoplasmic genes and hence it may have some adverse effect on other characters. c) It is not possible to breed a variety from CMS line.",
                        "The use of genetic engineering in inducing male sterility is called transgenic male sterility. The first transgenic system was described by Mariani, 1990 (Mariani C., Beuckleer D, Truettner J, Leemans J and Goldberg R B (1990) Nature, 347, 737-741). The male gametophytic (microspore) or sporophytic (microspore mother cell (MMC), tapetum, middle layer, stomium cell) tissue were targeted which ablation resulted male sterility. Of the said tissue male sporophytic tissue tapetum ablation and impaired degeneration was targeted by several worker to achieve male sterility. Tapetum is innermost wall layer of male reproductive organ anther. Tapetum synthesise pollen wall material, enzymes, nutrients, secondary metabolites etc. and deliver to the developing microspores. When pollen tetrad form as result of meiosis in MMC the tetrad is surrounded in callose matrix, tapetum releases calase enzyme which is degrade callose and microspores releases from callose matrix. Post meiotic tapetum undergo PCD like degeneration to release nutrients, callase enzyme, pollen wall material which are important for pollen viability. It is reported that alteration in the tapetal PCD either early or delayed resulted pollen abortion and male sterility.",
                        "The genes that are used to generate male sterile plants by interfering tapetal degeneration are: BARNASE (RNase) (Mariani et al., 1990; Block and Debrouwer 1993; Roberts et al., 1995; Zhan et al., 1996; Block et al., 1997; Jagannath et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2006; Roque et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2008; Liu and Liu, 2008; Garcia-Sogo et al., 2010), RNase T-I (Mariani et al., 1990; Denis et al., 1993), Mammalian uncoupling protein (George et al., 1990), Diptheria toxin A-chain (Koltunow et al., 1990; Thorsness et al., 1993; Twell, 1995; Lee et al, 2003; Liu and Liu, 2008; Guerineau et al., 2003), BAX (Kawanabe, T., Ariizumi, T., Kawai-Yamada, M., Uchimiya, H. and Toriyama, K. (2006) Abolition of the tapetum suicide program ruins microsporogenesis. Plant Cell Physiol. 47, 784-787), AtBECLIN1 (Sudhir Pratap Singh, Tripti Pandey, Rakesh Srivastav, Praveen C. Verma, Praduman K. Singh, Rakesh Tuli and Samir V. Sawant (2010) BECLIN 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana under the generic control of regulated expression systems, a strategy for developing male sterile plants. Plant Biotech. J. 8, 1005-1022).",
                        "Tapetum specific expression of melon ethylene receptor genes (ETR1/H69A and ERS1/H70A) delays tapetum generation followed by male sterility (Takada, K., Ishimaru, K., Minamisawa, K., Kamada, H. and Ezura, H (2005a) Expression of a mutated melon ethylene receptor gene Cm-ETR1/H69A affects stamen development in Nicotiana tabacum. Plant Sci. 169, 935-942). An apoptotic protein inhibitor was identified in Arabidopsis, Bax Inhibitor-1. Kawanabe et al. (2006) showed that expression of Arabidopsis Bax Inhibitor-1 (AtBI-1) in tapetum inhibited its degeneration, by blocking cell death pathway, and subsequently resulted pollen abortion (Kawanabe, T., Ariizumi, T., Kawai-Yamada, M., Uchimiya, H. and Toriyama, K. (2006) Abolition of the Tapetum Suicide Program Ruins Microsporogenesis. Plant Cell Physiol. 47(6), 784-787). Cysteine proteases from Brassica, BoCysP1 and BoCP3, have been identified as candidate genes for male sterility. These proteins found to inhibit programmed cell death of tapetum (Konagaya, K., Ando, S., Kamachi, S., Tsuda, M. and Tabei, Y. (2008) Efficient production of genetically engineered male sterile Arabidopsis thaliana using anther-specific promoters and genes derived from Brassica oleracea and B. rapa. Plant Cell Rep. 27(11), 1741-1754).",
                        "For the production of hybrid seed the major challenge is the restoration of the fertility of the F1 hybrid to develop seeds. While using the transgenic male sterility, it has several advantages but for the successful production of hybrid seed it is pre-requisite to have efficient restoration of the fertility of F1 hybrid. The reversible male sterility was achieved by expressing cytokinin oxidase (Huang, et al. (2007) Reversible male sterility in transgenic plants by expression of cytokinin oxidase. Patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,230,168), AtMYB103 (Li, S F, lacuone, S and Parish, R W (2007) Suppression and restoration of male fertility using a transcription factor, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 5, 297-312), glutamine synthetase (Ribarits, A, Mamun, ANK, Li, S, Resch, T, Fiers, M, Heberle-Bors, E, Liu, C and Touraev, A (2007) Combination of reversible male sterility and doubled haploid production by targeted inactivation of cytoplasmic glutamine synthetase in developing anthers and pollen. Plant Biotechnology Journal, 5, 483-494). Some male sterility and restoration systems are: Patent EP344029 and WO89/10396 described a system for producing a male sterile plant by transforming a plant with a DNA encoding barnase under the control of a tapetum-specific promoter resulted male sterility (Mariani et al., 1990) and also in other (Hird et. al., 1993; Paul et. al., 1992). PCT International Publication WO96/26283 refers that it causes problem unfavourable characteristics in rice. It is also reported that similar phenomena are observed not only in rice but in lettuce (Reymaerts et. al., 1993). Patent Application 20020166140 used mutant barnase to avoid disadvantageous effects. WO 99/04023 proposed a method of resulting male sterility of plants by the use of DNA molecule that encode avidin, Fertility can be restored by spraying the plant with a solution of biotin. Patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,230,168 described transformation of a plant cell with a nucleic acid construct encoding cytokinin oxidase causes male sterility. Fertility can be achieved by spray of cytokinin oxidase 1 inhibitor. EP2394513A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,361,929B2 describe low temperature and high temperature sensitive male sterility in gramineous plant and fertility restoration by Auxin spray."

                        "In one embodiment of the invention an expression subsystem (ES) constructed which expresses reporter gene gusA in the anther tapetum at post meiotic stage of the anther development. The expression achieved using the ES was stringent and high level, driven by tapetum-specific promoter with two level of control that makes the system highly efficient.",
                        "In another embodiment the restoration subsystem (RS) constructed which expresses regulatory protein COP1(m) in the anther tapetum driven by another tapetum-specific promoter at post-meiotic anther but prior to ES.",
                        "In yet another embodiment of the invention expression module was transformed in one plant that is used as female-parent in crossing while restoration module in other that is used as male-parent in crossing, transgenic plants were generated and cross was made between female ES and male RS transgenics to generate F1 plants. The expression of reporter protein (gusA) was found high and stringently to post-meiotic tapetum of ES transgenic while in their F1 the expression was completely abolished.",
                        "In still another embodiment expression system (ES) was used to express the candidate gene for male sterility that impairs the normal tapetum degeneration. Tapetum is the innermost wall layer of the male reproductive organ anther in flowering plants. Post meiotic PCD like degeneration of tapetum is crucial for pollen fertility. Alteration in the tapetal PCD (early/delayed) resulted in abortive pollen formation. Various genes were used to achieve male sterile transgenic plants by altering the tapetal degeneration; here in present invention we use express Arabidopsis BECLIN1/ATG6 using the expression system (ES), the system is now male sterility (MS) system. The transgenic expressing male sterility (MS) system were completely male sterile as was reported previously.",
                        "For the development of the hybrid seed it is pre-requisite to have the sufficient restoration of the fertility of the F1 hybrid. Efficient restoration of fertility of F1 hybrid is limitation in the previous systems.",
                        "In still another embodiment of the present invention transgenic plants with male sterility (MS) system which were completely male sterile, were used as female-parent in crossing while transgenic of restoration module (RS) with normal fertility were used as male-parent in crossing [MS ()xRS()], to generate F1 plants. Abolished expression of BECLIN1 transcript was found in F1 in post-meiotic anther tapetum, therefore, normal tapetal degeneration occurs which results to restored fertility of F1-hybrid.",
                        "The expression vectors claimed in this invention are the good tool to achieve reversible expression of candidate gene or more specifically BECLIN1. The restoration method of male sterility of present invention which is reliable as complete restoration was achieved, broad applicability both in intra-as well as inter-specific hybrids, toxin free as no chemical used, not sensitive to environmental factor like temperature.",

Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites at which foreign DNA sequences can be inserted in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, as well as a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Marker genes typically include genes that provide antibiotic or herbicide resistance.",
                        "A \u201creporter gene\u201d is a gene whose phenotypic expression is easy to monitor; used to study promoter activity in different tissues or developmental stages.",
                        "A \u201cpromoter\u201d is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 3\u2032 region of the anti-sense strand, also called template strand and non-coding strand). Promoters can be about 100-1000 base pairs long.",
                        "A \u201cconstitutive promoter\u201d is an unregulated promoter that allows for continual transcription of its associated gene.",
