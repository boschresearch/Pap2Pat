    "title": "A novel male sterility-fertility restoration system in plants for hybrid seed production",

    "abstract": "Hybrid seeds are used for stimulated crop production, as they harness heterosis. The achievement of complete male-sterility in the female-parent and the restored-fertility in F1-hybrids are the major bottlenecks in the commercial hybrid seed production. Here, we report a male sterility\u2013fertility restoration system by engineering the inmost nutritive anther wall layer tapetum of female and male parents. In the female parent, high\u2013level and stringent expression of Arabidopsis autophagy\u2013related gene BECLIN1 was achieved in the tapetum, which altered the tapetal degeneration program, leading to male sterility. This works on our previously demonstrated expression cassette based on functional complementation of TATA-box mutant (TGTA) promoter and TATA-binding protein mutant3 (TBPm3), with modification by conjugating Long Hypocotyle in Far-Red1 fragment (HFR1 NT131 ) with TBPm3 (HFR1 NT131 -TBPm3) to exercise regulatory control over it. In the male parent, tapetum\u2013specific Constitutive photo-morphogenesis1 (COP1) was expressed. The F1 obtained by crossing these engineered parents showed decreased BECLIN1 expression, which was further completely abolished when COP1-mutant (COP1 L105A ) was used as a male parent, leading to normal tapetal development and restored fertility. The system works on COP1-HFR1 interaction and COP1\u2013mediated degradation of TBPm3 pool (HFR1 NT131 -TBPm3). The system can be deployed for hybrid seed production in agricultural crops.",

                        "We have previously utilized TATA box binding protein mutant3 (TBPm3) and TATA-box mutation TGTA complementation system36 for high-level and stringently regulated expression in anther tapetum15. The expression through promoters with TATA-box mutated to TGTA was not driven by a native TBP protein because of its altered affinity404142, however, three amino-acid substitution mutant (Ile152 to Phe152, Val161 to Thr161, and Leu163 to Val163) of TBP (TBPm3) complement the TGTA-mutation and drive the expression from such promoters4344. The high-level expression of the TGTA-TBPm3 complementation system was achieved due to a dedicated pool of TBPm3 protein to TGTA-containing promoters153645. In this work, we seek transcriptional control over the TGTA-TBPm3 complemented system by fusing TBPm3 with the 131 amino-acid N-terminal domain of HFR1 (HFR1NT131) and specifically targeting it for degradation by COP1, thus limiting TBPm3 protein in the cell. The limited cellular availability of TBPm3 protein leads to the abolition of expression of the transgene in tapetum cells (Fig. 1a\u2013c). Tapetum-specific promoter TA29 (PTA29)46 was utilized to construct a TGTA-TBPm3 complemented system to attain high-level and stringent expression, specific to the postmeiotic tapetum as previously described15, with a modification of fusing HFR1NT131 at the N-terminus of TBPm3 to excercise further control over it (Supplementary Fig. S1-a-I). The transgenic lines of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana (NTPH) harboring this expression cassette 1370 (carrying TGTA-driven gusA gene and HFR1NT131:TBPm3 fusion in a single T-DNA cassette; Supplementary Fig. S1-a-I) were normal during growth and development with a similar range of pollen viability, germination, and seed setting when compared with NTPH plants (Supplementary Fig. S1-b and c). The anther development has been divided into seven premeiotic (\u22127 to \u22121; negative sign represents stages before the meiosis) and twelve postmeiotic stages (1 to 12) in tobacco46. The expression of gusA protein was examined in the anthers of stages 2 and 3 in 1370 transgenic lines. The gusA expression in the stage 2 anther ranges from 11.45\u2009nmoles mg\u22121min\u22121 to 47.57\u2009nmoles m\u22121min\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. S2-a), with an average expression of 22.00\u2009\u00b1\u20095.15\u2009nmoles mg\u22121min\u22121 (Fig. 2b); at stage 3, the expression ranges from 10.45\u2009nmoles mg\u22121min\u22121 to 45.65\u2009nmoles mg\u22121min\u22121(Supplementary Fig. S2-b), with average expression being 20.43\u2009\u00b1\u20095.74\u2009nmoles mg\u22121min\u22121(Fig. 2b) in the anthers of transgenic lines evaluated. Histochemical GUS staining confirmed that the expression of gusA protein was limited to tapetal cells in anthers (Fig. 2d). Expression was not detected in other plant organs such as leaves, emasculated flower buds, stems, and roots (data not shown). Taken together, our results showed that high-level and stringent expression was achieved in the postmeiotic (stages 2 and 3) tapetum, using the expression vector 1370."

                        "To evaluate whether limiting cellular protein levels of TBPm3 can abolish gusA expression, we developed transgenic tobacco lines expressing COP1 under the control of Arabidopsis tapetum-specific promoter A9 (PA9)47. In construct 1370, the desired gene (gusA in the case of 1370 cassette) was expressed under the control of the TGTA-mutated tapetum-specific promoter, and the translationally fused HFR1NT131-TBPm3 complex was under the regulation of the Pcec promoter48. HFR1NT131 is a truncated form (NT131: N-terminus 131-amino-acid fragment) of Long Hypocotyle in Far Red1 (HFR1), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) involved in the seedling response to far-red light. The NT131 amino-acid fragment loses its bioactivity but retains its interaction ability with another protein COP1 (Fig.1a\u2013c). COP1 is a repressor of light-mediated photo-morphogenesis that physically interacts with HFR1 (and HFR1NT131) and mediates its targeted degradation through the proteosome37394950. We, therefore, postulated that the fusion protein HFR1NT131:TBPm3 will also be degraded by COP1 and this was exploited to exercise control over the TGTA-TBPm3 complementation system (construct 1370). To achieve this, a regulatory expression cassette (1372) was designed, in which the Arabidopsis COP1 gene was placed under the control of the Arabidopsis tapetum-specific promoter A9 (PA9)47 (Supplementary Fig. S1-a-III). The tobacco transgenic lines of 1372 were normal during growth and development with normal flowering, pollen viability, in-vitro pollen germination and seed setting similar to those of the control (NTPH) plants (Supplementary Fig. S1b-c, and S3a-d). The relative expression of COP1 was evaluated using qRT-PCR in anther developmental stages 1 to 6. The highest expression was found in the stage 1 anthers (Supplementary Fig. S3-e). To screen the best expressing transgenic lines, relative expression of COP1 was compared using qRT-PCR in the stage 1 anthers in 19 transgenic lines. The transgenic lines 13 and 33 were selected for further studies based on their higher expression (Supplementary Fig. S4-a). To validate our hypothesis of achieving transcriptional control over the TGTA-TBPm3 system by COP1-mediated degradation of HFR1NT131-TBPm3, crossing was performed between female 1370 lines (L3 and L5; Supplementary Fig. S2-a) and male 1372 plants (T13 and T33; Supplementary Fig. S4-a), raising F1 progeny. The F1 seeds were harvested, subjected to double antibiotic selection of kanamycine and hygromycine, considering the selectable marker genes of the constructs 1370 (NPTII) and 1372 (HPTII), and further confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S5a\u2013c). The fluorimetric GUS analysis revealed a 4\u20136\u2013fold reduced GUS activity in the anthers of F1 plants during stages s2 and s3 as compared to 1370 plants (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. S2-c and d). Histochemical GUS staining of F1 plants revealed that the GUS expression was stringent to tapetal cells but diminished when compared with 1370 (Fig. 2e) Thus, COP1 imparts its control over the TGTA-TBPm3 system that is mediated by HFR1NT131- linked TBPm3 protein (HFR1NT131-TBPm3) degradation in F1 plants, albeit the expression was not completely abolished. The one reason for incomplete control of COP1 could be its light-responsive nuclear and cytoplasmic localiszation.",
                        "To develop a fertility restoration system, it is necessary to completely abolish the expression of the male sterility gene (here, BECLIN1) in the F1 hybrid. We postulate that increased nuclear localization of COP1 should cause complete degradation of HFR1NT131-TBPm3, resulting in its unavailability to form the transcriptional pre-initiation complex (PIC) on the TGTA-mutated TATA-box of the PTA29 promoter, leading to expression abolition in F1 progeny. To achieve it, COP1 was mutated to COP1L105A. The mutation in COP1 (COP1L105A) was reported to increase nuclear localization but it retained its normal functioning38. The expression cassette 1373 (Supplementary Fig. S1-a-iv) was designed to express mutated COP1 (COP1L105A) using PA9. The transgenic plants expressing COP1L105Awere found to be normal during growth, development, and fertility (Fig. 2g\u2013j, Supplementary Fig. S1a-b). The highest COP1L105A expression was found at the s1 anther development stage (Fig. 2k). Fifteen transgenic lines were compared for relative expression; lines 3 and 5 were selected for the crossing experiment based on their higher expression (Supplementary Fig. S4-b). The cross was made between female 1370 (emasculated) and male 1373 to raise F\u20191 seeds. The F\u20191 seeds were screened on double antibiotic selection medium (Kanamycin and Hygromycin) and standard PCR. The fluorimetric and histochemical GUS analysis of anthers of F\u20191 plants at developmental stages s2 and s3 showed completely abolished expression of gusA protein (Fig. 2b,f, and Supplementary Fig. S2e,f). The results indicated that the nuclear localization of COP1L105A imparts its complete control over the TGTA-TBPm3 system through HFR1NT131-mediated degradation of TBPm3."

                        "We previously demonstrated that high-level expression of Arabidopsis ATG6/BECLIN1 in the tapetum under control of the TGTA-TBPm3 complementation system leads to complete male sterility in tobacco15. To develop a male sterility\u2013fertility restoration system, we cloned Arabidopsis ATG6/BECLIN1 into the 1370 vector replacing gusA, thus developing the construct 1371 (Supplementary Fig. S1-a-ii). The tobacco transgenic lines expressing 1371 showed no morphological anomaly, with normal growth and development comparable to wild plants except male sterility (Fig. 3a,b). The flowers of 1371 transgenics showed healthy stigma and other accessory whorls, whereas pollen grains laden to the anther were very low (Fig. 3c,d). The flowers failed to self-fertilize because of the formation of non-viable pollen, which eventually dries out and drops from the floral axis (Fig. 3d arrow shows point of detachment and drying); whereas when fertilized with the viable pollen of wild plants, a normal seed setting was observed (data not shown). The results suggest that stigma receptivity and female reproductive organs of 1371 transgenics were normal, and the drop of flowers was due to the development of aborted pollen and failure in fertilization.",
                        "The relative expression of Arabidopsis BECLIN1 was compared using qRT-PCR at a different anther developmental stage of the 1371 transgenic lines; the highest expression was found in stages 2 and 3 (Fig. 3e). To understand the effect of postmeiotic, tapetum-specific, and high-level expression of BECLIN1 on the pollen development, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of developing pollens was performed. No obvious differences were found till stage 1, between 1371 transgenics and control (NTPH) as meiosis was normal and microspore tetrad was surrounded by the callose in both control (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. S6-b) and in transgenic (Fig. 3l, Supplementary Fig. S6-i) plants. At stage 2, microspores became free due to callose decomposition, the nucleus was displaced aside due to a single large vacuole and development of the orderly microspore exine structure was seen in the control (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. S6-c); whereas in 1371 transgenics the tetrad was not fully separated due to remnants of the callose deposition and deformation had started in microspores (Fig. 3m, Supplementary Fig. S6-j). The vacuole gets enlarged with demarked wall formation in stage 3 microspores in case of control (Fig. 3h, Supplementary Fig. S6-d), whereas deformation increases in 1371 transgenics (Fig. 3n, Supplementary Fig. S6-k). At stage 4, the generative cell was attached to the wall with a prominent vegetative nucleus, cytoplasm, and normal exine and intine development in the control (Fig. 3i, Supplementary Fig.S6-e); whereas in 1371 transgenics, the cytoplasm was collapsed and pollen wall deformations were visible (Fig. 3o, Supplementary Fig. S6-e). The microspore shape became nearly circular and was filled with dense cytoplasm and small vesicles; the pollen wall also differentiated into well-developed exine and intine at stages 5,6 in control pollens (Fig. 3j,k, Supplementary Fig. S6f-g); whereas in case of pollens of 1371 transgenics, the cytoplasm collapsed and severe deformity was observed in the pollen wall (Fig. 3p,q, Supplementary Fig. S6m-n).",
                        "We next examined the pollen viability, in-vitro pollen germination and seed setting in wild and 1371 transgenics. The 1371 transgenic lines showed considerably low pollen viability (Fig. 4a,b,u) with nil germination (Fig. 4m,n,u) as compared to the control (wild type). In control plants, bagging of a young inflorescence before anthesis results in normal seed setting (Fig. 4q,v), unlike in male sterile plants in which all the bulbs were seedless (Fig. 4r,v). Further, the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of stage 7 pollen of control showed normal pollen morphology (Fig. 4e,f, and Supplementary Fig. S7a-b); whereas deformed pollens were seen in the 1371 transgenic lines (Fig. 4g,h, and Supplementary Fig. S7c-d). The results obtained by the new system are in agreement with our previous finding15 that overexpression of BECLIN1 in the anther tapetum resulted in complete male sterility in the tobacco transgenic plants. In addition, the male sterile female lines are equipped with additional regulatory control over the TGTA-TBPm3 system operated through the male component."

                        "Restoration of pollen fertility in F1 progeny is a prerequisite for hybrid seed production. The male sterile 1371 transgenic female lines were crossed with the selected male lines expressing either COP1 (1372) or COP1L105A (1373) to raise F1 and F\u20191 progeny, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5). In F1 [1371(\u2640)\u2009\u00d7\u20091372(\u2642)] plants, pollen viability was recorded ~15.14% (Fig. 4c,u) as compared with ~77.71% of control; whereas in-vitro pollen germination was ~18.5% (Fig. 4o,u) in F1 as compared with ~70% in case of control plants. The pollen viability of F1 was low, but the seed setting was found to be comparable to the control plants (Fig. 4s,v). The SEM of stage 7 pollens showed a high population of aborted and deformed pollens with a few normal architecture pollens in F1 plants (Fig. 4i,j, Supplementary Fig. S7 e-f).The relative expression of BECLIN1 and COP1 was quantified in s1-s6 anther developmental stages of F1 plants. We found higher accumulation of AtBECLIN1 transcript in s1, s2, and s3 stages. The COP1 expressed at considerably high level in the s1 stage. We next compared the expression of BECLIN1 in s2 stage in F1 with that of 1371 transgenic male sterile lines and found about ~21-fold decrease in the expression (Fig. 5a,c,d). The results, thus, indicate that COP1 (1372) mediates partial restoration of fertility in F1 plants by reducing the expression of BECLIN1. In F\u20191 [1371(\u2640)\u2009\u00d7\u20091373(\u2642)] progeny, the pollen viability and pollen germination was found to be comparable to that of control plants (Fig. 4d,p,u). The SEM of stage 7 pollen showed pollen architecture similar to control pollen (Fig. 4k,l, and Supplementary Fig. S7g-h). The seed setting was normal with seed weight ~78.89\u2009mg/pod, comparable to control ~74.23\u2009mg/pod (Fig. 4t,v). The expression of BECLIN1 was completely abolished, while the expression of COP1 was found to be the highest in the s1 anther stage in F\u20191 (Fig. 5b\u2013d). The results established complete restoration of male fertility in F\u20191 plants by utilizing the principle of COP1-mediated degradation of HFR1NT131-TBPm3 and by abolishing the expression of BECLIN1."

                        "To determine the cause of pollen abortion in BECLIN1 expressing transgenics (1371), we examined cross-sections of anther from control (NTPH) and 1371 transgenic lines at different anther developmental stages46. At stage \u22121, the tapetum was well developed enclosing microspore mother cells (MMC) which were in the stage of meiotic division in the control (Fig. 6a). At stage 1, the meiotic division occurs, forming dyad and tetrad with distinct tapetum in the control (Fig. 6b). However, no obvious differences were observed in the 1371 transgenic anther in stages \u22121 and 1, when compared with the control (Fig. 6h,i). The morphological defects started surfacing at stage 2; at this stage, well-developed tapetal layer enclosing nascent-free microspores were observed in control anther (Fig. 6c), whereas in 1371 anther, tapetal cells showed abnormal growth and the entire pollen sac was filled with debris and unstructured cell matter (Fig. 6j). At stage 3, control tapetal cells shrank and microspores were clearly visible (Fig. 6d); whereas in 1371, the abnormal tapetal structure, debris, and unstructured cell matter filled the pollen sac and microspores were not clearly visible (Fig. 6k). At stage 4, the control tapetum was degenerating and only epidermis and endothecial layers were visible as surrounding filled mature pollens (Fig. 6e). Interestingly in 1371 anther, tapetal layer remained intact with empty pollens in the pollen sac (Fig. 6l). At stages 5,6, the control tapetum was completely degenerated and pollens were mature with a darkly stained dense cytoplasm (Fig. 6f,g); whereas in 1371 transgenics, the tapetum was still visible as enclosing empty aborted pollens (Fig. 6m,n). To ensure that the abnormal tapetal growth and delayed degeneration in the male sterile parent was because of the expression of BECLIN1, the anther cross-sections of the F\u20191 were observed, as we had already observed complete abolition of BECLIN1 expression in F\u20191. The cross-section of F\u20191 showed normal development of tapetum and pollen similar to the control (Fig. 6o\u2013u), confirming that the tapetal abnormality and pollen abortion in 1371 were due to the expression of BECLIN1."

                "In this study, we have developed a male sterility\u2013fertility restoration system for heterosis breeding in plants. In the female parent, tapetum-specific, high-level and postmeiotic expression of the Arabidopsis BECLIN1/ATG6 gene led to complete male sterility. The tapetum\u2013specific expression was completely abolished and male fertility was restored in the F1 hybrid.",
                "The male sterility system (construct 1371; Supplementary Fig. S1a-I) is the modification of our previously reported two component system15 based on the principle of expression restoration of a TGTA-mutated promoter by providing a complementing TBPm3, which binds specifically to the TGTA36. The system gave several-fold enhancement of expression over the native tapetum-specific promoter (Fig. 1a), in agreement with our previous report15. In this study, we included the light-regulated transcription factor HFR1 that exhibits its COP1-mediated degradation374950 to limit TBPm3 and abolish expression of the desired gene. HFR1 is a transcription factor (bHLH) consisting of 292 amino acids, of which the N-terminus 131 amino acid interacts with COP1 and the C-terminus 161 amino acid has a functional role to bind DNA and promote photomorphogenesis3949. We fused the HFR1NT131 fragment to the N-terminus of TBPm3, thus making the fusion protein HFR1NT131-TBPm3. This fusion did not affect the functionality of TBPm3, resulting in a high-level expression of the desired gene (gusA or BECLIN1) (Fig. 1a). The transgenic plants expressing gusA were normal in growth and development, and the strength and stringency of the expression system were not compromised (Fig. 2b,c\u2013f, and Supplementary Fig. S1-b and c). To ensure the transcriptional abolition of tapetum-specific expression in F1 progeny, it was crossed with the male parent expressing COP1 under the regulation of the Arabidopsis PA9 promoter47 (Fig. 1b). The expression of COP1 ensures its availability to bind with HFR1NT131 and to degrade it in the F1 tapetal cell. The degradation of TBPm3 was also achieved, as it was conjugated HFR1NT131-TBPm3 (Fig. 1c). However, COP1 facilitates only partial abolition of the TGTA-TBPm3 complementation system in F1 (Fig. 2b,c\u2013f). The COP1 protein is known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus39, and stoichiometrically insufficient nuclear concentration of COP1 might be a reason for partial expression reversion. Therefore, we made use of an alternative COP1-mutant (COP1L105A)38. The mutation retained dimerization and functional activity of the COP1 but increased its nuclear abundance. The expression of the reporter gene (gusA) was completely abolished in F\u20191 progeny when COP1L105A lines were used as a male parent, instead of native COP1 (Fig. 2b,c\u2013f). Thus, a tapetum-specific reversible expression system was established.",
                "The male sterility and fertility restoration system developed by us are generic in nature and hence can be used with other reported genes for male sterility. Thus, the female expression cassette (1371) can be used to generate the male-sterile parent by expressing any known gene reported for the male sterility such as BARNASE18 , BAX28, and so on. The major advantage with our system that there is no specific requirement of the fertility restoration gene for example BARSTAR in BARNASE1819. The male expression cassette (Construct 1373) offers restoration through abolishing transcription of the male sterility gene. We used the Arabidopsis BECLIN1/ATG615 gene to raise complete male sterile transgenic plants. Genetic engineering of male-sterility and the fertility-restoration system have emerged as tangible options for hybrid seed production. Several restoration systems have been reported to redeem male fertility by inactivating the male sterility protein1819, degrading transcripts of the male sterility gene141751 and site-specific recombination in the male sterility gene810. However, efficient restoration of fertility has been discussed as one of the limiting factors in some of the systems142151. The present system offers a system equipped with complete male sterility and fertility restoration in F1-progeny (Figs 4,1a\u2013c; proposed model) with a novel approach.",
                "The restoration of fertility of F1 hybrid is prerequisite, especially when the economic product is seed. The barnase/barstar system1819 was deployed for the commercial hybrid production but the identification of efficient restorer (barstar) line was proven to be difficult in Brassica juncea; one in 54 cross-recombination between barnase (male sterile)\u2009\u00d7\u2009barstar (restorer) was adequately restored male fertility in the F1 hybrid2123. Tapetum-specific promoter TA29 driven barstar (restorer) restore 65.6% male fertility (in terms of pollen viability), it was further improved to 78\u201390% when PA9 and chimeric system were used to express barstar (restorer)921. Barnase weakly expressed in vegetative tissue resulted yield penalty in the plants23. The other barnase based systems; the Cre/loxp-mediated site-specific recombination system10, two-component system22, and split-gene system411 claimed 100% restoration of F1 fertility, however, use of toxic gene of trans-origin limited the acceptability due to biosefty concern in some countries. Pathogenesis-related (PR) \u03b2-1,3-glucanase gene based male sterility was only partially restored by pA9-driven sense and antisense PR glucanase fragments51. The temperature-sensitive DIPTHERIA TOXIN-A (DTAts) confer conditional-male-sterility (18\u2009\u00b0C male sterility, 26\u2009\u00b0C restored fertility)32, and reversible male sterility in egg plant16 claimed complete restoration but works on ethanol inducible method which limit its practical applicability. In our system, female expression cassette (1371) expressing plants generate complete male sterility; when compared with control (pollen viability (%): 77.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 (100%), pollen germination (%): 70\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6 (100%), and seed-setting (mg/pod): 74.23\u2009\u00b1\u20095 (100%)), 10 randomly selected BECLIN1 expressing transgenic lines showed pollen viability (%): 0.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78 (~0.96%), pollen germination (%): 0.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73 (~2.3%) and nil seed setting (Fig. 4u,v). The fertility restoration of F1 progeny works on transcription abolition of male sterility gene (BECLIN1) regulated through male parent. When COP1 expressing lines (1372) were used as male parent, F1 showed ~21-fold reduction in BECLIN1 expression (Fig. 5c), which restored pollen viability (%): 15.14\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 (20%), pollen germination (%): 18.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 (26%) that is sufficient for optimal seed setting (mg/pod) 60.2\u2009\u00b1\u200915 (81%) (Fig. 4u,v). We observed further improvement in fertility restoration when COP1-mutant (COP1L105A) lines (1373) were taken as male parent, which completely abolished the expression of BECLIN1 resulting complete restoration of pollen fertility in F\u20191 with pollen viability (%): 74.58\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 (96%), pollen germination (%): 69\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6 (~97.14% ) and seed setting (mg/pod) 71.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 (97%) (Fig. 4u,v) comparable to the untransformed control plants.",
                "Maintaining the male-sterile female lines is a prerequisite for future commercial application of this technique, and the genetic design of the male-sterile female line (construct 1371, Fig. S1a-ii) provides this opportunity. Crossing the heterozygous male-sterile female parent (BECLIN1/\u2212) with its wild type (\u2212/\u2212) results in ~50% of the male-sterile progeny (1:1 ratio, (BECLIN1/\u2212) and (\u2212/\u2212)). In future approaches, linking the herbicide resistance gene in the construct 1371 (as in SeedLinkTM) will enable the selection of male-sterile female parents. However, this requires overplanting and eliminating half of the sown plants by applying herbicide to obtain pure male-sterile female parents.",
                "In conclusion, we have developed a system for tapetum-specific, high-level expression of the desired gene to achieve complete male-sterility, along with a system for transcriptional control over the expression system for fertility-restoration in the F1-hybrid. The tapetum-specific expression of the BECLIN1/ATG6 gene facilitated complete male sterility, and COP1-mediated HFR1 degradation system was used for repression of transcription of BECLIN1 followed by fertility restoration in the F1 hybrid. The proposed male sterility-fertility restoration system described here will be a valuable future contribution for exploiting hybrid vigor and commercial production of hybrid seed."
