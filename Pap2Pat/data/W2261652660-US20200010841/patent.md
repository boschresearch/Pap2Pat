# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to an expression system for high level and stringent expression of a transgene in plants and also it's abolished expression in their F1 hybrid generated. Aiming several applications, the method can also be deployed to generate complete male sterile plants using one of the several candidate genes for male sterility and successfully restoring fertility of F1 hybrid, which is requisite for hybrid development.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART

Hybrid vigor, or heterosis, refers to the phenomenon in which the progeny derived from a cross of two inbred lines outperform the parent lines. For example, hybrid crops can produce 15-50% higher yields than inbred varieties (Tester M, Langridge P. (2010) Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world. Science 327:818-22). The utilization of heterosis has produced tremendous economic benefits in worldwide crop production. More than half of the production of major crops such as maize, rice, sorghum, rapeseed, and sunflower comes from hybrid varieties (Li S, Yang D, Zhu Y. 2007. Characterization and use of male sterility in hybrid rice breeding. J. Integr. Plant Biol. 49:791-804). Thus, hybrid breeding contributes significantly to the food supply in the world.

The manifestation of heterosis are increase yield, reproductive ability, size, better quality, resistance to disease and pests, greater adaptability. Hybrid plants have become increasingly important in various commercial food crops around the world. The development of hybrid crops has been one of the major factors behind a dramatic increase in global crop yields. Such improvement is achieved through the selective and controlled breeding of two inbred parent lines, which upon crossing delivers heterosis, or ‘hybrid vigour’. This boost in performance, combining the best yield, quality and agronomic characters from each parent, is the result of hybrid breeding.

The hybrid vigor conceptualized (Zirkle C. (1952) Early ideas on inbreeding and crossbreeding, in: Gowen J. W. (Ed.), Heterosis, Iowa State College Press, Ames, pp. 1-13) while Charles Darwin (1876), who was the first scientist to examine the phenomenon in a systematic manner (Darwin C. (1876) The effects of cross and self fertilization in the vegetable kingdom, Murray, London), W. J. Beal in maize (Beal W. J. (1880) Indian corn, Rept Michigan State Board. Agr. 19, 279-289.), Shull in plant breeding (Shull G. H. (1952) Beginnings of the heterosis concept, in: Gowen J. W. (Ed.), Heterosis, Iowa State College Press, Ames, pp. 14-48) observed. Corn was the first hybrid seed crop to be marketed extensively, and it is still the most important economic crop grown in the U.S. The most successful breeding efforts of 20th century are production of hybrid varieties of maize in US (six-fold increase between 1930-to-1990), cotton in India and rice in China.

Producing hybrid seeds of self-pollinating plants requires emasculation; the removal of functional pollen grains to prevent self-pollination. Before the mid-twentieth century, emasculation in hybrid seed production involved manual labour, machines, or chemical treatments and thus was costly, inefficient, and even damaging to the environment.

Another method is the induction of male sterility. Male sterility refers to the failure to produce dehiscent anthers, functional pollen, and viable male gametes. Male sterility was first observed by the German botanist Joseph Gottlieb K′olreuter in (1763), male sterility has been reported in more than 610 plant species (Kaul MLH. 1988. Male Sterility in Higher Plants. New York: Springer-Verlag). The use of male sterility (MS) reduces the cost of hybrid seed by eliminating the process of emasculation, also has several advantage over conventional breeding methods. There are three main types of male sterility observed in nature. All three types of male sterility are used in commercial breeding programs to ensure cross-pollination to produce hybrid seeds in different crops; a) Genetic male sterility (GMS), a) Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and c) Cytoplasmic genetic male sterility (CGMS).

In genetic male sterility (GMS), pollen sterility is caused by nuclear gene alone. The use of GSM is limited as, (i) GMS is less stable. Sometimes, sterile plants become fertile under low temperature conditions. (ii) In GMS, the lines segregate into male sterile and fertile plants in 1:1 ratio. (iii) Conversion of a genotype into GMS needs selfing after each backcross to isolate recessive genes and hence more number of generations is required. (iv) It requires more area as 50% of the population is fertile. (v) The quantity of seed produced is less. (vi) There is possibility of admixture if fertile plants are not properly rogued out (Singh Suman Bala, Singh Phundan, Mayee C D (2012) MALE STERILITY IN COTTON. CICR technical bulletin no: 24). For the production of the hybrid seed, complete restoration of fertility is required which is constrain in using GMS, also broader crop applicability is also a limitation, although, environment-sensitive GMS (EGMS) systems are also reported in some crops.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), which is caused by mitochondrial genes with coupled nuclear genes, manifestation of male sterility in these may be both entirely controlled by cytoplamsic factors (cytoplasmic) or by the interaction between cytoplasmic and nuclear factors. They follow cytoplasmic inheritance (non-mendelian inheritance). Here the sterility is transmitted only through the female and all progeny will be sterile. This is applicable to those crops where the economic product is other than seed (vegetative part). It lack restoration of F1, therefore a separate parent (maintainer line) is required for the propagation.

When nuclear genes for fertility restoration (Rf) are available for CMS system in any crop, it is called as cytoplasmic genetic male sterility (CGMS). This type of male sterility has provision for restoration of fertility, which is not possible in cytoplasmic male sterility. The fertility is restored by the Rf gene (s) present in the nucleus. Thus, the combination of both nuclear genes and cytoplasmic factors determines the fertility or sterility in such plants. The use of this system has limitations like, a) In CGMS, only limited number of crosses can be made due to availability of limited number of restorers. b) CMS is solely controlled by cytoplasmic genes and hence it may have some adverse effect on other characters. c) It is not possible to breed a variety from CMS line.

The use of genetic engineering in inducing male sterility is called transgenic male sterility. The first transgenic system was described by Mariani, 1990 (Mariani C., Beuckleer D, Truettner J, Leemans J and Goldberg R B (1990) Nature, 347, 737-741). The male gametophytic (microspore) or sporophytic (microspore mother cell (MMC), tapetum, middle layer, stomium cell) tissue were targeted which ablation resulted male sterility. Of the said tissue male sporophytic tissue tapetum ablation and impaired degeneration was targeted by several worker to achieve male sterility. Tapetum is innermost wall layer of male reproductive organ anther. Tapetum synthesise pollen wall material, enzymes, nutrients, secondary metabolites etc. and deliver to the developing microspores. When pollen tetrad form as result of meiosis in MMC the tetrad is surrounded in callose matrix, tapetum releases calase enzyme which is degrade callose and microspores releases from callose matrix. Post meiotic tapetum undergo PCD like degeneration to release nutrients, callase enzyme, pollen wall material which are important for pollen viability. It is reported that alteration in the tapetal PCD either early or delayed resulted pollen abortion and male sterility.

The genes that are used to generate male sterile plants by interfering tapetal degeneration are: BARNASE (RNase) (Mariani et al., 1990; Block and Debrouwer 1993; Roberts et al., 1995; Zhan et al., 1996; Block et al., 1997; Jagannath et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2006; Roque et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2008; Liu and Liu, 2008; Garcia-Sogo et al., 2010), RNase T-I (Mariani et al., 1990; Denis et al., 1993), Mammalian uncoupling protein (George et al., 1990), Diptheria toxin A-chain (Koltunow et al., 1990; Thorsness et al., 1993; Twell, 1995; Lee et al, 2003; Liu and Liu, 2008; Guerineau et al., 2003), BAX (Kawanabe, T., Ariizumi, T., Kawai-Yamada, M., Uchimiya, H. and Toriyama, K. (2006) Abolition of the tapetum suicide program ruins microsporogenesis. Plant Cell Physiol. 47, 784-787), AtBECLIN1 (Sudhir Pratap Singh, Tripti Pandey, Rakesh Srivastav, Praveen C. Verma, Praduman K. Singh, Rakesh Tuli and Samir V. Sawant (2010) BECLIN 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana under the generic control of regulated expression systems, a strategy for developing male sterile plants. Plant Biotech. J. 8, 1005-1022).

Tapetum specific expression of melon ethylene receptor genes (ETR1/H69A and ERS1/H70A) delays tapetum generation followed by male sterility (Takada, K., Ishimaru, K., Minamisawa, K., Kamada, H. and Ezura, H (2005a) Expression of a mutated melon ethylene receptor gene Cm-ETR1/H69A affects stamen development in Nicotiana tabacum. Plant Sci. 169, 935-942). An apoptotic protein inhibitor was identified in Arabidopsis, Bax Inhibitor-1. Kawanabe et al. (2006) showed that expression of Arabidopsis Bax Inhibitor-1 (AtBI-1) in tapetum inhibited its degeneration, by blocking cell death pathway, and subsequently resulted pollen abortion (Kawanabe, T., Ariizumi, T., Kawai-Yamada, M., Uchimiya, H. and Toriyama, K. (2006) Abolition of the Tapetum Suicide Program Ruins Microsporogenesis. Plant Cell Physiol. 47(6), 784-787). Cysteine proteases from Brassica, BoCysP1 and BoCP3, have been identified as candidate genes for male sterility. These proteins found to inhibit programmed cell death of tapetum (Konagaya, K., Ando, S., Kamachi, S., Tsuda, M. and Tabei, Y. (2008) Efficient production of genetically engineered male sterile Arabidopsis thaliana using anther-specific promoters and genes derived from Brassica oleracea and B. rapa. Plant Cell Rep. 27(11), 1741-1754).

For the production of hybrid seed the major challenge is the restoration of the fertility of the F1 hybrid to develop seeds. While using the transgenic male sterility, it has several advantages but for the successful production of hybrid seed it is pre-requisite to have efficient restoration of the fertility of F1 hybrid. The reversible male sterility was achieved by expressing cytokinin oxidase (Huang, et al. (2007) Reversible male sterility in transgenic plants by expression of cytokinin oxidase. Patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,230,168), AtMYB103 (Li, S F, lacuone, S and Parish, R W (2007) Suppression and restoration of male fertility using a transcription factor, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 5, 297-312), glutamine synthetase (Ribarits, A, Mamun, ANK, Li, S, Resch, T, Fiers, M, Heberle-Bors, E, Liu, C and Touraev, A (2007) Combination of reversible male sterility and doubled haploid production by targeted inactivation of cytoplasmic glutamine synthetase in developing anthers and pollen. Plant Biotechnology Journal, 5, 483-494). Some male sterility and restoration systems are: Patent EP344029 and WO89/10396 described a system for producing a male sterile plant by transforming a plant with a DNA encoding barnase under the control of a tapetum-specific promoter resulted male sterility (Mariani et al., 1990) and also in other (Hird et. al., 1993; Paul et. al., 1992). PCT International Publication WO96/26283 refers that it causes problem unfavourable characteristics in rice. It is also reported that similar phenomena are observed not only in rice but in lettuce (Reymaerts et. al., 1993). Patent Application 20020166140 used mutant barnase to avoid disadvantageous effects. WO 99/04023 proposed a method of resulting male sterility of plants by the use of DNA molecule that encode avidin, Fertility can be restored by spraying the plant with a solution of biotin. Patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,230,168 described transformation of a plant cell with a nucleic acid construct encoding cytokinin oxidase causes male sterility. Fertility can be achieved by spray of cytokinin oxidase 1 inhibitor. EP2394513A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,361,929B2 describe low temperature and high temperature sensitive male sterility in gramineous plant and fertility restoration by Auxin spray.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Those skilled in the art will be aware that the present disclosure is subject to variations and modifications other than those specifically described. It is to be understood that the present disclosure includes all such variations and modifications. The disclosure also includes all such steps, features, compositions and compounds referred to or indicated in this specification, individually or collectively, and any and all combinations of any or more of such steps or features.

In one embodiment of the invention an expression subsystem (ES) constructed which expresses reporter gene gusA in the anther tapetum at post meiotic stage of the anther development. The expression achieved using the ES was stringent and high level, driven by tapetum-specific promoter with two level of control that makes the system highly efficient.

In another embodiment the restoration subsystem (RS) constructed which expresses regulatory protein COP1(m) in the anther tapetum driven by another tapetum-specific promoter at post-meiotic anther but prior to ES.

In yet another embodiment of the invention expression module was transformed in one plant that is used as female-parent in crossing while restoration module in other that is used as male-parent in crossing, transgenic plants were generated and cross was made between female ES and male RS transgenics to generate F1 plants. The expression of reporter protein (gusA) was found high and stringently to post-meiotic tapetum of ES transgenic while in their F1 the expression was completely abolished.

In still another embodiment expression system (ES) was used to express the candidate gene for male sterility that impairs the normal tapetum degeneration. Tapetum is the innermost wall layer of the male reproductive organ anther in flowering plants. Post meiotic PCD like degeneration of tapetum is crucial for pollen fertility. Alteration in the tapetal PCD (early/delayed) resulted in abortive pollen formation. Various genes were used to achieve male sterile transgenic plants by altering the tapetal degeneration; here in present invention we use express Arabidopsis BECLIN1/ATG6 using the expression system (ES), the system is now male sterility (MS) system. The transgenic expressing male sterility (MS) system were completely male sterile as was reported previously.

For the development of the hybrid seed it is pre-requisite to have the sufficient restoration of the fertility of the F1 hybrid. Efficient restoration of fertility of F1 hybrid is limitation in the previous systems.

In still another embodiment of the present invention transgenic plants with male sterility (MS) system which were completely male sterile, were used as female-parent in crossing while transgenic of restoration module (RS) with normal fertility were used as male-parent in crossing [MS ()xRS()], to generate F1 plants. Abolished expression of BECLIN1 transcript was found in F1 in post-meiotic anther tapetum, therefore, normal tapetal degeneration occurs which results to restored fertility of F1-hybrid.

The expression vectors claimed in this invention are the good tool to achieve reversible expression of candidate gene or more specifically BECLIN1. The restoration method of male sterility of present invention which is reliable as complete restoration was achieved, broad applicability both in intra-as well as inter-specific hybrids, toxin free as no chemical used, not sensitive to environmental factor like temperature.

In the present invention definitions of the terms are, A “cloning vector” is a DNA molecule, such as a plasmid, cosmid, or bacteriophage that has the capability of replicating autonomously in a host cell. Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites at which foreign DNA sequences can be inserted in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, as well as a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Marker genes typically include genes that provide antibiotic or herbicide resistance.

A “reporter gene” is a gene whose phenotypic expression is easy to monitor; used to study promoter activity in different tissues or developmental stages.

A “promoter” is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 3′ region of the anti-sense strand, also called template strand and non-coding strand). Promoters can be about 100-1000 base pairs long.

A “constitutive promoter” is an unregulated promoter that allows for continual transcription of its associated gene.

A “tapetum-specific promoter” is a regulated promoter that allows expression of the gene only to the tapetum tissue of the anther.

The term “expression” refers to the biosynthesis of a gene product. For example, in the case of a structural gene, expression involves transcription of the structural gene into mRNA and the translation of mRNA into one or more polypeptides.

An “expression cassette” is a DNA molecule comprising a gene that is expressed in a host cell and a promoter, driving its expression. Typically, gene expression is placed under the control of certain tissue-specific regulatory elements.

A “transcription factor” is a protein that binds to a cis-regulatory element (eg. an enhancer, a TATA box) and thereby, directly or indirectly, affects the initiation of transcription.

A “recombinant vector” is a vector in which a foreign DNA has been inserted.

An “expression vector” is a vector in which an expression cassette has been genetically engineered.

A “binary vector” is able to replicate in both E. coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It typically contains a foreign DNA in place of T-DNA, the left and right T-DNA borders, marker for selection and maintenance in both E. coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a selectable marker for plants. This plasmid is said to be disarmed since its tumor-inducing genes located in the T-DNA have been removed.

A “suitable promoter” includes a tissue-specific or cell-specific promoter that controls gene expression in those particular cells of a particular tissue. An “anther-specific promoter” is a DNA sequence that directs a higher level of transcription of an associated gene in anther tissue than in some or all other tissues of a plant. In present invention suitable promoter directs expression only in cells that are critical for the formation or function of pollen, including tapetum cells, pollen mother cells, and early microspores.

The program cell death (PCD)/apoptosis is a genetically directed process of cell self-destruction that is marked by the fragmentation of nuclear DNA, is activated either by the presence of a stimulus or removal of a suppressing agent or stimulus, and is a normal physiological process eliminating DNA-damaged, superfluous, or unwanted cells called also programmed cell death.

The “Autophagy” is a self-degradative process that is important for balancing sources of energy at critical times in development and in response to nutrient stress. Autophagy also plays a housekeeping role in removing misfolded or aggregated proteins, clearing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, as well as eliminating intracellular pathogens.

The “explants” is living tissue transferred from an organism to an artificial medium for culture. “Photo-morphogenesis” is light-mediated development of plants.

The present invention relates to the development of a regulated expression module where tapetum-specific post-meiotic expression of a candidate gene can be achieved and their expression can abolished completely in the F1 when crossed with transgenic containing second module. The invention provides a method which facilitates the use of male sterility related gene expression to achieve male-sterile plants and also restoration of fertility of F1 hybrid which is pre-requisite for development of hybrid seed.

In one embodiment of the invention three expression vectors were constructed. The first vector construct is expression system (ES) consist of two transcription units (TUs); expression component and regulatory component (FIG. 1A). In first transcription unit (expression component) comprising a reporter gene which may be selected from gusA, GFP, YFP etc. under the transcriptional control of tapetum-specific promoter with mutated TATA-box to TGTA and suitable transcription termination signal including a polyadenylation signal.

The individual component of first transcriptional unit (TUs) are discussed: (a) TA29(TGTA); a tapetum-specific promoter from tobacco. TGTATATG mutation was introduced in the TATATATG box. This site directed mutagenesis makes it specific to TBPm3. It do not recognize native TATA-binding protein (TBP) but when tree amino acid replacement was made to form TBPm3, mutated TATA-box will recognize and higher expression will be achieved due to increased pool of TBPm3 dedicated to expression of TA29(TGTA) tagged transcript. (TA29 promoter used from Nicotiana tabacum, TBPm3 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. Nicotiana tabacum cv Petite Havana SR1, of LEHLE Seeds, United State. Arabidopsis genotype of Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre (ABRC). (b) gusA; reporter gene encode β-glucuronidase which can be measured in terms of quantity as well as qualitative (tissue specificity). (Of pBI101 vector). (c) nosT; transcriptional terminator sequence including polyadenylation signal (of pBI101 vector).

The second transcriptional unit (TU) of ES (regulatory component) which regulates first TUs comprises of fusion polypeptide of the HFR1n-131-TBPm3 under the control of constitutive promoter and fused to a suitable transcription termination signal including a polyadenylation signal. The individual component of second transcriptional unit (TUs) are discussed: (a) Pcec; an artificial constitutive promoter (designed in our laboratory at CSIR-NBRI, Lucknow). (b) HFR1n-131; Long hypocotyls in far red, a transcription factor of light regulated promoter which plays role in photo-morphogenesis. Only N-terminus fragment of 131 amino acids was taken which do not have any functional domain. It contain only interacting domain with repressor of light signaling i.e. COP1 (Constitutive photomorphogenic1). Therefore, expressions of HFR1n-131 do not have any effect on the normal development on the plant (Yang J, Lin R, Sullivan J, Hoecker U, Liu B, Xu L, Deng X W, Wang H. (2005) Light regulates COP1-mediated degradation of HFR1, a transcription factor essential for light signaling in Arabidopsis Plant Cell, 17(3):804-21.). (HFR1n-131 gene used from Arabidopsis thaliana. (c) TBPm3; TATA binding protein (TBP) with three amino acid substitutions: Ile152 to Phe152, Val161 to Thr161, and Leu163 to Val63. The three amino acid substitutions resulted in the change in protein conformation that makes it specific to mutated TATA box recognition. (of Arabidopsis thaliana). (d) nosT; transcriptional terminator sequence including a polyadenylation signal.

The sequence of ES construct is tapetum-specific promoter: reporter gene:transcriptional terminator:constitutive promoter: transcription factor fragment with ability to bind to restorer protein-TATA binding protein:transcriptional terminator, More specifically (TA29(TGTA):gusA:Tnos::Pcec:HFR1n-131-TBPm3:Tnos) (FIG. 1A).

The second vector construct is male sterility (MS) module (FIG. 1B). The expression system similar to the first module except the reporter gene (gusA) is replaced by one of the several gene that impairs the tapetal degeneration and cause male sterility (described in prior art). In present invention Arabidopsis BECLIN1 gene (BECLIN1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana) which is an autophagy related gene, when expressed in tapetum resulted male sterility. (Sudhir Pratap Singh, Tripti Pandey, Rakesh Srivastav, Praveen C. Verma, Praduman K. Singh, Rakesh Tuli and Samir V. Sawant (2010) BECLIN 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana under the generic control of regulated expression systems, a strategy for developing male sterile plants. Plant Biotech. J. 8, 1005-1022).

The third vector construct is restoration (RS) module (Figure. IC) consist of the single transcription unit where a protein that regulates the expression of first/second vector is expressed under the control of another tapetum-specific promoter with a suitable transcription termination signal including a polyadenylation signal. The RS module comprises: (a) A9; tapetum-specific promoter isolated from Arabidopsis. It express gene in the tapetum in postmeiotic anther stage of development. (A9 promoter from Arabidopsis thaliana). (b) COP1L105A; Constitutive photomorphogenic1 (COP1) is a repressor of photo-morphogenesis. It functions as an essential negative regulator of light mediated plant development. It targets photo-morphogenesis promoting transcription factors like HYH, HY5, and HFR1 etc. for ubiquitylation and degradation in the dark and promote skoto-morphogenesis. The mutation in L105A in the nuclear exclusion sequence resulted increased nuclear localization while retaining functionality (Subramanian, C, Kim, D H, Lyssenko, N N, Xu, X, Johnson, C H and Arnim, AGV (2004) The Arabidopsis repressor of light signaling, COP1, is regulated by nuclear exclusion; mutational analysis by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. PNAS, 101, 6798-6802). (COP1L105A gene from Arabidopsis thaliana). (c) nosT; transcriptional terminator sequence including a polyadenylation signal.

Another embodiment is to develop method where reversible expression of said gene can be achieved. The strategy underlying to achieve male sterile plant and restoring the fertility of F1 hybrid through transcription regulation and light signaling mechanism (FIG. 2A) is, MS construct will be transformed in parent which will be taken as female parent (male sterile) in hybrid breeding while RS construct will be transformed in the parent which will be taken as male parent (male fertile).The cross is made MS (female)xRS (male) to raise the F1.

The ms module (FIG. 2B) is based on TGTA-TBPm3 complementation principle based two component system (Chaturvedi, C P, Lodhi, N, Ansari S A, Tiwari S, Srivastav R, Sawant S V, Tuli, R (2007) Mutated TATA-box/TATA binding protein complementation system for regulated transgene expression in tobacco. The Plant Journal 50, 917-925); it contains two transcriptional units (TUs), expression component and regulatory component. In first TU (expression component), AtBECLIN1 gene expressed using tobacco tapetum-specific promoter TA29 with mutated TATA-box to TGTA. The TA29(TGTA) express AtBECLIN1 which is regulated by second TU (regulatory system). The regulatory system express fusion protein; only 311 amino acid N-terminus fragment of Long hypocotyls in Far-red (HFR1) SEQ ID-5, (a b-HLH transcription factor of light regulated promoters of Arabidopsis) and mutated version of TATA-binding protein TBPm3. HFR1n-131aa-TBPm3 fusion protein express which recognize the TGTA of TA29 promoter and form pre-initiation complex (PIC). TBPm3 pool is available only to TGTA, therefore, high-level of AtBECLIN1 expression occurs in anther tapetum. Their expression will confer the complete male sterility.

Restoration (rs) module developed by expressing the Arabidopsis COP1 (constitutive photomorphogenic 1) in the anther tapetum using Arabidopsis tapetum-specific promoter A9. COP1 is repressor of Photomorphogenic development; it possesses E3 ligase activity toward a group of photo-morphogenesis promoting factors, including HFR1 and is responsible for their targeted degradation. Mutation in COP1L105A (SEQ ID-7) resulted in increased nuclear localization. A9 promoter confers the COP1L105A expression in the anther tapetum. Their expression do not alter the natural tapetal degeneration mechanism, hence, transgenic expressing COP1L105A are male fertile and are used as male-parent in hybrid development.

F1-hybrids were developed by crossing ms module expressing transgenic (female-parent) and restorer module expressing transgenic (male-parent) (Figure. 2D). In them, both module express in same tapetal cell. COP1L105A protein form which localized in the nucleus where it physically interact with HFR1n-131aa fragment of fusion protein HFR1n-131aa-TBPm3 and resulted in the degradation of complete protein. TBPm3 will not available to form PIC, this results no expression of AtBECLIN1, normal tapetal degeneration and hence fertility of F1 hybrid will be restored.

Another embodiment Agrobacterium (of DNA cloning service (DCS), Germany) mediated transformation method comprises: (a) Constructing a recombinant construct; ES and MS expression systems were cloned in a binary vector pBI101 pBI101, and pBI121 (of Clontech, USA) separately in which nptII gene is used to express by constitutive promoter (CamV35S) which give resistance to kanamycine. The RS expression system cloned in binary vector where hptII gene expressed by weak constitutive promoter (pNOS) to avoid bidirectional expression, it gives resistance to hygromycine; (b) mobilizing the recombinant constructs of step (a) into Agrobacterium strain to produce recombinant Agrobacterium strains; (c) obtaining a suitable explant from the plant; (d) cultivating the explant with the recombinant Agrobacterium strain of step (b) to produce transformed plant cells; (e) culturing the transformed plant cells to produce transformed plants; (f) obtaining transformed plants.

The present invention relates to monocotyledonous or a dicotyledonous plant transformation, wherein the plant is selected from a group consisting of tobacco, cotton, rice, wheat, corn, potato, tomato, oilseed rape, alfalfa, sunflower, onion, clover, soyabean, pea.

One embodiment provides Agrobacterium strain selected from a group consisting of LBA4404, EHA 101 and EHA 105.

Another embodiment provides explant selected from a group consisting of leaf, stem, root, hypocotyl and embryo.

Yet another embodiment provides a transformed plant cell comprising the recombinant construct.

Still another embodiment provides a transgenic plant transformed with the recombinant constructs.

Another embodiment provides the transgenic plant selected from a group consisting of tobacco, cotton, rice, brassica, potato, tomato, oilseed rape, alfalfa, sunflower, onion, clover, soyabean, pea.

Yet another embodiment provides a plant, a plant part, a seed, a plant cell and a progeny thereof, wherein the plant, plant part, seed, plant cell, or progeny thereof comprises the recombinant construct.

The present invention relates to a recombinant construct (FIG. 1A) for transforming plants to achieve tapetum-specific expression. Further, when another plant transformed with other recombinant construct (FIG. 1C) pollens used to cross the first one to raise F1, the expression of said gene will be completely abolished. The said hypothesis was tested in tobacco by expressing gusA gene. Fluorometric GUS assay of post-meiotic anther of transgenic showing elevated expression of reporter gene, while F1 showing abolished expression (FIG. 3-i). When histochemical GUS staining was performed to localize the expressed gene, GUS staining localized in tapetum tissue of post-meiotic anther and no staining was appear in other plant tissue also no staining was appear in the F1 tapetum of the same anther stage (FIG. 3-ii).

Tapetum is the innermost wall layer of the male reproductive organ anther in flowering plants. Post meiotic PCD like degeneration of tapetum is crucial for pollen fertility. Tapetum degeneration at post-meiotic stage of pollen development is requires as it releases nutrients to developing microspores, pollen wall materials, callase to separate the tetrad and other enzymes, flavenoids, alkenes, proteins etc. Alteration in the tapetal PCD (early/delayed) resulted in abortive pollen formation. Various genes were expressed to disrupt normal tapetal degeneration and male sterility was achieves; Barnase, RNase T-I, Mammalian uncoupling protein, Diphtheria toxin A-chain, Ribosome Inactivating Protein, BAX, Arabidopsis Bax inhibitor-1, AtBECLIN1 (discussed in prior art). The said method of the tapetum-specific expression of any gene that interferes in the normal tapetal degeneration mechanism will resulted in the male sterility. The above said vector construct are designed for tapetum-specific expression using tapetum-specific promoter but two level of stringency and higher level of expression make it better as it will be helpful in generating complete male sterile plants. Here we use AtBECLIN1 gene which is a plant autophagy related gene without cytotoxic role.

An embodiment of the present invention relates to a recombinant construct (FIG. 1B) expressing plant gene BECLIN1 in tapetum of post-meiotic anther (FIG. 6A). The expression vector includes restoration factor HFR1 which inclusion do not affect their expression. Their expression interfere normal tapetal degeneration causes pollen abortion and generates male sterile plant as was reported previously (FIG. 4B). These plants fail to produce viable pollen (FIG. 5A) and are not able to facilitate normal seed setting (FIG. 6B).

For the production of hybrid seeds which is aim of hybrid breeding, male sterility based hybrids have several advantages and are cheaper as it replace the manual emasculation process. When the commercial product is hybrid seed, there is need to restore the fertility of F1 hybrid. In present condition effective restoration of F1 fertility is limitation. Here our said method provides effective restoration of F1 hybrid with broad applicability. The method is advanced as the control of the male sterility gene is at transcription level.

Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a recombinant construct (FIG. 1C) wherein said regulatory sequence (COP1L105A) is expressed using suitable promoter i.e. tapetum specific promoter (A9) having polynucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 7. it express COP1L105A) post-meiotic but prior to the BECLIN1 (FIG. 6-ii). The transgenic of the said are fertile (FIG. 4B, 5A) and showing normal seed settings (FIG. 4B, 5B) . . . .

Yet another embodiment of the present invention relates to the crossing of the ms transgenic () and rs transgenic () to raise the F1 plants.

Still another embodiment is to analyses F1 plants, they are showing restored fertility as pollen viability and pollen germination is similar to control plant (FIG. 4B, 5A) and normal seed setting (FIG. 4B, 5B). When expression of BECLIN1 was checked in different anther developmental stages, it was found that their expression was abolished (FIG. 6-iii and 6-iv).

Hybrid crops are made to exploit heterosis or hybrid vigor. Heterosis is exhibited when two heterotic parents P1 () and P2 () will cross to make F1. The above said method can be established in such that P1 parents will be transformed with MS vector and P2 with RS vector. P1 will be complete male sterile while P2 will show normal fertility. When both crossed [P1 ()xP2 ()], II rose with restored fertility. The method can be established in previously defined heterotic parents.

The resultant pBI101 carrying the expression cassette was into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 following the modified protocol (Cangelosi et al., 1991).

**Transformation of Tobacco Plants**

As described in Example 4, recombinant Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the expression cassette was used for transformation of Nicotina tabacum cv. Petit Havana by protocol as described by Horsch et al., in 1985.

In short a single isolated colony of A. tumefaciens LBA 4404 harboring binary vector with above described expression cassettes was inoculated in YEP medium containing antibiotics streptomycin (250 μg/ml) rifampicin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and grown (200 rpm, overnight, 28° C.). Fifty micro liters of the overnight culture was diluted to 100 ml in YEP medium and grown till OD600 reached to 0.8. Cells were recovered by centrifugation in SS34 rotor (5,000 rpm, 10 min, 4° C.). The pellet was suspended in co-cultivation medium (MS salts, 2% glucose, 10 mM MES and 100 mM acetosyrengone, pH 5.6) to OD600 0.6. Tobacco leaf discs were co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens for two days in dark. After co-cultivation, the leaf discs were transferred to regeneration medium supplemented with cefotaxime (250 μg/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). The culture was incubated at 25 with 16 hrs light and 8 hrs dark cycle for a period of four weeks. After this, the transgenic shoots were harvested and transferred to rooting medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml). After incubation for 2-4 weeks, the putative transgenic plantlets were transferred to Hoagland solution for acclimatization and then transferred to vermiculite for hardening for three weeks. The plants were transferred from vermiculite to soil in glasshouse. Independent transgenic lines were developed for the expression cassette (chimeric gene fusion).

The same method was deployed for all three constructs.

**Analysis of Transgenic Lines for Transgene Integration**

Genomic DNA of the transgenic lines and control plant was isolated by CTAB method of DNA extraction.

Analysis of ms transgenics; The genomic DNA was used as template to amplify a fragment of 2.5 kb comprising TA29 promoter and plant Beclin 1 gene by using one set of primers, 5′cgc gga teec aga tct teec aac att tact cc aag gg 3′ and 5′cgt ega get cct aag ttt ttt tac atg aag get ta 3′.

**Analysis of Expression Module (Es) Transgenic**

Transgenic of expression module (TA29 (TGTA)-gusA-Tnos-Pcec-HFR1n-131-TBPm3-Tnos) was analyzing at maturity.

Fluorometric GUS assay; The anthers of developmental stage 3 and stage 4 were collected and florimetric GUS assay was performed. The anthers of one flower bud (16-20 mg) were crushed in liquid nitrogen, suspended in 0.180 ml of GUS extraction buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4 pH-7.0, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SLS, 0.1% Triton X-100) and transferred to 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. Whole procedure here after was done at 4° C. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugating the samples at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant were transferred into fresh tubes. 9 μl of extract was mixed with 1 μl of 10×GUS assay buffer (MUG suspended in GUS extraction buffer) in fresh tubes and mixed by pipeting. The tubes were covered to protect from light and incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. After the incubation period the reaction was stopped by adding 90 μl of 0.2 M sodium carbonate solution. The tubes were mixed properly by vortexing for few seconds. Relative fluorescence of MU was recorded using Perkin Elmer Spectrofluorometer with an excitation at 365 nm and emission at 455 nm. Total soluble protein in anther extract was quantified, using the Bio-Rad dye.

Histochemical GUS analysis; The anther of developmental stage 3 was collected and histochemical GUS analysis was performed. Whole anthers of stage 3 were placed in a 50 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylglucuronide (X-Gluc) solution (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH7, 0.2% Triton X100, 3 mM potassium ferricyanide, 3 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 20% methanol) and vacuum infiltrated at 200 mm Hg for 5 minute, three times with the interval of 15 minutes. Then incubate for overnight. Stained anthers were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde Fixative at 4° C. Fixed anthers were dehydrated in ethanol series 50%, 70%, 85%, 95% and 100% for 1 h each. Infiltration was done in 2:1, 1:1 and 1:0 of (ethanol: infiltration solution) for 1 h each and embedded in resin (JB-4 Embedding Kit, Polysciences Inc. Eppelheim, Germany). 12-μM thick sections were cut using Leica microtome and pictures were captured using Leica microscope.

Crossing; ES transgenic were crossed with RS (ES(♀)xRS(♂)). The resultant F1 seeds were collected and sown on kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Germinated seedlings were transferred on the soil to raise F1 plants.

F1 analysis; The anther of stage 3 and stage 4 were collected and histochemical and fluoremertric gus assay was performed as described above. Leaf, root, bud and stem were also taken for the analysis to check the specificity of the expression to anther tapetum.

**Analysis of Transgenic (MS) for Male Sterility and Restored Fertility of F1 Hybrid**

The transgenic plants grew well to visible maturity and showed normal flowering. Expression of the autophagy gene in anthers did not lead any morphological abnormalities except nonviable pollens and defected seed setting.

Pollen viability assay was performed using double stain Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propedium iodide (PI). 2 mg/ml FDA solution was made in acetone in darkness. 10% sucrose solution was added drop by drop until FDA solution turn milky. PI of 1 mg/ml in final volume was added in the working FDA. Pollen from Control (NTPH), 1370 transgenic lines and F1 lines (1370(♀)x1373(♂)) were incubated in for 5 min. followed by 3 washes in PBS. Pollens were collected by centrifuge and mounted on slowfade antifade (invitrogen) and observed under confocal microscope (LSM510META, CarlZeiss) using FDA (excitation 495 emission 519) and PI (excitation 536 emission 617). Viable pollen stained with FDA while aborted pollen was stained with PI. % of pollen viability was calculated by counting FDA/PI stained pollen in unit area (n=10).

Pollen germination assay; In vitro pollen germination test was performed by using a liquid medium consisting of 10% Sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml Boric acid, 0.3 mg/ml Calcium nitrate, 0.2 mg/ml Magnesium sulphate, 0.1 mg/ml Potassium nitrate (Kwack, 1964). A droplet of pollen germination medium was deposited over pollen sample on a slide. The slide was placed in a petriplate over folded foil in such a position that the droplet along with pollen should hang. A wet filter paper was placed at the base of the petriplate to maintain some humidity around the germinating pollen. Data of pollen germination was recorded after 6 hours.

Seed setting was observed after bagging the inflorescence before anthesis of flowers.

**Real Time PCR Analysis**

Different developmental stages (S1-S6) of anther of MS, RS and F1 plants were taken and Total RNA was isolated by Plant spectrum Total RNA isolation kit (Sigma-aldrich). The quality of RNA was checked by visualizing the rRNA in ethedium bromide-coloured agarose gel under UV light. Two micrograms of total RNA was used in cDNA preparation using SuperScript™ Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR of COP1 was performed by using primer COP1RT_F 5′AAGCGGCGGTTCTGAGATT3′ COP1RT_R 5′ACCACAAGCCGTGAGGAAAG3′ and BECLIN1 by using AtBECLIN 1 forward 5′AGGGCATTCCTCCACGTC3′ and reverse primer 5′ AAGAGACA GATTGTGAGAACCACCA 3′ on ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystem, Foster city, CA, USA, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com). The AtBECLIN1 transcript was normalized with respect to ubiquitin transcript as internal control. For ubiquitin, primers (UbiF) 5′CCACGGAGACGGAGGACAA3′ and (UbiR) 5′GAAGCA GCTCGAGGATGGAA3′ were used. The real time PCR mixture with reaction volume 20 μl contained 10 μl of Sybr green master mix, 1 μl cDNA and 5 pmoles each of primers.
