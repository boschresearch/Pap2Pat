                        "Salmonellosis is one of the most commonly reported zoonotic diseases in humans. In the United States alone, it causes an estimated 1.3 million human food-borne illnesses and more than 500 deaths each year (Messens et al., 2013). Salmonella serotypes enteritidis and typhimurium are frequently detected in human infections (Ravel et al., 2010). Salmonellas are widely distributed in nature, and they are commonly carried by wild or farm-animal vectors. Poultry is known to be a major global reservoir of Salmonellas. Salmonella live in poultry gut as transient members of the intestinal microbial population without causing disease. Colonization of Salmonella does not usually affect poultry body weight gain or performance; thus, asymptomatic infection can increase the likelihood of zoonotic transmission to humans through the food chain (Hugas et al., 2014; Mazengia et al., 2014). Chicks can become infected vertically (from adults via the egg to the chick) or horizontally (from the environment, pests, or feed) (Cox et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2006).",
                        "Salmonella enterica is one of the two main Salmonella species that causes gastroenteritis in humans. S. enterica is subdivided into 6 subspecies and almost all human infections are caused by subspecies I (enterica). More than 2600 serovars of S. enterica have been identified (Popoff and Le Minor, 1997); however, only a few of these serovars are responsible for most Salmonella infections in human and domestic animals (Porwollik et al., 2004).",
                        "The large and growing market for broiler chickens and eggs, and the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of Salmonella have led to public health concerns, change in government regulation policies in Europe and North America and further demands to enact laws to control Salmonella levels in poultry (Hugas, et al., 2014).",
                        "Vaccination strategies in broiler chickens have shown sub-optimal results to-date mostly due to the short life span of the birds. Currently, two types of Salmonella vaccines are commercially available; an attenuated live vaccine and an inactivated vaccine. These vaccines are often administered to both breeder and layer flocks, but their effectiveness depends on the targeted serovar, host species, and whether reduction rather than eradication is the objective (Doyle and Erickson, 2006). These vaccines do not eliminate initial colonization of the mucosal surfaces, particularly in the young bird (Dougan et al., 1988). Effective control depends upon a number of factors, including improved on-farm biosecurity, use of best practices in husbandry and use of vaccination and competitive exclusion products and feed additives. Preventive hygienic measures typically involve establishing effective farm-site biosecurity and poultry house sanitation protocols. Other more targeted strategies are being developed. For instance, a combination of Salmonella-specific lytic phages has been recently approved in Europe for applications in food packaging. Others have proposed and tested inclusion of bacteriocins and/or tailspike phage protein (Chakchouk-Mtibaa et al., 2014; Waseh et al., 2010) in the poultry feed for controlling Salmonella but to date none of these products has been commercialized.",
                        "It would be advantageous to provide antibodies or fragments thereof that assist in the reduction, prevention and/or treatment of Salmonella infection."

Single domain antibodies are, in general, significantly more resistant to proteases than conventional antibodies. Furthermore, VHHs are known to be amenable to polypeptide engineering for optimization of biophysical features including heat and protease resistance (Hussack et al., 2014). Scaffold engineering of portions of the polypeptide both inside and outside of the CDR regions are known in the art and can confer increased target affinity, protease resistance, as well as thermal and low pH resistance. For example, to favour the entropy of binding, the extended flexible CDR3 loop may be constrained with an interloop disulfide bond that connects CDR1 and CDR3, or CDR2 position 55 and CDR3 or FR2 at position 50 and CDR3 (Muyldermans, 2013; Conrath et al, 2003). The cysteine of CDR3 that participates in either disulfide bond formation mentioned above can occur or be placed at any position of the extended CDR3 loop (Conrath et al, 2003). The stability of a VHH can be increased by introducing cysteine at position 54 and 78 to form an additional disulfide bond. This disulfide bond is known to make VHHs highly resistant to degradation by pepsin or chymotrypsin (Hagihara et al, 2007; Saerens et al, 2008; Hussack et al, 2014).",

Reducing Salmonella within the animal's gastrointestinal tract is one way to reduce contamination within the animal's environment, leading to a safer food supply chain with lower incidence of contamination.",
                                "Co-administration of another substance that is effective against Salmonella is also a possible strategy for reducing Salmonella in an animal environment. For example, administering to the animal an antibiotic either at the same time as a co-formulation or at an adjacent time to the delivery of the antibody or antibody fragment can have an additive effect or may have a synergistic effect. The result of which may be a reduced likelihood of Salmonella contamination, but also reduced usage of antibiotic (i.e., fractional usage of antibiotic with synergistic efficacy). A bacteriocin effective against Salmonella can also be provided to the animal with the antibody or antibody fragment for an additive or synergistic effect. In addition to, or as an alternative to bacteriocin, any other plant- or animal-derived compound, such as a small molecule, peptide, or protein, that has an effect against Salmonella may be used together with the antibody or antibody fragment described herein. A competitive microbe may also be provided to the animal concurrently with the antibody or antibody fragment in order to possibly achieve an additive or a synergistic effect. The competitive microbe may be used together with the antibody or antibody fragment described herein as part of a probiotic system.

However, and in addition, the form of antibody or antibody fragment delivery may also be altered with pharmaceutically acceptable coatings or excipients that provide a protective effect against gut enzymes, thermal or low pH effects. In this way, the sequence of the antibody or antibody fragment itself need not be modified, but rather the formulation prepared for oral delivery may itself be more optimal for the species of subject to which the antibody or antibody fragment is to be delivered.

                                "A phage display library was constructed using a standard protocol (Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 2009). Lymphocytes were collected from the blood using Lymphoprep\u2122 Tubes (Axis-Shield\u2122, Oslo, Norway). Total RNA was isolated from approximately 1\u00d7107 lymphocytes collected on day 36 post-immunization using RNAzol\u2122 kit (Bioshop\u2122\u2032 Burlington, Ontario, Canada). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers from the SuperScript III First Strand\u2122 cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen\u2122, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) using 6 \u03bcg total RNA as template according to manufacturer's recommendations. Variable and part of the constant domains DNA were amplified using oligonucleotides MJ1-3 (sense) and two CH2 domain antisense primers, CH2 and CH2b3 (for primer sequences see Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 2009; Baral et al. 2013) and heavy chain fragments (550-650 bp in length) were purified using the E.Z.N.A.\u2122 Cycle Pure PCR purification Kit (Omega Bio-tek\u2122 Norcross, Ga., USA). The variable regions of heavy chain antibodies (IgG2 and IgG3) were re-amplified in a second PCR reaction using MJ7 and LP6-MJ8 primers (for primer sequences, see Baral et al. 2013). The amplified PCR products were purified with the Cycle Pure Kit\u2122 (Omega Bio-tek\u2122), digested with Sfil (Thermoscientific\u2122, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and re-purified using the same kit. Twelve micrograms of digested VHH fragments were ligated with 40 \u03bcg (1:3 molar ratio, respectively) Sfi-digested pADL-23c phagemid vector (Antibody Design Labs\u2122, San Diego, Calif., USA) using T4 DNA ligase system and its protocol (Promega\u2122, Madison, Wis., USA), transformed into commercial electrocompetent TG1 E. coli cells (Lucigen\u2122 Corporation, Middleton, Wis., USA), as described previously (Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 2009), and a library size of 7.8\u00d7108 transformants was obtained. The VHH fragments from 50 colonies were PCR-amplified and sequenced to analyze the complexity of the library; all clones had inserts of expected sizes and were different from each other at their CDR regions as determined by sequencing of their encoding VHH fragments. The library was grown for 3-4 hours at 37\u00b0 C., 250 rpm in 2\u00d7YT/Carb-Glucose (1% w/v) medium. The bacterial cells were pelleted, resuspended in the same medium and stored as glycerol stock at \u221280\u00b0 C. as described previously (Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 2009)."

For the panning against whole Salmonella, the bacterial cells from 4 different strains were equally mixed and adjusted to an OD of 1 using PBS solution. The bacterial mixes were inactivated at 65\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes and coated on a 96 well Maxisorb\u2122 plate. To pan against flagellin protein (Flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium, purchased from Sigma\u2122, cat #: SRP8029), flagellin solution (5 ug/ml, dissolved in PBS solution) was coated on a 96 well Maxisorp\u2122 plate. For each panning, BSA-PBS solution (0.5% of BSA dissolved in PBS solution) was also coated on the same 96-well Maxisorp\u2122 plate as a pre-screening control. The coated plates were then incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. Next day, the coated wells were rinsed with PBS once and blocked with BSA-PBS solution for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. The Salmonella phage library was diluted using BSA-PBS solution so that approximately 2\u00d71012 phage particles were added first to the BSA-PBS wells and kept at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour and then the supernatant was transferred to the Salmonella whole cell or flagellin wells. The phage particles were incubated in the Salmonella whole cell or flagellin wells for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and then washed 5 times with PBST containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20. The bound phages were eluted with 0.1 M triethylamine, neutralized with 1M Tris-HCL, PH 7.4 and incubated with exponentially growing TG1 cells in 10 ml of 2YT medium. After 30 min incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the cells were superinfected with 1011 M13KO7 helper phage (New England Biolabs\u2122) for an additional 30 min. Two antibiotics, ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/L) and Kanamycin (25 \u03bcg/L), were added to the TG1 culture medium. Incubation continued at 37 QC for 16 hours, followed by selection of the phage infected TG1 cells. In the third day of panning, the amplified phage particles in culture supernatant were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) as described previously (Arbabi-Ghahroudi et al., 2009). Briefly, 10 ml of phage infected TG1 culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, the supernatant was filtered with a 0.22 \u03bcm filter and mixed with 1/5 volume of PEG/NaCl (20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl) on ice for 1 hour. The phages were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Finally, the enriched phage pool was suspended in 200 \u03bcl of PBS and ready for the next round of panning. Panning was continued for three more rounds following the same conditions except that washing was increased 7, 10 and 12 times with PBST for the second, third and fourth rounds of panning, respectively. After four rounds of panning, 96 randomly picked colonies were grown and subjected to phage ELISA screening."

Colonies were screened by colony PCR for inserts and the DNA was sequenced. The sequences were aligned and categorized into 18 different groupings or classes; each represented by one or more clones and each representing the same amino acid sequence (Table 1). A single clone was randomly selected from each class. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the 18 selected VHHs are shown in FIG. 1.

Phages in 2YT medium supernatant (1004) were added to blocked coated microtitre plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Wells were washed with PBST solution and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (1:5000 in PBST) (Sigma-Aldrich\u2122 GE27-9421-01) at room temperature for half an hour. Wells were washed again and signal was detected using 50 ul/well TMB peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories\u2122, Gaithersburg, Md., USA). Reactions were stopped by adding 50 ul/well of 1M hydrochloric acid and A450 was measured using a Cytation\u2122 5 (Biotek\u2122) multimode reader. As shown in FIG. 4, a number of the VHHs were determined to bind to one or more of Salmonella flagellin and/or the Salmonella serovar whole cells. For example, robust binding was observed for VHH 1E05 against all inactivated S. Hadar and S. Heidelberg strains tested.

Furthermore, binding cannot be discounted for VHHs that were not show to bind according to this assay, as said assay is limited by the presentation of antigen on coated plates and by the variation in growth rates of phages displaying particular VHHs."
