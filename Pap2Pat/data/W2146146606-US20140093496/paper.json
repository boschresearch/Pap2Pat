    "title": "Engineered antibody Fc variant with selectively enhanced Fc RIIb binding over both Fc RIIaR131 and Fc RIIaH131",
    "date": "2013-06-05",
    "abstract": "Engaging inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb by Fc region has been recently reported to be an attractive approach for improving the efficacy of antibody therapeutics. However, the previously reported S267E/L328F variant with enhanced binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb, also enhances binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIa(R131) allotype to a similar degree because Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIa(R131) are structurally similar. In this study, we applied comprehensive mutagenesis and structure-guided design based on the crystal structure of the Fc/Fc\u03b3RIIb complex to identify a novel Fc variant with selectively enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIb binding over both Fc\u03b3RIIa(R131) and Fc\u03b3RIIa(H131). This novel variant has more than 200-fold stronger binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb than wild-type IgG1, while binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIa(R131) and Fc\u03b3RIIa(H131) is comparable with or lower than wild-type IgG1. This selectivity was achieved by conformational change of the C(H)2 domain by mutating Pro to Asp at position 238. Fc variant with increased binding to both Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIa induced platelet aggregation and activation in an immune complex form in vitro while our novel variant did not. When applied to agonistic anti-CD137 IgG1 antibody, our variant greatly enhanced the agonistic activity. Thus, the selective enhancement of Fc\u03b3RIIb binding achieved by our Fc variant provides a novel tool for improving the efficacy of antibody therapeutics.",

                "IgG-based monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become important therapeutic options for numerous diseases (Brekke and Sandlie, 2003; Maggon, 2007). Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R)-dependent cytotoxicity plays an important role in the antitumor activity of mAbs for cancer immunotherapy (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2012).",
                "Several works describe engineering the Fc region to enhance the effector function of mAbs by increasing the binding affinity for active Fc\u03b3Rs (Fc\u03b3RIa, Fc\u03b3RIIa and Fc\u03b3RIIIa) with amino acid substitutions. For example, antibodies engineered to have increased binding affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIIa exhibited superior in vitro ADCC activity and in vivo antitumor activity compared with wild-type mAbs (Stavenhagen et al., 2007; Zalevsky et al., 2009). In addition to protein engineering, glyco-engineered tumor-specific mAbs with afucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides at Asn297 in the Fc region showed increased binding affinity for human Fc\u03b3RIIIa and mouse Fc\u03b3RIV, which resulted in enhancing the therapeutic activity in mouse models (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2005; Mossner et al., 2010).",
                "In contrast to these activating Fc\u03b3Rs that function as immunostimulatory receptors, inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb is reported to function as an immunomodulatory receptor (Li and Ravetch, 2011; White et al., 2011). The inhibitory receptor Fc\u03b3RIIb is the only IgG Fc receptor expressed on B-cells and plays a critical role in regulating B-cell homeostasis (Heyman, 2003; Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008). Immune complexes (ICs) coengage Fc\u03b3RIIb and B-cell receptor (BCR) and then selectively suppress B-cells that recognize cognate antigen (Heyman, 2003). Fc\u03b3RIIb also regulates other B-cell stimulators that amplify B-cell proliferation and differentiation and suppresses the expression of costimulatory molecules (Leibson, 2004; Crowley et al., 2009).",
                "Fc\u03b3RIIb also plays an inhibitory role in a homeostatic checkpoint of dendritic cells (DCs) for inducing tolerance or immunity by ICs, in contrast to Fc\u03b3RIIa. While ligation of Fc\u03b3RIIa led to DC maturation, targeting Fc\u03b3RIIb alone did not activate DCs (Boruchov et al., 2005). Fc\u03b3RIIb on DCs induced peripheral tolerance by inhibiting antigenic processing and DC activation to suppress T-cell activation (Desai et al., 2007).",
                "Besides these inhibitory effects of Fc\u03b3RIIb, several groups have recently reported that Fc\u03b3RIIb enhances the agonistic activity of anti-tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily antibody by working as a scaffold (White et al., 2013). Proliferation of antigen-specific T-cells induced by anti-CD40 antibodies was abrogated in Fc\u03b3RIIb-deficient mice (White et al., 2011; Li and Ravetch, 2012). Anti-death receptor 5 (DR5) agonist antibody also required Fc\u03b3RIIb to exert its agonistic activity and initiate apoptosis in lymphoma cells (Wilson et al., 2011). The Fc\u03b3RIIb-expressing cells are considered to work as a scaffold to efficiently crosslink anti-CD40 or DR5 antibodies bound to target cells via Fc\u03b3RIIb.",
                "In order to exploit these properties, engineering Fc region to increase the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb is considered to be a promising approach. Introducing S267E/L328F substitutions into the Fc region of human IgG1 increased the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb 430-fold without increasing that to Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIaH131 or Fc\u03b3RIIIa (Chu et al., 2008). Anti-CD19 antibody with the Fc promoted suppression of B-cell activation and proliferation in SLE mouse model by coengaging Fc\u03b3RIIb with BCR (Horton et al., 2011). Recent reports noted that anti-IgE antibody with S267E/L328F Fc variant reduced the production of IgE in vivo (Chu et al., 2012) and that the Fc\u025b domain fused with S267E/L328F Fc variant suppressed degranulation and calcium mobilization of mast cells (Cemerski et al., 2012). Moreover, agonistic antibodies against CD40 or DR5 showed more potent agonistic activity in vivo with enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIb binding (Li and Ravetch, 2011, 2012). These reports clearly demonstrate that engineered Fc with enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb has various therapeutic applications. However, it was reported that S267E/L328F substitutions also enhanced the binding to one of the Fc\u03b3RIIa allotypes, Fc\u03b3RIIaR131, to a level similar to the binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb (Smith et al., 2012). Therefore, when applying the substitutions to mAb therapeutics, the consequence of increasing the binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa should be considered.",
                "It is reported that a high incidence of thromboembolic complication was observed in patients treated with anti-CD154 or anti-VEGF antibody in clinical settings (Boumpas et al., 2003; Scappaticci et al., 2007). The ICs composing of these antibodies and the antigens activated platelets and induced thrombosis in human Fc\u03b3RIIa transgenic mice by crosslinking Fc\u03b3RIIa expressed on the platelets (Meyer et al., 2009; Robles-Carrillo et al., 2010). Moreover, intravenous immunoglobulins also induced Fc\u03b3RIIa-mediated platelet aggregation in vitro (Pollreisz et al., 2008). These results demonstrate that even wild-type IgG1 generally has a potential risk of inducing thromboembolism through an Fc\u03b3RIIa-dependent mechanism, suggesting that this risk could be increased if the binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa is enhanced. Therefore, considering the therapeutic applications, antibody with selectively enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb relative to both Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 and Fc\u03b3RIIaH131 is preferred.",
                "In this work, we investigated antibodies with selectively enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb over both Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 and Fc\u03b3RIIaH131. We screened a large set of single substituted variants of human IgG1 for binding to human Fc\u03b3Rs and found a distinct variant that distinguishes Fc\u03b3RIIb from both Fc\u03b3RIIa allotypes. We solved its crystal structure in complex with human Fc\u03b3RIIb and elucidated the structural recognition mechanism by which it recognizes Fc\u03b3RIIb over both Fc\u03b3RIIa allotypes. In order to improve its Fc\u03b3RIIb binding, we conducted further optimization and identified a novel antibody variant with over 200-fold more enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb without increasing the binding to either Fc\u03b3RIIa allotype. Structural analysis of this variant revealed the mechanism of the improved binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb. We also report that antibody that also has enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa is more likely to activate platelets and induce aggregation and would have a shorter in vivo half-life compared to wild-type IgG1. We also confirmed that this variant enhanced the agonistic activity of anti-CD137 antibody in vitro. Our results indicate that the novel Fc variant with purely selectively enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb is applicable to a broad range of therapeutic antibodies, since it avoids increasing the potential to activate or aggregate platelets and to have rapid clearance in vivo."

                        "We screened a large set of over 500 variants prepared by replacing each of about 30 residues in the lower hinge and CH2 region with every naturally occurring amino acid except for cysteine, for binding to human Fc\u03b3RIIaH131, Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 and Fc\u03b3RIIb in order to identify substitutions that selectively enhance Fc\u03b3RIIb binding relative to both Fc\u03b3RIIa allotypes. The effect of each substitution on the binding to Fc\u03b3RIIaR131, Fc\u03b3RIIaH131 and Fc\u03b3RIIb is compared in Fig.\u00a01A and B.

                "Several efforts to improve Fc\u03b3R binding by Fc engineering have been reported to date. While most of the engineering enhances the binding affinity for activating Fc\u03b3Rs (Stavenhagen et al., 2007; Zalevsky et al., 2009; Mossner et al., 2010), engineering to enhance binding affinity to inhibitory Fc\u03b3R is limited (Chu et al., 2008). S267E/L328F variant, the Fc variant reported to have the highest affinity for inhibitory Fc\u03b3R binding, enhanced the binding affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb by 355-fold; however, it also enhanced the binding affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 to the same level as Fc\u03b3RIIb (Smith et al., 2012). The high similarity between Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 suggests that discriminating Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 by Fc engineering is challenging (Supplementary Fig. S1).",
                "In this work, we investigated the substitutions to distinguish Fc\u03b3RIIb from Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 by comprehensive mutagenesis and discovered a highly selective substitution, P238D, which provides the highest selectivity for Fc\u03b3RIIb relative to all the other active Fc\u03b3Rs including Fc\u03b3RIIaR131. Fc variants which discriminate Fc\u03b3RIIb from Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 were extremely rare, probably because Fc\u03b3RIIb is highly homologous to Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 (Supplementary Fig. S1) and the Fc-Fc\u03b3RIIb interface would be also highly homologous to the Fc-Fc\u03b3RIIaR131. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report illustrating an Fc variant that enhances Fc\u03b3RIIb binding while distinguishing Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 precisely.",
                "To elucidate the structural mechanism by which P238D variant discriminates Fc\u03b3RIIb from Fc\u03b3RIIaR131, we solved the crystal structure of the complex of Fc(P238D) and Fc\u03b3RIIb. Our structural analysis indicated that the high selectivity of P238D variant was achieved by a dynamic conformational change of the Fc-Fc\u03b3RIIb interface that was induced by P238D substitution into wild-type IgG1. In reported Fc(IgG1) structures, Pro238 forms a hydrophobic core with its surrounding residues. Therefore, substituting this hydrophobic Pro238 to hydrophilic Asp should cause large free energy loss for desolvation of Asp to maintain the same structure. To avoid this free energy loss, Asp238 showed a large shift out of its original position to achieve access to the solvent region. Additionally, the position of Pro238 in Fc(IgG1) was occupied by Leu235 instead in CH2-A of Fc(P238D) complexed with Fc\u03b3RIIb. As the result, the large conformational change of loop233\u2013240 attached to the hinge region was observed. This change would affect the domain arrangement between the CH2-A and B domains because both CH2 domains connect by S\u2013S bonds in the hinge region and cannot move independently. In fact, the relative arrangement of CH2-A and B domains in the Fc(P238D)/Fc\u03b3RIIb complex was different from that of Fc(IgG1)/Fc\u03b3RIIaR131, despite Fc\u03b3RIIb having the highest homology to Fc\u03b3RIIaR131. As the result of these dynamic conformational changes, Fc(P238D) acquired two novel interactions with Fc\u03b3RIIb. One is the hydrogen bond between the main chain of Gly237 in CH2-A and the side chain of Tyr160 in Fc\u03b3RIIb. Both Fc\u03b3RIIa allotype cannot make this hydrogen bond because corresponding residue of this Tyr is Phe in Fc\u03b3RIIa (Supplementary Fig. S1). So, this interaction would play a critical role for distinguishing Fc\u03b3RIIb from Fc\u03b3RIIa. The other one is the salt bridge between Asp270 in CH2-A and Arg131 of Fc\u03b3RIIb. This salt bridge would contribute to improve not only the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb but also the selectivity over Fc\u03b3RIIaH131 because this allotype has His as the corresponding residue of Arg131 in Fc\u03b3RIIb. On the other hand, the S267E/L328F variant increased binding affinity to both Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 to the same extent, while it did not increase binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIaH131 or other Fc\u03b3Rs. From the reported complex structure of Fc(IgG1)/Fc\u03b3RIIaR131, we elucidated that Glu267 of the Fc with S267E/L328F substitution would form a salt bridge with Arg131 of the Fc\u03b3RIIb and also of the Fc\u03b3RIIaR131. This might explain the reason for the lack of selectivity of the S267E/L328F variant to Fc\u03b3RIIb over Fc\u03b3RIIaR131, both of which have Arg at position 131. Large conformational change induced by P238D would also explain the reason for lack of additive effect of combining P238D with L328E or S267E/L328F.",
                "Then, in order to further increase the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb, we conducted a second comprehensive mutagenesis using the P238D variant as a template rather than combining substitution(s) effective for wild-type IgG1 template, since the interface of Fc(P238D)/Fc\u03b3RIIb was considered to be significantly changed from that of Fc(IgG1)/Fc\u03b3RIIb. P238D-based comprehensive and combinatorial study identified V12 variant whose affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb was significantly increased from P238D variant. Especially, P271G markedly increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb. The substitution of fixed proline to flexible glycine would contribute to release conformational stress when a salt bridge between Asp270 in Fc (V12) and Arg131 in Fc\u03b3RIIb is formed, which is considered to contribute to the affinity improvement for Fc\u03b3RIIb.",
                "Structural analysis of P238D suggests that P238D substitution seemed to destabilize the hydrophobic core of CH2 domain, although this could be partially compensated by Leu235 as found in CH2-A domain. The conformational changes seem to be the cause of decreased TM for V12 variant. Although this reduced TM raised concern regarding the storage stability of Fc(V12) for pharmaceutical application, its stability (aggregation tendency at 100 mg/ml) was comparable with that of wild-type IgG1.",
                "It is known that, for IgG1 antibody to have a long half-life in vivo, binding to FcRn at acidic pH is important. The affinity of V12 variant for hFcRn was comparable with that of wild-type IgG1 and, consistently, the in vivo half-life of V12 variant was also comparable with that of wild-type IgG1. However, it should be noted that because the binding affinity of V12 variant to murine Fc\u03b3RIIb (the mouse counterpart of human Fc\u03b3RIIb) was not increased, its effect on the pharmacokinetics was not addressed in this study.",
                "ICs induce platelet aggregation and activation when antibody binds to Fc\u03b3RIIa expressed on the platelet surface (Boumpas et al., 2003; Scappaticci et al., 2007). The previous studies suggest that ICs consisting of IgG with enhanced binding to Fc\u03b3RIIa have the potential to induce platelet aggregation and activation more intensively than IC consisting of wild-type IgG. However, the effect of engineered Fc with enhanced binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIa on platelet activation and aggregation induced by IC has not so far been investigated. In this report, IC consisting of IgE and anti-IgE antibody with enhanced binding affinity to both Fc\u03b3RIIb and Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 (S267E/L328F variant) induced the activation and aggregation of platelets obtained from Fc\u03b3RIIa genotype of R/R131 homozygous donors, but not from Fc\u03b3RIIa genotype of H/H131 homozygous donors. On the other hand, anti-IgE antibody with selectively enhanced binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb did not induce the activation or aggregation of platelets from donors with either genotype. Platelets whose Fc\u03b3RIIa genotype is R/H131 are considered to express both Fc\u03b3RIIa allotypes on their surface, while platelets whose Fc\u03b3RIIa genotype is R/R131 express only Fc\u03b3RIIaR131. Therefore, a similar tendency will be observed in the platelets from heterozygous donors, although the induction of the aggregation and activation might be milder.",
                "It is known that Fc\u03b3RIIa internalizes ICs by endocytosis and transfers them to lysosomal degradation (Zhang and Booth, 2010), while Fc\u03b3RIIb recycles the internalized ICs (Bergtold et al., 2005; Mousavi et al., 2007). These reports suggest that an antibody with enhanced binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIa would be more rapidly eliminated from plasma by Fc\u03b3RIIa-mediated uptake and degradation than wild-type IgG1, while an antibody with enhanced binding only to Fc\u03b3RIIb would have a longer half-life because the antibody would be recycled back to the cell surface. Indeed, an antibody with enhanced binding to both murine Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII (counterpart of human Fc\u03b3RIIa) exhibited more rapid clearance from plasma compared with an antibody with enhanced binding only to murine Fc\u03b3RII (data not shown).",
                "These facts indicate that therapeutic IgG with S267E/L328F substitution has the potential to induce platelet aggregation and activation and to be rapidly cleared from plasma in patients with Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 genotype. One report described that the allelic frequency of R/R131, R/H131 and H/H131 is 31, 44 and 25%, respectively, among healthy Caucasians, and 26, 43 and 31%, respectively, among healthy African Americans (Lehrnbecher et al., 1999). Another report showed that in Japanese, Chinese and Asian Indian populations the R/R131 genotype occurs in 6, 6 and 31%, respectively (Osborne et al., 1994). Considering the proportion of populations with R/R and R/H genotypes, enhancing the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 would have a substantial impact.",
                "Previous studies using S267E/L328F or S267E substitution(s) have demonstrated that enhancing affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb is a promising application for therapeutic antibodies against CD19, IgE, DR5 and CD40 (Li and Ravetch, 2011, 2012; Chu et al., 2012; Hammer, 2012). Consistent with these reports, V12 variant, as well as S267E/L328F variant, enhanced agonistic activity of antibody against CD137, one of TNFR superfamily molecules, compared with intact human IgG1. Since agonistic antibodies against TNFR superfamily are currently being explored for cancer immunotherapy, enhancement of the agonistic activity of these antibodies by selectively improving the binding affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb could be a promising approach. In addition, in Ba/F3 cells expressing constitutively active mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinase, Kit, ICs that crosslinked Fc\u03b3RIIb and Kit inhibited growth factor-independent proliferation (Malbec and Da\u00ebron, 2012). In another report, ICs suppressed the TLR4-mediated response of DCs in rheumatoid arthritis patients through Fc\u03b3RIIb. Each of these effects of Fc\u03b3RIIb could be enhanced by applying Fc with enhanced affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb. Moreover, ICs significantly suppressed expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 on Fc\u03b3RIIb-overexpressing DCs, suggesting that in DCs, using ICs consisting of an antibody variant with selectively enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIb affinity relative to Fc\u03b3RIIa might polarize IC-triggered activating signals to inhibitory signals (Zhang et al., 2011)."

                "In this study, we screened antibody Fc variant which selectively enhances the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb over both Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 and Fc\u03b3RIIaH131 by comprehensive mutagenesis. We identified a distinct substitution, P238D, that could discriminate Fc\u03b3RIIb from Fc\u03b3RIIaR131 precisely, and crystal structural analysis revealed that this substitution substantially changed the recognition interface of Fc-Fc\u03b3RIIb. We further designed an antibody variant with 200-fold higher affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb than IgG1 without increasing the affinity for other active Fc\u03b3Rs. The variant was comparable with IgG1 in terms of pharmacokinetics and storage stability. We also showed that an antibody with increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIa has an increased possibility of inducing platelet activation and aggregation and of being rapidly cleared from plasma. Since previous studies and our study using agonist anti-CD137 antibody suggested that increasing the binding affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb has various therapeutic applications, our engineered Fc, which enhances binding selectivity to Fc\u03b3RIIb, is expected to have a significant therapeutic potential."
