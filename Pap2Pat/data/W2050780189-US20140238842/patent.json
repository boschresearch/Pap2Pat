This process is further coined as \u201cPulsed Laser-induced Photochemical Stitching (PLPS)\u201d technique. Therefore, the term Laser-induced Dissociative Stitching (LDS) as well as \u201cPulsed Laser-induced Photochemical Stitching (PLPS)\u201d are used interchangeably through- out the text of the specification and a skilled person will appreciate the same as such.",

However, by the process of the instant invention one can achieve layered (onion-like) intermediates formed by the stitching process which can lead to other forms through secondary absorption.",
                        "A laser represents an interesting source of controlled optical energy transfer to any chemical system at room temperature and hence can be envisaged to offer new solutions in the present context. The process of the current invention using the laser photochemistry does not require heating of the reactant environment and the synthesis can be easily tuned by controlling the reactant mixtures, laser energy density, pulsed repetition rate (in the case of pulsed laser) etc.",
                        "A novel process of the current invention comprising the Laser-induced Dissociative Stitching (LDS) technology is introduced to engineer solid carbon nanoparticles ranging from size 2 nm to 200 nm from liquid halogen containing aromatic molecules including haloaromatics such as chlorobenzene, o-Dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, biphenyl containing halogen etc. at standard room temperature and laboratory environment (non-inert conditions).",
                        "The laser assisted synthesis of composite materials of the current invention is achieved by in-situ irradiation in liquid halo aromatics wherein the carbon synthesized binds with materials such as polymers and other organic compounds.",
                        "In an embodiment, the Laser-induced Dissociative Stitching process comprises irradiating halogen containing aromatic molecules with an excimer laser source at room temperature and under non-inert conditions to obtain solid carbon and carbon based nanocomposite material.",
                        "The excimer lasers are of the noble gas halide type such as XeCl (308 nm), KrF (248 nm), ArF (193 nm) which can generate significant light intensity in the narrow UV region, preferably KrF. The said lasers have a potential to bring about direct photolysis and photoreaction control in absence of catalysts. The laser wavelength is chosen so as to have photon energy that can dissociate the carbon-halogen bond effectively during the process.",
                        "A sample of transparent liquid halobenzene selected from chlorobenzene (CB) or dichlorobenzene (DCB) is irradiated with high energy photons from a KrF excimer laser source (wavelength-248 nm, frequency-10 Hz) to obtain novel solid carbon material and characterized by XRD (FIG. 2a) and Raman spectroscopy (FIG. 2b). TGA studies on the CNSs obtained from CB and DCB are used to determine their thermal stability in air. It is observed that the CNSs are air stable up to a temperature of 400-450\u00b0 C. The BET surface area measurement yielded the surface area for CNSs synthesized from CB and DCB to be 38 m2/g and 108 m2/g respectively.",
                        "The excimer laser for providing high energy photons can be operated either in continuous wave (CW) or pulsed mode of operation.",
                        "The high energy photons from a laser source results in the dissociation of C\u2014Cl bonds in the compound generating a large number of free radicals. The free radicals are stitched into graphitic networks which further curve into nanospheres of carbon. The graphitic stitching process involves the release of H free radicals as well. These H radicals combine with the Cl free radicals to give HCl dissolved in the system. The presence of HCl is confirmed by pH paper test which gives a pink colour indicating a strong acidic environment. Thus free radicals re-organize to form solid carbon structures. Thus various carbon structures by varying precursors (haloaromatic molecules) and laser energy parameters are achieved. Similarly, different carbon-based nano composites are synthesized by the present LDS method by including constituent materials or their precursors in the halogen containing aromatic systems to give corresponding carbon based nanocomposites. (The laser induced stitching process is described in FIG. 17).",
                        "To further establish that the nano-carbon formation by stitching process is exclusive to the C\u2014Cl bond and not due to the breakdown of the aromatic ring in the haloaromatic compounds used, a control experiment is performed with benzene (FIG. 16). No optically absorbing (black) compound formation is observed in the irradiation of benzene at 248 nm even after 1 h. This clearly proves that the carbon formed with haloaromatics does not involve the breakage of the carbon bonds in the aromatic ring.",
                        "In an embodiment, the present invention discloses synthesis of carbon-based nanocomposites of Degussa P25 commercial TiO2 with the conducting carbon spheres that are obtained by irradiation of DCB and CB with Degussa P25. The XRD and the Raman spectra are given in FIGS. 10 and 11 respectively.",
                        "In another embodiment, the present invention provides irradiation of a bicyclic ring containing chlorine. 1-Chloro Naphthalene is used to prove the generic nature of this process. The obtained solid carbon from the liquid precursor is verified by the Raman data of the compound (FIG. 13). The conducting nature of this compound is also checked by the I-V characteristics (FIG. 14).",
                        "The Laser-induced Dissociative Stitching process of the instant invention is amenable to localized synthesis wherein the laser power can be focused at the desired spot. It can be tuned by choosing different wavelengths which can be transported into the reactant media over specific short enough length scales and the pulse width. The concentrations of reactants and related dynamics can also be controlled in different ways such as direct addition and mixing or drop wise addition etc.",

The solution gradually turned black due to the formation of optically absorbing solid state material (FIG. 2, photo). The black solution formed was then filtered through 0.2 \u03bcm (pore size) Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. A black carbonaceous solid was obtained, which was thoroughly characterized. Similarly, 50 ml of liquid CB was irradiated for 30 minutes. Interestingly, CB was noted to take a longer time for the product formation, presumably due to the availability of a single reaction site (C\u2014Cl bond) in comparison with the two sites on DCB.",

The XRD data reveals the disordered graphitic nature of the material. The greater the deviation from the ideal graphitic (002) peak position at 26.6\u00b0, the greater is the disordered nature of the system. The broad peaks indicate that there is no long range order and point to the presence of graphitic nanoparticles in the system.",
                                "In both the cases Raman spectroscopy (FIG. 2(b)) exhibits the usual \u2018G Band\u2019 at 1590 cm\u22121 attributed to the E2g symmetry mode of the sp2 carbon in carbon compounds. A \u2018D Band\u2019 also exists at 1345 cm\u22121. The D band arises due to hexagonal ring systems in the compound and is a forbidden transition. It becomes an allowed transition due to defects in the system. In crystalline compounds like pure graphite, there are very few defects and hence the D band is absent. However with decreasing particle size and increasing defect concentration, the intensity of the D band increases. An intense D band also indicates a larger presence of hexagonal ring systems. In pure amorphous carbon an intense D band does not exist. A shoulder to the G band appears in such systems. It is also clear that decreasing particle size and increasing defects contribute to a greater ID/IG ratio. Since the carbon compounds obtained in the present invention show a high ID/IG ratio (1 in the case of CB and 0.95 in the case of DCB) presence of nanoparticles is therefore clearly suggested.",

The results of conductivity measurements are shown in FIG. 2d. The observed frequency independence of conductivity over the low frequency range clearly establishes the conducting nature of carbon obtained. The conductivity values for carbon synthesized from CB and DCB are about 7.5\u00d710\u22123 and 5.5\u00d710\u22123 S cm \u22121.

                                "To establish even broader applicability of the method, in-situ synthesis of carbon based inorganic nanocomposite Ti/O2-Carbon was prepared by adding TiO2 (Degussa P25) powder to DCB and sonicated. The mixture was then irradiated by 248 nm UV laser pulses with constant stirring for 10 mins. The compound obtained was filtered and then washed by centrifugation by water and acetone (3 times). The nanocomposite of carbon and TiO2 were evaluated by Raman Spectra and TEM images in FIG. 12. Such metal oxide-conducting carbon composite systems have tremendous potential for energy storage applications (ultra-capacitors  and Li-ion battery).",
                                "In conclusion, the Laser-induced Dissociative Stitching (LSD) offers a new route of synthesizing carbon forms and carbon based nanocomposites at room temperature and mild conditions involving halogen containing, aromatic precursors. The process of the instant invention further provides access to synthesize doped carbon (eg. N doped carbon, S-doped carbon) materials by using heterocyclic aromatic precursors containing halogens. The Laser-induced Dissociative Stitching (LSD) therefore offers a very wide approach in science of carbon synthesis.",
                                "Thus a novel PLPS (Pulsed Laser-induced Photochemical Stitching) process is introduced by the present invention to engineer solid carbon nanoparticles from liquid halobenzenes by laser photochemistry at room temperature and laboratory environment. Electrically conducting high surface area carbon nano-spheres (CNSs) have thus been directly synthesized from routine laboratory solvents (which if discarded would be simply a toxic waste). Furthermore, in principle, a complete conversion of liquid materials (CB & DCB) to solid carbon can be achieved by a cyclic process of solvent irradiation and distillation to recycle the solvent followed by further irradiation, which we have confirmed. PLPS can thus prove to be a highly efficient route of nano-carbon synthesis.",
                                "It can also be foreseen that the demonstrated technique would be a generic pathway for generating a variety of carbon nanomaterials from halogen containing reactants at variable irradiation conditions as well as carbon-based nanocomposites by in-situ synthesis involving concurrent presence of other precursors, organic molecules, polymers or nanoparticles in the solvent. Laser photochemical synthesis does not require high temperature that is usually associated with the synthesis of carbon based materials facilitating the synthesis of carbon nanocomposites with polymers and other organic compounds. Moreover, being a laser process it is applicable for direct-write schemes of localized synthesis."
