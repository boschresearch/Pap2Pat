This strategy assembles readily available 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-diamine derivatives with electron-deficient allenes via a formal [n+2] (n=4, 5, 6) cyclization mode with an appropriate reagents such as N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) or a combination of N-chlorosuccinimide and KI to produce various piperazines, 1,4-diazepanes, and 1,4-diazocanes, respectively. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, high functional group tolerance, and scalability (gram scale). The reagents are cheap and readily available and no precious transition metal catalysts are needed. In addition to a direct one-pot reduction to the corresponding fully saturated N-heterocycles, the present disclosure also demonstrated that the primary vinylogous amide products can be converted to much more sophisticated products by using a trifluoromethyl addition or an intromolecular Mannich reaction.",
