# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to novel synthetic methods of making 1,4-diazo N-heterocycles via intermolecular amphoteric diamination of allenes, and relates to the compounds made by the novel synthetic method.

## BACKGROUND

This section introduces aspects that may help facilitate a better understanding of the disclosure. Accordingly, these statements are to be read in this light and are not to be understood as admissions about what is or is not prior art.

More than half of the FDA-approved small-molecule therapeutics contain at least one N-heterocycles. Among N-heterocycles, the saturated 1,4-diazo heterocycles including piperazine, 1,4-diazepane, and 1,4-diazocane are highly important for the development of new therapeutics. However, there is a significant lack of structural diversity of these 1,4-diazo heterocycles, especially their substation pattern on the carbon atoms, due to the lack of efficient methods or the synthetic limitations of the existing methods to synthesize these N-heterocycles.

Novel synthetic method to prepare novel diazo heterocycles are therefore needed.

## SUMMARY

The present disclosure provides novel and convenient amphoteric diamination strategy to synthesize carbon-substituted 1,4-diazo N-heterocycles in a one-pot reaction. This strategy assembles readily available 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-diamine derivatives with electron-deficient allenes via a formal [n+2] (n=4, 5, 6) cyclization mode with an appropriate reagents such as N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) or a combination of N-chlorosuccinimide and KI to produce various piperazines, 1,4-diazepanes, and 1,4-diazocanes, respectively. The reaction features mild reaction conditions, high functional group tolerance, and scalability (gram scale). The reagents are cheap and readily available and no precious transition metal catalysts are needed. In addition to a direct one-pot reduction to the corresponding fully saturated N-heterocycles, the present disclosure also demonstrated that the primary vinylogous amide products can be converted to much more sophisticated products by using a trifluoromethyl addition or an intromolecular Mannich reaction.

The present invention provides compounds with novel structures that may possess one or more of the following activities: antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, and antiparasitic activity. The compounds disclosed in the present disclosure may also be used for the compound building block for the development of new therapeutics.

General Procedure for Syntheses of Starting Material Diamines of R1NHXNYR2

The starting material 1,2-diamines with a general formula of R1NHXNYR2 can be purchased if commercial available or prepared according to literature publications. The general procedures for syntheses of starting material 1,2-diamines can be found in Squires, C., Baxter, C. W., Campbell, J., Lindoy, L. F., McNab, H., Parkin, A., Parsons, S., Tasker, P. A., Wei, G. & White, D. J. Design of base metal extractants. Part 1. Inter-ligand hydrogen bonding in the assembly of pseudo-macrocyclic bis(aminosulfonamidato)M(II) complexes. Dalton Trans. 2026-2034 (2006).

A Representative Procedure to Prepare Diamines with Formula of R1NHXNYR2:

A reaction mixture of a terminal unsubstituted diamine (10 mmol), an aldehyde (10 mmol) or ketone (10 mmol) and dry 4 Å molecular sieve (5.0 g) in dry MeOH (20 mL) was stirred for overnight under argon at room temperature. Then the reaction was then cooled to 0° C. before NaBH4 (15 mmol) was added slowly. The reaction process was monitored by TLC. Upon full conversion of the starting material, the 4 Å molecular sieve was removed by filtration. Added dichloromethane (DCM, 100 mL) and water to the filtrate. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous phase was further extracted with DCM three times. The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified on a silica gel column (the silica gel was pre-treated with Et3N) with hexane/EtOAc as the eluents to give the desired products as the starting material diamines with the formula of R1NHXNYR2.

**Step 1: General Procedure for Syntheses of 1.4 diazo N-heterocycles of Formula I**

To a 2-dram vial wrapped with aluminum foil was added a 1diamine substrate with formula of R1NHXNYR2 (0.1 mmol), NIS (0.105 mmol), and dry THF (1 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h under argon before an allene substrate (0.15 mmol) and Cs2CO3 (0.15 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was let to stir. An intermediate compound of Formula I as previous defined was made at this step.

Examples 1-2 were Prepared According to the General Procedure for Syntheses of 1.4 diazo N-heterocycles of Formula I:

The intermediate compound of Formula I may be separated or carried over to the next step without separation/purification.

**Step 2: General Procedure for Syntheses of 1.4 diazo N-heterocycles of Formula II**

After the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h, NaBH3CN (0.2 mmol) and a co-solvent of MeOH/AcOH (pH=4, 1 mL) were added to the reaction mixture with the prepared product of Formula I. After 3 h, the reaction was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3, extracted with CH2Cl2 for three times. The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was purified on silica gel column with hexane/EtOAc as eluents to give the desired 1,4-diazo N-heterocycles with the Formula II such as a piperazine product.

Examples 3-97 were Prepared According to the General Procedure for Syntheses of 1.4 diazo N-heterocycles of Formula I.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that numerous modifications can be made to the specific implementations described above. The implementations should not be limited to the particular limitations described. Other implementations may be possible.
