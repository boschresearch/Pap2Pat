                        "As a concept of reactor design, the fast reactor loaded with high-burnup metal fuel is mainly proposed to improve the inherent safety and economy of the reactor. It belongs to the scope of fast reactor and meets the technical requirements and safety standards of fourth-generation nuclear energy. The basic operating principle of the reactor design is that the neutrons transform the fissionable nuclides into the fissile nuclides, which start to burn under the impact of the neutrons. The reactor concept includes a traveling wave reactor, which continuously converts the fissionable fuel element (U-238) into a new fissile fuel element (Pu-239) after being first ignited by enriched uranium fuel, thus allowing the diffusion of breeding combustion wave. Self-breeding of reactor core significantly reduces the need for enrichment and reprocessing of uranium.",
                        "Taking the traveling wave reactor as an example, its fuel mainly comes from spent fuel and depleted uranium or natural uranium. The refueling cycle is long, and the utilization rate of uranium resources can reach 70%. It has the advantages of efficient use of uranium resources and reduced discharge of spent fuel. The widespread use of fast breeder reactors (typical examples include traveling wave reactors) will transform spent fuel into precious utilizable resources while reducing dependence on enriched uranium. The spent fuel unloaded from high-burnup fast breeder reactors does not need to be reprocessed. A large number of long-lived radionuclides transmute into light-core and short-lived radionuclides during the combustion of fast breeder reactors, thus effectively reducing the long-term radioactive risks of spent fuel. This fast reactor can realize no refueling for decades, and one fueling can meet the power generation demand for decades. This also reflects the core advantages of fast reactor loaded with high-burnup metal fuel. Despite the good development prospect, fast reactor loaded with high-burnup metal fuel still faces many problems to be addressed. One of the problems is the service performance of the fuel.",
                        "At present, the core fuel design for fast reactor loaded with high-burnup metal fuel adopts uranium-zirconium alloy fuel, and many problems for metal fuel operation in the reactor have not been solved, such as fuel swelling caused by fission products, fuel-cladding mechanical interaction (FCMI), and even pellet cracking. They are often the direct cause of the fuel system failure. These negative effects not only reduce the efficiency of reactor operation, but also increase the potential safety hazards of reactor. How to fundamentally eliminate swelling and cracking of pellets under service conditions and the FCMI caused therefrom has always been the focus of research and development personnel. While one of the main factors causing fuel swelling is the presence of fission gases. Since the fission gas atoms are insoluble in the metal fuel matrix, they can move freely in the matrix, including a series of behaviors such as migration, nucleation and formation of bubbles. The free migration of fission gas atoms and bubbles in the crystal often causes them to stay at the crystal boundary by pinning, so that more and more bubbles stay at the crystal boundary, thus interconnecting the bubbles, and finally releasing the fission gas into the fuel gas chamber through the connecting channels. However, bubbles and fission gas atoms also interact with defects in the crystal and are pinned by defects such as dislocations, clusters, nuclear transmutation impurities, which deprives of the migration ability of bubbles and traps them in the crystal, resulting in almost irreversible swelling of the fuel.",
                        "In order to cope with the swelling problem caused by fission gas, some pores are reserved at the stage of fuel manufacturing to contain the fission gas, and centre pores are reserved in the fuel to discharge the fission gas. However, with the increase of burnup, the pores are filled by fission products, and the pellets will gradually swell, resulting in the gradually shrinking and eventually disappearing of the central pores. The fission gas will be re-trapped inside the fuel, resulting in the continued swelling of fuel and very significant FCMI. Therefore, the high-burnup (25%-30%) metal fuel is designed to reduce the effective density to 55%, so that the fuel has a longer burnup section to withstand the conversion from open pores to closed pores. However, these measures can only alleviate the swelling caused by fission gas and prolong the burn-up, but cannot fundamentally solve the problem."

                        "The fuel is U-50% Zr alloy, and due to the extremely low neutron absorption cross section of Zr, the self-breeding of fast reactors loaded with high-burnup metal fuel can be realized even at such a low proportion of uranium. Due to the excellent irradiation and corrosion resistance of Zr, the high-Zr fuel itself has a lower swelling rate than the general fuel. In addition, due to the excellent mechanical properties of Zr, the mechanical properties of fuel are also quite good.",
                        "The release of fission gas is dependent on the migration of fission gas atoms and bubbles, and the high migration rate can accelerate the release of fission gas and reduce the swelling of fuel. However, the migration rate of fission gas is not only related to temperature, but also affected by irradiation, defects and the movement of fuel metal matrix atoms. During the phase transition, the fission gas migration can be promoted due to violent diffusion and migration of the atomic system. The reason why high-Zr alloy U-50% Zr is selected as the fuel is that, according to the U\u2014Zr phase diagram shown in FIG. 1, the U\u2014Zr alloy can change from \u03b4 to \u03b3 phase at 620\u00b0 C. in this ratio, and the spinodal decomposition can occur at 550\u00b0 C. in the chemical environment with fission gas and defects. In this ratio, there are only two phases in U\u2014Zr alloy.",
                        "At higher temperatures, the migration rate of fission gases is higher, which can promote the movement and release of bubbles. The short-range movement of atoms can exacerbate the movement of fission gas atoms and bubbles when phase transitions occur. After the phase transition to \u03b3 phase, the migration rate of bubbles and fission gas atoms in the \u03b3 phase is also relatively high, and this can further promote the release of fission gas. Therefore, the unique phase transition of high-Zr U\u2014Zr alloy at a certain temperature can be realized by manually controlling the temperature rise. The high randomness and rapid movement of atoms in the phase change process can be utilized in combination with high temperature to accelerate the migration and release of bubbles, so as to reduce the FCMI problem caused by the swelling of fission gas. After the fission gas is released, the temperature will be reduced, and the fuel phase will be converted into \u03b4 phase. This phase transition can remove the defects introduced by irradiation in the crystal, so that the fuel defect level will return to the initial level of the fuel, and continue the operation under normal conditions. The phase transition process in this step can also accelerate the migration of fission gas and promote the release.",
                        "After operating under normal conditions for a certain period of time, the natural uranium alloy U-50Zr realizes temperature rise control by power regulation. In case of ULOF (unprotected loss of flow) accident, the reactor core loaded with metal fuel will not have sodium boiling, because the negative feedback mechanism of the metal fuel itself makes its Doppler effect small. The ULOF test at 100% power without emergency shutdown on EBRII (experimental breeder fast reactor II) demonstrated that the reactor core loaded with metal fuel was automatically shut down without emergency shutdown measures and sodium was not boiling. In the ULOF test, the fuel temperature can reach 0.5-0.6Tm (Tm>1400K, representing the melting point of the fuel) of U-50Zr fuel, which is sufficient to cause phase transition from \u03b4 to \u03b3 phase. Therefore, the fuel temperature control can be realized through power regulation under the premise of safe operation, so as to promote periodic release of fission gas and periodic elimination of defects.",
