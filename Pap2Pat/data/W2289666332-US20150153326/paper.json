    "abstract": "Co ntact- de pendent i ntercellular t ransfer (codeIT) of cellular constituents can have functional consequences for recipient cells, such as enhanced survival and drug resistance. Pathogenic viruses, prions and bacteria can also utilize this mechanism to spread to adjacent cells and potentially evade immune detection. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this intercellular transfer process. Here, we present a novel microscopy-based screening method to identify regulators and cargo of codeIT. Single donor cells, carrying fluorescently labelled endocytic organelles or proteins, are co-cultured with excess acceptor cells. CodeIT is quantified by confocal microscopy and image analysis in 3D, preserving spatial information. An siRNA-based screening using this method revealed the involvement of several myosins and small GTPases as codeIT regulators. Our data indicates that cellular protrusions and tubular recycling endosomes are important for codeIT. We automated image acquisition and analysis to facilitate large-scale chemical and genetic screening efforts to identify key regulators of codeIT.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "In order to achieve sufficient amounts of transfer for screening, we needed to increase the amount of transfer compared to previous approaches. We reasoned that with increasing culture density, intercellular contact increases and thereby probably also the amount of contact-dependent transfer. Indeed, intercellular DiD transfer increased with higher culture density, up to confluence. We observed intercellular contact via several distinct types of structures, including nanotube-like connections and thicker protrusions underneath and on top of adjacent cells, and that codeIT of DiD occurred close to these sites (Fig. 1A). However, in confluent co-cultures with equal numbers of DiD-labelled donor cells and unlabelled acceptor cells, the ratio between codeIT and transfer through conditioned medium varied widely between experiments, with no reproducible dominance of one factor over the other. Taken together, codeIT was indistinguishable from transfer through the medium (Supplementary Fig. S1 online).",
                        "To circumvent this problem, we used a low ratio of DiD-stained donor to unstained acceptor cells in confluent culture, resulting in a reduction of the contribution of transfer through the medium. For better signal-exploitation and specificity, we evaluated codeIT microscopically, as described in the following. The use of the slowly migrating HeLa-Kyoto cell line confined DiD transfer to a restricted field. To demonstrate the dominance of contact-dependent over -independent transfer in our optimised co-culture protocol, we introduced intercellular gaps into our cell cultures. Therefore, alternating cell adhesive and non-adhesive stripes were stamped onto the substrate, thus restricting attachment of cells to adhesive stripes and preventing formation of protrusions spanning the non-adhesive gaps. This restricted the transfer of DiD in low-ratio (1:100) co-cultures to cells on the same side of the gap as the donor cell (Fig. 1B). Hence, DiD is a specific marker for codeIT in this configuration.",
                        "In our final screening protocol (Fig. 1C), we first cultured equal amounts of cells in two separate wells for 24\u2009h. For knockdown experiments, these wells were coated with siRNA. Thereafter, the cells in one well were stained with DiD to be used as codeIT donor cells. Subsequently, we diluted the donor cells and mixed them with unlabelled acceptor cells at a ratio of 1 donor per 400 acceptor cells. We chose dilution over sparser cultures to improve reproducibility and in order to keep culture conditions for donor and acceptor cells identical. The mix was then co-cultured on a glass-bottom plate for 22\u2009h prior to fixation, nuclear and plasma membrane (PM) staining, and microscopy and image analysis. Only regions containing single donor cells in a confluent lawn of acceptor cells were imaged to measure codeIT (Fig. 1D), while background, which includes transfer through the medium, was measured in images of adjacent areas that contain only acceptor cells and not donor cells (Fig. 1E). Both types of areas, those for analysing background and those for analysing codeIT, were required to be at least 200\u2009\u03bcm distant from any other donor cells. This prevented overlap of transfer patterns from multiple donor cells and as a result, codeIT could be attributed to specific donor cells. Doublets and groups of donor cells were excluded from the analysis, as well as small, rounded and partially detached donor cells, as they were assumed to be dying. Multi-nucleated donor cells were also excluded. Membrane staining with wheat-germ-agglutinin coupled to Alexa-Fluor-488 (WGA-AF-488) allowed automatic cell segmentation using CellSegm34. Subsequently, we quantified the DiD intensity in each cell by TransQuant, a software we programmed for this purpose (https://github.com/dominikfr/Transquant). This software recognises donor cells based on their high DiD intensity and control areas by the lack of a donor cell. The volume of the donor cell, based on the DiD signal and watershed volume from CellSegm, was dilated by one voxel to avoid falsely quantifying parts of the donor cell as transfer. DiD signal located inside acceptor cells was found based on the cell volumes defined by the cell segmentation. A threshold was set to eliminate signal due to autofluorescence, above which signal was considered to be intercellular transfer (Fig. 1F). Acceptor cells with a very small volume were automatically excluded by the software in order to avoid measuring increased auto-fluorescence of dead or dying cells as transfer. The results for each experiment were exported as a text file, easily readable by common software. The results showed, at 22\u2009h of co-culture, transfer intensity varied widely, with more cells with low amounts of transfer and few donor cells with high amounts of transfer (Fig. 2A,B). A log-transformation of the data resulted in normal distribution (Fig. 2C). The majority (>77%) of donor cells had transferred DiD above background (Fig. 2B). Transfer signal measured by this method differed not only from the background in amount, but also in density (Fig. 2D), suggesting different origins for the bulk of signal measured in background areas versus donor cell areas. The integrated signal intensity of the transfer originating from single donor cells did not correlate with the staining intensity of the respective donor cells (Fig. 2E). For the purpose of this quantification, the staining intensity of the donor cells was acquired with a lower detector voltage, resulting in images without large saturated areas."

The transferred material rearranges under cell division (Movie 1). Notably, DiD-stained protrusion bundles from donor cells oriented dynamically towards the bulk of transferred material, which localised to the perinuclear region in the acceptor cells (Movie 2).",
                        "In confocal 3D time-lapse, we followed the transfer of vesicles from the bulk donor cell signal into acceptor cells, where the vesicle moved towards the bulk of transferred DiD vesicles and stayed there (Movie 3). The observed transfer of DiD-stained structures in live-cell imaging and the dotted distribution in the acceptor cells are consistent with a transfer of DiD in larger complexes rather than diffusion of individual molecules."

                        "In order to investigate the mechanism underlying codeIT, we performed a pilot screening with siRNAs targeting 36 selected genes. For each target, three different siRNA sequences were transfected separately, each in three independent experiments, and compared to non-targeting control siRNA. Transfection with siRNAs was carried out using a reverse transfection protocol, i.e. plating cells on top of an siRNA-coated surface, as described previously35. For a list of all siRNAs used in the screening, see Supplementary Table S1 online. All cells were transfected twice: first, cells were plated onto siRNA coated plates 24\u2009h before co-culture, and then co-cultured on plates coated with siRNAs identical to those in the first transfection step. The reason for this was that single transfection of siRNA for only the first 24\u2009h was generally less efficient. After 22\u2009h of co-culture, fixation, staining and imaging, codeIT was quantified by TransQuant after cell segmentation by CellSegm (see methods). Several siRNAs clearly affected the amount of codeIT (Fig. 3B). Notably, only the volume, i.e. the number of voxels, but not the mean ratio of intensity/voxel of the codeIT signal deviated from the control value (e.g. siCDC42-3, which had the strongest effect in the screen; Fig. 3C). This was the case for all hit siRNAs (shown for the siRNAs with the strongest effects on codeIT, Fig. 3D)."

We stably expressed the respective EGFP-tagged proteins, including truncated proteins and point-mutants in HeLa-Kyoto cells and compared DiD transfer between those cells to control cells expressing only the EGFP-tag (Fig. 4).",
                        "EGFP-Myo10-tail significantly reduced codeIT, when expressed in both donors and acceptors or only in the donors, but not when expressed in the acceptor cells alone (Fig. 4A). EGFP-Cdc42-wild-type did not affect codeIT in either donors or acceptors or both. EGFP-Cdc42-G15A (nucleotide-free i.e. inactive mutant) and -Q61L (GTP-locked i.e. constitutively active mutant) significantly reduced codeIT, when both donors and acceptors expressed them, and when only donors expressed them. When expressed in the acceptors alone, no significant effect was measured (Fig. 4B). Neither EGFP-Rab11a-wild-type, nor -Q70L (GTP-locked i.e. constitutively active mutant) expression in both donors and acceptors decreased codeIT significantly; but -S25N (GDP-locked i.e. dominant negative mutant) caused a strong and significant reduction (Fig. 4C). Expressing -S25N only in donors or acceptors, respectively, also decreased codeIT, but not significantly. The results for -S25N are consistent with a synergistic effect of expression in donors and acceptors. Stably expressed EGFP-Rab35-S22N (GDP-locked i.e. dominant negative mutant) moderately reduced codeIT, while the wild-type and \u2013Q67L (GTP-locked i.e. constitutively active mutant) had no significant effects when expressed in both donor and acceptor cells (Fig. 4D). For example images see Supplementary Fig. S2 online.",
                        "To identify the transferred membrane compartment, we measured the transfer of a number of EGFP-tagged endosomal and plasma membrane marker proteins (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S3 online). Of those, EGFP-myosin-Vc-full length (Myo5c), EGFP-Myo10-tail, EGFP-Myo10-3xPH, EGFP-Rab5a, EGFP-Rab7a, EGFP-Rab8a, EGFP-Rab11a, farnesylated EGFP (farnesyl-EGFP, the C-terminal domain of K-Ras fused to EGFP) and GPI-anchored EGFP (EGFP-GPI) transferred significantly more than EGFP alone. EGFP-Rab35, the EGFP-tagged PH-domain of phospholipase C\u03b4 (PLC\u03b4-PH), which binds specifically to PI(4,5)P2, transferred even stronger. EGFP-Myo10-full length and heavy mero-Myo10 (Myo10-HMM), which contains the head and neck domains of Myo10, transferred the most. Contact-dependency of the transfer of EGFP-Myo10-HMM was confirmed by the same micro-patterning approach that has been described above (Supplementary Fig. S4 online).",
                        "Among the validated candidates affecting codeIT, only EGFP-Cdc42 did not transfer itself. We also could not detect transfer of the EGFP-EEA1-C-terminus (EEA1-CT), containing the PI3P-binding FYVE-domain, nor of a number of additional Rabs: EGFP-Rab1a, EGFP-Rab9a and EGFP-Rab7b, the trans-membrane proteins EGFP-E- and EGFP-N-Cadherin, and EGFP-Myo5c-tail. For the EGFP-2xFYVE construct, transfer was significantly higher than EGFP alone, but background levels were equally elevated (Table 1). For expression levels of all transfected constructs see Supplementary Table S2 online.",

In a related study, we also found that overexpression of EGFP-Rab8a-Q67L (GTP-locked i.e. constitutively active mutant) in HeLa cells increased the number of transferrin receptor positive nanotubes as well as the transfer of transferrin receptor (Anne Burtey, personal communication). Expression of EGFP-2xFYVE significantly increased both codeIT of DiD and background. No construct reduced codeIT of DiD with significance."

                "We present here a novel, microscopy-based method for automated quantification of codeIT. In our low-ratio confluent cell culture approach, codeIT is increased due to the larger contact area between cells, compared to commonly employed low-density approaches. Using a very low donor to acceptor cell ratio, the contribution of transfer through the medium was minimised and codeIT could be assigned to specific donor cells. Cells in image stacks were segmented by CellSegm34 in 3D. This enabled donor cell recognition and allowed integration of transfer intensity for each individual cell by our newly developed software TransQuant.",
                "The presented method is superior to quantification of intercellular transfer by flow cytometry in several aspects. It 1) excludes signal resulting from the uptake of apoptotic cells, 2) differentiates between signals from inside and outside acceptor cells, 3) assigns transfer events to specific donor cells and 4) monitors cell morphology, expression levels, spatial arrangement of cells and parameters of transferred material such as density, distribution and size. Automatic quantification allows for higher throughput and accuracy. Furthermore, it is less biased and labour-intensive than manual evaluation of confocal images.",
                "We applied this method with a pilot siRNA screen to study the mechanism of codeIT. We suggest a model integrating our results, shown in Fig. 6. The observed transfer characteristics of DiD are consistent with vesicle transfer rather than diffusion of molecules along a continuous membrane bridge. This is supported by the correlation of integrated intensity (sum of greyscale units of voxels) and volume (sum of voxels) of the transfer, which equally correlated for all siRNAs tested and control, even though the volume of codeIT differed between conditions. Hence, the density of each individual \u201cpackage\u201d is not affected but rather the total number or volume of packages that are transferred. If transfer occurred by diffusion along a continuous membrane bridge, the average transfer signal (e.g. DiD) intensity per voxel, which is the density, should change when the total transfer signal intensity is altered by siRNA knockdown. This did not happen, and therefore our data indicates transfer in packages, which change their volume or number upon siRNA knockdown. Such an effect would arise from directly transferred vesicles (Fig. 3C,D). This is in accordance with our observation of transfer of endosomal marker proteins.",
                "We measured the intercellular transfer of various fluorescently-tagged proteins to gain insight into the transferred compartment (Table 1). Several proteins associated with the PM did transfer, i.e. EGFP-Myo10-tail, EGFP-Myo10-3xPH domains (binding to PI-(3,4,5)-P3), EGFP-PLC\u03b4-PH (binding to PI-(3,4)-P2, as does Myo6, a hit in our screen), EGFP-GPI, f-EGFP and EGFP-Rab35. In contrast, other proteins with at least partial PM-localisation did not transfer, i.e. EGFP-Cdc42-wild-type and -Q61L, EGFP-E-Cadherin and -N-Cadherin. Additionally, we detected transfer of proteins that predominantly localise to the early, recycling, tubular and late endosomes, i.e. EGFP-Rab5a, EGFP-Rab11a, EGFP-Rab8a, EGFP-Rab7a and EGFP-Myo5c, while marker proteins of other membrane compartments, such as Rab1a and Rab9a, did not transfer. In accordance with this, it has been reported recently that prion aggregates co-localise with markers of early, recycling and late endosomes inside nanotubes36. Since the transferred PM-associated proteins reportedly also localise to organelles, we hypothesize that the bulk of codeIT does not originate from the PM, but rather from intracellular membranes, likely one or several compartments of the endocytic pathway. In favour of this hypothesis, the bulk of the DiD signal in both donor and acceptor cells localises to the perinuclear region, while the PM stains weakly in comparison. A part of codeIT may also originate from specific domains of the PM, enriched in phosphatidyl inositol phosphate (PI-P)s, such as protrusion tips. Alternatively, a specific sorting or gating mechanism could exclude certain molecules from being transferred, and enrich for others.",
                "Interestingly, EGFP-2xFYVE, a marker of both early and late endosomes, binding to PI3-P, transferred more than EGFP alone, but led also to increased EGFP signal in control regions. Additionally, EGFP-2xFYVE expression increased the DiD signal intensity in control areas. This indicates that a different, contact-independent mode of transfer, possibly involving secretion of exosomes, is increased by expression of EGFP-2xFYVE. Furthermore, this case shows that our system also detects increases in contact-independent transfer.",
                "Several known regulators of organelle transfer were confirmed by quantification with our method. Among our tested candidates, Myo10-full length and -HMM (lacking the membrane binding tail) transferred themselves the most. Both localize specifically to the tips of cell protrusions such as filopodia and nanotube-like structures3738, suggesting that protrusions promote codeIT, even in confluent cultures. The truncation mutant Myo10-tail, lacking the motor domain, was shown to inhibit Myo10 function in phagocytosis39. Notably, the Myo10-tail only inhibited codeIT when expressed in donors but not in acceptors (Fig. 4A). This demonstrates that our assay is able to differentiate if the candidate protein is involved in codeIT in the donor or the acceptor cell. It also shows that Myo10-mediated phagocytosis is probably not involved in codeIT. In FACS studies of comparatively low-density cultures of CAD cells expressing the same truncated Myo10 variants, Gousset et al. found that only Myo10-full length but not -HMM enhanced DiD transfer. They suggested that both tail and motor are needed for transfer38. However, using our method, both Myo10-full length and -HMM increased codeIT and were transferred themselves. Therefore, the tail domain might not be necessary for transfer, but needed to bridge longer distances by nanotubes as needed in a low-density culture setup. Alternatively, the differences might be cell-type specific.",
                "Previously, mutant Cdc42 was shown to abrogate M-Sec-induced nanotube formation in HeLa cells40. In our assay, Cdc42 mutants inhibited codeIT specifically in donor cells (Fig. 4B), similar to Myo10-tail. Interestingly, both the GTP-locked Q61L active mutant and the non-nucleotide-binding G12A inactive mutant showed identical effects. This suggests that active cycling of Cdc42 between the inactive and active state is needed for the promotion of codeIT, likely via its ability to remodel F-actin and initiate the formation of protrusions41. While Cdc42-knockdown reduced codeIT, transfer of EGFP-Cdc42 itself was not detected. These findings point towards an upstream regulatory role for Cdc42 rather than direct involvement in the transfer mechanism. Cdc42 also acts upstream of Myo10 in promoting transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes42. Additionally, the authors of a recent publication conclude that codeIT of mCherry between senescent cells is dependent on Cdc42-regulated actin-polymerization43.",
                "We also identified specific Rab proteins as potential regulators of codeIT. Contrary to Myo10 and Cdc42 mutants, the observed effect of EGFP-Rab11a-S25N (inactive mutant) was much stronger when expressed in both donor and acceptor cells than when expressed unilaterally, consistent with a synergistic effect (Fig. 4C). We propose that Rab11a, a recycling endosome regulator4445, could be synergistically involved in both donors and acceptors. One known role of Rab11a is the transport of cell-cell adhesion molecules to the PM46, which are possibly needed on both sides of the transfer site to establish tight contact. Another interesting screen hit is VAMP4, which has been shown to provide membrane material for a specific kind of fast growing protrusion47 and could in a similar way act in the formation of the protrusions mediating codeIT.",
                "Rab35, a known marker of tubular endosomes48, transfers itself the most of all tested endocytic markers. Additionally, Rab35-S22N (inactive mutant) expression reduced codeIT significantly (Fig. 4D). Rab35 could be involved in the mechanism underlying codeIT in several alternative or combined ways. Rab35 has been shown to co-localise with both F-actin and fascin. It is involved in the regulation of actin remodelling by determining the sites where F-actin polymerization occurs495051. Likely via this role and/or by the transport of Rho GTPases52, Rab35 initiates the formation of filopodia5253545556, which are known precursors of nanotubes. Finally, Rab35 is also important for the trafficking of cadherins to the plasma membrane57, their stabilization in adherens junctions58 and thus possibly in the anchoring of nanotubes to target cells.",
                "Intriguingly, knockdown of the early endosomal marker Rab5a reduced codeIT while knockdown of EEA1, a known Rab5a-antagonist59, enhanced it. Rab5 regulates several fusion events in the intracellular membrane systems and Rab5-positive compartments host hepatitis C virus60, Listeria monocytogenes61 and Trypanosoma cruzi62, known to spread directly from cell to cell, thereby evading the immune system. Myo10 has been implicated in the intercellular spreading of Shigella flexneri63. Additionally, HIV spreads faster from cell to cell via nanotubes than via the classical extracellular pathway in vitro24. This highlights a possible involvement of codeIT in unconventional spreading of intracellular pathogens. Insights into the codeIT mechanism could lead to novel treatments for infectious diseases. We also show the involvement of codeIT in oncogenic H-Ras transfer, an important target for anti-cancer drugs.",
                "Our screening approach provides a basis for further investigations to elucidate the mechanism and physiological role of codeIT. This method is suited for any fluorescently labelled molecule or structure, including pathogens. The automated image acquisition and analysis may be adapted for high-throughput chemical and genetic screening approaches and drug testing."

                        "Cell segmentation and quantification of transfer: All algorithms for segmentation and automated analysis were written in MATLAB. The cell segmentation was done with CellSegm which was published previously72 and included the pre-processing step of anisotropic filtering, marker generation, watershed segmentation and classification of the watershed regions into background or cells. After watershed segmentation, the transfer of signal was analysed with TransQuant, which can be downloaded (https://github.com/dominikfr/Transquant). The algorithm automatically detects a DiD donor cell by high signal intensity. In absence of any donor cell, the stack is marked as a control stack. Small objects with a volume of less than 1,000\u2009\u03bcm3 are discarded during donor cell definition. To fill all internal holes of the cell representations after thresholding, the images are then morphologically closed with a structural element of the two pixels. If both DiD and EGFP channels exist in a stack, the union of the cell representations from both channels is computed as approximation to the donor cell. The watershed segmented cell with the highest overlap to this approximation is then added to the donor cell as the union (with an OR operator). For a control condition where no donor cell is present, the watershed cell with the centre of mass closest to the image centre is used as donor cell. The detected donor cell is dilated with a structural element of radius (1,1,1; i.e. with one voxel in all directions) to ensure that there is no signal in the acceptor cells, which spatially belongs to the donor cell. Images for transfer analysis are defined as DiD or GFP channel. Signal above the global threshold (100 of 256 grayscale intensities for DiD, 100 or 160 of 256 for EGFP) was quantified as a read-out for transfer within the computed cell borders. The signal contained in non-donor cells was defined as intercellular transfer. Signal above the global threshold outside of cells was defined as unspecific transfer and was not counted as intracellular transfer. For signal quantification of transfer, the volume occupied by the donor cell definition is blanked (i.e. not counted). All watershed cells touching the boundary of the image and watershed cells with a volume below 100\u2009\u03bcm3 were removed from the remaining analysis, assuming the low volume is an indication of dead cells. The transferred signal within each cell is measured in terms of total volume of binarised signal as well as integrated signal intensity as a sum of grey scale values within the binarised signal volume, i.e. within the same area. The numbers from the analysis program were exported to a text file, and then imported into Excel for statistical analysis."

This transformation yielded a normal distribution (Test for normality: Chi-square test, Fig. 2C). All statistical tests used to detect differences between experimental conditions were performed on this transformed data. For multiple comparisons, ANOVA was used to test if significant differences exist between the datasets, followed by post-hoc Dunnett\u2019s test to identify the different dataset. For single comparisons, e.g. transfer compared to background in one respective condition, 2-sided Student\u2019s t-test was used. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Waiting job: is an empty job without defined parameters that has to be set after each well. First, all wells are marked as low resolution job and one scan field after each horizontal line of wells is marked as a Waiting job. The autofocus map is started manually. After completion of the autofocus map, the low resolution job is started from MATLAB via DonorFind. The waiting job after each horizontal line of wells has the function as a trigger to start pattern analysis by DonorFind. DonorFind then finds all donor cells and excludes those where other donor cells are located within 200\u2009\u03bcm surrounding distance. Further requirements were a cell density of at least 15 nuclei within a 200\u2009\u03bcm radius. These donor cells are listed for high resolution imaging. Furthermore, if possible, it finds up to 15 random positions without any previously defined donor cell, but with corresponding distance requirements met, as for the donor cells, and without spatial overlap with any other chosen high-resolution field. DonorFind thereafter starts high resolution jobs at all calculated donor and control positions. After the high resolution job is accomplished for the first line of wells, the procedure is repeated for the next line of wells."
