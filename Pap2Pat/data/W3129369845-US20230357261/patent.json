                        "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease of premature infants that is characterized by the acute onset of inflammation and necrosis of the intestine, leading eventually to overwhelming sepsis and death. More than 5,000 babies in the U.S. alone are afflicted with NEC and more than 50,000 premature babies born each year in the U.S. are at risk of developing NEC. The cost to the U.S. health care system to care for this population is approximately $2 billion per year. There is currently, however, no effective treatment for NEC and no effective preventive strategy.",
                        "NEC develops in the setting of prematurity, formula feeds and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and over a third of affected patients die from the disease. In seeking to understand the pathogenesis of NEC, it has been shown that exaggerated signaling of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in NEC development. TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation."

                        "The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates, in part, that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in mice and human tissue can inhibit TLR4 signaling, and thus serve to dampen inflammation in the gut. The finding that AHR activation could inhibit TLR4 signaling led to a search for novel AHR agonists that could be used as therapeutics for NEC. To this end, the AHR analogue \u201cA18\u201d, which had been identified and sold commercially as the proton pump inhibitor \u201cLansoprazole,\u201d was identified as an AHR agonists. The administration of lansoprazole, i.e., A18, effectively prevented and treated NEC in mouse models, and dampened inflammation in the intestine of human resected at the time of surgery for NEC.",
                        "Analogues of A18 were then synthesized and developed. A total of 235 analogues were tested in mouse enteroid cell lines. One compound in particular, referred to herein as compound 169, was identified that activated AHR and significantly inhibited TLR4 signaling in the gut. The current technology seeks to prevent or treat inflammatory conditions that affect children, most notably necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).",
                        "Importantly, it is shown that A18 can be administered to pregnant mothers (mice) to treat NEC in the premature pups. This observation suggests that compound C169 could potentially be administered as a gut protective agent for the fetus when administered to the mother in the event of premature labor. C169 could potentially solve the problem of necrotizing enterocolitis, the leading cause of death in premature infants from gastrointestinal disease, for which there is no specific treatment and no cure. The induction of NEC is always related to the provision of infant formula, as breast milk is highly protective. There is no formula that is NEC protective. Accordingly, the presently disclosed compounds could be developed into a drug for treating NEC and/or an agent that could be added to infant formula to prevent NEC."

                                "The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.",
                                "Certain compounds of the present disclosure can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. Certain compounds of the present disclosure may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present disclosure and are intended to be within the scope of the present disclosure.",
                                "In addition to salt forms, the present disclosure provides compounds, which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present disclosure. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present disclosure by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present disclosure when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.",
                                "The term \u201cprotecting group\u201d refers to chemical moieties that block some or all reactive moieties of a compound and prevent such moieties from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed, for example, those moieties listed and described in T. W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. John Wiley & Sons (1999). It may be advantageous, where different protecting groups are employed, that each (different) protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions allow differential removal of such protecting groups. For example, protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and tert-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as tert-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.",
                                "Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.",
                                "Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a palladium(O)-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.",

Current dogma suggests that NEC develops in response to postnatal dietary and bacteriologic exposure, and in utero factors remain largely unexplored. Without wishing to be bound to any one particular theory, it is thought that maternal-fetal signaling plays a role in the development of NEC, and that there exists a window of opportunity in utero to prevent this disease. To test this hypothesis, the presently disclosed subject matter focuses on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that recognizes environmental and dietary ligands to induce immune protection.",
                                "To this end, the presently disclosed subject matter, in some embodiments, demonstrates that administration of a diet to pregnant mice that is rich in the AHR ligand indole-3-carbinole (I3C) can prevent NEC in the offspring, and that AHR signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium prevents NEC by curtailing the extent of TLR4 signaling in the newborn gut. The presently disclosed subject matter also shows that breast milk\u2014a maternal-derived tissue with strong anti-NEC effects\u2014prevents NEC by activating AHR on the newborn gut and reducing TLR4 signaling.",
                                "More particularly, NEC protection required AHR activation on the intestinal epithelium to reduce intestinal TLR4, did not require AHR activation on leukocytes (as revealed in Ahr\u0394IEC, Ahr\u2212/\u2212, Ahr\u0394lys) and did not require IL-22 (as revealed in Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice). Mice and humans with NEC revealed reduced intestinal AHR, explaining their predisposition to disease development. Finally, using a screen of clinically relevant compounds, an AHR ligand was identified that can activate AHR and limit TLR4 in human tissue, and prevent NEC in mice when administered during pregnancy. Taken together, these findings establish a critical link between maternal-fetal AHR signaling and NEC prevention, offer a novel way to prevent NEC by administering A18 during pregnancy, and highlight a role for AHR in the pathogenesis and treatment of this devastating disease.",

Neu and Walker, 2011; Hackam et al., 2019. NEC develops in the setting of prematurity, formula feeds and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and over a third of affected patients die from the disease. Flahive et al., 2020.",

TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature, as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium, Sodhi et al., 2012, Gribar et al., 2014, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation. Afrazi et al., 2014; Hackam and Sodhi, 2018.",

Jin et al., 2019; Underwood, 2018. There is emerging evidence to question this dogma, however, and to raise the possibility that NEC also may reflect an in utero process, and by extension, to suggest that interventions in the prenatal period could prevent NEC development. For example, NEC occurs more frequently and with greater severity in babies who are born after in utero bacterial infection, Ogunyemi et al., 2003; Duci et al., 2019, while certain maternal diets have been linked to reduced premature birth, Englund-Ogge et al., 2014; Saunders et al, 2014, which is the biggest risk factor for NEC.

                                "Whether activation of AHR during pregnancy could prevent NEC in newborn mice was initially investigated. The experimental design for this investigation is shown in FIG. 1a. Supplementation of the maternal diet with the AHR ligand indole-3-carbinol (I3C) throughout pregnancy induced the expression of the AHR response gene Cyp1a1 in the small intestine of both the mother (FIG. 1B) and the fetus at e17.5 (FIG. 1c), confirming that AHR activation had occurred in both the mother and fetus. The continuation of administration of I3C to the lactating mother induced Cyp1a1 expression in suckling pups at p11 (FIG. 1d).",
                                "To determine whether maternal AHR administration could prevent NEC, either I3C or a control diet was administered to mice during pregnancy and lactation, and then induced NEC in the pups using a well-validated model, Good et al., 2015; Sodhi et al., 2018, that induces patchy intestinal necrosis, which closely mimics the human disease (see Methods Section 1.7 herein below). As shown in FIG. 1e-FIG. 1i, the oral administration of I3C during pregnancy significantly reduced the severity of experimental NEC in the pups, as manifest by reduced histological injury (FIG. 1e-FIG. 10, reduced expression of 116 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 1g), and reduced intestinal epithelial apoptosis (FIG. 1h-FIG. 1i).",
                                "Next, to determine whether maternal-derived AHR ligands were present in tissues to which the developing fetus would be exposed, amniotic fluid, breast milk, and serum were harvested from pregnant mice that had been administered either I3C or a control diet, which was then incubated with IEC-6 enterocytes to assess for AHR activation. As shown in FIG. 1j-FIG. 1l, exposure of each of these maternal-derived biological fluids significantly increased the expression of Cyp1a1 in cultured IEC-6 enterocytes, indicating that each maternal derived fluid contains AHR ligands.",
                                "Next, whether the maternal administration of I3C could blunt TLR4 signaling in the pup intestine was investigated, given the critical importance of TLR4 signaling to NEC pathogenesis. Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Hackam et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2014. As shown in FIG. 1m, maternal administration of I3C significantly reduced the induction of the proinflammatory cytokine 116 in the neonatal (p11) mouse intestine in response to the specific TLR4 ligand LPS, as compared to pups from non I3C-treated mothers, supporting a protective effect of maternal AHR activation. Taken together, these findings reveal that maternal delivery of AHR ligands to the fetus can prevent the development of NEC, prompting us to examine AHR signaling in the newborn mice.",

                                "To examine how the administration of AHR ligands during pregnancy can prevent NEC, AHR expression in the intestine in humans, mice and piglets with and without NEC was explored. As shown in FIG. 2, the expression of AHR was significantly reduced in the intestine of infants with NEC as compared with control infants (FIG. 2a-FIG. 2c), and also was reduced in the intestinal mucosa of mice that were induced to develop NEC (FIG. 2d-FIG. 2f), and in an experimental model of NEC in premature piglets (FIG. 2g-FIG. 2i), suggesting a universal response that is not specific for one species. To test whether a lack of AHR signaling was a cause and not a consequence of NEC, NEC was induced in mice from which Ahr globally (Ahr\u2212/\u2212) had been deleted, or specifically from the intestinal epithelium (Ahr\u0394IEC) or the myeloid compartment (Ahr\u0394lys). Confirmation of cell-specific Ahr deletion in each strain is shown in FIG. 7.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 2, Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice developed significantly more severe NEC than wild-type mice, as determined by higher histologic grade (FIG. 2j-FIG. 2k) and higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokine gene Tnfa (FIG. 2l). Importantly, AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium as opposed to leukocytes was required for the protection from NEC in these studies, as Ahr\u0394IEC mice had more severe higher grade of NEC compared to wild-type or Ahr\u0394lys mice (FIG. 2j-FIG. 2l), both of which express AHR on the intestinal epithelium (as seen in FIG. 7).",
                                "Based on the above findings, whether feeding neonatal mice an AHR ligand could reduce NEC severity was explored. To do so, an AHR-ligand rich infant diet was developed by supplementing the infant formula with I3C, Kiss et al., 2011, which was then administered to pups in our mouse NEC model (FIG. 3a). As shown in FIG. 3b, I3C administration induced the expression Cyp1a1 in the neonatal intestinal epithelium of wildtype and Ahr\u0394lys mice, but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212, and to a lesser degree in Ahr\u0394IEC mice, confirming the appropriate activation of the AHR pathway in the neonatal gut. Importantly, I3C supplementation significantly reduced the severity of NEC in wild-type mice (FIG. 3a, FIG. 3c), but had relatively scant protective effect in either Ahr\u0394IEC or no protective effect in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 3a, FIG. 3c), confirming that AHR activation in the intestinal epithelium by I3C is required for protection against NEC. In an important control, I3C supplementation continued to exert a moderate protective effect when administered to Ahr\u0394lys mice, which still express AHR on the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 3a, FIG. 3c). For these experiments, the corresponding breast fed controls maintain a normal histology, as shown in FIG. 8.",

                                "To investigate potential mechanisms by which AHR activation in the neonatal intestinal epithelium can reduce NEC severity, other systems in which AHR activation has been shown to play a protective role were investigated. Specifically, AHR signaling critically regulates the mucosal Th17 and ILC3 lymphocyte populations, each of which are sources of IL-22, Schiering et al., 2017, thus accounting for the essential role of IL-22 in mediating the protective effect of AHR in other models. To investigate whether IL-22 was required for the protection by AHR against NEC as determined in FIG. 2, I3C was administered and then NEC was induced in Il22\u2212/\u2212 mice. As shown in FIG. 9, I3C supplementation induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 9a) and reduced NEC severity (FIG. 9b and FIG. 9c), illustrating that IL-22 was not required for the protective effects of AHR activation on NEC. Consistent with this finding, in the early postnatal period in which NEC is induced, it was observed that Th17 (FIG. 9d) and ILCs (FIG. 9e-FIG. 9g) were found to be rare populations in the intestinal mucosa, a finding supported by others. Egan et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015.",
                                "In further consideration of the protective mechanisms by which AHR activation can reduce NEC, the possibility that AHR activation could regulate tight junction expression and intestinal barrier integrity was considered, as has been shown by others in older mice. Singh et al., 2019. No difference was found, however, in the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in the newborn ileum (FIG. 9h) or intestinal permeability after oral gavage of labelled dextran (FIG. 9i), making it unlikely that the effects of AHR activation can be attributed to barrier integrity. Based upon these studies, and given that TLR4 plays a critical role in NEC pathogenesis, Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Hackam et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2014, the possibility that AHR activation could reduce TLR4 signaling or expression in the neonatal intestinal epithelium was investigated.",

                                "To directly investigate whether AHR activation could limit TLR4 signaling in the intestinal epithelium, studies were first performed in primary enteroids derived from both wild-type and Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 4a). Treatment of enteroids with I3C induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in wild-type, but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212 enteroids (FIG. 4b), confirming that AHR is appropriately activated on intestinal epithelial cells.",
                                "Importantly, I3C significantly reduced the LPS-mediated induction of Tnfa in wild-type, but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212 enteroids (FIG. 4c), consistent with a reduction in TLR4 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. In seeking to understand whether I3C could inhibit intestinal Tlr4 in vivo, wild-type p11 mice were fed a diet rich in I3C, which induced Cyp1a1 expression in their intestinal epithelium (FIG. 4d) and significantly reduced TLR4 signaling, as manifest by reduced LPS-induced Tnfa expression (FIG. 4e), which was accompanied by reduced expression of Tlr4 in the intestinal mucosa (FIG. 4f). I3C administration did not induce Cyp1a1 (FIG. 4d) and did not reduce either TLR4 signaling (FIG. 4e) or Tlr4 expression (FIG. 40 in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice, confirming the specificity of the I3C effect. In gaining insights into how AHR activation could reduce Tlr4 expression, it is noted that I3C significantly upregulated the expression in the ileum of microRNAs that are known to negatively regulate Tlr4 expression, namely miR-146b, miR-223 and let-7i in wild type mice, He et al., 2014, while I3C did not increase the expression of these microRNAs in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 4g-FIG. 4i).",
                                "To assess whether AHR activation could reduce TLR4 signaling in human intestine, we next treated intestinal explant cultures derived from freshly resected intestinal samples from premature infants undergoing surgery for NEC, with both LPS and I3C. As shown in FIG. 4j-FIG. 4k, I3C treatment of human intestinal cultures induced the expression of Cyp1a1, revealing activation of AHR in human tissue, and also reduced TLR4 signaling, as revealed by reduced LPS-induced Tnf-a expression (FIG. 4k). Taken together, these findings indicate that AHR activation inhibits TLR4 signaling and expression in the intestinal epithelium. Given the findings that maternal-fetal signaling can regulate NEC, as well as the observation in FIG. 1 that breast milk can induce the AHR downstream gene Cyp1a1, whether AHR signaling could explain in part the protective effects of breast milk for NEC was then explored.",

These findings were extended to examine whether breast milk\u2014which is by definition rich in maternal-derived ligands\u2014could activate AHR in the intestinal mucosa of the pup, and thus reduce TLR4 signaling and prevent NEC. To test this possibility directly, enteroids were harvested from the ilea of wild-type and Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice, and then treated with LPS in the presence or absence of human breast milk. As shown in FIG. 5a, treatment of wild-type enteroids with breast milk activated AHR, as revealed by induction of Cyp1a1, a finding not seen in either saline-treated or Ahr\u2212/\u2212 enteroids, and revealing that breast milk is enriched in maternally-derived AHR ligands.",
                                "Importantly, breast milk reduced TLR4 signaling in enteroids in an AHR-dependent manner (FIG. 5b), as indicated by the significant reduction in LPS-induced Tnfa expression in wild-type but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212 enteroids after breast milk treatment. TLR4-induced apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium is an important feature of mouse and human NEC, Leaphart et al., 2007; Neal et al., 2012, leading to next assess whether breast milk could prevent TLR4-induced apoptosis in enteroids via AHR. As shown in FIG. 5c-FIG. 5d, LPS significantly increased enterocyte apoptosis in wildtype enteroids, and the degree of induction was reduced after treatment with breast milk, a protective effect that was absent in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 enteroids (FIG. 5c-FIG. 5d). Breast milk also required AHR to inhibit TLR4 signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium, as the oral administration of breast milk to mice that had been maintained without oral feeds for 3 hours induced the expression Cyp1a1 and significantly reduced LPS-induced 116 expression in the intestinal mucosa of wild-type but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 5e).",
                                "To assess whether the protective effects of breast milk for NEC required AHR, infant formula was supplemented with human breast milk and a reduction in NEC severity in wild-type mice was observed (FIG. 5g), but almost no protection by breast milk on NEC in Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice (FIG. 5h), as revealed by no reduction in histology and severity score (FIG. 5g-FIG. 5h), or the expression of iNos (FIG. 5i), or Tlr4 (FIG. 5j). Taken together, these findings reveal that maternally-derived factors secreted into the breast milk can reduce TLR4 signaling and attenuate NEC in the offspring. Whether these observations could be exploited therapeutically was investigated next, including a search for novel AHR agonists that could prevent NEC after maternal administration.",

The lead compound, shown in FIG. 6b, is a 369KDa molecule with the formula C16H14F3N3O2S, herein called \u201cA18,\u201d which induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in IEC-6 enterocytes (FIG. 6c) and in the intestinal epithelium when fed to wild-type, but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212 newborn mice (FIG. 6d) confirming its role as a specific AHR ligand.",
                                "Importantly, feeding A18 to mice significantly reduced TLR4-induced 116 expression (FIG. 6e), and reduced Tlr4 expression in the newborn ileum (FIG. 60, providing further confirmation of the ability of AHR to limit TLR4 in the neonatal gut. Further, A18 administration significantly reduced NEC severity when administered orally to wild-type but not Ahr\u2212/\u2212 mice, as manifest by improved histology (FIG. 6g), improved NEC severity score (FIG. 6h), and reduced expression of I16 (FIG. 6j). The potential clinical relevance of A18 was found as the ex vivo treatment of human intestine obtained from infants undergoing surgery with A18 significantly induced Cyp1a1 expression (FIG. 6j), confirming its ability to activate AHR in human tissue, and significantly reduced LPS-induced Tnf-a expression (FIG. 6k) and Tlr4 expression (FIG. 6l), consistent with the findings in mice (FIG. 6e).",

As shown in FIG. 6m, the administration of A18 during pregnancy induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the offspring pup intestine, and also significantly reduced NEC severity as manifest by reduced Tnf-a (FIG. 6n) and Tlr4 expression (FIG. 6o) in the neonatal gut, and improved histology and NEC severity (FIG. 6p-q). Taken together, these results suggest a surprising role for maternal-fetal AHR signaling in NEC, and raise the possibility that A18 can serve as a novel agent that can be administered either during pregnancy or postnatally for the prevention and treatment of this devastating disease.",

                                "The persistently high mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis, Han et al., 2020, reveals both a lack of a sufficient understanding of its pathogenesis, and an urgency to approach the disease differently. This study sheds light on the possibility that NEC arises from reduced AHR signaling in the intestinal epithelium of the premature infant and shows that AHR ligands may be passed from mother to infant\u2014both during pregnancy via the fetal circulation, and in the postnatal period through the breast milk\u2014where they can attenuate the severity of this disease. The mechanism by which AHR activation in the intestinal epithelium attenuates NEC severity involves a reduction in signaling and expression of the innate immune receptor TLR4, whose expression is elevated in the premature bowel as compared with the full term bowel, Gribar et al., 2014; Sodhi et al., 2012, and whose activation on the intestinal epithelium has been shown to be critical for NEC development. Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Egan et al., 2016. The therapeutic potential of the current findings was revealed by the identification of the AHR ligand A18 to prevent NEC when fed to mice during pregnancy, and by showing its ability to reduce TLR4 signaling in human bowel ex vivo. In view of the fact that NEC almost always develops in the absence of breast milk and the presence of formula feeds, Nino et el, 2016, these findings suggest the possibility that the development of NEC may reflect impaired AHR signaling in the neonatal intestine, and also show that strategies to enhance the delivery of AHR ligands either directly to the neonate, or secondarily through the mother, may offer new strategies for the prevention or treatment of NEC.",
                                "Previous authors have shown AHR to be a gatekeeper for the availability of AHR ligands in the intestinal immune system, Schiering et al. 2017, from either microbial or dietary origin, Brawner et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2018, and a critical link between AHR, dietary factors and intestinal immunity has been proposed. Shinde and McGaha, 2018. The current studies now reveal that AHR signaling on leukocytes is dispensable for the protective role of AHR against NEC, in favor of AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium. This observation is distinct from a large body of work that reveals that the activation of AHR on leukocytes is required for the maintenance of Th17 and ILC3 cells in the intestinal mucosa, Kiss et al., 2011; Veldhoen et al., 2008, leading to AHR-mediated protection from colitis through IL-22 release. Monteleone et al., 2011.",
                                "Differences between those studies and our own may lie in the fact that Th17 and ILC3 cells are rare in the neonatal intestinal mucosa at the time points in which NEC develops. Chen et al., 2015; Egan et al., 2016. It is noteworthy that intestinal AHR signaling also has been linked to the release of antimicrobial peptides, Kiss et al., 2011, and to increased differentiation of secretory cells, Alvarado et al, 2019, processes, which are both downstream of TLR4 activation in the gut, Sodhi et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014, and thus consistent with the current work. Without wishing to be bound to any one particular theory, it is thought that that differences between the current work and prior studies also reveal unique features of NEC, including differences in the location of disease along the gastrointestinal tract (NEC is an ileal disease while colitis affects the colon), age (NEC occurs in the newborn period whereas these other models occur in older mice), as well as differences in microbial ligands which may be present in models of colitis versus NEC, and which could activate AHR.",
                                "One of the most translationally relevant findings of the current study is the identification of an AHR ligand that can prevent NEC, either when offered orally during pregnancy (FIG. 6m-q), or when administered directly to the neonatal pups (FIG. 6g-i). As revealed from its chemical structure in FIG. 6b, the AHR ligand A18 belongs to the benzimidazole class of proton pump inhibitors, which also includes omeprazole. Yang et al., 2016. These FDA-approved drugs are currently in clinical use for hyperacidity diseases, and could be conceivably repurposed for NEC, just as they have been repositioned as anticancer therapeutics. Jin et al., 2014. The identification of the heterocylic A18 as a potent AHR substrate reflects the broad range of hydrophobic structural motifs that bind to the AHR. Gutierrez-Vazquez and Quintana, 2018.",
                                "In seeking to understand the chemical mechanism of AHR binding so as to develop novel analogues for clinical use, it is noted that the indole nucleus is a privileged ligand for AHR, Denison and Faber, 2017, suggesting that the benzimidazole core of A18 is the main pharmacophore for AHR activation. Major limits of A18 for clinical use in preventing NEC include the fact that while A18 is rapidly absorbed and approximately 97% bound in human plasma, it is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C18, and plasma elimination half-life is only approximately 2 h in humans, Landes et al., 1995, leaving much room for further improvement. Moreover, acid reduction therapy has been linked to an increase in NEC when administered to premature neonates, Alganabi et al., 2019, indicating that A18 will need to be modified in order to enhance its AHR signaling but reduce its effects on gastric acidity.",
                                "The current findings may have direct impact on clinical medicine. First, these finding have shown that NEC may not only be a disease of the postnatal period, but may also reflect impaired maternal-fetal signaling through AHR. Second, these finding also have provided important insights into how breast milk may protect against NEC, by revealing its ability to activate AHR on the neonatal intestinal epithelium, where it can attenuate TLR4 signaling. But perhaps of most significance is the opportunity to interfere with the molecular pathways that lead to the development of NEC through the intra-partum oral delivery of AHR ligands including I3C or A18. If confirmed in clinical studies, these findings may offer the unique ability to intervene in the setting of premature labor, by administering an AHR ligand that could serve to protect the gut and reduce the risk of NEC development in the neonate. In support of the possible success of a strategy in which antenatal delivery of AHR ligands may protect the neonate, it is noteworthy that pregnant women who adhered to a Mediterranean diet\u2014which is rich in AHR ligands\u2014were found to have significantly less necrotizing enterocolitis than mothers who did not adhere to a Mediterranean diet. Parlapani et al., 2019. Taken in aggregate, the current finds offer the prospect of a renewed approach to NEC, and perhaps finally to a chance to alter the trajectory of this devastating disease.",

                                "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease of premature infants that is characterized by the acute onset of inflammation and necrosis of the intestine, leading eventually to overwhelming sepsis and death. NEC develops in the setting of prematurity, formula feeds and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and over a third of affected patients die from the disease. In seeking to understand the pathogenesis of NEC, we and others have shown that exaggerated signaling of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in NEC development. TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation. The Hackam group has discovered that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in mice and human tissue can inhibit TLR4 signaling, and thus serve to dampen inflammation in the gut.",
                                "The finding that AHR activation could inhibit TLR4 signaling therefore led us to search for novel AHR agonists that could be used as therapeutics for NEC. To this end, Hackam and coworkers identified the AHR analogue \u201cA18\u201d, which had been identified and sold commercially as the proton pump inhibitor \u201cLansoprazole\u201d. The administration of lansoprazole effectively prevented and treated NEC in mouse models, and dampened inflammation in the intestine of human resected at the time of surgery for NEC. Analogues of A18 were then synthesized and developed. A total of 235 analogues were tested in mouse enteroid cell lines, and a \u201chit\u201d, referred to herein as compound 169, was identified that activated AHR, and significantly inhibited TLR4 signaling in the gut.",
                                "The presently disclosed subject matter identifies compound #169 as an AHR agonist with the ability to inhibit TLR4 in the gut, and, pending in vivo analysis, to thus serve as a novel agent for the prevention and treatment of NEC. A computational similarity search based on A18 was conducted in an in-house library. Hundreds of structures were initially identified, binned, and selected for further investigation. Subsequent screens identified analogs, such as compound 169, as well as other structures referred to as #243 and #247. Subsequently, an SAR studies was conducted and representative compounds disclosed herein were prepared.",
                                "Importantly, it has been shown that A18 can be administered to pregnant mothers (mice) to treat NEC in the premature pups. This observation suggests that #169, and other identified analogs, could potentially be administered as a gut protective agent for the fetus when administered to the mother in the event of premature labor.",

All glassware and stir bars were dried in an oven for at least 3 h prior to use. Reactions run in microwave vials were sealed with Teflon 20-mm septa and crimped to ensure atmosphere exclusion. When necessary, degassed solvents were prepared by sparging with N2 for 1 h. Reactions were monitored by TLC analysis (pre-coated silica gel 60 F254) and spots were visualized (UV lamp 254 nm and 365 nm). Purifications by chromatography were performed with SiO2 (230-400 mesh) on a Teledyne ISCO system with reusable cartridges and monitored at 254 and 280 nm. Reverse phase chromatography was performed on a Biotage Isolera system with C18-SiO2 cartridges and monitored 200-400 nm. 1H/13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance, 300/75 MHz, Bruker Avance 400/100 MHz or Bruker Avance 500/125 MHz instruments.",

The finding that AHR activation could inhibit TLR4 signaling led to a search for novel AHR agonists that could be used as therapeutics for NEC. To this end, the AHR analogue \u201cA18\u201d, which had been identified and sold commercially as the proton pump inhibitor \u201cLansoprazole,\u201d was identified as an AHR agonist. The administration of lansoprazole, i.e., A18, effectively prevented and treated NEC in mouse models, and dampened inflammation in the intestine of human resected at the time of surgery for NEC.",

Compound #169, and other structures, referred to herein as compound #243 and compound #247, activated AHR signaling (FIG. 15a) and significantly inhibited TLR4 signaling (FIG. 15b) as indicated by attenuated Tnf-a induction by TLR4 ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse enteroids.",

As shown in FIG. 16a, administration of 20 mg/kg/day of compound #247 significantly induced the expression of Cyp1a1, a hallmark of AHR activation, while administration of 20 mg/kg/day of compound #169 or compound #243 did not induce the expression of Cyp1a1 in vivo. Administration of compound #169, compound #243, or compound #247, however, did not reduce the severity of NEC, as manifested by similar expression of IL-1b, IL-6, Tnf-a and Lcn2 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 16b-FIG. 16e) and reduced histological injury (FIG. 16f-FIG. 16j).",
