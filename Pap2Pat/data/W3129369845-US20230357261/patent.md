# DESCRIPTION

## FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT

This invention was made with government support under DK117186 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

## BACKGROUND

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease of premature infants that is characterized by the acute onset of inflammation and necrosis of the intestine, leading eventually to overwhelming sepsis and death. More than 5,000 babies in the U.S. alone are afflicted with NEC and more than 50,000 premature babies born each year in the U.S. are at risk of developing NEC. The cost to the U.S. health care system to care for this population is approximately $2 billion per year. There is currently, however, no effective treatment for NEC and no effective preventive strategy.

NEC develops in the setting of prematurity, formula feeds and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and over a third of affected patients die from the disease. In seeking to understand the pathogenesis of NEC, it has been shown that exaggerated signaling of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in NEC development. TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The presently disclosed subject matter now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which some, but not all embodiments of the inventions are shown. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. The presently disclosed subject matter may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Indeed, many modifications and other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated Figures. Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.

I. Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Ligands and their Analogues for the Prevention and Treatment of Inflammatory Disorders

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates, in part, that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in mice and human tissue can inhibit TLR4 signaling, and thus serve to dampen inflammation in the gut. The finding that AHR activation could inhibit TLR4 signaling led to a search for novel AHR agonists that could be used as therapeutics for NEC. To this end, the AHR analogue “A18”, which had been identified and sold commercially as the proton pump inhibitor “Lansoprazole,” was identified as an AHR agonists. The administration of lansoprazole, i.e., A18, effectively prevented and treated NEC in mouse models, and dampened inflammation in the intestine of human resected at the time of surgery for NEC.

Analogues of A18 were then synthesized and developed. A total of 235 analogues were tested in mouse enteroid cell lines. One compound in particular, referred to herein as compound 169, was identified that activated AHR and significantly inhibited TLR4 signaling in the gut. The current technology seeks to prevent or treat inflammatory conditions that affect children, most notably necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).

Importantly, it is shown that A18 can be administered to pregnant mothers (mice) to treat NEC in the premature pups. This observation suggests that compound C169 could potentially be administered as a gut protective agent for the fetus when administered to the mother in the event of premature labor. C169 could potentially solve the problem of necrotizing enterocolitis, the leading cause of death in premature infants from gastrointestinal disease, for which there is no specific treatment and no cure. The induction of NEC is always related to the provision of infant formula, as breast milk is highly protective. There is no formula that is NEC protective. Accordingly, the presently disclosed compounds could be developed into a drug for treating NEC and/or an agent that could be added to infant formula to prevent NEC.

### B. Methods of Treatment

In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method for treating or preventing or reducing the risk of an inflammatory disorder associated with a reduced expression of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in a subject in need of treatment thereof, the method comprising administering to the subject one or more AHR agonists comprising a compound of formula (I-III), compound #169, which has the following structure:

or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, to activate the AHR, thereby treating or preventing or reducing the risk of the inflammatory disorder.

Inflammatory disorders include a large number of disorders or conditions that are involved in a variety of diseases, including those involving the immune system, including those demonstrated in allergic reactions and myopathies, or non-immune diseases with causal origins in inflammatory processes including, but not limited to cancer, atherosclerosis, and ischemic heart disease. Non-limiting examples of disorders associated with inflammation include, but are not limited to, acne vulgaris, asthma, autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory diseases, celiac disease, chronic prostatitis, diverticulitis, glomerulonephritis, hidradenitis suppurativa, hypersensitivities, inflammatory bowel diseases, interstitial cystitis, otitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, reperfusion injury, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, transplant rejection, and vasculitis.

More particularly, the presently disclosed subject matter may be used to treat any disease or disorder involving AHR activation, including, but not limited to, inflammatory disorders, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diseases, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, cardiovascular disease, ocular Behcet's disease, breast cancer, and others.

In particular embodiments, the inflammatory disorder is necrotizing enterocolitis.

As used herein, an agonist is an agent that binds to a receptor, e.g., AHR, and activates the receptor to produce a biological response.

The “subject” treated by the presently disclosed methods in their many embodiments is desirably a human subject, although it is to be understood that the methods described herein are effective with respect to all vertebrate species, which are intended to be included in the term “subject.” Accordingly, a “subject” can include a human subject for medical purposes, such as for the treatment of an existing condition or disease or the prophylactic treatment for preventing the onset of a condition or disease, or an animal subject for medical, veterinary purposes, or developmental purposes. Suitable animal subjects include mammals including, but not limited to, primates, e.g., humans, monkeys, apes, and the like; bovines, e.g., cattle, oxen, and the like; ovines, e.g., sheep and the like; caprines, e.g., goats and the like; porcines, e.g., pigs, hogs, and the like; equines, e.g., horses, donkeys, zebras, and the like; felines, including wild and domestic cats; canines, including dogs; lagomorphs, including rabbits, hares, and the like; and rodents, including mice, rats, and the like. An animal may be a transgenic animal. In some embodiments, the subject is a human including, but not limited to, fetal, neonatal, infant, juvenile, and adult subjects. Further, a “subject” can include a patient afflicted with or suspected of being afflicted with a condition or disease. Thus, the terms “subject” and “patient” are used interchangeably herein. The term “subject” also refers to an organism, tissue, cell, or collection of cells from a subject.

In some embodiments, the subject is a human subject. In particular embodiments, the subject is an infant. As used herein, the term “infant” can refer to a child from about one month after birth to one year after birth and can include a child up to about two years after birth.

As used herein, the term “newborn” or “neonate” refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth, and can be an infant only a few hours after birth, a few days after birth, or up to a month after birth. The term applies generally to premature, full term (e.g., 38 weeks and beyond), and post mature infants.

In yet more particular embodiments, the human subject is a premature infant. As used herein; the term “premature birth” or “preterm birth” refers to the birth of a baby at fewer than 37 weeks gestational age and can include babies born at 37 weeks, 36 weeks, 35 weeks, 34 weeks, 33 weeks, 32 weeks, 31 weeks, 30 weeks, 29 weeks, 28 weeks, 27 weeks, 26 weeks, 25 weeks, 24 weeks, 23 weeks, 22 weeks, 21 weeks, and 20 weeks gestational age.

As used herein, “treatment” includes, without limitation, (1) decreasing the level of one or more index of inflammation (e.g., inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-113); (2) decreasing a clinical marker of inflammation, such as S100a8, Lcn2, iFabp, leukocyte count, fever, hypotension; and/or (3) reducing the risk of an adverse outcome, such as death, organ failure, hypoxia, or the need for surgery. “Treatment” does not necessarily mean that the condition being treated will be cured. A “therapeutically effective amount” of an AMR agonist achieves treatment.

“Reducing the risk” or “reducing the severity of does not necessarily mean that the subject being treated will not develop NEC. A “prophylactically effective amount” for preventing NEC reduces the risk of NEC by at least about ⅕ or by at least about ⅓. Any infant may be eligible for such prophylactic treatment. Infants at higher risk for NEC as a result of premature birth or low birth rate may particularly benefit, as well as a term infant otherwise at risk for NEC

Further, “methods of preventing” are defined as methods which reduce the risk of developing the disease, and do not necessarily result in 100% prevention of the disease. As such, these methods, applied prophylactically to an infant, may not only reduce the risk, but may also reduce the severity of the disease if it does occur. By definition, such preventative methods may be administered to an infant having no signs of preexisting NEC as well as to an infant which is exhibiting one or more early clinical sign consistent with NEC but in which a definitive diagnosis of NEC has not been established.

In some embodiments, the administration is enteral administration. As used herein, the term “enteral administration” includes feeding or drug administration through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Enteral administration can include oral administration or gastric administration, for example, via a feeding tube through the nasal passage, i.e., a nasogastric (NG) tube, or a feeding tube leading directly (the stomach, i.e., a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

In general, the “effective amount” of an active agent or drug delivery device refers to the amount necessary to elicit the desired biological response. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of an agent or device may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the agent to be delivered, the makeup of the pharmaceutical composition, the target tissue, and the like.

The term “combination” is used in its broadest sense and means that a subject is administered at least two agents, more particularly a compound of formula (I-III), and/or compound #169, and one or more therapeutic agents. More particularly, the term “in combination” refers to the concomitant administration of two (or more) active agents for the treatment of a, e.g., single disease state. As used herein, the active agents may be combined and administered in a single dosage form, may be administered as separate dosage forms at the same time, or may be administered as separate dosage forms that are administered alternately or sequentially on the same or separate days. In one embodiment of the presently disclosed subject matter, the active agents are combined and administered in a single dosage form. In another embodiment, the active agents are administered in separate dosage forms (e.g., wherein it is desirable to vary the amount of one but not the other). The single dosage form may include additional active agents for the treatment of the disease state.

In some embodiments, the one or more therapeutic agents comprise one or more AHR agonists. In some embodiments, the one or more AHR agonists is selected from the group consisting of abacavir, abacavir sulfate, amlexanox, anagrelide hydrochloride, benzocaine (ethyl p-aminobenzoate), bromindione, catharanthine, dexlansoprazole, eseroline, febuxostat, helenien (xantofyl palmitate), hydralazine hydrochloride, indoprofen, ipratropium bromide, lansoprazole, menadione sodium bisulfate, nitazoxanide, omeprazole, phenazopyridine, phenazopyridine hydrochloride, primaquine, rabeprazole sodium, tenatoprazole, tranilast (sb 252218), and ziprasidone hydrochloride, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), A18, or derivatives and combinations thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

Further, the compounds of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 described herein can be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the compounds of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169, facilitate administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increase inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like, including other active ingredients. Advantageously, such combination therapies utilize lower dosages of the conventional therapeutics, thus avoiding possible toxicity and adverse side effects incurred when those agents are used as monotherapies.

The timing of administration of a compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 and at least one additional therapeutic agent can be varied so long as the beneficial effects of the combination of these agents are achieved. Accordingly, the phrase “in combination with” refers to the administration of a compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 and at least one additional therapeutic agent either simultaneously, sequentially, or a combination thereof. Therefore, a subject administered a combination of a compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 and at least one additional therapeutic agent can receive compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 and at least one additional therapeutic agent at the same time (i.e., simultaneously) or at different times (i.e., sequentially, in either order, on the same day or on different days), so long as the effect of the combination of both agents is achieved in the subject.

When administered sequentially, the agents can be administered within 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 minutes or longer of one another. In other embodiments, agents administered sequentially, can be administered within 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 or more days of one another. Where the compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 and at least one additional therapeutic agent are administered simultaneously, they can be administered to the subject as separate pharmaceutical compositions, each comprising either a compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 or at least one additional therapeutic agent, or they can be administered to a subject as a single pharmaceutical composition comprising both agents.

When administered in combination, the effective concentration of each of the agents to elicit a particular biological response may be less than the effective concentration of each agent when administered alone, thereby allowing a reduction in the dose of one or more of the agents relative to the dose that would be needed if the agent was administered as a single agent. The effects of multiple agents may, but need not be, additive or synergistic. The agents may be administered multiple times.

In some embodiments, when administered in combination, the two or more agents can have a synergistic effect. As used herein, the terms “synergy,” “synergistic,” “synergistically” and derivations thereof, such as in a “synergistic effect” or a “synergistic combination” or a “synergistic composition” refer to circumstances under which the biological activity of a combination of a compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 and at least one additional therapeutic agent is greater than the sum of the biological activities of the respective agents when administered individually.

Synergy can be expressed in terms of a “Synergy Index (SI),” which generally can be determined by the method described by F. C. Kull et al., Applied Microbiology 9, 538 (1961), from the ratio determined by:

Qa/QA+Qb/QB=Synergy Index(SI)

wherein:


- - Q_(A) is the concentration of a component A, acting alone, which
    produced an end point in relation to component A;
  - Q_(a) is the concentration of component A, in a mixture, which
    produced an end point;
  - Q_(B) is the concentration of a component B, acting alone, which
    produced an end point in relation to component B; and
  - Q_(b) is the concentration of component B, in a mixture, which
    produced an end point.

Generally, when the sum of Qa/QA and Qb/QB is greater than one, antagonism is indicated. When the sum is equal to one, additivity is indicated. When the sum is less than one, synergism is demonstrated. The lower the SI, the greater the synergy shown by that particular mixture. Thus, a “synergistic combination” has an activity higher that what can be expected based on the observed activities of the individual components when used alone. Further, a “synergistically effective amount” of a component refers to the amount of the component necessary to elicit a synergistic effect in, for example, another therapeutic agent present in the composition.

### E. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration

In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a pharmaceutical composition including one compound of formula (I-III) and/or compound #169 alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. One of skill in the art will recognize that the pharmaceutical compositions include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described above. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are generally well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and include salts of active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituent moieties found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present disclosure contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent or by ion exchange, whereby one basic counterion (base) in an ionic complex is substituted for another. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt.

When compounds of the present disclosure contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent or by ion exchange, whereby one acidic counterion (acid) in an ionic complex is substituted for another. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al, “Pharmaceutical Salts”, Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present disclosure contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.

Accordingly, pharmaceutically acceptable salts suitable for use with the presently disclosed subject matter include, by way of example but not limitation, acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bitartrate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, citrate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, pamoate (embonate), pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate, tannate, tartrate, or teoclate. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be found in, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed.) Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2000).

In therapeutic and/or diagnostic applications, the compounds of the disclosure can be formulated for a variety of modes of administration, including systemic and topical or localized administration. Techniques and formulations generally may be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed.) Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2000).

Depending on the specific conditions being treated, such agents may be formulated into liquid or solid dosage forms and administered systemically or locally. The agents may be delivered, for example, in a timed- or sustained-slow release form as is known to those skilled in the art. Techniques for formulation and administration may be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed.) Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2000). Suitable routes may include oral, buccal, by inhalation spray, sublingual, rectal, transdermal, vaginal, transmucosal, nasal or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intra-articular, intra-sternal, intra-synovial, intra-hepatic, intralesional, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections or other modes of delivery.

For injection, the agents of the disclosure may be formulated and diluted in aqueous solutions, such as in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For such transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.

Use of pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers to formulate the compounds herein disclosed for the practice of the disclosure into dosages suitable for systemic administration is within the scope of the disclosure. With proper choice of carrier and suitable manufacturing practice, the compositions of the present disclosure, in particular, those formulated as solutions, may be administered parenterally, such as by intravenous injection. The compounds can be formulated readily using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art into dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the compounds of the disclosure to be formulated as tablets, pills, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject (e.g., patient) to be treated.

For nasal or inhalation delivery, the agents of the disclosure also may be formulated by methods known to those of skill in the art, and may include, for example, but not limited to, examples of solubilizing, diluting, or dispersing substances, such as saline; preservatives, such as benzyl alcohol; absorption promoters; and fluorocarbons.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present disclosure include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. Determination of the effective amounts is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. Generally, the compounds according to the disclosure are effective over a wide dosage range. For example, in the treatment of adult humans, dosages from 0.01 to 1000 mg, from 0.5 to 100 mg, from 1 to 50 mg per day, and from 5 to 40 mg per day are examples of dosages that may be used. A non-limiting dosage is 10 to 30 mg per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration, the form in which the compound is administered, the subject to be treated, the body weight of the subject to be treated, the bioavailability of the compound(s), the adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) toxicity of the compound(s), and the preference and experience of the attending physician.

In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. The preparations formulated for oral administration may be in the form of tablets, dragees, capsules, or solutions.

Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC), and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP: povidone). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.

Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dye-stuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.

Pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin, and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols (PEGs). In addition, stabilizers may be added.

### F. Definitions

Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this presently described subject matter belongs.

While the following terms in relation to compounds of formula (I-III) are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the following definitions are set forth to facilitate explanation of the presently disclosed subject matter. These definitions are intended to supplement and illustrate, not preclude, the definitions that would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the present disclosure.

The terms substituted, whether preceded by the term “optionally” or not, and substituent, as used herein, refer to the ability, as appreciated by one skilled in this art, to change one functional group for another functional group on a molecule, provided that the valency of all atoms is maintained. When more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. The substituents also may be further substituted (e.g., an aryl group substituent may have another substituent off it, such as another aryl group, which is further substituted at one or more positions).

Where substituent groups or linking groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., —CH2O— is equivalent to —OCH2—; —C(═O)O— is equivalent to —OC(═O)—; —OC(═O)NR— is equivalent to —NRC(═O)O—, and the like.

When the term “independently selected” is used, the substituents being referred to (e.g., R groups, such as groups R1, R2, and the like, or variables, such as “m” and “n”), can be identical or different. For example, both R1 and R2 can be substituted alkyls, or R1 can be hydrogen and R2 can be a substituted alkyl, and the like.

The terms “a,” “an,” or “a(n),” when used in reference to a group of substituents herein, mean at least one. For example, where a compound is substituted with “an” alkyl or aryl, the compound is optionally substituted with at least one alkyl and/or at least one aryl. Moreover, where a moiety is substituted with an R substituent, the group may be referred to as “R-substituted.” Where a moiety is R-substituted, the moiety is substituted with at least one R substituent and each R substituent is optionally different.

A named “R” or group will generally have the structure that is recognized in the art as corresponding to a group having that name, unless specified otherwise herein. For the purposes of illustration, certain representative “R” groups as set forth above are defined below.

Descriptions of compounds of the present disclosure are limited by principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, where a group may be substituted by one or more of a number of substituents, such substitutions are selected so as to comply with principles of chemical bonding and to give compounds which are not inherently unstable and/or would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art as likely to be unstable under ambient conditions, such as aqueous, neutral, and several known physiological conditions. For example, a heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a ring heteroatom in compliance with principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art thereby avoiding inherently unstable compounds.

Unless otherwise explicitly defined, a “substituent group,” as used herein, includes a functional group selected from one or more of the following moieties, which are defined herein:

The term hydrocarbon, as used herein, refers to any chemical group comprising hydrogen and carbon. The hydrocarbon may be substituted or unsubstituted. As would be known to one skilled in this art, all valencies must be satisfied in making any substitutions. The hydrocarbon may be unsaturated, saturated, branched, unbranched, cyclic, polycyclic, or heterocyclic. Illustrative hydrocarbons are further defined herein below and include, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, allyl, vinyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, ethynyl, cyclohexyl, and the like.

The term “alkyl,” by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched chain, acyclic or cyclic hydrocarbon group, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent groups, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C1-10 means one to ten carbons, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 carbons). In particular embodiments, the term “alkyl” refers to C1-20 inclusive, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 carbons, linear (i.e., “straight-chain”), branched, or cyclic, saturated or at least partially and in some cases fully unsaturated (i.e., alkenyl and alkynyl) hydrocarbon radicals derived from a hydrocarbon moiety containing between one and twenty carbon atoms by removal of a single hydrogen atom. In particular embodiments, the alkyl group comprises a C1-C6 alkyl group, including up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbon atoms.

Representative saturated hydrocarbon groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, sec-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, sec-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl, dodecyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, and homologs and isomers thereof.

“Branched” refers to an alkyl group in which a lower alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, is attached to a linear alkyl chain. “Lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl group having 1 to about 8 carbon atoms (i.e., a C1-8 alkyl), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 carbon atoms. “Higher alkyl” refers to an alkyl group having about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms, e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 carbon atoms. In certain embodiments, “alkyl” refers, in particular, to C1-8 straight-chain alkyls. In other embodiments, “alkyl” refers, in particular, to C1-8 branched-chain alkyls.

Alkyl groups can optionally be substituted (a “substituted alkyl”) with one or more alkyl group substituents, which can be the same or different. The term “alkyl group substituent” includes but is not limited to alkyl, substituted alkyl, halo, arylamino, acyl, hydroxyl, aryloxyl, alkoxyl, alkylthio, arylthio, aralkyloxyl, aralkylthio, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, oxo, and cycloalkyl. There can be optionally inserted along the alkyl chain one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms, wherein the nitrogen substituent is hydrogen, lower alkyl (also referred to herein as “alkylaminoalkyl”), or aryl.

Thus, as used herein, the term “substituted alkyl” includes alkyl groups, as defined herein, in which one or more atoms or functional groups of the alkyl group are replaced with another atom or functional group, including for example, alkyl, substituted alkyl, halogen, aryl, substituted aryl, alkoxyl, hydroxyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, sulfate, cyano, and mercapto.

The term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or heteroatoms or a cyclic hydrocarbon group having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms or heteroatoms, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, —CH2—CH2—O—CH3, —CH2—CH2—NH—CH3, —CH2—CH2—N(CH3)—CH3, —CH2—S—CH2—CH3, —CH2—CH2—S(O)—CH3, —CH2—CH2—S(O)2—CH3, —CH═CH—O—CH3, —Si(CH3)3, —CH2—CH═N—OCH3, —CH═CH—N(CH3)— CH3, O—CH3, —O—CH2—CH3, and —CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, —CH2—NH—OCH3 and —CH2—O—Si(CH3)3.

As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as —C(O)NR′, —NR′R″, —OR′, —SR, —S(O)R, and/or —S(O2)R′. Where “heteroalkyl” is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and —NR′R″ are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term “heteroalkyl” should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like.

“Cyclic” and “cycloalkyl” refer to a non-aromatic mono- or multicyclic ring system of about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms, e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl group can be optionally partially unsaturated. The cycloalkyl group also can be optionally substituted with an alkyl group substituent as defined herein, oxo, and/or alkylene. There can be optionally inserted along the cyclic alkyl chain one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms, wherein the nitrogen substituent is hydrogen, unsubstituted alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, or substituted aryl, thus providing a heterocyclic group. Representative monocyclic cycloalkyl rings include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl. Multicyclic cycloalkyl rings include adamantyl, octahydronaphthyl, decalin, camphor, camphane, and noradamantyl, and fused ring systems, such as dihydro- and tetrahydronaphthalene, and the like.

The term “cycloalkylalkyl,” as used herein, refers to a cycloalkyl group as defined hereinabove, which is attached to the parent molecular moiety through an alkylene moiety, also as defined above, e.g., a C1-20 alkylene moiety. Examples of cycloalkylalkyl groups include cyclopropylmethyl and cyclopentylethyl.

The terms “cycloheteroalkyl” or “heterocycloalkyl” refer to a non-aromatic ring system, unsaturated or partially unsaturated ring system, such as a 3- to 10-member substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl ring system, including one or more heteroatoms, which can be the same or different, and are selected from the group consisting of nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si), and optionally can include one or more double bonds.

The cycloheteroalkyl ring can be optionally fused to or otherwise attached to other cycloheteroalkyl rings and/or non-aromatic hydrocarbon rings. Heterocyclic rings include those having from one to three heteroatoms independently selected from oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, in which the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. In certain embodiments, the term heterocylic refers to a non-aromatic 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring or a polycyclic group wherein at least one ring atom is a heteroatom selected from O, S, and N (wherein the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may be optionally oxidized), including, but not limited to, a bi- or tri-cyclic group, comprising fused six-membered rings having between one and three heteroatoms independently selected from the oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, wherein (i) each 5-membered ring has 0 to 2 double bonds, each 6-membered ring has 0 to 2 double bonds, and each 7-membered ring has 0 to 3 double bonds, (ii) the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may be optionally oxidized, (iii) the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized, and (iv) any of the above heterocyclic rings may be fused to an aryl or heteroaryl ring. Representative cycloheteroalkyl ring systems include, but are not limited to pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, indolinyl, quinuclidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, thiadiazinanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, and the like.

The terms “cycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkyl”, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of “alkyl” and “heteroalkyl”, respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. The terms “cycloalkylene” and “heterocycloalkylene” refer to the divalent derivatives of cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.

An unsaturated hydrocarbon has one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. Alkyl groups which are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed “homoalkyl.”

More particularly, the term “alkenyl” as used herein refers to a monovalent group derived from a C2-20 inclusive straight or branched hydrocarbon moiety having at least one carbon-carbon double bond by the removal of a single hydrogen molecule. Alkenyl groups include, for example, ethenyl (i.e., vinyl), propenyl, butenyl, 1-methyl-2-buten-1-yl, pentenyl, hexenyl, octenyl, allenyl, and butadienyl.

The term “cycloalkenyl” as used herein refers to a cyclic hydrocarbon containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Examples of cycloalkenyl groups include cyclopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadiene, cyclohexenyl, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, cycloheptenyl, cycloheptatrienyl, and cyclooctenyl.

The term “alkynyl” as used herein refers to a monovalent group derived from a straight or branched C2-20 hydrocarbon of a designed number of carbon atoms containing at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. Examples of “alkynyl” include ethynyl, 2-propynyl (propargyl), 1-propynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, and heptynyl groups, and the like.

The term “alkylene” by itself or a part of another substituent refers to a straight or branched bivalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group derived from an alkyl group having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 carbon atoms. The alkylene group can be straight, branched or cyclic. The alkylene group also can be optionally unsaturated and/or substituted with one or more “alkyl group substituents.” There can be optionally inserted along the alkylene group one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms (also referred to herein as “alkylaminoalkyl”), wherein the nitrogen substituent is alkyl as previously described. Exemplary alkylene groups include methylene (—CH2—); ethylene (—CH2—CH2—); propylene (—(CH2)3—); cyclohexylene (—C6H10); —CH═CH—CH═CH—; —CH═CH—CH2—; —CH2CH2CH2CH2—, —CH2CH═CHCH2—, —CH2CsCCH2—, —CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2—, —(CH2)q-N(R)—(CH2)r—, wherein each of q and r is independently an integer from 0 to about 20, e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, and R is hydrogen or lower alkyl; methylenedioxyl (—O—CH2—O—); and ethylenedioxyl (—O—(CH2)2—O—). An alkylene group can have about 2 to about 3 carbon atoms and can further have 6-20 carbons. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being some embodiments of the present disclosure. A “lower alkyl” or “lower alkylene” is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.

The term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent group derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, —CH2—CH2—S—CH2—CH2— and —CH2—S—CH2—CH2—NH—CH2—. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms also can occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxo, alkylenedioxo, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula —C(O)OR′— represents both —C(O)OR′— and —R′OC(O)—.

The term “aryl” means, unless otherwise stated, an aromatic hydrocarbon substituent that can be a single ring or multiple rings (such as from 1 to 3 rings), which are fused together or linked covalently. The term “heteroaryl” refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms (in each separate ring in the case of multiple rings) selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. The terms “arylene” and “heteroarylene” refer to the divalent forms of aryl and heteroaryl, respectively.

For brevity, the term “aryl” when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the terms “arylalkyl” and “heteroarylalkyl” are meant to include those groups in which an aryl or heteroaryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl, furylmethyl, and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like). However, the term “haloaryl,” as used herein is meant to cover only aryls substituted with one or more halogens.

Where a heteroalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or heteroaryl includes a specific number of members (e.g. “3 to 7 membered”), the term “member” refers to a carbon or heteroatom.

Further, a structure represented generally by the formula:

as used herein refers to a ring structure, for example, but not limited to a 3-carbon, a 4-carbon, a 5-carbon, a 6-carbon, a 7-carbon, and the like, aliphatic and/or aromatic cyclic compound, including a saturated ring structure, a partially saturated ring structure, and an unsaturated ring structure, comprising a substituent R group, wherein the R group can be present or absent, and when present, one or more R groups can each be substituted on one or more available carbon atoms of the ring structure. The presence or absence of the R group and number of R groups is determined by the value of the variable “n,” which is an integer generally having a value ranging from 0 to the number of carbon atoms on the ring available for substitution. Each R group, if more than one, is substituted on an available carbon of the ring structure rather than on another R group. For example, the structure above where n is 0 to 2 would comprise compound groups including, but not limited to:

and the like.

A dashed line () representing a bond in a structure indicates that the bond can be either present or absent. For example, a dashed line representing a bond in a cyclic ring structure indicates that the ring structure is selected from the group consisting of a saturated ring structure, a partially saturated ring structure, and an unsaturated ring structure. A dashed line in an alkylene group indicates that the group is an alkylene group or an alkylene group comprising a double bond.

The symbol () denotes the point of attachment of a moiety to the remainder of the molecule.

When a named atom of an aromatic ring or a heterocyclic aromatic ring is defined as being “absent,” the named atom is replaced by a direct bond.

Each of above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “heteroalkyl,” “cycloalkyl, and “heterocycloalkyl”, “aryl,” “heteroaryl,” “phosphonate,” and “sulfonate” as well as their divalent derivatives) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated group. Optional substituents for each type of group are provided below.

Substituents for alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl monovalent and divalent derivative groups (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: —OR′, ═O, ═NR′, ═N—OR′, —NR′R″, —SR′, -halogen, —SiR′R″R′″, —OC(O)R′, —C(O)R′, —CO2R′, —C(O)NR′R″, —OC(O)NR′R″, —NR″C(O)R′, —NR′—C(O)NR″R′″, —NR″C(O)OR′, —NR—C(NR′R″)═NR′″, —S(O)R′, —S(O)2R′, —S(O)2NR′R″, —NRSO2R′, —CN, CF3, fluorinated C1-4 alkyl, and —NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m′+1), where m′ is the total number of carbon atoms in such groups. R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ each may independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. As used herein, an “alkoxy” group is an alkyl attached to the remainder of the molecule through a divalent oxygen. When a compound of the disclosure includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R′″, R″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R′ and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF3 and —CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH3, —C(O)CF3, —C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).

All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present disclosure, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure.

The compounds of the present disclosure may exist as salts. The present disclosure includes such salts. Examples of applicable salt forms include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (e.g. (+)-tartrates, (−)-tartrates or mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures, succinates, benzoates and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid. These salts may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in art. Also included are base addition salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present disclosure contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent or by ion exchange. Examples of acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like.

Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present disclosure by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present disclosure when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.

The term “protecting group” refers to chemical moieties that block some or all reactive moieties of a compound and prevent such moieties from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed, for example, those moieties listed and described in T. W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. John Wiley & Sons (1999). It may be advantageous, where different protecting groups are employed, that each (different) protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions allow differential removal of such protecting groups. For example, protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and tert-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as tert-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.

Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.

Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a palladium(O)-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.

Typical blocking/protecting groups include, but are not limited to the following moieties:

**1.2 Overview**

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an often-fatal disease of premature infants that is characterized by acute necrosis of the intestine which requires activation of intestinal toll like receptor 4 (TLR4). Current dogma suggests that NEC develops in response to postnatal dietary and bacteriologic exposure, and in utero factors remain largely unexplored. Without wishing to be bound to any one particular theory, it is thought that maternal-fetal signaling plays a role in the development of NEC, and that there exists a window of opportunity in utero to prevent this disease. To test this hypothesis, the presently disclosed subject matter focuses on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that recognizes environmental and dietary ligands to induce immune protection.

To this end, the presently disclosed subject matter, in some embodiments, demonstrates that administration of a diet to pregnant mice that is rich in the AHR ligand indole-3-carbinole (I3C) can prevent NEC in the offspring, and that AHR signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium prevents NEC by curtailing the extent of TLR4 signaling in the newborn gut. The presently disclosed subject matter also shows that breast milk—a maternal-derived tissue with strong anti-NEC effects—prevents NEC by activating AHR on the newborn gut and reducing TLR4 signaling.

More particularly, NEC protection required AHR activation on the intestinal epithelium to reduce intestinal TLR4, did not require AHR activation on leukocytes (as revealed in AhrΔIEC, Ahr−/−, AhrΔlys) and did not require IL-22 (as revealed in Il22−/− mice). Mice and humans with NEC revealed reduced intestinal AHR, explaining their predisposition to disease development. Finally, using a screen of clinically relevant compounds, an AHR ligand was identified that can activate AHR and limit TLR4 in human tissue, and prevent NEC in mice when administered during pregnancy. Taken together, these findings establish a critical link between maternal-fetal AHR signaling and NEC prevention, offer a novel way to prevent NEC by administering A18 during pregnancy, and highlight a role for AHR in the pathogenesis and treatment of this devastating disease.

**1.3 Background**

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease of premature infants that is characterized by the acute onset of inflammation and necrosis of the intestine, leading eventually to overwhelming sepsis and death. Neu and Walker, 2011; Hackam et al., 2019. NEC develops in the setting of prematurity, formula feeds and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and over a third of affected patients die from the disease. Flahive et al., 2020.

In seeking to understand the pathogenesis of NEC, the inventors' Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Werts et al., 2019, and others, Jilling et al., 2006; Fawley et al., 2017, have shown that exaggerated signaling of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, Sodhi et al., 2012, plays a critical role in NEC development. TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature, as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium, Sodhi et al., 2012, Gribar et al., 2014, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation. Afrazi et al., 2014; Hackam and Sodhi, 2018.

Current dogma suggests that NEC develops in response to dietary and bacteriologic factors that are present in the postnatal period, which explains why all preventive strategies have so far been targeted after birth. Jin et al., 2019; Underwood, 2018. There is emerging evidence to question this dogma, however, and to raise the possibility that NEC also may reflect an in utero process, and by extension, to suggest that interventions in the prenatal period could prevent NEC development. For example, NEC occurs more frequently and with greater severity in babies who are born after in utero bacterial infection, Ogunyemi et al., 2003; Duci et al., 2019, while certain maternal diets have been linked to reduced premature birth, Englund-Ogge et al., 2014; Saunders et al, 2014, which is the biggest risk factor for NEC. Neu and Walker, 2011.

**1.4 Scope**

Based upon these observations, it is now thought that maternal-fetal signaling can modulate the pathogenesis of NEC, and that a window of opportunity may exist in utero to prevent this disease. To test this hypothesis, the presently disclosed subject matter focuses on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that recognizes environmental and dietary ligands, Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019, including those present in green leafy vegetables, Kiss et al., 2011; Amakura et al., 2008, and which has been shown to induce immune protection. Shinde and McGaha, 2018.

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates that administration of a maternal diet that is rich in AHR ligand during pregnancy can prevent NEC in the offspring, and that AHR signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium prevents NEC by curtailing the extent of TLR4 signaling. The presently disclosed subject matter also shows that breast milk—a maternal-derived tissue with strong anti-NEC effects—prevents NEC through activation of AHR in the newborn gut and reduction of TLR4 signaling. Finally, using a screen of clinically relevant compounds, an AHR ligand has been identified that can activate AHR and limit TLR4 in human tissue, thus serving as a novel NEC prevention agent when administered in utero. Taken together, these findings establish a critical link between maternal-fetal AHR signaling and NEC prevention, and highlight a role for AHR in the pathogenesis and treatment of this devastating disease.

**1.5 Results**

**1.5.1 the Maternal Administration of the AHR Ligand Indole-3-Carbinole (I3C) During Pregnancy Prevents NEC in Newborn Mice**

Whether activation of AHR during pregnancy could prevent NEC in newborn mice was initially investigated. The experimental design for this investigation is shown in FIG. 1a. Supplementation of the maternal diet with the AHR ligand indole-3-carbinol (I3C) throughout pregnancy induced the expression of the AHR response gene Cyp1a1 in the small intestine of both the mother (FIG. 1B) and the fetus at e17.5 (FIG. 1c), confirming that AHR activation had occurred in both the mother and fetus. The continuation of administration of I3C to the lactating mother induced Cyp1a1 expression in suckling pups at p11 (FIG. 1d).

To determine whether maternal AHR administration could prevent NEC, either I3C or a control diet was administered to mice during pregnancy and lactation, and then induced NEC in the pups using a well-validated model, Good et al., 2015; Sodhi et al., 2018, that induces patchy intestinal necrosis, which closely mimics the human disease (see Methods Section 1.7 herein below). As shown in FIG. 1e-FIG. 1i, the oral administration of I3C during pregnancy significantly reduced the severity of experimental NEC in the pups, as manifest by reduced histological injury (FIG. 1e-FIG. 10, reduced expression of 116 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 1g), and reduced intestinal epithelial apoptosis (FIG. 1h-FIG. 1i).

Next, to determine whether maternal-derived AHR ligands were present in tissues to which the developing fetus would be exposed, amniotic fluid, breast milk, and serum were harvested from pregnant mice that had been administered either I3C or a control diet, which was then incubated with IEC-6 enterocytes to assess for AHR activation. As shown in FIG. 1j-FIG. 1l, exposure of each of these maternal-derived biological fluids significantly increased the expression of Cyp1a1 in cultured IEC-6 enterocytes, indicating that each maternal derived fluid contains AHR ligands.

Next, whether the maternal administration of I3C could blunt TLR4 signaling in the pup intestine was investigated, given the critical importance of TLR4 signaling to NEC pathogenesis. Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Hackam et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2014. As shown in FIG. 1m, maternal administration of I3C significantly reduced the induction of the proinflammatory cytokine 116 in the neonatal (p11) mouse intestine in response to the specific TLR4 ligand LPS, as compared to pups from non I3C-treated mothers, supporting a protective effect of maternal AHR activation. Taken together, these findings reveal that maternal delivery of AHR ligands to the fetus can prevent the development of NEC, prompting us to examine AHR signaling in the newborn mice.

1.5.2. The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor is Expressed on the Newborn Intestinal Epithelium where its Activation Protects Against the Development of Necrotizing Enterocolitis

To examine how the administration of AHR ligands during pregnancy can prevent NEC, AHR expression in the intestine in humans, mice and piglets with and without NEC was explored. As shown in FIG. 2, the expression of AHR was significantly reduced in the intestine of infants with NEC as compared with control infants (FIG. 2a-FIG. 2c), and also was reduced in the intestinal mucosa of mice that were induced to develop NEC (FIG. 2d-FIG. 2f), and in an experimental model of NEC in premature piglets (FIG. 2g-FIG. 2i), suggesting a universal response that is not specific for one species. To test whether a lack of AHR signaling was a cause and not a consequence of NEC, NEC was induced in mice from which Ahr globally (Ahr−/−) had been deleted, or specifically from the intestinal epithelium (AhrΔIEC) or the myeloid compartment (AhrΔlys). Confirmation of cell-specific Ahr deletion in each strain is shown in FIG. 7.

As shown in FIG. 2, Ahr−/− mice developed significantly more severe NEC than wild-type mice, as determined by higher histologic grade (FIG. 2j-FIG. 2k) and higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokine gene Tnfa (FIG. 2l). Importantly, AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium as opposed to leukocytes was required for the protection from NEC in these studies, as AhrΔIEC mice had more severe higher grade of NEC compared to wild-type or AhrΔlys mice (FIG. 2j-FIG. 2l), both of which express AHR on the intestinal epithelium (as seen in FIG. 7).

Based on the above findings, whether feeding neonatal mice an AHR ligand could reduce NEC severity was explored. To do so, an AHR-ligand rich infant diet was developed by supplementing the infant formula with I3C, Kiss et al., 2011, which was then administered to pups in our mouse NEC model (FIG. 3a). As shown in FIG. 3b, I3C administration induced the expression Cyp1a1 in the neonatal intestinal epithelium of wildtype and AhrΔlys mice, but not Ahr−/−, and to a lesser degree in AhrΔIEC mice, confirming the appropriate activation of the AHR pathway in the neonatal gut. Importantly, I3C supplementation significantly reduced the severity of NEC in wild-type mice (FIG. 3a, FIG. 3c), but had relatively scant protective effect in either AhrΔIEC or no protective effect in Ahr−/− mice (FIG. 3a, FIG. 3c), confirming that AHR activation in the intestinal epithelium by I3C is required for protection against NEC. In an important control, I3C supplementation continued to exert a moderate protective effect when administered to AhrΔlys mice, which still express AHR on the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 3a, FIG. 3c). For these experiments, the corresponding breast fed controls maintain a normal histology, as shown in FIG. 8.

Taken together, these findings illustrate that AHR activation on the intestinal epithelium protects against NEC development, prompting us to examine the potential mechanisms involved.

**1.5.3 AHR Activation Protects Against NEC Independent of IL-22 and Intestinal Permeability**

To investigate potential mechanisms by which AHR activation in the neonatal intestinal epithelium can reduce NEC severity, other systems in which AHR activation has been shown to play a protective role were investigated. Specifically, AHR signaling critically regulates the mucosal Th17 and ILC3 lymphocyte populations, each of which are sources of IL-22, Schiering et al., 2017, thus accounting for the essential role of IL-22 in mediating the protective effect of AHR in other models. To investigate whether IL-22 was required for the protection by AHR against NEC as determined in FIG. 2, I3C was administered and then NEC was induced in Il22−/− mice. As shown in FIG. 9, I3C supplementation induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 9a) and reduced NEC severity (FIG. 9b and FIG. 9c), illustrating that IL-22 was not required for the protective effects of AHR activation on NEC. Consistent with this finding, in the early postnatal period in which NEC is induced, it was observed that Th17 (FIG. 9d) and ILCs (FIG. 9e-FIG. 9g) were found to be rare populations in the intestinal mucosa, a finding supported by others. Egan et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2015.

In further consideration of the protective mechanisms by which AHR activation can reduce NEC, the possibility that AHR activation could regulate tight junction expression and intestinal barrier integrity was considered, as has been shown by others in older mice. Singh et al., 2019. No difference was found, however, in the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in the newborn ileum (FIG. 9h) or intestinal permeability after oral gavage of labelled dextran (FIG. 9i), making it unlikely that the effects of AHR activation can be attributed to barrier integrity. Based upon these studies, and given that TLR4 plays a critical role in NEC pathogenesis, Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Hackam et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2014, the possibility that AHR activation could reduce TLR4 signaling or expression in the neonatal intestinal epithelium was investigated.

**1.5.4 AHR Activation Limits TLR4 Signaling and Expression in the Intestinal Epithelium of Mice and Humans**

To directly investigate whether AHR activation could limit TLR4 signaling in the intestinal epithelium, studies were first performed in primary enteroids derived from both wild-type and Ahr−/− mice (FIG. 4a). Treatment of enteroids with I3C induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in wild-type, but not Ahr−/− enteroids (FIG. 4b), confirming that AHR is appropriately activated on intestinal epithelial cells.

Importantly, I3C significantly reduced the LPS-mediated induction of Tnfa in wild-type, but not Ahr−/− enteroids (FIG. 4c), consistent with a reduction in TLR4 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. In seeking to understand whether I3C could inhibit intestinal Tlr4 in vivo, wild-type p11 mice were fed a diet rich in I3C, which induced Cyp1a1 expression in their intestinal epithelium (FIG. 4d) and significantly reduced TLR4 signaling, as manifest by reduced LPS-induced Tnfa expression (FIG. 4e), which was accompanied by reduced expression of Tlr4 in the intestinal mucosa (FIG. 4f). I3C administration did not induce Cyp1a1 (FIG. 4d) and did not reduce either TLR4 signaling (FIG. 4e) or Tlr4 expression (FIG. 40 in Ahr−/− mice, confirming the specificity of the I3C effect. In gaining insights into how AHR activation could reduce Tlr4 expression, it is noted that I3C significantly upregulated the expression in the ileum of microRNAs that are known to negatively regulate Tlr4 expression, namely miR-146b, miR-223 and let-7i in wild type mice, He et al., 2014, while I3C did not increase the expression of these microRNAs in Ahr−/− mice (FIG. 4g-FIG. 4i).

To assess whether AHR activation could reduce TLR4 signaling in human intestine, we next treated intestinal explant cultures derived from freshly resected intestinal samples from premature infants undergoing surgery for NEC, with both LPS and I3C. As shown in FIG. 4j-FIG. 4k, I3C treatment of human intestinal cultures induced the expression of Cyp1a1, revealing activation of AHR in human tissue, and also reduced TLR4 signaling, as revealed by reduced LPS-induced Tnf-a expression (FIG. 4k). Taken together, these findings indicate that AHR activation inhibits TLR4 signaling and expression in the intestinal epithelium. Given the findings that maternal-fetal signaling can regulate NEC, as well as the observation in FIG. 1 that breast milk can induce the AHR downstream gene Cyp1a1, whether AHR signaling could explain in part the protective effects of breast milk for NEC was then explored.

**1.5.5 Breast Milk Reduces TLR4 Signaling and Prevents NEC Via AHR Activation in the Newborn Intestinal Epithelium**

As observed in FIG. 1 that maternal ligands can be delivered in utero to protect NEC in the offspring. These findings were extended to examine whether breast milk—which is by definition rich in maternal-derived ligands—could activate AHR in the intestinal mucosa of the pup, and thus reduce TLR4 signaling and prevent NEC. To test this possibility directly, enteroids were harvested from the ilea of wild-type and Ahr−/− mice, and then treated with LPS in the presence or absence of human breast milk. As shown in FIG. 5a, treatment of wild-type enteroids with breast milk activated AHR, as revealed by induction of Cyp1a1, a finding not seen in either saline-treated or Ahr−/− enteroids, and revealing that breast milk is enriched in maternally-derived AHR ligands.

Importantly, breast milk reduced TLR4 signaling in enteroids in an AHR-dependent manner (FIG. 5b), as indicated by the significant reduction in LPS-induced Tnfa expression in wild-type but not Ahr−/− enteroids after breast milk treatment. TLR4-induced apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium is an important feature of mouse and human NEC, Leaphart et al., 2007; Neal et al., 2012, leading to next assess whether breast milk could prevent TLR4-induced apoptosis in enteroids via AHR. As shown in FIG. 5c-FIG. 5d, LPS significantly increased enterocyte apoptosis in wildtype enteroids, and the degree of induction was reduced after treatment with breast milk, a protective effect that was absent in Ahr−/− enteroids (FIG. 5c-FIG. 5d). Breast milk also required AHR to inhibit TLR4 signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium, as the oral administration of breast milk to mice that had been maintained without oral feeds for 3 hours induced the expression Cyp1a1 and significantly reduced LPS-induced 116 expression in the intestinal mucosa of wild-type but not Ahr−/− mice (FIG. 5e).

To assess whether the protective effects of breast milk for NEC required AHR, infant formula was supplemented with human breast milk and a reduction in NEC severity in wild-type mice was observed (FIG. 5g), but almost no protection by breast milk on NEC in Ahr−/− mice (FIG. 5h), as revealed by no reduction in histology and severity score (FIG. 5g-FIG. 5h), or the expression of iNos (FIG. 5i), or Tlr4 (FIG. 5j). Taken together, these findings reveal that maternally-derived factors secreted into the breast milk can reduce TLR4 signaling and attenuate NEC in the offspring. Whether these observations could be exploited therapeutically was investigated next, including a search for novel AHR agonists that could prevent NEC after maternal administration.

1.5.6 Discovery of the AHR Ligand, “A18,” which Activates AHR and Reduces TLR4 Signaling in Human Tissue and Prevents NEC in Mice when Administered During Pregnancy

To search for AHR ligands that could be used to prevent or treat NEC when administered during pregnancy, a clinical compound library containing FDA-approved drugs, Chong et al., 2006, was screened against an AHR-luciferase screen in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 cells) (FIG. 6a). The lead compound, shown in FIG. 6b, is a 369KDa molecule with the formula C16H14F3N3O2S, herein called “A18,” which induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in IEC-6 enterocytes (FIG. 6c) and in the intestinal epithelium when fed to wild-type, but not Ahr−/− newborn mice (FIG. 6d) confirming its role as a specific AHR ligand.

Importantly, feeding A18 to mice significantly reduced TLR4-induced 116 expression (FIG. 6e), and reduced Tlr4 expression in the newborn ileum (FIG. 60, providing further confirmation of the ability of AHR to limit TLR4 in the neonatal gut. Further, A18 administration significantly reduced NEC severity when administered orally to wild-type but not Ahr−/− mice, as manifest by improved histology (FIG. 6g), improved NEC severity score (FIG. 6h), and reduced expression of I16 (FIG. 6j). The potential clinical relevance of A18 was found as the ex vivo treatment of human intestine obtained from infants undergoing surgery with A18 significantly induced Cyp1a1 expression (FIG. 6j), confirming its ability to activate AHR in human tissue, and significantly reduced LPS-induced Tnf-a expression (FIG. 6k) and Tlr4 expression (FIG. 6l), consistent with the findings in mice (FIG. 6e).

Finally, to assess the ability of A18 to modulate the maternal-fetal signaling pathway and reduce NEC, we administered A18 to mice during pregnancy. As shown in FIG. 6m, the administration of A18 during pregnancy induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the offspring pup intestine, and also significantly reduced NEC severity as manifest by reduced Tnf-a (FIG. 6n) and Tlr4 expression (FIG. 6o) in the neonatal gut, and improved histology and NEC severity (FIG. 6p-q). Taken together, these results suggest a surprising role for maternal-fetal AHR signaling in NEC, and raise the possibility that A18 can serve as a novel agent that can be administered either during pregnancy or postnatally for the prevention and treatment of this devastating disease.

**1.6 Discussion**

The persistently high mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis, Han et al., 2020, reveals both a lack of a sufficient understanding of its pathogenesis, and an urgency to approach the disease differently. This study sheds light on the possibility that NEC arises from reduced AHR signaling in the intestinal epithelium of the premature infant and shows that AHR ligands may be passed from mother to infant—both during pregnancy via the fetal circulation, and in the postnatal period through the breast milk—where they can attenuate the severity of this disease. The mechanism by which AHR activation in the intestinal epithelium attenuates NEC severity involves a reduction in signaling and expression of the innate immune receptor TLR4, whose expression is elevated in the premature bowel as compared with the full term bowel, Gribar et al., 2014; Sodhi et al., 2012, and whose activation on the intestinal epithelium has been shown to be critical for NEC development. Leaphart et al., 2007; Sodhi et al., 2012; Egan et al., 2016. The therapeutic potential of the current findings was revealed by the identification of the AHR ligand A18 to prevent NEC when fed to mice during pregnancy, and by showing its ability to reduce TLR4 signaling in human bowel ex vivo. In view of the fact that NEC almost always develops in the absence of breast milk and the presence of formula feeds, Nino et el, 2016, these findings suggest the possibility that the development of NEC may reflect impaired AHR signaling in the neonatal intestine, and also show that strategies to enhance the delivery of AHR ligands either directly to the neonate, or secondarily through the mother, may offer new strategies for the prevention or treatment of NEC.

Previous authors have shown AHR to be a gatekeeper for the availability of AHR ligands in the intestinal immune system, Schiering et al. 2017, from either microbial or dietary origin, Brawner et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2018, and a critical link between AHR, dietary factors and intestinal immunity has been proposed. Shinde and McGaha, 2018. The current studies now reveal that AHR signaling on leukocytes is dispensable for the protective role of AHR against NEC, in favor of AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium. This observation is distinct from a large body of work that reveals that the activation of AHR on leukocytes is required for the maintenance of Th17 and ILC3 cells in the intestinal mucosa, Kiss et al., 2011; Veldhoen et al., 2008, leading to AHR-mediated protection from colitis through IL-22 release. Monteleone et al., 2011.

Differences between those studies and our own may lie in the fact that Th17 and ILC3 cells are rare in the neonatal intestinal mucosa at the time points in which NEC develops. Chen et al., 2015; Egan et al., 2016. It is noteworthy that intestinal AHR signaling also has been linked to the release of antimicrobial peptides, Kiss et al., 2011, and to increased differentiation of secretory cells, Alvarado et al, 2019, processes, which are both downstream of TLR4 activation in the gut, Sodhi et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014, and thus consistent with the current work. Without wishing to be bound to any one particular theory, it is thought that that differences between the current work and prior studies also reveal unique features of NEC, including differences in the location of disease along the gastrointestinal tract (NEC is an ileal disease while colitis affects the colon), age (NEC occurs in the newborn period whereas these other models occur in older mice), as well as differences in microbial ligands which may be present in models of colitis versus NEC, and which could activate AHR.

One of the most translationally relevant findings of the current study is the identification of an AHR ligand that can prevent NEC, either when offered orally during pregnancy (FIG. 6m-q), or when administered directly to the neonatal pups (FIG. 6g-i). As revealed from its chemical structure in FIG. 6b, the AHR ligand A18 belongs to the benzimidazole class of proton pump inhibitors, which also includes omeprazole. Yang et al., 2016. These FDA-approved drugs are currently in clinical use for hyperacidity diseases, and could be conceivably repurposed for NEC, just as they have been repositioned as anticancer therapeutics. Jin et al., 2014. The identification of the heterocylic A18 as a potent AHR substrate reflects the broad range of hydrophobic structural motifs that bind to the AHR. Gutierrez-Vazquez and Quintana, 2018.

In seeking to understand the chemical mechanism of AHR binding so as to develop novel analogues for clinical use, it is noted that the indole nucleus is a privileged ligand for AHR, Denison and Faber, 2017, suggesting that the benzimidazole core of A18 is the main pharmacophore for AHR activation. Major limits of A18 for clinical use in preventing NEC include the fact that while A18 is rapidly absorbed and approximately 97% bound in human plasma, it is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C18, and plasma elimination half-life is only approximately 2 h in humans, Landes et al., 1995, leaving much room for further improvement. Moreover, acid reduction therapy has been linked to an increase in NEC when administered to premature neonates, Alganabi et al., 2019, indicating that A18 will need to be modified in order to enhance its AHR signaling but reduce its effects on gastric acidity.

The current findings may have direct impact on clinical medicine. First, these finding have shown that NEC may not only be a disease of the postnatal period, but may also reflect impaired maternal-fetal signaling through AHR. Second, these finding also have provided important insights into how breast milk may protect against NEC, by revealing its ability to activate AHR on the neonatal intestinal epithelium, where it can attenuate TLR4 signaling. But perhaps of most significance is the opportunity to interfere with the molecular pathways that lead to the development of NEC through the intra-partum oral delivery of AHR ligands including I3C or A18. If confirmed in clinical studies, these findings may offer the unique ability to intervene in the setting of premature labor, by administering an AHR ligand that could serve to protect the gut and reduce the risk of NEC development in the neonate. In support of the possible success of a strategy in which antenatal delivery of AHR ligands may protect the neonate, it is noteworthy that pregnant women who adhered to a Mediterranean diet—which is rich in AHR ligands—were found to have significantly less necrotizing enterocolitis than mothers who did not adhere to a Mediterranean diet. Parlapani et al., 2019. Taken in aggregate, the current finds offer the prospect of a renewed approach to NEC, and perhaps finally to a chance to alter the trajectory of this devastating disease.

**1.7 Methods**

**1.7.1 Mice**

All mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. To generate tissue specific knockouts of Ahr from either epithelial cells (AhrΔIEC) or leukocytes (AhrΔlys), mice harboring a floxed allele of Ahrfx (Ahrtm3.1Bra/J) were bred with transgenic mice expressing Villin-Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Vill-cre)997Gum/J) and LysM-Cre (B6.129P2-Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo/J) respectively. To generate global knockouts of Ahr (Ahr−/−), Ahr mice were bred with transgenic mice expressing global Cre under the transcriptional control of a human cytomegalovirus minimal promoter CMV-Cre (B6.C-Tg(CMVcre) 1Cgn/J). The homozygous I122c″ mice (C57BL/6-Il22tm1.1(icre)Stck/J), in which the presence of iCre abolishes expression of 1122, served as Il22−/− mice. Ahlfors et al., 2014. For flow cytometry experiments, Foxp3GFP mice or RorgtGFP mice were bred with Ahr to generate Foxp3GFP; Ahr−/− and RorgtGFP; Ahr reporter mice, respectively. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen free environment on a 12-hour-light/12-hour-dark cycle with free access to water and standard rodent chow (Teklad global 18% protein rodent diets, Envigo) except otherwise specified. All mouse and piglet experiments were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.

**1.7.2 Discovery of AHR Ligands for the Prevention or Treatment of NEC in Mice**

The intestinal epithelial cells line IEC-6 (ATCC CRL-1592) was stably transduced with lentiviral particles containing Cignal Lenti XRE Reporter (luc) (Qiagen). Cells were treated serially with individual chemicals contained within the Johns Hopkins Drug Library (JHDL), which contains a series of FDA-approved drugs, Chong et al., 2006, (kindly provided by Dr. Jun O. Liu, Johns Hopkins University) at 10 μM for 24 hours, and the luciferase activity was quantified using the SpectraMax M3 (Molecular Devices).

Hits were validated for activation of AHR signaling by oral gavage into neonatal C57/B16 mice (p11), and measuring the expression of the AHR activation reporter Cyp1a1 by qRT-PCR in the intestinal mucosa 24 hours later. The lead compound from these studies is herein labelled “A18”.

**1.7.3 Induction of NEC in Mice.**

Experimental NEC was induced in 7-day old mice as we have previously described, Good et al., 2015; Sodhi et al., 2018; Egan et al., 2016, by gavage feeding newborn mice with formula containing Similac Advance infant formula (Abbott Nutrition): Esbilac (PetAg) canine milk replacer, 2:1 ratio, which was supplemented with enteric bacteria made from a stock created from a specimen obtained from an infant with surgical NEC five times per day.

Additionally, the mice were subjected to hypoxia (5% 02-95% N2) for 10 min in a hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) twice daily for 4 days. The AHR ligands I3C and A18 were administered by oral gavage during the induction of NEC at the dose of 25 mg/kg body weight/day and 300 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively. To test the protective effect of breast milk on AHR signaling a NEC, human breast milk (Innovative Research) was supplemented to the formula at the final concentration of 5%.

Age-matched breast milk-fed mouse pups were used as healthy controls. Evaluation of ileal histology and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by qRT-PCR at a fixed point in the terminal ileum 2-cm proximal to the cecum, were used to determine the disease severity.

**1.7.4 Induction of NEC in Piglets**

To induce NEC in piglets, timed-pregnant White Yorkshire (Yorkshire x Landrace) sows were obtained from Oak Hill Genetics, and piglets were delivered prematurely via cesarean section at approximately 95% gestation as we have described, Good et al, 2014, in a modification of the work of Sun et al., 2018. NEC was induced in piglets by gavage formula at 15 mL/kg every 3 h (120 ml/kg per day) for 4 days (n=7) of the following (per liter): Pepdite Junior (93.9 g; Nutricia), MCT Oil (38.3 g, USP grade; Now Foods), whey protein isolate (56 g, Now Foods), and 837 g water, which was supplemented with enteric bacteria made from a specimen obtained from an infant with surgical NEC.

**1.7.5 Mice Endotoxemia Model**

Endotoxemia was induced in neonatal mouse pups (p11) by administering 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharides (LPS) via intraperitoneal injection, and ileal samples were harvested 6 hours after LPS treatments. I3C or A18 were given through oral gavage daily 3 days prior to the LPS injection at the dose of 25 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively.

**1.7.6 AHR Induction in Pregnant Mice**

For activation of AHR during pregnancy in mice, wild type mice were fed an AHR ligand-free diet, Brawner et al., 2019, (AIN-76A, Bio Serv), and the AHR ligands I3C and A18 were administered by oral gavage at the dose of 25 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively. I3C and A18 were administered to the pregnant mother daily until the offspring were studied further for experimental NEC or endotoxemia as above.

1.7.7 Harvest and Culture of Enteroids from Mouse Ileum

Primary intestinal crypt cultures (enteroids) were generated from the ileum of neonatal (p7-p11) wild type and Ahr′ mice at as described, Neal et al., 2012, and maintained in Matrigel (Corning). The enteroids were digested and passed using TrypLE Express (Gibco) weekly, and used between passage 3 and 10 for all experiments. The enteroids were pre-treated with I3C (200 mM, 12 h), A18 (20 μM, 12 h) or human breast milk (100 μL/mL, Innovative Research, prepared by 5-minute-cenrifugation at 12,000 g and then filtration of supernatant through a 0.22-μm filter) and then treated with LPS (50 μg/mL) for 4 hours for further analysis.

**1.7.8 Human Ileal Sample Collection and Explant Culture**

De-identified human ileal samples were collected via waiver of consent from the Office of Human Subjects Research Review Boards at Johns Hopkins University (IRB00094036), during surgery for NEC or at the time of stoma closure. For RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis, fresh samples were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen immediately. For human explant culture, fresh ileum samples from NEC patients or patient undergoing stoma re-anastomosis were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing gentamycin (5 μg/mL), minced into 2- to 4-mm diameter pieces, and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 μg/mL human recombinant insulin and 100 μg/mL Primocin. Human ilea explant cultures were then pre-treated with 200 μM I3C or 20 μM A18 for 15 minutes, and then with 50 μg/mL LPS for 6 hours, then processed for total RNA isolation followed by qRT-PCR.

**1.7.9 Immunofluorescence Staining**

5-μm tissue sections from mouse, piglet and human intestine were rehydrated, heated in 10-mmol/L citric acid buffer for antigen retrieval, permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20, probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4° C., probed with secondary antibody and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Biolegend) for 1 hour at room temperature, and then mounted in Gelvatol mounting media (Sigma-Aldrich) for imaging. To assess apoptosis, samples were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) detection solution (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche) as per manufacturer's instructions. Slides were incubated with the nuclear marker DAPI, mounted using Gelvatol solution prior to imaging using a Nikon Eclipse Ti Confocal microscope. For immunofluorescence staining of enteroids, cells were cultured in 10 μL Matrigel on chamber slides.

After 20 minutes fixation in 4% PFA at room temperature, the enteroids were washed with PBS, probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4° C., probed with secondary antibody and DAPI for 1 hour at room temperature, and then mounted in Gelvatol mounting media for imaging. Antibodies are: goat-anti AHR (sc-8089, Santa Cruz), rabbit-anti KI67 (ab15580, Abcam), Anti-Ecadherin (AF748; R&D Systems), Rhodamine Phalloidin (R415; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

1.7.10 RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, Quantification of mRNA and miRNA.

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and complementary DNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The mRNA quantification was performed on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using iTaq™ universal SYBR® Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and the primers listed in Table 1. The relative mRNA expression levels were normalized against the expression of the housekeeping gene ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (Rplp0). For microRNA isolation, freshly harvested, snap-frozen ileal tissue was subjected to total RNA isolation using the RNeasy plus universal mini kit (Qiagen) and miRNA was quantified using miScript PCR starter kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The relative miRNA expression levels were normalized against the expression of housekeeping miRNA miR-191.

**1.7.11 Lamina Propria Cell Isolation and Flow Cytometry**

Lamina propria cells were isolated from the newborn mouse ileum according to the methods of Hepworth et al., 2013. In brief, the mesentery was removed from the freshly isolated ileum, and the bowel was then opened longitudinally and cut into 1-cm pieces, and incubated in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1-mM dithioerythritol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM EDTA at 37° C. for 20 minutes with agitation at 180 rpm. After filtration through a 70-μm cell strainer, the remaining tissue was finely minced with scissors, and incubated in RPMI containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mg/mL collagenase/dispase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.02 mg/mL DNase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37° C. for 40 minutes with agitation at 180 rpm. After filtration through sequential 70-μm and 40-μm cell strainers, the lamina propria leukocytes were collected between the interface of 40% and 60% discontinuous Percoll in preparation for flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions were washed using ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.01% NaN3) and incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Bioscience) to block Fc receptor binding (20 minutes, 4° C.) on mouse cells. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in optimal concentrations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies in ice-cold FACS buffer to stain surface molecules. The dead cells were stained using Fixable Viability Violet Dye (Thermo Fisher) in PBS.

**2.1 Overview**

The current technology seeks to prevent or treat inflammatory conditions that affect children, most notably necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease of premature infants that is characterized by the acute onset of inflammation and necrosis of the intestine, leading eventually to overwhelming sepsis and death. NEC develops in the setting of prematurity, formula feeds and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and over a third of affected patients die from the disease. In seeking to understand the pathogenesis of NEC, we and others have shown that exaggerated signaling of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium plays a critical role in NEC development. TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation. The Hackam group has discovered that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in mice and human tissue can inhibit TLR4 signaling, and thus serve to dampen inflammation in the gut.

The finding that AHR activation could inhibit TLR4 signaling therefore led us to search for novel AHR agonists that could be used as therapeutics for NEC. To this end, Hackam and coworkers identified the AHR analogue “A18”, which had been identified and sold commercially as the proton pump inhibitor “Lansoprazole”. The administration of lansoprazole effectively prevented and treated NEC in mouse models, and dampened inflammation in the intestine of human resected at the time of surgery for NEC. Analogues of A18 were then synthesized and developed. A total of 235 analogues were tested in mouse enteroid cell lines, and a “hit”, referred to herein as compound 169, was identified that activated AHR, and significantly inhibited TLR4 signaling in the gut.

The presently disclosed subject matter identifies compound #169 as an AHR agonist with the ability to inhibit TLR4 in the gut, and, pending in vivo analysis, to thus serve as a novel agent for the prevention and treatment of NEC. A computational similarity search based on A18 was conducted in an in-house library. Hundreds of structures were initially identified, binned, and selected for further investigation. Subsequent screens identified analogs, such as compound 169, as well as other structures referred to as #243 and #247. Subsequently, an SAR studies was conducted and representative compounds disclosed herein were prepared.

Importantly, it has been shown that A18 can be administered to pregnant mothers (mice) to treat NEC in the premature pups. This observation suggests that #169, and other identified analogs, could potentially be administered as a gut protective agent for the fetus when administered to the mother in the event of premature labor.

**2.2 General Considerations**

Unless stated to the contrary, where applicable, the following considerations apply: All reactions were performed under an N2 atmosphere that had been passed through a column (10×2 cm) of Drierite. All glassware and stir bars were dried in an oven for at least 3 h prior to use. Reactions run in microwave vials were sealed with Teflon 20-mm septa and crimped to ensure atmosphere exclusion. When necessary, degassed solvents were prepared by sparging with N2 for 1 h. Reactions were monitored by TLC analysis (pre-coated silica gel 60 F254) and spots were visualized (UV lamp 254 nm and 365 nm). Purifications by chromatography were performed with SiO2 (230-400 mesh) on a Teledyne ISCO system with reusable cartridges and monitored at 254 and 280 nm. Reverse phase chromatography was performed on a Biotage Isolera system with C18-SiO2 cartridges and monitored 200-400 nm. 1H/13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance, 300/75 MHz, Bruker Avance 400/100 MHz or Bruker Avance 500/125 MHz instruments.

High resolution mass spectra were obtained on a Micromass UK Limited, Q-TOF Ultima API or a Thermo Scientific Exactive Orbitrap LC-MS. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) with the residual solvent peak (CDCl3: 7.26 ppm for 1H, 77.16 ppm for 13C; DMSO-d6: 2.50 ppm for 1H, 39.52 ppm for 13C) used as the internal standard. Chemical shifts were tabulated as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, dd=doublet of doublet, dt=doublet of triplet, ddd=doublet of doublet of doublet, m=multiplet, brs=broad singlet), coupling constant(s), and integration. Known intermediates were assigned based on comparison with authentic 1H NMR spectra. IR spectra were obtained using neat samples on a Perkin-Elmer 100 IR-ATR spectrometer. Melting points were obtained using a Mel-Temp instrument and are uncorrected.

### Example 3

**3.1 Overview**

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates, in part, that activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in mice and human tissue can inhibit TLR4 signaling, and thus serve to dampen inflammation in the gut. The finding that AHR activation could inhibit TLR4 signaling led to a search for novel AHR agonists that could be used as therapeutics for NEC. To this end, the AHR analogue “A18”, which had been identified and sold commercially as the proton pump inhibitor “Lansoprazole,” was identified as an AHR agonist. The administration of lansoprazole, i.e., A18, effectively prevented and treated NEC in mouse models, and dampened inflammation in the intestine of human resected at the time of surgery for NEC.

**3.2 Results and Discussion**

Analogues of A18 were then synthesized and developed. A total of 235 analogues were tested in mouse enteroid cell lines. Compound #169, and other structures, referred to herein as compound #243 and compound #247, activated AHR signaling (FIG. 15a) and significantly inhibited TLR4 signaling (FIG. 15b) as indicated by attenuated Tnf-a induction by TLR4 ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse enteroids.

To determine whether compound #169, compound #243, or compound #247 could potentially be administered as a gut protective agent against NEC, compound #169, compound #243, or compound #247 was supplemented into infant formula, which was then administered to pups in a mouse NEC model. As shown in FIG. 16a, administration of 20 mg/kg/day of compound #247 significantly induced the expression of Cyp1a1, a hallmark of AHR activation, while administration of 20 mg/kg/day of compound #169 or compound #243 did not induce the expression of Cyp1a1 in vivo. Administration of compound #169, compound #243, or compound #247, however, did not reduce the severity of NEC, as manifested by similar expression of IL-1b, IL-6, Tnf-a and Lcn2 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 16b-FIG. 16e) and reduced histological injury (FIG. 16f-FIG. 16j).

Analogues of compound #169 were then synthesized and developed (FIG. 17). A total of 22 analogues were tested in mouse enteroid cell lines for activation of AHR signaling (FIG. 18) and inhibition of TLR4 signaling (FIG. 19). One representative compound, referred to herein as compound #263, significantly inhibited the TLR4 signaling in mouse enteroids to a similar extent than compound #169 (FIG. 19).

To further determine whether compound #263 could potentially be administered as a gut protective agent against NEC, compound #263 was supplemented into the infant formula, which was then administered to pups in the mouse NEC model. As shown in FIG. 20a, administration of 20 mg/kg/day of compound #263 significantly induced the expression of Cyp1a1. Administration of 20 mg/kg/day of compound #263 also significantly reduced the severity of experimental NEC in the pups, as manifest by reduced expression of IL-1b, IL-6, Tnf-a and Lcn2 in the intestinal epithelium (FIG. 20b-FIG. 20e) and reduced histological injury (FIG. 20f-FIG. 20g).

**3.3 Methods**

**3.3.1 Mice**

The C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen free environment on a 12-hour-light/12-hour-dark cycle with free access to water and standard rodent chow (Teklad global 18% protein rodent diets, Envigo) except otherwise specified. All mouse experiments were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.

**3.3.2 Induction of NEC in Mice**

Experimental NEC was induced in 7-day old mice as we have previously described, Good et al., 2015; Sodhi et al., 2018; Egan et al., 2016, by gavage feeding newborn mice with formula containing Similac Advance infant formula (Abbott Nutrition): Esbilac (PetAg) canine milk replacer, 2:1 ratio, which was supplemented with enteric bacteria made from a stock created from a specimen obtained from an infant with surgical NEC five times per day.

Additionally, the mice were subjected to hypoxia (5% 02-95% N2) for 10 min in a hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) twice daily for 4 days. The compound #169, compound #243, compound #247 or compound #263 administered by oral gavage during the induction of NEC at the dose of 20 mg/kg body weight/day.

Age-matched breast milk-fed mouse pups were used as healthy controls. Evaluation of ileal histology by H&E staining and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by qRT-PCR at a fixed point in the terminal ileum 2-cm proximal to the cecum, were used to determine the disease severity.

3.3.3 Harvest and Culture of Enteroids from Mouse Ileum

Primary intestinal crypt cultures (enteroids) were generated from the ileum of neonatal (p7-p11) mice at as described, Neal et al., 2012, and maintained in Matrigel (Corning). The enteroids were digested and passed using TrypLE Express (Gibco) weekly, and used between passage 3 and 10 for all experiments. The enteroids were pre-treated with tested compound (40 uM, overnight) and then treated with LPS (50 μg/mL) for 6 hours for further analysis.

3.3.4 RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, Quantification of mRNA and miRNA.

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and complementary DNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The mRNA quantification was performed on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using iTaq™ universal SYBR® Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and the primers listed in Table 2. The relative mRNA expression levels were normalized against the expression of the housekeeping gene ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P0 (Rplp0).
