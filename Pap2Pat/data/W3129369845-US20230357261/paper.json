    "title": "Maternal aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation protects newborns against necrotizing enterocolitis",
    "date": "2021-02-15",
    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of premature infants characterized by acute intestinal necrosis. Current dogma suggests that NEC develops in response to post-natal dietary and bacterial factors, and so a potential role for in utero factors in NEC remains unexplored. We now show that during pregnancy, administration of a diet rich in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligand indole-3-carbinole (I3C), or of breast milk, activates AHR and prevents NEC in newborn mice by reducing Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in the newborn gut. Protection from NEC requires activation of AHR in the intestinal epithelium which is reduced in mouse and human NEC, and is independent of leukocyte activation. Finally, we identify an AHR ligand (\u201cA18\u201d) that limits TLR4 signaling in mouse and human intestine, and prevents NEC in mice when administered during pregnancy. In summary, AHR signaling is critical in NEC development, and maternally-delivered, AHR-based therapies may alleviate NEC.",

                "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an often fatal disease of premature infants that is characterized by the acute onset of inflammation and necrosis of the intestine, leading to overwhelming sepsis and death1,2. NEC develops in the setting of premature birth, the administration of formula feeds, and bacterial colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal tract, and caries a 30% mortality rate3. In seeking to understand the pathogenesis of NEC, we4\u20136 and others7,8 have shown that exaggerated signaling of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium5 plays a critical role in NEC development. TLR4 is expressed at higher levels in the premature as compared with the full-term intestinal epithelium5,9, and its activation by luminal bacteria leads to mucosal death and bacterial translocation10,11. Current dogma suggests that NEC develops in response to dietary and bacteriologic factors that are present in the postnatal period, which explains why all preventive strategies have so far been targeted after birth12,13. However, there is emerging evidence to question this dogma, and to raise the possibility that NEC may also reflect an in utero process, and by extension, to suggest that interventions in the prenatal period could prevent NEC development. For example, NEC occurs more frequently and with greater severity in babies who are born after in utero bacterial infection14,15, while certain maternal diets have been shown to reduce the incidence of premature birth and NEC1,16,17.",
                "Based upon these observations, we now hypothesize that maternal\u2013fetal signaling can modulate the pathogenesis of NEC, and that a window of opportunity may exist in utero to prevent this disease. To test this hypothesis, we focus here on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that recognizes environmental and dietary ligands18, including those present in green leafy vegetables19,20, and which has been shown to induce immune protection21.",
                "In this work, we now reveal that the administration of a maternal diet that is rich in the AHR ligand indole-3-carbinol (I3C) during pregnancy can prevent NEC in the offspring, and that subsequent AHR signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium prevents NEC by curtailing the extent of TLR4 signaling. We also show that breast milk prevents NEC through activation of AHR in the newborn gut and thus reducing TLR4 signaling in the newborn intestinal epithelium. Finally, using a screen of clinically relevant compounds, we identify an AHR ligand (\u201cA18\u201d) that can activate AHR and limit TLR4 in human tissue, thus serving as a potential NEC prevention agent when administered in utero. Taken together, these findings establish a critical link between maternal\u2013fetal AHR signaling and NEC prevention, and highlight a role for AHR in the pathogenesis and treatment of this devastating disease."

                        "We first sought to investigate whether activation of AHR during pregnancy could prevent NEC in newborn mice, and therefore used the experimental design in Fig.\u00a01a. Supplementation of the maternal diet with the AHR ligand I3C throughout pregnancy induced the expression of the AHR response gene Cyp1a1 in the small intestines of both the mother (Fig.\u00a01b) and the fetus at e17.5 (Fig.\u00a01c), confirming that AHR activation occurs in both the mother and fetus after in utero treatment. Continuing the administration of I3C to the lactating mother after delivery was also found to induce the expression of Cyp1a1 in the intestines of suckling pups at p1 and p11 (Fig.\u00a01d, e). Next, to determine whether maternal AHR activation could prevent NEC, we administered either I3C or a control diet that lacked I3C to mice during both pregnancy and lactation, and then induced NEC in the pups using a well-validated model22,23 that closely mimics the human disease (see Methods). As shown in Fig.\u00a01f\u2013h, the oral administration of I3C during pregnancy significantly reduced the severity of experimental NEC in the pups, as manifest by reduced histological injury (Fig.\u00a01f), reduced blinded NEC severity score (Fig.\u00a01g), and reduced expression of Il6 (Fig.\u00a01h) and Tnf-\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a01i) in the intestinal epithelium.Fig. 1Administration of the AHR ligand I3C during pregnancy protects against NEC in the newborn offspring.a Schematic illustrating the experimental setup in which administration of the AHR ligand I3C to the pregnant mother can be evaluated for effects on the development of NEC in the pups. b\u2013d mRNA expression of AHR activation marker Cyp1a1 in the ileum of pregnant mice (b, n\u2009=\u20093, 3 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0003), the fetus (c, n\u2009=\u20099, 8 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0317), and newborn mice at p1 (d, n\u2009=\u20093, 3 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0053) or neomates at p11 (e, n\u2009=\u20095, 7 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0002), on control diet (Ctrl) or maternal I3C enriched diet (M-I3C, 25\u2009mg per kg body weight per day). f\u2013i representative H&E-stained micrographs (f); NEC severity (g, n\u2009=\u20097, 6 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0031); mRNA expression of Il6 (h, n\u2009=\u200913, 13 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0329) and Tnf-\u03b1 (i, n\u2009=\u200913, 13 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0274) in the terminal ileum of pups with NEC from mothers (i.e., dams) who were fed either a control diet (Ctrl) or a diet rich in I3C (M-I3C, 25\u2009mg per kg body weight per day). j\u2013l AHR activation measured as Cyp1a1 expression in the intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-6) treated with amniotic fluid (j, n\u2009=\u200911, 11 wells of cells, p\u2009=\u20090.0104), breast milk (k, n\u2009=\u20093, 3 wells of cells, p\u2009=\u20090.0002), and serum (l, n\u2009=\u200913, 12 wells of cells, p\u2009=\u20090.0007) that were harvested from the pregnant mice that were either on the control diet (Ctrl) or I3C enriched diet (M-I3C, 25\u2009mg per kg body weight per day); m, n qRT-PCR showing expression of Il6 (m, n\u2009=\u20097, 8 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0192) and Tnf-\u03b1 (n, n\u2009=\u20097, 8 mice, p\u2009=\u20090.0004) in the ileum induced by LPS (50\u2009\u03bcg per mL for 6\u2009h) injection in neonatal mice, born from mice fed on control diet (Ctrl) or maternal I3C enriched diet (M-I3C, 25\u2009mg per kg body weight per day) during pregnancy.

                        "In order to determine whether maternal-derived AHR ligands were present in tissues to which the developing fetus would be exposed, we harvested the amniotic fluid, breast milk, and serum from pregnant mice that had been administered either I3C-enriched or a control diet. These maternal-derived fluids were then incubated with IEC-6 enterocytes and assessed for AHR activation. As shown in Fig.\u00a01j\u2013l, maternal-derived fluids from mothers that were fed an I3C-enriched diet but not a control diet resulted in a significant increase in the expression of Cyp1a1 in IEC-6 cells, indicating that these fluids contain maternal-derived AHR ligands.",
                        "Given the critical importance of TLR4 signaling to NEC pathogenesis4,5,11,24, we next sought to determine whether the maternal administration of I3C could blunt TLR4 signaling in the pup intestine. As shown in Fig.\u00a01m, n, maternal administration of I3C significantly reduced the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 and Tnf-\u03b1 in the neonatal (p11) mouse intestine in response to the administration of the specific TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharides (LPS), as compared to pups from non I3C-fed mothers, supporting a protective effect of maternal AHR activation on the TLR4 responsiveness of the neonatal pup.",
                        "Taken together, these findings reveal that maternal delivery of AHR ligands to the fetus can prevent the development of NEC. We next examined the site of AHR signaling in the newborn mice, and the mechanisms mediating its protective effects on the development of NEC."

                        "To examine how the administration of AHR ligands during pregnancy can prevent NEC, we next explored the expression of AHR in the small intestines of humans, mice, and piglets with and without NEC. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, the expression of AHR was significantly reduced in the small intestine of infants with NEC as compared with control infants (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c), in the intestinal mucosa of mice that were induced to develop NEC (Fig.\u00a02d\u2013f), and in an experimental model of NEC in premature piglets (Fig.\u00a02g\u2013i), compared to control subjects. These findings suggest a universal response of AHR reduction in NEC that is not specific to one species. To test whether a lack of AHR signaling was a cause and not a consequence of NEC, we induced NEC in mice from which we had deleted Ahr globally (Ahr-/-), or specifically from the intestinal epithelium (Ahr\u0394IEC) or the myeloid compartment (Ahr\u0394lys). Confirmation of cell-specific Ahr deletion in each strain is shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, Ahr-/- mice developed significantly more severe NEC than wild-type mice, as determined by higher histologic grade (Fig.\u00a02j, k) and higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes Il6 and Tnf-\u03b1\u00a0in the intestine (Fig.\u00a02l, m). Importantly, AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium as opposed to leukocytes was required for the protection from NEC, as Ahr\u0394IEC mice had more severe NEC compared to wild-type mice (Fig.\u00a02j\u2013m), while NEC severity was not different between wild-type mice and Ahr\u0394lys mice which lack AHR on leukocytes, but which express AHR on the intestinal epithelium (as seen in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01).Fig. 2AHR expression on the the intestinal epithelium is required for protection against NEC.a, b, d, e, g, h Representative confocal images and quantification of fluorescent intensity of AHR immuno-stained ileal sections of human (a, b, n\u2009=\u20097, 10 ileal section, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), mouse (d, e, n\u2009=\u20095, 5 ileal section, p\u2009=\u20090.0025), piglet (g, h, n\u2009=\u20097, 6 ileal section, p\u2009=\u20090.0004) ileal specimens from control (Ctrl) and NEC patients or animals.

                        "Based on the above findings, and to investigate whether activating AHR on the newborn intestinal epithelium could prevent NEC, we next explored whether feeding neonatal mice an AHR ligand could reduce NEC severity. To do so, we developed an AHR-ligand rich infant diet by supplementing the infant formula with I3C19, which was then administered to pups in our mouse NEC model (Fig.\u00a03a). As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, I3C administration induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the neonatal intestinal epithelium of wild-type and Ahr\u0394lys but not Ahr-/- mice, and to a much lesser degree in Ahr\u0394IEC mice, confirming the appropriate activation of the AHR pathway in the neonatal gut. Importantly, I3C supplementation significantly reduced the severity of NEC in wild-type mice (Fig.\u00a03a, c\u2013e) but had a relatively little protective effect in either Ahr\u0394IEC or Ahr-/- mice (Fig.\u00a03a, c\u2013e), confirming that AHR activation in the intestinal epithelium by I3C is required for protection against NEC. In an important control, I3C supplementation continued to exert a protective effect when administered to Ahr\u0394lys mice, which still express AHR on the intestinal epithelium (Fig.\u00a03a, c\u2013e). For these experiments, the corresponding breast fed controls maintain a normal histology, as shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a02. Furthermore, in order to gain additional insights into the effectiveness of I3C administration to newborn pups for the prevention of NEC, we performed a dose-response study using doses between 5\u201350\u2009mg per kg body weight per day, and identified that doses in the range of 25\u201350\u2009mg per kg body weight per day significantly activated AHR and protected mice from NEC, justifiying the selection of I3C dose of 25\u2009mg per kg body weight per day (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Taken together, these findings illustrate that AHR activation on the intestinal epithelium protects against NEC development. We, therefore, next examined the potential mechanisms involved.Fig. 3Feeding mice the AHR ligand I3C protects against NEC by activating AHR on the intestinal epithelium.a H&E-stained representative images in ileal sections of newborn mice, supplemented with AHR ligand I3C (25\u2009mg per kg body weight per day for 4 days) and induced to develop experimental NEC.

                        "To investigate potential mechanisms by which AHR activation in the neonatal intestinal epithelium could reduce NEC severity, we next turned to other systems in which AHR activation has been shown to play a protective role. AHR signaling has been shown to critically regulate mucosal Th17 and innate lymphoid type-3 (ILC3) cells, each of which are sources of IL-2225, a cytokine that is critical for the protective effects of AHR in other models. To investigate whether IL-22 was required for the protection by AHR against NEC, we administered I3C and then induced NEC in Il22-/- mice. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a04, I3C supplementation induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the intestinal epithelium (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a) and reduced NEC severity (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b\u2013d) in Il22-/- mice, illustrating that IL-22 was not required for the protective effects of AHR activation on NEC. Consistent with this finding, in the early postnatal period in which NEC is induced, we observed that Th17 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e) and ILCs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04f\u2013h) were found to be rare populations in the intestinal mucosa, a finding supported by others26,27.",
                        "We next considered the possibility that AHR activation could regulate tight junction expression and intestinal barrier integrity, as has been shown to occur in older mice28. Interestingly, we found no difference between wild-type and Ahr-/- mice in the distribution of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in the newborn ileum (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04i). There was also no difference between wild-type and Ahr-/- mice on intestinal permeability after oral gavage of labeled dextran at baseline in mice without NEC, or between groups of mice with NEC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04j), making it unlikely that the protective effects of AHR activation could be attributed to improved barrier integrity. We do note that the presence of NEC does increase permeability over control mice in both groups, suggesting that the NEC model is sufficient to induce an increase in barrier permeability, but insufficient to cause the epithelial and mucosal changes that lead to NEC. Furthermore, when assessing the total proportion of CD45-positive cells and neutrophils in the lamina propria, we determined that NEC significantly increased the number of CD45 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04k), the number of neutrophils (Ly6G\u2009+\u2009cells, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04l), and the percentage of CD45 cells that are neutrophils (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04m) in both wild-type and Ahr-/- mice. However, although there was a very slight increase of the numbers of CD45 cells and neutrophils in Ahr-/- mice compared with wild-type mice at baseline without NEC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04k, l), the percentage of CD45 cells that were neutrophils did not differ between Ahr-/- mice and wild-type mice at baseline (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04m), and there were also no significant differences on the numbers of CD45 cells, the number of neutrophils, and the percentage of neutrophils in CD45 cells in Ahr-/- compared with wild-type mice with NEC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04k\u2013m). These data support the overall findings that the effects of AHR signaling in preventing NEC are not due to broadscale reduction in inflammatory cells.",
                        "Prior authors have shown that interepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) subsets may confer protection against NEC and are dependent on AHR ligands for their survival29,30. We, therefore, next evaluated the possible role of IELs in the mechanisms by which AHR activation can protect against NEC. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, approximately 90% of the IEL T cells in the newborn mouse intestine were \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, which led us to focus on this subtype. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b, there were no changes in the quantity of IELs between wild-type and Ahr-/- pups. Moreover, administration of I3C did not increase the quantity of IELs, and there were also no significant differences on the quantity of IELs between mice with and without NEC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). Next, to directly assess a potential role for IELs in the mechanisms by which I3C protects against NEC, we depleted IELs in mice using a diptheria toxin depletion strategy, and assessed whether I3C administration could still protect against NEC. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d, treatment with I3C still induced Cyp1a1 in the intestinal mucosa in IEL-depleted mice, confirming that AHR activation had occurred within the newborn gut. Significantly, the administration of I3C still protected IEL-depleted pups from NEC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05e\u2013h), making it unlikely that the effects of I3C can be attributed to IELs.",
                        "Based upon these studies, and given that TLR4 plays a critical role in NEC pathogenesis4,5,11,24, we next turned to the potential role of AHR activation in reducing TLR4 signaling or expression in the neonatal intestinal epithelium."

Treatment of enteroids with I3C induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in wild-type but not Ahr-/- enteroids (Fig.\u00a04b), confirming that AHR is appropriately activated on intestinal epithelial cells. Importantly, I3C significantly reduced the LPS-mediated induction of Tnf-\u03b1 in wild-type but not Ahr-/- enteroids (Fig.\u00a04c), consistent with a reduction in TLR4 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.

Importantly, feeding I3C to wild-type p11 mice resulted in significant attenuation of TLR4 signaling, as manifest by reduced LPS-induced Il6 (Fig.\u00a04g) and Tnf-\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a04h) expression in the intestinal epithelium, and which was accompanied by reduced expression of Tlr4 in the intestinal mucosa (Fig.\u00a04i). I3C administration did not induce Cyp1a1 (Fig.\u00a04f) and did not reduce either TLR4 signaling (Fig.\u00a04g, h) or Tlr4 expression (Fig.\u00a04i) in Ahr-/- mice, confirming the specificity of the I3C effect. In seeking to understand how AHR activation could reduce Tlr4 expression, we note that I3C administration significantly upregulated the expression in the ileum of microRNAs that are known to negatively regulate Tlr4 expression, namely miR-146b, miR-223, and let-7i in wild type mice31, while I3C did not increase the expression of these microRNAs in Ahr-/- mice (Fig.\u00a04j\u2013l).",

In order to search for AHR ligands that could be used to prevent or treat NEC when administered during pregnancy, we next screened a clinical compound library containing FDA-approved drugs33 using an AHR-luciferase reporter intestinal epithelial cell line as described in Methods. Our lead compound, shown in Fig.\u00a06a, is a 369\u2009KDa molecule with the formula C16H14F3N3O2S, herein called \u201cA18\u201d. The administration of A18 induced luciferase expression in a dose dependent manner in the AHR-luciferase reporter cells (Fig.\u00a06b). A18 also induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in wild-type IEC-6 enterocytes (Fig.\u00a06c) and in the intestinal epithelium when fed to wild-type but not Ahr-/- newborn mice (Fig.\u00a06d), confirming that A18 signals through AHR. Importantly, feeding A18 to mice significantly reduced LPS-induced Il6 (Fig.\u00a06e) and Tnf-\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a06f) expression, and reduced Tlr4 expression in the newborn ileum (Fig.\u00a06g), providing further confirmation of the ability of AHR activation to limit TLR4 signaling in the neonatal gut.

As shown in Fig.\u00a06o, the administration of A18 during pregnancy induced the expression of Cyp1a1 in the offspring pup intestine, and also significantly reduced NEC severity as manifest by reduced Il6 (Fig.\u00a06p) and Tnf-\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a06q) and Tlr4 expression (Fig.\u00a06r) in the neonatal gut, and improved histology (Fig.\u00a06s) and NEC severity (Fig.\u00a06t). Taken together, these results suggest a surprising role for maternal\u2013fetal AHR signaling in NEC, and raise the possibility that A18 can serve as an agent that can be administered either during pregnancy or postnatally for the prevention and treatment of this devastating disease."

                "The persistently high mortality of NEC reveals both our lack of a sufficient understanding of its pathogenesis, and an urgency to approach the disease differently34. In this study, we shed light on the possibility that NEC arises from reduced AHR signaling in the intestinal epithelium of the premature infant, and show that AHR ligands may be passed from mother to infant\u2014both during pregnancy via the fetal circulation, and in the postnatal period through the breast milk\u2014where they can then attenuate the severity of this disease. The mechanism by which AHR activation in the intestinal epithelium attenuates NEC severity involves a reduction in signaling and expression of the innate immune receptor TLR4, whose expression is elevated in the premature bowel as compared with the full term bowel5,9, and whose activation on the intestinal epithelium we have shown to be critical for NEC development4,5,27. The therapeutic potential of the current findings was revealed by our identification of the AHR ligand A18 to prevent NEC when fed to mice during pregnancy, and by showing its ability to reduce TLR4 signaling in human bowel ex vivo. In view of the fact that the absence of breast milk is a major risk factor for NEC35\u201338, these findings suggest the possibility that the development of NEC may reflect impaired AHR signaling in the neonatal intestine, and also show that strategies to enhance the delivery of AHR ligands either directly to the neonate, or secondarily through the mother, may offer new strategies for the prevention or treatment of NEC.",
                "The current studies reveal that AHR signaling on leukocytes plays a minor role in the protection against NEC, in favor of AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium. This observation is distinct from a separate body of work that reveals that the activation of AHR on leukocytes is required for the maintenance of Th17 and ILC3 cells in the intestinal mucosa19,39, leading to AHR-mediated protection from colitis through IL-22 release40. Differences between those studies and our own may lie in the fact that Th17, IEL, and ILC3 cells are rare in the neonatal intestinal mucosa at the time points in which NEC develops26,27. It is noteworthy that intestinal AHR signaling has also been linked to the release of antimicrobial peptides19 and to the increased differentiation of secretory cells41, processes which are both downstream of TLR4 activation in the gut5,42, and thus consistent with the current work. The current work also calls attention to the unique features of NEC, including differences in the location of disease along the gastrointestinal tract (NEC is an ileal disease while colitis affects the colon), age (NEC occurs in the newborn period whereas these other models occur in older mice), as well as differences in microbial ligands which may be present in models of colitis versus NEC, and which could activate AHR. The current studies do not completely exclude a role for AHR signaling on myeloids cells in the pathogenesis of NEC, but rather they argue that NEC protection in response to AHR ligands requires AHR signaling on the intestinal epithelium. Taken together, these findings help provide a link between AHR, dietary factors and the unique immune characteristics of the neonatal gut21.",
                "One of the most translationally relevant findings of the current study is the identification of an AHR ligand that can prevent NEC, either when offered orally during pregnancy (Fig.\u00a06p\u2013t), or when administered directly to the neonatal pups (Fig.\u00a06h\u2013k). As revealed from its chemical structure in Fig.\u00a06a, the AHR ligand A18 belongs to the benzimidazole class of proton pump inhibitors, which also includes omeprazole43. These FDA-approved drugs are currently in clinical use for hyperacidity diseases, and could be conceivably repurposed for NEC, just as they have been repositioned as anticancer therapeutics44. The identification of the heterocyclic A18 as a potent AHR substrate reflects the broad range of hydrophobic structural motifs that bind to the AHR45. In seeking to understand the chemical mechanism of AHR binding so as to develop analogs for clinical use, we note that the indole nucleus is a privileged ligand for AHR46, suggesting that the benzimidazole core of A18 is the main pharmacophore for AHR activation. Major limits of A18 for clinical use in preventing NEC include the fact that while A18 is rapidly absorbed and approximately 97% bound in human plasma, it is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C18, and plasma elimination half-life is only approximately 2\u2009h in humans47, leaving much room for further improvement. I3C itself has limitations, including toxicity to the male urogenital tract when used at doses of 100\u2009mg per kg in utero, higher than the doses used in the current set of studies48. A18 will need to be modified in order to enhance its AHR signaling and clinical efficacy against NEC.",
                "The current findings have several potential points of impact on clinical medicine, by now showing that NEC may not only be a disease of the postnatal period, but may also reflect impaired signaling in the in utero environment through AHR. We also now provide for the opportunity to interfere with the molecular pathways that lead to the development of NEC through the intra-partum oral delivery of AHR ligands including I3C or A18. If confirmed in clinical studies, these findings may offer the unique ability to intervene in the setting of premature labor, by administering an AHR ligand that could serve to protect the gut and reduce the risk of NEC development in the neonate. In support of the possible success of a strategy in which antenatal delivery of AHR ligands may protect the neonate, it is noteworthy that pregnant women who adhered to a Mediterranean diet\u2014which is rich in AHR ligands\u2014were found to have significantly less NEC than mothers who did not adhere to a Mediterranean diet49. Taken in aggregate, the current findings offer the prospect of a renewed approach to NEC, and perhaps finally to a chance to alter the trajectory of this devastating disease."
