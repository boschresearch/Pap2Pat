                        "Imaging or sensing using terahertz electromagnetic radiation has emerged as a highly promising nondestructive evaluation technique for wide-ranging applications in agriculture and food science, communication, medical biology, and security screening. There is a growing need in the development of new THz devices to generate, detect and manipulate THz waves. However, it remains a challenging task for scaling up the manufacturing process of current designs of THz devices, particularly those with an ease of tuning in the THz-domain. In addition, most of the available THz materials are usually not transparent within the visible spectrum, which does not make them useful for broad applications.",
                        "It is therefore of great interest to develop a low-cost transformative manufacturing solution for THz devices, which can be functional in both visible and THz spectra with an ease of THz-domain modulating capability."

The LMF process comprises two steps: (1) applying ultrathin-film (e.g., in the order of nm as opposed to the micrometer regime) metal deposition on the dielectric substrate; and (2) creating a feature pattern on the metal film using nanosecond pulsed laser ablation. The resulting composite has newly integrated functional capabilities including: (a) highly conductive (e.g., at least 15 \u03a9/sq) sheet resistance, (b) optically transparent (e.g., at least 60% transmittance within visible spectrum), and (c) tunable bandpass filtering effect in the THz frequency range.

Two different metals, copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al), and two different glass-based substrate materials, soda-lime glass (abbreviated as \u201cglass\u201d) with a thickness of 1 mm and quartz with a thickness of 500 \u03bcm, were used respectively as metal film and substrate materials. Two different film deposition methods were respectively used for Cu and Al. For coating of the substrate with Cu film, pure Cu was deposited using the Angstrom Engineering's 6-pocket e-beam evaporator system. During the E-beam evaporation process, the thickness of the deposited metal was monitored in-situ by a piezoelectric thickness monitor. No intermediate layer (e.g., at least one layer 114 separating the metal film 102 and the dielectric substrate 108) was used on the substrate before the E-beam deposition process as it appeared that the Cu film did not detach from the glass-based substrate even after a long time storage in air.",

The deposition facility used was an IntlVac-Nanochrome I Sputterer. During the DC magnetron sputtering process, the power was set at 400 W and the Ar gas flow rate was 16.5 sccm. Using these two deposition techniques respectively, Cu and Al films with thickness of around 10 nm were deposited onto the substrates.",
                                "A 1,064 nm wavelength Q-Switched Nd:YAG nanosecond laser was selected for the second step of laser patterning. A 3-axis galvanometer laser scanner (SCANLAB intelliSCAN\u00ae 20 and varioSCANde 40i), configured with an f-theta objective, served to direct the laser beam with a beam size of \u02dc100 \u03bcm onto the sample. The substrate materials of glass or quartz were highly transparent at this laser wavelength and hence absorbs little laser energy during patterning. It was determined that the long pulse mode of 120 ns duration with a pulse energy on the order of hundreds of mJ would be appropriate for laser patterning of the ultrathin film. The nanosecond laser ablation/patterning of Cu thin films enabled material removal without inducing thermal damage of the underlying glass or quartz substrate, allowing for the metallic micro-hole array to be directly produced on the substrate. An optical micrograph of the laser patterned micro-hole array pattern is shown in FIG. 3. The current LMF process used a laser line spacing of \u02dc150 \u03bcm and a processing speed of \u02dc1.5 mm/s. It is noted that this work applied a high energy nanosecond laser with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The processing speed can be substantially increased by adopting higher pulse repetition lasers. A 36 mm\u00d736 mm area could be fabricated within 6 s using a nanosecond laser with a typical 10 kHz repetition rate. The high throughput of our laser texturing technique will enable large-area processing for industrial applications."

The temporal scan window was set large enough in order to accurately obtain the linewidths of the resonance features. By comparing the waveforms of air reference, pure quartz substrate, and quartz substrate coated with 8 nm-thick Cu film, notable different features can be found in these time-domain traces. First an apparent time delay could be found for the bipolar pulse feature in the waveform of pure quartz substrate compared with that of air reference because of the difference in their refractive indexes. Second, the air reference waveform exhibits an almost one cycle pulse which corresponds to the incident THz wave. For the waveforms of pure quartz substrate and quartz substrate coated with 8 nm-thick Cu film, there are several etalons after bipolar pulse. In comparison with the waveforms of pure quartz substrate and quartz substrate coated with 8 nm-thick Cu film, it appears that there are damped oscillatory waveform features present in the waveforms for laser patterned Cu film and the spectral features of the transmission resonances are contained in these oscillations. These oscillations can be attributed to the resonant interaction of the THz pulse with the periodic surface structure patterned on Cu film. In general, the magnitude of the oscillations corresponds to the magnitude of the resonance feature, while the oscillation duration corresponds to the linewidth of that feature. From Error! Reference source not found., it is apparent that the bipolar pulse feature in the waveforms of laser patterned Cu film shows a sign reversal relative to the waveform of pure quartz substrate. The sign reversal can be potentially attributed to the significant reshaping due to diffraction caused by the interaction between the incident THz pulse and laser patterned periodic hole array structure. As a result of this reshaping process, the transmitted THz pulse might exhibit an additional \u00b1\u03c0/2 phase shift in the low frequency limit. Thus the sign reversal of the transmitted time domain waveform would correspond to the phase shift imparted to a THz pulse transmitted through the laser patterned periodic hole array structure.",

However, the pure glass substrate only has an average THz transmission of 33% in the frequency range of 0.3\u02dc3 THz and its THz transmission intensity profile exhibits a significant drop in this frequency range. After 8 nm-thick Cu film was deposited on the pure quartz and glass substrates, the average THz transmission was decreased to 3% in the frequency range of 0.3\u02dc3 THz for both of the substrates, which can be found in Error! Reference source not found.b. To achieve THz filtering effect, it is required that the THz transmission profiles between the pure quartz substrate and 8 nm-thick Cu film coated on quartz substrate should have significant difference. The reason could be attributed to that if no difference can be found between these two transmission profiles, no transmission peak can be generated after laser patterning. Therefore our research showed that quartz is more suitable as the substrate required for achieving THz filtering effect. Thus in order to achieve the best combined properties of high transmittance, low sheet resistance and THz filtering effect, quartz and Cu are selected as the substrate material and metal film material respectively.",
                                "It should be noted that this work utilized ultra-thin metal film with a thickness on the order of \u02dc10 nm to efficiently block the THz wave. Although the AC complex conductivity of metals at THz frequencies is known for many decades, the skin depths of metals reported in literature are on the order of \u02dc100 nm. However, the thickness of the metal film used in this work is on the order of \u02dc10 nm, which is one magnitude lower than those reported in literature.",
                                "For the LMF experiments, two different sets of experimental parameters were used for laser patterning of Cu film: Pattern 1 used a laser beam diameter of 115 \u03bcm, a hole spacing of 135 \u03bcm and an areal density of 0.43; Pattern 2 used a laser beam diameter of 115 \u03bcm, a hole spacing of 160 \u03bcm and an areal density of 0.59. After LMF process, the LMF surfaces exhibited clear THz filtering effect with specific resonance frequency and the resonance frequency could be tuned by changing the experimental parameters, as shown in Error! Reference source not found.c. Since the Cu film was deposited on the quartz substrate, there are three interfaces surrounded this stacked structure: metal-air interface, quartz-air interface and metal-quartz interface. The metal-air interface and quartz-air interface were ignored when calculating the location of the resonant transmission peaks. The quartz substrate causes a downward shift in resonant frequency, which reaches a limiting value scaled by the square root of the mean dielectric constant 63. The equation that is used to calculate the approximate locations of the resonant transmission peaks is defined as Equation (1):",

                                "Using the above equation for calculation of the resonant transmission peaks and conversion between wavelength and frequency, the approximate locations of the resonant transmission peaks for both experimental conditions will be: 1.08\u02dc1.16 THz (wavelength of 259.7\u02dc276.7 \u03bcm) for Pattern 1 and 0.91\u02dc0.97 THz (wavelength of 307.8\u02dc327.9 \u03bcm) for Pattern 2. The experimental results indicate that the resonant transmission peak occurs at 1.09 THz (wavelength of 274.5 \u03bcm) for Pattern 1 and 0.90 THz (wavelength of 333.1 \u03bcm) for Pattern 2. The experimental results and theoretical calculations exhibit good agreement.",
                                "The experimental results show a secondary resonant transmission peak and a rather wide FWHM bandwidth, which is caused due to the following laser patterning defects. Firstly, laser patterned hole array exhibited distinct aperiodic nature, as can be found in FIG. 3. The imperfect periodicity of the laser pattered hole array was caused by the manufacturing inaccuracy during LMF process. Secondly it can be found that the geometry of the laser patterned spot is not perfectly circular. Thirdly, there are burrs generated around the hole circumference after LMF process, as discussed in the previous section. These burrs exhibit distinct heat-affected zones and will cause scattering effect and increase surface roughness. All of the above-mentioned factors contribute to the occurrence of the secondary peak and a relatively wide FWHM bandwidth of \u0394f=2 THz, which is far higher than the ideal FWHM bandwidth of 0.2\u02dc0.3 THz. By using a laser that generate high-quality Gaussian beam, the above issues are expected to be resolved, and thus the secondary resonant transmission peak can be removed and the FWHM bandwidth of the LMF surface can be much narrower, which will facilitate the design and fabrication of narrow-band THz filter.",
                                "Error! Reference source not found. shows the combined photoelectric properties for LMF surfaces for Pattern 1 and Pattern 2. Both of the visible transmittance and sheet resistance were measured for three times at various locations on a specimen and the average value with standard deviation was reported. It can be found that the two surfaces exhibit a visible transmittance of \u02dc60%, a sheet resistance of \u02dc20-30 \u03a9/sq and a specific resonance frequency with \u02dc2 THz FWHM bandwidth.",
                                "While not wishing to be bound by any specific theory, it is believed that the reason that the visible transmittance of the LMF surfaces fabricated on the quartz substrate is lower than that on the glass substrate could be attributed to: 1. The visible transmittance of quartz substrate is slightly lower than that of the glass substrate; 2. The thickness of the as-deposited films on different substrates is slightly different. In addition, it should be noted that even though the areal density of Pattern 2 is larger than that of Pattern 1, the visible transmittance of Pattern 2 is larger than that of Pattern 1 and the sheet resistance of Pattern 2 is higher than that of Pattern 1. This could be attributed to the fact that the thickness of the Cu film deposited on the quartz substrate of Pattern 1 is slightly higher than that of Pattern 2. Thus the visible transmittance of the as-deposited Cu film of Pattern 2 is around 4% higher than that of Pattern 1 and the sheet resistance of the as-deposited Cu film of Pattern 2 is 3.4 \u03a9/sq higher than that of Pattern 1. Therefore, even though the areal density of Pattern 2 is larger, the visible transmittance and sheet resistance of Pattern 2 are larger and higher than those of Pattern 1 due to the difference between the visible transmittance and sheet resistance of the as-deposited Cu films used for the two different patterns. Therefore, although the three combined photoelectric properties are not optimal and need further refinement, this LMF method has shown its great potential for fabrication of the multi-functional THz components.",
                                "From the THz spectra of two patterns, it is found that the peak transmission intensity of Pattern 1 is 67.4%, which is slightly higher than the peak intensity of 64.5% for Pattern 2. This could be attributed to the slight difference between the thicknesses of Cu films used for the two patterns. The Cu film for Pattern 1 is slightly thicker than that of Pattern 2. As a result, a higher peak transmission intensity is observed for the THz spectrum of Pattern 1 rather than Pattern 2. This phenomenon indicates that metal thickness plays a key in determining efficient THz transmission through laser patterned metal film. With higher metal film thickness, higher THz transmission intensity is facilitated. In addition to THz transmission performance, the electrical conductivity will be higher while the visible transmittance will be lower with higher film thickness, as discussed in the previous section. To balance the three properties, proper metal film thickness should be used in the LMF experiments. It is also found that the locations of resonant transmission peaks for Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 are different since different areal densities were used for these two patterns during LMF experiments. The experimental results indicate that areal density plays a key role in tuning the THz transmission of the LMF surface since the laser patterned hole spacing is determined by areal density which is the key parameter in Equation 1. Literature work indicates that the physically relevant parameter that determines extraordinary THz transmission properties is the hole size for a fixed hole periodicity. However, this work demonstrates that areal density can also play a role in modulating the THz transmission properties given the same laser patterned hole size. Therefore, metal film thickness and areal density are two key parameters that determines the combined performance of visible transmittance, electrical conductivity and THz filtering effect."

The other state-of-art nanofabrication methods usually involve many steps, which are time-consuming and costly for large area processing. For example, photolithography method has been applied for fabricating THz transmission subwavelength hole arrays, which involves at least six steps including ultrasonic cleaning, spin coating, soft-bake, UV exposure, chemical development and reactive ion etching. The production time for such a metasurface with metallic hole array is at least one magnitude longer than the LMF process. Further, photolithography methods give metamaterials that are not transparent in the visible spectrum. Therefore, the LMF process described herein makes metamaterials that are superior to those made by photolithography.",
                                "One key advantage of the LMF process is that it utilized a laser beam diameter on the order of several hundreds of \u03bcm during laser scanning of the thin metal film. Thus the processing efficiency has been significantly increased compared with the existing research work done by other type of nanosecond laser, picosecond laser or femtosecond laser, which used a laser beam diameter on the order of only several \u03bcm. It is expected that the laser beam diameter could be further increased to several millimeters while maintaining the similar laser fluence to further enhance the processing efficiency. Furthermore it should be noted that the LMF process just used an affordable nanosecond laser with a repetition rate of 10 Hz and thus currently it took around one hour to fabricate the transparent conducting film with an area of 36 cm\u00d736 cm. The processing speed can be significantly further optimized by using lasers with higher repetition rate. If a laser at 10 kHz pulse was used, the processing time could be reduced to 6 seconds. It should also be noticed that even with such high laser fluence, no structural deformation and damage were found on the quartz substrate. All of the above-mentioned advantages of this LMF process will render more practical treatment of glass-based materials to produce multi-functional THz components for various applications."
