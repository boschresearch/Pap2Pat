    "title": "Metabolomics as a Tool for Discovery of Biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Blood Plasma of Children",
    "date": "2014-11-07",
    "abstract": "Background The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the earliest age possible is important for initiating optimally effective intervention. In the United States the average age of diagnosis is 4 years. Identifying metabolic biomarker signatures of ASD from blood samples offers an opportunity for development of diagnostic tests for detection of ASD at an early age. Objectives To discover metabolic features present in plasma samples that can discriminate children with ASD from typically developing (TD) children. The ultimate goal is to identify and develop blood-based ASD biomarkers that can be validated in larger clinical trials and deployed to guide individualized therapy and treatment. Methods Blood plasma was obtained from children aged 4 to 6, 52 with ASD and 30 age-matched TD children. Samples were analyzed using 5 mass spectrometry-based methods designed to orthogonally measure a broad range of metabolites. Univariate, multivariate and machine learning methods were used to develop models to rank the importance of features that could distinguish ASD from TD. Results A set of 179 statistically significant features resulting from univariate analysis were used for multivariate modeling. Subsets of these features properly classified the ASD and TD samples in the 61-sample training set with average accuracies of 84% and 86%, and with a maximum accuracy of 81% in an independent 21-sample validation set. Conclusions This analysis of blood plasma metabolites resulted in the discovery of biomarkers that may be valuable in the diagnosis of young children with ASD. The results will form the basis for additional discovery and validation research for 1) determining biomarkers to develop diagnostic tests to detect ASD earlier and improve patient outcomes, 2) gaining new insight into the biochemical mechanisms of various subtypes of ASD 3) identifying biomolecular targets for new modes of therapy, and 4) providing the basis for individualized treatment recommendations.",

                "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, impaired verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive movements or circumscribed interests [1]. About 1 in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to estimates from CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. The current process for a clinical diagnosis includes establishing a developmental history and assessments of speech, language, intellectual abilities, and educational or vocational attainment. In practice, these methods lead to a diagnosis at an average age of 4 years [2] in the United States. It is recognized that establishing personalized therapy for children with ASD at the earliest age possible improves outcomes including a higher level of cognitive and social function and improved communication as well as decreased financial and emotional burden on families [3], [4]. Development of blood-based diagnostic tests to aid in the assessment of risk for a diagnosis of ASD at an early age would facilitate implementing intensive behavioral therapy at the earliest age possible.",
                "The etiology of the vast majority of cases of ASD are unknown and their genetics have proven to be incredibly complex [5], [6]. There is now widespread appreciation that there will be many causes of ASD with varying combinations of genetic and environmental risk factors at play. Numerous studies have attempted to identify the causes of the disorder by studying transcriptomics and genomics, leading to the identification of multiple genes associated with ASD [6], [7]. There are currently hundreds of observable genetic variants that account for about 20% of the cases of autism. These data are currently most useful in understanding the intra-familial genetics of autism. For this reason, clinical tests based on genomic measures often include genetic counseling to assess the chance of disease occurrence or recurrence within a family [8], [9]. Prediction accuracies of ASD risk based on genomic approaches range from 56% to 70% depending largely on the population of patients assessed. Separate analyses of at least one of the genomic studies by Skafidas et al. has questioned whether the results have been confounded by biases due to ancestral origins [10], [11]. An additional limitation of genomic studies is that the results of environmental influences on the child and/or mother are not discernible. Metabolomics is sensitive to biochemical changes caused by even subtle environmental influences and therefore can complement genomic approaches by addressing some of these factors that may be closer to phenotype.",
                "Given the complexities of the genetic environment of ASD, metabolomic profiling may provide an alternative path to developing early diagnostic tests. Previous metabolic studies of ASD have used biological matrices such as cells, organelles, urine and blood, and have implicated a wide range of metabolites including fatty acids, sterols, intermediary metabolites, phospholipids, and molecules associated with oxidative stress [12]\u2013[16]. Two recent reports highlight the potential use of metabolomic analysis of urine to identify signatures of ASD. One study used 1H-NMR methods and showed changes in metabolites associated with the tryptophan/nicotinic acid metabolic pathway, sulphur and amino acid pathways, as well as microbial metabolites implicating the involvement of microbial metabolism in the etiology of ASD [16]. Ming et al. used a combination of liquid- and gas-chromatography based mass spectrometry methods to identify changes in a number of amino acids and antioxidants such as carnosine, as well as confirming the changes associated with altered gut microbiomes [17].",
                "Measurement of metabolites offers an excellent opportunity to identify differences in small molecule abundance that may have the ability to characterize some forms of ASD. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is not only a very sensitive detection method for small molecule metabolites, it also provides accurate mass data that aids in metabolite identification through molecular formulae determination [18]. HRMS offers an additional distinct advantage in the ability to distinguish between compounds with the same nominal mass (isobaric compounds), providing enhanced chemical formula and structure information [19]. Unfortunately there is not one universal chromatographic mass spectrometric technique capable of detecting all of the metabolites in blood. To identify novel potential biomarkers associated with ASD, it is necessary to facilitate broad metabolite detection coverage. Toward this goal, we applied an orthogonal approach to chromatographic separation, mass spectral ionization and detection [20]. The current study employed multiple chromatographic mass spectrometric metabolomic methods including gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to discover a wide range of metabolites in blood plasma samples that were able to differentiate TD individuals from those with ASD. Subsequently, tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) experiments were employed to aid in structural confirmation of the metabolites discovered by LC-HRMS.",
                "The aim of the study was to perform a broad evaluation of small molecules in blood plasma to discover metabolites that may lead to biomarkers associated with ASD. Univariate, multivariate and machine learning methods were employed to discover metabolites or groups of metabolites exhibiting statistically significant abundance differences that can be used as biomarkers to distinguish children with ASD from TD individuals."

Institute Clinic, Regional Centers, referrals from clinicians, area school districts and community support groups such as Families for Early Autism Treatment (FEAT). Subjects were limited to an age range of 4\u20136 years. Typically developing participants were recruited from area school districts and community centers. All facets of this study were approved by the University of California at Davis Institutional Review Board (IRB). Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of each participant and data were analyzed without personal information identifiers then subjects completed diagnostic and psychological measures. Study participants with ASD were enrolled under inclusion criteria consisting of a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder based on the DSM-IV criteria determined by an experienced neuropsychologist (BAC), which was further corroborated by the following measures using research reliable clinicians: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) provides observation of a child's communication, reciprocal social interaction, and stereotyped behavior including an algorithm with cutoffs for autism and autism spectrum disorder; the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a comprehensive, semi-structured parent interview that assesses a child's developmental history and relevant ASD characteristic behaviors and generates a diagnostic algorithm for children with ASD. Based on the DSM-IV criteria [21], only children with strictly defined autistic disorder were enrolled whereas children with pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) or Asperger Syndrome were excluded from the study. The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) was used as a screening tool to ensure the absence of symptoms of ASD in the TD children. The patients recruited for this study were primarily Caucasian and the ages were similar between groups. However, the participants with autism had lower IQ scores than the TD subjects [22], [23].",

All subjects were screened via parental interview for current and past physical illness. Children with known endocrine, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and liver or kidney disease were excluded from enrollment in the study. Dietary restriction for participation in the study was not required with the exception of an overnight fast. Participation in the study required two clinical visits for behavioral assessment and blood draws. After application of exclusion criteria, the final study group consisted of 104 children, 69 with ASD and 35 in the TD group.",

Blood was drawn into a 9.6 mL EDTA Vaccutainer tube by an experienced pediatric phlebotomist between the hours of 8 and 10 AM following an overnight fast. Tubes were immediately inverted 6\u20138 times to assure mixing with the anticoagulant and placed on ice. Immediately after plasma separation and aliquoting, samples were sent on the morning of the draw via courier with a barcode label, wrapped tube cap with a strip of parafilm; bubble wrapped then set in a biohazard bag which was placed inside a carrier between coolant packs. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

Quality checks of the raw mass spectrometric data from the 98 samples were performed, resulting in removing data from 16 patient samples that did not contain MS data from all 5 methods from further analysis. The final 82 samples used in these studies originated from 52 children with ASD and 30 children in the TD group. The children were chosen so that the age and gender distributions were similar across the groups. There was no statistical difference in age between ASD cases and the TD children for the current study (Welch's t-test p\u200a=\u200a0.25) (see Table 1).",

Three of the 30 typical subjects were taking medications, which included methylphenidate (1), albuterol (1) and loratadine (1). Ten of the 52 ASD subjects were on a gluten and/or casein-free (GFCF) diet. Importantly, blood draws were administered prior to eating and any morning administration of any medication."

The HILIC LC-HRMS method resulted in the highest number of distinctive mass features in the models, followed by C8 LC-HRMS then GC-MS.

Based on the best performing model from each of the 100 nested CV resampling iterations, ROC plots were generated for the average of the 100 resamples to understand performance of each modeling method (SVM and PLS-DA). Both SVM and PLS modeling methods indicated that a metabolic signature could be detected that could classify children with ASD from TD individuals (Table S2). For the 61-sample training set, the average ASD prediction accuracy of the SVM model was 0.86, with AUC values of 0.95 (95% CI 0.94\u20130.96). The PLS model gave an average prediction accuracy of 0.84 with AUC values of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91\u20130.94). To confirm that the model classification accuracies were not random results, the modeling process was repeated with random permutations of the diagnosis class labels. These results showed near random classification, with AUC values of 0.52 (95% CI 0.48\u20130.57) and 0.52 (95% CI 0.49\u20130.56) for SVM and PLS, respectively, indicating that the 179 features did not discriminate the classes by chance (Figure 3).",

The feature sets were evaluated using feature subsets based on the ordered VIP scores of individual features to identify the minimum number of features that maximized performance for each modeling method (Table S2). These data together indicate that not all of the features contributed equally to the models and that the number of features could be reduced by removing those that contributed less while still retaining model accuracy and robustness. As a result, the entire set of 179 features was not required for optimal model performance for either of the modeling methods (Figure 3). The results from the model training process indicated that SVM models that were trained using an 80 feature set exhibited the best combined classification performance metrics (when compared to PLS and other SVM results) with an average accuracy of 90%, an average sensitivity of 92%, an average specificity of 87%, and an average AUC of 0.95 (Table S2)."

We used robust VIP scores and recursive feature elimination to estimate that between 80 and 160 mass features are required to produce an optimal predictive signature in this set of patients. The predictive signatures in this study are the result of modeling a 62-patient training set, then applying those models to predict a 21-patient validation set. This approach has resulted in the discovery of a biochemically diverse set of metabolites that might be useful in distinguishing individuals at risk for ASD. It is difficult to determine how generalizable these predictive signatures will be in the broader population, given the small sample size. Larger studies need to be performed in order to assess and refine a signature into a clinical diagnostic. Several of the metabolites identified so far in these signatures point to biological mechanisms that have been previously identified as having a role in the etiology of ASD. Our signatures will most likely represent a portion of the metabolic changes that will be critical in the diagnosis of ASD through metabolic end points."

When metabolism is disrupted, active transporters and tissue specific differences in metabolism can cause different levels of the same metabolites in different biological compartments (plasma, urine, CSF, etc.). When discussing individual metabolites in the context of autism, it is important to recognize that autism is a systemic disease that affects other organ systems besides the brain. For example, serotonin levels have been reported to be elevated in blood in some patients with autism, and other evidence suggests that intracerebral serotonergic activity is decreased in ASD. Serotonin does not cross the blood brain barrier, and the brain has different enzymes for serotonin synthesis than peripheral tissues [41].",

Homocitrulline is a poorly understood molecule which is known to be formed inside the mitochondria from lysine and carbamoyl phosphate. The decreased homocitrulline levels in the blood suggests that homocitrulline metabolism in the brain may also be disrupted, Homocitrulline levels are increased in urine and blood in patients with ornithine translocase (SLC25A15) deficiency which diverts carbamyl phosphate to react with lysine. These patients can exhibit behavioral abnormalities similar to ASD such as developmental delay, ataxia, spasticity, learning disabilities, cognitive deficits and/or unexplained seizures [57]. Rats treated with intracerebroventricular administration of homocitrulline are also observed to have disrupted brain redox status and energy metabolism [58], [59]. These observations suggest that elevated brain levels of homocitrulline are deleterious; however additional studies are needed to define the brain levels of homocitrulline and the potential role in the development of ASD."

The cohort of subjects enrolled in this study was carefully assembled to reflect a diagnosis of ASD by strict research criteria. Beyond careful clinical diagnosis, great pains were taken to ensure that fasting blood collection was obtained at the same time for all study participants and that complicating factors such as illness were minimized. We consider the current work as a proof of concept that there are predictive metabolic signatures which can be used to distinguish ASD and TD individuals.",
                "Two independent statistical classification methods (PLS and SVM) were employed to determine the most influential metabolites and mass features that could be used to discriminate between ASD and TD individuals. Both classification modeling methods yielded relatively similar results with respect to maximum prediction accuracy of about 81% as evaluated by an independent 21-sample validation sample set. This was followed by recursive feature elimination to establish the minimal numbers of features needed for a predictive model. Interestingly, several of the key features for classification, such as homocitrulline, were common between the two methods indicating their importance in the development of future blood based diagnostics. It is clear that access to a larger sample set will be required to further validate and confirm the annotations of the key features. Metabolomics determines changes in small molecule metabolites that are reactants and products of endogenous biochemical processes as well as small molecules derived from diet, the gut microbiome and contact with the environment. Perturbations in their abundance can result not only from genomic and proteomic influences, but from environmental and epigenetic influences as well. A metabolomic approach may therefore provide enhanced predictive results by keying in on common, end stage metabolites rather than on specific genomic or proteomic determinants."
