    "date": "2021-09-24 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Examples of systems and methods are described for detecting heart beats of a subject. The systems and methods may be based on motion of the subject due to cardiac activity, and may operate without contact with the subject. Example systems may provide an interrogation signal to the subject. Reflected signals from the subject are incident on a microphone array. The reflected signals may be processed and beamformed using a set of beamforming weights. The beamforming weights may be selected in a manner to reduce components of the reflected signals due to breathing motion of the subject while increasing the relative contribution of the reflected signals due to cardiac activity. The beamformed signal may provide a waveform indicative of heart beats. Inter-beat intervals, heart rates, and/or other health metrics may be calculated based on the waveform.",

                        "Heart rhythm assessment is used in diagnosis and management of many cardiac conditions and to study heart rate variability in healthy individuals. Clinical heart rhythm assessment depends on reliable acquisition of beat-to-beat intervals of the heart, also known as the R-R intervals. Physiologically, the R-R interval represents the time between successive ventricular depolarizations of the heart. Acquisition and assessment of R-R interval irregularity is used for diagnosing many cardiac arrhythmias and to study heart rate variability in healthy individuals. Although frequency domain analysis can estimate average heart rate in regular and quasi-periodic heart rhythm conditions, it fails when the rhythm is irregular, which is common in pathological conditions such as atrial fibrillation. R-R intervals are conventionally measured by identifying individual heart beats extracted using electrocardiography (ECG). This approach works for both regular and irregular rhythms but requires physical contact with the skin to operate."

In some instances, well-known circuits, control signals, timing protocols, and/or software operations have not been shown in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the described embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.",
                        "Examples of systems described herein may be used to acquire individual heart beats using smart speakers in a fully contact-free manner. Methods described herein can be considered to transform the smart speaker into a short-range active sonar system and measure heart rate and inter-beat intervals (e.g., R-R intervals) for both regular and irregular rhythms. In some examples, the smart speaker emits inaudible 18-22 kHz sound and receives echoes reflected from the human body that encode sub-mm displacements due to heart beats.",
                        "Smart speaker technology is rapidly evolving and may provide a reliant and convenient platform for the next generation of health monitoring solutions. Indeed, the increasing adoption of smart speakers in hospitals and homes could provide a mechanism to realize the potential for examples of contactless cardiac rhythm monitoring systems described herein.",
                        "A non-contact solution for heart rhythm monitoring may offer several advantages. It can monitor infectious and contagious patients where cleaning of contact-based devices can be time consuming and burdensome, monitor patients in home isolation and quarantine settings, and/or benefit patients with skin allergies who are intolerant to wearable and contact-based devices. Contactless rhythm acquisition may also be valuable in the modern telemedicine era, whereby patients' self-administered rhythm analysis are communicated to their physician. The benefits of a self-administered test are numerous, and may include the ability to connect patients living in rural areas to physicians, screening patients for atrial fibrillation remotely, and obtaining clinical trial data without the need for an in-person visit.",
                        "The widespread adoption of high quality smart speakers equipped with multiple microphones presents an opportunity for contactless monitoring of human body and internal organ functions. Google Nest smart devices can already determine a user's distance on its smart speaker by emitting soft, inaudible acoustic signals and analyzing their reflections from the human body. Apple HomePod and Amazon Echo devices support an array of six and seven microphones, respectively, that are used for sophisticated acoustic processing.",
                        "Examples described herein provide contactless system for monitoring cardiac rhythm using smart speakers that can identify individual heart beats in both regular and irregular rhythms. Examples of methods described herein may extract both heart rate and R-R intervals by generally transforming a smart speaker into a short-range active sonar system. An active sonar based approach to contactless monitoring has the distinct benefit of scalability vis-a-vis smart speakers. Unlike doppler radar and optical vibrocardiography, active sonar hardware components (e.g., multiple microphones and speaker) are ubiquitous in smart speakers. Further, in contrast to approaches that use facial photoplethysmographic signals, which raise privacy issues due to their use of cameras, active sonar can operate using inaudible acoustic signals and does not require the capturing of audible sounds.",
                        "Examples of methods and devices described herein generally include the use of a smart speaker to emit interrogation signals (e.g., 18-22 kHz inaudible sound signals) that are reflected off the human body and received by multiple microphones (e.g., a microphone-array). Methods are described to 1) analyze these signals and detect the subtle motion of the chest wall caused by the heart's apical impulse as well as by arterial pulsations on the body's surface, and 2) separate these signals from much larger breathing motions and ambient noise. An example smart speaker implementing these methods that is placed in front of a subject less than a meter away can identify individual heart beats and extract heart rate and R-R intervals for both healthy participants and patients with different cardiac abnormalities. This data could be used for studying heart rhythms, detecting cardiac arrhythmias, and determining heart rate variability.",
                        "The ability to monitor cardiac rhythm using smart speakers may raise privacy concerns. The short-range nature of active sonar examples described herein, however, can protect privacy since it uses the direct engagement and implicit consent of the user, who must be within a threshold distance (e.g., a meter) of the speaker and stay relatively still. Frequencies may be used for interrogation signals, e.g., 18-22 kHz acoustic frequencies, that contain little information about audible sounds in the environment. Finally, smart speaker manufacturers generally do not give third party app developers access to raw acoustic signals from individual microphones. Consequently, the smart speaker manufacturers can implement and deploy this capability in a manner that balances the needs and concerns of patients, health care providers and privacy advocates.",
                        "A variety of challenges may be presented in endeavoring to measure heart rhythms, including irregular heart rhythms in a contactless system (e.g., a system in which the subject is not contacting an electrode or other contact sensor used to measure heart rhythm). If heart beats were regular, frequency domain analysis may be used to extract the heart motion from the fundamental frequency and its harmonic components. This approach however may not work with irregular heart rhythm since there is no well-defined peak in the frequency domain and the energy is spread across a range of frequencies. Extracting irregular beats may be difficult using acoustic signals since heart beats result in a 0.3-0.8 mm motion on the surface of the human body; this is an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of sound at operational frequencies described herein. Further, commodity smart speakers are designed primarily to transmit in the audible frequencies, and the inaudible frequencies they support have a limited bandwidth\u20144 kHz bandwidth across 18-22 kHz\u2014with a non-ideal frequency response. Unlike ultrasonic devices, commodity smart devices also have a limited sampling rate, about 48 kHz, that produces a low signal-to-noise ratio, making it difficult to achieve the high temporal resolution used to measure the precise timing of each heartbeat. Another complicating factor may be that breathing creates a much larger motion than heart beats on the surface of the body. Though respiration rates are typically lower than heart rates, respiration is not a perfect sinusoidal motion since inhalation and exhalation durations can differ. This creates high frequency components in the breathing motion that interfere with the minute heart beat motion. At low signal-to-noise ratios, this prevents the latter from being reliably separated in the frequency domain using filtering; when the heart signal is weak and overwhelmed by interference from breathing motion, it can become challenging to extract individual heart beats in irregular rhythm.",

The weights may be calculated such that the waveform generated using the weighted combination of reflected signals is indicative of heart beats of the subject.",
                        "Generally, during beamforming 210, the heart rhythm present in the received signals may be separated from breathing motion. Heart rhythm can be irregular, and breathing motion may not be a perfect sinusoidal signal. Therefore, filtering alone may not be effective. Beamforming 210 generally maximizes the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) by aligning heart beat signals across microphones and frequencies while minimizing the interference from breathing motion and noise. The beamformer (e.g., using processor 118 of FIG. 1) uses complex weights (e.g., weights 130) to combine the signals from different microphones across frequencies. To compute the weights, a function may be used (e.g., function 132), which may be an optimization function. The function may be solved using a gradient ascent algorithm or other learning algorithm. Since there is no assumption of periodic structure to the heart rhythm, the learning algorithm can erroneously detect high-frequency, impulse-like signals caused by abrupt breaths or interference in the environment. Regularization parameters in the function may be used to penalize such abrupt changes.",
                        "To help understand why an adaptive beamformer is used, a discussion is provided on how reflected signals due to breathing motion may interfere with reflected signals due to the heart motion. The received acoustic signal at each microphone is a superposition of reflections from various reflectors on the subject, including the chest, abdomen and neck as well as reflections from static objects and noise. Assuming that breathing and heartbeats result in a displacement of approximately 0.5 cm and 0.5 mm, respectively, this results in a phase change of around 3.3 and a 0.3 radian in the acoustic signal. Thus, the received acoustic signal in the complex domain (e.g., the received signals from the microphones of electronic devices described herein, either before or after echo suppression) can be represented as a linear combination of complex numbers corresponding to two arcs, the respiration arc, and the heartbeat arc, in addition to a constant complex offset from static reflections and noise.",

Other frequencies may be used for other types of subjects. Projecting an ideal breathing signal onto the real and imaginary components results in sinusoidal waves. However, the breathing motion is not perfectly sinusoidal in practice. As a result, while the majority of breathing energy in the frequency domain is at Rresp and its second harmonic (<40 CPM), a non-negligible portion of energy may leak into the higher frequencies that correspond to heart motion.",
                        "A heartbeat arc in comparison may be much smaller, and the moving trajectory along each heartbeat arc can thus be approximated as a linear segment. Hence, the projection of the motion along the arc onto the real or imaginary axis is approximately linear to the motion itself. Human heartbeat motion has a mean frequency (Rheart) between 60-150 CPM. Other frequencies may be used in other kinds of subjects. However, the instantaneous heart rate, which is the reciprocal of the R-R interval, is not necessarily quasi-static.",

First, a non-negligible minority of the energy corresponding to breathing and heart motion can leak between these frequency ranges. Since the respiration motion is much larger than heartbeat motion, it introduces noise in the 60 to 150 cycles per minute frequencies in some subjects and can hide the heartbeat signal. As a result, band-pass filtering may not help to extract heart rhythm from the active sonar signal. Instead, beamforming may be used.

The segmentation operation may accordingly combine data from both the in-phase and quadrature phase components of the beamformed waveform.",
                        "The complex signal, Sheart, may be segmented into portions corresponding to individual heart beats. Recall imperfect beamforming may leave residual interference from respiratory motion that modulates the heart signal. This may introduce a rotation to the waveform indicative of heart beats, which may change the projection ratio between the real and imaginary components. Thus, the heartbeats may not be observed only on the real (in-phase) or imaginary (quadrature) components (see FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B). Choosing local peaks from the absolute values of Sheart may not accurately segment the heart beats since the residual noise from the high-pass filter creates fake peaks; a more restrictive band-pass filter could reduce this noise but may also reduce temporal resolution.",
                        "Accordingly, a segmentation technique may be used in segmentation 212 that finds both the segmenting points and the rotation of each segment simultaneously. The shapes of consequent heartbeat arcs may be similar after accounting for temporal scaling due to different R-R intervals and a rotation between them due to residual breathing motion. The technique finds the segmenting point and the corresponding rotation transformation for each segment, where one segment post-rotation is most similar to its previous segment after scaling to be the same duration. The segmentation method may be non-iterative, may account for rotations, and may rely on comparison only between adjacent segments.",

In some examples, the indication to start monitoring may be received through a user interface, such as user interface 128 of FIG. 1.

Higher median R-R intervals correspond to higher 90-percentile error. There was no noticeable decrease in accuracy among those with irregular rhythms compared to those with regular rhythms. Within the context of clinical practice, it is unlikely that this magnitude of error would result in diagnostic errors for detecting atrial fibrillation where R-R interval variation less than 50 ms is often not clinically important. In atrial fibrillation, the R-R interval widely varies from beat to beat and standard deviations range between 95-233 ms in different physiological states.

The hospitalized population had a mean age of 63.2 years in the regular rhythm group and 68.0 in the irregular rhythm group, and there were a total of 5 out of 24 patients with diabetes. In addition, medications that influence vagal tone, such as beta blockers, digoxin, opiate pain medications may decrease sinus arrhythmia.
