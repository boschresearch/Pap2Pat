                        "Drug delivery to the brain is hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB endothelium is very impermeable and allows only those molecules that have combined properties of low molecular weight (<500 Da) and lipophilicity to enter the brain from the bloodstream. Even molecules with such attributes may be effluxed as substrates for p-glycoprotein or similar transporters. Taken together, these BBB properties conspire to restrict BBB passage of greater than 98% of small molecule pharmaceuticals and nearly 100% of all protein and gene therapeutics. However, if antibodies are used to target receptor-mediated transport systems at the BBB, drug molecules and drug carriers can be effectively transcytosed across the BBB endothelium into brain tissue. Such noninvasive delivery from blood to brain is a result of the antibody acting as a surrogate ligand for the endogenous transport systems. Current known antibody-targeted brain delivery systems include the transferrin and insulin receptor systems. These are expressed ubiquitously throughout the body and lead to mis-targeting of expensive pharmaceuticals.",
                        "Receptor-ligand recognition and binding frequently depend on pH-induced changes stemming from the combined protonation states of amino acids within the protein. Histidine is considered a key amino acid driving pH sensitivity having a side-chain pKa of 5.5-6.5 in the context of proteins [1]. Evidence suggests that proteins have adapted to function in a range of subcellular pH environments through non-random placement of histidine residues [2]. These phenomena have been exploited in therapeutic protein design to alter intracellular trafficking. For example, interactions with the neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), which functions in a pH dependent manner to regulate serum IgG levels [3], have been modified. The Fc region surrounding critical histidine residues of the monoclonal antibody Motavizumab was mutated improving FcRn binding at pH 6.0 without affecting its affinity at pH 7.2, thereby achieving a 4-fold extension in serum half-life [4-6]. In contrast, desiring a reduction in therapeutic IgG serum half-life, a competitive antibody, or \u201cAbdeg\u201d, was created to bind FcRn tightly at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.2, hence occupying FcRn at the expense of therapeutic antibody binding [7]. While these studies describe the modulation of a preexisting pH-dependent system, it is also possible to introduce pH-sensitive binding. As examples, both the anti-IL6R antibody Tocilizumab [8], and the anti-PCSK9 antibody RN316 [9] were engineered to escape target-mediated degradation by introducing histidine residues at select positions in the antibody CDR loops, so as to induce antibody-antigen dissociation at endosomal pH. Engineering pH-sensitive ligand binding has also been employed to increase the potency of non-immunoglobulin scaffolds as in the case of the cytokine GCSF [10], and the iron carrier protein transferrin [11].",
                        "The transferrin receptor (TfR) presents a valuable therapeutic target which can be antagonized directly, or exploited indirectly as an intracellular drug delivery vector. These opportunities result from the ubiquitous expression of TfR on normal cells and elevated expression on cancer cells, as well as the endocytotic route used to transport iron-bearing transferrin inside the cell (reviewed in [12,13]). The natural ligand for TfR, the serum protein transferrin (Tf), circulates in iron-free (apoTf) or iron-bound (holoTf) forms [14,15]. HoloTf binds the transferrin receptor (TfR) tightly at blood pH (7.2-7.4), and the complex is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [16]. As holoTf-TfR complexes cycle though acidic endosomes (pH 5.0-6.0), an intricately coordinated series of pH-induced conformational changes induces the release of both iron molecules to yield apoTf, which has an increased affinity for TfR at endosomal pH [15,17-19]. This is followed by recycling of the apoTf-TfR complex to the cell surface (pH 7.2-7.4) where apoTf has a decreased affinity for TfR and dissociates back into the blood stream [17,20]. Cytotoxins based on conjugates of transferrin have been widely studied as therapeutic agents [21]. A detailed kinetic model of the TfR cycle was created and analyzed for routes that might lead to a greater overall cellular association of Tf or Tf conjugates [11]. It was posited that inhibition of iron release from Tf could lead to endosomal dissociation of holoTf that, unlike apoTf, could rapidly rebind at blood pH and participate in further cycles of endocytosis at blood pH [11,17]. Indeed, when Tf was genetically altered to inhibit iron release, diphtheria toxin conjugates of the mutant Tf showed increased cytotoxicity compared to wild-type Tf conjugates [22]. Similarly, it has been shown that improved cytotoxin efficacy for Tf conjugates as well as anti-TfR antibodies is a direct result of increased cellular association [23-25].",
                        "Needed in the art is an antibody with pH-sensitive binding capability. Specifically, needed in the art are anti-TfR antibodies that bind TfR in a pH-dependent manner. For example, the needed antibodies could bind TfR at physiological pH and could release TfR rapidly at endosomal pH."

As the most variable parts of the molecules, CDRs are crucial to the diversity of antigen specificities generated by lymphocytes. There are three CDRs (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3), arranged non-consecutively, on the amino acid sequence of a variable domain of an antigen receptor. Since the antigen receptors are typically composed of two variable domains (on two different polypeptide chains, heavy and light chain), there are six CDRs for each antigen receptor that can collectively come into contact with the antigen. A single antibody molecule has two antigen receptors and therefore contains twelve CDRs. Sixty CDRs can be found on a pentameric IgM molecule.",
                        "Within the variable domain, CDR1 and CDR2 may be found in the variable (V) region of a polypeptide chain, and CDR3 includes some of V, all of diversity (D, heavy chains only) and joining (J) regions. Since most sequence variation associated with immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is found in the CDRs, these regions are sometimes referred to as hypervariable regions. Among these, CDR3 shows the greatest variability as it is encoded by a recombination of the VJ in the case of a light chain region and VDJ in the case of heavy chain regions. The tertiary structure of an antibody is important to analyze and design new antibodies.",

As a non-limiting example, an anti-TfR antibody of the invention may be selected for or engineered to have pH-sensitive binding to TfR such that it binds with desirably higher affinity (as described herein) to cell surface TfR at physiological pH 7.4, but upon internalization into an endosomal compartment, rapidly dissociates from TfR at the relatively lower pH (pH 5.5-6.0). Such dissociation may protect the antibody from antigen-mediated clearance and increase the amount of antibody that is either internalized into the target cell or transported across the target cell in the case of a barrier forming cell type. In either case, the effective concentration of the antibody is increased relative to an anti-TfR antibody that does not comprise such pH sensitivity (see, e.g., Chaparro-Riggers et al. J. Biol. Chem. 287(14): 11090-11097; Igawa et al., Nature Biotechnol. 28(11): 1203-1208).",

TfR may be needed for the import of iron into the cell and is regulated in response to intracellular iron concentration. TfR may import iron by internalizing the transferrin-iron complex through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The existence of a receptor for transferrin iron uptake had been recognized over half a century back. Earlier two transferrin receptors in humans, transferrin receptor 1 and transferrin receptor 2 had been characterized and till recently cellular iron uptake was believed to occur chiefly via these two well documented transferrin receptors. Both these receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins.",
                        "TfR1 is a high affinity ubiquitously expressed receptor. Expression of TfR2 is restricted to certain cell types and is unaffected by intracellular iron concentrations. TfR2 binds to transferrin with a 25-30 fold lower affinity than TfR1. Although TfR1 mediated iron uptake is the major pathway for iron acquisition by most cells and especially developing erythrocytes, several studies have indicated that the uptake mechanism varies depending upon the cell type. It is also reported that Tf uptake, independent of these TfRs exists although the mechanisms are not well characterized. The multifunctional glycolytic enzyme Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) has been shown to utilize post translational modifications to exhibit higher order moonlighting behavior wherein it switches its function as a holo or apo transferrin receptor leading to either iron delivery or iron export respectively.",

Endocytosis and its counterpart, exocytosis, are used by all cells because most chemical substances important to them are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the hydrophobic plasma or cell membrane by passive means. Endocytosis may include pinocytosis (cell drinking) and phagocytosis (cell eating).",

A protein of interest may be displayed as a fusion to the Aga2p protein on the surface of yeast. The Aga2p protein is naturally used by yeast to mediate cell-cell contacts during yeast cell mating. As such, display of a protein via Aga2p projects the protein away from the cell surface, minimizing potential interactions with other molecules on the yeast cell wall. The use of magnetic separation and flow cytometry in conjunction with a yeast display library is a highly effective method to isolate high affinity protein ligands against nearly any receptor through directed evolution.",

The linker may usually be rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as serine or threonine for solubility, and can either connect the N-terminus of the VH with the C-terminus of the VL, or vice versa.

                                "The equilibrium binding affinity of receptor-ligand or antibody-antigen pairs may be modulated by protonation of histidine side-chains, and such pH-dependent mechanisms play important roles in biological systems, affecting molecular uptake and trafficking. Here, we aimed to manipulate cellular transport of single-chain antibodies (scFvs) against the transferrin receptor (TfR) by engineering pH-dependent antigen binding. An anti-TfR scFv was subjected to histidine saturation mutagenesis of a single CDR. By employing yeast surface display with a pH-dependent screening pressure, scFvs having markedly increased dissociation from TfR at pH 5.5 were identified. The pH-sensitivity generally resulted from a central cluster of histidine residues in CDRH1. When soluble, pH-sensitive, scFv clone M16 was dosed onto live cells, the internalized fraction was 2.6-fold greater than scFvs that lacked pH-sensitive binding and the increase was dependent on endosomal acidification. Differences in the intracellular distribution of M16 were also observed consistent with an intracellular decoupling of the scFv M16-TfR complex. Engineered pH-sensitive TfR binding could prove important for increasing the effectiveness of TfR-targeted antibodies seeking to exploit endocytosis or transcytosis for drug delivery purposes.",
                                "Here we reasoned that the intracellular accumulation of an anti-TfR antibody could be increased by engineering enhanced dissociation from TfR at endosomal pH, thereby decoupling antibody uptake from post-internalization TfR trafficking dynamics. To test this hypothesis, an anti-TfR single-chain antibody (scFv) was subjected to histidine-saturation mutagenesis at a single CDR known to participate in TfR binding, and the resultant library was screened. These methods resulted in an scFv, M16, that exhibited rapid dissociation at endosomal pH, while maintaining a high affinity for TfR at neutral pH. When dosed onto proliferating cancer cells, M16 displayed greater total cellular association than the wild-89 type scFv H7, which could be attributed to elevated intracellular accumulation. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed markedly different patterns of accumulation for scFv M16, indicating a departure in trafficking from the canonical Tf-TfR pathway.",

                                "The scFv H7 against human transferrin receptor was a kind gift from Dr. James Marks at the University of California-San Francisco [31]. The negative control for surface display and soluble scFv assays was an anti-hen egg lysozyme antibody, scFv D1.3 [32]. scFv H7 was previously subcloned into the pCT-ESO backbone to create the plasmid 118 pESO-H7 [33]. pESO H7 formed the basis for constructing a recombinant, histidine-saturation library focused on scFv H7 CDRH1. To allow homologous recombination (and to preemptively silence any yeast receiving reclosed vector during the transformation), site-directed mutagenesis was used to create a unique restriction enzyme site (SpeI) followed by a double stop codon in the middle of CDRH1. Briefly, Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) was used to linearly amplify and mutate the pESO-H7 template with primers H7sdmF 5\u2032-GCCTCTCGATTCACCTTCACTAGTTAATAAATGCACTGGGTCCGC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:29) and H7sdmR 5\u2032-CTGGCGGACCCAGTGCATTTATTAACTAGTGAAGGTGAATCGAGAGGCCAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:30). The resulting PCR product was digested with DpnI (NEB), ethanol precipitated in the presence of sodium acetate and pellet paint (Covagen), rehydrated in 1\u00d7 TE, and digested with DpnI a second time. After successful transformation into XL1 Blue Supercompetent cells (Agilent) following the manufacturer's protocol, plasmid DNA was rescued from individual colonies using the Zyppy kit (Zymo Research), and introduction of the desired mutations comprising pESO132 H7sdm (FIG. 1A) was verified with bi-directional sequencing using the primers BTSeqF 5\u2032-CTGCTCCGAACAATAAAGATTCTAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:31) and BTSeqR 5\u2032-GTATGTGTAAAGTTGGTAACGGAAC-3\u2032(SEQ ID NO:32).",
                                "FIGS. 1(A and B) shows creation and screening methodology for a histidine-saturated CDRH1 library based on the wild-type anti-TfR scFv, H7. As shown in FIG. 1A, the pESO-H7sdm vector contained the coding sequence for wild-type scFv H7, harboring a unique restriction site (SpeI) followed by two stop codons in CDRH1. SpeI digestion of pESO-H7sdm produced a linearized backbone that would be undetectable by flow cytometry if introduced as a reclosed vector into yeast. A double-stranded DNA cassette containing the histidine-saturated CDRH1 was built using two cycles of PCR, from primers and a degenerate oligonucleotide (IP90T). Although depicted as a single entity for simplicity, IP90T was in fact a mixture of millions of unique 143 ssDNA oligos representing all possible combinations of histidine in CDRH1. The CDRH1his cassette and linearized pESO-H7sdm were used to create the CDRH1his library by homologous recombination in yeast.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 1B, screening and assessment of yeast-displayed scFvs was accomplished by saturating with recombinant human transferrin receptor (rhTfR) followed by a 10 minute incubation in acidic buffer (pH 4.0-6.5) and assay for TfR dissociation. A pH 5.5 buffer was used to simulate endosomal conditions relevant to transferrin-TfR dissociation [19, 20]. A dissociation control was included by using a pH 7.4 buffer as opposed to acidic buffer at this step. The dissociation process was halted by addition of an excess volume of ice cold pH 7.4 buffer. Surface constructs were subsequently immunolabeled and analyzed by flow cytometry. The histogram depicts the response of yeast-displayed wild-type scFv H7 to 10 minute incubation with buffers having acidic pH.",
                                "Next, a DNA cassette containing the histidine-saturated CDRH1 was fabricated from a 90 bp oligonucleotide mix and two complementary oligonucleotide primers. The 90 bp mixed oligonucleotide DNA (purchased from IDT) was designed using degenerate bases, allowing the possibility of histidine at every codon in CDRH1, while maintaining 30 bp homology to wild-type scFv H7 at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends (IP90T 5\u2032-AGGTCCCTGAGACTCTCCTGTGCAGCCTCTCRWYWCMMCYWCMRTMRCYATSMTMWKCACTGGGTCCGCCAGGCTCCAGGCAAGGGGCTG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:33), where S=G/C, R=A/G, Y=C/T, K=G/T, M=A/C, W=A/T). IP90T was made double-stranded and extended to 100 bp via 5 cycles of standard PCR with OneTaq 2\u00d7 GC Master Mix (NEB) and a single primer IPCDH1ampF 5\u2032-CCACCCACTCCAGCCCCTTGCCTGGAGC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:34) (FIG. 1a). The size and homogeneity of the product were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. A DNA Clean and Concentrate 5 kit (Zymo Research) was used to purify the 100 bp PCR product. The final mutagenic DNA cassette was produced by a second PCR reaction with OneTaq 168 2\u00d7 GC Master Mix using the first PCR product as a template and the primers IPCDH1ampF and IPCDH1ampR 5\u2032-CCAGCCTGGGAGGTCCCTGAGACTCTCCTGTGC-3\u2032(SEQ ID NO:35).

                                "Finally, the H7CDRH1his library was created by electroporation and homologous recombination of the histidine-saturated 120 bp mutagenic DNA cassette, and the (SpeI) linearized pESO-H7sdm acceptor vector in yeast [34, 35] (FIG. 1A). Library size was determined by plating serial dilutions and colony counting. A dozen yeast colonies were selected at random and plasmid DNA was rescued with the Zymoprep II kit (Zymo Research). The type (histidine or non-histidine) and distribution of mutations in the scFv H7 were ascertained by sequencing as described above. All mutations were found confined to the CDRH1 (Table 1).",

Particle-bound scFv was detected using a DyLight650-conjugated anti-his6 antibody (Abcam, ab117504, diluted 1:300 in TBSA). rhTfR binding was detected by mouse anti-hTfR PE conjugate (FAB2474P, R&D systems, diluted 1:10 in TBSA). MFIs of the labeled beads were quantified using FlowJo; the bound rhTfR per scFv on the bead was determined as the ratio of PE fluorescence (TfR binding) divided by the DyLight650 fluorescence (scFv amount). Specific, pH-driven dissociation of rhTfR was then calculated by dividing the bound rhTfR per scFv at pH 5.5 by that at pH 7.4.",

After saturation of yeast-displayed H7 with recombinant human TfR (rhTfR) at neutral pH, yeast were exchanged into acidic buffer (pH 4.0-6.5) for 10 minutes to allow for TfR dissociation, and the fraction of TfR remaining bound was assessed by flow cytometry. H7 was found to dissociate from TfR in a pH-dependent manner, particularly at pH 5.0 and below where TfR binding was almost completely abolished (FIG. 1B, histogram). However, at pH 5.5, TfR binding was decreased by just 44% compared to the level observed at pH 7.4 (FIGS. 1B, 2, and 3A). Thus, there was a clear opportunity for engineering scFvs having a more rapid (<10 min) dissociation from TfR at pH 5.5, conditions chosen based on their relevance to endogenous transferrin-TfR trafficking [19, 20, 38].",

                                "Previously, a number of scFv H7 variants were isolated possessing improved equilibrium binding affinity at neutral pH [33]. Sequence analysis of randomly selected clones from the affinity-matured pools revealed a strong bias (20 out of 27 unique mutations) toward amino acid changes in the heavy chain, including CDRH1 and CDRH2 [33], suggesting a direct role for each of these two CDRs in TfR binding. However, amongst mutations affecting the most substantial affinity enhancement, those located in CDRH2 predominated, indicating a comparatively important role for CDRH2 in mediating TfR binding at neutral pH. Thus, CDRH1 was chosen as a locus for engineering an scFv with increased dissociation from TfR at pH 5.5. Given that multiple histidine substitutions in combination have been shown to be particularly effective at imparting pH-sensitive antigen binding [39], a recombinant library was designed to saturate CDRH1 with all combinations of histidine, from a single histidine at each position to ten consecutive histidines (FIG. 1a and Materials and Methods). The resulting H7 CDRH1his yeast display library comprised 3\u00d7107 clones and substantially oversampled the theoretical diversity (1.8\u00d7105) arising from designed nucleotide degeneracy. Sequencing of 12 randomly selected clones from the unselected library indicated a rich mix of histidine mutations in CDRH1, both in number and position (Table 1).",

Evaluating the response (full length-display and antigen binding) of the starting library to this treatment yielded two key observations. First, at pH 7.4, approximately 40% of the library clones retained substantial TfR binding despite mutations to the CDRH1 loop (FIG. 2B, gate F). Second, when incubated at pH 5.5 for 10 minutes, many of the clones dissociated from TfR as desired, but a sizable population (\u02dc20%) remained bound (FIG. 2C, gate F). H7 was comparatively less responsive to pH 5.5 treatment (FIG. 2E and FIG. 7). Given these responses, we proceeded to screen for both pH-insensitive and pH-sensitive mutants.",

                                "Since it was desired to maintain anti-TfR potency at neutral pH, two initial rounds of FACS-based sorting were performed at pH 7.4 to purify TfR binders from the CDRH1his library (FIG. 2B, gate F). The resulting functional pool, \u201cF\u201d, was essentially free from scFv mutants with impaired TfR binding at neutral pH (FIG. 2D), while still containing scFvs capable of the desired TfR dissociation at pH 5.5 (FIG. 2f). Subsequently, to isolate pH-sensitive TfR binders, pool F was sorted using gate \u201cM\u201d, bracketed on the high end by the H7, pH 5.5 TfR binding signal, and on the low end by the no-antigen control (FIGS. 2E-F and 7). Two rounds of FACS sorting in this fashion, yielded pool \u201cM\u201d, a population with significantly attenuated TfR binding after 10 minutes at pH 5.5 (FIG. 2H). In parallel, a second non-overlapping gate, N, was added above the M gate. Clones in pool \u201cN\u201d exhibited increased retention of TfR binding compared to H7 at pH 5.5 (FIGS. 2G and 7). In contrast to the pH-sensitive M pool, clones in the N pool maintained strong association with TfR at pH 5.5 and represented a class of pH-insensitive, TfR binding, scFvs. Finally, pH-insensitive binders were isolated directly from the CDRH1his library without going through the F pool as an intermediate (FIG. 7).

Those clones exhibiting the desired pH sensitivity (M) or insensitivity (N and 5P) were sequenced to evaluate histidine substitution in the engineered CDRH1s. The pattern of histidine substitution in unique clones from pH sensitive pool M was distinct from that found in the N and 5P clones with a strong bias toward histidine in at least three of the central positions (VH31-VH34) of CDRH1 (Table 1). Additionally, this central histidine core was accompanied by the mutation of at least one of the adjacent residues (VH30 or VH35) to proline in the majority of the M clones (e.g. Table 1, clones M8 and M16). In contrast, none of the unique clones analyzed from the pH-insensitive N or 5P pools contained either of these features. Instead, the wild-type serines at VH32 and VH33 were often mutated to arginine or asparagine, with any newly added histidines appearing away from the VH31-VH34 \u201ccore\u201d at either VH30 or VH35 (e.g. clones N4 and 5P4 in Table 1c). N and 5P series clones also had, on average, fewer total mutations than their M series counterparts (37% versus 64%), and a wild-type tyrosine at position VH34 that remained invariant.",

When applied to the human breast cancer cell line (SK-BR-3), scFvs bound to the cell surface and were internalized. Monomeric scFvs were dosed onto SK-BR-3 cells and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours to allow for binding and internalization. H7 and N5 tended to bind the periphery of cells, with some punctate localization just inside the cell membrane compared to M16 which had reduced surface labeling in favor of distinct, intracellular structures with qualitatively elevated concentrations of scFv (FIG. 4B). If scFvs were first pre-dimerized, a similar distribution was observed (FIG. 4B). A two fluorophore immunolabeling procedure was employed to unequivocally demonstrate binding and internalization of M16, N5 and H7. As suggested by the single color immunolabeling (FIG. 4B), binding and internalization were both clearly observed for each scFv (FIG. 5A). The intracellular staining for scFv M16 was unique, however, showing a significant number of large, punctate, vesicular structures, while H7 and N5 yielded smaller membrane localized structures (FIG. 5A).",

Compared to H7, N5 had, on average, 20% less total cellular association (FIG. 5B, p<0.001), while the levels of total cellular association for scFv M16 were 1.5-fold higher (FIG. 5B, p<0.001). To directly quantify the internalized fraction, we capitalized on the fact that TfR contains a membrane-proximal trypsin cleavage site which can be used to remove surface exposed TfR along with any scFv that might be bound [40]. When trypsinized cell samples were assayed by flow cytometry the levels of internalized scFv M16 were 2.6-fold greater than wild-type H7 as a result of more total cellular association (1.5-fold) and a higher fraction of cell-associated scFv being found internally (87%) (FIG. 5b, p<0.001). N5 and H7 on the other hand, were quite similar in terms of percentage of total cell-associated scFv internalized (FIG. 5B, 52% of total H7 was internalized, and 56% of total N5 was internalized). Taken together, these data confirmed the enhanced internalization of M16 compared with N5 and H7 as previously suggested qualitatively by the immunocytochemistry images. In order to examine whether pH-dependent phenomena were driving the difference in increased scFv M16 internalization, the amount of internalized scFv was monitored after treatment with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of endosomal-lysosomal acidification [41,42]. In contrast with the untreated, control samples where scFv M16 internalized at levels 2.5-fold greater than wild-type H7 (FIG. 5c, p<0.001), treatment with BafA1 completely removed the beneficial effects of M16 on internalization such that it showed no difference in internalization in comparison to wild-type H7 or scFv N5 (FIG. 5c, p>0.05). These results indicate that endosomal acidification is required to observe the beneficial internalization properties of M16, confirming the important role of pH-sensitive binding.",
                                "Finally, the co-localization of internalized scFvs with markers of intracellular compartments was evaluated to determine what alterations in antibody trafficking were responsible for the increased internalization behavior of M16. H7, M16 and N5, all showed isolated areas of co-localization with the endosomal marker EEA1 (FIG. 6A), and the late endosomal/lysosomal markers LAMP1 (FIG. 6B) and LAMP2 (FIG. 6C). Quantitative co-localization analysis did not suggest that pH-sensitivity dramatically shifted trafficking away from the lysosome (LAMP1 or LAMP2) and towards the endosome (EEA1), or vice versa (FIG. 6D). Instead, the Pearson correlation coefficients suggested that co-localization of pH-sensitive M16 with each of the three intracellular markers was uniformly reduced compared with either H7 or N5, although only differences in LAMP1 and LAMP2 coefficients were statistically significant (FIG. 6D, p<0.01). Reflective of the uniform reduction in co-localization with endosomal and lysosomal markers, the discrete foci of accumulated M16 within the cells did not visually appear to localize strongly with any of the markers tested (FIG. 6A-C).",

FIG. 6A shows SK-BR-3 cells which had been allowed to endocytose scFv dimers (green in merged) were counterstained with an antibody against early endosome antigen type 1 (EEA1, red in merged). As shown in FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C, the same steps were used to counterstain with antibodies against lysosomal associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP1 and LAMP2, red in merged). As indicated by arrowheads, all scFvs co-localized with EEA1, LAMP1 and LAMP2. Scale bar is 5 \u03bcm. As shown in FIG. 6D, co-localization with EEA1, LAMP1, and LAMP2 was quantified by Pearson correlation coefficient (**, p<0.01, *, p<0.05).",
                                "Discussion",
                                "Antibodies with the ability to respond to endosomal pH are intriguing because they offer an additional, tunable, layer of functionality beyond antigen binding affinity. Through semi-rational histidine saturation mutagenesis of parental anti-TfR scFv H7, combined with rapid screening via yeast surface display, it was possible to engineer appreciable increases in dissociation from TfR at pH 5.5, while largely maintaining pH 7.4 antigen binding. In particular, mutant M16 displayed increased overall cellular association primarily resulting from increased intracellular accumulation, and a substantially different intracellular distribution compared to wild-type H7 or the pH-insensitive mutant N5.",
                                "Here, we embraced the idea that pH-sensitivity results from multiple mutations acting in concert [41], especially from multiple histidines in close proximity [39, 42-44]. After screening the histidine-saturated CDRH1 library, we found that the resulting pH-sensitive scFvs contained three or more histidines (out of 10 total residues), centrally located in CDRH1, supporting the beneficial effect of multiple proximal histidines for pH-responsiveness (Table 1). The protonation of the histidine residues at pH 5.5 drives an increased dissociation, also indicating that the CDRH1 loop likely participates in antigen binding as predicted prior to library design [33]. In addition, to achieve the multiplicity of histidine mutations that were key to the outcomes presented above, histidine saturation mutagenesis provides the most efficient approach. Our results were mirrored by an engineered version of the therapeutic IgG adalimumab, where the synergistic effect of paired histidine mutations in CDRs imparted pH-sensitive antigen binding [45]. The context of histidines within the antigen binding site is also an important factor as evidenced by an anti-HER2 Fc-Ab where pH-sensitivity resulted from non-histidine mutations proximal to wild-type histidines [46]. Given the prevalence of three or more histidine mutations in pH-responsive clones, the context-driven effects of such bystander mutations likely played less of a role in our study.",
                                "After binding at pH 7.4, scFv M16 accumulates at significantly higher levels than H7 or its pH-insensitive counterpart N5. As described above, models of anti-TfR immunotoxin delivery have pointed to TfR dissociation as an influential parameter in predicting increased cell-association [24, 25]. The data presented here strongly suggest that pH-dependent TfR dissociation properties of M16 lead to its distinct phenotypic properties. Since assays were performed at scFv concentrations capable of saturating cell surface TfR, the observed differences in internalization phenotype stemmed from differences in intracellular interactions.",
                                "In order to examine whether pH-dependent phenomena were driving the difference in increased scFv M16 internalization, the amount of internalized scFv was monitored after treatment with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of endosomal-lysosomal acidification [41, 42]. In contrast with the untreated, control samples where scFv M16 internalized at levels 2.5-fold greater than wild-type H7 (FIG. 5c, p<0.001), treatment with BafA1 completely removed the beneficial effects of M16 on internalization such that it showed no difference in internalization in comparison to wild-type H7 or scFv N5 (FIG. 5c, p>0.05). These results indicate that endosomal acidification is required to observe the beneficial internalization properties of M16, confirming the important role of pH-sensitive binding.",
                                "Endocytosed M16, H7, and N5 all co-localized with EEA1, LAMP1, and LAMP2 (FIG. 6A-C), frequently cited markers of early-endosomes and late-endosomes/lysosomes, respectively. Quantitative image analysis did not indicate an obvious shift in endosomal versus lysosomal trafficking for M16 (FIG. 6D) compared to H7 or N5. However, an overall reduction in co-localization for all markers was observed. The reduction in M16 co-localization with LAMP1 and LAMP2 correlates with previous findings where reduced anti-TfR affinity, anti-TfR avidity or pH-sensitive TfR binding led to a reduction in lysosomal association [47, 50, and 51]. Also, the reduction in M16 association with endosomal and lysosomal markers occurred in concert with the appearance of large vesicular structures that did not co-localize with any of the markers tested, suggesting a divergence in trafficking. Of interest, when previous studies compared a pH-insensitive anti-TfR antibody (128.1) to a pH-sensitive antibody (MEM-189), 128.1 was found to co-localize with CD63 (late endosomal/lysosomal maker) while MEM-189 instead accumulated in large intracellular structures, reminiscent of those observed with M16, that did not co-localize with CD63 [47]. In the future, more comprehensive trafficking analysis will be needed to definitively pinpoint the intracellular location of scFv M16. In summary, we have created pH-dependent antibodies, e.g., a single chain-antibody, M16, which bind TfR with high affinity at pH7.4, and dissociate from TfR at pH 5.5 thereby markedly increasing intracellular accumulation, and potential therapeutic relevance. It is also anticipated that these antibodies will prove useful in understanding pH-dependent mechanisms underlying TfR-targeted antibody endocytosis and trafficking."
