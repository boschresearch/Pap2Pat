    "title": "A novel inductively coupled capacitor wireless sensor system for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing",
    "date": "2023-08-18",
    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence and severity of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) present a major challenge to our healthcare system. Rapid detection of AMR is essential for lifesaving under emergent conditions such as sepsis. The current gold standard phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) takes more than a day to obtain results. Genotypic ASTs are faster (hours) in detecting the presence of resistance genes but require specific probes/knowledge of each AMR gene and do not provide specific information at the phenotype level. To address this unmet challenge, we developed a new rapid phenotypic AST.We designed a new electrochemical biosensor based on the concept of magnetically coupled LC sensors. The engineered LC sensors can be placed in 96-well plates and communicate the reading remotely with a receiver coil for signal analysis. The sensors were validated by monitoring the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence and absence of different antibiotics. Drug-resistant strains were used as controls. Bacterial growth was detected within 30 min after inoculation, allowing rapid determination of antibiotic susceptibility at the phenotype level. The sensor also functions in the presence of host proteins when tested with 2% FBS in growth media.With the compatibility with 96-well plates, this label-free rapid 30-min AST has the potential for low-cost applications with simple integration into the existing workflow in clinical settings.",

                "Drug-resistant infections present great challenges, especially in hospital settings. About 30% of ICU patients are affected even in high-income countries; and the number is two to three folds higher in low- and mid-income countries [1]. According to a recent WHO report, 2.8 million AMR infections occur each year in the U.S. alone [2]; and at least 1.27 million people died from AMR infection in 2019 worldwide [3]. It is predicted that, by 2050, there could be 10 million deaths per year globally if no effective treatment for AMR is available [4]. Rapid detection of AMR has been proven critical for saving sepsis patients. In an animal study that mimics sepsis, it was revealed that antibiotic treatment administered 12\u00a0h after bacterial inoculation resulted in a 96-h survival rate of 80%, whereas treatment administered at 15\u00a0h had the survival rate sharply decreased to only 13.3% [5]. Thus, rapid ASTs are urgently needed to reduce sepsis mortality and help with antibiotic stewardship programs.",
                "Current methods of pathogen detection by sample cultures have a median growth time of around 13 h [6], which then yields a microbial culture with 107 \u2013 108\u00a0CFU/mL for further analysis of antibiotic susceptibility [7]. Without rapid test of antibiotic susceptibility, the patients are often given general antibiotics [8]. This can cause the precious window to prevent patient mortality to be missed by ineffective treatments due to AMR. Traditional phenotypic methods such as dilution methods, agar disk diffusion testing, and gradient diffusion methods, typically take 1\u20132\u00a0days to generate reliable results [9, 10]. Genotypic ASTs, on the other hand, directly detect biomarkers associated with resistance using molecular detection tools such as qPCR, whole-genome sequencing, and MALDI-TOF. Such tools are highly sensitive and could produce a report in hours [11]. However, genomic approaches require detailed knowledge of AMR gene sequences in advance, and thus cannot detect newly developed resistance mechanisms [9]. There are other new approaches being developed such as optical imaging to identify bacteria and/or track bacterial growth in microfluidic devices [9, 12\u201316], pH sensors for tracking byproducts of bacterial growth [17], bioluminescence assay of ATP [18], magnetic sensors with antibody coating [19], and electrochemical biosensors with peptide or antibody coating [20, 21], etc. These novel approaches provide high sensitivity and specificity, but require extensive image/data processing, complex sample preparation, and/or sophisticated equipment that could be challenging to operate in clinical settings. Additionally, ASTs based on single-cell detection/monitoring have challenges in polymicrobial infections with mixed microbial populations [22]. Thus, we are motivated to develop a rapid high throughput phenotypic AST that is readily scalable, can detect antimicrobial susceptibility at the population level, and can be easily integrated into clinical settings.",
                "Here we report our design based on a new LC sensor. The application of LC sensors in medical devices dates back to 1960s [23]. The magnetic coupling between the sensor coil and the detection coil transmits AC electricity to the sensor circuit where the resonant frequency of the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) can be computed based on the frequency spectrum. The resonant frequency changes in response to the surrounding environment, allowing the detection of substances that change the surface property of the sensor. The wireless nature of the sensor enables sensing in hard-to-access locations either in an instrument or the human body such as wound health sensing [24]. In addition, LC sensor requires no integrated power to operate. Thus, it is possible to make small form factor LC sensors with a long life span. These advantages make LC sensors attractive in designing biomedical devices where the sensors are often sealed and require low to no maintenance to operate in biological environments. However, this technology did not come onto the main stage of remote query systems until the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which enable small-scale LC sensors to be embedded into medical devices and microfluidic devices. Among the applications of this technology [25], a LC resonant sensor for the passive monitoring of bacterial growth in a large volume of agitated medium was developed. But protein adsorption over time was not addressed and the method had a rather\u00a0long detection time of 8\u00a0h. Impedance measurements have also been shown to achieve high sensitivity in microbial detection, e.g., 30\u00a0CFU [26]. However, the current system requires rather complex coating and is not designed for AST. To address the unmet challenges in AST, we developed a new LC sensor based on rational design. It significantly reduces the response time to 30\u00a0min and is functional in the presence of host proteins.",
                "This new rapid phenotypic AST method was developed based on wirelessly magnetically coupled LC sensors, that can exploit the capacitive nature of bacteria [27]. It enables bacterial growth monitoring and antibiotic susceptibility testing without the need for sample enrichment, and species-specific surface modifications or coatings (Fig.\u00a01A). This sensor is expected to be low-cost and requires no special sample handling. It can be integrated into 96-well plates to achieve AST within 30\u00a0min after a positive culture is identified.Fig. 1A Schematic of AST using inductively coupled communication between the LC sensor and detection coil connected to EIS. The diluted bacterial culture with desired antimicrobial added is aliquoted into individual wells on a 96-well plate. The sensor wrapped around the internal walls of the well plate communicates wirelessly with an EIS\u00a0analyzer to capture bacterial growth.

The high resistance introduced by low salt LB provides a lower background level making the resonant frequency shift in the system more detectable. Baseline readout of the sterile medium was established and subsequently subtracted as background from the experimental data below. Initial growth monitoring was tested with E. coli MG1655 (Fig.\u00a04A). Data revealed that compared to the lag phase observed in the growth curve based on OD600, relative permittivity was more sensitive in detecting bacterial growth. Upon inoculation, there was an immediate increase in permittivity, likely due to nonspecific adsorption of proteins in the growth medium onto the polyurethane coating. Similar phenomena were observed when measuring the baseline, where there was an initial moderate increase in signal for the sterile medium alone. Further increase due to specific bacterial growth (after subtracting the signal from the sterile medium) was recorded within 30\u00a0min after inoculation, much earlier than OD600 measurement (around 5\u00a0h). The growth curve collected by the system showed a rapid\u00a0increase in relative permittivity which then slowed down over time and eventually reached a plateau. The presence of a plateau is presumably due to the saturation of free space on the sensor surface by bacterial growth and associated byproducts. Further experiments were done on two more different strains of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to test if the functionality of the sensor extends beyond just E. coli. As shown in Fig.\u00a04A, not only do all three strains elicit similar responses over the 3.5\u00a0h monitoring period, the three strains showed some segments of different patterns of growth, which can be investigated in future research for potential strain identification using specific media.Fig. 4Monitoring bacterial growth using the new sensor system.

It can be seen in Fig.\u00a06 that the dose dependence of bacterial susceptibility to an\u00a0antibiotic can be seen in both LC sensor system and OD600 measurement, where trends of growth inhibition after 6\u201310\u00a0h in OD600 measurement were captured by the slope of permittivity measurement substantially earlier in just 30\u00a0min.Fig. 6AST results based on the slopes of permittivity curves (A, D, G) and growth curves based on OD600 (B, C, E, F, H, I).

                        "To further validate this assay, a microdilution MIC test was performed with the same bacterial strains and antibiotics included in this study, while more concentrations were included in this microdilution test to determine the exact MIC. Based on the microdilution test, the MICs were found as follows: E. coli MG1655 (ampicillin: 12.8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL; ofloxacin: 0.016\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), S. aureus (vancomycin: 0.2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL; ampicillin: 0.8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ciprofloxacin: 0.256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL; tobramycin: 51.2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). These results are consistent with the senor data in Fig.\u00a06."

                        "Samples collected in a clinical setting are often complex. Whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, or other liquid from the human body contains significantly more types and larger amounts of proteins and cells compared to laboratory culture media. Thus, it is necessary to test the sensor system with the addition of complex components in order to evaluate the feasibility of implementing this system in a clinical setting where sample preparation beyond dilution and centrifugation is seldom performed. For the above reasons, fetal bovine serum was selected to mimic host serum and added to low salt LB at different percentages. The response of the sensor system is shown in Fig.\u00a07. Encouragingly, at lower concentrations, the sensor functioned well for sensing bacterial growth suggesting that there is sufficient free space near the sensor surface. For low salt LB dosed with 2% of FBS, the growth of E. coli wild-type strain MG1655 was captured by the LC sensor system with little interference from the serum. This demonstrates the possibility of using these sensors in clinical settings with simple dilution. When the amount of FBS reached 5%, the response was lost, likely because the free space thickness was saturated by protein adsorption. Based on these results, we expect that the system will function with clinical samples because the seeding cells are from cultured samples with host proteins significantly diluted. Additional testing with clinical samples is needed to further validate this system and it is part of our further work.Fig. 7Slopes of permittivity curves of E. coli MG1655 cultured in low salt LB supplemented with different concentrations of FBS",
                        "The coating material and coating thickness of the chips can also be optimized to achieve higher accuracy and resistance to fouling from the growth media or cellular products. A better optimized coating could also further decrease detection limit and broaden detection range. The results of 2% FBS demonstrate the possibility to test clinical samples after simple dilution. To handle even higher amounts of serum if needed, the IDE design could be adjusted to increase the saturation thickness the upper concentration limit of FBS content. The saturation thickness can be described by Eqs. 8, 9 and 10,\u00a0where a1 and a2 are both functions of digit width W and gap width D [34].\\[d_{\\mathit{sat}} = - \\frac{D}{a_{1}}\\ln\\left( \\frac{0.005}{a_{2}} \\right)\\] \\[a_{1} = 114.97{(W + D)}^{3} + 28.75{(W + D)}^{2} - 9.183\\left( {W, + ,D} \\right) + 1.631\\] \\[a_{2} = 1293.21{(W + D)}^{3} + 164.87{(W + D)}^{2} - 6.521\\left( {W, + ,D} \\right) + 6.105\\]",
                        "With thicker free space for sensing, the system can be further optimized to capture more complex samples and longer-term growth patterns. As a part of our future work, the sensor would also be challenged with actual clinical samples to further test the tolerance of the sensor surface to fouling\u00a0and set the thresholds of slopes for AMR detection."

                "This study demonstrated the feasibility of rapid AST using LC sensor that is compatible with 96 well plate setting. To our best knowledge, this is the fastest AST test at the phenotypic level to date without using complex equipment. Compared to genotypic ASTs, this system only requires simple sample preparation (dilution only) and can be fitted into an automated workflow for high-throughput detection. The system can generate reports with little computational power without the need for advanced data analysis or the capability of handling massive data sets (e.g., MALDI-TOF). The system is also not limited to the use of specific cartridges for a limited selection of strains. Instead, it resembles the traditional MIC approach where prior knowledge regarding the identity of the species is not required rather the growth inhibition at different dosages alone could determine the antibiotic susceptibility, including polymicrobial infections. But it has a much faster readout (in 30\u00a0min). The system can be further optimized in the future by employing high-throughput apparatus to move the plate and scan the wells. This will enable the whole plate to be processed in a relatively short amount of time, and is part of our ongoing work."
