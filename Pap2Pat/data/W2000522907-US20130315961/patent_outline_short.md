# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- discuss bone generation and maintenance

## SUMMARY

- introduce monocyte-derived bone-forming cells

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce monoosteophils and methods of generating them
- motivate monocyte differentiation into bone-forming cells
- describe LL-37-induced monocyte differentiation into monoosteophils
- distinguish monoosteophils from other bone-forming cells and monocyte-derived cells
- discuss applications of monoosteophils in bone repair and reconstruction
- describe bone graft composition
- motivate therapeutic use of monoosteophils
- describe therapeutic composition for bone injury or disease
- explain delivery of gene product using monoosteophils
- discuss biocompatible carrier or matrix material
- outline additional therapeutic compounds for bone formation
- summarize treatment options for bone injuries and diseases

### Generation of LL-37-Differentiated Bone-Forming Cells (Monoosteophils)

- describe materials and methods
- detail monocyte preparation and differentiation
- analyze LL-37-induced monocyte differentiation and survival

### Monoosteophils Induce In Vitro and In Vivo Bone Formation

- describe additional materials and methods

- examine in vivo bone formation ability of monoosteophils

### Monoosteophils are Distinct from Other Related Cell Types

- list reagents
- describe monocyte preparation and differentiation
- detail microscopic observation of differentiated monocytes
- describe phagocytosis and cytokine multiplex analysis
- compare monoosteophils to monocyte-derived osteoclasts and mesenchymal stem cells
- distinguish monoosteophils from in vitro differentiated macrophages and dendritic cells
