# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- introduce stereotactic body radiation therapy

## BACKGROUND

- limitations of current CBCT systems

## SUMMARY

- motivate motion compensated 4D-CBCT image reconstruction
- describe reconstruction method based on bilateral filtering
- outline steps of reconstruction method
- highlight benefits of present disclosure

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce 4D-CBCT image reconstruction method
- describe initial 4D-CBCT image reconstruction and initial 4D-DVF generation
- detail iterative 4D-DVF optimization using bilateral filtering
- outline final high-quality 4D-CBCT image generation

### EXAMPLE 1

- verify algorithm on 4D NCAT phantom
- compare reconstruction results with and without bilateral filtering
- evaluate motion errors caused by sliding motion
- present quantitative analysis of reconstruction errors
