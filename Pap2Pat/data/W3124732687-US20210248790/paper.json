    "title": "Fully Automatic Sliding Motion Compensated and Simultaneous 4D-CBCT via Bilateral Filtering",
    "date": "2021-01-18",
    "abstract": "To incorporate the bilateral filtering into the Deformable Vector Field (DVF) based 4D-CBCT reconstruction for realizing a fully automatic sliding motion compensated 4D-CBCT.Initially, a motion compensated simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (mSART) is used to generate a high quality reference phase (e.g. 0% phase) by using all phase projections together with the initial 4D-DVFs. The initial 4D-DVF were generated via Demons registration between 0% phase and each other phase image. The 4D-DVF will then kept updating by matching the forward projection of the deformed high quality 0% phase with the measured projection of the target phase. The loss function during this optimization contains an projection intensity difference matching criterion plus a DVF smoothing constrain term. We introduce a bilateral filtering kernel into the DVF constrain term to estimate the sliding motion automatically. The bilateral filtering kernel contains three sub-kernels: 1) an spatial domain Guassian kernel; 2) an image intensity domain Guassian kernel; and 3) a DVF domain Guassian kernel. By choosing suitable kernel variances, the sliding motion can be extracted. A non-linear conjugate gradient optimizer was used. We validated the algorithm on a non-uniform rotational B-spline based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom and four anonymous patient data. For quantification, we used: 1) the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) together with the Maximum-Error (MaxE); 2) the Dice coefficient of the extracted lung contour from the final reconstructed images and 3) the relative reconstruction error (RE) to evaluate the algorithm's performance.For NCAT phantom, the motion trajectory's RMSE/MaxE are 0.796/1.02 mm for bilateral filtering reconstruction; and 2.704/4.08 mm for original reconstruction. For patient pilot study, the 4D-Dice coefficient obtained with bilateral filtering are consistently higher than that without bilateral filtering. Meantime several image content such as the rib position, the heart edge definition, the fibrous structures all has been better corrected with bilateral filtering.We developed a bilateral filtering based fully automatic sliding motion compensated 4D-CBCT scheme. Both digital phantom and initial patient pilot studies confirmed the improved motion estimation and image reconstruction ability. It can be used as a 4D-CBCT image guidance tool for lung SBRT treatment.",

                "In image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), 3D Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is extensively applied to check patient positioning before a radiation beam is delivered. However 3D-CBCT is not capable to capture a dynamic moving target and reflect the respiration motion during radiation therapy. Nowadays SBRT (Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy) has been applied widely for lung cancer treatment due to its better treatment effect compared with conventional IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy). At the SBRT treatment stage for lung cancer cases, the patient usually will be performed with a 3D-CBCT to check positioning before SBRT beam on. However in this process, the physician cannot check again if the patient respiration matches with that of the 4D-CT, especially for the GTV region. To compensate for the deficiency, 4D-CBCT was proposed for accurate on board motion tracking. There are different categories of existed 4D-CBCT reconstruction schemes. The first category is employed to increase the acquired projection number under each gantry angle by performing multiple gantry rotation or reducing the gantry rotation speed (1, 2). But it prolongs the imaging time and increases the imaging dose. The second 4D-CBCT category is the non-local mean/Total Variation (TV)-based algorithms (3\u20135). The TV method supplies a qualified noise suppressed image but it over-smoothed tiny structures and further deteriorate the image quality of the low contrast region. The third category is the full data initialization-based reconstruction such as the McKinnon-Bates (MKB) algorithm (6, 7) and the prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS)-based algorithm (7, 8). However, the residual motion will transmit artifacts from the initial reconstruction to the final images. And the fourth category is the low-rank models (9) and the framelet (5, 10) based reconstruction. However, the low rank method cannot fully realize the time differentiation, and both of these two methods are lack of clinical supporting results feasibility check. In recent years, the Deformable Vector Field (DVF)-based 4D-CBCT image reconstruction algorithm has shown an advantage for high-quality 4D-CBCT reconstruction (11\u201314). However, most of those methods assume the lung moves along an uniform path and ignored the lung's non-average local motion (e.g. sliding motion). This assumption is not true since sliding motion exists widely at the interfaces between moving organs such as the lung and the chest wall's interface. A few studies have tried to model the sliding motion via lung boundary segmentation (12). But its clinical translation is hindered due to its ineluctable requirement of lung boundary half automatic segmentation.",
                "In this study, we develop a fully automatic sliding motion compensated 4D-CBCT reconstruction algorithm in a fundamentally different way by using bilateral filtering. This algorithm performs bilateral filtering on the DVF during the motion optimization process. Bilateral filtering has been previously utilized for estimating sliding motion for 4D-CT (15). But here we adapt this technique to 4D-CBCT, which is a more challenging scenario. Accurate 4D-DVF estimation from 4D-CBCT imaging geometry, especially for sliding motion extraction, is more difficult than that of 4D-CT. This is not only because the acquired CBCT projections are contaminated with serious scatters but also because the available projection number per phase are quite limited due to conventional 1 min clinical scanning protocol. We estimate the 4D-DVF by matching the measured projection of each target phase with the deformed phase 0%'s Digital Reconstructed Radiography (DRR). Meantime we incorporate bilateral filtering into the 4D-DVF estimation process for sliding motion modeling. A non-linear conjugate gradient optimizer is used for this optimization process.",
                "Our results indicate that the bilateral filtering-based motion modeling and reconstruction is capable of better sliding motion modeling. For algorithm validation, we applied a non-uniform rotational B-spline that is based on a cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom. Subsequently, four patient data with IRB approval were used to perform an initial pilot clinical validation."

There are two steps in the algorithm: 1) reconstruct a high quality phase 0% image using all acquired projections with motion compensated SART (Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique, mSART). The motion compensated SART is mathematically described in equation (1). Then step 2): estimate the 4D-DVF by matching each phase's measured projection with the DRR (Digitally Reconstructed Radiography) of the deformed phase 0%. These two steps are performed in an interleaved fashion to allow a converged energy function curve. The loss function was designed into a symmetrical form to ensure an inverse consistent DVF solution, see equation (2). Once the 4D-DVF optimized solution were obtained it will be used to deform the final iterative reconstructed high quality phase 0% image to get the final high quality 4D-CBCT[see equation (6)].

Using an IRB approved protocol (MD Anderson with IRB# 00-202), the patients were scanned in full fan mode for 4\u20136 min to acquire approximately 2000 projections. The acquired projections were then sorted by phase binning into 10 phases. In this manner, the number of average projections per phase was approximately 200, and TV minimization reconstruction was applied to reconstruct the high-quality 4D-CBCT that can serve as the patient reference for clinical results quantification. To simulate an approximate 1-min CBCT data we down-sampled the acquired 4D full projections until the average projection number per phase decreased to ~40. We performed the original simultaneous reconstruction and the bilateral filtering-based sliding constrained reconstruction for quantitative comparisons with the ground truth. Here we need to clarify that although the down-sampling helps to mimic a 1-min CBCT, one still cannot getting a real 1-min CBCT data. Even with the same number of projection per phase, 6-min CBCT scan is still better than 1-min case because the projections are further spread out in 6-min case. Down-sampling only helps to mimic an approximate 1-min CBCT case for algorithm testing."

Excessively large or small \u03c3x (spatial smoothness) will either over-smooth the image content or prevent it from sufficiently capturing the local sparse features. The voxel size is 1 mm3 for the NCAT phantom data and 2 mm3 for the patient data. Hence the reasonable spatial variance \u03c3x should not be smaller than 2 mm. With several round testing, we determined \u03c3x = 3 mm gives the best results for the reconstructed images both for the NCAT phantom and the patient data. The image will be over-smoothed if \u03c3x is larger than 3 mm. \u03c3\u03bc controls the image intensity domain smoothness between the interface of the lung part and the chest wall. We set it equal to the difference between the lung tissue and the surrounding chest cavity tissue to retain the nature intensity transit from the chest cavity boundary to the lung inner part. For the NCAT phantom data, \u03c3\u03bc = 0.03 mm-1 gives the best results, and for the patient pilot data, \u03c3\u03bc = 0.02 mm-1 gives the best results. The most difficult part is to determine \u03c3v for extracting the sliding motion. Theoretically, \u03c3v should be larger than the DVF difference between two points at a distance smaller than \u03c3x. However at the pleural cavity region \u03c3v should be smaller than the DVF intensity difference (15) between the two points. To avoid motion over-segmentation, we set that only sharp discontinuities (e.g., large sliding motion) can be captured. In our former work (12), we compared the results obtained from the original simultaneous reconstruction method and the ground truth and discovered that the sliding motion estimation error at the heart edge site is approximately 7.5 mm. Hence, we suggest that 10 mm is a relatively large amount of sliding motion. With this assumption, we tested several \u03c3v values and determined that \u03c3v = 2.5 mm gives reasonable results for NCAT data.",

We discovered that the rib position has a maximum motion error of approximately 5~6 mm at the pleural cavity site. Hence, we suggest that 6 mm is a relatively large sliding motion amount. With this assumption, we establish 2 mm of \u03c3v for the patient pilot test and obtain the desired results."

Figure 3 shows the 4D motion trajectory extracted from the original reconstruction without sliding motion modeling, the segmentation based sliding motion modeling, the bilateral filtering based sliding motion modeling, and the motion ground truth. The figure indicates that the trajectory extracted both with bilateral filtering and segmentation-based sliding motion modeling matches better with the ground truth. We consider each of the trajectory's motion amplitude for the RMSE calculation and determine that the trajectory's RMSE and MaxE are 0.796 mm and 1.02 mm for the bilateral filtering-based results. Meantime the segmentation based RMSE/MaxE are quite close to that of the bilateral filtering based results. The original reconstruction result\u2019s RMSE and MaxE are 2.704 mm and 4.08 mm, respectively."

                        "We discovered an over-smoothing side effect for the fibrous texture in Figure 6, which is labeled by the yellow arrow. We made a \u03c3v sensitivity analysis to check whether this effect is caused by the DVF domain's filter kernel. We set \u03c3v to 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm to perform the 4D-CBCT reconstruction. We also removed the DVF domain sub-kernel (e.g., to set the DVF domain kernel to 1) from the entire bilateral filtering kernel to perform the reconstruction and eliminate the influence of \u03c3v. The corresponding reconstructed slices of the target phases are shown in Figure 10. The results indicate that regardless of how \u03c3v changes, the arrow-labeled fibrous structure is always over-smoothed. Hence, this over-smoothing effect is not directly caused by the DVF domain sub-filter kernel. This indicates that the over-smoothing can be caused by the conventional bilateral filter's texture smoothing feature. The bilateral filtering kernel that we employed is a 3D kernel in a cubic 3x3x3 voxel region. We checked the smoothed texture's adjacent slice region and found that the adjacent local region contains dense tiny fibrous textures (refer to Figure 10H). The 3D bilateral filter smoothed the texture not only in the adjacent slice (Figure 10I) but also spread it to the current slice (Figures 10A\u2013D). This over-smoothing effect occurred where the tiny fibrous textures are located very close to each other. If we want to remove this excessive smoothing effect, one possible solution is to rely on more projections within this phase. More projections will supply additional information for better reconstruction. We can also increase the image resolution by using a smaller voxel size for reconstruction."

The relative reconstruction error of the bilateral filtering reconstruction is 7.3% and 7.4% for the segmentation based reconstruction. However, differences in some image slices remain. In Figure 2 we already show that the rib can be better reconstructed with bilateral filtering reconstruction than that of segmentation result. Figure 11 also shows the coronal views obtained from bilateral filtering-based construction, segmentation-based reconstruction, and original simultaneous reconstructions. Both of these two algorithms have corrected the rib positions to match with the ground truth (rib #1 and #2's top edges). The vein length (represented by the yellow circles) has also been corrected by these two algorithms compared with the ground truth. The vein has even been reconstructed more clearly by the bilateral filtering reconstruction. The bilateral filtering-based scheme obtained better reconstruction results compared with the segmentation based reconstruction."

As the sliding motion mainly occurs at the interface between the lung and the chest wall, we only focus on this zoomed local region of interest to determine the DVF differences. Figure 12 shows the lung-chest wall ROI. Figure 12A is the ROI from the bilateral filtering-based result; Figure 12B is the corresponding ROI from the original reconstruction. The red dotted line gives the DVF flow trend. The bilateral filtering-based DVF flow (refer to red line in Figure 12A) drops downward from the rib side to the lung part. For the original case, the DVF flow slides straight from the rib side to the lung side. This DVF flow difference directly causes the rib position differences in the final reconstructed images. Hence, this finding reveals that bilateral filtering effectively corrected the rib position compared with the original reconstruction."

                        "DVF optimization iteration is 18 s for the presented algorithm to reconstruct an image with size of 200 x 200 x 150. Currently, DVFs for each phase were estimated sequentially and we partially implemented the algorithm on a GPU card (Geforce GTX 980, NVIDA, Santa Clara, CA). Only the forward projection for each view was parallel accelerated on GPU. To further speed up the calculation, possible strategy includes: 1) full GPU implementation and 2) running DVF estimation for different phases in a parallel fashion on multiple GPU cards. Recently a deep leaning based 4D-CBCT motion estimation algorithm (19, 20), was developed. In this paper a CNN model is constructed to predict a PCA (Principle Component Analysis) based DVF motion modeling. The PCA eigenvectors and the corresponding PCA coefficients are predicted to obtain the real time updated 4D-DVF. The training dataset is a pre-built projection based datasets with more than 1 \u00d7 106 simulated projections from the patient 4D-CT. Their reported calculation time cost is around 30~40 min for network training with a Intel Core i7-5960X CPU, 32 GB memory and NIVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The advantage of this algorithm is that it realized real-time motion tracking. But one disadvantage is that the training data (e.g. the simulated projections that contains respiration motion) comes from 4D-CT but not the on board 4D-CBCT. Hence once the patient respiration mode changes between the 4D-CT scanning stage and the 4D-CBCT scanning stage the predicted real time 4D-CBCT will not reflect the true respiration at the treatment stage. As the 4D-DVF estimation principle of this algorithm is fundamentally different compared with our method. So it is not fair to make a parallel comparison between our results and their algorithms. Obviously deep learning based real-time 4D-CBCT is very promising for supplying quality 4D-CBCT. Once the patient on-board respiration projection dataset were built, the deep learning network will possibly be able to predict accurate on-board 4D-CBCT. This will be our next step research focus."
