    "date": "2021-07-19",
    "abstract": "We propose displaced signed distance fields, an implicit shape representation to accurately, efficiently and robustly 3D-print finely detailed and smoothly curved surfaces at native device resolution. As the resolution and accuracy of 3D printers increase, accurate reproduction of such surfaces becomes increasingly realizable from a hardware perspective. However, representing such surfaces with polygonal meshes requires high polygon counts, resulting in excessive storage, transmission and processing costs. These costs increase with print size, and can become exorbitant for large prints. Our implicit formulation simultaneously allows the augmentation of low-polygon meshes with compact meso-scale topographic information, such as displacement maps, and the realization of curved polygons, while leveraging efficient, streaming-compatible, discrete voxel-wise algorithms. Critical for this is careful treatment of the input primitives, their voxel approximation and the displacement to the true surface. We further propose a robust sign estimation to allow for incomplete, non-manifold input, whether human-made for onscreen rendering or directly out of a scanning pipeline. Our framework is efficient both in terms of time and space. The running time is independent of the number of input polygons, the amount of displacement, and is constant per voxel. The storage costs grow sub-linearly with the number of voxels, making our approach suitable for large prints. We evaluate our approach for efficiency and robustness, and show its advantages over standard techniques.",

                "This paper presents a unified framework for 3D printing highly detailed and smooth surfaces from compact representations by robustly and efficiently computing displaced signed distance fields, which represent the shape implicitly as the composition of a discrete signed distance field and a displacement field. The displacement field encodes the offset from a discrete voxel approximation to the true surface. We show how this formulation allows the use of efficient, streaming algorithms operating on discrete voxel grids while maintaining sub-voxel accuracy, and show how to use this framework to 3D print coarse tessellations with displacement maps encoding mesoscopic detail, curved surfaces, and incomplete or self-overlapping surfaces.",
                "As the resolution and accuracy of 3D printers increase, accurate reproduction of finely detailed and smoothly curved surfaces becomes increasingly realizable from a hardware perspective. Representing surfaces with polygonal meshes to an accuracy on the order of modern 3D printers requires a large number of polygons, correspondingly increasing requirements for storage and bandwidth for transmission. Further, the same approximation accuracy requires different levels of tessellation for different print sizes.",
                "With increasing use of graphical 3D printing in the entertainment sector, for films or 3D printing content from game engines, automated and efficient processing of graphical 3D content from these applications becomes increasingly important. Such models often reduce polygon counts by encoding mesoscopic geometric detail in displacement maps, topographic textures or height maps applied to a low-poly mesh. Thus, it is advantageous to directly support this type of input (Fig. 1, center) without computationally demanding tessellation, which can introduce further errors in the form of self-intersections and inverted surfaces. Since they are designed for on-screen display, not physical fabrication, such models are often composed of open, overlapping surfaces and decals. The mesh in Fig. 1 (center) is comprised of disjoint patches with small gaps in between. Thus, robust processing is key to automation.",
                "Over half of parts produced by additive manufacturing are either functional parts or functional prototypes [Wohlers et al. 2020]. These are often designed and represented by parametric patches, rather than polygonal meshes. The typical workflow still involves tessellating these surfaces into polygonal meshes, which in general introduces a discretization error. Tessellation into meshes of curved triangles is an alternative, which scales much better in terms of making the approximation error significantly less sensitive to the scale of the printed part. Existing approaches to fabrication with curved triangles are based on subdivision, again requiring different amounts of subdivision for different print sizes. This paper shows how displaced signed distance fields can realize curved trianglebased shapes to printer resolution without tessellation (Fig. 1, right).",
                "Making a 3D copy of a real object involves scanning that object, the output of which often comes in the form of a point cloud, and typically there are portions of the surface which cannot be scanned, resulting in an incomplete surface (Fig. 1,left). Directly processing such data for 3D printing can also streamline workflows.",
                "For applications in graphical 3D printing, including rapid prototyping and entertainment, the build volumes and resolutions of modern devices mean any method needs to scale up to nearly 10 12 voxels [Mimaki 2017;Stratasys 2016]. This constrains us to algorithms that have complexity linear in the number of voxels, or constant time per voxel. More restrictively, it constrains us to so-called streaming compatible algorithms, which require a peak storage less than 1 byte per voxel for large prints. We define such algorithms formally in Section 3.",
                "In this paper, our primary technical contribution is a unified implicit formulation and resulting algorithmic framework to robustly and efficiently",
                "\u2022 produce highly detailed surfaces from low-polygon meshes with an attached displacement map, \u2022 produce smooth surfaces from low-polygon meshes of higher order primitives.",
                "We further propose a technique for representing surface structures with local feature size on the order of, and even below, the voxel size. Our formulation gives rise to algorithms with the following advantages:",

                "In particular, if we consider as an alternative computing the true signed distance field (SDF), we would encounter the following problems. In the case of displacement maps or curved higher-order primitives, we would need to first tessellate to a desired tolerance (thus introducing some error anyways), along with the associated problems of potential self-intersection. Doing this on-the-fly within a streaming context would require bounded displacements. To compute the exact distance field w.r.t. the tessellation would need a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) or similar space partitioning, resulting in running time logarithmic in the number of primitives, which would be large in the case of refined tessellation. Our displaced SDF provide an good approximation of the true SDF, and allows more efficient and robust processing."

This technique is limited to a small voxel grid as it requires the full voxel grid in memory simultaneously.",
                "The generalized winding number [Jacobson et al. 2013] provides a way to robustly determine whether a point lies inside or outside a curve of surface by extending the winding number to open curves and surfaces. This inherits the winding number's natural handling of self-overlapping surfaces, behaves smoothly in holes, and degrades gracefully in the presence of noise or inconsisten surface orientation. Barill et al. [2018] provided a fast approximate evaluation for triangle soups and point clouds based on a multipole expansion, and showed some robust voxelization examples. Schmidt [2019] describes converting an unsigned distance field into a SDF using a flood fill approach, starting at one or more voxels known to be outside the surface and stopping at inversions of the gradient. It is not clear that this technique can work for large holes, or is practical for large voxel grids. Another technique [Stevens and McKenna 2018] computes a SDF of a polygon mesh by generating multiple layered depth images [Shade et al. 1998], and using them to resolve tessellation inconsistencies to compute signed distances. Krayer and M\u00fcller [2019] propose a GPU-based approach based on ray-maps, which is both fast and robust, but does not appear to scale well to large voxel grids."

                        "There are many existing methods for surface repair, both those specifically targeting 3D printing and those targeting more general application areas. Most of these operate directly on a mesh. Such methods benefit from local operations and are therefore quite efficient. Difficulties arise in simultaneously handling holes, nonmanifold edges and vertices, islands (disconnected pieces), and selfintersection. Most methods to convert arbitrary collections of polygons into surfaces do not robustly handle self-intersection [Gu\u00e9ziec et al. 2001;Hoppe et al. 1993;Kraevoy et al. 2003;Podolak and Rusinkiewicz 2005] in that they do not guarantee a watertight output. Methods that do offer guarantees typically fall into two categories: those that globally remesh the surface [Bischoff et al. 2005;Ju 2004] and those that remove parts of the mesh that are difficult to handle, either creating holes and refilling them [Attene 2010] or specifically removing parts causing self-intersections [Yamakawa and Shimada 2009]. In our application, global remeshing would be acceptable, and our surface voxelization stage can be seen as an approximate resampling of the surface. However, we are interested in obtaining an implicit representation, which we can combine with mesoscopic detail information."

We discuss the most closely related methods here.",

For efficiency, they discretize using an octree to obtain a sparse linear system and to simultaneously avoid computations away from the surface. Implicit moving least squares [Kolluri 2005], its variant based on robust estimation [Oeztireli et al. 2008], and others, follow the gradient of an implicit function to the surface. These techniques reduce computational effort by evaluating only in the vicinity of the surface. To apply displacement, we need to consider possibly large distances from the surface, and for this reason we must compute a signed distance, and therefore a sign, at all voxels in our bounding volume. Given this restriction, sophisticated regularization, such as solving a PDE, is too costly."

Sign agnostic learning [Atzmon and Lipman 2020] provides indifference to errors in surface orientation, at the cost of limited detail preservation and robustness to thin structures. Including an Eikonal constraint in the loss improves reconstruction of sharp features and thin structures [Atzmon and Lipman 2021;Gropp et al. 2020]. Davies et al. [2021] propose to use an overfit neural network as a compact implicit shape representation. Sitzmann et al. [2020] also showed implicit shape encoding as an application. While this line of work present exciting results, these methods are too computationally intensive for our application. Even approaches using offline training [Erler et al. 2020] require a forward pass per signed distance evaluation, and shape representation/reconstruction approaches require training per object."

For bounded displacements, by paying close attention to the order in which facets are processed, such a tessellation approach can be done on-the-fly within a streaming framework, and efficient GPU implementations exist. In contrast, our approach can apply unbounded displacements within a streaming computation, without affecting performance, while replacing the geometric operations of tessellation with sampling and writing of displacement values. We show the performance of our framework under displacements of various magnitudes in Section 8.2.",

Commercial 3D printing software also displaces the vertices of a densely tessellated mesh [Stratasys 2020]. This leads to high polygon counts and can introduce self-intersections and inverted surfaces, particularly for larger displacements, as shown in Section 8.2. Our approach does not suffer from these problems. While one could leverage techniques from geographic information systems to convert digital elevation maps to meshes [Garland and Heckbert 1995], this would only provide a trade-off between approximation quality and compactness, and would not address self-intersections."

Their technique involves pre-computing a sparse surface voxelization, also constructed in \ud835\udc42 (1) per voxel with limited memory, stored in ascending order of \ud835\udc67 for each \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66-column. This allows the unsigned distance to the surface voxels to be computed in constant time per voxel when processing slices in order, storing as little as a single slice in memory at once. Similar data structures have also been used for slice thickness optimization [Alexa et al. 2017] and morphological operations [Martinez et al. 2015]. While we use this technique to compute unsigned distances and to identify the nearest surface voxel to a given voxel, it does not address sign estimation, sub-voxel accuracy or displacement. We further reduce the memory footprint during construction by using a hash map on the voxel coordinates, rather than storing dense slices. Our implicit formulation, given in Section 3, makes possible the use of such fast, streaming, voxel-wise techniques for robust and precise fabrication."

                        "In this section, we evaluate the robustness of our approach to corrupted data. We show some visual results for real-world data in Figs. 1a, 9 and 10. Fig. 1a shows an open surface as a result of a scan, which our method is able to voxelize for printing. To obtain a near-constant thickness, we set a minimum level set value, -0.8 cm, and extract a surface at that iso-level in addition to the 0-level. Fig. 9 shows the result of printing a multi-view stereo reconstruction [Waechter et al. 2014] of a statue of Copernicus. Due to the many occluding surfaces, the scan has many holes, small and large with complex boundaries, and some floating triangles. The bottom of the model is completely open, since it is the ground surrounding the statue. Our approach preserves the detail of the textured surfaces and completes the model without introducing extraneous surface features. Fig. 10 shows a point cloud [Rodrigues et al. 2014] and the 3D printed result. The model includes colors and normals at each point. Again, the model is completely open on one side, and to print with a near-constant thickness, we use a second iso-level of -0.8 cm.    11 shows the Hausdorff distance for different numbers of holes, for an average hole radius of 0.02 (left), and for different hole sizes for a 100 holes. We see that the error increases gradually as the number of holes increase, but that the variance also increases. A similar behavior can be observed for increasing hole size. Additional results can be found in Appendix E. All lengths (radii, Hausdorff distance) are given as a fraction of the model's bounding box diagonal. "

                        "In this section, we compare the displacement mapping performance of our approach to that of vertex displacement, which was performed using Blender [2020]. A displacement map can be applied to a model in Blender using the Subdivision Surface and Displace modifiers to subdivide the surface and displace the vertices, respectively. We compare this method to ours in terms of geometric compactness, and processing efficiency. We also verify that with increasing subdivision, vertex displacement converges toward our displaced result. We use a test set of four models with displacement maps, shown in Fig. 14 and in Appendix D. Right: Setup time, including reading from disk, parsing, and placing the model in the printer's build space, with increasing surface subdivisions for different models. The 0-level subdivision refers to the original tessellation with a displacement map applied to using our method. Fig. 12 (left) shows the exponential increase in the number of triangles for increasing subdivision levels. Fig. S6 in Supplemental Appendix D shows the corresponding exponential increase in file size. In Fig. 12 (right), we compare the time required to load and parse the input mesh, and position it in the printer's build space for different subdivision levels, where level 0 indicates the original mesh with displacement map. For higher subdivision levels the time is dominated by file parsing. This is clearly dependent on the file format; we used the OBJ format, since it supports displacement maps, and is more widely supported by 3D printing software than other formats. Fig. 17a shows the processing time of our method for different levels of subdivisions. Again, 0 indicates the original mesh with displacement map. We see that the processing time for a fixed number of voxels does not change significantly (note the compressed range on the vertical axis). We choose this measure since the different subdivision levels result in different numbers of voxels to process (the object becomes bigger).",
                        "To compare the level of detail obtained using vertex displacement vs. our method, we look at the Hausdorff distance \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b between our method and the different levels of subdivision. Fig. 13a shows both \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b and the one-sided variant \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b * (\ud835\udc37,\ud835\udc47 ), measuring the distance of \ud835\udc37 to \ud835\udc47 , such that \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udc37,\ud835\udc47 ) = max(\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b * (\ud835\udc37,\ud835\udc47 ), \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b * (\ud835\udc47 , \ud835\udc37)), where \ud835\udc37 denotes the surface generated using the original tessellation with displacement map, and \ud835\udc47 denotes the surface generated by subdivision. We can see that in general both decrease as the tessellated versions are refined. Self-intersections created by vertex displacement result in inside-out surfaces in some locations, which causes \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b to increase for higher subdivision levels. However, \ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc3b * continues to decrease showing that with higher subdivision, the vertex displaced models approach the shape of applying displacement using our method.",

Allowing the displacement signal to have a fixed scale would allow the mesoscopic information to maintain its frequency as the object changes in size. Including support for other types of curved triangles, e.g. Lagrange simplices, would simplify interfacing 3D printing with FEM analysis."
