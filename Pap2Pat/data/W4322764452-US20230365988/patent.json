                                "Inflammation is a defense mechanism induced by infection or body damage, etc., and is a complex biological response that is involved by various cells and regulated by multiple cytokines and signal transduction pathways. It is known that the product of the inflammatory response induces damage to surrounding tissues, and that the damage of these tissues is associated with the development of various diseases.",
                                "Recently, the incidence of diseases accompanied by chronic inflammation has increased not only in Korea but also around the world, and in most cases, the above diseases are treated by methods of suppressing inflammation. However, the mechanism by which inflammation is induced varies depending on the characteristics and etiology of organs and tissues in which each disease develops, and the degree to which the drug reaches varies, so the strategy of controlling inflammation should be considered differently for each disease.",
                                "Drugs to treat inflammation are largely divided into steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs/NAIDs).",
                                "Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs act on glucocorticoid receptors to suppress the inflammation-related gene expression, thereby exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects. Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have stronger effects than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but have strong side effects, so long-term administration is difficult.",
                                "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit COX (cyclooxygenase), which synthesizes prostaglandin, a mediator of inflammation, and exhibit antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, and are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world, but have side effects such as blood coagulation disorders, bleeding, gastrointestinal disorders, or ulcers.",
                                "Accordingly, anti-cytokine drugs that inhibit the action of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), IL-1 (interleukin-1) or IL-6 (interleukin-6) have recently been developed and used. However, since these are antibody-based protein drugs, they have disadvantages such as being impossible to administer orally, having side effects of inhibiting the action of the cytokine throughout the body in addition to the inflammatory site, and being too expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an anti-inflammatory agent that overcomes the side effects and disadvantages described above, and accordingly, the demand for animal models that can more effectively screen anti-inflammatory agents and evaluate anti-inflammatory efficacy is also increasing.",
                                "Existing inflammatory disease animal models basically evaluate the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration or damage of the tissue by conducting histopathological evaluation in the tissue to evaluate the degree of inflammation, or the level of inflammation-related signaling proteins or inflammatory cytokines.",
                                "However, in the case of histopathological evaluation of inflammation, only the degree of inflammation at the time of autopsy is reflected in the evaluation because the tissue must be collected by autopsy of the animal, and there is a limit that the change in the inflammatory response before the autopsy is not known. In addition to the above evaluation, depending on the inflammatory disease model, if there are usable hematological inflammatory markers or when weight changes or behavioral changes are accompanied, these indicators may be additionally used for the inflammation evaluation. Since these indicators can be measured several times from the time of inflammation induction to the time of autopsy, it has the advantage of being able to indirectly confirm the changes in tissue inflammation over time. However, hematologic indicators, weight changes, and behavioral changes are lagging indicators that are affected and changed after tissue inflammation occurs, so the degree of inflammation at each point in time is not always reflected.",
                                "In view of this, the present inventors attempted to develop a mouse model for bio-imaging of inflammation capable of evaluating the degree of inflammation in a mouse in vitro at a desired time point without autopsy.",
                                "Accordingly, the present inventors prepared a mouse model expressing luciferase in accordance with the activation of NF-\u03ba inflammatory signals, and mated the model with a mouse expressing Cre recombinase specifically in certain cells and tissues to establish a mouse model capable of cell/tissue-specific bio-imaging of inflammatory signals. And the present inventors completed the present invention by confirming that the mouse model is effective as a mouse model for bio-imaging of inflammatory signals by confirming that the signal by luciferase increases in vitro when inflammation is induced in the mouse model."
