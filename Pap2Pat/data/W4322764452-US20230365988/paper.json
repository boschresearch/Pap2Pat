    "title": "Novel NF-\u03baB reporter mouse for the non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory diseases",
    "date": "2023-03-02",
    "abstract": "Bioluminescence imaging is useful for non-invasively monitoring inflammatory reactions associated with disease progression, and since NF-\u03baB is a pivotal transcription factor that alters expressions of inflammatory genes, we generated novel NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter (NF-\u03baB-Luc) mice to understand the dynamics of inflammatory responses in whole body, and also in various type of cells by crossing NF-\u03baB-Luc mice with cell-type specific Cre expressing mice (NF-\u03baB-Luc:[Cre]). Bioluminescence intensity was significantly increased in NF-\u03baB-Luc (NKL) mice exposed to inflammatory stimuli (PMA or LPS). Crossing NF-\u03baB-Luc mice with Alb-cre mice or Lyz-cre mice generated NF-\u03baB-Luc:Alb (NKLA) and NF-\u03baB-Luc:Lyz2 (NKLL) mice, respectively. NKLA and NKLL mice showed enhanced bioluminescence in liver and macrophages, respectively. To confirm that our reporter mice could be utilized for the non-invasive monitoring of inflammation in preclinical models, we conducted a DSS-induced colitis model and a CDAHFD-induced NASH model in our reporter mice. In both models, our reporter mice reflected the development of these diseases over time. In conclusion, we believe that our novel reporter mouse can be utilized as a non-invasive monitoring platform for inflammatory diseases.",

                "Inflammation is an essential body defense and necessary for healing1, but excessive and uncontrollable inflammation is a major pathogenic feature of inflammatory diseases2. As a result, inflammation is a therapeutic target, and many researchers and pharmaceutical companies have tried to understand the mechanism of the pathogeneses of inflammatory diseases and develop effective anti-inflammatory drugs with few side effects.",
                "NF-\u03baB (Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) is a pivotal transcription factor and regulator of inflammatory and immune responses. When activated, NF-\u03baB complex translocates to the nucleus, where it induces the expressions of proinflammatory genes including those of cytokines and chemokines3. Previous studies have reported the involvement of activated NF-\u03baB pathway in various inflammatory diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)4, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)5, rheumatoid arthritis6, atherosclerosis7, and multiple sclerosis8, and thus, NF-\u03baB is viewed as a propitious therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases9. Also, NF-\u03baB activation is commonly used experimentally to evaluate inflammation in vitro and in vivo.",
                "Usually, laboratory animals used for inflammation research and inflammation evaluation are sacrificed, and studies are performed postmortem on tissue and blood samples10. However, unless many animals are used to obtain results at multiple time points this type of analysis cannot reflect the dynamics of longitudinal inflammatory responses11. To overcome this limitation, In vivo live imaging techniques including optical imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography have been developed. In particular, optical imaging has been widely used in the live imaging field due to its sensitivity, safety, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness12.",
                "In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is one such optical imaging modality and is based on the detection of luminescence signals in living organisms expressing the luciferase reporter gene13. Luciferase is an oxidative enzyme that produces bioluminescence in the presence of its substrate, D-luciferin. During this enzyme\u2013substrate reaction, luciferase oxidizes D-luciferin and some of the energy produced is emitted as light, which can be quantified using a charge-coupled device (CCD) to yield information on biological processes14. As compared with fluorescence, luciferase signal has higher signal to background noise ratio than fluorescent which feature make bioluminescence more suitable for detection of weaker signals from internal organs15. Above all, in vivo BLI allows longitudinal monitoring without sacrifice11 and provides insights into complex and dynamic phenomena, while postmortem analysis provides only cross-sectional information.",
                "In vivo BLI has been used for various purposes, such as for luciferase-labeled exogenous cell tracking16, infection evaluations17, and gene activity reporting18. NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter mouse models have also been reported19,20, but these reporter mice expressed luciferase in all cells when NF-\u03baB was activated. However, inflammation is a complicated process, and each inflammatory disease has a unique pathogenesis that involves different cell types21. Whole body and specific cell inflammation assessments are crucial for studying inflammatory diseases and understanding their mechanisms.",
                "In this study, we generated a novel NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter mouse in a C57BL/6 background (NF-\u03baB-Luc) which can be further utilized as cell-type specific enhanced luciferase reporter mouse (NF-\u03baB-Luc:[Cre]) after crossed with cell-type specific Cre recombinase expressing mice to investigate the dynamics of inflammatory responses in aspect of specific cell-type as well as whole body."

                        "Bioluminescence has been applied in preclinical studies since it allows investigators to visualize disease-relevant in vivo events and reduces the number of mice utilized for in vivo spatiotemporal analyses29. In this study, we generated a novel NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter mouse line to non-invasively monitor the dynamics of whole body and specific cell inflammation (Fig.\u00a01A). The luciferase reporter gene cassette was inserted into ROSA26 allele to evaluate NF-\u03baB activation levels ubiquitously (NF-\u03baB-Luc), and the tdTomato fluorescence reporter gene under the control of ubiquitin C promoter was used as a selection marker. After crossed with cell-type specific Cre recombinase expressing mouse, luciferase activity following NF-\u03baB activation will be enhanced in that specific cell type through the intervention of CMV early enhancer/chicken \u03b2-actin (CAG) promoter (NF-\u03baB-Luc:[Cre]). Since PMA can induce inflammatory reactions via NF-\u03baB activation30, we used a PMA-induced ear inflammation model as a representative of inflammatory diseases in superficial tissues to determine whether bioluminescence can be induced by inflammatory stimuli. Regardless of PMA treatment, NF-\u03baB-Luc (NKL) mice showed tdTomato fluorescence in hairless regions (ears and noses) versus wild-type C57BL/6 mice (WT mice) (Fig.\u00a01B). WT mice did not produce any bioluminescence signals after D-luciferin injection, but bioluminescence signals were detected from D-luciferin injected NKL mice, and the intensities of these signals were much higher in PMA-treated ears than vehicle-treated ears in same mice (Fig.\u00a01B,C). To confirm the presence of PMA-induced ear inflammation, vehicle and PMA-treated ears were sectioned and HE stained. Though luminescence intensities differed, PMA induced histopathological changes in ear thicknesses and immune cells infiltrations were similar between WT mice and NKL mice (Fig.\u00a01D). These results showed our reporter mouse reflected inflammation status as luminescence intensity after applying topical inflammatory stimulus.Figure 1Generation of NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter mice.

LPS injected NKL mice showed stronger luminescence in the abdominal region than PBS injected NKL mice (Fig.\u00a02A), and this luminescence was significantly increased over time after LPS injection (Fig.\u00a02B). Elevated serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 which are well-known as pro-inflammatory cytokines confirmed that this increase in luminescence was due to LPS-induced systemic inflammation (Fig.\u00a02C).

In this study, we produced two NF-\u03baB-Luc:[Cre] mouse lines by crossing NF-\u03baB-Luc mice with Alb-cre or Lyz2-cre mice to generate hepatocyte-specific (NF-\u03baB-Luc:Alb ; NKLA) or myeloid cell-specific (NF-\u03baB-Luc:Lyz2 ; NKLL) enhanced NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter mouse lines, respectively. NKLA mouse showed enhanced luciferase activity in livers than NF-\u03baB-Luc mouse, whereas NKLL mouse showed enhanced luciferase activity in peritoneal organs, where peritoneal macrophages reside (Fig.\u00a03A). However, fluorescence intensities were similar among genotypes (Fig.\u00a03A). As observed in bioluminescence images, luciferase levels were enhanced in the liver tissues of NKLA mice and in the peritoneal macrophages of NKLL mice (Fig.\u00a03B). In addition, our reporter mouse is a useful source of primary cells containing a luciferase reporting system that responds to NF-\u03baB activation. Luciferase levels were increased by LPS treatment in BMDMs isolated from NKL mice and NKLL mice, but higher in BMDMs from NKLL mice than those from NKL mice (Fig.\u00a03C). Furthermore, luciferase levels were time- and dose-dependently increased by LPS treatment, and these increases were suppressed by BAY 11\u20137085, an NF-\u03baB inhibitor (Fig.\u00a03C,D). Consistently, primary hepatocytes isolated from NKLA mice showed higher luminescence intensities than primary hepatocytes isolated from NKL mice, and these luminescence intensities were increased by TNF\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a03E). Also, TNF\u03b1-induced increases of luminescence intensities in primary hepatocytes were downregulated by BAY 11-7085 (Fig.\u00a03F). Taken together, our reporter mice exhibited whole body (NF-\u03baB-Luc) and cell-type specific NF-\u03baB dependent bioluminescence (NF-\u03baB-Luc:[Cre]).Figure 3Generation of cell-type specific enhanced reporter mice and its ex vivo applications.

                        "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which includes Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a global health issue, and thus, there is an urgent need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible and develop effective drugs. Several animal models have been used in preclinical studies to evaluate the IBD targeting efficacies of candidate drugs. Of the preclinical animal models available, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model is the most widely used due to its rapidity, simplicity, reproducibility, and controllability32. Since NF-\u03baB is activated in macrophages during the development of IBD5, NKLL mice, which exhibit enhanced bioluminescence in macrophages, were treated with DSS to induce acute colitis to assess whether these reporter mice reflect myeloid-cell dependent inflammatory reactions. As was expected, abdominal bioluminescence was time-dependently increased by 3% (w/v) DSS (Fig.\u00a04A). Furthermore, luminescence intensities were significantly increased after 24\u00a0h of DSS treatment while body weights were unaffected (Fig.\u00a04B,C). Also, bioluminescence intensities were strongly correlated with disease activity scores (DAIs) (Fig.\u00a04D). Histopathologically, colons of DSS-treated mice showed changes typically associated with colitis, such as loss of epithelium, disruption of crypt structure, and infiltration of immune cells in mucosa and submucosa (Fig.\u00a04E). These results suggest that our reporter mice could be used to non-invasively monitor inflammatory reactions from the early stages of colitis development.Figure 4Non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory signals in the IBD model.

                        "The prevalence of obesity-related inflammatory diseases, particularly NASH, have increased in parallel with a worldwide increase in obesity33. Unfortunately, no drug has been FDA approved for the treatment of NASH despite the efforts of many researchers and pharmaceutical companies. However, genetically developed NASH and diet-induced NASH have been established for preclinical studies, and of these models, the CDAHFD (choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet)-induced NASH model, which also induces fibrosis, is considered rapid and reproducible34. Actually, even 1\u00a0week of CDAHFD treatment can induce NASH in mice35. Since the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is one of the major regulators of liver inflammation and NF-\u03baB is activated during the development NASH4,36, we treated NKL and NKLA mice with CDAHFD to determine whether our reporter mice could reflect hepatic inflammation. Bioluminescence in livers was higher after CDAHFD treatment that in those of normal chow diet controls for both genotypes, but bioluminescence intensities were several times higher in NKLA mice than in NKL mice (Fig.\u00a05A). On the other hand, serum AST levels (Fig.\u00a05B) and body weight changes were non-significantly different between genotypes (Fig.\u00a05C), indicating that the development of NASH was not dependent on genotype. In addition, though HE staining of liver tissues showed lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and immune cell infiltration increased over time after CDAHFD treatment, no differences were observed between genotypes (Fig.\u00a05D). Consistently, histopathological scores were increased by CDAHFD, but no genotype differences were observed (Fig.\u00a05E). Furthermore, for both genotypes, bioluminescence intensities and histological scores of liver tissues were positively correlated (Fig.\u00a05F). These results show that the devised mouse reporter system can be used to monitor inflammatory status non-invasively NASH development.Figure 5Non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory signals in the NASH model.

                "Inflammatory diseases have complicated pathologies and different mechanisms, and thus detailed experimental models are essential to understand inflammatory diseases and develop anti-inflammatory drugs. Usually, laboratory animal models are used to study inflammatory diseases, and postmortem analysis is used to evaluate inflammation severities10. However, although postmortem analysis provides valuable information on inflammatory states, it does not provide information on dynamic changes in inflammation. To overcome this shortcoming, BLI has been widely used to non-invasively monitor inflammatory reactions associated with disease progression.",
                "Since NF-\u03baB is one of the substantial transcription factors that alter the expressions of inflammatory genes, NF-\u03baB driven luciferase reporter systems have been used to detect inflammatory signals. Previous studies have described in vivo NF-\u03baB reporter models based on NF-\u03baB-driven luciferase19,20, but these models are based on whole body NF-\u03baB activation. However, inflammatory diseases involve different key cell types21, and thus, cell-type specific assessments of inflammation are required to understand these diseases comprehensively and aid target-specific drug development.",
                "In this study, we generated a novel NF-\u03baB driven luciferase reporter mouse which can be utilized as a reporter system reflecting inflammatory signals in whole animals or specific cell types by combining NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter system and Cre-loxP system (Fig.\u00a01A). The reporter gene cassette was inserted into the ROSA26 locus to enable stable expression and minimize unpredictable insertional effects. Also, based on considerations of compatibility with previously established mouse resources, we utilized C57BL/6 mice as a background, as they have been frequently used to establish Cre recombinase lines and knock-out lines37,38. Since the tdTomato reporter gene was used as an embryo selection marker when we produced reporter mice, NKL mice emanated tdTomato fluorescence signals, while C57BL/6 wild-type mice (WT mice) did not (Fig.\u00a01B). To evaluate whether NKL mice can reflect inflammation, we used a PMA-induced ear inflammation model as a representative model of inflammatory diseases of superficial organs. Bioluminescence was highly detected only from the PMA-treated ears of D-luciferin injected NKL mice (Fig.\u00a01B,C), while ear inflammation was similarly induced by PMA in WT mice and NKL mice (Fig.\u00a01D). These results confirmed that NKL mice can be used to monitor inflammatory signals from superficial organs and do not exhibit pathophysiological differences versus WT mice.",
                "The LPS-induced systemic inflammation model was performed to evaluate inflammatory signals originating from internal organs of our reporter mice. As was expected, inflammation was induced by LPS injection and was observed as an increase in bioluminescent signals (Fig.\u00a02A,B). In addition, serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 levels were elevated in our LPS-induced systemic inflammation model (Fig.\u00a02C), which is consistent with the induction of inflammatory cytokines by LPS through a toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway39. Moreover, we confirmed that the observed BLI (Fig.\u00a02A) was caused by the induction of luciferase expression (Fig.\u00a02D). These results suggest that our reporter mouse could be used to detect inflammatory signals from internal organs in vivo.",
                "We also produced cell-type specific NF-\u03baB driven luciferase reporter mice, NKLA and NKLL, by crossing NKL mice with Alb-cre and Lyz2-cre mice, respectively. NKLA mice showed enhanced bioluminescence in liver due to hepatocyte specific enhancement of luciferase expression, whereas NKLL mice showed enhanced bioluminescence from the abdominal cavity where peritoneal macrophages reside (Fig.\u00a03A). Similarly, luciferase levels were enhanced in liver and peritoneal macrophages from NKLA and NKLL mice, respectively (Fig.\u00a03B). We also isolated BMDMs and primary hepatocytes and stimulated them with LPS or TNF\u03b1 to determine whether the reporter system sufficiently reflected inflammatory status ex vivo. Luciferase expression was induced by LPS in BMDMs, and luminescence intensities in primary hepatocytes were increased by TNF\u03b1 treatment (Fig.\u00a03C,E). In addition, increases in luciferase levels or bioluminescence were down-regulated by BAY 11-7085, an NF-\u03baB inhibitor, which indicated these increases were due to NF-\u03baB activation (Fig.\u00a03D,F). These ex vivo results showed that the devised reporter mouse system can be used as a source of primary cells, and that primary cells containing the NF-\u03baB reporter system can be utilized for screening anti-inflammatory drugs.",
                "To validate the suitability of the described reporter mouse system for monitoring inflammatory reactions during the development of inflammatory diseases, we conducted two preclinical models, DSS-induced colitis mouse model and CDAHFD-induced NASH mouse model. First, we subjected NKLL mice to DSS-induced colitis, which has been used to mimic human IBD. Bioluminescence was found to increase over time after DSS supplementation (Fig.\u00a04A). Also, the elevation of luminescence intensity preceded loss of body weight (a symptom of ulcerative colitis) even after 24\u00a0h of DSS supplementation (Fig.\u00a04B,C), and a positive correlation was observed between luminescence intensities and DAIs (r\u2009=\u20090.813) (Fig.\u00a04D). Furthermore, the development of colitis was confirmed by HE staining of colons (Fig.\u00a04E). These results indicate that observed increases in luminescence were due to DSS-induced colitis.",
                "Next, we applied the CDAHFD-induced NASH model to NKL and NKLA mice to determine whether our reporter mouse could be used to detect NASH non-invasively. Bioluminescence from livers was brighter in CDAHFD treated mice than that in chow diet treated mice, and luminescence intensity was much greater for NKLA mice than for NKL mice (Fig.\u00a05A). On the other hand, we did not observe any significant difference in serum AST levels, which are used as a biomarker of liver injury and body weight and histopathological changes (Fig.\u00a05B\u2013D). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity scores (NAS) have been used to differentiate healthy individuals and those with NAFLD or NASH and can be applied to rodent NASH models. After two weeks of CDAHFD challenge, NAS, steatosis, and inflammatory scores were increased. However, no differences were observed between genotypes (Fig.\u00a05E), and these histopathological scores were positively correlated with liver luminescence intensities in reporter mice (Fig.\u00a05F). In particular, since bioluminescence signals from NKLA mice were much stronger than those from NKL mice, NKLA mice were considered to be more useful for the non-invasive monitoring of liver diseases.",
                "Taken together, our novel BLI-based reporter mouse can be utilized for the whole body and cell-type specific non-invasive monitoring of superficial and deep inflammatory diseases and that this reporter system could aid anti-inflammatory drug development."
