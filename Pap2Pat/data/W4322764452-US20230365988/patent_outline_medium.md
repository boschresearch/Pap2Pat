- describe method for preparing mouse model for bio-imaging of inflammatory signals
- detail step 1: preparing targeting vector by inserting gene cassette into mouse ROSA26 locus
- describe gene cassette structure and components
- detail step 2: preparing mouse embryonic stem cell clone by inserting targeting vector
- describe selecting clone with neomycin and performing Southern blotting
- detail step 3: inserting mouse embryonic stem cell clone into blastocyst
- describe step 4: implanting blastocyst into uterus of surrogate mouse
- detail step 5: preparing heterozygous mouse by mating with wild-type mouse
- describe mating mouse model with genetically engineered mouse expressing Cre recombinase
