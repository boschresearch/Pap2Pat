    "title": "Cas12a Base Editors Induce Efficient and Specific Editing with Low DNA Damage Response",

    "abstract": "Summary The advent of base editors (BEs) holds great potential for correcting pathogenic-related point mutations to treat relevant diseases. However, Cas9 nickase (nCas9)-derived BEs lead to DNA double-strand breaks, which can trigger unwanted DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that the original version of catalytically dead Cas12a (dCas12a)-conjugated BEs induce a basal level of DNA breaks and minimally activate DDR proteins, including H2AX, ATM, ATR, and p53. By fusing dCas12a with engineered human apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A), we further develop the BEACON ( b ase e diting induced by human A POBEC3A and C as12a with o ut D N A break) system to achieve enhanced deamination efficiency and editing specificity. Efficient C-to-T editing is achieved by BEACON in mammalian cells at levels comparable to AncBE4max, with only low levels of DDR and minimal RNA off-target mutations. Importantly, BEACON induces in\u00a0vivo base editing in mouse embryos, and targeted C-to-T conversions are detected in F0 mice.",

                        "The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been successfully applied in various living organisms for genome editing (Hsu et al., 2014;Knott and Doudna, 2018;Komor et al., 2017). The Cas9 nuclease generates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic loci under the direction of guide RNAs (gRNAs) (Cong et al., 2013;Jinek et al., 2013;Mali et al., 2013), which are further processed by downstream DNA repair pathways to induce gene editing outcomes. Therefore, the formation of DSBs is required for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. Although Cas9 nickase (nCas9) only generates DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)/activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) family members (Harris and Liddament, 2004) together with base excision repair proteins (Chen et al., 2014) can lead to DSBs during the repair of these SSBs (Lei et al., 2018). In addition, base editors (BEs) that link nCas9 with APOBEC1 are also associated with DSBs, demonstrated by the induced insertions or deletions (indels) of nucleotides around target sites (Komor et al., 2016;Lei et al., 2018;Nishida et al., 2016).",
                        "In most cases, DSBs are repaired through the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway (Ceccaldi et al., 2016) to yield indels (Chakrabarti et al., 2019;van Overbeek et al., 2016), which lead to knockout of protein-coding genes. Alternatively, DSBs can be resolved through homology-directed repair (HDR) in the present of a donor DNA (Ceccaldi et al., 2016), which can be used to induce precise sequence replacement. However, DSBs are highly toxic lesions (Chapman et al., 2012) and can trigger downstream DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways to disturb cellular homeostasis (Roos et al., 2016;Zhou and Elledge, 2000), e.g., cell proliferation (Haapaniemi et al., 2018;Ihry et al., 2018). Specifically, the generation of DSBs can trigger the autophosphorylation of the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (Shiloh and Ziv, 2013). Meanwhile, during the repair of DSB, an end resection process generates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions (Ceccaldi et al., 2016) and further activates another protein kinase, ATM and RAD3-related (ATR) (Cimprich and Cortez, 2008). ATM, and to some extent ATR, can phosphorylate the histone variant H2AX and tumor suppressor protein p53, which signal DSB repair (Mah et al., 2010) and then regulate the cell cycle (Bieging et al., 2014).",
                        "Cas12a (as known as Cpf1) is another CRISPR-Cas protein that is distinct from Cas9 in many aspects (Zetsche et al., 2015). Cas12a recognizes a T-rich PAM sequence, requires a short gRNA (CRISPR RNA, crRNA) and has been reported to have a generally higher targeting specificity than Cas9 (Kim et al., 2016;Kleinstiver et al., 2016Kleinstiver et al., , 2019;;Yan et al., 2017). These characteristics render Cas12a a promising gene editing platform. We have recently developed catalytically dead Cas12a (dCas12a)-derived BEs that were conjugated with rat APOBEC1 (rA1) (Li et al., 2018). In theory, dCas12a-derived BEs are unlikely to cause DSBs; therefore, unwanted DDR could be largely avoided. Nevertheless, dCas12a-BEs also induced much lower editing efficiencies than nCas9-BEs did (Gehrke et al., 2018;Huang et al., 2019;Koblan et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018;Thuronyi et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019), and in vivo base editing by dCas12a-BEs has not been achieved in animals. In this study, we confirmed that the early version of dCas12a-derived BEs induced very low levels of DDR. Furthermore, by screening and engineering different APOBEC/AID family members, we identified that highly efficient and specific C-to-T editing could be induced by human APOBEC3A (hA3A)-dCas12a-BEs, referred to as BEACON (base editing induced by human A3A and Cas12a without DNA break). With no toxic DSB and basal levels of DDR and RNA off-target (OT) effects, BEACON also induced in vivo base editing successfully in mouse embryos, and targeted C-to-T conversions were detected in F0 mice."

                        "Low Levels of DDR Induced by dCas12a-BE Different from Cas9-mediated genome editing, dCas12aderived BEs only deaminate one or a few cytosines in the ssDNA of the R-loop formed by gRNA at target sites, which will be converted to thymines after DNA replication. Given the fact that dCas12a is used as the Cas moiety, dCas12a-derived BEs theoretically are unlikely to generate DNA breaks or activate DDR cascades (Figure 1A). In contrast, nCas9-derived BEs triggered indel formation as the nCas9-generated nick would be converted to a DSB (Lei et al., 2018), which activates DDR proteins. Indeed, much higher levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gH2AX) were observed in cells treated with Cas9 or a nCas9-derived BE3 than those in cells treated with rA1-dCas12a-BE (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A). Correspondingly, the levels of phosphorylated p53 (p-p53), ATM (p-ATM), and ATR (p-ATR) in rA1-dCas12a-BE-treated cells were also lower than those in the cells treated with Cas9 or BE3 (Figures 1B,1C,and S1A). As shown in Figure S1B, rA1-dCas12a-BE induced almost no indel at the target site, whereas high levels of indels were observed with the Cas9 or BE3 treatment. In addition, the catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9)-derived BE2 also triggered low levels of DDR (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1A) and indels (Figure S1B), but it only induced base editing with limited efficiencies (Figure S1C). These results demonstrated that rA1-dCas12a-BE induced base editing with the least damage on genomic DNA."

Although rA1-dCas12a-BE induced purer C-to-T editing products and fewer indels than BE3, it induced ~4-fold lower C-to-T editing frequencies (median, p = 2 3 10 \u00c011 ; Figure S2E) than BE3 (~13% to 48%; Figure S2B) at seven selected disease-associated genomic loci.",

Among three newly constructed BEs (hA3A-dCas12a-BE, hA3B-dCas12a-BE, and hAID-dCas12a-BE) and one previously reported rA1-dCas12a-BE (Figure 2A), hA3A-dCas12a-BE induced the highest editing efficiency, which is ~4-fold higher than the original rA1-dCas12a-BE (median, p = 2 3 10 \u00c07 ; Figure 2C), across 15 genomic loci (Figure 2B). Further analysis showed that hA3A-dCas12a-BE induced the purest Cto-T editing as well (Figure 2D)."

                                "We then aimed to further improve the editing efficiency of hA3A-dCas12a-BE by engineering its hA3A moiety. According to the structure of hA3A in complex with a 5 0 -TC-containing ssDNA (Shi et al., 2017), the targeted C was usually accommodated in a grove that is formed by hA3A residues from active center loops (AC-loops) 1, 3, 5, and 7 (Figure 3A). Of the residues on these loops, His29, His70, Tyr130, Ser99, Asp131, and Tyr132 are directly involved in substrate coordination (Figure 3A, close up view in right panel). Thus, we opted to avoid mutating these residues and instead to choose aromatic AC-loop residues that are located on the peripheral of the ssDNA binding grove, i.e., Trp98 and Trp104, for subsequent engineering. Meanwhile, Pro134 was also selected for engineering, as proline is generally considered a secondary structure disruptor and the change of Pro134 may have effects on the flexibility of AC-loop 7. Molecular simulation of the corresponding hA3A mutants in complex with ssDNA ligands (Figure 3B) indicated that mutations of W104A and P134Y significantly strengthened the interaction between hA3A and ssDNA, whereas W98A largely destabilized the interaction (Figure 3B). Although the W98Y mutation alone seemed to not affect the binding of the ssDNA ligand (Figure 3B), it might loosen the nucleotide preference at \u00c01 positions (Shi et al., 2017). Thus, we introduced the amino acid changes of W98Y, W104A, and P134Y into the hA3A moiety of hA3A-dCas12a-BE, with the mutation W98A serving as the negative control (Figure 3C). In total, four engineered BEs (hA3A W98A -dCas12a-BE, hA3A W98Y -dCas12a-BE, hA3A W104A -dCas12a-BE, and hA3-A P134Y -dCas12a-BE) were obtained for subsequent comparison. Among them, three engineered BEs (hA3A W98Y -dCas12a-BE, hA3A W104A -dCas12a-BE, and hA3A P134Y -dCas12a-BE) induced higher editing frequencies than the wild-type hA3A-dCas12a-BE (median, 1.32-, 1.54-, and 1.40-fold; and p = 6 3 10 \u00c010 , 8 3 10 \u00c012 , and 3 3 10 \u00c016 , respectively), whereas hA3A W98A -dCas12a-BE showed decreased editing efficiency (Figure 3D). As a control, two mutations at amino acids (C101S and C106S) close to the enzymatic active site eliminated editing efficacy (Figure S3A). Next, we further combined the amino acid changes of W98Y, W104A, and P134Y to test whether these alternations can increase the editing efficiency in a synergistic manner (Figure 3F). The dual-change combinations of W98Y/W104A and   W104A/P134Y induced higher editing frequencies than W98Y/ P134Y (Figure 3G). Interestingly, the triple-change combination of W98Y/W104A/P134Y induced lower editing frequencies than the original hA3A-dCas12a-BE (Figure 3G), suggesting that the triple amino acid changes may compromise the cytidine-deaminase activity of hA3A. Among all engineered BEs, three of them (hA3A W104A -dCas12a-BE, hA3A W98Y/W104A -dCas12a-BE, and hA3A W104A/P134Y -dCas12a-BE) induced high levels of editing frequencies, i.e., 1.54-, 1.57-, and 1.64-fold of editing efficiencies relative to hA3A-dCas12a-BE (median, p = 8 3 10 \u00c012 , 2 3 10 \u00c013 , and 5 3 10 \u00c021 , respectively; Figures 3D and3G), and were used for further engineering.",
                                "Next, we also optimized the codons of these four BEs (Figure 4A) for mammalian expression to enhance their editing efficiencies (Koblan et al., 2018). As expected, editing efficiencies of these codon-optimized BEs (hA3A-dCas12a-BEop, hA3A W104A -dCas12a-BE-op, hA3A W98Y/W104A -dCas12a-BE-op, and hA3A W104A/P134Y -dCas12a-BE-op) were all significantly improved (Figure 4B). Among them, the engineered and codon-optimized ones (hA3A W104A -dCas12a-BE-op, hA3A W98Y/W104A -dCas12a-BE-op, and hA3A W104A/P134Y -dCas12a-BE-op) induced higher levels of editing frequencies (i.e., 1.55-, 1.71-, and 1.76-fold) than hA3A-dCas12a-BE-op with optimized codons only (Figure 4B, the far right panel). Of note, the engineering of hA3A or codon optimization did not substantially affect the product purity induced by corresponding BEs (Figures 3E,3H,and 4C).",
                                "Editing windows of hA3A W104A -dCas12a-BE-op, hA3A W98Y/ W104A -dCas12a-BE-op, and hA3A W104A/P134Y -dCas12a-BE-op were shown to be ~15 bp long (Figures 4D andS3B, positions 6-20, setting the PAM-proximal nucleotide as position 1).",
                                "Although large editing windows are useful for intended mutagenesis, e.g., creating stop codons to knock out genes (Billon et al., 2017;Kuscu et al., 2017), they were otherwise too wide for precise editing, as multiple cytosines might exist in the editing window (Rees and Liu, 2018). In order to narrow editing windows, we further introduced Y130F and/or Y132D, which were previously shown to narrow the editing windows of hA3A-conjugated BEs (Wang et al., 2018) into the engineered hA3As. Either Y130F or Y132D narrowed the editing windows while maintaining (or slightly affecting) editing efficiencies (Figures 4D,4E, 4F, and S3B). Interestingly, the introduction of Y130F or Y132D further reduced the formation of indels (Figures S3C-S3F) with an unknown mechanism. However, despite an even further narrowed editing window, simultaneous introduction of Y130F and Y132D led to a reduced editing efficiency (Figures 4F andS3B). Thus, we chose hA3A-dCas12a-BEs containing either Y130F or Y132D for subsequent analysis and designated them as BEACON (base editing induced by human A3A and Cas12a without DNA break). Hereafter, hA3A W104A/Y132D -dCas12a-BEop and hA3A W98Y/W104A/Y130F -dCas12a-BE-op are rereferred to as BEACON1 and BEACON2, respectively. Both BEACONs exhibit narrowed editing windows and induce low levels of indels (Figures 4D,S3D,and S3E)."

Across these sites, both BEACON1 and BEACON2 induced significantly higher editing than BE3 (median: 1.88-fold, p = 2 3 10 \u00c05 ; and median: 2.14-fold, p = 1 3 10 \u00c05 , respectively; Figure 5E) and reached levels similar to those of AncBE4max (Figure 5E). At some sites, BEACON2 induced even more efficient C-to-T editing than AncBE4max, e.g., sites BMPR2, PDE6C, and PMS2 (Figure 5B). In addition, the product purity yielded by BEACON2 was higher than that by BE3 (median C-to-T fraction, 99.26% versus 87.28%, p = 1 3 10 \u00c06 ; Figures 5C and5F) and similar to that by AncBE4max (median C-to-T fraction, 99.26% versus 97.80%, p = 0.0002; Figures 5C and5F). As BEACONs use dCas12a as the Cas moiety, they generated no DSB and only background levels of indels (Figure 5D), which were much lower than those by BE3 and An-cBE4max (Figure 5G). Importantly, the levels of DDR proteins in BEACON-treated cells were also lower than those in BE3-and Cas9-treated cells (Figures 5H, S4A, and S4B), consistent with the results that BEACON caused almost no toxic DSB (Figures 5D and5G). Correspondingly, BEACON2 led to less DSBs (Figure S4C) and fewer negative effects on cell proliferation than An-cBE4Max and Cas9 (Figure S4D), as DSBs can activate p53 and then lead to negative effects on cell proliferation (Haapaniemi et al., 2018;Ihry et al., 2018)  (legend on next page) Zhou et al., 2019). Thus, we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to determine whether BEACONs also trigger RNA OT mutations with RADAR (RNA-editing analysis pipeline to decode all twelve types of RNA-editing events) (Figures 6 andS4E).",
                                "In agreement with previous findings that A-to-I is the most common type of RNA editing event (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2018;Ramaswami et al., 2013;Zhu et al., 2013), only A-to-I RNA editing was found to be predominantly distributed in RNA-seq datasets from untransfected control cells or Cas9treated cells (Figure 6A). However, C-to-U RNA editing was dramatically increased in RNA-seq datasets from BE3-treated cells, demonstrating widespread and unintended RNA OT effects induced by the rA1 moiety of BE3 (Figures 6B and6C; Zhou et al., 2019). In contrast, much less RNA OT effects were observed in cells treated with AncBE4max, BEACON1, or BEACON2 (Figure 6B). Of note, the hA3A-Y130F-containing BEACON2 only induced RNA OT mutations similar to the background level (Figures 6B and6D), which is consistent with a basal level of RNA OT effects induced by previously reported hA3A-Y130F-conjugated BEs (Wang et al., 2018;Zhou et al., 2019)."

We co-injected the mRNA of BEACON1, BEA-CON2, or rA1-dCas12a-BE with the Hsd17b3-targeted crRNA into one-cell mouse embryos and then analyzed base-editing efficiencies at the blastocyst stage (Figure 7A). Among 8 and 14 embryos injected with BEACON1/crRNA and BEACON2/crRNA, respectively, 1 and 9 were found to bear edited cytosine at the Hsd17b3 locus (Figures 7B, S5C, andS5E). Deep-sequencing analysis confirmed the editing efficiencies at targeted C11 in these embryos (21.04% for BEACON1 and 17.04%-56.84% for BEACON2; Figure 7C). Meanwhile, only a basal level of editing was observed at four other nearby cytosines outside the editing window (C6, C14, C15, and C17; Figure 7C). In contrast, no edited embryo was detected in 11 embryos injected with rA1-dCas12a-BE/crRNA (Figures 7B andS5A). These results further demonstrated the improved in vivo editing efficiency by fusing engineered hA3A with dCas12a.",

A total of 24 pups were obtained from BEACON1-injected embryos (Figure 7D), and among them, 2 pups were edited (#7 and #11; Figure S5D) with the C11 editing frequencies at 57.73% or 23.10% in tails (Fig- ure 7E). Consistent with the results from mouse embryos, no edited mouse pup was found from the rA1-dCas12a-BE injected embryos (Figure S5B). To further confirm the base editing in mouse offspring, we dissected one BEACON1-edited offspring (#7) and determined the editing frequencies in different tissues. The editing frequencies in heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, and testis ranged from 51.34% to 71.24% (Figure 7E), similar to the editing frequency in the tail (Figure 7E). Finally, minimal indels were detected in the embryos or offspring treated with BEACONs (Figure S5F) and only a background level of distal OT editing (the base editing at OT sites where the crRNA potentially binds to) was detected in the tissues of the C11-edited mouse offspring (Figure S6), demonstrating the editing specificity induced by BEACON.",

Both BE3 and AncBE4max achieved very efficient C-to-T editing in injected mouse embryos (16 of 16 embryos edited and 14 of 15 embryos edited, respectively), and BEACON2 induced a relatively lower efficiency (8 of 15 embryos edited) (Figures S7A-S7D). These results suggested that the nickase activity is beneficial for in vivo editing efficiency.

                        "Great efforts have been made to develop more efficient and specific BEs for correcting pathogenic-related point mutations to treat relevant diseases (Ranzau and Komor, 2019;Rees and Liu, 2018;Yang et al., 2019), e.g., using nCas9 to boost editing efficiency and introducing alternations in the APOBEC moiety of BEs to suppress unwanted RNA editing (Gr\u20ac unewald et al., 2019;Komor et al., 2016;Nishida et al., 2016;Rees et al., 2019;Zhou et al., 2019). Besides the unwanted OT effects, nCas9-derived BEs also caused the formation of DSBs (Komor   , 2016;Lei et al., 2018;Nishida et al., 2016). DSBs can activate downstream DDR proteins, e.g., the phosphorylation of p53 and H2AX, to disturb cellular homeostasis and eventually cause cell death (Haapaniemi et al., 2018;Ihry et al., 2018), especially when simultaneous editing at multiple sites is pursued (Niu et al., 2017). In addition, it has been reported that DSBs also trigger large deletions or chromosomal rearrangements (Kosicki et al., 2018). As therapeutic applications of gene editing generally involve stem cells or primary cells, in which DDR pathways are active, the unavoidable DNA breaks induced by nCas9derived BEs may impede their applications in clinics. Different from nCas9-based BEs, DSBs that are induced by dCas12aconjugated BEs were barely detectable (Figures 5D and5G); also, dCas12a-conjugated BEs activate lower levels of DDR proteins, including gH2AX and p53 (Figure 5H), than nCas9-BEs, shedding new light on the potential of dCas12a-conjugated BEs in therapeutics. The original dCas12a-based BE exhibited relatively low editing efficiency (Li et al., 2018), which hampers its application in vivo. In this study, we screened different APOBEC/AID members and found that the fusion of hA3A-dCas12a could induce efficient base editing (Figure 2). With a series of structureguided protein engineering, codon optimization, and editing window narrowing (Figures 3 and4), we further developed the BEACON system, which induced high editing efficiency in mammalian cells (Figure 5) and in mouse embryos (Figure 7). The construction of BEACON also has several advantages in terms of editing precision. First, given that Cas12a has a generally high targeting specificity (Kim et al., 2016;Kleinstiver et al., 2016;Yan et al., 2017), we examined the editing induced by BEACON in vivo at predicted genomic OT sites and found BEA-CON induced undetectable OT editing at these sites (Figure S6). Moreover, BEACONs with the Y130F or Y132D alternation in the hA3A moiety have narrowed editing windows (Figures 4D,4E, 4F, and S3B), which enable precise base editing when multiple cytosines locate in a same target site (Figures 7C and7E). Finally, we also compared the RNA OT mutations triggered by various BEs and found that BEACON2 induced only background levels of OT editing transcriptome wide (Figure 6). Of note, the incorporation of hA3A in BEACON may also induce efficient base editing in methylated DNA regions and/or GpC sites, as previously developed hA3A-nCas9-BE did (Wang et al., 2018).",
                        "In summary, we developed a dCas12a-based BEACON system and successfully applied it for both in vitro and in vivo editing (Table S1). The BEACON system achieves efficient and specific base editing without generating DNA breaks or triggering DDR cascades, which is essential for its broad applications in mammalian cells and in clinics."

                        "STEP 1: RNA-seq read mapping. After quality control by FastQC (version 0.11.4, parameters: default), RNA-seq reads are trimmed by Trimmomatic (version 0.36, parameters: TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10 TRAILING:25 MINLEN:30) (Bolger et al., 2014) to remove read sequences with low quality, and then mapped to ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences by BWA-MEM algorithm (version 0.7.9a, parameters: default) to remove reads mapped to redundant rRNAs. To capture more mismatches for RNA editing candidates, a two-round unique mapping strategy is then applied to align high-quality RNA-seq reads to human hg38 reference genome, sequentially by HI-SAT2 (version 2.1.0, parameters:-rna-strandness RF-no-mixed-secondary-no-temp-splicesite-known-splicesite-infile-no-softclip-score-min L,-16,0-mp 7,7-rfg 0,7-rdg 0,7-max-seeds 20 -k 10-dta) (Kim et al., 2019) with up to two mismatches and by BWA-MEM (version, parameters: default). Unique mapped reads by HISAT2 and BWA-MEM with up to six mismatches are selected and combined for subsequent analysis. After marking duplicate reads identified by Picard (version 2.7.1, parameters: CREATE_IN-DEX = true VALIDATION_STRINGENCY = SILENT) in the BAM file, uniquely-mapped reads that span exon-exon junctions are split into segments by the GATK (version 4.1.2.0) (McKenna et al., 2010) command, SplitNCigarReads (parameters: default). Base quality scores of all uniquely-mapped reads are recalibrated by two GATK (version 4.1.2.0) commands, BaseRecalibrator (parameters: default) and ApplyBQSR (parameters: default).",

After filtering out RNA variants overlapped with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from dbSNP version 151 (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), the 1000 Genomes Project (https://www.internationalgenome.org/) and the University of Washington Exome Sequencing Project (https://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), low-quality RNA variants with mapped read numbers < 2, hits per billion-mapped-bases (HPB; Zhu et al., 2013) < 3 or editing ratio < 0.05 were further removed.",

Different to those in Alu regions, RNA variants in non-Alu repetitive and non-repetitive regions are further filtered with a series of stringent cutoffs to remove false positive. In brief, RNA variants in simple repeats, in mononucleotide microsatellites R 5 bp or within 4 bp of splice junctions are removed. In addition, BLAST-like alignment tool (BLAT, version 364, parameters: -repMatch = 2253 -stepSize = 5) (Kent, 2002) is used to remove RNA variants within highly similar regions. Finally, RNA variants within bidirectional transcription regions are also removed.",

Numbers of all twelve-types of RNA editing events are plotted by histograms according to their genomic locations in Alu, repetitive non-Alu and non-repetitive regions. Manhattan plots are further used to illustrate RNA editing ratios of selected types of RNA-editing events, such as C-to-U or A-to-G."

Figures depicting the interaction between hA3A and ssDNA were prepared using the Pymol program (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.1 Schro \u00a8dinger, LLC.) All mutant hA3A-DNA complex structures were modified from the structure of hA3A in complex with ssDNA (PDBid:5KEG) and then energy optimized using Protein Preparation Wizard from Schrodinger Suite 2019-1 (https://www.schrodinger.com) following default settings. The simulation systems were solvated with SPC water and neutralized, containing Cl\u00c0 and Na + ions at a concentration of 0.15 M to mimic physiological ionic strength. 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations were then performed with Desmond from Schrodinger Suite 2019-1(https://www.schrodinger.com), using OPLS3 force field. During the simulation, a Desmond implemented muti-stage MD simulation protocol was employed with Temperature T and pressure P kept constant at 310 K and 1 atm, respectively. The RMSD and RMSF of protein and DNA molecule as well as the protein-ligand contacts diagram were calculated with Simulation Interactions Diagram from Schrodinger Suite 2019-1 (https://www. schrodinger.com). The binding energy between hA3A variants and ssDNA along the simulation trajectory was calculated with third-party script thermal_mmgbsa.py from Schrodinger, with a step_size of 2."
