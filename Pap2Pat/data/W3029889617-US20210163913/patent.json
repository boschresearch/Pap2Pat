                        "Genome editing is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted or replaced in the genome of a living organism using engineered nucleases (molecular scissors). Utilizing genome editing tools to genetically manipulate the genome of cells and living organism has broad application interest in life sciences research, biotechnology/agricultural technology development and most importantly pharmaceutical/clinical innovation. For example, genome editing can be used to correct driver mutations underlying genetic diseases and thereby resulting in complete cure of these diseases in a living organism; genome editing can also be applied to engineer the genome of crops, thus increasing the yield of crops and conferring crops resistance to environmental contamination or pathogen infection; likewise, microbial genome transformation through accurate genome editing is of great significance in the development of renewable bio-energy.",
                        "CRISPR/Cas (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein) system has been the most powerful genomic editing tool since its conception for its unparalleled editing efficiency, convenience and the potential applications in living organism. Directed by guide RNA (gRNA), a Cas nuclease can generate DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) at the targeted genomic sites in various cells (both cell lines and cells from living organisms). These DSBs are then repaired by the endogenous DNA repair system, which could be utilized to perform desired genome editing.",
                        "In general, two major DNA repair pathways could be activated by DSBs, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ can introduce random insertions/deletions (indels) in the genomic DNA region around the DSBs, thereby leading to open reading frame (ORF) shift and ultimately gene inactivation. In contrast, when HDR is triggered, the genomic DNA sequence at target site could be replaced by the sequence of the exogenous donor DNA template through a homologous recombination mechanism, which can result in the correction of genetic mutation.",
                        "However, the practical efficiency of HDR-mediated gene correction is low (normally <5%) because the occurrence of homologous recombination is both cell type-specific and cell cycle-dependent and NHEJ is triggered more frequently than HDR is. The relatively low efficiency of HDR therefore limited the translation of CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools in the field of precision gene therapy (diseases-driven gene correction).",
                        "Base editors (BE), which integrate the CRISPR/Cas system with the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) cytosine deaminase family, were recently invented that greatly enhanced the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-meditated gene correction. Through fusion with Cas9 nickase (nCas9), the cytosine (C) deamination activity of rat APOBEC1 (rA1) can be purposely directed to the target bases in genome and to catalyze C to Thymine (T) substitutions at these bases.",
                        "However, current rA1-based BEs cannot efficiently edit C that follows a G (i.e., C of GpC), thereby limiting the genome targeting breadth. Therefore, creating new BEs that can efficiently edit C of GpC is highly desirable. Such new BEs will enable us to perform efficient base editing in a broader genomic space of various living organisms. Importantly, the high efficiency of such BEs on C of GpC will promote clinical translation, particularly in gene therapies that involve restoring disease-related GpT-to-GpC mutations."

Such base editing, surprisingly and unexpectedly, was effective even when the C follows a G (i.e., in a GpC dinucleotide context) or when the C is methylated.

After PCR amplification of the target genomic DNA, the C-to-T base editing efficiency at targeted site in genome were determined through Sanger DNA sequencing. As illustrated in two sgRNA target sites (sgFANCF-M-L6 and sgSITE4), efficient C-to-T base editing was executed on C of GpC through co-expressing hA3A-BE and sgRNA, as compared to co-expressing BE3 (APOBEC1-nCas9-UGI) and sgRNA (FIG. 1B, dashed box).",

By screening a variety of APOBEC/AID deaminases, this example shows that human APOBEC3A-conjugated BEs and versions engineered to have narrower editing windows can mediate efficient C-to-T base editing in regions with high methylation levels and GpC dinucleotide content.",

Numerous human diseases have been reported to be driven by point mutations in genomic DNAs. With recently developed BEs, these disease-related point mutations can be potentially corrected, providing new therapeutic options. By analyzing disease-related T-to-C mutations that can be theoretically reverted to thymines by BEs, the example found that \u02dc43% of them are on cytosines in the context of CpG dinucleotides (FIG. 5a). It is well known that C of CpG is usually methylated in mammalian cells, and methylation of C strongly suppresses cytidine deamination catalyzed by some APOBEC/AID deaminases. This example shows that CpG dinucleotide methylation hinders the C-to-T base editing by current BEs and has successfully developed BEs for efficient C-to-T base editing in highly methylated regions.",

                                "Results",
                                "This example first examined the base editing efficiency of a commonly used BE, the rat APOBEC1 (rA1)-based BE3, in human cells having either increased or decreased levels of methylation. When DNA methylation was promoted by DNMT3 in regions with native low methylation levels, editing frequencies by BE3 decreased. In addition, when DNA methylation was reduced by TET1 in regions with native high methylation levels, BE3-induced editing frequencies increased accordingly. These results suggest that the canonical rA1-based BE3 is less efficient in editing cytosines embedded in highly methylated genomic regions. Notably, C-to-T editing was suppressed by DNA methylation at both CpG and flanking non-CpG sites (median decrement \u02dc28%, P=2\u00d710\u22128 for CpG sites and \u02dc51%, P=7\u00d71040 for flanking non-CpG sites). APOBECs deaminate cytidines on single-stranded DNA in a processive manner. CpG methylation may affect the sliding of APOBEC and therefore impairs its binding on the flanking non-CpG sites for deamination.",
                                "To screen for efficient base editing in high-methylation background, a series of BEs was obtained by fusing Cas9 nickase with fifteen different APOBEC/AID deaminases (FIG. 5b). This example tested these BEs then in an E. coli-derived vector system (FIG. 5b), which has been previously used to probe mutations. In unmethylated vectors, these BEs showed varied levels of base editing. The BEs containing human APOBEC3A (hA3A-BE3, mean editing frequency \u02dc39%), human APOBEC3B (hA3B-BE3, mean editing frequency \u02dc33%) or human AID (hAID-BE3, mean editing frequency \u02dc28%) mediated base editing at levels that are comparable to BE3 (mean editing frequency \u02dc31%) (FIG. 5c). Whereas in methylated vectors, only hA3A-BE3 induced efficient base editing (mean editing frequency \u02dc35%), compared to relatively low editing efficiencies induced by BE3 (mean editing frequency \u02dc12%) or other examined BEs (mean editing frequencies \u02dc1%-20%) (FIG. 5c). Of note, protein products of hA3A-BE3, BE3 and other examined BEs are comparable (FIG. 5d).",
                                "Similar to the observation in E. coli-derived vectors, hA3A-BE3 exhibited significantly higher base editing frequencies than rA1-based BE3 in all tested genomic regions, either those with a native high-methylation background (median \u02dc1.7-fold, P=2\u00d710\u221210, FIG. 5e,f) or those with an induced high-methylation condition (median \u02dc1.8-fold, P=5\u00d710\u22124). Thus, using hA3A as the deaminase module in BE could generally achieve high base editing efficiency in genomic regions with high methylation levels.",
                                "The base editing on cytosines in a GpC context was observed to be generally inefficient by rA1-based BEs. While, this example found that hA3A-BE3 could induce efficient base editing on most of cyto sines at GpC sites in both endogenously and induced high-methylation backgrounds (FIG. 5e). This example further compared their editing efficiencies under both endogenously and induced low-methylation backgrounds and observed a similar superiority of hA3A-BE3 over BE3 on editing cytosines in the GpC context (FIG. 5g,h). Statistical analysis confirmed that the base editing efficiency induced by hA3A-BE3 was significantly higher than that induced by BE3 on cytosines in the GpC context in either high- (median \u02dc2.3-fold, P=1\u00d710\u22125) or low- (median \u02dc1.8-fold, P=6\u00d710\u22129) methylation conditions. Notably, hA3A-BE3-mediated base editing was as efficient as BE3 at cytosines in non-GpC contexts in all tested low-methylation regions (median \u02dc1.1-fold, P=0.045). This example also found that hA3A-BE3 yielded less non-C-to-T conversion than BE3 in both high- (median \u02dc97% by hA3A-BE3 comparing to \u02dc94% by BE3, P=3\u00d710) and low-methylation regions (median \u02dc92% by hA3A-BE3 comparing to \u02dc90% by BE3, P=4\u00d710\u22126). Both BE3 and hA3A-BE3 induced less non-C-to-T conversion at CpG sites with high methylation status than at CpG sites with low methylation status (median \u02dc95% vs \u02dc90%, P=3\u00d710\u22125 for BE3 and median \u02dc95% vs \u02dc92%, P=5\u00d710\u22124 for hA3A-BE3). This example also found that hA3A-BE3 induced higher indel frequencies than BE3 (median \u02dc2 in both high- and low-methylation regions). Such an increase may be caused by the high deaminase activity of hA3A, which can trigger downstream DNA repair pathways to generate DNA double strand breaks.",
                                "The results suggest that hA3A-BE3 can efficiently induce base editing in a broader scope (FIG. 5). However, the editing window of hA3A-BE3 is wider (\u02dc12 nt, position 2-13 in the sgRNA target site) than that of BE3 (\u02dc5 nt, position 4-8). As the wide editing window of hA3A-BE3 may result from the high deaminase activity of hA3A, mutations in hA3A that can reduce deaminase activity might correspondingly narrow the editing window of hA3A-BE3. Designated mutations (Y130F, D131Y or Y132D) successfully narrowed the editing window with little effect on the base editing efficiency, whereas mutations in the zinc-coordination motif almost completely eliminated the deaminase activity (C101S and C106S).",
                                "This example then focused on two engineered hA3A-BE3s (hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D), which have similar editing windows (position 3-8 for hA3A-BE3-Y130F and position 3-7 for hA3A-BE3-Y132D) as BE3 (position 4-8). In highly-methylated regions, hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D induced higher editing efficiencies than BE3 at all editable sites in overlapping editing windows (position 4-7) (FIG. 6a, cytosines in pink and FIG. 6b, median \u02dc2.3 fold, P=0.002 for hA3A-BE3-Y130F and median \u02dc1.2 fold, P=0.03 for hA3A-BE3-Y132D). For cytosines outside of overlapping editing windows, hA3A-BE3-Y132D induced C-to-T editing frequencies similar to BE3 while hA3A-BE3-Y130F induced higher editing frequencies (FIG. 6a, cytosines in black). Similar to the original hA3A-BE3, both engineered hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D edited cytosines in GpC contexts more efficiently than BE3 in overlapping editing windows (FIG. 6c,d, median \u02dc2.3 fold, P=3\u00d710\u22125 for hA3A-BE3-Y130F and median \u02dc1.9 fold, P=0.002 for hA3A-BE3-Y132D). Protein expression levels of hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D were very similar to that of BE3 (FIG. 6e), though the two engineered hA3A-BEs induced higher C-to-T editing efficiencies (FIG. 6b,d). In terms of product purity, we found that hA3A-BE3-Y130F yielded less non-C-to-T conversion (median \u02dc96.3% by hA3A-BE3-Y130F comparing to \u02dc95.6% by BE3, P=0.03 in high-methylation regions, median \u02dc92% by hA3A-BE3-Y130F comparing to \u02dc90% by BE3, P=0.002 in low-methylation regions) but more indels (median \u02dc2.1 fold, P=0.0002 in high-methylation regions, median \u02dc1.3 fold in low-methylation regions, P=0.12) than BE3. The product purity induced by hA3A-BE3-Y132D was higher than BE3 in native low-methylation regions (median \u02dc93% by hA3A-BE3-Y132D comparing to \u02dc90% by BE3, P=0.001), but lower in native high-methylation regions (median \u02dc94.9% by hA3A-BE3-Y132D comparing to \u02dc95.6% by BE3, P=0.03). Nevertheless, indel frequencies induced by hA3A-BE3-Y132D were comparable to those induced by BE3 at all tested sites (median \u02dc1.2 fold in both high- and low-methylation regions).",
                                "To further enhance C-to-T base editing system, three copies of the 2A-uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) sequence were fused to the C-terminus of hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D to develop hA3A-eBE-Y130F and hA3A-eBE-Y132D. In low-methylation regions, hA3A-eBE-Y130F and hA3A-eBE-Y132D induced significantly higher editing efficiencies (FIG. 6f,g, median \u02dc1.2 fold, P=0.0004 for hA3A-eBE-Y130F and median \u02dc1.2 fold, P=0.004 for hA3A-eBE-Y132D), higher product purity (FIG. 6h, median \u02dc96% by hA3A-eBE-Y130F comparing to \u02dc94% by hA3A-BE3-Y130F, P=0.006 and median \u02dc96% by hA3A-eBE-Y132D comparing to \u02dc92% by hA3A-BE3-Y132D, P=0.004) and lower indel frequencies (FIG. 6i, median decrement \u02dc21%, P=4\u00d710\u22125 for hA3A-eBE-Y130F and median decrement \u02dc9%, P=0.03 for hA3A-eBE-Y132D) than hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D, respectively. In high-methylation regions, hA3A-eBE-Y130F and hA3A-eBE-Y132D induced significantly higher product purity (median \u02dc97% by hA3A-eBE-Y130F comparing to \u02dc95% by hA3A-BE3-Y130F, P=0.003 and median \u02dc97% by hA3A-eBE-Y132D comparing to \u02dc95% by hA3A-BE3-Y132D, P=0.003) and lower indel frequencies (median decrement \u02dc23%, P=2\u00d710\u22127 for hA3A-eBE-Y130F and median decrement \u02dc21%, P=4\u00d710\u22125 for hA3A-eBE-Y132D) than hA3A-BE3-Y130F and hA3A-BE3-Y132D, respectively, though editing efficiencies remained the same (median \u02dc1 fold for hA3A-eBE-Y130F and hA3A-eBE-Y132D). Together, these results indicated that hA3A-BE3-Y130F, hA3A-BE3-Y132D, hA3A-eBE-Y130F and hA3A-eBE-Y132D can mediate highly efficient base editing in narrowed editing windows compared to the original hA3A-BE3 in all examined contexts.",
