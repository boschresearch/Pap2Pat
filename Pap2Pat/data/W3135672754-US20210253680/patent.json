Patients with SCI and TBI not only can lose neuronal function, but are at greater risk for neuropathic pain and other complications associated with loss of nervous control. Secondary injury accounts for major post-traumatic loss of neurological function. Part of the post-injury neuroinflammatory process is the activation of astrocytes and formation of a glial scar resulting in an impermeable milieu for axonal regeneration. The therapeutic goals include limitation of the size of lesions and axonal loss with the innovative approach of targeting astrocytes, a class of support cells that play a major role in supporting neuronal function and glial scar formation. However, there remains a need for compositions that can be used to successfully limit glial scar formation.",

Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, a specified molecule binds preferentially to a particular target and does not bind in a significant amount to other biologics present in the sample. Specific binding of an antibody to a target under such conditions requires the antibody be selected for its specificity to the target. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1988, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.",

Connexin proteins are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. Six connexin proteins make up one hemichannel, and 2 hemichannels make up 1 gap junction channel Gap junctions are a cluster of channels that are located in the plasma membrane between adjoining cells and they mediate intercellular communication. Hemichannels are a separate entity from gap junction channels. Hemichannels permit the exchange of molecules between the intracellular compartments and the extracellular environment.",
                        "Osteocytes express hemichannels known as connexin (Cx) 43 hemichannels. These osteocyte hemichannels are normally closed and can be opened when exposed to mechano-stimulation, which leads to the release of various factors into the bone microenvironment. The factors released by hemichannel opening can mediate other processes that can decrease tumor cell migration and bone metastasis.",
                        "Certain embodiments are directed to methods of identifying reagents that modulate the opening of connexin hemichannels. In certain aspects, the methods identify compounds or drugs that positively modulate the opening of connexin hemichannels. Other embodiments are directed to methods of treating cancer by administering a compound that open hemichannels to a patient having cancer, such as breast cancer or prostate cancer. In certain aspects, the patient has a primary tumor. In certain aspects, compounds that open Cx43 hemichannels can be used to inhibit or reduce metastasis to the bone. In other aspects, compounds that open Cx43 channels are used to treat osteoporosis, osteopenia, or osteosarcoma.",
                        "Cancer metastasis occurs when a cancer spreads from the part of the body where it originated (e.g., breast or prostate) to other parts of the body (e.g., liver or bone) and establishes a secondary tumor. The bone is one of the most common sites of cancer metastasis. Cancers that metastasize to bone include, but are not limited to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and skin cancers (e.g., melanoma). Bone metastasis can be identified in up to 75% of patients with advanced breast and prostate cancers. Bone metastasis (mets) are associated with many significant clinical and quality of life consequences, such as, but not limited to intractable pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord and nerve compression, bone marrow infiltration, and impaired motility. In many cases the systemic presence of a cancer can also make the cancer incurable.",
                        "Normal bone is made up of three major cell types: bone-forming osteoblasts, bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and osteocytes. Osteocytes make up approximately 95% of bone cells and maintain the bone remodeling process by coordinating osteolytic and osteoblastic activities. When cancer cells invade the bone, many of the normal bone functions are affected. Cancer cells interact with the local microenvironment to promote cancer cell survival via bone destruction and vascularization.",
                        "Cx43 hemichannels in osteocytes have been shown to open by treatment with alendronate (AD), an efficacious and commonly used bisphosphonate drug. Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs known for treating many bone disorders including bone metastasis. Powles et al. have shown administration of bisphosphonates to be associated with a decrease in the incidence of bone metastasis and a decrease in death rate in patients with breast cancer. AD has been associated with decreased tumor growth as well as reduced bone destruction and pain. AD inhibits osteoclast activity and induces the opening of Cx43 hemichannels in osteocytes (Plotkin et al., 2002). However, AD administration is accompanied by multiple, severe side-effects."

Variable light chain (VL) CDRs are herein defined to include residues at positions 27-32 (CDR1), 50-56 (CDR2), and 91-97 (CDR3). Variable heavy chain (VH) CDRs are herein defined to include residues at positions 27-33 (CDR1), 52-56 (CDR2), and 95-102 (CDR3).",

For example, in order to optimize the performance of a mutation at a given site, random mutagenesis may be conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antigen binding protein CDR variants screened for the optimal combination of desired activity. Techniques for making substitution mutations at predetermined sites in DNA having a known sequence are well known, for example, M13 primer mutagenesis and PCR mutagenesis. Screening of the mutants is done using assays of antigen binding protein activities as described herein.",
                                "Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues; insertions usually will be on the order of from about one (1) to about twenty (20) amino acid residues, although considerably larger insertions may be tolerated. Deletions range from about one (1) to about twenty (20) amino acid residues, although in some cases deletions may be much larger.",

It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \u201cantigen-binding portion\u201d of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL/VK, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fab\u2032 fragment, which is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, FUNDAMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY (Paul ed., 3rd ed. 1993); (iv) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (v) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; (vi) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; (vii) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR); and (viii) a nanobody, a heavy chain variable region containing a single variable domain and two constant domains.",

Rather, an antibody \u201cspecifically binds\u201d if its affinity for its intended target is about 5-fold greater when compared to its affinity for a non-target molecule. Suitably there is no significant cross-reaction or cross-binding with undesired substances. The affinity of the antibody will, for example, be at least about 5-fold, such as 10-fold, such as 25-fold, especially 50-fold, and particularly 100-fold or more, greater for a target molecule than its affinity for a non-target molecule. In some embodiments, specific binding between an antibody or other binding agent and an antigen means a binding affinity of at least 106 M-1. Antibodies may, for example, bind with affinities of at least about 107 M-1, such as between about 108 M-1 to about 109 M-1, about 109 M-1 to about 1010 or about 10-10\u00b0 M-1 to about 1011 M-1.

Fv, scFv, or diabody molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains. Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (Hu et al., 1996).",

(2003) describe \u201cantibody like binding peptidomimetics\u201d (ABiPs), which are peptides that act as pared-down antibodies and have certain advantages of longer serum half-life as well as less cumbersome synthesis methods.",
                                "Animals may be inoculated with an antigen, such as a Cx43 extracellular domain protein, in order to produce antibodies specific for Cx43 protein. Frequently an antigen is bound or conjugated to another molecule to enhance the immune response. As used herein, a conjugate is any peptide, polypeptide, protein, or non-proteinaceous substance bound to an antigen that is used to elicit an immune response in an animal. Antibodies produced in an animal in response to antigen inoculation comprise a variety of non-identical molecules (polyclonal antibodies) made from a variety of individual antibody producing B lymphocytes. A polyclonal antibody is a mixed population of antibody species, each of which may recognize a different epitope on the same antigen. Given the correct conditions for polyclonal antibody production in an animal, most of the antibodies in the animal's serum will recognize the collective epitopes on the antigenic compound to which the animal has been immunized. This specificity is further enhanced by affinity purification to select only those antibodies that recognize the antigen or epitope of interest.",
                                "A monoclonal antibody is a single species of antibody wherein every antibody molecule recognizes the same epitope because all antibody producing cells are derived from a single B-lymphocyte cell line. The methods for generating monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generally begin along the same lines as those for preparing polyclonal antibodies. In some embodiments, rodents such as mice and rats are used in generating monoclonal antibodies. In some embodiments, rabbit, sheep, or frog cells are used in generating monoclonal antibodies. The use of rats is well known and may provide certain advantages. Mice (e.g., BALB/c mice) are routinely used and generally give a high percentage of stable fusions.",
                                "Hybridoma technology involves the fusion of a single B lymphocyte from a mouse previously immunized with a Cx43 antigen with an immortal myeloma cell (usually mouse myeloma). This technology provides a method to propagate a single antibody-producing cell for an indefinite number of generations, such that unlimited quantities of structurally identical antibodies having the same antigen or epitope specificity (monoclonal antibodies) may be produced.",
                                "Plasma B cells may be isolated from freshly prepared rabbit peripheral blood mononuclear cells of immunized rabbits and further selected for Cx43 binding cells. After enrichment of antibody producing B cells, total RNA may be isolated and cDNA synthesized. DNA sequences of antibody variable regions from both heavy chains and light chains may be amplified, constructed into a phage display Fab expression vector, and transformed into E. coli. Cx43 specific binding Fab may be selected out through multiple rounds enrichment panning and sequenced. Selected Cx43 binding hits may be expressed as full length IgG in rabbit and rabbit/human chimeric forms using a mammalian expression vector system in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (Invitrogen) and purified using a protein G resin with a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation unit.",
                                "In one embodiment, the antibody is a chimeric antibody, for example, an antibody comprising antigen binding sequences from a non-human donor grafted to a heterologous non-human, human, or humanized sequence (e.g., framework and/or constant domain sequences). Methods have been developed to replace light and heavy chain constant domains of the monoclonal antibody with analogous domains of human origin, leaving the variable regions of the foreign antibody intact. Alternatively, \u201cfully human\u201d monoclonal antibodies are produced in mice transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes. Methods have also been developed to convert variable domains of monoclonal antibodies to more human form by recombinantly constructing antibody variable domains having both rodent, for example, mouse, and human amino acid sequences. In \u201chumanized\u201d monoclonal antibodies, only the hypervariable CDR is derived from mouse monoclonal antibodies, and the framework and constant regions are derived from human amino acid sequences (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513 and 6,881,557). It is thought that replacing amino acid sequences in the antibody that are characteristic of rodents with amino acid sequences found in the corresponding position of human antibodies will reduce the likelihood of adverse immune reaction during therapeutic use. A hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody may also be subject to genetic mutation or other changes, which may or may not alter the binding specificity of antibodies produced by the hybridoma.",

                                "Antibodies may be produced from any animal source, including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are ovine, murine (e.g., mouse and rat), rabbit, goat, bguinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken. In addition, newer technology permits the development of and screening for human antibodies from human combinatorial antibody libraries. For example, bacteriophage antibody expression technology allows specific antibodies to be produced in the absence of animal immunization, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,546, which is incorporated herein by reference. These techniques are further described in: Marks (1992); Stemmer (1994); Gram et al. (1992); Barbas et al. (1994); and Schier et al. (1996).",
                                "It is fully expected that antibodies to Cx43 will have the ability to neutralize or counteract the effects of Cx43 regardless of the animal species, monoclonal cell line, or other source of the antibody. Certain animal species may be less preferable for generating therapeutic antibodies because they may be more likely to cause allergic response due to activation of the complement system through the \u201cFc\u201d portion of the antibody. However, whole antibodies may be enzymatically digested into \u201cFc\u201d (complement binding) fragment, and into antibody fragments having the binding domain or CDR. Removal of the Fc portion reduces the likelihood that the antigen antibody fragment will elicit an undesirable immunological response, and thus, antibodies without Fc may be preferential for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. As described above, antibodies may also be constructed so as to be chimeric or partially or fully human, so as to reduce or eliminate the adverse immunological consequences resulting from administering to an animal an antibody that has been produced in, or has sequences from, other species.",
                                "Substitutional variants typically contain the exchange of one amino acid for another at one or more sites within the protein, and may be designed to modulate one or more properties of the polypeptide, with or without the loss of other functions or properties. Substitutions may be conservative, that is, one amino acid is replaced with one of similar shape and charge. Conservative substitutions are well known in the art and include, for example, the changes of: alanine to serine; arginine to lysine; asparagine to glutamine or histidine; aspartate to glutamate; cysteine to serine; glutamine to asparagine; glutamate to aspartate; glycine to proline; histidine to asparagine or glutamine; isoleucine to leucine or valine; leucine to valine or isoleucine; lysine to arginine; methionine to leucine or isoleucine; phenylalanine to tyrosine, leucine or methionine; serine to threonine; threonine to serine; tryptophan to tyrosine; tyrosine to tryptophan or phenylalanine; and valine to isoleucine or leucine. Alternatively, substitutions may be non-conservative such that a function or activity of the polypeptide is affected. Non-conservative changes typically involve substituting a residue with one that is chemically dissimilar, such as a polar or charged amino acid for a nonpolar or uncharged amino acid, and vice versa.",

Non-limiting examples of effector molecules that have been attached to antibodies include toxins, therapeutic enzymes, antibiotics, radio-labeled nucleotides and the like. By contrast, a reporter molecule is defined as any moiety that may be detected using an assay. Non-limiting examples of reporter molecules that have been conjugated to antibodies include enzymes, radiolabels, haptens, fluorescent labels, phosphorescent molecules, chemiluminescent molecules, chromophores, luminescent molecules, photoaffinity molecules, colored particles or ligands, such as biotin.",

Monoclonal antibodies may also be reacted with an enzyme in the presence of a coupling agent such as glutaraldehyde or periodate. Conjugates with fluorescein markers are prepared in the presence of these coupling agents or by reaction with an isothiocyanate."

Preferably, the carrier is suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or parenteral administration (e.g., by injection or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, i.e., antibody, or immunoconjugate, may be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the compound.",
                                "Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers that may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.",

Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.",
                                "Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.",
                                "Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying (lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof",

The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.01 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 1 percent to about 30 percent of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.",
                                "Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.",
                                "For administration of the antibody, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 0.3 mg/kg body weight, 1 mg/kg body weight, 3 mg/kg body weight, 5 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a month, once every 3 months or once every three to 6 months. Preferred dosage regimens for an anti-hemichannel antibody of the invention include 1 mg/kg body weight or 3 mg/kg body weight via intravenous administration, with the antibody being given using one of the following dosing schedules: (i) every four weeks for six dosages, then every three months; (ii) every three weeks; (iii) 3 mg/kg body weight once followed by 1 mg/kg body weight every three weeks.",
                                "In some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each antibody administered falls within the ranges indicated. Antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, for example, weekly, monthly, every three months or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of antibody to the target antigen in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of about 1-1000 \u03bcg/ml and in some methods about 25-300 \u03bcg/ml.",

In the context of cancer treatment, immunotherapeutics, generally, rely on the use of immune effector cells and molecules to target and destroy cancer cells. Rituximab (RITUXAN\u00ae) is such an example. The immune effector may be, for example, an antibody specific for some marker on the surface of a tumor cell. The antibody alone may serve as an effector of therapy or it may recruit other cells to actually affect cell killing. The antibody also may be conjugated to a drug or toxin (chemotherapeutic, radionuclide, ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, etc.) and serve as a targeting agent. Alternatively, the effector may be a lymphocyte carrying a surface molecule that interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a tumor cell target.
