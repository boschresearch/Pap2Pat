    "abstract": "Production of organic acids by microorganisms is of great importance for obtaining building-block chemicals from sustainable biomass. Extracellular accumulation of organic acids involved a series of transporters, which play important roles in the accumulation of specific organic acid while lack of systematic demonstration in eukaryotic microorganisms. To circumvent accumulation of by-product, efforts have being orchestrated to carboxylate transport mechanism for potential clue in Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06. Six endogenous putative transporter genes, YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D24607g, YALI0D20108g and YALI0E32901g, were identified. Transport characteristics and substrate specificities were further investigated using a carboxylate-transport-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. These transporters were expressed in Y . lipolytica WSH-Z06 to assess their roles in regulating extracellular keto acids accumulation. In a Y . lipolytica T1 line over expressing YALI0B19470g, \u03b1-ketoglutarate accumulated to 46.7 g\u00b7L \u22121 , whereas the concentration of pyruvate decreased to 12.3 g\u00b7L \u22121 . Systematic identification of these keto acids transporters would provide clues to further improve the accumulation of specific organic acids with higher efficiency in eukaryotic microorganisms.",

                        "To screen putative carboxylate transporters, 6611 proteins encoded by Y. lipolytica CLIB122 genome were obtained from the UniProt database. Of these, 1104 proteins (Supplementary S1) were predicted as transmembrane proteins by TMHMM v.2.0 (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, 117 proteins were excluded from this set, due to the presence of a possible signal peptide at the N terminus, as predicted by SignalP 4.1. A sequence search using a conserved carboxylate transporter signature of JEN family, NXXS/THXS/TQDXXXT, identified six putative proteins encoded by the YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D24607g, YALI0D20108g, and YALI0E32901g genes, which exhibited high similarity to the signature sequence. A multiple sequence alignment of these sequences using homologous carboxylate transporter sequences from other fungi confirmed the presence of the conserved sequence (Fig. 1B).",
                        "In addition, a high level of sequence similarity among these putative transporters and the characterized carboxylate transporters was illustrated by two BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) protocols, in which ScJen1p and KlJen2p were used as query sequences222324. In these cases, the identity to ScJen1p and to KlJen2p were prospected, respectively (Fig. 2). In silico analysis of these protein sequences using the TMRPres2D tool revealed that the conserved sequence was located in the predicted transmembrane helices (Fig. 3). Hence, these transmembrane proteins were suspected to be potential carboxylate transporters."

Initially, neither \u03b1-KG nor PA was detected in these cultures. During the first hour, the intracellular concentration of both carboxylates increased quickly to maximums of 3.90\u2005\u03bcmol\u00b7(mg\u00b7DCW)\u22121 for \u03b1-KG and 1.67\u2005\u03bcmol\u00b7(mg\u00b7DCW)\u22121 for PA in \u03b1-KG- and PA-treated cells, respectively. After incubation in YPK or YPP medium for 1\u2005h, the concentration of \u03b1-KG gradually decreased 1\u2005h to 3\u2005h, until the minimum of 0.85\u2005\u03bcmol\u00b7(mg\u00b7DCW)\u22121 was reached.

                        "To assay the effects of exogenous carboxylates on the expression profiles of these potential transporters, the expression of these genes were examined by qRT-PCR, using RNA extracted at 0\u2005h as the control. When intracellular \u03b1-KG levels increased, the expression of YALI0D20108g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D24607g, and YALI0E32901g decreased by 3.72 \u00b1 0.91-fold, 3.88 \u00b1 0.34-fold, 2.47 \u00b1 0.52-fold, and 1.60 \u00b1 0.18-fold, respectively, whereas the expression of YALI0B19470g and YALI0C15488g increased by 9.39 \u00b1 0.82-fold and 4.32 \u00b1 0.83-fold, respectively. Exogenous PA had a similar effect on expression, albeit to different levels. When incubated with PA, expression of YALI0D20108g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D24607g, and YALI0E32901g decreased by 5.83 \u00b1 0.81-fold, 4.04 \u00b1 1.04-fold, 6.44 \u00b1 0.98-fold, and 15.88 \u00b1 1.94-fold, respectively, whereas expression of YALI0B19470g and YALI0C15488g increased by 2.83 \u00b1 0.21-fold and 9.72 \u00b1 0.22-fold, respectively (Fig. 4B).

To completely abolish the uptake by endogenous transporters, the Ady2p was also disrupted in W1 strain.

Moreover, the parental strain as well as the W1 and W2 strains did not grow on citrate (Fig. 5).

Among the set, only the W4 could accumulate PA intracellularly (0.17\u2005\u03bcmol\u00b7(mg\u00b7DCW)\u22121). Based on these observations, we conclude that YALI0B19470g and YALI0D24607g encode proteins that transport dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates. In addition to PA, W4 cells (containing YALI0C15488p) also accumulated acetate, malate, \u03b1-KG, and citrate, indicating the corresponding protein also transported these carboxylates. In a similar manner, we conclude the proteins encoded by the corresponding genes transport the following carboxylates: YALI0C21406p for lactate, malate, \u03b1-KG, and citrate; YALI0D20108p for lactate, \u03b1-KG and citrate, and YALI0E32901p for acetate, malate, and citrate."

This ratio also decreased in YALI0C15488g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D24607g, and YALI0E32901g overexpressing strains, as only extracellular PA increased for T2, T3, T4, and T6.

The combination of increased carboxylate accumulation with decreased cell growth lead to a sharp increase in the yield of \u03b1-KG and PA, Y\u03b1-KG/DCW and YPA/DCW. Finally, the ratio of extracellular carboxylate to intracellular carboxylate increased, and maximum values of 2399.71 \u00b1 241.63 for \u03b1-KG and 1685.20 \u00b1 208.56 for PA were observed for the T1 strain.

The duplication of transporters and the flexible substrate specificity demonstrated by the identified carboxylate transporters facilitated extracellular accumulation of carboxylates. Moreover, knowledge of the examined carboxylate transport mechanism is a prerequisite for improving carboxylate synthesis through metabolic engineering. The results provide new insights for regulating extracellular carboxylate accumulation in similar eukaryotic microorganisms.",
                "To circumvent the issue of PA accumulation, previous studies have focused mainly on the regulation of intrinsic forces that redistribute carbon flux from other intermediates to \u03b1-KG production. Expression of PA carboxylase10, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarase3 dramatically decreased the accumulation of PA. A strategy to regulate co-factor regeneration resulted in remarkable reduction of extracellular PA15. However, as PA has a pivotal role in the regulation of carbon metabolism20, these modifications could not entirely overcome PA accumulation. As accumulation of carboxylate is believed to be a yeast defense response to severe environmental conditions27, regulation of carboxylate transportation process might be another potent route for enhancement of \u03b1-KG production.",
                "The carboxylate transport process of yeast is an intensively investigated field20. The S. cerevisiae ScJEN1 and ScADY2 genes were identified as key carboxylate transporters2829. The duplication of transporters has been strongly implicated in the utilization of organic acids as a carbon source24. In Kluyveromyces lactis, the presence of two carboxylate transporters, Jen1p and Jen2p, guaranteed efficient uptake of lactic acid as a substrate from a lactic-acid-producing habitat30. As the cells of Y. lipolytica harbored a powerful potential to use a wide range of substrates as a sources of carbon and energy31, these results indicated that powerful carboxylate transporters that maintain intracellular environment homeostasis. A previous study reported that reduction of by-product resulted in enhanced synthesis of target carboxylate by de-repression of the feedback inhibition3. It was speculated that the enhanced synthesis of \u03b1-KG could be achieved through de-repression of the feedback inhibition by efflux of intermediates.",
                "In Y. lipolytica, efficient carboxylate transport was achieved by the duplication of iso-functional transporters. Evolution analysis and motif identification confirmed that a precursor form of Jen1p, preJen1p, arose from the duplication of an ancestral Jen2p32. In S. cerevisiae, the transport capacity and substrate affinity of Jen1p were determined by the conserved NXXS/THXS/TQDXXXT sequence33. Presence of this signature sequence also determined the flexibility of substrate specificity for these transporters. Previously, Jen1p was induced by lactate, PA, and propionate, whereas Ady2p and Jen2p were induced by acetate2930. Expression of transporters from Y. lipolytica displayed different responses to exogenous carbon source, and single carboxylate induced multiple transporters.",
                "The roles of these carboxylate transporters were assayed via double their copy numbers in the genomic DNA of \u03b1-KG producer. One more copy of each endogenous carboxylate transporter was observed (Fig. 6). Our observation that overexpression of carboxylate transporters resulted in enhanced accumulation of extracellular carboxylates (Fig. 7). Previously, uncovered the mechanism for malate efflux was mediated by monoanionic malate concentration gradient, in which the proton symport was major force25. Similar to the observations that production of carboxylate was benefited from overexpression of carboxylate transporter1334, the efflux of carboxylate accompanied by symport of proton was speculated25. Based on measurement of total content of mixture of monoanionic, dianionic and undissociated form of the carboxylates, the intracellular content of carboxylates was not correlated with extracellular carboxylate content. While, the reported carboxylate transporter was specific for monoanionic form of carboxylate for efflux, the efflux specificity of this series of transporter would be the key to the contradictory observation in future studies."

For each protein, the transmembrane protein topology was predicted using TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The predicted result was visualized using the TMRPres2D tool40. The following values were used to discriminate helical proteins from other proteins41: (i) the number of predicted transmembrane helices; (ii) the expected number of residues in the transmembrane helices; and (iii) the expected number of transmembrane helices. To avoid false prediction, we also analyzed all proteins with putative transmembrane helices at the N terminus with SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) to predict whether the sequence encoded a signal peptide42. All screened transmembrane proteins were used for sequence-similarity searches using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to identify orthologs that have been characterized as carboxylate transporters."
