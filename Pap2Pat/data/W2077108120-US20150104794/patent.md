## CROSS-REFERENCES AND RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application claims the benefit of priority to Chinese Application No. 201310481832.5, entitled “A Genetically Engineered Yarrowia Lipolytica with Enhanced Extracellular Secretion of α-ketoglutarate”, filed Oct. 15, 2013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to the field of metabolic engineering, and more particularly relates to a genetically engineered strain of Yarrowia lipolytica with enhanced extracellular secretion of α-ketoglutarate.

2. Description of the Related Art

As one of important intermediates in tricarboxylic acid cycle, α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) not only plays a key role in metabolic processes of microorganism, such as energy metabolism and synthesis of amino acids, proteins and vitamins, but also plays an important role in the regulation of Carbon/Nitrogen metabolic balance in microorganisms. It is important for study of regulation mechanism of nitrogen metabolism in microbes. As an essential intermediate in fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry, α-KG is widely used in the synthesis of amino acids, vitamins and other small molecules, and has a wide range of applications in pharmaceutics, organic synthesis and nutritional supplement synthesis.

Due to the special role of α-KG in intracellular metabolism of microbes, when a large amount of α-KG is produced by screened strains during fermentation, it is unaviodable that a large amount of metabolism by-products, such as pyruvic acid, will accumulate in the final fermentation period. Short chain keto acids such as α-KG and pyruvic acid are weak electrolytes which exist in the form of neutral molecular or anion depending on the pH. As intercellular pH is higher than pKa of α-KG, α-KG and other organic acids predominately exist in their anion state. Excessive anions in cytoplasm result in the acidification of cytoplasm and interruption of cell metabolism. It is therefore necessary for α-KG in anion state to be transported cross cytoplasmic membranes by carboxylic acid transporter. However, when cells lack carbon source, carboxylic acid transporter will also need to transport specific carboxylates into cell as new carbon sources. Other carboxylic acids related to central metabolic pathway have similar secretion and absorption process. Therefore, the kinetic characteristics and regulation mechanism of specific carboxylic acid transporters located at cell membrane play a important role in regulating accumulation of carboxylic acids inside cells and in the fermentation broth.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The goal of the present invention is to provide a genetically engineered Yarrowia lipolytica (Y. lipolytica) WSH-Z06 with high levels of extracellular α-KG expression, which over-expresses one or more keto acid transporter genes.

The nucleotide sequences of the above mentioned keto acid transporter genes are the following:


- - (1) a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 (NCBI's accession number:
    XM_(—)501098.1, gene locus_tag: YALIOB19470g),
  - (2) a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 (NCBI's accession number:
    XM_(—)502090.1, gene locus_tag:YALI0C21406g),
  - (3) a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 (NCBI's accession number:
    XM_(—)503058.1, gene locus_tag: YALI0D20108g),
  - (4) a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 (NCBI accession number:
    XM_(—)504706.1, gene locus_tag:YALI0E32901g).

In a preferred embodiment, the gene encoded by the nucleic acid of Seq ID NO:1 is over-expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06, which results in increased levels of extracellular α-KG and decreased levels of extracellular pyruvic acid.

The Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06 was obtained from China center for type culture collection (CCTCC) with CCTCC NO: M207140.

The method for constructing the genetically engineered strains comprises the following steps:

(1) Constructing an integrative expression plasmid p0(hph) using hygromycin phosphotransferase as a selectable marker gene;

(2) Constructing a recombinant expression plasmid: synthesize the open reading frame (ORF) of putative keto acid transporter by total chemical synthesis based on the published nucleotide sequence by NCBI; digest the keto acid transporter ORF and the integrative plasmid p0(hph) at the same time using restriction enzyme Bam HI and Eco RI (or Not I and Eco RI) and connect the digested fragments of keto acid transporter ORF and p0(hph) to obtain a recombinant expression plasmid with the keto acid transporter ORF integrative into p0(hph) plasmid;

(3) Transforming the recombinant expression plasmid into Y. lipolytica WSH-Z06: linearize the recombinant expression plasmid using the restriction enzyme Avr II, transform linearized recombinant expression plasmid into Y. lipolytica WSH-Z06 using an electroporation method, and screen for and validate positive transformants.

The method for producing α-KG using the genetically engineered strain is as follows:

The genetically engineered strain containing the recombinant expression plasmid is inoculated into a seed culture medium, and cultured at 28° C., 200 rpm for 16-18 hours. The cultured cells were inoculated into 3 L fermentor with an inoculum size of 10% (v/v), and cultured at 28° C., 400 rpm for 144-168 hours with an aeration rate of 1.5 vvm.

Compared with a control group without overexpressing a putative keto acid transporter, the extracellular concentration of α-KG of the recombinant strains over-expressing genes of Seq ID NO: 1, Seq ID NO: 3, Seq ID NO: 4 and Seq ID NO: 6 increased from 16.6 g/L to 26.7, 18.6, 24.0 and 19.0 g/L, respectively.

The present invention provides four keto acid transporter genes which are able to increase extracellular expression of α-KG in Y. lipolytica cells. The present invention further provides Y. lipolytica cells transformed with one or more of the four keto acid transporter genes, which have enhanced extracellular expression of α-KG. Increasing extracellular expression of α-KG can simplify the downstream isolation and purification process, reduce the operation cost and increase the final yield.

The Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06 was obtained from China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC) with CCTCC NO: M20714.

Determination of extracellular keto acid concentration: fermentation samples were centrifuged at 12000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was diluted 50 times with ultrapure water, and keto acid concentration of the sample was determined using HPLC.

Determination of intercellular keto acid concentration: cells were collected by centrifugation, and washed by 0.9% physiological saline. Cell were resuspended in 10 mL buffer solution containing 0.1 mol·L−1 KH2PO4—K2HPO4, 1 mmol·L−1 EDTA, 0.01 mmol·L−1 DTT (pH 7.5). After addition of one volume of acid-washed quartz sand, cells were disrupted by a vortex mixer for 5 minutes, and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 minutes to remove the precipitation. 5 ml supernatant was filtered through a membrane with a pore size 0.22 μm.

### Example 1

**Screening for Putative Keto Acid Transporter Genes and Analysis of Conserved Sequences**

The method of screening for keto acid transporter genes comprises the following steps:


- (1) 6611 protein sequences of *Y. lipolytica* CLIB122 database were
  obtained from UniProt;
- (2) TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) is used to analyze
  transmembrane topology of these proteins and screen for putative
  transporter proteins. The putative transporter proteins are selected
  according to two criteria: (i) the number of residues in predicted
  transmenbrane helices is more than 18; (ii) the number of predicted
  transmenbrane helices is more than one. There are 1104 putative
  transporter protein sequences selected based on these selection
  criteria.
- (3) 117 sequences of the above transporter proteins were predicted to
  be signal peptides using SignalP, and thus were removed from further
  consideration.
- (4) The remaining putative transporter protein sequences were aligned
  with reference sequences, single keto acid transporter SACE0K00242g
  from *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and double keto acid transporter
  KLLA0F10043g from *Kluyveromyces lactis*, using Blast software. Six
  transporter protein sequences with more than 30% sequence homology
  with the reference sequences were selected as putative keto acid
  transporters of *Y. lipolytica* strain. The complete cDNA sequences
  encoding the six putative keto acid transporter proteins are
  identified as the following: Seq ID NO: 1 (NCBI's accession number:
  XM_(—)501098.1, gene locus_tags YALI0B19470g), Seq ID NO: 2 (NCBI's
  accession number: XM_(—)501871.0, gene locus_tags YALI0C15488g), Seq
  ID NO: 3 (NCBI's accession number: XM_(—)502090.1, gene
  locus_tag:YALI0C21406g), Seq ID NO: 4 (NCBI's accession number:
  XM_(—)503058.1, gene locus_tag:YALI0D20108g), Seq ID NO: 5 (NCBI's
  accession number: XM_(—)503239.1, gene locus_tag:YALI0D24607g) and Seq
  ID NO: 6 (NCBI's accession number: XM_(—)504706.1, gene locus_tag:
  YALI0E32901g), which have sequence homology of 37%, 40%, 41%, 42%,
  43%, 39% with SACE0K00242g (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) and 46%, 53%,
  49%, 52%, 51%, 51% with KLLA0F10043g (*Kluyveromyces lactis*),
  respectively.
- (5) Keto acid transporting activity of the six putative keto acid
  transporters was validated by quantitative real-time PCR, when the
  genes were transformed into *Y. lipolytica* cells, and the transformed
  cells were cultured in YPP or YPK medium using pyruvic acid or α-KG as
  the only carbon source.

The experimental results showed that the intracellular pyruvic acid and α-KG level was the highest in the first hour of cultivation when wild type Y. lipolytica cells were cultured in the medium using pyruvic acid or α-KG as the only carbon source (FIG. 1A).

Compared with the control cells cultured in YPD medium, cells cultured in YPP medium (using pyruvic acid as the only carbon source) have expression levels of YALI0B19470g and YALI0C15488g increased 2.8 and 9.7 fold, respectively, whereas the expression of YALI0C21406g, YALI0D20108g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g decreased 4.4, 5.8, 6.4 and 15.9 fold, respectively. Compared with the control cells cultured in YPD medium, cells cultured in YPK medium (using α-KG as the only carbon source) have expression levels of YALI0B19470g and YALI0C15488g increased 9.4 and 4.3 fold, respectively, whereas expression levels of YALI0C21406g, YALI0D20108g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g decreased 3.9, 3.7, 2.5 and 1.6 fold, respectively (FIG. 1B). These data indicated that the expression of these putative keto acid transporter genes are regulated by carboxylic acids.

The six putative keto acid transporters in Y. lipolytica, YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D20108g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g, were aligned with 21 known keto acid transporters from ten other fungoids using the software ClustalX2. The protein sequence alignment showed that all of 27 keto acid transporters sequences have the consensus residues NXX[S/T]HX[S/T]QDXXXT (FIG. 2), which is located at the seventh transmembrane region of YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D20108g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g.

### Example 2

**The Construction and Characterization of Recombinant Yarrowia lipolytica Strains**

Construction of p0(hph) integrative expression vector: PCR primers were designed and hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph) gene were amplified from pUB4-CRE plasmid. The amplified hph gene and p0 integrative plasmid (Zhou, J. W., X. X. Yin, et al. (2012). “Enhanced α-ketoglutarate production in Yarrowia lipolytica WSH-Z06 by alteration of the acetyl-CoA metabolism.” Journal of Biotechnology 161(3): 257-264) were digested by restriction enzyme Stu I and Hind III at the same time, and linked together to make an integrative expression vector p0(hph) with hygromycin phosphotransferase gene as a selection marker.

The complete open reading frame sequences (ORFs) of all the putative transporter genes were chemical synthesized. The p0(hph) plasmid and ORFs of YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0D20108g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g were digested by Eco RI and Bam HI, and were ligated together to make integrative express vectors p0(hph) containing transporter ORFs, resulting in plasmid p0(hph)-470, p0(hph)-488, p0(hph)-108, p0(hph)-607 and p0(hph)-901, respectively. The p0(hph) plasmid and the ORF of YALI0C21406g were digested by Not I and Eco RI, and were ligated together to make the integrative express vector p0(hph)-406.

All the six integrative expression vectors were linearized by Avr II and purified before transformation. The linearized vector fragments were transformed into Y. lipolytica WSH-Z06 using electroporation method as described above. The positive transformants were selected in YPD medium plates containing 400 mg·L−1 hygromycin B. Using primer pairs with a forward primer specific for a promoter sequence in p0(php) plasmid (VBF primer, Table 1) and a reverse primer specific for each of six putative keto acid transporters (primer V108, V406, V470, V488, V607 and V901, Table 1), a PCR was performed against genomic DNAs of positive transformants to determine if the ORFs of the transporters have been actually integrated into the genomic DNAs. As a result, six positive transformants with the transporter ORF sequences integrated into their genomes were identified and designated as Y. lipolytica T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 for the six transporter genes of YALI0D20108g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g, respectively. The six positive transformants and a wild type Y. lipolytica WSH-Z06 were cultured in YPD medium, and cells were collected during the exponential growth phase. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, the mRNA levels of the transformed transporter genes were measured in the recombinant strains and the wild type strains. The results showed that the fold change of mRNA levels of the transporter genes for Y. lipolytica T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 recombinant strains were 3.4, 9.3, 23.3, 8.5, 11.8 and 10.5, respectively, compared to that of the wild type strain (FIG. 3). The primer pairs used for qPCR analysis are listed in Table 2 with the corresponding gene followed by a letter “F” and “R” referring to a forward and reverse primer, respectively (e.g. YALI0D20108F and YALI0D20108R refer to the forward and reverse primer for gene YALI0D20108, respectively.). The ACT1F and ACT1R refer to the forward and reverse primer of the control gene actin.

### Example 3

**Verification of the Ability of Recombinant Y. lipolytica Strains to Transport Keto Acids**

The six recombinant strains lipolytica T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 were first inoculated into the agar slant containing seed medium, then transferred into 50 mL liquid seed medium in a 500 mL flask, and cultured at 28° C., 200 rpm for 16-18 hours. The cultured cells were inoculated into fermentation medium with a 10% (v/v) inoculum size, and cultured at 28° C., 200 rpm for 144-168 hours. The overexpression results showed that extracellular concentration of α-KG produced by recombinant strains lipolytica T1, T2, T3 and T6 increased to 24.0, 18.6, 26.7, and 19.0 g·L−1 from 16.6 g·L−1 of the wild type strain. However, the extracellular concentration of α-KG produced by recombinant strains lipolytica T4 and T5 had no significant change (FIG. 4).

The extracellular concentration of pyruvic acid produced by recombinant strains lipolytica T1, T2, T4, T5 and T6 increased to 13.5, 11.0, 10.2, 11.0 and 11.8 g·L−1, respectively, from 7.8 g·L−1 of the wild type strain. On the contrary, the extracellular concentration of pyruvic acid produced by Y. lipolytica T3 decreased to 5.3 g·L−1 from 7.8 g·L−1 (FIG. 4).

Compared with the control wild type strain, the ratio of extracellular α-KG to pyruvic acid produced by Y. lipolytica T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 changed from 2.1 to 1.8, 1.7, 5.0, 1.6, 1.5 and 1.6, respectively.

The present invention provides six keto acid transporter genes of Y. lipolytica strains: YALI0D20108g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0B19470g, YALI0C15488g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g, and the corresponding recombinant strains designated as Y. lipolytica T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6, respectively. All of the six identified transporter genes have the conserved amino acid sequences critical for the keto acid transporting activity. The expression levels of these six identified transporter genes were similarly regulated by pyruvic acid and α-KG. Two of the transporter genes, YALI0B19470g and YALI0C15488g, are up-regulated by both pyruvic acid and α-KG. Four of the transporter genes, YALI0D20108g, YALI0C21406g, YALI0D24607g and YALI0E32901g, are down-regulated by both pyruvic acid and α-KG. These data suggest that pyruvic acid and α-KG might regulate the expression of these genes in similar mechanisms. Overexpressing genes YALI0D20108g, YALI0C21406g and YALI0E32901g leads to enhanced expression of both pyruvic acid and α-KG, suggesting that these genes are multi-transporter that are able to transport these two keto acids. Overexpressing genes YALI0C15488g and YALI0D24607g lead to significant increase of extracellular pyruvic acid, but not α-KG, suggesting that these two transporters preferably transport pyruvic acid. The transporter encoded by YALI0B19470g is unique in that it increases extracellular level α-KG while decreases extracellular level of pyruic acid. Therefore, YALI0B19470g encoding keto acid transporter is a preferable choice for keto acid production.
