                        "Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the hydrostatic pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that surrounds and cushions the brain tissue of a human or animal. When the ICP becomes elevated in an individual, blood flow to the brain can become limited and lead to cerebral ischemic injury. Additionally, brain structures may become displaced (herniation) because of pressure differences within the cranial cavity and spinal canal, which may potentially lead to coma, cessation of breathing, and/or death. Elevation of ICP may occur in various neuropathological conditions, including hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, hemorrhagic stroke, and brain tumors. In managing these types of neuropathological conditions, it can be important to monitor the ICP of the individual to assess the cerebrovascular and cerebrospinal state of the individual and to determine if the ICP becomes elevated to a point that puts the individual at a high risk level.",
                        "Current clinical practices for monitoring ICP in a patient involve significantly invasive techniques which include penetrating the person's skull and inserting a catheter or pressure sensor to measure ICP directly in the cerebrospinal fluid space, such as the ventricles. Alternatively, pressure sensors can be placed into the brain tissue to measure brain tissue pressure as a surrogate for ICP. These techniques generally involve a physician with neurosurgical expertise to perform and have a risk of infection arising from entering a person's skull, which can limit these types of ICP measurements to individuals who are severely ill and are generally not performed across a broader group of patients where assessing their ICP may be beneficial. For example, monitoring ICP in a person who has chronic headaches may assist a physician in diagnosing or treating the person. However, it is unlikely that the person is in a medical state that would justify the medical resources involved in performing ICP measurements or the risk associated with obtaining such measurements.",
                        "Some less invasive techniques for estimating ICP involve using other physiological measurements that correlate with ICP or may otherwise act as a proxy for ICP. For example, one noninvasive method involves assessing the diameter of the optic nerve sheath. Another method involves applying external pressure on an individual's eyeball to balance retro-orbital pressure with ICP. In addition, there have been some computational techniques for estimating ICP that use physiological signals that can be obtained through noninvasive or less invasive means and apply these signals to a physiological model. However, these techniques have not been adapted in a clinical setting because they may lack the ability to obtain reliable estimates for ICP as well as the ability to perform continuous monitoring of an individual's ICP."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Computational techniques that incorporate physiological signals, such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), may be used in estimating intracranial pressure (ICP) for an individual. However, the inventors have recognized that conventional computational techniques for estimating ICP have limitations in the accuracy of the estimated ICP value and the ability to tailor the ICP estimates to a particular patient.",
                        "For example, some conventional techniques for estimating ICP involve mapping measurements of ABP and CBFV to measurements of ICP for a group of patients, the mapping then may be used in determining an ICP estimate for a different patient by applying the mapping to ABP and CBFV measurements of the patient. However, the inventors have recognized that to determine the mapping involves obtaining ICP measurements from patients by invasively penetrating the patient's skull and that generally these patients are being hospitalized in an environment, such as in the intensive care unit, where their own ICP is being monitored and controlled to obtain a stable ICP value. As a result, these ICP measurements used in developing the mapping do not necessarily accurately represent the range of ICP measurements in the overall population of people, or even in those patients with acute injury or exacerbation of underlying conditions, which can lead to inaccuracies in estimating ICPs for other individuals. In some instances, individuals that have ICP, ABP, and/or CBFV not represented in the patient data used in developing the mapping may have inaccurate estimates for ICP when their ABP and CBFV data is applied to the mapping because the mapping does not specifically account for their own particular physiology.",
                        "In addition, some conventional techniques for estimating ICP that rely on using ABP and CBFV in computing an ICP estimate do not account for any misalignment in the ABP and CBFV waveforms as this data is obtained in real-time from different devices. In particular, the ABP and CBFV waveforms acquired from different devices may not represent cardiovascular physiology in an accurate manner. For example, ABP measurements can be obtained at an extremity of a person, such as the person's finger or wrist, while CBFV measurements can be obtained at the person's head, such as by using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. A time shift between ABP measurements obtained at a location of the person that differs from where the CBFV measurements are obtained may create a physiologically induced time delay between the ABP waveform arriving at the cerebral artery and the ABP waveform at the actual measurement location. Although the ABP and CBFV measurements are obtained at the same time, this physiological time delay is represented in these measurements and can lead to misalignment between the ABP and CBFV waveforms in a manner that represents inaccurate or impossible physiology. In particular, cardiac cycles have quasi-regular, repeated characteristics in ABP and CBFV waveforms which are representative of the underlying cardiovascular physiology. During a cardiac cycle, a systolic peak in the CBFV waveform generally leads the corresponding systolic peak in the ABP waveform and the diastolic points in the ABP and CBFV waveforms are aligned with each other. A misalignment that arises from obtaining ABP and CBFV measurements from different locations of a person's body may create a combination of ABP and CBFV waveforms that represents physiologically inaccurate or impossible cardiac cycles. For example, one type of misalignment may include a systolic peak in the CBFV waveform following the corresponding systolic peak in the ABP waveform during the same cardiac cycle. Another type of misalignment may include the diastolic points in the ABP and CBFV waveforms not in alignment. These misalignments can lead to inaccurate estimates for ICP if not accounted for when computing an ICP using the misaligned ABP and CBFV waveforms.",
                        "Accordingly, the inventors have developed new computational techniques for estimating ICP, which accounts for the lack of physiological data representative of a cross-section of the population as well as possible misalignments in the physiological data (e.g., ABP, CBFV) being used in estimating ICP. These new computational techniques involve using a statistical model, which incorporates elements representative of cerebrovascular and cerebrospinal physiology, to estimate intracranial pressure values based on ABP and CBFV data from a patient. Estimating an intracranial pressure value may involve using the statistical model to compute an initial ICP for a patient and changes in ICP relative to that initial ICP value, which when added to the initial ICP value may provide an estimate of ICP for the patient at a particular time. For example, an initial ICP value may be obtained for ABP and CBFV data associated with a first time period and then subsequent ABP and CBFV data obtained from the patient may be used to track changes relative to that initial ICP value for subsequent time periods. Those changes in ICP may be combined with the initial ICP value to estimate an ICP value at for a particular time period. In this manner, a patient's ICP may be monitoring in real-time and dynamically updated using noninvasive physiological measurements.",
                        "The computational techniques developed by the inventors involve computing the initial ICP value using ABP and CBFV data from a patient, and may include incorporating data obtained from other people, and computing the changes in ICP value using additional ABP and CBFV data from the patient with or without other data from another person. The inventors have recognized and appreciated that while data from someone other than the patient whose ICP is being monitored may be important in computing an initial ICP value, using such data may introduce biases in the ICP estimates and provide inaccurate ICP estimates. Estimating changes in ICP using the patient's own data may account and compensate for such biases as additional patient data is obtained over time because there is less of reliance on data from people other than the patient.",
                        "The inventors have further recognized and appreciated that inaccuracy in estimating ICP can arise from misalignment in ABP and CBFV waveforms. For example, obtaining ABP and CBFV measurements at different locations of a person at the same time may introduce a physiological time delay that, when not accounted for, can lead to inaccurate estimates in ICP. As another example, the devices used in obtaining the ABP and CBFV measurements may have internal time delays. Accordingly, some embodiments of the technology described herein relates to introducing time offsets as parameters of the statistical model to account for misalignment in ABP and CBFV waveforms. In particular, computing an estimate for ICP in a patient may involve determining one or more time offset values that align the ABP and CBFV waveforms in time to meet certain physiological constraints.",
                        "Some embodiments described herein address all of the above-described issues that the inventors have recognized with estimating ICP. However, not every embodiment described herein addresses every one of these issues, and some embodiments may not address any of them. As such, it should be appreciated that embodiments of the technology described herein are not limited to addressing all or any of the above-discussed issues with estimating ICP.",
                        "Some embodiments involve obtaining data identifying arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) of a patient, estimating an initial intracranial pressure (ICP) value for the patient, estimating an updated ICP value for the patient by determining a change in ICP of the patient based on the data, and outputting information indicating the updated ICP value. The ABP and CBFV data may be obtained over multiple cardiac cycles, and estimating the initial ICP and changes in ICP may involve using data associated with one or more cardiac cycles.",
                        "Estimating the initial ICP value may involve using a statistical model to compute a posterior distribution of ICP values based on a set of ABP and CBFV data and a prior distribution of ICP values. In some embodiments, the prior distribution of ICP values correspond to data obtained from at least one person other than the patient. The statistical model relates arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity to intracranial pressure. In some embodiments, the statistical model includes a parameter representing cerebrovascular resistance, a parameter representing cerebrovascular compliance, and a parameter representing intracranial pressure. Estimating an updated ICP value for the patient may involve determining a change in ICP of the patient based on a different set of ABP and CBFV data and the initial ICP value. These techniques may be applied to monitoring a patient's ICP in real-time such that the patient's ICP value is updated to reflect current ABP and CBFV data obtained from the patient over time. For example, the initial ICP value may be computed from a patient's ABP and CBFV data obtained during a first time period and individual updates in ICP may be computed from the patient's ABP and CBFV data obtained from subsequent time periods, where an update in ICP is computed for the individual subsequent time periods and subsequently combined with the initial ICP value to estimate an ICP value for a particular time period. Accordingly, some embodiments involve estimating a series of ICP values for the patient by determining changes in ICP of the patient based on patient data and combining changes in ICP with the initial ICP value. In some embodiments, estimating the series of ICP values involves dynamically updating an ICP value as patient data is obtained. The dynamic updating of the ICP value may be performed in an adaptive manner.",
                        "Some embodiments involve using Bayesian statistics in estimating ICP from patient data. In some embodiments, estimating an ICP value involves using the statistical model to compute a posterior distribution of ICP values based on a likelihood of ICP given the patient data and a prior distribution of ICP values. In some embodiments, the prior distribution of ICP values may be associated with data from other patients. Such a prior distribution may be used in determining the initial ICP value. In some embodiments, the prior distribution of ICP values may be generated from user input. For example, a uniform prior distribution having the same probability across all ICP values may be inputted by a user and used in determining a change in ICP.",
                        "Some embodiments may involve evaluating whether a time period in the patient data is of low quality, noisy, or otherwise may contribute to an inaccurate ICP estimate. For example, an ICP value may be estimated for a particular timeframe and time periods within that timeframe may each provide an estimated ICP value that may be combined to determine the estimated ICP value for the timeframe. In some embodiments, some of the time periods have data of low quality (e.g., where the patient moved suddenly and disrupted one or both of the ABP and CBFV measurements during the time period). The inventors have recognized and appreciated that it is important to remove or reduce these low quality time periods in estimating an ICP value for the entire timeframe. In some embodiments, estimating an ICP value for a timeframe may involve computing an ICP value using the patient data for a time period within the timeframe, determining a metric indicative of the level of noise in the patient data for the time period, and selecting to include the ICP value for the time period in estimating the ICP value for the timeframe based on comparing the metric to a threshold value. For example, if the metric is above a threshold value, then the ICP value for the time period is not included in estimating the ICP value for the timeframe.",
                        "Some embodiments involve determining changes in ICP using the statistical model and ABP and CBFV data to estimate values for parameters of the statistical model. The inventors have further recognized and appreciated that computational costs and overall efficiency in estimating ICP values may be reduced by using optimization techniques that allow for estimating values for parameters of the statistical model by evaluating different values for parameters independently. In some instances, monitoring ICP in a patient may involve computing ICP estimates during different time periods where the time periods have relevant time scales in the range of 5 seconds to 60 seconds. Estimating an ICP value for a particular time period may involve computing values for parameters of the statistical model to use in computing an ICP value or change in ICP during that time period. For different time periods, the values for the parameters of the statistical model may need to be updated to reflect the data associated with that time period. Accordingly, to allow for monitoring of a patient's ICP as data is obtained involves computing values for these parameters at least within the time scales where providing ICP estimates in real-time is desired. Determining an estimated ICP value for a certain time period may involve evaluating particular values for parameters using patient data during that time period. By providing particular values of parameters to evaluate, computational costs may be reduced, which may allow for ICP estimates to be obtained within a desired timeframe at the time scale of one or more cardiac cycles. In some embodiments, evaluating the parameter values for a particular time period may involve evaluating different combinations of possible parameter values for that time period using parallel computing techniques, which may improve computational efficiency and reduce computational time associated with providing an updated ICP value.",
                        "Some embodiments may involve predicting an ICP value using ABP and CBFV data from a patient. The predicted ICP value may be obtained by estimating a change in ICP for a future time using the patient data and the statistical model and combining the estimated change in ICP with one or more previously determined ICP values. In particular, values for parameters of the statistical model may be estimated using the patient data and those estimated parameter values may be used in estimating the change in ICP for the future time. These predictions in ICP may assist in monitoring ICP of a patient by assessing how the patient's ICP may change in the future, such as whether ICP is likely to remain at a stable value or become elevated. In some embodiments, estimating an updated ICP value may involve computing an data-derived ICP value for a time interval using the data obtained during that interval and a predicted change in ICP for the time interval using data from a prior time interval, determining an estimated change in ICP based on the predicted change in ICP and the data-derived ICP, and using this estimated change in ICP to estimate the updated ICP value.",
                        "In some embodiments, evaluating possible values for parameters of the statistical model may involve predicting a change in ICP for a time period using patient data from a prior time period. The predicted change in ICP may be compared to a data-derived change in ICP value estimated for the time period using data from that time period. If the predicted and data-derived changes in ICP estimates are similar, then the parameter values used in obtaining the predicted and data-derived changes in ICP estimates may be determined to have a high level of accuracy in estimating ICP. While, if the predicted and data-derived changes in ICP have significant variability, then the parameter values may be determined as having a low level of accuracy in estimating ICP.",
                        "In some embodiment, a time offset between ABP and CBFV waveforms is a parameter of the statistical model and evaluating parameter values may involve evaluating intracranial pressure values at different time offsets. The time offsets may be selected from a range of time offsets obtained by aligning the ABP and CBFV waveforms using physiological constraints. In some embodiments, a range of time offsets may be identified from aligning the ABP and CBFV waveforms and one or more time offset values may be selected from the range based on whether the ABP and CBFV waveforms meet a set of physiological constraints when a particular time offset is used in shifting the ABP and CBFV waveforms relative to one another. One type of physiological constraint that may be used in aligning the ABP and CBFV waveforms is having a systolic peak in CBFV occur prior to a systolic peak in ABP for the corresponding cardiac cycle. Another type of physiological constraint that may be used in aligning the ABP and CBFV waveforms is having a diastolic point in CBFV occur at substantially the same time as a diastolic point in ABP in the same cardiac cycle.",
                        "Some embodiments involve predicting physiological signals (e.g., ABP, CBFV) for a patient using the statistical model and patient data to evaluate multiple ICP values corresponding to different time offsets between ABP and CBFV waveforms. Prediction errors may be determined by comparing predicted values for the physiological signals to the patient data. The prediction errors may be used in computing a likelihood of ICP, which may be used in estimating an ICP. In some embodiments, computing the likelihood of ICP may involve determining a likelihood distribution of ICP for different time offsets from prediction errors associated with using the time offset in computing a physiological signal.

                        "A noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) estimation method is proposed that incorporates model-based estimation within a probabilistic framework. A first-order subject-specific model of the cerebral vasculature relates arterial blood pressure with cerebral blood flow velocity. The model is solved for a range of physiologically plausible mean ICP values, and the resulting residual errors are transformed into likelihoods for each candidate ICP. First, a baseline ICP estimate is established by combining the likelihoods with a multi-modal prior distribution of the ICP to yield an a posteriori distribution whose mode is taken as the baseline ICP estimate. A single-state model of cerebral autoregulatory dynamics is then employed in subsequent data windows to track changes in the baseline by combining ICP estimates obtained with a uniform prior belief and model-predicted ICPs. The method yielded an ICP estimation bias (mean error or accuracy) of 0.6 mmHg and a root-mean-squared error (or precision) of 4.2 mmHg on data from thirteen patients at Boston Children's Hospital. These performance characteristics are well within the acceptable range for clinical decision making. The method proposed here therefore constitutes a significant step towards robust, continuous, patient-specific noninvasive ICP determination.",

                        "Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the hydrostatic pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that surrounds and cushions human brain tissue. Elevated ICP hampers brain tissue perfusion, and can lead to severe cerebral ischemic injury. Such elevations can occur in neuropathological conditions that include hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury (TBI), hemorrhagic stroke, and brain tumors. Severe TBI, for example, is estimated to cause 52,000 deaths annually in the United States. TBI management requires accurate ICP measurement, as does hydrocephalus care, which is estimated to incur over US$1 billion annually in the U.S.",
                        "The normal mean ICP range in healthy adults in the supine posture is reported to range from 6 to 18 mmHg. In children, normal mean ICP to may range from 8 to 21 mmHg. ICP elevations beyond this normal range are lowered aggressively in current clinical practice. The latest guidelines for TBI care, for instance, recommend maintaining mean ICP of less than 22 mmHg.",
                        "Clinical ICP measurement modalities are invasive, require neurosurgical expertise, and carry an associated risk of infection. ICP measurement is therefore used only for severely ill patients, despite the fact that a larger pool of subjects may otherwise benefit from direct ICP measurement. This potential need has prompted the development of noninvasive ICP (nICP) estimation schemes. Examples of nICP estimation methods include applying external pressure on the eyeball to balance retro-orbital pressure with ICP, measuring cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) indices, and exploiting transcranial acoustic signal properties. Tympanic membrane displacement, and optic nerve sheath distension have also been shown to correlate with ICP. Physiologic model-based methods have been proposed, along with statistical learning frameworks. Despite these efforts, reliable and continuous nICP estimation has remained elusive and has not been adopted in clinical practice.",
                        "In this paper, we present a robust physiologic nICP estimation and tracking scheme. We model cerebral hemodynamics with a first-order, time-varying, finite impulse response (FIR) filter that relates cerebral arterial blood pressure (cABP), ICP, and CBFV. This model incorporates a first-order autoregressive (AR) process description of ICP dynamics. We use CBFV measured via transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography and radial arterial blood pressure (rABP). An associated Bayesian estimation framework is proposed to compute nICP estimates that are robust against both morphological differences between rABP and cABP, and physiologically-induced time offsets between rABP and CBFV. In this Bayesian framework, we solve our model for a physiologically plausible range of candidate ICPs and time offsets to form an ICP likelihood distribution. We combine this distribution with a preset multi-modal prior belief about the patient's ICP, and select the resulting posterior distribution's mode as the baseline ICP. Subsequent changes in the ICP are computed with a uniform prior belief to reduce dependence on the initial prior distribution. The estimated ICP changes are filtered via predictions obtained from the AR model of ICP dynamics for increased robustness.",

Our group has previously proposed a Windkessel-like model that relates cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), the difference between cABP and ICP, with cerebral blood flow, and hence CBFV. This model represents cerebrovascular blood flow resistance and vascular and brain tissue compliance with a variable resistor, R, and capacitor, C, respectively. The model, however, does not describe temporal evolution of the ICP; it is used to estimate mean ICP for each window of ABP and CBFV data segments.",
                        "Here, we have used a time-varying, first-order FIR filter approximation of our previous model with the addition of an AR process description of ICP dynamics. A first-order approximation was chosen because cABP and CBFV are quasi-periodic signals, and their spectral content is concentrated around a few frequency harmonics, limiting the order of models whose parameters can be reliably estimated using only the cABP and CBFV. As shown in the Methods section, the FIR filter coefficients are functions of R and C, and are assumed to remain constant during estimation windows comprising twenty cardiac cycles. This is because modulations in R and C are assumed to occur over longer timescales. Likewise, ICP is also considered to be a constant during an estimation window. The resulting model is shown in FIG. 20, and can be mathematically described as",

For model stability |\u03b3m|<1 is chosen. A value of |\u03b3m| close to +1 models the tendency of ICP to rise or fall rapidly, whereas a negative \u03b3m models static ICPs that only vary slightly about their baseline.

In practice, however, cABP recordings are not available in clinical settings, and thus we use rABP instead. The human blood pressure profile changes along the arterial tree due to reflections from arterial branching sites and vessel taper. There is also a physiologically induced time delay between rABP and cABP due to finite wave propagation velocities. These together can introduce errors in the estimated nICPs. Hence, we developed a probabilistic estimation framework to reduce sensitivity of our nICP estimates on these factors.",
                        "In our method, we first establish a baseline ICP and subsequently track changes in this baseline. The baseline is determined by fitting the model to measured rABP and CBFV for a range of physiologically plausible ICP values and time offsets between rABP and CBFV. The fitting is achieved a least-squared-error sense. The residual errors are then transformed into a likelihood distribution of ICP values. This likelihood is combined with a preset prior distribution. The mode of the resulting a posteriori distribution is taken as the nICP estimate. This procedure is repeated for several windows, and the nICP estimates are averaged together to yield the baseline. The prior distribution employed in this stage generously models ICP values encountered at the bedside\u2014extremely high and low values are given significant weight\u2014in order to ensure our method's generalizability. The distribution is shown in FIG. 21, and its construction process is outlined in detail in the Methods section.",
                        "After this initial baseline estimation stage, ICP estimates are computed with a uniform distribution to reduce dependence on the initial prior belief. A downside of using a uniform distribution, however, is that the resulting nICP estimates are more error-prone than before. In our method, we addressed this problem by filtering changes in estimated nICPs by model-predicted ICP changes via a Kalman filter-like approach, and subsequently adding the filtered ICP changes back to the baseline.",

The data collection protocols were approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards at BCH and MIT, and informed consent was obtained from patients or their surrogates prior to data collection. Individual recording sessions lasted for nearly twenty minutes during which the rABP, CBFV, and (invasive) ICP waveforms were recorded simultaneously. Important metadata including height differences between the location of ICP and rABP transducers were also recorded. Data were collected from thirteen patients suffering from diverse pathologies that included TBI, hydrocephalus, and hemorrhagic strokes of various types. We tested our method's performance on noise-free data segments (Table 1) extracted from the ensemble data. As illustrated in FIG. 22, the extracted rABP and CBFV signals were passed through a signal conditioning stage. The conditioned data were then passed to the estimation routine that computed nICP estimates in non-overlapping twenty-cardiac-beat windows. The nICP estimates were then compared with the reference ICP measurements.",

The following results were computed by setting \u03b3m=0.8, with \u03c3m2=49 mmHg2 in Equation 2 to model rapidly changing ICPs. These parameters help ensure our method's generalizability to diverse datasets, and were determined during a pilot exploration on data subsets from three patients.",
                        "Examples of the estimation results are shown in FIGS. 23A, 23B, and 23C. The first recording is from a stroke patient (Patient 1). The nICP estimation bias in this case was 0.0 mmHg with an RMSE of 1.1 mmHg. The second recording is from another stroke patient (Patient 3). The estimation bias in this case was \u22121.4 mmHg with an RMSE of 4.7 mmHg. In this case, CSF was being actively drained, and the ICP pulsatility was small. The third recording is from a patient suffering from cerebrohepatopathy (Patient 11). The estimation bias in this case was 0.5 mmHg with an RMSE of 2.0 mmHg. These recordings indicate that our method generated nICP estimates that were within clinically acceptable accuracy compared to standard invasive methods, and that it can function in both closed-, and open-drain scenarios, in patients with different pathologies.",
                        "We performed a Bland-Altman analysis to quantify the overall performance of our method. The analysis was performed on a per-estimation-window and per-recording basis (FIGS. 24A and 24B). These analyses indicate that our method achieved an error of 0.6 mmHg and RMSE of 4.2 mmHg in the ensemble data with limits of agreement (bias \u00b11.96 standard deviation (SD)) of \u22127.5 and 8.7 mmHg, respectively. Likewise, the comparison on a per-recording basis revealed an estimation bias and RMSE of 0.5 and 3.5 mmHg, respectively, with limits of agreement at \u22126.4 and 7.3 mmHg. Finally, the per-patient estimation performance is summarized in FIG. 25. These results together indicate that our estimates are well within clinically desired tolerances.",

This analysis is illustrated in FIG. 26 and indicates that nearly 80% of all our nICP estimates were within \u00b15 mmHg of the invasive reference ICP measurements, indicating a strong agreement between invasive reference and noninvasive estimates.",

                        "It is important to analyze the accuracy of invasive ICP measurement modalities in order to put our performance metrics of an estimation bias of 0.6 mmHg and RMSE of 4.2 mmHg in perspective. Invasive ICP monitoring modalities include clinical gold-standard external ventricular drainage (EVD) systems, and integrated (micro-transducer) sensing devices such as the Camino or Codman sensors. Performance analyses of such micro-transducers have been reported in the literature. For example, a cohort of fifteen patients, the Codman sensor had an ensemble bias of 0.3 mmHg with limits of agreement of \u22126.7 and 7.1 mmHg, relative to EVD measurements. That our system approaches these performance characteristics is therefore a positive indicator.",
                        "Radial arterial blood pressure measurement was the only (minimally) invasive aspect of our approach and was used simply because these measurements are readily available at the bedside. The risk of infection from arterial catheters is reported to be far less than that associated with EVDs infection rates of 5% and 10% have been previously reported in EVDs. For instances, some report infection rates of 1.5% in femoral arterial lines with 1.94 times greater risk of infection at femoral sites compared to radial sites. Also, noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitors can pave the path towards fully noninvasive ICP estimation.",
                        "Previous work first proposed the continuous-time ICP model, and also developed an associated nICP estimation routine. They reported an ensemble bias of 1.6 mmHg with an SDE of 7.6 mmHg in data from TBI patients with significant reference ICP variability. They also averaged the nICP estimates obtained from CBFV signals recorded simultaneously from left and right middle cerebral arteries, and reported that this averaging resulted in a reduced SDE of 5.9 mmHg. They were, however, unable to account for the hydrostatic pressure offset between rABP and ICP measurements as they did not have access to the height differences between the ICP and rABP pressure transducers. Also, their data were recorded solely from adult TBI patients, and thus, they did not gauge their method's performance on a wider range of pathologies.",
                        "There are several challenges in adopting model-based nICP estimation approaches in clinical practice. The rABP, for example, might not always be a faithful surrogate for the cABP owing to changes in the arterial blood pressure profile, and this may affect the nICP estimation accuracy. Likewise, the CBFV waveform cannot often be recorded from the same cerebral blood vessel, and morphological differences between CBFV signals recorded from different vessels may alter the resulting nICP estimates. Physiologically induced time delays between the rABP and CBFV signals also contribute to estimation errors. Some have investigated the time offset problem while retaining the same underlying model. In their approach, they first bandpass filter the rABP and CBFV levels to suppress their respective mean levels, before estimating nICP estimates for a range of time offsets. They analyze the resulting R and C estimates to select the final nICP estimate. On a three-patient database, the authors reported an estimation bias and SDE of \u22121.1 and 5.6 mmHg, respectively.",
                        "Our method differs from both these prior methods in several aspects. We accounted for height differences between the pressure transducers, while not employing any mean suppression of rABP and CBFV signals in our approach. Our method includes a strategy to encounter unknown physiologically-induced time offsets between rABP and CBFV signals. Additionally, we have introduced a simple AR model of ICP dynamics that helps in tracking ICPs over long recording durations without overly relying on the prior distribution employed in the initial stage of the method. Our method generates a probability distribution of ICP values, that can be used to determine estimation-confidence metrics, a feature not provided by the other methods. We tested our method on patients with diverse pathologies. Unlike prior methods, we did not have access to simultaneous bilateral CBFV recordings, and thus our method might achieve better performance characteristics in such scenarios.",
                        "An attractive feature of our approach is that it retains its interpretability due to the underlying physiologic model. Several possible time offsets between the rABP and CBFV are considered, which helps address the challenge posed by unknown (and patient-specific) time offsets between these signals. Estimation is performed within a Bayesian framework, which helps increase the method's resilience to structured errors that may be introduced, for instance by differences between rABP and cABP morphology, and also to unstructured errors due to signal noise and motion artifacts in recorded data. An encouraging aspect of our approach is that it achieved an RMSE of nearly 4 mmHg with parameter choices that are applicable to diverse patient populations. Specifically, our prior distribution for baseline estimation spanned negative ICPs, as well as high ICPs. Also, we set \u03b3m close to +1, with a correspondingly large \u03c3m2 for generalizability to data with large ICP variability.",
                        "The nICP estimation method proposed in this paper does not require calibration to invasive ICP measurements. Our system can thus be used as a screening tool for identifying patients suffering from elevated ICP without resorting to invasive and painful procedures such as lumbar punctures. In addition to monitoring patients suffering from neurological diseases, our system can be useful in monitoring intra-operative cerebral perfusion and autoregulation. Both inadequate and excessive cerebral perfusion has been shown to be a cause of post-operative delirium. Surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) typically do not employ concurrent invasive ICP monitoring, and thus cerebral perfusion pressure cannot be directly measured. Cerebral perfusion pressure derived from our nICP estimates can be potentially used to ameliorate this problem.",
                        "Such clinical translation of our method will require implementing it for real-time operation. This is a straightforward prospect because the method employs a set of deterministic causal mathematical operations. Another possible future course of exploration can be to noninvasively estimate ICP pulsatility. While the mean ICP is clinically most relevant, ICP pulsatility has also been proposed to be an important clinical indicator. Additional work may focus on testing our proposed method on a larger dataset comprising subjects with more diverse pathologies, age and gender. We have used routinely measured rABP recordings for estimating ICPs in our clinical dataset, and future validation of the method could also involve noninvasive blood pressure monitors. Work may also focus on harnessing information in the estimated model coefficients, \u03b1m and \u03b2m, both for monitoring a subject's cerebral autoregulation status, and for assessing nICP estimation confidence on a window-by-window basis. Our model incorporates an AR description of temporal evolution of the ICP. Similar descriptions for \u03b1m and \u03b2m can be developed and integrated into our model, albeit at the cost of increasing computational complexity of the resulting ICP estimation algorithm. In the present work, we used preset values of the hyper-parameters \u03b3m and \u03c3m2 in our ICP prediction model. While these preset values were shown to function well across our data, work can focus on automatically and robustly identifying these parameters from longitudinal nICP estimates.",

First, a coarse time alignment step was applied between the rABP and the CBFV signals to account for time delays introduced by different measurement devices. This time offset was obtained by computing the cross-correlation between the rABP and the CBFV signals, and the lag with the highest cross-correlation coefficient was selected as the desired offset. Doing so, however, did not account for physiologically-induced time offsets between rABP and CBFV. Following this time offset correction step, the signals were resampled to a common 125 Hz to compensate for any underlying sampling frequency discrepancies. Finally, the baseline rABP was adjusted to account for differences in ICP and rABP transducer heights. We then passed the signals through an out-of-band-noise removal stage. The rABP and CBFV trends were first extracted via a 256-tap moving-average filter. These trends were subtracted from the rABP and CBFV signals, respectively, and the resulting detrended signals were filtered by a 128-tap bandpass filter with cutoffs at 0.5 and 16 Hz. The trend removed in the first stage was then added back to the filter output to restore the original DC levels. We then assigned an in-band-noise, ag to individual non-overlapping, twenty-beat data windows.
