    "abstract": "Objective: A noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) estimation method is proposed that incorporates a model-based approach within a probabilistic framework to mitigate the effects of data and modeling uncertainties. Methods: A first-order model of the cerebral vasculature relates measured arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) to ICP. The model is driven by the ABP waveform and is solved for a range of mean ICP values to predict the CBFV waveform. The resulting errors between measured and predicted CBFV are transformed into likelihoods for each candidate ICP in two steps. First, a baseline ICP estimate is established over five data windows of 20 beats by combining the likelihoods with a prior distribution of the ICP to yield an a posteriori distribution whose median is taken as the baseline ICP estimate. A single-state model of cerebral autoregulatory dynamics is then employed in subsequent data windows to track changes in the baseline by combining ICP estimates obtained with a uniform prior belief and model-predicted ICP. For each data window, the estimated model parameters are also used to determine the ICP pulse pressure. Results: On a dataset of thirteen pediatric patients with a variety of pathological conditions requiring invasive ICP monitoring, the method yielded for mean ICP estimation a bias (mean error) of 0.6 mmHg and a root-mean-squared error of 3.7 mmHg. Conclusion: These performance characteristics are well within the acceptable range for clinical decision making. Significance: The method proposed here constitutes a significant step towards robust, continuous, patient-specific noninvasive ICP determination.",

                "We model the CBFV waveform as the output of a two-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter whose input is the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) -the difference between cABP and ICP (Fig. 1). We neglect pulsatility in the ICP waveform, thus simplifying our task to estimating the filter taps (or model parameters) and the mean ICP value using measured rABP and CBFV. To do so, we subtract a range of physiologically plausible mean ICP values from the rABP signals to generate a set of CPP waveforms. We then obtain estimates of the FIR filter taps for each CPP waveform by minimizing the associated CBFV prediction error in a least-square error sense. This is done for a range of time offsets between the CBFV and CPP signals. The CBFV prediction errors obtained for each candidate CPP and time offset pair are then transformed into a likelihood distribution of ICP values. Point estimates of this likelihood distribution (such as the mean or median) may then be taken as the final nICP estimates.",
                "We employ this scheme in a two-stage process to increase the nICP estimation accuracy (Fig. 1). First, we establish a baseline nICP estimate and subsequently track changes in this value. To set the baseline, we combine the likelihood distribution with a preset prior belief of ICP values, and take the median of the resulting a posteriori distribution as the nICP estimate. This procedure is repeated for several data windows, and the nICP estimates are averaged together to yield the baseline. We employed a prior distribution that generously models ICP values encountered at the bedside -extremely high and low values are given significant weight -in order to ensure our method's generalizability.",
                "After this initial baseline estimation stage, subsequent nICP estimates are computed with a uniform distribution to reduce dependence on the initial prior belief. A downside of using a uniform distribution, however, is that the resulting nICP estimates are more prone to deviate from measured values. In our method, we addressed this problem by filtering changes in estimated nICP by model-predicted ICP changes via a Kalman filter-like approach [28], and subsequently adding the filtered nICP changes back to the baseline. We first describe our model of cerebral hemodynamics, before describing the associated estimation and tracking method."

Individual recording sessions typically lasted for nearly twenty minutes during which the rABP, CBFV, and (invasive) ICP waveforms were recorded simultaneously. Important metadata, including height differences between the location of ICP and rABP transducers, were also recorded. Data were included from thirteen patients (4 females, 9 males, aged between 2-25 years with a median age of 11 years) who presented with different pathologies including TBI, hydrocephalus, and hemorrhagic strokes with ICP values ranging from 1 to 25 mmHg. The patient information is further summarized in Table I. We tested our method's performance on clean data segments extracted from the ensemble data. Details of the segment extraction process are presented elsewhere [25]. Briefly, CBFV and rABP waveform quality was assessed, and segments of noisy data were removed before applying a coarse time-alignment step between the rABP and the CBFV signals to account -on average -for time delays introduced by different measurement devices. This was done by computing the cross-correlation between rABP and CBFV signals, and selecting the lag with the highest cross-correlation coefficient as the desired offset. The signals were then resampled to a common 125 Hz to compensate for any underlying sampling frequency discrepancies. Finally, the baseline rABP was adjusted to account for differences in ICP and rABP transducer heights as suggested previously in [24].",

In contrast, infection rates of 5% [8] and 10% [9] have been previously reported in EVDs. Thus, our approach has a potentially lower risk of infection than invasive ICP measurement methods.

                        "Features of our approach -Our proposed method yields accurate and patient-specific nICP estimates by combining a simple model of cerebral hemodynamics with an easily interpretable prior distribution of ICP values in a realtime, computationally straightforward manner. Doing so obviates the need to employ sophisticated multi-parameter models that describe complex cerebrovascular behaviors [41], [42] whose parameters are difficult to identify in a simple, noninvasive, robust, and patient-specific manner. Likewise, our proposed approach bypasses the need to resort to statistical learning frameworks that require rich datasets across a multitude of clinical conditions for robust training.",
                        "The proposed estimation framework differs from classical Bayesian system identification approaches that utilize iterative Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (see [43], [44]) and that may therefore not be feasible for real-time computation. Moreover, our prediction model allows for a simple method to fuse predicted and observed ICP changes. More sophisticated prediction models may be used. Increasing the complexity, however, may come at the cost of more computationally involved fusion methods.",
                        "We employed a prior distribution that only coarsely represents the ICP values in our dataset (see Fig. 14). Notably, we assigned greater probabilities to ICP values both below 5 mmHg and above 30 mmHg than the actual proportion of such values in our data. That our approach still achieved an RMSE below 4 mmHg is therefore highly encouraging. To us, this indicates that our method can potentially yield comparable accuracy to invasive measurements when some prior information about subjects' ICP ranges can be provided to the system. The system's performance in absence of prior information does not degrade significantly, as is indicated by the results achieved with a uniform prior distribution. This points towards the method's applicability to cases where no a priori information may be available about patients' ICP values.",
                        "At present, we have employed a simplistic model of temporal ICP evolution. Filtering our ICP change estimates using predictions from this model yielded improved performance, whilst simultaneously relieving dependence on the initial prior distribution. The reduced dependence on the initial prior information will be important in monitoring subjects' ICP over long durations, and through large swings of ICP, as indicated by Fig. 12.",
                        "Kashif et al. [23] previously proposed the two-element continuous-time ICP model used here, and also developed an associated nICP estimation scheme. The authors reported an ensemble bias of 1.6 mmHg with an SDE of 7.6 mmHg in data from TBI patients with significant underlying ICP variability. They also averaged the nICP estimates obtained from CBFV signals recorded simultaneously from left and right middle cerebral arteries, and reported that this averaging resulted in a reduced SDE of 5.9 mmHg. They were, however, unable to account for the hydrostatic pressure offset between rABP and ICP measurements as they analyzed archived data and did not have access to the height differences between the ICP and rABP pressure transducers. Also, their data were recorded solely from adult TBI patients. Building on this work, Fanelli et al. [25] introduced an automated signal quality assessment stage in the model-based estimation scheme of Kashif et al. and automated all pre-processing steps, including time-alignment of the ABP and CBFV waveforms. Their method, however, still remained sensitive to temporal alignment of the input waveforms. They collected data from a heterogeneous pediatric patient population and reported nICP estimation bias and RMSE of 1.0 mmHg and 5.2 mmHg, respectively.",
                        "Our method differs from these prior approaches in several aspects. Sensitivity to time alignment is overcome by forming a likelihood distribution over several time offsets. Our method includes a strategy to take prior information about a subject's ICP into account whilst retaining the interpretability and computational simplicity afforded by the Kashif model. We incorporate temporal evolution of the mean ICP via our tracking framework -a facility not afforded by the previous work. While we did not have access to simultaneous bilateral CBFV recordings, our method might achieve better performance characteristics in such scenarios if averaging similar to that used by Kashif et al. were applied. We demonstrate that estimates of the mean ICP can be obtained with accuracies approaching those of gold-standard invasive methods. Moreover, our proposed method also determines the ICP pulse pressures noninvasively, in a training-free manner -a feature not previously developed in the prior work.",
                        "Contributions -The contributions of this present work include developing a model-based nICP estimation framework that encounters unknown physiologically-induced time offsets between rABP and CBFV signals. An attractive feature of our approach is that it retains its interpretability due to the underlying physiologic model -a facility not provided by pure statistical learning approaches to nICP estimation. Additionally, we have introduced a simple AR model of ICP dynamics that helps in tracking ICPs over long recording durations without overly relying on the prior distribution employed in the initial stage of the method. For each data window, our method generates a probability distribution of ICP values, that can potentially be used to determine estimation-confidence metrics. We demonstrate that the likelihood distribution can also be used to determine estimates of the ICP pulse pressure in a patient-specific manner. Our system does not require calibration to invasive ICP measurements. It can thus be used as a screening tool for identifying patients suffering from elevated ICP without resorting to invasive procedures such as lumbar punctures.",
                        "In addition to monitoring patients suffering from neurological diseases, our approach can also be useful in monitoring intraoperative cerebral perfusion and autoregulation, for example. Both inadequate and excessive cerebral perfusion during surgical procedures has been shown to be a cause of post-operative delirium [45]. Surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting typically do not employ concurrent invasive ICP monitoring, and thus CPP cannot be directly measured. CPP derived from our nICP estimates can potentially be used to ameliorate this problem. Such clinical translation of our method will require implementing it for real-time operation. This is a feasible prospect because the method employs a set of deterministic, causal mathematical operations.",
                        "Limitations and future work -At present, we used a preset prior distribution. However, in a clinical scenario, physicians could be allowed to modify the distribution at the bedside using their insight. Additional work may focus on testing our proposed method on a larger dataset comprising subjects with additional pathologies and larger variations and transient changes in ICP. We have used routinely measured rABP recordings for estimating ICPs in our clinical dataset, and future validation of the method could also involve noninvasive blood pressure monitors. Work may also focus on harnessing information in the estimated model coefficients, \u03b1 m and \u03b2 m , or equivalently R m and C m , both for monitoring a subject's cerebral autoregulation status, and for assessing nICP estimation confidence on a window-by-window basis."

                        "Continuous nICP estimation can benefit a large number of patients that have traditionally been excluded from ICP monitoring due to the current invasiveness of the measurement. The nICP estimation framework proposed in this paper attempts to overcome challenges associated with model-based nICP estimation methods. Several possible time offsets between the rABP and CBFV are considered, which helps address the challenge posed by unknown (and patient-specific) time offsets between these signals. Estimation is performed within a Bayesian framework, which helps increase the method's resilience to structured errors that may be introduced, for instance, by differences between rABP and cABP morphology, and also to unstructured errors due to signal noise and motion artifacts in recorded data. Moreover, ICP pulse pressure amplitudes are determined in a patient-specific manner. It is hoped that this work will pave the way towards developing a reliable, continuous, realtime, accurate, and fully noninvasive ICP monitoring device to improve neurocritical care across the world."
