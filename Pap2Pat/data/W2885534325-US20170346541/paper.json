    "abstract": "We introduce and investigate the opportunities of multi-antenna communication schemes whose training and feedback stages are interleaved and mutually interacting. Specifically, unlike the traditional schemes, where the transmitter first trains all of its antennas at once and then receives a single feedback message, we consider a scenario, where the transmitter instead trains its antennas one by one and receives feedback information immediately after training each one of its antennas. The feedback message may ask the transmitter to train another antenna; or, it may terminate the feedback/training phase and provide the quantized codeword (e.g., a beamforming vector) to be utilized for data transmission. As a specific application, we consider a multiple-input single-output system with $t$ transmit antennas, a short-term power constraint $P$ , and target data rate $rho $ . We show that for any $t$ , the same outage probability as a system with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state information can be achieved with a feedback rate of $R_{1}$ bits per channel state and via training $R_{2}$ transmit antennas on average, where $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are independent of t , and depend only on $rho $ and $P$ . In addition, we design variable-rate quantizers for channel coefficients to further minimize the feedback rate of our scheme.",

In a massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, having CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) is especially This work was supported in part by the NSF Award ECCS-1611575.

A typical way to acquire CSIT is channel estimation followed by (digital) feedback.",
                "Channel training/estimation and feedback are traditionally viewed as two non-interleaving processes, as shown in Fig. 1. According to this traditional viewpoint, for each channel state, the transmitter first trains all of its antennas at once, so that the receiver acquires the entire CSI (or, in general, an erroneous version thereof.). This initial training phase is followed by the receiver feeding back a possibly-quantized version of the CSI. The receiver's feedback is then utilized at the transmitter side for data transmission (e.g., as a quantized beamforming vector.).",
                "Designing such limited feedback systems is a fundamental problem of communication theory and has been the subject of many publications [2]. In particular, limited feedback beamforming [3] has been studied through several different approaches that utilize Grassmannian line packings [4], vector quantization [5], combinations with orthogonal [6] or quasi-orthogonal [7] space-time codes, variable-length coding [8], or other systematic constructions [9]. Conditions to achieve full diversity in a finite feedback scheme has been discussed in [10], [11]. Various distributed limited feedback schemes [12]- [16] provide generalizations to multi-user networks. The conventional scheme in Fig. 1 appears to be infeasible in the case of a massive MISO system. Even the channel training/estimation phase, by itself, would be very challenging to realize due to the large number of transmit antennas that need to be trained. Moreover, even if one assumes that the training stage somehow comes with no cost, feeding back the associated large number of channel values to the transmitter appears to be infeasible. Conventional limited feedback schemes also do not provide much hope in this context: The feedback rates required for even the simplest of the limited feedback schemes such as antenna selection grow without bound as the number of transmit antennas grows to infinity. In [17], it is analyzed in detail how many antennas per user terminal are needed to achieve some percentage of the ultimate performance limit with infinitely many antennas.",
                "There has been some work on channel estimation and CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems; a survey can be found in [18]. In particular, [19] proposes a noncoherent trellis-coded quantization scheme, whose encoding complexity scales linearly with the number of antennas.",
                "In [20]- [22], compressive sensing techniques are utilized to reduce the feedback overhead of the CSI estimation. In addition, several studies [23]- [26] have demonstrated that channel or antenna correlation can be exploited to reduce the overhead of the downlink training phase. A multi-beam selection scheme for massive MIMO is presented in [27]. The problem of designing training sequences with low overheads have been studied in [28]. There are also several other approaches proposed for resolving the challenges of training and limited feedback in the more general context of multi-user MIMO; see e.g., [29]- [32].",
                "Our proposed solution is to interleave the training and feedback stages as shown in Fig. 2.",
                "Unlike the conventional scheme in Fig. 1, the transmitter trains its antennas one by one and receives feedback information after training each one of its antennas. A feedback message may ask the transmitter to train another antenna (and also provide side information about the channel state), or it may result in the termination of the training phase, in which case it also provides the quantized codeword to be utilized by the transmitter for data transmission. An interleaved scheme offers the following unique opportunity: If the already-trained antennas provide sufficiently favorable conditions for data transmission, one can then terminate the training phase and thus avoid wasting more resources on training the rest of the antennas. One main message of this paper is that in certain scenarios, we can make use of this opportunity to design multi-antenna communication systems whose feedback and training overheads remain completely independent of the number of transmit antennas, and which, at the same time, can achieve the same outage performance as a system with perfect transmitter and receiver CSI. Specifically, we consider here a single-user point-to-point MISO system with the outage probability performance measure. Note that, while the \"mainstream\" use case of a massive transmitter antenna array is to support multiple users, a single-user system suffering from severe path loss may also greatly benefit from beamforming over a large number of antennas. Extensions to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, or to multi-user scenarios with different performance measures (such as ergodic capacity) will thus be left as future work. In fact, after the publication of a preliminary version of this work [1], another paper [33] has studied the benefits of interleaving in hybrid single-user and multiple-user massive MIMO systems. The work [33] also considers a general channel model that can incorporate channel correlations. On the other hand, [33] ignores the feedback overhead of the interleaved scheme: It is assumed that the trained channel gains can be perfectly fed back to the transmitter, which requires an infinite number of feedback bits in practice. In contrast, we design interleaved schemes to minimize the training overhead as well as the feedback rate. In more detail, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:",

The feedback message may ask the transmitter to train another antenna or provide the quantized codeword to be utilized for data transmission. The latter event occurs if the already trained antennas can provide enough channel gain to avoid outage.",
                "\u2022 We apply the interleaving scheme to a MISO system with t transmit antennas, a short-term power constraint P , and target data rate \u03c1. We show that our scheme is able to achieve the same outage probability as a system with perfect transmitter and receiver CSI while keeping the average feedback rate and the average number of training antennas independent of t and dependent only on P and \u03c1.",
                "\u2022 We design a variable-rate quantizer to minimize the feedback rate in the MISO system while keeping the same outage probability as a full-CSI system. It is achieved by allocating a higher rate to a larger coefficient in a given channel state.

Examples include video streaming for teleconferencing. In these so-called block-fading scenarios, averaging out a data codeword over infinitely many channel states is not feasible. The appropriate performance metric is the outage probability, which is the probability that the system will not be able to support a given target data rate [34], [35].

We assume that both the transmitter and the receiver agree upon a common transmission rate and power before any training or feedback communication takes place. This ensures that both terminals have perfect knowledge of \u03b1.

In contrast, in this work, we are primarily interested in the t-asymptotic behavior of outage probabilities for a fixed \u03b1, i.e., the behavior of the system for a massive number of antennas.

The good news is that for a full-CSI system, one can transmit with an arbitrarily large data rate (by choosing a sufficiently large \u03b1) with a fixed power consumption P and zero outage as t \u2192 \u221e. The bad news is that it is not always possible to do the same in an open-loop system: When \u03b1 \u2265 1, the outage probability does not decay to 0 with increasing t, and in fact, it saturates to a certain non-zero value. Also, for 0 < \u03b1 < 1, even though we have out(G) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e, there is still room for improvement: As t increases, the outage probability of a full-CSI system decays much faster than that of an open-loop system.",

A more practical approach is to settle for quantized CSIT via finite-rate receiver feedback [3]. Another issue that is common to both a full-CSI and an open-loop system is the requirement of perfect CSIR, which may, by itself, not be feasible when t is large. In the following, we thus consider the design of partial CSIT, partial CSIR schemes that interleave the training and feedback processes as shown in Fig. 2."

As such, while we use Scheme S to represent the general structure of our beamforming scheme, when the details of training, feedback, transmission and decoding are defined, i.e., a specific scheme is defined in details as done in Section III-B, we will use a specific name for the specific scheme. The two important figures of merit of Scheme S is its training length tl(S) and its feedback rate fr(S), which can be defined in the same manner as we have done in Section III-B.",

In a related direction, Theorem 1 shows the existence of a \"good\" scheme that can achieve a vanishing outage probability as t \u2192 \u221e with t-independent feedback and training lengths. One fundamental question that immediately comes to mind is then to determine whether one can achieve the ultimate limit out(F) with again t-independent training length and feedback rate.

Typically, the bitallocation problem is to minimize the overall distortion under some constraint on the total bit rate while the proposed rate-allocation problem is to minimize the total bit rate under some constraint on the overall distortion. As a result, the generalized Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (BFOS) algorithm [43] can be utilized to solve our rate-allocation problem. We design Algorithm 1, based on the generalized BFOS algorithm in [43], to find the optimal rate-allocation to quantize a beamforming vector. The main idea behind the algorithm is as follows. At each step of the algorithm, we assign additional \u2206 bits to the beamforming vector component that results in the maximum distortion reduction among all possible vector components. This will result in an increase of \u2206 bits to the total quantization rate and a reduction in the total distortion, i.e., an increase in the array gain. After updating the rate and distortion of the chosen component, we continue the iterations until the overall distortion satisfies the constraint D a \u2265 \u03b1 or the total quantization rate is greater than that of the fixed-rate deadzone quantizer."

We consider the deadzone quantizer q( -\u2192 h; \u2113) and the deadzone quantizer with rate-allocation q v ( -\u2192 h; \u2113). The average feedback rate is calculated as the feedback rate divided by the number of transmit antennas. We set \u2206 = 1 in the rate-allocation algorithm.

                                "quantizers can achieve the same outage probability as the full-CSI system. Fig. 8 also shows that the outage probability of the interleaving scheme is better than the outage probabilities of the antenna selection schemes, which is further better than the outage probability of random vector quantization [44] with 2 quantization bits per antenna. A smaller outage threshold \u03b1 leads to a lower outage probability. Fig. 9 exhibits several important features: First, the feedback rate with interleaving saturates as t increases. Second, the variable-rate deadzone quantizer q v reduces the total feedback rate compared to the fixed-rate deadzone quantizer q. Third, for the interleaving scheme, the feedback rate decreases as \u03b1 decreases. This is because a lower resolution for the beamforming vector is acceptable if the outage threshold decreases. According to Fig. 10, as the number of transmit antennas t increases, the average feedback rate increases when t is small and deceases when t is large. It is shown that the average feedback rates per antenna for both quantizers are approximately equal to or less than 2 bits/antenna when t is large.",
                                "According to Figs. 9 and 10, the feedback rates of both deadzone quantizers saturate as the number of transmit antennas increases. This is a key difference compared to the conventional CSI quantization techniques for massive MIMO systems. For example, using the method proposed in [19], the receiver sends back a binary feedback sequence of length Bt + q where B is the number of quantization bits used per transmit antenna and q is a small positive constant, which scales linearly with the number of transmit antennas. As a result, compared to the conventional CSI quantizers, the proposed deadzone quantizers can save a large amount of feedback overhead when the number of transmit antennas is large.",

We can observe that the analytical results match with the simulations in all cases. In Fig. 11, the outage probability decreases with K since the SNR threshold \u03b2 is a decreasing function of K, and out(B \u2032 ) decreases as \u03b2 decreases. expected, as the per-stage cost \u01eb increases, the outage probability increases. Also, according to Fig. 12, as K increases from 1 to 30, the training decreases at first but then increases. The optimal value of K that minimizes the training length is 2 for \u01eb = 0.01 and 3 for \u01eb = 0.02. According to Fig. 13, the optimal value of K that minimizes the feedback rate is 3 for \u01eb = 0.01 and 6 for \u01eb = 0.02.",

We applied the interleaving scheme to MISO systems to achieve the same outage probability as the full-CSI system using partial CSIT and partial CSIR. We designed a deadzone quantizer and a rate-allocation algorithm to the feedback messages by a limited number of feedback bits. With t transmit antennas, the interleaving scheme with the deadzone quantizer can achieve a t-independent finite feedback rate which only depends on the power constraint and the target data rate. In addition, the rateallocation algorithm can further reduce the feedback rate by assigning distinct quantization rates to different components in a beamforming vector.",
