                                "The performance of a wireless communication system can be greatly improved by making the channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter and the receiver. In wireless communications, channel state information (CSI) refers to known channel properties of a communication link. This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of, for example, scattering, fading, and power decay with distance. The CSI makes it possible to adapt transmissions to current channel conditions, which is crucial for achieving reliable communication with high data rates in multi-antenna systems. In a massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, having CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) is especially desirable as one can then fully exploit the performance gains promised by the large number of transmitter antennas via CSI-adaptive transmission strategies such as beamforming. A typical way to acquire CSIT is channel training followed by (digital) feedback.",
                                "Training and feedback are traditionally viewed as two non-interleaving processes, as shown in prior art FIG. 1. According to this traditional viewpoint, for each channel state, the transmitter first trains all of its antennas at once, so that the receiver acquires the entire CSI (or, in general, an erroneous version thereof.). This initial training phase is followed by the receiver feeding back a possibly-quantized version of the CSI. The receiver's feedback is then utilized at the transmitter side for data transmission (e.g., as a quantized beamforming vector.). Designing such limited feedback systems is a fundamental problem of communication theory and has been the subject of many publications and at least one survey.",
                                "The conventional scheme in prior art shown FIG. 1 appears to be infeasible in the case of a massive MISO system. Even the training phase, by itself, would be very challenging to realize due to the large number of transmitter antennas that need to be trained. Moreover, even if one assumes that the training stage somehow comes with no cost, feeding back the associated large number of channel values to the transmitter appears to be infeasible. Conventional limited feedback schemes also do not provide much hope in this context: The feedback rates required for even the simplest of the limited feedback schemes, such as antenna selection, theoretically grow without bound as the number of transmitter antennas grow to infinity."

We assume that h\u2248CN(It), where It is intensity of the transmitted signal and CN(.) is the circularly-symmetric complex normal distribution. The transmitted symbol s\u03b5Ct and the received symbol y\u03b5C have the input-output relationship y=sT \u221aPh+\u03b7, where P is the short-term power constraint of the transmitter, and the noise term \u03b7\u02dcCN(1) is independent of h.",

With perfect channel state information at the receiver, CSIR, the channel capacity under this strategy is log2 (1+h\u2020KhP) bits/sec/Hz. For a given target data transmission rate \u03c1=log2(1+\u03b1P), where \u03b1>0 can be chosen arbitrarily, an outage event occurs if log2(1+h\u2020KhP)<\u03c1, or equivalently if h\u2020Kh<\u03b1. We refer to one special case where K=xx\u2020 for some X\u03b5Ct with \u2225x\u2225\u22661 as \u201cbeamforming,\u201d in which case the outage event is x, h2<\u03b1.",
                        "For random h, the transmitter can utilize different covariance matrices for different h. For this purpose, let M: Ct\u2192Ct\u00d7t be an arbitrary mapping, so that given h, the input symbol is distributed as CN([M(h)]T). We define the outage probability with M as out(M)P (h\u2020Mh<\u03b1). We often consider beamforming-only systems, so that for a mapping N: Ct\u2192Ct, we define out(N)P|(N(h), h|2<\u03b1).",

The good news is that for a full-CSI system, one can transmit with an arbitrarily large data rate (by choosing a sufficiently large \u03b1) with a fixed power consumption P and zero outage as t\u2192\u221e. The bad news is that it is not always possible to do the same in an open-loop system: When \u03b1>1, the outage probability does not decay with increasing t, and in fact, it saturates to a certain non-zero value. Also, for 0<\u03b1<1, even though we have out(G)\u21920 as t\u2192\u221e, there is still room for improvement: As t increases, the outage probability of a full-CSI system decays much faster than that of an open-loop system.",
                        "In order to obtain a vanishing outage probability as t\u2192\u221e for every a, one should thus utilize CSIT. The full-CSI system is impractical as it requires an \u201cinfinite\u201d rate of feedback from the receiver to the transmitter. A more practical approach is to settle for quantized CSIT via finite-rate receiver feedback. Another issue that is common to both a full-CSI and an open-loop system is the requirement of perfect CSIR, which may, by itself, not be feasible when t is large. In the following, we thus consider the design of partial CSIT, partial CSIR schemes that are based on the idea of interleaving the training and feedback processes as shown in FIG. 2.",

                        "A well-known partial-CSIT scheme is what we shall refer to as the \u201cconventional\u201d antenna selection scheme: Given h, the transmitter first trains all of its antennas to the receiver so that the receiver acquires the entire CSI. The receiver determines the antenna index arg maxi|hi| with the highest channel gain and sends \u250clog2 t\u2510 feedback bits to the transmitter that can uniquely represent . The transmitter recovers from the feedback bits and transmits over antenna",
                        "This scheme can be characterized by the mapping A(h)\u2296, where ei=[01\u00d7(i-1) 1 01\u00d7(t-1)]T, i=1, . . . , t are the standard basis vectors for Ct. We have out(A)=(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t, which implies \u2200\u03b1>0, limt\u2192\u221eout(A)=0. Hence, for every \u03b1>0, we can obtain a vanishing outage probability as t\u2192\u221e, as desired. Moreover, for any \u03b1 and t, we have out(A)\u2266out(G), and in fact, it can be shown (e.g. by applying Stirling's approximation to (1)) that out(A)o(out(G)), \u2200\u03b1(0, 1). Hence, relative to an open-loop system, antenna selection improves the t-asymptotic behavior of the outage probability for all \u03b1>0. On the other hand, to implement this scheme, one needs to train t scalar channels (one for each hi) and feed back |log2 t| bits for every channel state. Clearly, this is not feasible in the t\u2192\u221e regime.",
                        "B. A New Antenna Selection Scheme",
                        "The conventional antenna selection scheme is excessively precise in the sense that it always tries to select the antenna with the highest gain. On the other hand, without any loss of optimality in terms of the outage probability, we can in fact select any one of the antennas that avoid outage (not necessarily the antenna that provides the highest channel gain) whenever there is one. We use this observation to design an alternate antenna selection scheme that is based on the idea of interleaving training and limited feedback.",
                        "Our new antenna selection scheme operates as shown in FIG. 3. The transmitter first trains the channel h1 corresponding to the first antenna and waits for receiver feedback. The receiver, having acquired the knowledge of h1, sends the one-bit feedback message \u201c1\u201d if |h1|2\u2267\u03b1, i.e. if selecting the first antenna avoids outage. Otherwise, it feeds back a \u201c0,\u201d which indicates that selecting the first antenna will result in an outage. Now, if the transmitter receives a \u201c1,\u201d the training and feedback process can end; the transmitter starts data transmission over the first antenna only (without the need of training the remaining antennas) and outage is avoided. Otherwise, if the transmitter receives a \u201c0,\u201d it proceeds to training the channel state h2 corresponding to its second antenna. The process continues in the same manner until an antenna (selection vector) that avoids outage is found. If all the antennas result in an outage, then the transmitter can simply transmit over an arbitrary antenna.",
                        "Clearly, the new scheme achieves the same outage probability (1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t as the conventional scheme discussed above. Let us now define and calculate its training and feedback overheads. Note that the transmitter trains a different number of antennas for different channel states. Therefore, we define the \u201ctraining rate\u201d of the scheme (measured in antennas per channel state) as the expected number of antennas that the transmitter needs to train, where the expectation is over all the channel states. Also, the receiver feeds back a different number of feedback bits for different channel states, so that we may define the \u201cfeedback rate\u201d of the scheme (measured in bits per channel state) as the number of receiver feedback bits averaged over all the channel states. Now, given 1\u2266i\u2266t\u22121, the transmitter trains only the first i antennas with probability e\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)i-1, and it trains all the t antennas with probability e\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t\u22121+(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t. The training rate is thus: \u03a3i=1tie\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t-1+t(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t=e\u03b1(1\u2212(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t).",
                        "A similar calculation reveals that the feedback rate of the new scheme is actually (numerically) equal to its training rate. Hence, the training and the feedback rates of the new scheme are both given by the formula e\u03b1 (1\u2212(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t). Note that for any t, the two rates are both upper bounded by e\u03b1, which is independent of t.",
                        "The significance of the new scheme is that it provides a vanishing outage probability as t\u2192\u221e with t-independent training and feedback rates. One can thus obtain the benefits of having infinitely many antennas with finite training and feedback overheads. For example, setting \u03b1=1, we can observe that if the transmitter has infinitely many antennas, then for any given power constraint P, we can transmit with rate log(1+P) bits/sec/Hz outage-free via training only e<3 antennas and feeding back 3 bits on average.",

All of these scenarios can in fact be viewed as manifestations of a single unifying framework of a scheme, which describes the rules of how the tasks of training and feedback are to be performed. The advantage of this viewpoint is that it will allow us to more meaningfully compare the different scenarios with respect to their outage probabilities and training/feedback rates.",

A scheme S also describes which antennas are to be trained in which order, the corresponding feedback messages of the receiver, and how these messages are decoded at the transmitter. An example of these \u201cinner workings\u201d of a scheme can be found above for the special case of our new antenna selection scheme. The two important figures of merit of S is its training rate tr(S) and its feedback rate fr(S), which can be defined in the same manner as we have done above.",

These extend the previous definitions in a consistent manner. Also, regarding the new antenna selection scheme described above, we have proved the following theorem: Theorem 1 There is a scheme B with out(B)=out(A)=(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t and tr(B)=fr(B)=e\u03b1(1\u2212(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1)t)<e\u03b1.",

One fundamental question that immediately comes to mind is then to determine whether one can achieve the ultimate limit out(F) with again t-independent training and feedback rates. The answer is yes, and the construction of such a scheme will be provided next. Meanwhile, we note that even though antenna selection provides a reasonable performance, we still have out(F)\u03b5o(out(A)) as t\u2192\u221e.

Regarding the training rates, note that scheme B terminates only if the most-recently trained antenna avoids outage. On the other hand, scheme D terminates whenever the joint contribution of all trained antennas avoids outage. Therefore, for every channel state, scheme D always terminates before scheme B does, and thus, in fact, tr(D)\u2266tr(B).

In other words, by using interleaving, one can also achieve \u201cthe MIMO effect\u201d from a M ISO system with a very large number of antennas. The price to pay however is a training rate of O(Pm) and a feedback rate of O(P3m), which are both much larger than the data transmission rate m log P. Ideally, we would like the feedback and training rates in Theorem 2 (or in another scheme with a t\u2192\u221e vanishing outage probability) to be O(log \u03b1) as \u03b1\u2192\u221e.",

For example, for P=1, increasing \u03b1 from 1 to 3 doubles the data rate. For such scenarios with small \u03b1, tighter bounds on the training and feedback rates and/or custom-made numerically-designed interleaved schemes are a necessity. In this context, finding an efficient scheme for the numerical design of interleaved schemes would prove to be a challenging network vector quantization problem, where one has to design several interdependent vector quantizers managing the multiple feedback phases of the interleaved scheme.",
