                        "2. Discussion of Related Art",
                        "Head coverings must protect from a range of potential contaminates that may present in a variety of forms: airborne gas or vapors, or aerosol dusts, sprays, mists, smokes, and fumes, or bulk liquid. Health care workers (HCW) treating Ebola, for example, must protect themselves from aerosols that might carry the virus as well as macro splatter or larger volumes of liquids that carry heavy concentrations of the virus. In the most recent Ebola epidemic, HCW elected to use hoods with a separate mask because it was not feasible to use a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), and the fluid protection granted by the surgical mask was assumed to be sufficient to protect from the Ebola virus.",
                        "Hoods that leave the face exposed can be used to protect industrial workers from bulk contamination of chemicals or other material that should not contact the skin. These hoods are paired with other devices such as goggles, full face masks, or face shields to protect the face. As was evident in the response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic mixing and matching multiple products to cover the head can often leave the most sensitive area of the body, the face (eyes, nose, mouth, mucus membranes, etc.) vulnerable to contamination. In use, such as with Ebola, this can lead to the infection of HCW.",
                        "Currently, there are two main types of head coverings, or hoods, for personal protective equipment (PPE): 1) head coverings that leave the face exposed, 2) head coverings with integrated face shields that enclose the entire head. Face exposed hoods: Coveralls have an integrated hood that covers the back of the head and lower chin but leaves the face exposed. Standalone hoods also cover the rear of the head but leave the face exposed. If being worn for protection from external contaminants, these hoods require the use of a full face mask, respirator, goggles and/or face shield. Integrated face shield hoods: Fully enclosed suits have an integrated hood with an integrated face shield that fully encloses the head. Similar standalone hoods fully enclose the head and include an integrated face shield. These devices drape loosely over the head. They require an air supply, usually in the form of a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) to filter incoming air, control levels of carbon dioxide within the hood, and manage fogging of the face shield. The air is either supplied to the inside of the hood or to a full face mask worn underneath the hood.",
                        "In the fight against Ebola and countless other medical or industrial applications, a hood is needed that protects the user from exposure without requiring the use of a PAPR."

FIG. 1C shows an embodiment of a headset with a large, clear face shield 124 a visible face mask behind the face shield 126 an inhalation valve positioned on the left side of the respiratory mask 130 and an exhalation valve on the respiratory mask 128.",
                        "In some embodiments, the hood body of the unpowered respiratory protective headset above defines the air outlet, and the air outlet does not obstruct a face of said subject when said headset is worn. In other embodiments, the transparent face shield of the headset defines the air outlet, and the air outlet does not obstruct a face of said subject when said headset is worn.",
                        "In some embodiments, the air outlet does not obstruct a face of said subject when said headset is worn.",
                        "In some embodiments of the invention, the face shield is about 8-11 inches in height and about 12-22 inches in length. Also, the face shield allows for between 180-270 degrees range of vision.",
                        "FIG. 2A shows a transparent respiratory mask 200 according to an embodiment of the invention. The transparent respiratory mask 200 comprises a flexible mask body 202 having an interface section and defining a mask air inlet 204 and a mask air outlet 208.

An inhalation valve 206 is disposed in the mask air inlet 204 and an exhalation valve 210 is disposed in the mask air outlet 208. In some embodiments, the inhalation valve is a one-way valve and the exhalation valve is a check valve. FIG. 2B shows a respiratory mask with a thin foam strip 212 to stiffen the top flap (nose flap) of the respiratory mask. FIG. 2C and FIG. 2D show alternative views of a transparent respiratory mask.",
                        "In some embodiments, the inhalation valves are constructed to have a semi-rigid form that keeps them from adhering to the surface of the user's head. This form may have a pattern of peaks and troughs arranged so that only a small amount of material can contact the wearer's skin leaving a large surface area available for incoming filtered air to pass through. FIG. 3A is a schematic showing a cross-section of valve material as it integrates with the face mask and impermeable material. In such an embodiment, along the inside of the valve, non-breathable material is used to direct airflow over the mask inner surface. FIG. 3B shows this embodiment when integrated into a headset and body suit. FIG. 3B shows air flow (depicted by the black arrows) directed to enter from air inlet 300. Exhaled air is directed out through a different air outlet 102. These inlets and outlets have a high surface area for air transfer.",
                        "In some embodiments, airflow passes into the space of the hood during inspiration through inlet filters. In some embodiments of the invention, airflow passes into the space of the hood during inspiration through inlet valves. Two oppositely oriented one-way valve systems ensure that air flows into the mask from the hood space, and it flows out through exhalation valves. The mask is a rigid or semi rigid structure with a flexible membrane that creates a seal around the nose and mouth. The flexible membrane allows the mask to fit a variety of face shapes \u201cone size fits all\u201d. Although the mask may come in several sizes to accommodate a very wide range of users. The mask is permanently attached to the face shield. The mask is held securely in place on the face of the user by elastic material integrated into the hood. The elastic pulls the edges of the facemask back, thereby applying pressure on the mask (see FIG. 4, which shows an example of a mask that is permanently attached to a face shield). This elastic may be interrupted by a zipper in the hood such that the mask is not pressed onto the face until the zipper is closed. FIG. 4 shows a headset according to one embodiment of the invention. Upon inhalation, air flow (black arrow) is directed to enter through a waterproof valve 420, then through a mask inhalation valve 422 on the clear respiratory mask 424. Exhaled air is directed out of the respiratory mask through an exhalation valve. Tension at the back of the user's head 426 secures the respiratory mask.",
                        "FIG. 5 shows another embodiment of the respiratory mask. In such an embodiment, the respiratory mask is separate from the hood, and attaches to the face shield during use. In the area of attachment, air is allowed to flow from the respiratory mask out of the hood through an outlet valve in the form of an outlet filter. The respiratory mask has a one-way valve 530 to let inhaled air into the mask. A second one-way valve or check valve 532 directs exhaled air out of the mask. The mask also includes an adjustable band 534 for fitting the mask onto a user's head. Velcro attaches the mask to the hood at the air outlet on the hood 536. Upon inhalation, air flow (black arrow) is directed to enter the headset through a waterproof inlet valve. Exhaled air is directed out of the headset through a waterproof outlet valve.",
                        "In some embodiments, the mask covers only the nose, nose and mouth, or the full face. A face shield is integrated into the mask to protect the face while a shroud is not in place. The shroud may alternatively have a flexible window for visibility rather than a rigid face shield.",
                        "In some embodiments, the one-way valve systems can be separate pieces, similar to what is commonly used in respirators. These pieces may be replaceable. FIG. 6 shows a schematic of one-way valve systems constructed of a multilayer configuration of filter material and impermeable material. In a bilayer system, a permeable layer with several openings is attached to the filter material such that when air flows from the impermeable layer to the filter material, a space is created to allow air to flow readily through the filter material. When air flows from the filter material to the impermeable material without such a space, the filter material lays flat against the impermeable material, reducing the area of filter material that allows air to pass, thus restricting airflow.",
                        "The inhalation and exhalation valve regions can overlap partially or completely. Some include both valves at the base of the respiratory mask leading to the same filter material. Inhalation and exhalation regions are placed in many locations around the hood, can be of any size, and can be made from a wide range of filter materials. Material selection is dependent upon level of protection required, and size dependent upon air resistance of material. The inlet/inhalation and outlet/exhalation regions can be located anywhere on the hood, for example, over the ears so the airflow from inspiration can cool the user, or they can be integrated into the face shield to provide some rigidity.",
                        "Some embodiments include an interlocking mechanism between the respiratory mask and the hood that creates a protected respiratory pathway. Some embodiments include a clear face mask that does not obstruct user's face or limit field of view. Some embodiments include a check valve constructed from bilayer of filter material and impermeable material. Some embodiments include a structured filter material and impermeable material that create directed air valves with high surface area for air transfer. Some embodiments include an isolated exhalation pathway integrated into the face shield without obstructing view of the user's face. Some embodiments include integrated elastic bands that apply tension when a rear zipper is closed but not when the zipper is open. Some embodiments include integrated inlet valves that are located away from the nose and mouth so the lower protective quality of material is not covering high risk areas.",
                        "Some embodiments of the invention include a \u201cShape Memory Face Shield.\u201d FIG. 7 shows a \u201cShape Memory Face Shield.\u201d In such an embodiment a face shield is trained to curl along a horizontal axis [M]. When worn, it curls along the vertical axis [L]. As the hood is doffed, the face shield curls along the horizontal axis away from the body to pull the contaminated edges away from the skin. The curling also encourages the hood to fall forward. The back edge of the hood often contacts the user's head during the doffing process. The curling face mask and a rear seam can eliminate this as a potential source of contamination.",
                        "Some embodiments of the current invention include a user activated curling fabric. FIG. 8 is an illustration of a user activated curling fabric. In such an embodiment, a piece of material that is trained to curl in one direction 800 (e.g. film, plastic sheet, single rib of plastic, etc.) is applied to the surface of a flexible substrate (fabric) 801. A second piece of material the same as the first 802 is applied opposing the force of the first curled piece. When the fabric is put under tension, these two curling supports separate 804, 806. As a result, the flexible substrate takes the shape of the material ribs.",
                        "Some embodiments include a body suit and headset with a desiccant fabric. In such an embodiment, desiccant is laminated between a vapor permeable membrane and a non-permeable membrane. FIG. 9 shows a body suit and headset with a desiccant fabric where vapor is pulled from the body suit interior into desiccant, pulling heat from the semi-permeable side of material. This causes the desiccant to heat up. The heat is transferred to the environment through the non-permeable membrane. When made into a contiguous material, this provides full body cooling to the user in personal protective equipment (PPE) and allows for dry air 900 to enter the headset.",
                        "FIGS. 10A and 10B show a headset with waterproof flaps positioned over the air inlets. FIG. 10A shows a headset with a waterproof flap 1000 made of Tychem/Tyvek.

This shroud prevents air from entering the headset from beneath and makes a barrier between the head and body of a wearer. The inhalation filters have a high surface area for air transfer.",
                        "In some embodiments of the invention, the position of inhale/exhale valves allows for defogging of the face shield and hood as well as offers low resistance breathing. Foam on the respiratory mask stiffens the top of the mask and allows for one-size-fits-all without need for a metal bar. A clear plastic front on the mask allows for others to see the mouth of a wearer and allows for increased recognition of a wearer. In some embodiments, the mask is integrated into the hood, while in other embodiments the mask remains detachable. Inhalation valves on the mask are visible through the hood, making it easier to determine if they get blocked or aren't working. A valve shield prevents face from blocking inlet valves.",
                        "Some embodiments of the invention include a hood with a flat pack one size fits all respiratory mask. In such embodiments, inhale valves are located inside the hood and air is filtered prior to reaching the valves. Exhale valves are located outside the hood and decrease air recycling in the hood. The respiratory mask is sewn into the hood by elastic bands to secure it during donning and doffing. To create a barrier between the head of a wearer and the body, a fabric for the bottom half of the mask prevents air circulation between body and head. Inlet filters are positioned over the ear of a wearer for better hearing ability. A flap over the inlet filter with a lightweight metal strip for shape decreases the risk of fluids reaching the filter. A large clear face shield increases visibility and recognition of wearer.",
                        "In such an embodiment, the flat pack mask includes valves for clean and directed breathing, and is made with clear plastic for visibility. The mask allows for passive cooling and air circulation. Clear plastic allows others to see the wearer's face and the wearer to have a greater range of vision (competing masks limit the bottom 30 to 45 degrees of vision, while the instant embodiment is made with clear plastic on the top and front, allowing the wearer to see with an increased range). The inhale valves are located on the sides of the mask so fresh air flows over the plastic, reducing and clearing any fogging from the previous exhale. The inhale valves are on the sides of the mask and the exhale valve is on the bottom, so that none of the valves block the view of the wearer's mouth. Elastic bands for fixing the mask onto the wearer can go either around the head or around the ears of a wearer. When the bands are around the head, a bottom band that goes around the neck can be sewn into the hood to create a barrier between the head and the body, preventing air from circulating between the two and forcing fresh air to enter the hood with each inhale.",
                        "Having the elastic bands from the respiratory mask sewn into the hood improves ease of doffing, as the hood and respiratory mask are then donned and doffed as one piece. This also helps keep the elastic from slipping and causing the wearer discomfort.",
                        "To prevent fogging of the clear respiratory mask, inhale and exhale valves are incorporated with the clear respiratory mask so that fresh air flows in and exhaled air flows out. The inflow of fresh air clears any fogging that accumulated during the previous exhale. Inhale valves can be placed at edge of clear respiratory mask (away from mouth) and/or opposite each other (on left and right, top and bottom, etc. of mask) to increase area affected by flow.",
                        "In some embodiments, the respiratory mask is made of one piece of flexible, or specially folded, or otherwise conformable material (e.g. 0.01 inch thick polycarbonate material) extending from the front of the respiratory mask to anywhere between the tip of the nose and the base of the eyes, so that it conforms to the nose and cheeks. One piece of flexible, or specially folded, or otherwise conformable material extends from the front of the respiratory mask to below the chin (tyvek or foam in our prototypes), so that it conforms to the bottom of the wearer's face/chin.",
                        "In some embodiments, a compressible material (such as foam) is used over the nose area, under the chin, and/or on any surface that comes in contact with the wearer's skin. The material then compresses over any raised areas (such as the ridge of the nose) and stays expanded over any indented areas (such as the intersection of nose and cheek), so that the respiratory mask conforms to the wearer's unique facial structure. This also creates a seal between the respiratory mask and skin. The respiratory mask creates a seal with the wearer's face.",
                        "In some embodiments, the respiratory mask is made so that it is secured to the face by any number of elastic bands extending from the right to the left side of the respiratory mask and that wraps around the back of the head or neck. The bottom-most band, i.e. the band secured closest to the bottom of the respiratory mask, may be secured into a sleeve that extends and is then secured to the hood. This creates a shroud, extending from the elastic at the back of the head or neck to the circumference of the hood, separating the volume within the hood that surrounds the head from the environment, the body, or elsewhere below the hood, preventing unfiltered or unwanted air from entering under the hood.",
                        "Some embodiments also include a vacuum formed respiratory mask. In such an embodiment, the position of the inhale/exhale valves allows for defogging the respiratory mask and hood. A clear plastic body allows for visibility and identification of wearer. A silicone face seal or inflated face seal ensures a good fit and seal.",
                        "Some embodiments also include a hood with a vacuum formed respiratory mask. In such an embodiment, inhale valves inside hood allow for air filtration prior to reaching valves. Exhale valve outside the hood allow for decreased air recycling in the hood. A respiratory mask is sewn into the hood with elastic bands. To create a barrier between the head of a wearer and the body, a fabric for the bottom half of the respiratory mask prevents air circulation between body and head. Inhalation filters are positioned over the ear of a wearer for better hearing ability. A flap over the inhalation filter with a lightweight metal strip for shape decreases the risk of fluids reaching the filter. A large clear face shield increases visibility and recognition of wearer. Some embodiments of the face shield allow for between 180-270 degree ranges of view.",
                        "Some embodiments include an interlocking mechanism in the form of a clipping mechanism for respiratory mask attachment to the hood. In such an embodiment, the clipping mechanism is an attachment that allows the respiratory mask to easily clip into and out of the hood. This mechanism includes a disk that a one-way valve from the respiratory mask secures into, and a U-shaped holder that is attached to the hood. The disk clips snuggly into the U-shaped holder, creating a firm connection between the hood and mask. The U-shaped holder can be attached to the hood so that the opening to the track along which the valve piece slides is at the bottom. This allows the wearer to doff the hood with the respiratory mask still on their face, as the holder would slide over and off the valve piece.",
                        "FIG. 16A is a picture of the clipping mechanism. FIG. 16A shows a receiving end 1600 configured to allow a disk 1602 to slide in for attachment of the respiratory mask (left panel) and slide out for removal of the respiratory mask (right panel). FIG. 16B shows a top view of the clipping mechanism. In FIG. 16B, the disk 1602 slides into a track 1604 disposed into the receiving end 1600. This clipping mechanism creates a protected respiratory pathway between the mask and hood.",
                        "Alternatively, the U-shaped holder can be attached to the hood so that the opening is at the top. This would allow the wearer to tug at the bottom of the hood to unlock the valve from the holder, then doff the hood while leaving the mask attached.",
                        "Some embodiments include PPE ensemble configurations. Such embodiments include a hoodless coverall with the breakaway seam in the back for suit removal and a zipper in the front for easy donning. Such embodiments can also include a hood with adhesive underneath the front edge so that the suit is applied in two pieces and doffed in a single piece.",
                        "Some embodiments include a personal protective whole-body suit, having a body portion and an unpowered respiratory protective headset connectable to the body portion to prevent infectious agents or contaminated air from entering the whole-body suit and/or headset. The headset has a respiratory mask. The respiratory mask has a flexible mask body having an interface section and defining a mask air inlet and a mask air outlet. The interface section is of a size, shape and material sufficient to form an air-tight seal around a nose and a mouth of a subject when worn. An inhalation valve is disposed in the mask air inlet and an exhalation valve disposed in the mask air outlet. The headset also has a hood having a hood body and a transparent face shield attached to the hood body. The hood is of a sufficient size and shape to be worn entirely over and enclose the subject's head and the respiratory mask while the subject is wearing the respiratory mask within the hood. The hood defines an air inlet and an air outlet spaced apart from the air inlet. The hood further has an inlet filter disposed in the air inlet and an outlet valve disposed in the air outlet. In some embodiments, the hood further has an inlet valve disposed in the air inlet and an outlet valve disposed in the air outlet. The air inlet, the mask air inlet, the mask air outlet and said air outlet are configured relative to each other to direct air flow across an inner surface of the transparent face shield to prevent or reduce fogging of the transparent face shield during inhalation and exhalation by the subject when the unpowered respiratory protective hood is worn. Also, the mask air outlet is attachable to and detachable from the air outlet.",
