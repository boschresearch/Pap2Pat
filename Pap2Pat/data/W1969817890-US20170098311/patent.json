                        "A graph search is attractive for quantitative analysis of volumetric medical images, especially for layered tissues, because a graph search allows globally optimal solutions in low-order polynomial time. However, because the volume data can be represented as nodes in an orthogonal graph in Euclidean space, segmentation may not achieve greater precision than a single unit, or distance between two adjoining nodes, and partial volume effects may be ignored. The present methods and systems involve generating a graph representation in non-Euclidean space, thus allowing non-equidistant spacing between nodes on any dimension, so that subvoxel accurate segmentation becomes possible. If the number of nodes in the graph is unchanged, all the advantages of graph search, including global optimality and computational efficiency remain. The present methods and systems can calculate a deformation field from the volume data, adaptively changing regional node density so that node density varies with the inverse of the expected cost. The present methods and systems are discussed with regards to optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina and 3-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of the artery wall. However, other imaging modalities and tissues/objects can be contemplated. The present methods and systems allow both higher precision tissue measurement from medical volume data acquired with the same hardware and measurement at the same precision with lower resolution more cost-effective imaging equipment. The present methods and systems are readily extensible to higher dimensions.",
                        "Object segmentation can be used in image understanding and object recognition, especially in quantitative analysis of volumetric medical images, general pattern recognition, object segmentation from various imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, ultrasound, laser, radar, and the like. Discussion herein will describe medical images but imaging in other fields using object segmentation are considered. Outside of medical imaging, it can be used in any application where multidimensional data needs to be separated into different surfaces, for example 3D computer vision, seismic imaging, construction, ocean hydrodynamic imaging, LIDAR. Organ tissues can be organized in layers, and to segment the boundaries or surfaces of layered objects, the segmentation problem can be transformed into the problem of computing a minimum closed set in a node-weighted directed graph. If organ tissues are not organized in layers, the organ tissue can be unwrapped into layered structures using image transformation. Every node represents a single voxel and the optimal surface corresponds to the upper envelope of the minimum closed set of nodes (e.g., see FIG. 1). FIG. 1 illustrates an example of graph and surface orientation in layered tissue segmentation. Because volume data is represented as an orthogonal matrix of intensities in Euclidean space, the nodes can be placed in Euclidean space, and the surface segmentation may not achieve greater precision than a single unit, or distance between two adjoining nodes. However, higher segmentation accuracy than a single unit can help in better diagnosis and treatment of disease, and equal segmentation accuracy with lower resolution imaging hardware can help in more cost-effective imaging.",
                        "Graph techniques, a generalization of 2D path-based segmentation, can provide globally optimal solutions with respect to a cost function for surface segmentation in three-dimensional volumes in polynomial time. Graph techniques can allow incorporation of various feasibility constraints and regional information for the simultaneous segmentation of multiple surfaces. Additional terms in the cost function can make it possible to penalize local shape or surface distance changes by learning the expected model during a training process. Unfolding techniques can be used to segment objects with complex shapes, such as knee bone, cartilage, heart, pulmonary airway, vascular trees, retinal lesions and retinal vessels. However, all techniques can use a graph in Euclidean space, thus limiting segmentation precision to a single unit.",
                        "Volumetric medical images can be formed by discretizing into a voxel the continuous intensity function measured by each sensor, thus resulting in partial volume effects. Partial volume effects can contain additional information that can potentially be exploited by graph techniques. However, partial volume effects are ignored when the intensity in voxels is converted into nodes in a graph in Euclidean space. By generalizing graphs to include non-Euclidean space, e.g., allowing non-equidistant spacing between nodes on any dimension, this discarded information (e.g., partial volume effects) can be used, while all the advantages of graph techniques sketched above can be retained, including global optimality and computational efficiency. Such a graph search can be defined as non-Euclidean graph search.",
                        "Specifically, a non-Euclidean deformation can be applied to the graph using a displacement field obtained directly from the volume data. This principle is sketched in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B in a simplified 2D example. The density of nodes thus increases at regions where transitions of image properties are more likely to occur. Overall the complexity of the graph structure in terms of the number of nodes and arcs is unchanged after deformation, so that memory requirements and running time are unchanged except for the computation of the deformation field. Effectively, the deformation field adaptively changes the regional node density so that this is higher in regions where the target surface is expected to pass through, and lower in the remaining region, while retaining the overall node density.",
                        "Graphs in Non-Euclidean space allow surface localization with subvoxel accuracy. For example, FIG. 2A shows a graph 200a in standard Euclidean space that allows a graph search to find the lowest cost path 202a (darkest voxel intensity) with voxel accuracy, compared to the true surface 204. Each square represents a voxel 206 and each sphere represents a node 208 within a node's respective voxel 206. FIG. 2B illustrates a Non-Euclidean graph 200b that allows the true surface 204 to be segmented through the lowest cost path 202b with subvoxel accuracy, after the deformation field (arrows 210) derived from the volume data is applied to each node 208. Note a partial volume effect of the two central voxels 206a and 206b compared to their neighboring voxels, indicating that the actual center of low tissue intensity is below the center of the upper dark voxel 206a, as also indicated by the true surface 204.",
                        "The present disclosure introduces a non-Euclidean graph novel approach, and validates the non-Euclidean graph approach's increased accuracy by comparing accurately segmented high resolution volumetric surfaces, the reference standard, to both the non-Euclidean graph approach as well as to standard graph search segmentation of down-sampled volumes in OCT volumes of the retina and MRI of the carotid vessel wall. The presented methods and systems using a non-Euclidean approach provide superior segmentation accuracy over conventional graph search techniques. As an example, the signed error of region bounded by two coupled terrain-like surfaces in ten OCT scans can be significantly decreased from 0.04\u00b10.44 voxels using conventional graph search to \u22120.01\u00b10.31 voxels using the present methods and systems. The unsigned error can be significantly decreased from 0.36\u00b10.26 voxels to 0.18\u00b10.17 voxels.",
                        "In one aspect, a non-Euclidean graph search can be performed. For example, a Euclidean space graph can be generated. The Euclidian space graph can be a representation of layered tissues, lesions, combinations thereof, and the like. Let I be a given 3D volumetric image with a size of n=X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z. For each (x, y) pair, 0\u2266x<X and 0\u2266y<Y, the voxels with different z-coordinates, that is, the voxel subset {I(x, y, z)|0\u2266z<Z}, forms a voxel-column parallel to the z-axis, denoted by p(x, y). Two voxel-columns are neighboring if their (x, y)-coordinates satisfy some neighborhood condition. For example, under the 4-neighboring setting, the voxel-column p(x, y) is neighboring to the voxel-column q(x\u2032, y\u2032) if |x\u2212x\u2032|+y\u2212y\u2032|=1. Henceforth, a model of the 4-neighboring setting is used; this simple model can be easily extended to other neighborhood conditions. Each of the target terrain-like surfaces can contain one and only one voxel in each column of I (FIG. 1).",
                        "The feasibility of the target surfaces can be governed by the surface smoothness and separation constraints. The surface smoothness constraint can be specified by two smoothness parameters, \u0394x and \u0394y, which define the maximum allowed change in the z-coordinate of a surface along each unit distance change in the x and y dimensions, respectively. If I(x, y, z\u2032) and I(x+1, y, z\u2033) (resp., I(x, y+1, z\u2033)) are two (neighboring) voxels on a feasible surface, then |z\u2032\u2212z\u2033 |\u2266\u0394x (resp., |z\u2032\u2212z\u2033 |\u2266\u0394y).",
                        "In multiple surface detection, the surface separation constraint can specify the minimum and maximum distances along the z-dimension between any pair of the target surfaces of interest. Each voxel I(x, y, z) can have a real-valued cost ci(x, y, z) for each sought surface Si, which is inverse to the likelihood that the voxel is on the surface. For a given integer \u03ba>0, the surface segmentation problem seeks to identify a set of \u03ba surfaces with minimum total cost by summing the costs associated with all voxels on all sought surfaces.",
                        "A standard Euclidean space graph search segmentation approach is explained as follows. The surface segmentation problem in 3D volumetric images I(X, Y, Z) can be formulated as computing a minimum closed set in a node-weighted directed graph. For single surface segmentation (i.e. \u03ba=1), the graph G=(V, E) can comprise a set of nodes V and a set of arcs E connecting pairs of nodes. Every node \u03bd(x, y, z) can be created from exactly one voxel of I(x, y, z). The subset of nodes corresponding to a voxel-column p(x, y) of voxels in I can form a node-column, denoted by Col(p). Arcs connecting two neighboring nodes on the same column are intra-column arcs while those connecting two nodes from neighboring columns are inter-column arcs. The intra-column arcs pointing downward can enforce the constraint that a feasible surface S intersects each voxel-column only once. The inter-column arcs can impose smoothness constraints between neighboring voxel-columns.",
                        "A closed set can be a subset of nodes which have no arcs leaving the set. Each non-empty closed set can uniquely define a feasible surface S in I(X, Y, Z). In order to find a minimum closed set C whose total cost is the summation of costs of all nodes contained in the region bounded by surface S, the weight of each node \u03bd(x, y, z) can be assigned as follows:",

                        "By solving the minimum closed set problem, each node can get a binary label/indicating whether a node is contained in C. The upper envelope of C can correspond exactly to the optimal surface with the same minimum total cost in the original graph.",
                        "For simultaneously segmenting \u03ba interrelated surfaces, a similar graph structure can be duplicated \u03ba times with respect to a particular surface. The costs assigned to each sub-graph reflect whether the data can favor the nodes belonging to that certain surface. Inter-sub-graph arcs can be created to connect two nodes from corresponding columns of different sub-graphs, imposing neighboring surface separation constraints. The total cost can be the summation of the cost in \u03ba sub-graphs.",
