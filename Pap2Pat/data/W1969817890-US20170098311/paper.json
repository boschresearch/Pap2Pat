    "abstract": "Graph search is attractive for the quantitative analysis of volumetric medical images, and especially for layered tissues, because it allows globally optimal solutions in low-order polynomial time. However, because nodes of graphs typically encode evenly distributed voxels of the volume with arcs connecting orthogonally sampled voxels in Euclidean space, segmentation cannot achieve greater precision than a single unit, i.e. the distance between two adjoining nodes, and partial volume effects are ignored. We generalize the graph to non-Euclidean space by allowing non-equidistant spacing between nodes, so that subvoxel accurate segmentation is achievable. Because the number of nodes and edges in the graph remains the same, running time and memory use are similar, while all the advantages of graph search, including global optimality and computational efficiency, are retained. A deformation field calculated from the volume data adaptively changes regional node density so that node density varies with the inverse of the expected cost. We validated our approach using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina and 3-D MR of the arterial wall, and achieved statistically significant increased accuracy. Our approach allows improved accuracy in volume data acquired with the same hardware, and also, preserved accuracy with lower resolution, more cost-effective, image acquisition equipment. The method is not limited to any specific imaging modality and readily extensible to higher dimensions.",

                "Object segmentation has been widely used in image understanding and object recognition for decades [1], especially in quantitative analysis of volumetric medical images [2], [3]. Typically, tissues are organized in layers, and to segment their boundaries or surfaces, the segmentation problem can be transformed into the problem of computing a minimum closed set in a node-weighted directed graph [4], [5]. Every node represents a single voxel, while the graph represents the voxel grid. The optimal surface corresponds to the upper envelope of the minimum closed set of nodes. Because volume data is typically represented as an orthogonal matrix of intensities, the surface segmentation can not achieve greater precision than a single unit, or the distance between two adjoining nodes in the graph.",
                "However, higher segmentation accuracy than unit allows better diagnosis and treatment of disease, and equal segmentation accuracy with lower resolution image acquisition hardware allows more cost-effective imaging.",
                "Graph techniques, a generalization of 2D shortest path-based segmentation [6], [7], provide globally optimal solutions with respect to a cost function for surface segmentation in three-dimensional volumes in polynomial time [5]. They allow incorporation of various feasibility constraints and regional information [8] for simultaneous segmentation of multiple surfaces [9]. Additional terms in the cost function make it possible to penalize local shape or surface distance changes by learning the expected model during a training process [10]. Unfolding techniques were developed to segment objects with complex shapes, such as knee bone and cartilage [11], heart [12], pulmonary airway [2], vascular trees [13], retinal lesions [14] and retinal vessels [15]. However, all techniques use a graph in Euclidean space with nodes corresponding to the center of evenly distributed voxels, thus limiting segmentation precision to a single unit.",
                "Volumetric images are formed by discretizing into voxels the continuous intensity function sampled by sensors, resulting in partial volume effects [16], [17]. Partial volume effects contain additional information that can potentially be exploited by graph techniques. However, they are ignored if the intensity, or a derivative thereof such as a gradient, measured at the center of each voxel, is assigned to nodes as their costs in a graph in Euclidean space. By generalizing the graph to non-Euclidean space, i.e. allow non-equidistant non-orthogonal spacing between nodes on any dimension, this previously ignored information can be used, while all the advantages of graph techniques sketched above are retained, including global optimality and computational efficiency. We define such a graph search as non-Euclidean graph search.",
                "Specifically, we apply a non-Euclidean deformation in constructing the graph using a displacement field obtained directly from the volume data. This principle is sketched in Fig. 1 using a simplified 2D example. The density of nodes thus increases at regions where salient transitions of image properties are more likely to occur, while the displacement of each node is confined to the same voxel. Overall the complexity of the graph structure in terms of the number of nodes and arcs is unchanged, so that memory requirements and running time are unchanged except for the computation of the deformation field. The graph space is deformed in a Euclidean way. However, since we do not define a distance metric between nodes in the graph, we refer to this graph structure as a non-Euclidean graph. Effectively, the deformation field adaptively changes the regional node density so that this is higher in regions where the target boundary is expected to pass through, and lower in the remaining region, while retaining the overall node density.",
                "The purpose of this study is to introduce and describe this novel approach, and validate its increased accuracy by comparing it to conventional graph search segmentation of down-sampled optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes of the retina and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the carotid vessel wall. The non-Euclidean graph approach turns out to have superior segmentation accuracy over conventional graph search. We use downsampled volumes as the input data for these comparative studies, while the accurately segmented high resolution surfaces from the original, higher resolution volumes serve as the reference standard. The approach is general and can be adapted to other imaging modalities as well."

                                "The unsigned thickness errors of both approaches over all  A-scans (()were sorted in ascending order and plotted in Fig. 15 for comparison. Non-Euclidean graph search reduces the percentage of A-scans with an error larger than 0.5 voxel from 27.25% to 3.14% compared to the conventional graph search method."

                        "The algorithm was also applied to identify the vascular wall \u2013 the lumen - intima surface, in 3-D MR image data already described in [5]. Two 3-D volumes with size of  voxels were cylindrically unwrapped at the center of the volume to  voxels. One terrain-like surface was identified using both conventional graph search and non-Euclidean graph search (Fig. 16). The surfaces were then mapped back to original volumes to highlight the cylindrical vascular wall (Fig. 16 (b)). The original volumes were manually annotated by an expert and superimposed in Fig. 16 (b) as reference. The manually traced boundaries were unwrapped and superimposed in Fig. 16 (c). More details were shown with two zoomed-in regions in Fig. 17.",
                        "The manual boundaries may not correspond exactly to the maximum intensity transitions at every location along the vascular wall due to its non-reproducible nature, thus preventing quantitative error measurements. Compared with conventional graph search, the surface identified by non-Euclidean graph search is closer to the manual delineation. Again, because the globally optimal solution is searched for in the new non-Euclidean graph space with each node taking on the minimum cost inside its corresponding voxel, the differences between the two approaches are larger than one voxel at a number of places even though the maximum displacement applied to each node is no more than half voxel."

                "We have generalized three-dimensional graph search to allow search in non-Euclidean graph space, and demonstrated that this results in increased segmentation accuracy, at a subvoxel level, for the surfaces of layered tissues. The graph is initially constructed in Euclidean space and then deformed using a deformation field so that the node density is increased near the expected surfaces, and decreased elsewhere. Because the total number of nodes and edges are unchanged, the memory requirement and running time are not affected, except for the time required to determine the deformation field from the volume data, which is negligible compared to the time spent for graph search. Our approach is agnostic with respect to the calculation of the deformation field, the only requirement is that it aligns node density with the inverse of the expected cost.",
                "All advantages of graph search are thus retained including globally optimal surfaces in the time complexity of computing a single maximum flow [5] in polynomial time, the flexibility of combining various in-region and on-surface costs for simultaneous segmentation of multiple surfaces [9], and the capability of incorporating shape priors as in recent papers by Dufour and Song [8], [10].",
                "We developed multi-scale graph search in order to limit memory requirements and run time required for multiple surface segmentation of large 3D volumes [25]. The non-Euclidean approach introduced here also supports multi-scale framework. At the finest scale subvoxel accuracy is achieved as under a regular framework.",
                "The results on SD-OCT volumes of the retina and the vascular MR images of the vascular wall show that subvoxel precision is achieved and that segmentation accuracy compared to conventional search of the graph in Euclidean space is superior. In the present study, we demonstrated the improvements in accuracy using a non-Euclidean approach, using Optical Coherence Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging based images. We would like to emphasize that our approach is not limited to these two modalities, but instead this approach is, in fact, very general and allows subvoxel accuracy in any multidimensional intensity based image where the intensities are the result of an imaging transform.",
                "To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to construct the graph based on the underlying image content, using a generalized approach that allows non-equidistant representation of voxels on a single axis - hence the use of the term non-Euclidean for our approach. It is general in the sense that given any regular graph structure for segmentation, we can always achieve subvoxel accuracy by deforming that graph to a non-Euclidean one, regardless of imaging modalities or the underlying objects. This approach can be readily extended to higher-dimensional image segmentation, such as example 3D + time.",
                "The advantages of increased, subvoxel accuracy while retaining memory and runtime requirements seem obvious, and allow either more accurate measurements in images obtained with the same image acquisition hardware, as well as, measurements with the same accuracy in images obtained at lower resolution, more cost-effective image acquisition hardware."
