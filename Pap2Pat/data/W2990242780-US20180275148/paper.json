    "abstract": "RBM45 is a multifunctional RNA binding protein (RBP) found in cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). While cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions contain other disease-associated proteins, nuclear RBM45 inclusions are morphologically and biochemically distinct from previously described nuclear inclusion pathology in these diseases. To better understand nuclear RBM45 aggregation and inclusion formation, we evaluated the association of RBM45 with a variety of membraneless nuclear organelles, including nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, and nuclear gems. Under basal conditions, RBM45 is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus and does not localize to a specific nuclear organelle. During cellular stress, however, the nuclear RBM45 distribution undergoes an RNA-binding dependent rearrangement wherein RBM45 coalesces into a small number of nuclear puncta. These puncta contain the nuclear stress body (NSB) markers heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB). During chronic stress, the persistent association of RBM45 with NSBs leads to the formation of large, insoluble nuclear RBM45 inclusions. RBM45 nuclear inclusions persist after stressor removal and NSB disassembly and the inclusions resemble the nuclear RBM45 pathology seen in ALS, FTLD, and AD. We also quantified the cell type- and disease-specific patterns of RBM45 pathology in ALS, FTLD, AD, and non-neurologic disease control subjects. RBM45 nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions are found in neurons and glia in ALS, FTLD, and AD but not in controls. Across diseases, RBM45 nuclear inclusion pathology occurs more frequently than cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusion pathology and exhibits cell type-specific variation. Collectively, our results define new stress-associated functions of RBM45, a mechanism for its nuclear aggregation and inclusion formation, a role for NSBs in the pathogenesis of diseases such as ALS, FTLD, and AD, and further underscore the importance of self-association to both the normal and pathological functions of RBPs in these diseases.",

                "RBM45 is a developmentally regulated RNA binding protein (RBP) that forms nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in neurons and glia in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 proteinopathy (FTLD-TDP), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1,2]. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions have distinct compositions and morphologies. Cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions contain TDP-43 and ubiquitin and exhibit a skein-like or globular morphology. In contrast, nuclear RBM45 inclusions are punctate in appearance and are negative for other disease-linked RBPs, including TDP-43 and FUS [1]. Aside from these unique properties, however, little is known about nuclear RBM45 inclusions. In particular, the mechanisms leading to their formation, their impact on cellular viability, and the cell-type specific patterns of nuclear RBM45 pathology across diseases remain unknown.",
                "To better understand RBM45 inclusion formation, we and others have begun to characterize the normal functions of RBM45. The first efforts to this end focused on identifying functional domains in the RBM45 protein. By virtue of a bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), RBM45 is a predominantly nuclear protein under basal conditions [3][4][5]. Mutation of the RBM45 NLS leads to cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein, with attendant incorporation into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) [4,5]. RBM45 also contains 3 RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that govern its binding to RNA sequences, with a GC-rich sequence preference [4][5][6]. Finally, RBM45 contains a novel \"homo-oligomer assembly\" (HOA) domain, an internal intrinsically disordered region that mediates the ability of RBM45 to self-associate and interact with other RBPs (including TDP-43 and FUS) [4,6,7]. Our studies of the HOA domain demonstrated that cellular RBM45 protein frequently exists in a highmolecular weight, oligomeric conformation, presumably as part of its normal function(s) [4,7]. This type of RBP self-association or oligomerization is often required for or accompanies RBP incorporation into membraneless organelles such as SGs, P-bodies, nucleoli, paraspeckles, and Cajal bodies [8,9]. We also used immunoprecipitation coupled to mass-spectrometry (IP-MS) experiments to identify RBM45-interacting proteins and infer that RBM45 regulates mRNA splicing and spliceosome function in the nucleus [3]. Collectively, our observations that RBM45 self-associates and regulates mRNA processing suggest that the protein may be a component of one or more membraneless nuclear organelles that regulate mRNA splicing and processing, such as nuclear speckles or Cajal bodies.",
                "While self-association of RBPs is critical for membraneless organelle formation and function, this process also contributes to inclusion formation in diseases such as ALS and FTLD [8,[10][11][12][13]. A well-studied example of this phenomenon is the RBP aggregation and inclusions that result from RBP incorporation and entrapment in cytoplasmic SGs [14,15]. SGs are cytoplasmic protein-mRNA complexes that form in response to cellular stress [16,17]. They protect mRNAs from a harmful cellular environment and stall their translation, thus conserving energy and prioritizing translation of stress response-associated proteins (reviewed in [16,17]). TDP-43 and FUS are components of SGs and chronic confinement of these RBPs in SGs results in the formation of insoluble inclusions containing these proteins in a variety of model systems [14,[18][19][20][21]. Likewise, SG marker proteins are found in TDP-43 and FUS-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS and FTLD patients, suggesting that SGs are capable of seeding inclusion formation [19,22]. The presence of low complexity and intrinsically disordered domains in these and other SG-associated RBPs facilitates aggregation and can lead to the formation of several forms of amyloid or amyloidlike structures, including amyloidogenic oligomers and fibrils [23][24][25][26]. This pathological \"maturation\" of RBP assemblies into insoluble aggregates and inclusions removes RBPs from their normal cellular milieu, leading to loss of normal RBP function(s) [27][28][29][30]. We propose that an analogous process occurring in the nucleus contributes to both the normal functions of RBM45 and the formation of the nuclear RBM45 inclusions seen in ALS, FTLD-TDP, and AD.",
                "To test this hypothesis, we explored the association of RBM45 with a variety of membraneless nuclear organelles, including nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, nuclear gems, and nuclear stress bodies (NSBs). We found that RBM45 is recruited to NSBs following exposure to a diverse array of cellular stressors. This association is dependent on the protein's NLS and ability to bind RNA. The persistent association of RBM45 with NSBs is sufficient to promote its aggregation into insoluble inclusions and, unlike NSBs, these complexes do not disassemble, but instead increase in size and number over time. Collectively, our results (1) identify novel functions of RBM45; (2) define a new mechanism by which the stress-associated functions of RBPs contribute to their aggregation and inclusion formation; and (3) provide quantitative measures of the cell type and diseasespecific patterns of RBM45 pathology that occur in ALS, FTLD, and AD."

The RBM45 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). A 3xFLAG tag (DYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK) or 2xHA tag (DYPYDVPDYAGGAAYPYDVPDYA) was appended to the N-terminus of RBM45 to generate the 3xFLAG-or 2xHA-tagged constructs, respectively. In previous experiments, we found that appending tags to the C-terminus of the protein alters its subcellular localization, presumably by interfering with the function of the C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (amino acids 454-472 of 474). Thus, all RBM45 tags were appended to the protein's N-terminus. Domain deletions and mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension PCR [37]. Sequences of RBM45 domain deletion and non-functional NLS mutant constructs were as in Li et al. [4]. For live-cell imaging of RBM45 dynamics during conditions of cellular stress, a Tet-inducible EGFP-RBM45 construct was generated by inserting the EGFP-RBM45 (N-terminal EGFP fusion) into the pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing and the sizes of the expressed proteins confirmed by Western blot."

To prevent carryover of residual soluble protein extract into the insoluble fraction, the resulting pellets were washed once with RIPA buffer, resonicated, recentrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was removed. RIPA-insoluble pellets were then extracted in 1.5 ml urea buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 30 mM Tris, pH 8.5) at room temperature for 20 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min at 22 \u00b0C. The final supernatant was collected as the insoluble, detergent-resistant fraction and its protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

The performance of the measured PSF was assessed by deconvolving additional 10 \u03bcm image stacks of 200 nm fluorescent beads using the measured and theoretical PSFs. Comparisons of the deconvolution result using the different PSFs demonstrated that the measured PSF provided a superior image restoration result compared to a theoretical PSF, as assessed by the size and shape of the deconvolved bead image.

We developed an image analysis pipeline to (1) count the number of cells in an image field, (2) count the number of RBM45 nuclear inclusions in each cell in an image field, and (3) measure the nuclear fluorescence intensity in each fluorescence channel in each cell in each image field. These steps were carried out as follows. To count the number of cells in each image, we created binary images of DAPI-stained nuclei using fixed intensity thresholding. The ImageJ particle analyzer was then used to count the number of DAPI-positive cells in each image. Cell counts were further filtered by excluding possible false-positives on the basis of cell size and shape. To count the number of RBM45 nuclear inclusions, we used the DAPI binary images as an overlay mask to restrict analysis to RBM45 foci in the nuclei of cells. These masked images were then thresholded using the Robust Automatic Threshold plugin [48]. The ImageJ particle analyzer was then used to count the number of RBM45-positive foci in the nucleus with particle sizes restricted to published parameters for the size of nuclear stress bodies [33,49]. Finally, the intensity of each fluorescence channel in each cell nucleus in an image field was measured using the corresponding DAPI binary image as an overlay mask. We applied this image analysis pipeline to cells from our immunocytochemistry experiments, hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells from ALS, FTLD-TDP, AD, and non-neurological disease control tissue sections, and spinal cord motor neurons and glia from ALS and non-neurological disease control tissue sections. For each subject from our human tissue analysis, a total of 8 fields per region (hippocampal dentate gyrus or lumbar spinal cord) were analyzed. Each step in the image analysis pipeline was evaluated by comparing its performance to manual counts of at least 10 independent images, with a requirement of 95% agreement between automated and manual counts across images."

We used established marker proteins for nuclear speckles (SC35), Cajal bodies (coilin), nuclear gems (SMN), cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs; G3BP), and nuclear stress bodies (NSBs; SAFB and HSF1). As shown in Fig. 1a-c, under basal conditions RBM45 is a predominantly nuclear protein with minimal cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Moreover, the protein is diffusely localized throughout the nucleus and does not co-localize with nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, or nuclear gems.",
                                "We next examined whether cellular stress promotes redistribution of RBM45 into stress-induced membraneless organelles. Sodium arsenite (0.5 mM for 1 h) led to robust induction of G3BP-positive cytoplasmic stress granules (Fig. 1d), however, cytoplasmic SGs did not contain RBM45. Instead, sodium arsenite caused the diffusely localized RBM45 to coalesce into nuclear puncta (Fig. 1d). We then used heat shock (42 \u00b0C for 1 h) to induce redistribution of SAFB and HSF1 into NSBs (Fig. 1e). As with sodium arsenite, we found that heat shock led to the formation of nuclear RBM45 puncta and these puncta co-localized with SAFB-and HSF1-positive NSBs (Fig. 1e).",
                                "Because both sodium arsenite and heat shock led to the formation of RBM45-positive NSBs, we asked whether RBM45 incorporation into NSBs is a general response to cellular stress. In addition to sodium arsenite and heat shock (Fig. 1e), we found that other NSBinducing stressors, including nutrient starvation (serum deprivation, Fig. 2b), oxidative stress (400 \u03bcM H 2 O 2 , Fig. 2c), heavy metal stress (30 \u03bcM cadmium sulfate [CdSO 4 ], Fig. 2d), and genotoxic stress (20 \u03bcM mitoxantrone, Fig. 2e) led to the formation of RBM45-positive NSBs. As in our initial experiments, under basal conditions, the distribution of RBM45 was diffuse and nuclear, with no RBM45 puncta or NSBs visible (Fig. 2a). The stress conditions used in these experiments also cause the formation of cytoplasmic SGs [35,[50][51][52][53][54][55]. Because previous reports indicated that RBM45 associates with cytoplasmic SGs [4,5], we also examined whether any of the stressors tested led to the incorporation of RBM45 into SGs. We found that all stressors led to the formation of G3BP-positive SGs, but these did not contain RBM45 (Fig. S1).",
                                "NSBs are protein-RNA complexes that result from stress-induced transcription of pericentromeric heterochromatic satellite III (SatIII) repeats. SatIII transcripts remain in close proximity to their genomic locus and act as scaffolds for NSB assembly by recruiting various NSB RNA binding proteins, including HSF1 and SAFB. NSBs are proposed to result from a redistribution of existing nuclear RBPs, rather than an increase in NSB protein levels. To assess whether cellular stress alters RBM45 protein levels, we performed Western blotting for RBM45 in HEK293 total protein extracts from unstressed HEK293 cells and cells subjected to oxidative or genotoxic stress. Neither stressor increased RBM45, HSF1, or SAFB protein levels in HEK293 cells (p > 0.05; Fig. S2), consistent with existing models of NSB formation [31,49,56,57].",
                                "We examined if RBM45-interacting proteins linked to ALS are recruited to NSBs by virtue of their interactions with RBM45. TDP-43 and FUS physically interact with RBM45 [4], are predominantly nuclear proteins under basal conditions, and have defined roles in the cellular response to stress. We therefore assessed whether TDP-43 or FUS can be incorporated into NSBs during cellular stress. Heat shock did not lead to the incorporation of either TDP-43 or FUS into RBM45-positive NSBs (Fig. S3A). We overexpressed HA-tagged versions of fulllength TDP-43 and FUS and evaluated their effects on NSB formation and their association with NSBs. As in the preceding experiments, we did not observe association of TDP-43 or FUS with NSBs (Fig. S3B). Overexpression of TDP-43, but not FUS, was sufficient to promote NSB formation, consistent with previous studies showing that altered TDP-43 expression induces cellular stress (Fig. S3B) [56,57].",
                                "We also tested whether RBM45 is required for the formation of NSBs using siRNA-based knockdown of RBM45. qPCR experiments established that our RBM45 siRNAs effectively targeted RBM45, resulting in an approximately 70% decrease in transcript abundance (Fig. S4). As a positive control for these experiments, we used siRNAs targeting SatIII, as prior studies demonstrated that SatIII knockdown abrogates NSB formation [40,41]. SatIII siRNAs reduced transcript levels approximately 80% (Fig. S4). Neither the scrambled siRNA nor knockdown of RBM45 prevented the formation of NSBs (Fig. S5A,B, respectively). Consistent with previous findings, knockdown of SatIII transcripts prevented NSB formation and eliminated redistribution of RBM45, SAFB, and HSF1 to nuclear foci during cellular stress (Fig. S5C). Therefore, RBM45 associates with NSBs during conditions of cellular stress, but is not essential for NSB formation."

To identify RBM45 domains required for association with NSBs, we examined the co-localization of NSBs and HA-tagged full-length RBM45, several domain deletion mutant RBM45 constructs, and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-disrupting RBM45 mutant construct following heat shock. In unstressed cells, full-length HAtagged RBM45 exhibited a diffuse nuclear localization and no HSF1-positive NSBs were observed (Fig. 3b). A similar result was observed under basal conditions for all RBM45 deletion constructs tested except the \u0394NLS construct, which was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig. S6). Heat shock led to the incorporation of full-length, wildtype RBM45 in HSF1-positive NSBs (Fig. 3c). Disruption of the C-terminal bipartite NLS of RBM45 led to cytoplasmic sequestration of the protein and this was sufficient to abrogate the association of RBM45 with NSBs (Fig. 3d). Removal of the N-terminal RRM (RRM1) did not alter the association of RBM45 and NSBs (Fig. 3e), nor did removal of the protein's HOA domain (Fig. 3h). In contrast, removal of either RRM2 or RRM3 was sufficient to prevent RBM45 from associating with NSBs (Fig. 3f andg). Our data, therefore, suggests a direct interaction of RBM45 with NSB SatIII transcripts via RRM2 and RRM3, rather than by indirect association with other NSB proteins."

The formation of insoluble RBP inclusions may result from the persistent association of these proteins with cytoplasmic SGs. An analogous process occurring via RBM45 association with NSBs during chronic cellular stress could lead to the formation of RBM45 nuclear inclusions. To understand the effects of acute and chronic stress on the distribution and aggregation of RBM45, we used a variety of cellular stressors at differing concentrations and for varying durations. Following acute and chronic stressor treatments, we performed immunocytochemistry for endogenous RBM45 and NSBs. As in prior experiments, under basal conditions, RBM45 was diffusely localized throughout the nucleus and no NSBs were visible (Fig. 4a). Acute treatment with the genotoxic stressor MTX (5 \u03bcM for 6 h) led to the formation of RBM45-positive NSBs (Fig. 4b). To chronically stress cells with MTX, we tested a range of MTX concentrations (0.5-5 \u03bcM), seeking to find the maximum dose that did not adversely affect cellular viability. Using a dose of 1 \u03bcM MTX for 24 h, we found that chronic stress led to an increase in the size, staining intensity, and number of RBM45 foci in the nucleus of HEK293 cells, suggestive of the formation of RBM45 inclusions (Fig. 4c). These inclusions were no longer positive for NSB marker proteins. We used a similar approach to compare the effects of acute and chronic stress resulting from treatment with the cadmium sulfate (acute -30 \u03bcM, 2 h; chronic -5 \u03bcM, 24 h), and sodium arsenite (acute -1 mM, 1 h; chronic -0.1 mM, 24 h). We found that acute stress lead to the formation of SAFB/RBM45-positive NSBs (Fig. 4d,f). In contrast, chronic stress led to the formation of large, persistent RBM45-positive nuclear inclusions that were negative for NSB marker proteins (Fig. 4e,g).",
                                "NSB formation leads to the concentration of NSB proteins at sites containing SatIII transcripts, with attendant depletion of these proteins from their normal cellular milieu. Although acute cellular stress did not alter NSB protein levels (Fig. S2), we observed that the redistribution of proteins to NSBs led to a decrease in total nuclear NSB protein signal by quantitative immunocytochemistry (by changing from more diffuse to distinct puncta staining). We used this approach to quantify changes in RBM45 and SAFB immunoreactivity during conditions of acute and chronic stress. To visualize changes in RBM45 and SAFB on the same scale, we converted the values for each protein to Z scores. As expected, acute stress by MTX (5 \u03bcM for 6 h), CdSO 4 (30 \u03bcM for 2 h), and sodium arsenite (1 mM for1 hour) all significantly reduced the total nuclear RBM45 signal compared to untreated cells (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -11 for MTX, p < 1 \u00d7 10 -9 for CDSO 4 , and p < 0.01 for sodium arsenite; Fig. S7A). These acute stressors likewise significantly reduced the total nuclear SAFB signal compared to untreated cells (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -8 for MTX, p < 1 \u00d7 10 -9 for CDSO 4 , and p < 1 \u00d7 10 -12 for sodium arsenite; Fig. S7B). By contrast, NSBs dissipated over the course of our chronic stress conditions (1 \u03bcM MTX, 5 \u03bcM CdSO 4 , or 0.1 mM sodium arsenite for 24 h) (Fig. 4c,e,g). We could detect this change as a significant increase in total nuclear SAFB signal for two of our three chronic stress conditions compared to the corresponding acute stressor (p < 0.01 for acute MTX versus chronic MTX and acute sodium arsenite, but p > 0.05 for acute versus chronic CdSO 4 ; Fig. S7B), as well as a non-significant difference between untreated cells and these chronic stress conditions (p > 0.05 for untreated versus chronic MTX and sodium arsenite, but p < 1 \u00d7 10 -4 for untreated versus chronic CdSO 4 ; Fig. S7B). Chronic stress led to the formation of nuclear RBM45 inclusions (Fig. 4c,e,g) and we could detect this change as a significant decrease in total nuclear RBM45 signal in cells in our chronic stress conditions compared to untreated cells (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -9 for untreated versus chronic MTX and p < 0.01 for untreated versus chronic CdSO 4 , and sodium arsenite; Fig. S7A). We also observed that the total nuclear RBM45 signal did not differ between individual acute versus chronic stress conditions, owing to RBM45's confinement in NSBs and nuclear inclusions, respectively (p > 0.05 for acute versus chronic MTX, acute versus chronic CdSO 4 , and acute versus chronic sodium arsenite; Fig. S7A).",
                                "The RBM45 inclusions observed following chronic stress may reflect a change in RBM45 solubility. Because protein overexpression via transient transfection can lead to the formation of protein inclusions independent of cellular stress, we examined the solubility of endogenous RBM45 at physiological expression levels. For these experiments, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to append a 3x FLAG tag to the N-terminus of the endogenous RBM45 gene. We performed extensive characterization of CRISPR-Cas9-edited RBM45 HEK293 cells lines and found a non-significant reduction in RBM45 expression at the RNA level via qPCR in our CRISPR-RBM45 lines compared to unedited control cell lines (p > 0.05; Fig. S8A). We also observed no effects on nuclear morphology (Fig. S8B), no differences in RBM45 subcellular localization (Fig. S8B), or cellular morphology (Fig. S8B), suggesting that our CRISPR-cas9 genome editing and expression of HA-tagged RBM45 did not interfere with cellular physiology or RBM45 function. Soluble and insoluble protein extracts were obtained from FLAG-RBM45 cell lines as outlined in Fig. 5a. The purity of the insoluble extract was determined by blotting for GAPDH, which is not a component of the insoluble protein fraction in stressed or unstressed cells. We used TDP-43, which increases in the insoluble fraction following cellular stress, as a positive control [43]. As shown in Fig. 5b, heat shock or treatment with sodium arsenite led to a significant increase (p < 0.01 for both comparisons) in the amount of insoluble RBM45 (denoted using anti-FLAG tag antibody). For treatment with sodium arsenite, we observed that increasing the stress duration led to increased levels of insoluble RBM45 (p < 0.05). Treatment with sodium arsenite led to a concomitant decrease in the amount of soluble RBM45 protein (p < 0.01), while heat shock did not alter the levels of soluble RBM45 (p > 0.05). A similar pattern was observed for TDP-43, where sodium arsenite stress significantly increased the amount of insoluble TDP-43 compared to unstressed cells (p < 0.01 for both comparisons), while heat shock increased the amount of insoluble TDP-43 (p < 0.01), but did not alter the amount of soluble TDP-43 (p > 0.05).",
                                "To understand the temporal dynamics of RBM45 NSB association and inclusion formation, we used live-cell imaging of HEK293 cells expressing N-terminally GFPtagged RBM45 under the control of the Tet repressor. Addition of 10 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline to the culture medium led to robust expression of EGFP-RBM45. We used livecell imaging to measure the dynamics of RBM45 during cellular stress. In untreated control cells, RBM45 maintained its diffuse nuclear localization for the 24 h duration of the live-cell imaging experiments (Fig. 6a). No RBM45 nuclear inclusions were observed during this period. In contrast, acute treatment with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite led to the formation of RBM45-positive NSBs (Fig. 6b). These foci emerged within 1 h of treatment (arrowheads in Fig. 6b) and were almost completely eliminated 5 h after removal of the stressor (Fig. 6b, T = 6 h panel). At the completion of the experiment, no RBM45-positive NSBs were visible (Fig. 6b, T = 24 h panel). In contrast, chronic treatment with 0.1 mM sodium arsenite for 12 h led to the formation of large nuclear RBM45 inclusions that persisted for the 24-h duration of the experiment (Fig. 6c, T = 12 h and T = 24 h panels). These inclusions were larger, more numerous, and brighter than those observed during acute stress conditions (compare Fig. 6c "

                                "To characterize cell-type specific patterns of RBM45 pathology in ALS, FTLD-TDP, and AD, we quantified RBM45 nuclear and cytoplasmic pathology across these diseases and measured the co-localization of the NSB marker protein SAFB with RBM45 nuclear inclusions. We first performed immunohistochemistry for RBM45, SAFB, and TDP-43 in the dentate gyrus of nonneurological disease controls, FTLD-TDP, ALS, and AD (Fig. 7a-d). We focused our efforts on the dentate gyrus as RBM45 nuclear inclusions are significantly more prevalent in the dentate gyrus than in hippocampal pyramidal neurons [1]. Subject demographics are shown in Table 1. We used an image analysis pipeline to extract the number of cells, the number of RBM45 nuclear inclusions, and SAFB immunoreactivity by confocal microscopy (see Methods). Cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions were counted manually. We counted a total of 8 fields per subject, corresponding to a total of 10,640 cells across all groups. In non-neurologic disease controls, RBM45 exhibited diffuse nuclear and strong perinucleolar immunoreactivity in dentate gyrus granule cells (Fig. 7a,arrowheads). These cells also exhibited strong, diffuse nuclear SAFB immunoreactivity. In contrast, granule cells in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and AD patients typically exhibited multiple RBM45 nuclear inclusions with a corresponding loss of nuclear/perinucleolar RBM45 immunoreactivity (Fig. 7b-d, respectively). RBM45 nuclear inclusions were negative for SAFB, consistent with our in vitro results in chronic stress conditions. Cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions were occasionally observed in dentate gyrus granule cells and were positive for TDP-43 (Fig. 7b-d, bottom panels [arrows]), but negative for SAFB.",
                                "We quantified the number of nuclear and cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions in dentate gyrus granule cells of each subject. The distribution of nuclear inclusions exhibited a strong rightward skew, with many cells containing zero inclusions. Accordingly, we used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test to assess the differences in RBM45 inclusion counts between groups. FTLD-TDP subjects exhibited significantly more RBM45 inclusions than non-neurologic disease controls, AD, or ALS subjects (Fig. 7e; p < 1 \u00d7 10 -6 for control and AD and p < 0.01 for ALS versus FTLD-TDP, respectively). ALS subjects had significantly more nuclear inclusions than control or AD subjects (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -6 and p < 0.01, Fig. 6 Live-cell imaging of RBM45 nuclear stress body (NSB) and nuclear inclusion formation during conditions of cellular stress. HEK293 cells induced to express N-terminal GFP-tagged RBM45 were used to visualize the subcellular distribution of RBM45 during normal conditions and during acute and chronic cellular stress. a In untreated cells, RBM45 is predominantly nuclear and diffusely localized throughout the nucleus. b Treatment with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 1 h causes the formation of numerous RBM45-positive nuclear stress bodies (NSBs; arrowheads). Cells were treated with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite at t = 0 h. Under conditions of acute cellular stress, NSB formation is reversible, most RBM45-positive NSBs have dissipated by t = 6 h, and RBM45 remains diffusely localized throughout the nucleus for the remainder of the experiment. c Chronic cellular stress leads to the entrapment of RBM45 in nuclear inclusions. Cells were treated with 0.1 mM sodium arsenite for 12 h to assess the effect of chronic cellular stress on RBM45 subcellular distribution. Because of the lower concentration of sodium arsenite, the time course of NSB formation is altered. Following removal of sodium arsenite (panel \"Washout\"), RBM45 remains in nuclear inclusions for the remaining 12 h duration of the experiment (arrowheads). For all panels, scale bar = 5 \u03bcm g The relationship between RBM45 nuclear inclusions and SAFB immunoreactivity is shown, along with the regression line. Regardless of disease state, with increasing numbers of RBM45 nuclear inclusions, SAFB immunoreactivity decreases, particularly at \u22653 granules per cell. The relationship between these two variables is statistically significant (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -16 ). In the scatterplot shown, jitter is added to the points to more clearly visualize the data, but the separation between inclusion integer numbers is still seen. The inset image shows an example of adjacent cells in an FTLD-TDP subject where one cell with no RBM45 granules has strong SAFB nuclear immunoreactivity, while the neighboring cell has several nuclear RBM45 inclusions and low SAFB nuclear immunoreactivity. In (a-d), the scale bar = 20 \u03bcm, while in the inset in (g) the scale bar = 5. For all panels, FTLD = FTLD-TDP respectively). Because non-neurologic disease controls had significantly more hippocampal dentate gyrus cells than FTLD-TDP, ALS, or AD subjects, we repeated this comparison after normalizing RBM45 inclusions to the number of cells and found that FTLD-TDP had significantly more nuclear inclusions per cell than ALS, AD, and control subjects (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -6 , p < 1 \u00d7 10 -8 , respectively). ALS subjects had significantly more RBM45 nuclear inclusions than control and AD subjects (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -6 and p < 0.01, respectively). The comparison between AD and non-neurologic disease controls did not reach statistical significance following multiple testing correction (p = 0.015). We observed that cells containing RBM45 nuclear inclusions often had multiple inclusions (in some instances more than 10 per nucleus), irrespective of disease state (Fig. 7f). AD and ALS subjects showed comparable proportions and numbers of inclusions per cell, while the vast majority of cells from control subjects (> 85%) show 1 or fewer nuclear inclusions. The proportion of hippocampal cells containing at least 1 nuclear RBM45 inclusion was significantly greater than the proportion of cells containing at least 1 cytoplasmic inclusion (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -8 ). Cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions were not observed in non-neurologic disease controls. Summary statistics for RBM45 nuclear and cytoplasmic pathology in the dentate gyrus are shown in Table 2.",
                                "In subjects with nuclear RBM45 inclusions, a bimodal pattern of SAFB immunoreactivity was seen wherein cells with multiple RBM45 nuclear inclusions had low SAFB immunoreactivity and cells without RBM45 nuclear inclusions had higher SAFB immunoreactivity. We quantified this relationship (Fig. 7g) and used linear regression to assess its significance. Across all groups, increasing numbers of RBM45 nuclear inclusions per cell were associated with decreasing SAFB immunoreactivity (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -16 ). SAFB nuclear immunoreactivity was lowest when cells had \u22653 RBM45 nuclear inclusions (Fig. 7g,inset).",
                                "We applied the same analysis to lumbar spinal cord tissue sections from ALS and non-neurologic disease controls. In motor neurons from non-neurologic disease control subjects, RBM45 immunoreactivity was largely nucleolar (Fig. 8a, arrowheads) and SAFB and TDP-43 immunoreactivity was diffuse. RBM45, TDP-43, or SAFB nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion pathology was absent in control subjects (Fig. 8a). In contrast, ALS patients frequently exhibited skein-like cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusion pathology that co-localized with TDP-43 but not SAFB (Fig. 8b). We noted a decrease in RBM45 nucleolar immunoreactivity in spinal cord motor neurons containing cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions (Fig. 8b, arrowheads). Despite altered RBM45 motor neuron nucleolar immunoreactivity, we did not detect nuclear RBM45 inclusions in motor neurons of ALS subjects (Fig. 8b, Table 2). Instead, we frequently observed RBM45 nuclear inclusions in adjacent glial cells in ALS, but not in non-neurologic disease controls (Fig. 8b andc [arrows]; Table 2).",
                                "We quantified lumbar spinal cord glial cells and glial nuclear RBM45 inclusions in individual image fields. A total of 3382 lumbar spinal cord glial cells across 26 subjects were counted using this approach. Glial cells in  ALS patients contained significantly more RBM45 nuclear inclusions per cell than those from non-neurologic disease controls (Fig. 8d, p < 1 \u00d7 10 -8 ). While approximately 90% of glial cells in control spinal cord exhibited no RBM45 nuclear inclusions, greater than 50% of ALS glial cells had one or more RBM45 nuclear inclusions (Fig. 8e). The proportion of spinal cord glial cells containing nuclear RBM45 inclusions was significantly greater than the proportion of spinal cord glial cells with cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions (p < 1 \u00d7 10 -4 ; Table 2). Similar to the hippocampus, glial cells that contained multiple RBM45 nuclear inclusions displayed reduced SAFB immunoreactivity (Fig. 8f, inset). We explored the relationship between nuclear RBM45 inclusion number and SAFB immunoreactivity and found that greater numbers of RBM45 inclusions per cell were associated with decreasing SAFB nuclear immunoreactivity (Fig. 8f, p < 1 \u00d7 10 -6 ). SAFB nuclear immunoreactivity was lowest when cells had \u22653 RBM45 nuclear inclusions (Fig. 8f, inset). Summary statistics for the image analysis of human spinal cord tissue are shown in Table 2."

                        "The goals of this study were to further characterize the normal functions of RBM45, define the mechanisms by which RBM45 forms nuclear inclusions, and quantify cell type-specific patterns of RBM45 inclusion pathology in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and AD. We found that RBM45 associates with nuclear stress bodies (NSBs), stressinduced protein-RNA complexes, in response to a diverse array of cellular stressors as part of its normal functions. This association is mediated by the protein's nuclear localization sequence and RNA recognition motifs (RRM) 2 and 3. In addition, the chronic entrapment of RBM45 in NSBs was sufficient to promote nuclear RBM45 inclusion formation, even when other NSB proteins had disassociated from these complexes. In human CNS tissue, nuclear RBM45 inclusions were frequently found in ALS, FTLD-TDP, and AD in distinct cell types and this pathology occurs more frequently than cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions. Nuclear RBM45 inclusions in post-mortem tissue lack NSB marker proteins, consistent with our in vitro models of chronic stress. Aggregation and assembly into membraneless organelles is essential to the normal functions of many RBPs, and aids in regulating transcription, mRNA splicing, transport, and decay [58]. The assembly of RBPs, nucleic acids, and other factors into membraneless organelles acts to compartmentalize these components, leading to a high local concentration of enzymes and substrates of the associated biochemical reactions [58][59][60]. Our prior work demonstrated that RBM45 regulates mRNA processing and forms oligomeric complexes and interacts with other RBPs via an intrinsically disordered region termed the homo-oligomer assembly (HOA) domain [3,4]. We, therefore, sought to determine whether RBM45 associates with an RBP-containing nuclear organelle. To this end, we examined the co-localization of RBM45 and several membraneless, RBP-containing organelles, including nuclear speckles, Cajal bodies, nuclear gems, and NSBs. Under basal conditions RBM45 does not colocalize with any of these organelles and, instead, exhibits a diffuse nuclear localization (Fig. 1). Subsequently, we observed that RBM45 coalesces into nuclear puncta following the onset of cellular stress and these puncta correspond to NSBs (Figs. 1 and2).",
                        "NSBs are protein-RNA complexes that form in response to stress-induced transcription of satellite III (SatIII) repeats from pericentromeric heterochromatin [49]. The resultant SatIII transcripts act as scaffolds that recruit various RBPs to NSBs, notably the transcription factor HSF1 and the hnRNP SAFB, resulting in the appearance of several nuclear granules that disassemble following stressor removal [40,49]. Despite a wellcharacterized mechanism of formation, the functions of NSBs have remained enigmatic. Current theory suggests that NSBs act as one component of a larger gene expression regulatory program in the cellular response to stress [49]. By sequestering various DNA/RNA binding proteins, such as RBM45, SAFB, and HSF1, NSBs are thought to alter gene expression through effects on both transcription and splicing. Aside from this general model, however, little is known about how NSBs alter the function of their constituent proteins during stress. NSBs are specific to primate cells and are not found in other organisms, including rodents [40,49]. Consequently, the role of NSB proteins in the cellular response to stress may exhibit species-specific differences. Further studies are needed to understand the role of NSBs in the cellular response to stress and how incorporation into NSBs alters the gene regulatory functions of RBM45 and other NSB proteins.",
                        "RBPs can be recruited to NSBs by direct binding to SatIII transcripts or indirectly via protein-protein interactions with resident NSB proteins [49]. Our data indicates that recruitment of RBM45 to NSBs requires RNA binding motifs (RRM2 or RRM3) and does not require the HOA domain that mediates protein-protein interactions with other RBPs (Fig. 3). This suggests that RBM45 associates with NSBs via direct RNA binding. Prior studies demonstrated that RBM45 has a binding preference for poly (C) and poly (G) RNA [6]. The SatIII transcripts that act as the scaffolds for NSBs are themselves G-and C-rich [40,41], consistent with our hypothesis that RBM45 incorporation into NSBs is a consequence of direct binding to SatIII transcripts. We observed that RBM45 is not required for the formation of NSBs (Fig. S5). This result is not unexpected given that the mechanism of NSB formation is transcription of SatIII DNA by HSF1 binding rapidly following stress onset [40,49]. NSB formation also exhibits cell-and stressorspecific variability and even HSF1 itself is dispensable for NSB formation during certain types of cellular stress [32]. Thus, the primary function of RBM45 in NSBs appears to be removing the protein from its normal, diffuse nuclear localization, similar to other NSB proteins [49].",
                        "Previous studies reported that RBM45 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules and interacts with stress granule proteins, notably TDP-43 and FUS [4,5]. We examined the distribution of RBM45 during conditions of cellular stress and found no evidence of RBM45 cytoplasmic translocation or association with cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 1d, e and Fig. S1). Several factors may account for the conflicting claims regarding RBM45 and SGs made here and elsewhere. First, previous reports of RBM45 association with SGs were made using plasmidbased overexpression of RBM45 with a mutated, nonfunctional NLS [4,5]. While such approaches establish that RBM45 can associate with SGs, they rely on artificially disrupting the normal subcellular localization of RBM45 and expressing the protein at non-physiological levels. Our study using wild-type RBM45 expression at physiologic levels failed to identify RBM45 association with cytoplasmic SGs under a diverse array of stress conditions (Fig. S1). Consistent with this observation, recent studies to comprehensively characterize the SG proteome failed to detect RBM45 within SGs [55,61].",
                        "After identifying RBM45 as a component of NSBs, we asked whether chronic entrapment of the protein in these structures could seed nuclear RBM45 inclusion formation. RBM45 self-assembles into higher-order oligomers [4] and this behavior is likely essential to one or more of the protein's normal functions, similar to other aggregation-prone RBPs [55,62]. While acute stress results in transient RBM45 association with NSBs, chronic stress was sufficient to convert RBM45 into an insoluble form and irreversibly trap the protein in nuclear inclusions (Figs. 4, 5 and6). Importantly, in the absence of SatIII transcripts, this phenomenon was not observed (Fig. S5), indicating that RBM45 nuclear aggregation and inclusion formation requires the initial formation of RBM45 containing NSBs. We also observed that TDP-43 and FUS are not recruited to NSBs (Fig. S3). This result suggests these proteins are not components of the nuclear RBM45 inclusions we observe in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and AD because they are not recruited to NSBs.",
                        "RBM45 nuclear inclusions that result from chronic stress lack NSB marker proteins, despite initial colocalization in NSBs (Fig. 4). Similarly, we did not observe co-localization of RBM45 and NSB marker proteins in ALS, FTLD, or AD tissue (Figs. 7 and8). Several factors may account for these observations. The HOA domain that mediates RBM45 self-association is an intrinsically disordered peptide segment that promotes the assembly of RBM45 oligomers [4]. Chronic stress likely facilitates this process via compartmentalization in NSBs in a manner analogous to the sequestration and aggregation of TDP-43 and FUS in cytoplasmic SGs. HSF1 and SAFB do not oligomerize into large, macromolecular assemblies as part of their normal functions. HSF1 functions as a DNA binding-competent trimer and is only detectable in NSBs over a limited time course, specifically the early, but not late, phase of NSB lifetime [50]. SAFB likewise functions as a monomer or homodimer, but has not previously been shown to assemble into oligomeric complexes. It too, is detected over a limited time frame in the lifespan of a NSB, appearing approximately 1 h after HSF1 granules are detectable [50]. Despite the fact that RBM45, HSF1, and SAFB are all incorporated into NSBs, no direct physical interaction between these proteins has previously been observed [3]. The physical and temporal separation of these proteins, together with the low aggregation potential of HSF1 and SAFB, provide plausible explanations for the absence of these proteins in RBM45 nuclear inclusions resulting from chronic stress. RBM45 nuclear inclusions may nonetheless contain additional proteins and future studies will characterize the proteome of these structures.",
                        "A consistent finding from our in vitro and human tissue data is that nuclear RBM45 inclusions abrogate the normally diffuse localization of RBM45 protein in the nucleus (Figs. 4, 7, 8, S7). These results raise the possibility that RBM45 inclusions lead to loss of the normal functions of RBM45 by sequestering the protein from its normal sites of activity. RBM45 inclusions could, thus, contribute to cell death in disease via a \"two-hit\" model, wherein inclusions cause both toxic gain and loss of function. Such a model is well-established for other aggregation-prone RBPs in disease, including TDP-43 and FUS [21,63,64]. RBM45 regulates mRNA splicing and processing [3,65] and perturbing these functions may, therefore, have broad effects on gene expression and cellular physiology. Studies of RBM45's role in several biological processes support this prediction, showing that RBM45 regulates mitochondrial function [5], lipid metabolism [65], and the immune response [66]. However, further studies into the RNA targets of RBM45 are needed to more precisely predict how loss of the protein's normal functions influences gene expression and other cellular and organismal phenotypes.",
                        "RBM45 is frequently observed in cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in neurons and glia in FTLD-TDP, ALS, and AD, but not in non-neurologic disease controls [1,2]. To better understand cell type-and disease-specific patterns of RBM45 inclusion pathology in neurodegenerative diseases, we performed an extensive quantification of RBM45 pathology in ALS, FTLD-TDP, AD, and nonneurologic disease controls. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, numerous RBM45 nuclear inclusions with a punctate morphology were observed in FTLD, AD, and ALS subjects, but not in non-neurologic disease controls. When we quantified the number of cells and RBM45 nuclear inclusions in each cell, we found that FTLD subjects had the highest proportion of cells with at least 1 nuclear inclusion and the highest average number of nuclear inclusions per cell. RBM45 nuclear inclusions were negative for TDP-43 or SAFB. Instead, we found that the presence of RBM45 nuclear inclusions correlated with disruption of the normal distribution and immunoreactivity of SAFB in ALS, FTLD, and AD (Figs. 7 and8), similar to our results with chronic CdSO 4 treatment (Fig. S7). Critically, this was not due to a general decrease in SAFB immunoreactivity, as neighboring cells without RBM45 nuclear inclusions showed strong SAFB immunoreactivity comparable to non-neurologic disease controls (Figs. 7g and Figs. 8f, inset). The distribution of RBM45 nuclear inclusions in dentate gyrus granule cells ranged from 0 to 17, with the majority of cells harboring > 5 inclusions found in FTLD subjects. This range of values shows good agreement with previous efforts to quantify the number of NSBs that form in response to different stressors in cultured cells. One study found that individual HeLa cells typically produced 1-20 NSBs in response to a variety of stressors, with 50% of cells harboring 1-5 NSBs [32]. We hypothesize that RBM45 nuclear inclusions in human post-mortem tissues denote the prior generation of NSBs in these cells with subsequent chronic stress. We observed RBM45 nuclear inclusions in some aged non-neurologic disease controls, though this may be due to the normal aging process as seen with other RBPs [67,68].",
                        "We also quantified RBM45 pathology in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS and non-neurologic disease controls. As in our prior study, we found TDP-43-positive RBM45 cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons of ALS but not non-neurologic control subjects (Fig. 8). A key finding from this study is RBM45 nuclear inclusions show cell-type specificity in ALS spinal cord. Specifically, we observed RBM45 nuclear inclusions in ALS glial cells, but not motor neurons. RBM45 exhibits a predominantly nucleolar immunoreactivity in motor neurons in human CNS tissue that was not seen in any other cell type examined (Fig. 8). We hypothesize that the RBM45 nucleolar localization in motor neurons limits the protein's ability to associate with NSBs, and hence, generate nuclear inclusions. Alternatively, spinal cord motor neurons may not form NSBs upon cellular stress. We observed that cytoplasmic sequestration of RBM45 in inclusions is associated with reduced nucleolar RBM45 immunoreactivity (Fig. 8). In contrast to motor neurons, glial cells in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS subjects frequently had RBM45 nuclear inclusions (Fig. 8). Notably, the proportion of glial cells with at least one RBM45 nuclear inclusion was significantly greater than the proportion of glial cells with cytoplasmic RBM45 inclusions (Fig. 8 and Table 2). Similar to our in vitro results and those from the dentate gyrus, we also found that glial SAFB immunoreactivity was reduced in the presence of RBM45 nuclear inclusions. Glial inclusion pathology occurs in various forms of ALS and glial inclusions may contain TDP-43, FUS, SOD1, C9ORF72-associated dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), or other ALS-associated proteins [69,70]. The occurrence of RBM45 inclusions in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of ALS glial cells, together with the diversity of other proteins found in glial inclusions in ALS, underscores the predominant role of glial dysfunction in the pathobiology of ALS and related diseases.",
                        "Overall, our results demonstrate that RBM45 associates with NSBs during cellular stress and that chronic stress leads to persistent self-association of RBM45 and nuclear RBM45 inclusion formation. Nuclear RBM45 inclusions are extensively found in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in ALS, FTLD, and AD, as well as in glial cells in ALS spinal cord. The presence of nuclear inclusions is associated with depletion of RBM45 from its normal subcellular milieu and altered distribution of other RBPs. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the biological functions of RBM45, the mechanisms by which RBM45 forms inclusions, and implicate NSBs in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases.",
                        "numerous RBM45-positive NSBs become visible in the cell nucleus (arrows) and these do not contain TDP-43 or FUS. Some TDP-43-positive stress granules are visible in the cytoplasm following heat shock and these do not contain RBM45. (b) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected to overexpress HA-tagged TDP-43 or FUS and were then stained for the HA tag and the NSB marker HSF1. Overexpression of TDP-43 was sufficient to induce NSB formation, but NSBs were negative for TDP-43. Neither overexpression of FUS or transfection with a control HA vector resulted in NSB formation. For all images, scale bar = 10 \u03bcm."
