    "abstract": "The invention relates to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of neurological diseases. In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods and kits that diagnose whether a subject has a neurological disease or susceptibility to a neurological disease by evaluating nuclear stress body (NSB) levels. Further described are methods and kits that prognose a neurological disease in a subject by monitoring changes in NSB levels. Also described are methods and kits that treat neurological diseases by administering one or more inhibitors of NSB signaling to a patient, as well as compositions containing one or more NSB signaling inhibitors. Medical conditions suitable with various embodiments of the invention include but are not limited to ALS, FTLD, dementia and AD.",

                        "Nuclear stress bodies (NSBs) are a subnuclear structure generated in response to a variety of cellular stressors. Their formation is dependent on the transcription of non-coding Satellite III DNA sequences. Nuclear stress may regulate what genes are expressed in the cell and ultimately contribute to the survival or death of the cell. However, the biological functions of NSBs are not entirely understood. While stress induced events have also been associated with neurological conditions, there is no prior data indicating a role of nuclear stress response in neurological disorders, and there is no knowledge of an RNA binding protein-based nuclear stress response in neurological disorders. NSBs may adversely affect therapeutic interventions, contributing to the challenges in drug development for this class of diseases. Thus, there is a need in the art for an increased understanding of NSBs, as well as the development of novel and effective neurological treatments and therapies in response to cellular stressors."

To investigate the biological functions of RBM45 and the mechanisms of inclusion formation, the inventors performed immunohistochemistry on neurodegenerative disease patient tissue, immunocytochemistry in cultured cells, digital deconvolution, and image analysis. Results showed that RBM45 exhibits a speckled staining pattern in the nucleus of patient tissue that is distinct from cytoplasmic inclusions. Results from immunocytochemistry experiments demonstrate that this pattern corresponds to the incorporation of RBM45 into nuclear stress bodies. Nuclear stress bodies are a subnuclear structure generated in response to a variety of cellular stressors, and their formation is dependent on the transcription of non-coding Satellite III DNA sequences. Examination of post-mortem brain tissue from FTLD and control patients revealed that the number of RBM45-positive puncta in the nucleus of dentate gyrus granule cells was higher than that of control subjects. Collectively, these results identify a component of nuclear stress bodies, link these structures to neurodegenerative disease, provide therapies to reduce or modify nuclear stress response in cells, and describe testing assays to measure nuclear stress and monitor treatment responses, as well as antibodies to nuclear stress response proteins.",

                                "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of adult-onset motor neuron disease. A pathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of inclusions containing RNA binding proteins in neurons and glia. One such protein is the RNA binding motif protein 45 (RBM45). The inventors have identified this protein as a putative CSF biomarker of ALS and showed that RBM45 pathology is a common phenomenon in ALS, FTLD, and AD. To investigate the biological functions of RBM45 and the mechanisms of inclusion formation, the inventors performed immunohistochemistry on neurodegenerative disease patient tissue, immunocytochemistry in cultured cells, digital deconvolution, and image analysis. The inventors' results show that RBM45 exhibits a speckled staining pattern in the nucleus of patient tissue that is distinct from cytoplasmic inclusions. Results from immunocytochemistry experiments demonstrate that this pattern corresponds to the incorporation of RBM45 into nuclear stress bodies. Nuclear stress bodies are a subnuclear structure generated in response to a variety of cellular stressors (FIG. 6). Their formation is dependent on the transcription of non-coding Satellite III DNA sequences. Examination of post-mortem brain tissue from FTLD and control patients revealed that the number of RBM45-positive puncta in the nucleus of dentate gyrus granule cells was higher than that of control subjects. Collectively, these results identify a novel component of nuclear stress bodies and link these structures to neurodegenerative disease."

The number of RBM45-positive puncta in neurons of these tissue sections were counted for quantitative comparison. Other examples of anti-RBM45 antibodies include but are not limited to ab105770 and ab123912 from ABCAM; sc-132421, sc-132422, sc-132423, sc-102076 from SANTA CRUZ BIOTECHNOLOGY; and HPA020448 and AV41154 from SIGMA ALDRICH.",
                                "An imaging-based approach combining immunofluorescence microscopy (IF), digital deconvolution (DD), and automated image analysis (IA) is used to examine RBM45 redistribution and colocalization with markers of subnuclear structures in response to heat shock and mitoxantrone (topoisomerase II inhibitor, genotoxic stress).",
                                "For immunocytochemistry experiments, HEK293 cells were grown and stained with antibodies, as above. Corresponding images were subjected to digital deconvolution, counting as above, and quantitative immunocolocalization with markers of subnuclear structures.",
                                "Digital deconvolution is a mathematical post-processing method that removes out of focus light from wide field fluorescent microscopic images, based on the mathematical modeling of the behavior of light in a given imaging system, called the point spread function (PSF). The effect of deconvolution is similar, in practice, to using a confocal microscope. It does not \u201cthrow away\u201d photons, however. Several deconvolution procedures exist, which vary in complexity/algorithm. The inventors used a filter-based method to remove out of focus light and/or a constrained iterative method that re-assigns light to the point source from which it emanates.",
                                "During image analysis, counts are based on thresholding of image pixel intensity values and counts are made using particle detection algorithms (vary size/circularity). On example of colocalization analysis is quantitative immunocolocalization analysis as described in Li et al., 2004. That is based on the idea that if two proteins are in complex (i.e., colocalized), both their location and pixel intensity values will co-vary together. Steps include: collect 8 bit pixel intensity values from 2 channels of image; remove zero value pixel pairs; log transform pixel intensity values; plot XY scatter of intensity and co-variation; compute ratio of positive value to total pixels; and use non-parametric sign test to test assumption that ratio is different than zero. Results show colocalization of RBM45 and HSF1 in MTX treated cells (p=0.002), in heat shocked cells (p=0.005), in unstressed cells (p>0.05); and colocalization of RBM45 and other subnuclear structure markers (SMN, SC35, and coilin) (p>0.05)."

The distribution of RBM45 changes in response to cellular stress in ways that favor the appearance of RBM45-positive nuclear foci. This pattern is similar to that of HSF1, suggesting the incorporation of RBM45 into NSBs. HSF1 is critical to the formation of NSBs and seems to interact with RBM45. A similar pattern is seen the dentate gyrus of FTLD patients, suggesting that nuclear stress body formation is initiated by the pathological cascade accompanying FTLD and related disorders. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, chronic stress may cause persistent association of RBM45 molecules, which leads to its aggregation in the nucleus. It can be tested using chronic stress (heat shock, MTX, and CdSO4 etc.). Also, it can be examined if nuclear stress body accumulation leads to the formation of inclusions, and, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, this is proposed for cytoplasmic stress granules in these disorders.",
