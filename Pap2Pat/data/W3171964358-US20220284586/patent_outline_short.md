# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- introduce CAD system for pulmonary function assessment

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis
- discuss limitations of current diagnosis methods

## SUMMARY

- introduce novel CAD system for COVID-19 diagnosis

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

- describe CAD system for assessing pulmonary function in patients with Coronaviridae infection

### Data Preprocessing

- preprocess medical image data to improve contrast and identify region of interest

### Rotating, Scale, and Translation Invariant MGRF Model

- construct MGRF model to capture appearance of infected lung regions
- define Gibbs potential functions and estimate them using empirical probability distributions
- calculate Gibbs energy of infected lung region using estimated potentials

### NN-Based Fusion and Diagnostic System

- fuse diagnostic results from multiple Gibbs energy estimates using neural network

### Experimental Results

- validate system using publicly available datasets and evaluate performance using various metrics

## Automation

- automate steps in method using computer or other electronic device

## Discussion and Conclusion

- introduce ARDS and its effects
- motivate need for accurate diagnosis and ventilation management
- describe limitations of current ventilation methods
- propose AI-based solution for diagnosis and prognosis
- summarize embodiments of the present disclosure
