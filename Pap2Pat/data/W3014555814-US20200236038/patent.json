It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.",
                        "Large communication networks, such as T-Mobile's North American network or Microsoft's cloud network, are among the most complex industrial systems to be found anywhere in the world today. Managing these large communication networks efficiently while also satisfying all the demands placed on them is obviously not a trivial problem to solve. Many computer engineers and other technical experts have worked tirelessly to improve these systems so that they will continue to operate as intended while also being able to accommodate the increasingly complicated demands placed on them.",
                        "Computerized control planes are known for various types of communications networks, particularly large communications networks. A control plane comprises the portion of a router architecture that is concerned with drawing the network topology and/or the information in a routing table that defines what to do with incoming data packets. Control planes decide which routes go into a main routing table for unicast routes and into additional routing tables for multicast routes.",
                        "Control planes can be applied to access networks of nearly all types. Control planes offer well-known advantages including, among the others, significant operating expense saving, capital expense savings, and improved traffic restoration. However, the control plane technology provides some challenges as well, such as scalability issues and low control of the network operator on the paths used by the traffic in end-to-end services with consequent lack of resource optimization.",
                        "Prior art solutions for control plane scalability generally focus on aspects such as electronic aggregator-to-processing entity or processing entity-to-electronic aggregator delay reduction, computerized processing entity capacity and utilization optimization, flow setup time and communication overhead minimization. While these efforts in the prior art have been helpful, they have not yet provided an optimal solution for the problems they attempt to solve.",
                        "For large-scale programmable networks, flexible deployment of distributed control planes is essential for service availability and performance. However, the solutions available in the prior art only focus on placing controllers whereas the consequent control traffic is often ignored, leading to numerous drawbacks.",
                        "Similarly, the next generation of networked systems will likely include programmable and virtualized infrastructures. The accelerated development of network programmability and virtualization is a reasonable and expected development, as commodity hardware becomes increasingly cheaper and the demand for elastic cloud services continues to grow. In distributed and networked environments, deployment of virtual instances requires a robust deployment strategy to ensure service reliability and performance, such as bandwidth and flow delay. Here, virtual instances comprise physical hardware that has been configured in a logical (or virtual) configuration to perform as if the composition of physical hardware was an integrated unit. As cloud services become central to the digital transformation in research, industry, and finance, it becomes of increasing importance to consider the service performance within and across geo-distributed data centers. Addressing these challenges is fundamental to elastic services entailing effective resource usage and service performance requirements.",
                        "The ability to flexibly plan and deploy virtualized infrastructures with performance guarantees is relevant to many networked systems that rely on virtual entities requiring reliable data transactions, such as:\n\n\n- - software defined networks (\u201cSDN\u201d) operating using distributed\n    control planes;\n  - network services implemented by virtual network functions (\u201cVNF\u201d);\n    and\n  - cloud computing services running in distributed system\n    architectures.",
                        "Common to these networked systems is the deployment of virtual entities (a virtual machine, a network controller instance or a virtual network function) which implement a service (cloud application, control service or network service). Coupled with digital transformation, there is a drastic increase in services centered around reliable data transactions with performance guarantees on bandwidth and flow delay.",
                        "In particular, flow delay is of growing importance as more services (e.g., Intelligent Transportation Systems (\u201cITS\u201d)) require short response times for close to real-time applications. Similarly, big data computations carried out across geo-distributed data centers may in many cases require guaranteed performance. Accordingly, the way cloud computing tasks have been planned and deployed will impact service performance with respect to how quickly and accurately a cloud computing result can be delivered (some results could get lost due to, e.g., link loss).",
                        "As networks and services grow more complex, automated deployment of virtualized infrastructures becomes essential. Methods and systems enabling automated deployment typically require the capability for taking performance guarantees and reliability requirements into account. Application areas or implementation of improved solutions include control plane deployments, cloud computing, and network function virtualization (\u201cNFV\u201d).",
                        "While network control systems and services have improved in recent years, there nevertheless exists a continuous need to improve the design and operation of network control systems and services, especially where such improvements can be accomplished in a commercially reasonable fashion."

An example for such a large network would be T-Mobile's North American network or Microsoft's cloud network.",

The output comprises a computer-operable and/or computer-implementable deployment strategy (or plan) that can be realized by having additional computing elements (or software in a computing element) initiate processing entities at planned locations along with the data flows following performance guarantees and reliability guarantees. The computer-implementable deployment strategy defines network and/or service control operations in line with calculated performance guarantees. Embodiments of the invention further relate to computerized systems and methods that direct and control the physical adjustments to data transmission paths in a large-scale network's composition of computerized data transmission nodes in order to limit data end-to-end transmission delay in the computerized network to within a calculated worst-case delay bound.",

Evaluating different computerized implementations of the framework over real-world computerized network topologies shows that close to optimal solutions may be achieved. Moreover, experiments using such large-scale network computerized systems indicate that applying a computerized method for controller placement without considering the control traffic, causes excessive bandwidth usage (worst cases varying between 20.1% to 50.1% higher bandwidth) and congestion when compared to various embodiments of the prior art, such as may be found in S.

To ensure resource efficiency, service reliability and guaranteed performance, deployment of distributed control planes (fundamental for scalable management of traffic over physical and virtual data transmission nodes) takes both placement and control traffic properties into account.",

As such, embodiments of the invention can be used for planning a physical computer network with respect to bandwidth, reliability and delay requirements. Similarly, the specific components for directing and controlling such a physical computer network may comprise specialized hardware and other electronic devices that monitor the physical computer network, make physical adjustments to the flow of data through the network, and otherwise direct the operations for such a physical computer network.",
                        "In contrast to the prior art, an embodiment of the optimization process detailed here adds additional steps for quantifying the consequences of deploying a control plane solution that predetermines reliability and bandwidth requirements. As a powerful computerized prediction tool, service providers and operators can use embodiments of the invention to fine-tune control plane deployment policies for application in their systems. In combination with the generic design of the black-box optimization process, many existing computerized methods can be adapted and employed for control plane optimization and service management.",

To improve reliability and scalability, more recent solutions propose a distributed control plane, consisting of multiple physically distributed but logically centralized control instances. Under distributed conditions, both placement and routing of data traffic between processing entities should be considered to avoid a dramatic increase in communication overhead. The prior art in distributed control plane deployment typically ignores control plane traffic routability (e.g. bandwidth constraint and flow delay limitations) and only considers placement optimized for scalability or reliability.",
                                "For example, the prior art in control plane scalability mainly focuses on aspects such as switch-to-computerized processing entity or computerized processing entity-to-computerized processing entity delay reduction, computerized processing entity capacity and utilization optimization, and flow setup time and communication minimization. Prior art examples having reliability models or measurements employ intuitive objective functions to obtain a placement solution, without providing an estimate of the achieved reliability. One prior art solution, for example, proposed a method for estimating the network reliability in polynomial time and provide a lower bound of the actual reliability, along with a heuristic algorithm to decide the number of processing entities and their locations, to guarantee a certain reliability requirement. However, the prior art does not address control traffic routability.",

The placement of virtual machines (\u201cVMs\u201d) having an awareness of network resources and inter-VM traffic demands have been studied in the prior art. One prior art solution proposed VM placement approaches with the considerations on the inter-traffic between VMs, by assuming a very simple model of the underlying network (without network topology and routing considerations). In other prior art, methods for placing a fixed number of VMs with traffic consideration based on networks inside a data center have been proposed. For example, one on-demand VM placement solution in the prior art assumes a simple network model which is insufficient in real network applications",

However, instead of considering all the possible paths set \u03ba when scheduling flows, the CGH algorithm uses certain heuristic to select a small subset of paths \u03ba\u2032\u2286\u03ba. The key of CGH is to split the problem into a master problem and subproblem. The master problem is here the maximum concurrent flow problem but for a subset of the paths \u03ba\u2032\u2286\u03ba. The subproblem based on (20) is created to identify new variables that can improve the objective function of the master problem. The heuristic implemented by CGH is comprises three steps, iterated until no new variables can be found: 1) solving the master problem with a subset of the variables and obtaining the values of the duals; 2) considering the subproblem with the dual values and finding the potential new variable; and, 3) repeating step 1) with the new variables that have been added to the subset. This allows us to optimize flow scheduling only within this subset of paths rather than considering the whole set of the paths.
