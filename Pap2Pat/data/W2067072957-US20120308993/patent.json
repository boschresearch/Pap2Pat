                        "Influenza A is an infectious disease of animals caused by type A strains of the influenza virus that normally infect birds, and less commonly, pigs. There are many subtypes of the influenza A virus. These subtypes are based on the haemagglutinin (HA) segment 4, which has 14 varieties and neuraminidase (NA) segment 6, which has 9 varieties. It is these two segments of the virus that cause virulence.",
                        "For example, influenza A subtype, H1N1, is known to mutate quickly, and has been shown to be highly pathogenic and can cause severe diseases in man. H1N1 has been viewed as a model for rapid genetic evolution and pandemic change. Generally, evolution is explained to be the selection of frequent copy errors generated by a polymerase complex that lacks a copy function. These errors are then selected for an evolutionary advantage, such as evasion of the immune response of the host, which allows the influenza to expand and fix the selected mutation. Also, influenza viruses employ recombination for rapid evolution via homologous recombination. Therefore, mutation in influenza occurs frequently and these variants may include properties such as anti-viral drug resistance, ability to escape from immune recognition and the like. Further, a study on 64 children in the United Kingdom demonstrated a higher rate of drug resistance in H1N1 than H3N2 and influenza B.",
                        "One of the more commonly used anti-viral drugs in the past was oseltamivir. It was used as monotherapy for seasonal H1N1. However, the effectiveness of oseltamivir dropped with the emergence of H1N1 with resistance to oseltamivir. In each reported instance, H1N1 was isolated with the neuraminidase polymorphism, H274Y. This change was expected, because it is located in the active site of the enzyme, and oseltamivir binding requires a conformational change in the active site and H274Y inhibits this change leading to a strain with oseltamivir resistance.",
                        "Seasonal H1N1 viruses with the H275Y mutation became widespread during the 2007-2008 northern hemisphere influenza seasons. In 2007-2008, the H275Y mutation was detected in 64% of influenza A (H1N1) isolates collected from Oceania, South East Asia, and South Africa (Hurt, 2009). Patients infected with the oseltamivir resistant virus were more likely to develop pneumonia or sinusitis than those infected with the wild-type virus. It was widely postulated that the emergence of resistance in seasonal H1N1 was due to the selective pressure of drug therapy and that resistant virus was likely to be less fit for disease transmission. However, resistant seasonal H1N1 rapidly replaced susceptible wild type seasonal H1N1 in the face of a relatively low consumption of oseltamivir in Europe between 2002 and 2007 (Kramarz P et al., 2009).",
                        "More recently, in the 2009 flu pandemic, the new strain of virus, Influenza A (H1N1) 2009, isolated was found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses\u2014North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe. This new strain appears to be a result of reassortment of human influenza and swine influenza viruses, in all four different strains of subtype H1N1.",
                        "The principle mutation (H275Y) associated with oseltamivir resistance in vitro has also been recently reported in at least 39 cases of H1N1 (WHO Pandemic (H1N1) 2009\u2014update 71). The clinical importance of this mutation in this virus is assumed from in vitro data. The worldwide prevalence of this mutation in seasonal H1N1 rapidly increased from being negligible in 2007 to up to 95% as of March 2009 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/h1n1_table/en/index.html).",
                        "Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was first detected in Singapore in May 2009. In an attempt to slow down the spread of the virus affected patients were kept in isolation until the virus could no longer be detected by PCR, which was taken as a surrogate marker of infectivity. Surveillance for the H275Y mutation was systematically performed on samples from new cases.",
                        "The spontaneous emergence of the oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 was not surprising but its dissemination, prevalence, and persistence were unexpected. The real question was whether oseltamivir would fail when used as monotherapy in a life threatening case of influenza with the H275Y mutation. We assumed it would fail for seasonal H1N1 and expect the same for Influenza A (H1N1) 2009. It is therefore of great interest to consider whether resistant mutants of Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 will mirror the global expansion of seasonal H1N1 in 2007-2009 and expand to become the dominant Influenza virus, replacing both the current wild type \u2018susceptible\u2019 H1N1 virus and the normally predominant H3N2 viruses."

                        "With the rapid emergence of new strains of Influenza A viruses with mutations in the genome leading to properties that allow better survival of the virus in the body, early detection and treatment is essential to eradicate the virus. Molecular biology techniques like PCR and RT-PCR may be used for the detection of the virus. However, since the Influenza A viruses are prone to mutations, the sensitivity of the primers used is fundamental. Also, as the emergence of resistant virus is of public health importance, specific and/or sensitive detection method(s) for anti-viral resistant influenza A virus, is essential.",
                        "The severity of disease due to Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 is in general similar to that of seasonal H1N1, with only a small proportion of infections producing severe disease. However, the concern is that there may be huge numbers of influenza due to the immunologically naive younger global population and that with this large denominator the small proportion of severe cases may actually represent a considerable cohort. In these cases anti-viral therapy and the development of resistance may be quite important. If resistant mutants become prevalent, as they did with seasonal H1N1, then resistance testing will be required but laboratories will not be able to support these requests as the necessary technology is relatively unavailable; empirical monotherapy with oseltamivir would became less comfortable and practice may quickly assume either the use of zanamivir as monotherapy or dual cover with oseltamivir. Accordingly, specific and/or sensitive detection method(s) for anti-viral resistant Influenza A (H1N1) 2009, is essential.",

The rapid emergence of resistance during treatment in Influenza A H1N1 and the step by step establishment of a predominantly mutant population within 48 hrs of therapy was unexpected and much faster than the 5 days reported with H5N1 (Gupta R. K. et al., 2006). It was also remarkable that the virus isolated from culture of the 38 hr sample was 100% mutant. This was despite the fact that 76% of the virus in the raw sample, prior to culture, was the wild type. This observation that the resistant mutant outgrew the wild type and became the dominant virus in cell culture is testimony to its fitness. Use of pyrosequencing directly on clinical material enabled the measurement of the dynamics of these mixed genotypes without the polluting or diluting effect of viral culture. Although it is an accurate method it still lacks the ability to exclude the presence of minority (<5%) sub-populations (Fakhrai-Rad H et al., 2002). However, the ability of the minority mutant population of 23% in the 38 hr sample to become the only detectable virus in the cultured isolate suggests that if the mutant had been present before therapy with oseltamivir, then it may have been detected it in the culture of the sample collected a few hours prior to therapy with oseltamivir, on day four of illness. However, only wild sequences were detected in virus isolated from this sample and only wild sequences were detected in 192 clones derived directly from the sample prior to culture. This data suggests that the mutation occurred and was selected for after day four.",
                                "The ct values in Table 1 show that the amount of virus was at a maximum on day five of illness, approximately a thousand fold greater than on day three and day six. This corresponds to the peak fever which was on days four and five and also to the first day of administration of oseltamivir. The administration of oseltamivir at the time when peak quantities of virus are present is a potent recipe for the selection of resistant mutants."
