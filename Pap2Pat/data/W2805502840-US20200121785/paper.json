    "title": "Gallid herpesvirus 3 SB-1 strain as a recombinant viral vector for poultry vaccination",
    "date": "2018-05-28",
    "abstract": "Live herpesvirus-vectored vaccines are widely used in veterinary medicine to protect against many infectious diseases. In poultry, three strains of herpesvirus vaccines are used against Marek's disease (MD). However, of these, only the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) has been successfully developed and used as a recombinant vaccine vector to induce protection against other avian viral diseases such as infectious bursal disease (IBD), Newcastle disease (ND) or avian influenza (AI). Although effective when administered individually, recombinant HVT vectors have limitations when combined in multivalent vaccines. Thus there is a need for developing additional viral vectors that could be combined with HVT in inducing protection against multiple avian diseases in multivalent vaccines. Gallid herpesvirus 3 (GaHV3) strain SB-1 is widely used by the poultry industry as bivalent vaccine in combination with HVT to exploit synergistic effects against MD. Here, we report the development and application of SB-1 as a vaccine vector to express the VP2 capsid antigen of IBD virus. A VP2 expression cassette was introduced into the SB-1 genome at three intergenic locations (UL3/UL4, UL10/UL11 and UL21/UL22) using recombineering methods on the full-length pSB-1 infectious clone of the virus. We show that the recombinant SB-1 vectors expressing VP2 induced neutralising antibody responses at levels comparable to that of commercial HVT-based VAXXITEKHVT+IBD vaccine. Birds vaccinated with the experimental recombinant SB-1 vaccine were protected against clinical disease after challenge with the very virulent UK661 IBDV isolate, demonstrating its value as an efficient viral vector for developing multivalent vaccines against avian diseases.",

                "Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV-1) or Gallid herpesvirus 2, belonging to the Mardivirus genus in the family Herpesviridae, is the causative agent of Marek\u2019s disease (MD) characterised by rapid-onset lymphomatous tumours and paralytic symptoms due to neuronal infiltration of lymphocytes. In infected birds, MDV replicates in the feather follicle epithelial cells, from where it is transmitted to other birds by inhalation of infected dust and dander. The mortality rate from MD usually varies between 10\u201330%, but can be up to 100% dependent on infecting strain, host susceptibility and/or vaccination status. MD has been controlled for more than 4 decades by the widespread use of live attenuated vaccines.1,2 Vaccine strains include the naturally attenuated MDV-1 strain Rispens (CVI988), MDV-2 (GaHV3) strain SB-1 and herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) strain FC126.",
                "In addition to their use as successful vaccines inducing long-term protection against MD, avian herpesvirus vaccine strains also have the potential to be used as recombinant vaccine viral vectors for inducing protection against other major avian diseases. The most successful and widely-used recombinant herpesvirus vaccine vector is the HVT strain which has been shown to be highly effective in protecting against a number of avian viral pathogens,3\u20136 even in the presence of maternal antibodies.7 Although individual recombinant HVT vaccines have proven to be extremely effective, combined use of more than one recombinant HVT vaccine has been shown to be less so. This is thought to be due to the interference between different HVT vaccines, because of which manufacturers do not recommend the use of combinations of HVT-based vaccines.8 Thus the combined use of HVT to protect against MD and another recombinant HVT vectored vaccine to induce protection against a second disease, may lead to a failure. Generation of multivalent HVT vectors expressing multiple foreign genes have also been technically challenging. With these constraints on the use of HVT vectored vaccines, there is a need for developing other vector platforms that will not interfere, but rather complement the induction of protective responses against multiple antigens in the vaccine.",
                "The first GaHV3 strain that was licensed for use as a vaccine against MD was the SB-1 strain.9 It was originally introduced in the mid-1980s and is still used very successfully in combination with the HVT vaccine, inducing protection against very virulent MDV pathotypes.2 Commercial bivalent vaccines containing SB-1 and HVT FC126 strains are widely used in many countries including USA, South America and Asia.1,10 SB-1/HVT bivalent vaccines are thought to provide superior protection against MD through a complementing effect2,11 even in maternal antibody-positive chicks.11 Because of the complementing effects of the HVT and SB-1 strains in inducing protection against MD, we reasoned that the SB-1 recombinant viral vector could be used as a bivalent vaccine in combination with recombinant HVT with complementary rather than inhibitory effects. We have previously shown that recombinant HVT expressing HA of AI virus was capable of producing immunity against MDV and AI lethal challenge.4",
                "The 166-Kb genome of the SB-1 strain of GaHV3 has a similar genome organisation as MDV-1, sharing a number of homologous genes12 as well as unique set of genes and microRNAs.13 We have previously reported the construction of the full-length infectious genome of the SB-1 strain in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) that could be used as a reverse genetics tool for manipulation of the viral genome.14,15 We have also shown that the virus reconstituted from the recombinant SB-1 BAC clone induced strong protection against virulent MDV challenge.15 This has allowed us to develop SB-1 as a recombinant vector for expressing protective antigens from other avian pathogens using the well-established recombineering techniques.16 Here we report the construction of a recombinant SB-1 viral vector engineered to express the VP2 capsid protein17 of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) to induce immune responses and protection against the very virulent UK661 IBDV isolate."

Expression of VP2 in cells infected with recombinant SB-1 viruses was assessed by staining with the anti-IBDV VP2 mouse monoclonal antibodies clone HH7 (IgG1) (Fig. 1 Panels A to D). SB-1 infection was confirmed by staining with anti-gB antibody Y5.9 (IgG1)18 (Fig. 1, Panels E to H).

                "Avian herpesvirus vaccines used against poultry diseases such as MD offer the additional advantage of being developed as potential viral vectors for inducing simultaneous protection against other avian diseases. The best example of this is the commercial use of recombinant HVT22,23 as a successful vaccine inducing simultaneous protection against MD and IBD. While HVT is a highly efficient recombinant vector that could be used to induce strong immune response to a number of avian pathogens, widespread usage of HVT-vectored vaccines is hampered by the apparent interference between the recombinant viruses, for reasons that remain poorly understood. Recombinant vaccines based on other avian herpesvirus vaccine strains such as MDV-1 have been experimentally shown to be effective against diseases such as IBD, but are not yet commercially available.24,25 Considering the need for protecting poultry against multiple pathogens, there is the need for additional vector platforms that can deliver protective antigens without interference with the herpesvirus vaccines used in poultry.",
                "In this study, we report the use of MDV-2 (GaHV3) strain SB-1 as a viral vector, generating three independent constructs that express IBDV VP2 in one of three different locations in the viral genome: loci UL3/4, UL10/11 and UL21/22. The expression of the VP2 cassette from the three loci appeared to slow the growth of SB-1 in vitro. Among the three locations, the VP2 expressing transcripts were appeared to have a higher level of expression from the UL3-UL4 location compared to UL21-UL22 or UL10-UL11 loci. On the other hand, level of expression for the adjacent genes was shown to be least affected when the transgene was expressed from the UL10-UL11 location.",
                "Immunogenicity of the recombinant SB-1 vaccines was assessed by measuring the neutralising antibody levels in vaccinated chickens. Neutralising antibodies started to appear from week 2 and rose to a maximum titre of 640 in week four post-vaccination. All the birds in all four groups showed neutralising antibodies by 4 weeks. Although not statistically significant, the mean values of neutralising antibodies in the groups inoculated with the experimental vaccines were higher than those of the group that received the commercial vaccine. In the second experiment, we examined the effect of the SB-1 vaccines administered at a reduced dose of 1000 plaque forming units (pfu), compared to the 3000\u20135000 pfu dose of VAXXITEKHVT+IBD given in both experiments. In comparison with experiment 1, only a very limited number of birds showed neutralising antibodies at week 3 post vaccination, presumably reflecting the smaller dose given. In spite of this, all of the groups showed 100% protection against IBDV after an experimental challenge with the very virulent UK661 strain of IBD virus, compared to the group vaccinated with the parental pSB-1 vaccine that not express the VP2 antigen. This suggests that the mechanism of protection may not be solely mediated by high titres of serum neutralising antibodies, and that cellular or mucosal responses may also contribute. However an evaluation of the mechanism of protection is beyond the scope of this study. Moreover, demonstration of protective responses elicited by the recombinant SB-1 vaccine against very virulent IBDV infection when used at levels comparable to the widely used VAXXITEKHVT+IBD vaccine confirms the value of SB-1 as a recombinant vaccine vector platform for avian diseases.",
                "MDV and IBDV are highly infectious viruses producing diseases with high mortality rates that have made them a constant threat to the productivity of the worldwide poultry industry for decades. The presence of maternal antibodies, emergence of new antigenic and pathogenic variants, cost of production, and in some cases lack of compliance with DIVA strategy (reviewed in26) are challenges that limit the efficient control of IBDV, while MDV vaccines have been demonstrated to drive virulence of the pathogen over the last 50 years.26 Bivalent MDV/IBDV vaccines allow for vaccination against both diseases simultaneously, lowering the costs of production and inoculation. They are also safer and can be given as in ovo vaccination, unlike attenuated IBDV vaccines that cause subclinical IBD in chicks and are fatal to embryos. While the VAXXITEKHVT+IBD vaccine based on the HVT vector is widely used as a successful vaccine against IBD in many countries, there is constraint on the use of this recombinant vaccine in combination with other HVT-based vaccines, because of interference with the induction of immune responses against the components of other vaccines. Although the mechanisms of such interference between HVT-based vaccines still remain unclear, there is a definite need for other vector platforms that can complement the HVT-based vectors in multivalent vaccines.",
                "In this paper we show that a GaHV3 (MDV-2) strain SB-1, already in use as a licensed vaccine against MD since the mid-1980s, can be used as a viral vector expressing the IBDV VP2 capsid antigen to induce complete protection against a challenge with a 100% lethal dose of IBDV. We have identified three locations in the SB-1 genome that tolerated the VP2 expression cassette, and we predict that these loci will also support the delivery of genes from other pathogens as well. With a long history of successful use with HVT as bivalent vaccine against MD, SB-1 has not shown any interference in inducing immune responses against MD. On the contrary, SB-1/HVT bivalent vaccines do provide superior protection against MD than either vaccine used alone, through synergistic effects.2,27 Our results demonstrating the potential of the recombinant SB-1 to protect against IBD offers immense opportunities for its use as a bivalent vaccine together with recombinant HVT to induce simultaneous protection against multiple avian diseases, exploiting their enhanced synergistic immune functions."

The cells were washed with PBS and scraped from the plate. RNA purification was performed using RNeasy Qiagen kit. Extracted RNA was treated with DNAseI (New England Biolabs) for 30\u2009min followed by heat inactivation at 75\u00b0 to degrade any carry over DNA. Reverse transcription was performed using random primers and Revertaid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described by the manufacturer. SYBR green based real-time PCR assay was performed using PowerUp SYBR green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The real-time PCR reactions were assembled in 10\u2009\u03bcl volumes and in an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time-PCR system. PCR cycles were programmed as recommended by the manufacturer with annealing at 60\u2009\u00b0C (30\u2009s) and extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C (30\u2009s). The signal was collected at the extension cycle. Melt curve analysis was performed after each PCR run to eliminate the possibility of non-specific amplifications. To compare the data, \u0394\u0394Ct value was calculated for each gene of interest. To do so, the Ct value of GAPDH in each real-time PCR experiment was used as the house keeping gene. The Ct values for each of the genes studied in CEF cells infected with SB-1 parental virus was used as the calibrator. The assay was performed in three biological replicates with all of the samples were kept at \u221220 and analysed at the same time for RNA purification and Real-time PCR assay. SYBR green PCR primers were designed using Primer3 primer design server. They were validated by conventional PCR prior to perform the assay.
