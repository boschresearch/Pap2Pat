                        "Prostate cancer is a common public health problem. In 2010, this disease was diagnosed in an estimated 217,730 men (28% of all male cancers) and resulted in 32,050 deaths (11% of male cancer deaths) (Jemal et al., CA Cancer J Clin 59(4):225-49 (2009)). If left untreated, the majority of prostate cancers remain asymptomatic and indolent for decades (Klotz et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010) 28:126-31). If treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, the risk of metastasis is reduced, but erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and rectal bleeding may occur, affecting the patient's quality of life. Because it is currently difficult to determine accurately which patients will develop metastatic disease, physicians treat patients with mid-to-late stage local disease aggressively, even when such treatment may not be required. Clinical parameters, such as serum concentration of prostate specific antigen (PSA), extension beyond surgical margins, invasion of seminal vesicles, extension beyond the capsule, Gleason score, prostate weight, race and year of surgery, are employed in existing nomograms for prediction of local recurrences (Ohori et al., Mod Pathol 17(3): 349-359 (2004)), but local recurrence and, therefore, these parameters have limited utility for predicting progression of the disease to distant sites (Nakagawa et al., PLoS One 3(5):e2318 (2008)). Development of a robust risk model that accurately predicts the potential of a local prostate cancer to metastasize would justify aggressive treatment in high-risk cases and improve the quality of life for men with indolent disease."

Examples of solid surfaces include nitrocellulose, nylon, glass, quartz, silicones, polyformaldehyde, cellulose, cellulose acetate; and plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and the like; gelatins, agarose and silicates, among others. High density immobilization of nucleic acid probes are used for high complexity comparative hybridizations which will reduce the total amount of sample nucleic acids required for binding to each immobilized probe.",

For example, in a comparative genomic hybridization assay, a first collection of nucleic acids (e.g., sample from a possible tumor) is labeled with a first label, while a second collection of nucleic acids (e.g., control from a healthy cell or tissue) is labeled with a second label. The ratio of hybridization of the nucleic acids is determined by the ratio of the two labels binding to each member in the array. Where there are genomic deletions or amplifications, differences in the ratio of the signals from the two labels will be detected and provide a measure of the copy number."

On the other hand, a decrease in the sample in the copy number for one or more of the genes or genomic regions of a metastatic signature gene set disclosed herein, whose deletions have been associated with metastatic prostate cancer, will indicate a higher risk of metastasis as compared to a control in which no decrease in the copy number is observed.",
                                "For example, for a metastatic signature gene set composed of the top 20 genes and genomic regions listed in Table 6, an increase in the copy number per cell of the sample for all of the SLCO5A1 genomic region, the KCNB2 genomic region, the KCNH4 genomic region, the JPH1 genomic region, the NCALD genomic region, and the YWHAG gene, and a decrease in the sample in the copy number per cell of the sample for all of the PPP3CC genomic region, the SLC7A5 genomic region, the SLC7A2 genomic region, the CRISPLD2 genomic region, the CDH13 gene, the CDH8 gene, the CDH2 gene, the ASAH1 genomic region, the CTD8 gene, the MEST genomic region, the COL19A1 gene, the MAP3K7 genomic region, the NOL4 genomic region, and the ENOX1 gene, correlate with an increased risk of prostate cancer metastasis. However, it is not necessary for all the genes and genomic regions within a signature set to change in the same direction as set forth in Table 6 in order to have a reasonably reliable prediction of the risk. That is, an increased risk can be predicted based on an increase in the copy number per cell of the sample for one or more, preferably a plurality of, the SLCO5A1 genomic region, the KCNB2 genomic region, the KCNH4 genomic region, the JPH1 genomic region, the NCALD genomic region, and the YWHAG gene, and/or a decrease in the sample in the copy number per cell of the sample for one or more, preferably a plurality of, the PPP3CC genomic region, the SLC7A5 genomic region, the SLC7A2 genomic region, the CRISPLD2 genomic region, the CDH13 gene, the CDH8 gene, the CDH2 gene, the ASAH1 genomic region, the CTD8 gene, the MEST genomic region, the COL19A1 gene, the MAP3K7 genomic region, the NOL4 genomic region, or the ENOX1 gene. By \u201cplurality\u201d it is meant at least 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 of the top 20 genes and gene regions listed in Table 6.",

Thus, essentially, the logistic adjusted Z-scores from genes (i . . . n) that match the metastasis signature are added, whereas from genes that mismatch the signature are subtracted. The logistic adjusted Z-scores (Zadjust) for each of the 368 genes of the full metastatic signature set are found in Table 6.",

Such reference distributions can be predetermined or calculated side-by-side in the same experiment as the sample being investigated. In many of the embodiments, the reference metastatic potential score equals to or is approximately 1.0. Therefore, an increase in the metastatic potential score of a test subject as compared to the control score from the reference distributions is correlated with an increased risk of metastasis of prostate cancer. According to this disclosure, a one-point increase in the metastatic potential score corresponds to an odds ratio of 6.3 for progression to metastasis (p=0.01). In some embodiments, an increase in the metastatic potential score as compared to a reference score by at least about 0.5, 0.53, 0.56, 0.58, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7 or greater, is considered to represent a significantly high risk of metastasis.",

This predictor may be important for correctly categorizing men at the time of diagnosis and can lead to a choice of therapy that would maximize their chances of survival and minimize adverse side effects if aggressive treatment can be avoided. Thus, both treatment outcomes and quality of life could be improved. In addition, because the proposed tool, tumor genomic analysis, is comprehensive for identifying the genetic changes that are associated with pathogenesis and metastases, there is a greater likelihood of selecting a sufficient number of markers that are both sensitive and specific predictors. Furthermore, because these genomic alterations are themselves susceptible to manipulation with drugs, radiation or other therapies, they could provide a basis for assessing intermediate endpoints, such as androgen sensitivity and response to radiation. Ultimately, copy number alterations could guide the development of individually tailored therapies, including for cancers other than prostate."

The control samples were defined as primary tumors that had not progressed to form distant metastases following radical prostatectomy. Given that radical prostatectomy cures both indolent primary tumors (iPTs) that would not metastasize and primary tumors that would otherwise progress to form metastasis, if left untreated, the control primary tumors would actually represent a mix of iPTs and unrealized mPTs. Assuming a randomly sampled cohort, it is expected that approximately 30% of the control group of primary tumors would be unrealized mPTs. The methods developed herein required only the prior information of whether a sample was derived from a metastasis and were designed to be robust to the confounder of mixed phenotypes.",

The first model was trained using 49 primary tumors of unknown clinical outcome from NYU (n=29) and Baylor (n=20) and a metastasis cohort from Hopkins (n=13). The second model was trained using 75% of the MSK cohort of primary tumors of unknown outcome (n=126) along with a set of metastatic tumors (n=36). The gene signatures and MPS scores derived from these 2 models were combined to fit a logistic regression model and used to predict bona fide mPTs (primary tumors that later developed into distant metastasis) and a random sample of 25% control tumors from MSK cohort not used to train either model. Prediction accuracy was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Kaplan-Meier metastasis-free survival."

Using the results from 20,000 iterations of the clustering, a similarity index was generated for each sample, representing the number of times it fell in a cluster with the metastasis profile.

For example, probes that were amplified in all metastases and mPTs, but deleted in all iPTs would yield the highest possible score.

The metastatic potential score in the lymph node positive primary tumors (derived from the MSK (n=9) and SU (n=9) cohorts) did not differ significantly from the control tumor group (PMSK=0.23, Psu=0.19, Pcombined=0.08), which reflected the marginal ability of this clinical parameter to predict distant metastasis (BOORJIAN et al., Journal of Urology 178(3 Pt 1): 864-70; discussion 70-1 (2007)). Consistent with our assumption that the control cohorts contained a fraction of mPTs, their metastatic potential score overlapped the range of the cases. Furthermore, control primary tumors that did not recur biochemically (as measured by PSA) after 80 months of follow-up, (represented by Xs in FIG. 1) were not correlated with the metastatic potential score. To determine whether other cancer types exhibited a similar metastatic landscape of CNAs to that observed in prostate cancer, the metastatic potential scores for 337 cancer cell lines were calculated. An overall distribution that overlapped with low-risk prostate primary tumors was observed (FIG. 1). However, 22 of the 337 cell lines emerged above the 75th percentile of the prostate primary tumors and metastases, ranked by MPS. These cell lines originated from tumors of the lung (n=10), breast (n=3), colon (n=2) and melanoma (n=2). Other singletons in this group of 22 cell lines originated from thyroid, rectum, pharynx, pancreas and kidney (Table 4).",

Considering that control primary tumors were a mixture of treated mPTs and iPTs, the quality of fit was believed to be an underestimate. Applying the instant prediction to a Kaplan-Meier analysis with the clinical endpoint of metastasis-free survival (FIG. 2, right graph) resulted in a significant separation (p=0.014) of the low-risk half of the cohort (based on the metastatic potential score) compared to the high-risk half.

The mid-risk region with its relative paucity of genomic events may represent the starting point of two alternative pathways of subsequent copy number alteration, one leading to metastasis and the other to an indolent state. The locking in of these \u2018anti-metastasis\u2019 events in indolent tumors may explain why they fail to metastasize despite extended periods of watchful waiting.",

One of the top predictor genes, the solute carrier family SLC7A5 gene deleted on chromosome 16q24.2, encodes a neutral amino acid transporter protein (LAT1) that has been implicated in multiple cancers (prostate (Sakata et al., Pathol Int 59(1):7-18 (2009)), breast (Kaira et al., Cancer Science 99(12):2380-6 (2008)), ovarian (Kaji et al., International Journal of Gynecol Cancer 20(3):329-36 (2010)), lung (Imai et al., Histopathology 54(7):804-13 (2009)) and brain (Kobayashi et al., Neurosurgery 62(2):493-503; discussion \u22124 (2008))) and has been shown to have utility as a diagnostic (Bartlett et al., Breast Cancer Research 12(4): R47 (2010); Ring et al., Mod Pathol 22(8):1032-43 (2009); Ring et al., Journal of Clinical Oncology 24(19):3039-47 (2006)) and drug target in cell line (Fan et al., Biochem Pharmacol 80(6):811-8 (2010); Yamauchi et al., Cancer Letter 276(1):95-101 (2009); Kim et al., Biol Pharm Bull 31(6):1096-100 (2008)) and pre-clinical animal models (Oda et al., Cancer Science 101(1):173-9 (2010)). The normal function of LAT1 is to regulate cellular amino acid concentrations\u2014L-glutamine (efflux) and L-leucine (influx). Reduced activity of LAT1 results in increased concentrations of L-glutamine which has been shown to constitutively fuel mTOR activity (Nicklin et al., Cell 136(3):521-34 (2009)) and targeting of glutamine utilization through the use of a glutamine analog, dramatically reduced tumor growth and metastasis in cellular and in vivo mouse models (Shelton et al., International Journal of Cancer 127(10):2478-85). Five other solute carrier superfamily members (SLC7A2, SLC9A9, SLC26A7, SLC39A14, and SLCO5A1) were predictive of metastatic potential in the models disclosed herein. A ninth SLC gene, SLC44A1, encoding a choline transporter (Michel et al., Faseb J 23(8):2749-58 (2009)), was identified as part a of a 17-gene expression signature, comparing prostate primary tumors of men treated with radical prostatectomy that metastasized versus men that recurred biochemically, but did not metastasize (Nakagawa et al., supra).",

Three other potassium channels reside in the highly amplified region between 8q13 and 8q24 (KCNS2, KCNV1 and KCNK9) that did not rank high in our analysis, but may have weak or modifier effects. High levels of cytoplasmic potassium ion concentration are maintained by BCL-2, a putative oncogene, through the inhibition of potassium channel transcription. These high levels were shown to inhibit a necessary precursor to the hallmark mitochondrial apoptotic cascade of membrane disruption and ensuing release of cytochrome C, caspase, and nuclease degradation of cellular components (Ekhterae et al., American Journal of Physiol Cell Physiol 2001; 281(1): C157-65 (2001)). Furthermore, another study has shown that the hyper-methylation status of potassium channel KCNMA1 (10q22.3) has predictive value for prostate cancer recurrence (Vanaja et al., Cancer Invest 27(5):549-60 (2009)). The activity of voltage-gated potassium channels in prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (low metastatic potential) and PC3 (high metastatic potential), were observed to be markedly different (Laniado et al., Prostate 46(4):262-74 (2001)).
