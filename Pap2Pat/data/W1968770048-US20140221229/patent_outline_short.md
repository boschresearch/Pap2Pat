# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

- define metastatic gene signatures

## BACKGROUND ART

- motivate need for metastasis prediction

## SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

- introduce method for metastasis risk determination
- describe metastatic gene signature sets

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce risk model for predicting metastasis of prostate cancer

### Metastatic Gene Signature

- develop metastatic gene signature set from studies of genomic landscape of copy number alterations
- identify 368 genes associated with metastasis
- describe clumps of genes and genomic regions
- provide smaller metastatic gene signature sets with at least 80, 40, 20, or 12 non-overlapping genes and/or genomic regions
- determine hierarchy of genes contributing to prediction of metastatic potential
- describe top genes and genomic regions in metastatic gene signature set

### Determination of Risk

- determine copy number alterations for each gene or genomic region in metastatic signature gene set
- correlate copy number alterations with risk of metastasis
- calculate metastatic potential score based on copy number alterations

### Diagnostic Kits

- provide diagnostic kits for performing methods described herein

## EXAMPLES

- describe predictive metastasis model development

### Example 1

- develop predictive biomarkers
- describe sample processing and study design

### Example 2

- describe analytical pipeline for metastatic potential clinical risk model
