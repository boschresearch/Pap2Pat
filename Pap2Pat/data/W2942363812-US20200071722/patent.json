Some aspects of this disclosure provide evolved recombinases, e.g., recombinases that bind and recombine naturally-occurring target sequences, such as, e.g., target sequences within the human Rosa26 locus. Methods for using such recombinases for genetically engineering nucleic acid molecules in vitro and in vivo are also provided.

While some tools for site-specific modifications of genomic sequences have been developed, such as, for example, site-specific nucleases or nickases that can introduce double-stranded or single-stranded cuts in a genomic target sequence, the targeted integration, deletion, or inversion of sequences within a genome relies on relatively ineffective technologies, such as homologous recombination and gene targeting. Methods and molecular tools for direct manipulation of a target sequence within a genome are therefore highly desirable."

                        "The ability to precisely modify the genome of human cells has enormous potential as a novel therapy and a powerful research tool. Programmable nucleases, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) or Cas9, can specifically cleave DNA at a target sequence, but they rely on stochastic host cells processes to effect gene insertion or other genome modifications. In contrast, site specific recombinases directly catalyze genomic recombination at a target sequence with high specificity and efficiency. Recombinases can be used, for example, to effect insertions, deletions, and inversions of nucleic acid sequences at a specific target sequence. In some embodiments, recombinases can also be used to exchange nucleic acid sequences, e.g., in the context of replacing a sequence associated with a disease or disorder with a sequence not associated with a disease or disorder.",
                        "A major limitation of using recombinases for effecting targeted genomic modifications is that recombinases, such as serine or tyrosine recombinases (e.g., Cre recombinase; \u03bb phage integrase; FLP recombinase; phiC31 integrase; Dre recombinase; BxB 1; Hin; and prokaryotic \u03b2-recombinase), typically bind relatively complex DNA target sequences (e.g., LoxP sites in the case of Cre recombinase or FRT sites in the case of FLP recombinases) with high specificity. Target cells lacking the required recombinase target sequence within their genome can thus not be efficiently modified. For example, mouse and human cells typically lack recombinase target sequences within their genome and can thus not be easily modified using recombinases. While it is possible to introduce a native recombinase target sequence (e.g., a wild-type LoxP or FRT site) into a desired genetic locus within a cell's genome, and thus render the cell suitable for modification with a native recombinase, the introduction of such recombinase target sequences typically requires time- and labor-intensive gene targeting strategies.",
                        "Some aspects of this disclosure are based on the surprising discovery that recombinases can be evolved to recognize non-native DNA target sequences via directed evolution methods, e.g., by the phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) strategies and methods disclosed herein. For an overview of PACE technology, see, for example, International PCT Application, PCT/US2009/056194, filed Sep. 8, 2009, published as WO 2010/028347 on Mar. 11, 2010; International PCT Application, PCT/US2011/066747, filed Dec. 22, 2011, published as WO 2012/088381 on Jun. 28, 2012; and U.S. Application, U.S. Ser. No. 13/922,812, filed Jun. 20, 2013, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Using the evolution strategies and methods provided herein, recombinases can be adapted to target virtually any desired sequence, e.g., any locus within the genome of a cell. This allows, for example, for the introduction of recombinant sequences into the genome of a desired target cell without the need for inserting a recombinase target sequence first. In addition, the evolved recombinases can also be used to remove, invert, or replace nucleic acid sequences from a target sequence, e.g., from a genomic sequence in a cell or subject.",

                        "The term \u201caccessory plasmid,\u201d as used herein, refers to a plasmid comprising a gene required for the generation of infectious viral particles under the control of a conditional promoter. In the context of continuous evolution of recombinases described herein, transcription from the conditional promoter of the accessory plasmid is typically activated by a function of the recombinase to be evolved. Accordingly, the accessory plasmid serves the function of conveying a competitive advantage to those viral vectors in a given population of viral vectors that carry a gene of interest able to activate the conditional promoter. Only viral vectors carrying an \u201cactivating\u201d version of the recombinase of interest will be able to induce expression of the gene required to generate infectious viral particles in the host cell, and, thus, allow for packaging of infectious viral particles and propagation of the viral genome in the flow of host cells. Vectors carrying non-activating versions of the recombinase of interest, on the other hand, will not induce expression of the gene required to generate infectious viral vectors, and, thus, will not be packaged into viral particles that can infect fresh host cells.",
                        "The term \u201ccellstat,\u201d as used herein, refers to a culture vessel comprising host cells, in which the number of cells is substantially constant over time.",
                        "The term \u201ccontinuous evolution,\u201d as used herein, refers to an evolution process, in which a population of nucleic acids encoding a recombinase of interest is subjected to multiple rounds of (a) replication, (b) mutation, and (c) selection to produce a desired evolved recombinase that is different from the original recombinase of interest, for example, in that it binds and recombines a target site not recognized by the original recombinase, or in that it binds and recombines a target site with higher affinity or efficiency than the original recombinase. The multiple rounds can be performed without investigator intervention, and the steps (a)-(c) can be carried out simultaneously. Typically, the evolution procedure is carried out in vitro, for example, using cells in culture as host cells. In general, a continuous evolution process provided herein relies on a system in which a gene encoding a recombinase of interest is provided in a viral vector that undergoes a life-cycle including replication in a host cell and transfer to another host cell, wherein a critical component of the life-cycle, e.g., a gene essential for the generation of infectious viral particles, is deactivated and reactivation of the component is dependent upon an activity of the recombinase of interest that is a result of a mutation in the viral vector.",
                        "The term \u201cflow\u201d, as used herein in the context of host cells, refers to a stream of host cells, wherein fresh host cells not harboring the transfer vector (e.g., the viral vector encoding the recombinase of interest) are being introduced into a host cell population, for example, a host cell population in a lagoon, remain within the population for a limited time, and are then removed from the host cell population. In a simple form, a host cell flow may be a flow through a tube, or a channel, for example, at a controlled rate. In other embodiments, a flow of host cells is directed through a lagoon that holds a volume of cell culture media and comprises an inflow and an outflow. The introduction of fresh host cells may be continuous or intermittent and removal may be passive, e.g., by overflow, or active, e.g., by active siphoning or pumping. Removal further may be random, for example, if a stirred suspension culture of host cells is provided, removed liquid culture media will contain freshly introduced host cells as well as cells that have been a member of the host cell population within the lagoon for some time. Even though, in theory, a cell could escape removal from the lagoon indefinitely, the average host cell will remain only for a limited period of time within the lagoon, which is determined mainly by the flow rate of the culture media (and suspended cells) through the lagoon. Since the viral vectors replicate in a flow of host cells, in which fresh, uninfected host cells are provided while infected cells are removed, multiple consecutive viral life cycles can occur without investigator interaction, which allows for the accumulation of multiple advantageous mutations in a single evolution experiment.",

A fresh host cell can, however, have been infected by a viral vector unrelated to the vector to be evolved or by a vector of the same or a similar type but not carrying the gene of interest.",

The term includes any variations of a gene of interest that are the result of a continuous evolution process according to methods provided herein. For example, in some embodiments, a gene of interest is a nucleic acid construct comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a recombinase to be evolved, cloned into a viral vector, for example, a phage genome, so that the expression of the encoding sequence is under the control of one or more promoters in the viral genome. In other embodiments, a gene of interest is a nucleic acid construct comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a recombinase to be evolved and a promoter operably linked to the encoding sequence. When cloned into a viral vector, for example, a phage genome, the expression of the encoding sequence of such genes of interest is under the control of the heterologous promoter and, in some embodiments, may also be influenced by one or more promoters comprised in the viral genome.",
                        "The term \u201chelper phage,\u201d as used herein interchangeable with the terms \u201chelper phagemid\u201d and \u201chelper plasmid,\u201d refers to a nucleic acid construct comprising a phage gene required for the phage life cycle, or a plurality of such genes, but lacking a structural element required for genome packaging into a phage particle. For example, a helper phage may provide a wild-type phage genome lacking a phage origin of replication. In some embodiments, a helper phage is provided that comprises a gene required for the generation of phage particles, but lacks a gene required for the generation of infectious particles, for example, a full-length pIII gene. In some embodiments, the helper phage provides only some, but not all, genes for the generation of infectious phage particles. Helper phages are useful to allow modified phages that lack a gene for the generation of infectious phage particles to complete the phage life cycle in a host cell. Typically, a helper phage will comprise the genes for the generation of infectious phage particles that are lacking in the phage genome, thus complementing the phage genome. In the continuous evolution context, the helper phage typically complements the selection phage, but both lack a phage gene required for the production of infectious phage particles.",

In some embodiments, a low copy number accessory plasmid is a plasmid exhibiting an average copy number of plasmid per host cell in a host cell population of about 5 to about 100. In some embodiments, a very low copy number accessory plasmid is a plasmid exhibiting an average copy number of plasmid per host cell in a host cell population of about 1 to about 10. In some embodiments, a very low copy number accessory plasmid is a single-copy per cell plasmid. In some embodiments, a high copy number accessory plasmid is a plasmid exhibiting an average copy number of plasmid per host cell in a host cell population of about 100 to about 5000.",
                        "The term \u201chost cell,\u201d as used herein, refers to a cell that can host, replicate, and transfer a phage vector useful for a continuous evolution process as provided herein. In embodiments where the vector is a viral vector, a suitable host cell is a cell that can be infected by the viral vector, can replicate it, and can package it into viral particles that can infect fresh host cells. A cell can host a viral vector if it supports expression of genes of viral vector, replication of the viral genome, and/or the generation of viral particles. One criterion to determine whether a cell is a suitable host cell for a given viral vector is to determine whether the cell can support the viral life cycle of a wild-type viral genome that the viral vector is derived from. For example, if the viral vector is a modified M13 phage genome, as provided in some embodiments described herein, then a suitable host cell would be any cell that can support the wild-type M13 phage life cycle. Suitable host cells for viral vectors useful in continuous evolution processes are well known to those of skill in the art, and the disclosure is not limited in this respect.",
                        "The term \u201cinfectious viral particle,\u201d as used herein, refers to a viral particle able to transport the viral genome it comprises into a suitable host cell. Not all viral particles are able to transfer the viral genome to a suitable host cell. Particles unable to accomplish this are referred to as non-infectious viral particles. In some embodiments, a viral particle comprises a plurality of different coat proteins, wherein one or some of the coat proteins can be omitted without compromising the structure of the viral particle. In some embodiments, a viral particle is provided in which at least one coat protein cannot be omitted without the loss of infectivity. If a viral particle lacks a protein that confers infectivity, the viral particle is not infectious. For example, an M13 phage particle that comprises a phage genome packaged in a coat of phage proteins (e.g., pVIII) but lacks pIII (protein III) is a non-infectious M13 phage particle because pIII is essential for the infectious properties of M13 phage particles.",

Accordingly, the presently described evolution methods and strategies and the evolved recombinases obtained via these strategies and methods can be used to modify, for example, any sequence within the genome of a cell or subject. Because recombinases can effect an insertion of a heterologous nucleic acid molecule into a target nucleic acid molecule, an excision of a nucleic acid sequence from a nucleic acid molecule, an inversion, or a replacement of nucleic acid sequences, the technology provided herein enables the efficient modification of genomic targets in a variety of ways (e.g., integration, deletion, inversion, exchange of nucleic acid sequences).",

                                "Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), allows proteins and other gene products to undergo directed evolution at a rate \u02dc100-fold faster than conventional methods. FIG. 1 provides a schematic overview of an exemplary embodiment of PACE. During PACE, an evolving population of filamentous bacteriophages (\u201cselection phage\u201d, SP) is continuously diluted in a flow of host cells through a fixed-volume vessel (a \u201clagoon\u201d). The flow rate of host cells through the lagoon results in an average time of hosts cells within the lagoon that is too short for host cell division, but longer than the average phage replication cycle, thus allowing only the phage to propagate and accumulate mutations.",
                                "Typically, each SP carries an evolving gene, for example, a gene encoding a recombinase, and lacks at least one phage gene that is essential for the generation of infectious phage particles, e.g., gene III in M13 phages. The host cells typically provide the phage gene lacking from the SP on an accessory plasmid (AP) that expresses the phage gene lacking from the SP in response to a desired activity of the evolving gene (e.g., a desired recombinase activity). As a result, only SP encoding variants of the evolving gene product having the desired activity are able to generate infectious progeny and propagate to other cells, while SP encoding inactive variants produce non-infectious progeny that cannot infect new host cells and are thus diluted out of the lagoon. PACE has been used to rapidly evolve RNA polymerases and proteases with tailor-made properties. It was tested whether the PACE system could be adapted to evolve DNA-binding domains with altered or improved DNA-binding specificity.",
                                "In some embodiments, the SP phage is a filamentous phage or phagemid. In some embodiments, the phage is an M13 phage. M13 phages are well known to those in the art and the biology of M13 phages has extensively been studied. Wild type M13 phage particles comprise a circular, single-stranded genome of approximately 6.4 kb. The wilt-type genome includes ten genes, gI-gX, which, in turn, encode the ten M13 proteins, pI-pX, respectively. gVIII encodes pVIII, also often referred to as the major structural protein of the phage particles, while gIII encodes pIII, also referred to as the minor coat protein, which is required for infectivity of M13 phage particles.",
                                "The M13 life cycle includes attachment of the phage to the sex pilus of a suitable bacterial host cell via the pIII protein and insertion of the phage genome into the host cell. The circular, single-stranded phage genome is then converted to a circular, double-stranded DNA, also termed the replicative form (RF), from which phage gene transcription is initiated. The wild type M13 genome comprises nine promoters and two transcriptional terminators as well as an origin of replication. This series of promoters provides a gradient of transcription such that the genes nearest the two transcriptional terminators (gVIII and IV) are transcribed at the highest levels. In wild-type M13 phage, transcription of all 10 genes proceeds in same direction. One of the phage-encode proteins, pII, initiates the generation of linear, single-stranded phage genomes in the host cells, which are subsequently circularized, and bound and stabilized by pV. The circularized, single-stranded M13 genomes are then bound by pVIII, while pV is stripped off the genome, which initiates the packaging process. At the end of the packaging process, multiple copies of pIII are attached to wild-type M13 particles, thus generating infectious phage ready to infect another host cell and concluding the life cycle.",
                                "The M13 phage genome can be manipulated, for example, by deleting one or more of the wild type genes, and/or inserting a heterologous nucleic acid construct into the genome. M13 does not have stringent genome size restrictions, and insertions of up to 42 kb have been reported. This allows M13 phage vectors to be used in continuous evolution experiments to evolve genes of interest without imposing a limitation on the length of the gene to be involved.",
                                "In some embodiments, the host cells comprise an accessory plasmid that drives expression of a gene essential for the generation of infectious viral particles from a conditional promoter. In some embodiments, the conditional promoter of the accessory plasmid is a promoter the transcriptional activity of which can be regulated over a wide range, for example, over 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 orders of magnitude by the activating function, for example, function of a protein encoded by the gene of interest. In some embodiments, the level of transcriptional activity of the conditional promoter depends directly on the desired function of the gene of interest. This allows for starting a continuous evolution process with a viral vector population comprising versions of the gene of interest that only effect minimal activation of the conditional promoter. In the process of continuous evolution, any mutation in the gene of interest that increases activity of the conditional promoter directly translates into higher expression levels of the gene required for the generation of infectious viral particles, and, thus, into a competitive advantage over other viral vectors carrying minimally active or loss-of-function versions of the gene of interest.",
                                "The stringency of selective pressure imposed by the accessory plasmid in a continuous evolution procedure as provided herein can be modulated. In some embodiments, the use of low copy number accessory plasmids results in an elevated stringency of selection for versions of the gene of interest that activate the conditional promoter on the accessory plasmid, while the use of high copy number accessory plasmids results in a lower stringency of selection. The terms \u201chigh copy number plasmid\u201d and \u201clow copy number plasmid\u201d are art-recognized and those of skill in the art will be able to ascertain whether a given plasmid is a high or low copy number plasmid. In some embodiments, a low copy number accessory plasmid is a plasmid exhibiting an average copy number of plasmid per host cell in a host cell population of about 5 to about 100. In some embodiments, a very low copy number accessory plasmid is a plasmid exhibiting an average copy number of plasmid per host cell in a host cell population of about 1 to about 10. In some embodiments, a very low copy number accessory plasmid is a single-copy per cell plasmid. In some embodiments, a high copy number accessory plasmid is a plasmid exhibiting an average copy number of plasmid per host cell in a host cell population of about 100 to about 5000. The copy number of an accessory plasmid will depend to a large part on the origin of replication employed. Those of skill in the art will be able to determine suitable origins of replication in order to achieve a desired copy number.",
                                "It should be understood that the function of the accessory plasmid, namely to provide a gene required for the generation of viral particles under the control of a conditional promoter the activity of which depends on a function of the gene of interest, can be conferred to a host cell in alternative ways. Such alternatives include, but are not limited to, permanent insertion of a gene construct comprising the conditional promoter and the respective gene into the genome of the host cell, or introducing it into the host cell using an different vector, for example, a phagemid, a cosmid, a phage, a virus, or an artificial chromosome. Additional ways to confer accessory plasmid function to host cells will be evident to those of skill in the art, and the invention is not limited in this respect.",

In some embodiments, such modified viral vectors lack a gene required for the generation of infectious viral particles. In some such embodiments, a suitable host cell is a cell comprising the gene required for the generation of infectious viral particles, for example, under the control of a constitutive or a conditional promoter (e.g., in the form of an accessory plasmid, as described herein). In some embodiments, the viral vector used lacks a plurality of viral genes. In some such embodiments, a suitable host cell is a cell that comprises a helper construct providing the viral genes required for the generation of viral particles. A cell is not required to actually support the life cycle of a viral vector used in the methods provided herein. For example, a cell comprising a gene required for the generation of infectious viral particles under the control of a conditional promoter may not support the life cycle of a viral vector that does not comprise a gene of interest able to activate the promoter, but it is still a suitable host cell for such a viral vector. In some embodiments, the viral vector is a phage and the host cell is a bacterial cell. In some embodiments, the host cell is an E. coli cell. Suitable E. coli host strains will be apparent to those of skill in the art, and include, but are not limited to, New England Biolabs (NEB) Turbo, Top10F\u2032, DH12S, ER2738, ER2267, and XL1-Blue MRF\u2032.

Thus, for example, intervening untranslated but transcribed sequences can be present between a promoter sequence and the coding sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered operably linked to the coding sequence. A promoter sequence, as described herein, is a DNA regulatory region a short distance from the 5\u2032 end of a gene that acts as the binding site for RNA polymerase. The promoter sequence may bind RNA polymerase in a cell and/or initiate transcription of a downstream (3\u2032 direction) coding sequence.

                        "A Phage Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) selection for rapidly altering the DNA specificity of Cre recombinase towards a site present in a human genomic safe harbor locus, Rosa 26, was developed. The PACE experiments resulted in Cre variants capable of recombining a substrate with nearly 50% of the nucleotides altered compared to LoxP. We successfully used one of these variants to integrate exogenous DNA into the genome of unmodified human cells.",
                        "A Cre deletion-dependent Accessory Plasmid (AP) was generated (FIG. 2). Expression of the essential phage gene III (gIII) encoding the envelope protein III (pIII) is prevented by the strong transcriptional terminator rrnBT1, which is flanked by two Cre recombinase target sequences (LoxP sites). To lower background expression, the deletion cassette was placed internal to the gIII-encoding sequence. Recombination by Cre results in a deletion of the rrnBT1 terminator and thus to expression of gIII. Cells harboring the native AP do not express a functional gIII, and thus do not support the production of infectious phage particles. Upon Cre-mediated recombination, resulting in the deletion of the terminator, a functional gIII is reconstituted, thus enabling phage propagation.",
                        "In order to enable the evolution of recombinases based on the integration of two nucleic acid constructs comprising altered LoxP sites, a selection system was developed that comprises two cassettes, which, in their original state, do not confer expression of gIII to the host cells, but require integration via recombinase activity to reconstitute a functional expression construct encoding gIII (FIG. 2, lower panel). This selection strategy is useful for selecting recombinase activity based on the integration of two nucleic acid cassettes. The schematic in the lower panel of FIG. 2 shows two exemplary cassettes. Integration of these two constructs reconstitutes an intact gIII\u2014identical to the gene product resulting from recombining the plasmid in the upper panel of FIG. 2. The selection stringency can be tuned by choosing high or low copy origins for either plasmids, as well as altering the promoter or ribosomal binding site strength on the upstream plasmid.",
                        "In order to validate the selection strategy, a PACE experiment was performed with host cells harboring a recombinase-deletion-dependent AP as outlined in the upper panel of FIG2 with native LoxP sites and a selection phagemid encoding Cre (positive control). FIG. 3 shows that the Cre-selection phagemid propagated within the host cell population and could be retrieved from the lagoon. A second PACE experiment was performed with a selection phagemid encoding T7 RNA polymerase (negative control). The T7RNAP selection phagemid did not propagate and could not be retrieved from the lagoon. In order to test whether the PACE setup with the Cre deletion-dependent AP was able to enrich selection phagemid encoding a recombinase having the desired activity from a pool of phagemids with an excess of inactive members, a mixture of (active) Cre-encoding selection phagemid and (inactive) T7RNAP phagemid at a ratio of 1:1\u00d7106 was used in a third PACE experiment. As shown in FIG. 3, the PACE set up was able to enrich for Cre-SP within 12 hours.",
                        "In order to test whether inactive Cre proteins could be evolved to recognize the native LoxP site, a PACE experiment starting with the catalytically inactive K201N Cre mutant was carried out. The experiment included an initial 24 hr period in which the host cells were incubated under mutagenic conditions and gIII was provided from an inducible promoter and thus the selective pressure for functional Cre was removed. This initial period allowed mutagenesis and drift of the phagemid population. After the initial 24 hour period, selective pressure for functional Cre molecules was imposed by removing expression of gIII from the inducible promoter, so that any gIII expression had to be driven off the Cre deletion-dependent AP. FIG. 4 demonstrates that drift and selection can isolate multiple active Cre mutants from a catalytically inactive starting point. The recombinase activity of evolved Cre versions from several phagemid clones retrieved from the lagoon after selection was tested in a luciferase assay and compared to wild-type Cre and K201N Cre. The results demonstrate that multiple active forms of Cre recombinase were retrieved from the lagoon, including four that exhibited a reversion of the K201N mutation back to the wild-type K residue, and two that contained an activating N201D mutation.",
                        "As an evolutionary goal, a site present in the human Rosa26 locus was chosen. The Rosa 26 locus is considered a \u2018genomic safe harbor\u2019 locus that does not encode a protein, and allows transgenes to be inserted non-disruptively. The Rosa 26 locus further allows ubiquitous expression of inserted transgenes. See, e.g., Seidler, B. et al. 2008. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 10137. A site with few deviations from the native LoxP site was chosen, especially minimizing changes to important protein-DNA contacts.",
                        "The Rosa26 locus was searched for 34-base pair sequences with the fewest changes relative to the wild-type LoxP sequence using sequencing software. For example, the RosaLoxP7 site, as disclosed in FIG. 5 has 15 mismatches compared to the wild-type LoxP site. An initial list of candidate LoxP-like sites was compiled, and from this list, sites having the fewest substitutions at positions within the LoxP site known to be most important for Cre binding (B. Thyagarajan, Gene 244, 47 (2000). For example, wild-type Cre has been reported to feature a relatively strict requirement that the central dinucleotide (positions 17 and 18 in the LoxP site) be TA, so LoxP-like sites without these two nucleotides in these positions were disregarded as candidates for the initial screen.",
                        "Recombinases natively target sequences that are symmetric except for the core sequence. The target sequence in the Rosa locus, termed RosaLox, was asymmetric, however. To evolve Cre towards the asymmetric RosaLox site, the retargeting evolution strategy was split into left and right arcs, and the required changes in target DNA sequence from wild-type loxP to RosaLox were introduced step by step, as outlined in FIG. 5. The left and right arcs were evolved independently. Left-arc clones were evolved on the 7L1, L2, L3, and L4 substrates, while right-arc clones were evolved on the 7R1, R2, R3, and R4 substrates. The core or spacer region was evolved in parallel in both arcs. For example, the core sequence mutations in 7L1 were mimicked in 7R1, etc. (see FIG. 5, lower panel).",
                        "FIG. 6 illustrates the evolution of recombinases recognizing the L1 intermediate target sequence. Selection was initially started with a wild-type LoxP AP, then with a mix of wild-type LoxP and L1 target sequence APs, and then exclusively with an AP comprising the L1 target sequence. Various evolved clones were identified and their recombinase activity on wild-type LoxP and on L1 target sequences was assessed and compared to wild-type Cre recombinase via a luciferase assay.",
                        "After four rounds of evolution on the left arc, thus reaching evolved clones that could recognize the LF intermediate, the mutant clones exhibited between 12-15 mutations, including 9 converged positions (shown at left in FIG. 7). The mutations were enriched at the site of protein-DNA contacts where the nucleotide had changed (see insert). Several mutations clustered around the catalytic tyrosine. Similar results were obtained from the right arc workflow after reaching the RF intermediate. However, only 3 converged mutations were required for the RF intermediate, indicating a lower barrier to recombining the RF site. It was observed that both LF- and RF-evolved clones retained significant activity on the wild type LoxP site.",
                        "Clones from the LF arc could propagate in PACE on host cells containing the RosaLox AP. Further evolved clones had several new converged mutations, as well as 3-5 commonly mutated positions.",
                        "Using a newly developed mammalian plasmid-based reporter system, it was possible to measure activity on the RosaLox site in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Recombinase activity results in integration of both constructs to form a functional expression construct encoding YFP (FIG. 8). The bar graph in FIG. 9 shows data from the YFP integration reporter. Improved integration efficiency was observed with altered recombinase target sites, including the invRosa site, which comprises an inverted core.",
                        "A plasmid encoding RosaCre clone (36C6) was co-transfected with a plasmid carrying a RosaLox site and a neomycin resistance cassette. After two weeks of neomycin (G418) selection, only HEK293 cells that had been transfected with both plasmids survived .",
                        "In order to improve the specificity of the evolved recombinase clones, a negative PACE selection strategy was designed, linking unwanted recombinase activity (e.g., recognition of wild-type LoxP target sequences, to the production of the dominant negative pIIIneg (FIG. 10). The selection stringency can be adjusted by using different promoters, or by using an inducible promoter, such as the Tet-inducible promoter, and varying the dose of the inducer (e.g., anhydrotetracycline (ATc), tetracycline (Tc), or doxycycline (dox)). Results of an exemplary negative selection are illustrated in FIG. 11.",
                        "This negative selection system is useful to select against off-target activity and thus create more specific evolved Cre recombinases. In addition, such negative selection strategies can also be used to select against undesirable recombinase activity, e.g., against activity favoring the deletion of integrated genetic material. For example, recombination between the Rosa-Lox site and the invRosa site (having identical left and right half-sites as the Rosa-Lox site, but with an inverted core sequence) results in two non-identical sites, one of which is 7LF and one is 7RF. It is therefore possible, for example, to employ the selection strategies described herein to positively select for recombination between a Rosa-Lox and an invRosa-Lox site (simulating integration of a donor cassette into genomic DNA) and negatively select against recombining the RF and LF sites, simulating the possible reverse reaction (and thus deletion of inserted genomic material). The system could also be used to select for the opposite attributes (e.g., negative selection against integration and positive selection for deletion activity). The flexibility of the negative selection allows for screening out recombinase clones with unwanted activity on virtually any DNA substrate.",
                        "In order to assess the specificity of a recombinase, an in vitro method to measure the specificity of recombinases on randomized substrates in a library screening format was developed (FIG. 12). The PCR products resulting from recombined library members can be sequenced using high-throughput methodology in order to generate a recombinase specificity profile (FIG. 13).",
                        "Described here is one embodiment of a recombinase profiling workflow. Generally, the workflow involves three main steps: extension, recombinase treatment, and exonuclease treatment. The library oligos come in \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d versions (FIG. 12), and include a partially randomized (79% identity, 7% all other bases) recombinase target, as well as a 3\u2032 hairpin structure. For the extension step, the left and right oligos are separately extended from the hairpin across the randomized portion using Klenow exo(\u2212) DNA polymerase. This unique step allows replication of the randomized portion as a double-stranded oligo, with a hairpin on the left or right side.",
                        "Once the oligos are double stranded, they are valid substrates for a DNA recombinase. The purified recombinase protein (e.g., Cre) is mixed with equal amounts of the left and right library oligos and allowed to react for a given amount of time. Reaction progress can be optimized, for example to stop the recombinase reaction once 25%, 50% or 75% of the substrate has been consumed. The extent of the reaction can be determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR), amplifying with forward and reverse primers which each bind a separate oligo, and thus should only amplify across recombined substrates. The protein source can be commercially obtained or expressed in vitro (e.g., using the NEB PurExpress kit). The mixture is subsequently treated with exonucleases (e.g., T7 exonuclease, Exo 1, Exo 5, RecBCD, RecJ, ExoVIII, Lambda exo, etc.) to remove any unreacted oligos. In this sense, profiling methods described herein, in some embodiments, function as a selection modality for valid recombinase substrates. After exonuclease treatment, the material can be PCR amplified and prepared for high throughput sequencing (HTS) using standard procedures. FIGS. 14 and 15 depict PCR amplification of oligos selected in the presence and absence of Cre and BxB1 integrase, respectively.",
                        "This example describes 4 HTS experiments using Miseq v2 300 kits. Sequence logos were generated by comparing the post-selection abundance of DNA bases at each position in the lox site with the pre-selection (i.e., unreacted) abundance for each position. For example, in FIG. 16A, the canonical base at positions closest to the core are more enriched than the most distal 5 bases. This indicates that changes to the most distal bases are relatively unimportant when determining if a substrate is competent for recombination. Note the core sequence of LoxP site was held constant for these experiments, so no data is shown for the middle 8 bases. The overall specificity score is calculated by subtracting, from the enrichment factor of the correct base, the average of the enrichment of the three incorrect bases. The sequence logo depicted in FIG. 16A has an overall specificity score of 1.38. An alternative modality of presenting sequence logo data is provided in FIG. 23.",
                        "Collecting millions of sequencing reads allows the data to be searched for hidden trends. For example, FIGS. 16B-16J show sequence logos for a subset of sequences that have a mismatch at position 1 and position 34\u2014the first position from the right side. For the first 5 positions (FIGS. 16B-16F), there appears to be very little impact on the specificity score when a mismatch is found. This suggests a similar physical binding mode for all 5 distal bases. Relaxed specificity for the 5 distal bases is taken advantage of in the LE/RE directional recombination scheme, as confirmed by this data. Mutations at positions 6,7, and 9 (FIGS. 16G, 16H, and 16J) seem to have more of an effect on the site, but mutations at position 8 (FIG. 16I) are extremely rare in valid recombinase substrates. This agrees with crystallographic evidence that several residues (FIG. 17) make specific contacts at position 8. Table 1 shows examples of evolved CRE from the literature (e.g., as disclosed in Sarkar, I., Hauber, I., Hauber, J. & Buchholz, F. 2007. Science 316, 1912-5; Karpinski, J. et al. 2016. Nat. Biotechnol., online pre-print; and Santoro, S. W. & Schultz, P. G. 2002. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 4185-90). When these mutants were evolved on substrates with changes at position 8, they all mutated the residues implicated in contacting that position (e.g., position 8).",
                        "Parallel profiling experiments using two evolved Cre mutants, EV36C6 and EV42C4 were performed (FIG. 18). As shown in FIGS. 19-20, the mutants are less specific than Cre for the LoxP oligos, but more specific for the RosaLox oligos than Cre. The profiling also reveals that these two mutants have lost the strong preference at position 8 (FIG. 19), allowing them to recombine RosaLox but also making them more promiscuous. The profiling reveals that, when the substrates of the two mutant Cre's that contain 1 global mismatch are plotted, the mutant Cre's have an exaggerated reliance on binding positions 12 and 13 (FIG. 21), suggesting a unique binding mode for those two bases that has been conserved through our evolutions. Data indicates the exact residues that enforce specificity at nucleotides 12 and 13 are less clear than at position 8.",
                        "The relationship between a DNA-binding protein and its nucleic acid substrate is also investigated using specificity profiling. For example, in some embodiments, the question of how Cre binds its DNA is investigated by systematically mutating all of the residues in Cre that contact the DNA to alanines, and profiling the specificity of each single mutant. In some embodiments, the figure of reported Cre-DNA contacts from crystal structures provided by Buchholz and colleagues (Chem. Rev 2016) is used; most of the mutant residues are changed to alanines and then sequence logos are generated for each. In some embodiments, profiling methods described by the disclosure are used to determine the specificity for relatives of Cre (e.g., Flp, Dre, Tre and Brecl), which have been minimally studied. GinBeta (Barbas NAR 2010), phiC31, and BxB1 of the serine-recombinases can also be studied using profiling methods described by the disclosure.",
                        "Several of the above-noted recombinases (e.g., BxB1, Dre, phiC31, Flp) have been inserted into an SP vector and have been shown to be capable of surviving in PACE (FIG. 22). The selections for each are analogous to that of Cre, with the cognate recombinase target swapped out for LoxP in the APs. The selections were carried out on the wt substrate for each recombinase. However, such recombinases could also be evolved on new substrates.",
