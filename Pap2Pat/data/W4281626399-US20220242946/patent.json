Consequently, IL-2 responsiveness is determined by the IL-2R\u03b1 subunit, which is highly expressed on TRegS, but virtually absent from na\u00efve Effs, rendering TRegS 100-fold more sensitive to IL-2 (see, e.g., Boyman et al., Nat Rev Immunol. 12(3):180-90 (2012); Malek, Annu Rev Immunol. 26:45379 (2008); and Spangler et al., Annu Rev Immunol. 33:139-67 (2015)).

For example, provided herein are single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3yc polypeptide complex. In some cases, a single-chain immunocytokine that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can include (e.g., can be designed to include) an immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC), an IL-2 polypeptide (or fragment thereof) that can bind an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex, and an immunoglobulin light chain (LC). Also provided herein are methods for making and using single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex. For example, a composition containing one or more single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can be administered to a mammal in need thereof (e.g., a mammal having a condition that can benefit from reducing or eliminating an immune response within the mammal such as an autoimmune disease and/or transplant rejection) to treat the mammal. In some cases, a composition containing one or more single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can be administered to a mammal to stimulate TRegS within the mammal (e.g., to reduce or eliminate an immune response such as an autoimmune response in that mammal).

The ability to stimulate immune TRegS (e.g., but not Effs) provides unique and unrealized targeted cytokine therapies that can safely and selectively reduce or eliminate pathogenic autoimmunity and/or transplant rejection in a mammal (e.g., a human), and can be used to treat a mammal having an autoimmune disease and/or having, or at risk of developing, transplant rejection.",

                        "This document provides methods and materials for targeted expansion of TRegS. For example, provided herein are single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex. In some cases, a single-chain immunocytokine that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can include (e.g., can be designed to include) an immunoglobulin heavy chain, an IL-2 polypeptide (or fragment thereof) that can bind an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex, and an immunoglobulin light chain. Also provided herein are methods for making and using single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex. For example, a composition containing one or more single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can be administered to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need thereof (e.g., a mammal having a condition that can benefit from reducing or eliminating an immune response within the mammal such as an autoimmune disease and/or transplant rejection) to treat the mammal. In some cases, a composition containing one or more single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can be administered to a mammal to stimulate TRegS within the mammal (e.g., to reduce or eliminate an immune response such as an autoimmune response in that mammal). For example, a composition containing one or more single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can be administered to a mammal having an autoimmune disease to treat the mammal. For example, a composition containing one or more single-chain immunocytokines that can bind to an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex can be administered to a mammal having, or at risk of developing, transplant rejection to treat the mammal. As used herein, a single-chain immunocytokine described herein (e.g., a single-chain immunocytokine that can bind an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex) is a fusion protein that includes a cytokine fused (e.g., genetically fused) to antibody or a fragment thereof (e.g., a cytokine/antibody fusion protein). In some cases, a single-chain immunocytokine described herein can include a cytokine fused to an anti-cytokine antibody or a fragment thereof (e.g., an anti-IL-2 antibody or a fragment thereof). In some cases, a single-chain immunocytokine described herein can include a cytokine that is fused to an antibody such that the cytokine and antibody bind intramolecularly within the immunocytokine. In some cases, a single-chain immunocytokine described herein can include a cytokine that is fused to one or more ends of an antibody (e.g., the N- or C-terminus of an antibody heavy chain and/or the N- or C-terminus of an antibody light chain). For example, a single-chain immunocytokine can be an amino acid chain that includes (e.g., is designed to include) an immunoglobulin heavy chain, an IL-2 polypeptide (or fragment thereof) that can bind an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex, and an immunoglobulin light chain. In some cases, a single-chain immunocytokine described herein can be a fusion polypeptide that includes a cytokine fused to at least a portion (e.g., an immunoglobulin heavy chain and/or an immunoglobulin light chain) of an anti-cytokine antibody. For example, a single-chain immunocytokine described herein can be a fusion polypeptide that includes an immunoglobulin heavy chain (e.g., an immunoglobulin heavy chain from an anti-cytokine antibody) fused to an IL-2 polypeptide (or fragment thereof) that can bind an IL-2R\u03b1/IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c polypeptide complex fused to an immunoglobulin light chain (e.g., an immunoglobulin light chain from an anti-cytokine antibody).",

An immunoglobulin heavy chain can be from any appropriate immunoglobulin. In some cases, the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain and the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domains can be from the same immunoglobulin.

                        "In some cases, the autoimmune disease present within a mammal, and/or the severity of one or more symptoms of the autoimmune disease being treated can be monitored. For example, the presence of autoantibodies present within a mammal being treated can be monitored. Any appropriate method can be used to determine whether or not the level of autoantibodies present within a mammal is reduced.",

The heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) of the F5111 antibody were separately cloned into the gWiz vector (Genlantis). Antibodies were expressed recombinantly in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells via transient co-transfection of plasmids encoding the HC and LC. HC and LC plasmids were titrated in small-scale co-transfection tests to determine optimal ratios for large-scale expression. Secreted antibodies were purified from cell supernatants 5 days post-transfection via protein G affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) on an FPLC instrument, equilibrated in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 150 mM NaCl in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3). Purity (>99%) was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. For IC production, the hIL-2 cytokine was fused to the full F5111 antibody at the N-terminus of the LC, connected by either a flexible 15-amino acid (Gly4Ser)3 linker (F5111 IC LN15, SEQ ID NO:3), 25-amino acid (Gly4Ser)5 linker (F5111 IC LN25, SEQ ID NO:24), or a 35-amino acid (Gly4Ser)7 linker (F5111 IC LN35, SEQ ID NO:25) to allow for intramolecular interaction. Separate plasmids were prepared in the gWiz vector (Genlantis) encoding the F5111 HC and the hIL-2-fused F5111 LC.

It was further shown that IL-2/F5111 complex treatment reduces T1D severity in mice (Trotta et al., Nat Med. 24(7):1005-1014 (2018)). This exciting targeted IL-2 therapy holds vast clinical potential, but therapeutic development of a mixed cytokine/antibody complex is limited by dosing ratio considerations and complex instability. In fact, dissociation of the complex could induce dangerous toxicities from the free cytokine and potentially even exacerbate autoimmune pathogenesis by activating autoreactive effector T cells. Moreover, the free cytokine clears in <5 minutes from the bloodstream (Donohue et al., J Immunol. 130(5):2203-2208 (1983)).",

The full hIL-2 cytokine was fused to the full-length F5111 human IgG1 lambda antibody at the LC N-terminus, connected by a flexible 15-amino acid (Gly4Ser)3 linker. This will be referred to as F5111 IC LN15. A rapid small-scale HEK 293F cell transfection assay was used to optimize immunocytokine expression. Cells were transfected in 6-well plates with predefined ratios of heavy chain (HC) and IL-2-fused light chain (LC) plasmid DNA. After a 3-day incubation, secreted protein was captured from the supernatant with protein G resin, eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.0, and analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Titration of the HC:LC ratio revealed the optimal expression conditions. Immunocytokine expression was scaled up in HEK 293F cells and the secreted protein was purified via protein G affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. The process described above was also performed for expression of the recombinant F5111 antibody. F5111 antibody and F5111 IC LN15 were purified to homogeneity on an FPLC instrument (FIG. 2A), and purity (>99%) was verified via SDS-PAGE analysis (FIG. 2B). To verify binding of the recombinant F5111 antibody to the target hIL-2 cytokine, soluble antibody was titrated binding to yeast-displayed hIL-2 or mIL-2. As expected, the antibody bound hIL-2 with an apparent bivalent affinity of KD=420 pM. The antibody did not cross react with mIL-2 (FIG. 3)."

For both yeast surface and bio-layer interferometry studies, a significant reduction in binding affinity was observed for F5111 IC LN15 relative to F5111 Ab, confirming intramolecular cytokine/antibody assembly. Bio-layer interferometry based binding studies were also conducted to assess the interaction between F5111 IC LN15 and the IL-2R\u03b1 and IL-2R\u03b2 receptor chains, to ensure that the single-chain antibody/cytokine fusion was biased toward engagement of IL-2R\u03b1 (which is highly expressed on TReg cells but not effector cells) compared with IL-2R\u03b2. Indeed, biophysical assessment showed that F5111 IC LN15 bound IL-2R\u03b1 with equal potency to the free IL-2 cytokine (FIG. 5A), whereas F5111 IC LN15 exhibited significantly impaired binding to IL-2R\u03b2 relative to the free IL-2 cytokine (FIG. 5B).

Alternative F5111 IC constructs were designed substituting the 15-amino acid linker with longer linkers, including a 25-amino acid linker (F5111 IC LN25) and a 35-amino acid linker (F5111 IC LN35). Expression of F5111 IC LN25 and LN35 was carried out in HEK 293F cells via transient co-transfection of plasmids encoding the F5111 heavy chain and the IL-2-fused F5111 light chain. The protein was purified from cell supernatants via protein G affinity chromatography followed by SEC on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) instrument. Three peaks were observed by SEC analysis for both F5111 IC LN25 and LN35 (labeled P1, P2, P3), and each peak was pooled for analysis. It was expected that since P1 and P2 elute earlier from the SEC column, they contain higher order oligomeric structures, whereas P3 represents the monomeric F5111 IC LN35 (FIG. 7A). The SEC traces for F5111 IC LN25 and LN35 were compared to the SEC trace for F5111 IC LN15 (FIG. 7B). As seen in FIG. 7B, most of the produced the F5111 IC LN15 was oligomerized, demonstrated by its coincident elution with P1 and P2 of F5111 IC LN25 and LN35 from the SEC column. Furthermore, P3 of F5111 IC LN25 and LN35 eluted at a volume close to the molecular weight of an antibody, suggesting that this peak consists of the monomeric IC. Therefore, P3 was used for evaluation in further experiments with F5111 IC LN25 and LN35, and all subsequent references to F5111 IC LN25 and LN35 represent P3 unless otherwise specified. F5111 IC LN35 contained overall less oligomer compared to F5111 IC LN25. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed to verify purity (FIG. 7C).",
