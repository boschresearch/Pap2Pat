                        "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy in the United States. Despite the recent advances in targeted therapy in different types of cancer, platinum based therapies such as cisplatin remain the standard of care for EOC patients. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that ovarian cancer is composed of multiple separate diseases. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common subtype (>70% of EOC cases) and accounts for the majority of EOC-associated mortalities. Although many patients initially respond to cisplatin, the majority of these patients become resistant and the mechanism of this resistance is not fully understood. Epigenetic regulation has been shown to play an important role in tumor progression and specifically in the development of platinum therapy resistance. Thus, it is important to identify epigenetic factors that are responsible for cisplatin resistance in EOC.",
                        "SWI/SNF (Switch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) is a chromatin remodeling complex that is often dysregulated in different types of cancer. The activity of the SWI/SNF complex is tightly regulated and multiple subunits of SWI/SNF are post-translationally modified. BAF155, one of the subunits of SWI/SNF complex, is methylated by coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), also known as protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4). This modification has been shown to enhance tumor progression and metastasis. Wang, et al., Cancer Cell, 2014, 25, 21-36. CARM1 has been shown to methylate substrates involved in epigenetic chromatin remodeling. This suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in CARM1-expressing cancers. Interestingly, the CARM1 gene is amplified in 10% of high-grade ovarian cancer patients and CARM1 amplification is associated with poor prognosis in EOC patients.",
                        "Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a multiprotein complex that negatively regulates the expression of large numbers of genes by generating a silencing histone modification (H3K27me3) through its catalytic subunit enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Many of the genes regulated by PRC2 are involved in cancer progression, and dysregulation of PRC2 function is observed in many different types of cancer including EOC. Recent studies have shown that SWI/SNF and PRC2 complexes play an antagonistic role in tumorigenesis. Wilson, et al., Cancer Cell 2010, 184, 316-328. EZH2 is highly expressed in many cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma, and is frequently associated with tumor progression and poor outcomes. Furthermore, mutated forms of EZH2, including somatic heterozygous mutations of the Y641 and A677 residues of the catalytic SET domain, are observed in some cancers including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma. Morin, et al., Nature 2011, 476, 298-303; Ryan, et al. PLoS ONE 2011, 6, e28585; Morin, et al., Nature Genet. 2010, 42, 181-185.",
                        "A number of selective small molecule EZH2 inhibitors have been identified and progressed into clinical development. Momparler and C\u00f4t\u00e9, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2015, 24, 1031-43; Melnick, Cancer Cell 2012, 22, 569-70. EZH2 inhibitors are currently being investigated for the treatment of cancers exhibiting overexpression of EZH2, including B cell lymphomas such as DLBCL, Germinal center B-cell DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, INI1-negative tumors, synovial sarcoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and other solid tumors. For example, the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) has potent activity against EZH2-mutated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Knutson, et al., Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2014, 13, 842-854.",
                        "The present invention provides the unexpected finding that EZH2 inhibitors may be used to effectively treat cancers that overexpress CARM1. The present invention further provides the unexpected finding that combinations of EZH2 inhibitors and platinum-based antineoplastic agents are surprisingly effective in the treatment of any of several subtypes of cancers, such as solid tumor cancers, wherein a biological sample exhibits CARM1 overexpression."

                                "The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and salicylic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese and aluminum. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins. Specific examples include isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. The term \u201ccocrystal\u201d refers to a molecular complex derived from a number of cocrystal formers. Unlike a salt, a cocrystal typically does not involve hydrogen transfer between the cocrystal and the drug, and instead involves intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, aromatic ring stacking, or dispersive forces, between the cocrystal former and the drug in the crystal structure.",

Thus, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers the advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1985). The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also intended to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to yield the active parent compound. Prodrugs include, for example, compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetates, formates and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol, various ester derivatives of a carboxylic acid, or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound.",

Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient(s) into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient(s) with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.",

These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g., transdermal application), via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. The active pharmaceutical ingredient or combination of active pharmaceutical ingredients can also be administered intrathecally.",
                                "The compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for example, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly(ether-ester) copolymers (e.g., PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g., polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. The active pharmaceutical ingredient or combination of active pharmaceutical ingredients may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. The active pharmaceutical ingredient or combination of active pharmaceutical ingredients may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of an active pharmaceutical ingredient or combination of active pharmaceutical ingredients via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.",

High CARM1 expression predicts a shorter survival in ovarian cancer patients. Inhibition of EZH2 activity using a clinically applicable small molecule inhibitor significantly suppressed the growth of CARM1-expressing, but not CARM1 deficient, ovarian tumors in two xenograft models and improved the survival of mice bearing CARM1-expressing tumors. The observed selectivity correlates with upregulation of EZH2 target genes in a CARM1-dependent manner. CARM1 promotes EZH2 dependent gene silencing of EZH2/BAF155 target tumor suppressor genes by methylating BAF155 to alter the antagonism between EZH2 and BAF155.

Nature (2011) 474:609-15). Consistently, CARM1 was expressed at a higher level in laser capture and microdissected HGSOCs compared with normal human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells (FIG. 15) (Mok et al. Cancer Cell (2009) 16:521-532). In addition, recent evidence indicates that the majority of HGSOC likely develops from the fallopian tube fimbriae epithelium (FTE) (see, e.g., Bowtell et al. Nat Rev Cancer (2015) 15:668-79 and Dubeau et al. Ann Oncol. (2013) 24 Suppl 8, viii28-viii35). Indeed, CARM1 was also expressed at a higher level in laser capture and microdissected HGSOCs compared with normal human fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells (FIG. 16) (Tone et al. Clin Cancer Res. (2008) 14:4067-78). Likewise, CARM1 was expressed at higher levels in a number of EOC cell lines compared with either FTE or HOSE cells (FIG. 17). Interestingly, CARM1 amplification and BRCA1/2 mutations do not typically occur in the same tumor (FIG. 14) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research N. Nature (2011) 474:609-15). Consistent with its oncogenic role in EOC, CARM1 amplification or high expression predicted a shorter overall survival in TCGA HGSOC database and an independent EOC patient cohort based on gene expression profiling (FIGS. 18 and 19). Thus, CARM1 is amplified in EOC, and its amplification/high expression correlates with a poor overall survival in EOC patients.",

Consistent with CARM1's growth-promoting role reported in other cancer types (Yang et al.

                                "CARM1 asymmetrically dimethylates substrates involved in epigenetic gene transcription (Yang et al. Nat Rev Cancer (2013) 13:37-50). This suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in mediating the oncogenic activity of CARM1. Thus, an unbiased evaluation was performed of a set of 23 small molecule epigenetic inhibitors (Bitler et al. Nature Medicine (2015) 21:231-8). Each individual inhibitor was evaluated for its ability to selectively suppress the growth of CARM1-expressing cells compared with CARM1 KO cells. Interestingly, both of the EZH2 inhibitors in the set (namely GSK126 and UNC1999) showed selectivity against CARM1-expressing cells (FIGS. 26 and 27) (see, e.g., McCabe et al. Nature (2012) 492:108-12 and Konze et al. ACS Chem Biol. (2013) 8: 1324-34). This is not due to a reduced proliferation of CARM KO cells because: (1) a number of small molecule inhibitors were equally effective in suppressing the growth of both CARM-expressing and KO cells (e.g., CI994, FIG. 28); and (2) the data was normalized to the growth of vehicle-treated CARM1-expressing or KO cells to control for variation in cell growth. The observed CARM1-dependent selectivity by EZH2 inhibitors was not due to changes in EZH2 levels because its expression was not altered and levels of its enzymatic product H3K27Me3 were not changed by CARM1 knockout (FIG. 29). However, EZH2 is overexpressed in CARM-high primary HGSOC and cell lines compared to either HOSE cells or FTE cells (FIGS. 17, 30, and 31) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research N. Nature (2011) 474: 609-15 and Tone et al. Clin Cancer Res. (2008) 14:4067-78).",
                                "These studies focus on GSK126. It was determined that 10 \u03bcM GSK126 was sufficient to inhibit >95% of the enzymatic activity of EZH2 as indicated by the decrease in H3K27Me3 levels (FIG. 32). Note that EZH2 inhibition did not affect the expression of CARM1 (FIG. 32). GSK126 did not affect EZH2 protein levels but instead selectively inhibited its methyltransferase activity as evidenced by a dose-dependent decrease in H3K27Me3 levels (FIG. 32). Thus, a concentration of 10 \u03bcM GSK126 was used for subsequent studies. Validating the pharmacological screen, there was a correlation between CARM1 expression levels and cellular response to GSK126 in a panel of EOC cell lines (FIGS. 17, 33, and 34). Notably, GSK126 did not affect the growth of either HOSE or FTE cells (FIG. 33). Similar results were obtained in CARM1-high parental and CARM1 KO cells in both conventional 2D and 3D cultures using Matrigel extracellular matrix (FIGS. 35 and 36). EZH2 is expressed at comparable levels in normal controls and CARM1-low EOC cells that did not respond to GSK126 such as CAOV3 and PEO1 (FIGS. 17 and 33), indicating that the observed selectivity was not due to EZH2 upregulation alone. Consistent with the observed growth inhibition, markers of apoptosis were induced by EZH2 inhibition in a CARM1-dependent manner (e.g., FIGS. 37, 38, and 39A). These data point to sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors as a unique and exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in CARM1-high EOCs.",
                                "To limit the potential off-target effects and validate that the observed effects were due to inhibition of EZH2's methyltransferase activity, genetic rescue experiments were performed. Indeed, apoptosis induced by EZH2 knockdown could be rescued by wild-type EZH2 but not by a mutant with inactivated catalytic activity (FIGS. 40 and 41). Consistently, the cell growth inhibition induced by EZH2 knockdown was rescued by wild-type EZH2 but not by a catalytically inactive EZH2 mutant (FIGS. 42 and 43). Evidence suggests that EZH2 inhibitor can also affect cell growth by destabilizing PRC2 complex in a catalytic activity-independent manner. Notably, the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 did not weaken the interaction between PRC2 subunits EZH2 and SUZ12 (FIG. 39B), supporting the notion that the observed selectivity against CARM1 was not due to destabilization of PRC2 complex. Together, and without being limited to any one theory, it has been concluded that the observed selectivity against CARM1 by EZH2 inhibitor is due to inhibition of its methyltransferase activity.",

                                "To explore the mechanistic basis of the selectivity against EZH2 inhibitor, RNA-deep sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed in parental control and CARM1 KO cells (FIG. 44). To identify direct EZH2 target genes that are regulated by CARM1, EZH2 and H3K27Me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis in control and CARM1 KO cells (FIG. 44). Since CARM1 may promote EZH2-dependent gene silencing, the genomic loci were focused upon that showed a decrease in association with EZH2/H3K27Me3 in CARM1 KO cells compared with controls (e.g., FIGS. 44 and 45). Cross-referencing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data (GEO access number: GSE95645) revealed a list of 218 direct EZH2/H3K27Me3 target genes that were downregulated by CARM1 (>3-fold) (FIGS. 44, 46, and 47). This represents a 8.3-fold enrichment of EZH2/H3K27Me3 target genes among the 2084 genes upregulated at least 3-fold in CARM1 KO cells compared with parental controls (P=1.5\u00d710\u2212136) (FIG. 48). Finally, the list of 218 direct EZH2/H3K27Me3 target genes were cross-referenced with 528 TCGA high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas gene expression profiles and identified genes that negatively correlated with CARM1 expression in these cases (FIG. 44). These prioritizations led to a list of 36 EZH2 direct target genes that negatively correlated with CARM1 expression (FIG. 44). Pathway analysis revealed that the top functional pathway enriched in these genes was apoptosis (n=19, P=2.6\u00d710\u22126) (FIGS. 44 and 49). Notably, three of the ranked apoptosis-regulating genes (DAB2 (He et al. J Boil Chem. (2001) 276:26814-8), DLC1 (Barras et al. Cancer Metastasis Rev. (2014) 33:87-100 and Zhou et al. Oncogene (2004) 23:1308-13) and NOXA (Ploner et al. Oncogene (2008) 27 Suppl 1: S84-92)) were known tumor suppressors that are implicated in suppressing proliferation and promoting apoptosis (FIG. 45), i.e., the phenotypes observed when CARM1 was knocked out or EZH2 activity was inhibited with GSK126 (see, e.g., FIGS. 15-21, 26, and 28-31).",
                                "In parallel, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed for the upstream transcription factor that regulates the genes differentially expressed in parental control and CARM1 KO cells. The top upstream transcription regulator identified was the SMARCA4 (also known as BRG1), the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex (P=1.22\u00d710\u221230) (FIGS. 50 and 51). Notably, inhibition of EZH2 activity is known to be synthetically lethal with inactivation of the SWI/SNF complex due to antagonistic regulation of the same set of genes by the EZH2/PRC2 and the SWI/SNF complexes (Kadoch et al. Sci Adv. (2015) 1: e1500447). CARM1 methylates the R1064 residue of BAF155, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF complex (Wang et al. Cancer Cell (2014) 25: 21-36). Indeed, the observed changes in selectivity against CARM1 KO or knockdown cells correlated with the decrease in R1064 methylated BAF155 (BAF155Me) levels (see FIGS. 50, 52, and 53). However, EZH2 inhibition did not affect BAF155Me levels (FIG. 54). Together, these data suggest that CARM1 may promote EZH2-mediated silencing by altering the antagonism between PRC2 and SWI/SNF complex via BAF155Me.",
                                "CARM1 Regulates Antagonism Between BAF155 and EZH2 by Methylating BAF155.",
                                "A validation study was first performed to determine whether the identified genes were regulated by CARM1 and EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. Indeed, the expression of the identified genes was upregulated by either EZH2 inhibition by GSK126 treatment or CARM1 knockout or knockdown (FIGS. 55 and 56). Notably, GSK126 treatment and CARM1 knockout did not appear to have additive effects on the expression of these genes (FIG. 55), indicating that they probably function in the same pathway to regulate the expression of these genes. As a control, known CARM1-regulated BAF155Me target genes such as the tumor suppressor TIMP3 (Wang et al. Cancer Cell (2014) 25: 21-36) were downregulated by CARM KO but not by EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 (FIG. 57). This supports the notion that CARM1 promotes the silencing of EZH2/BAF155 target genes but mediates the expression of CARM1-regulated BAF155Me targeted genes in an EZH2-independent manner. Our results also suggest that EZH2 does not regulate BAF155Me target genes.",
                                "ChIP analysis validated that the association of EZH2 and its enzymatic product H3K27Me3 with these gene loci was indeed CARM1-dependent (FIGS. 58 and 59). EZH2 inhibitor decreased H3K27Me3 occupancy without affecting EZH2's association with its target genes (FIGS. 58 and 59). Importantly, CARM1 KO led to loss of EZH2 from these target gene loci and a corresponding increase in the association of BAF155 with these gene loci (FIG. 60). This result indicates that there is a switch from EZH2 to unmethylated BAF155 in these gene loci when CARM1 is knocked out. Finally, the association of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with the gene loci correlated with changes in their expression (FIGS. 55 and 61). In contrast, there was no significant enrichment of either EZH2 or H3K27Me3 in the promoter of the CARM1-regulated BAF155Me target genes such as TIMP3 (Wang et al. Cancer Cell (2014) 25: 21-36) (FIGS. 62 and 63). CARM1 KO but not EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 treatment decreased the association of BAF155 and Pol II with the TIMP3 promoter (FIGS. 64 and 65). Since the antibody against BAF155Me was not suitable for ChIP analysis, BAF155Me occupancy of target genes could not be directly examined. Nevertheless, the data support a model that CARM1 promotes the silencing of EZH2/BAF155 target genes by displacing BAF155 via methylation, which then permits the occupancy of the target gene promoters by EZH2 and their consequent repression by H3K27Me3 (FIG. 66). In contrast, CARM1 mediates the expression of CARM1-regulated BAF155Me targeted genes in an EZH2-independent manner (FIG. 66). Thus, CARM1 regulates the antagonism between SWI/SNF and PRC2 through methylating BAF155 (FIG. 66).",
                                "The effects of CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation at the R1064 residue on the expression of identified EZH2/BAF155 target genes were then tested to establish that the observed antagonism is BAF155Me dependent. Toward this goal, in CARM1-high A1847 cells, endogenous BAF155 were replaced with either mutant BAF155 that can no longer be methylated by CARM1 (BAF155R1064K) or wild-type BAF155 (FIG. 67). Indeed, BAF155 R1064K mutant but not wild-type BAF155 upregulated the expression of the EZH2/BAF155 target genes (FIG. 68), indicating that only the unmethylated BAF155 can be associated with these genes. This correlated with a decrease in EZH2 and its enzymatic product H3K27Me3 at the promoter of these genes and a concurrent increase of BAF155's association with these gene promoters (FIGS. 69 and 70). In contrast, the association of BAF155 with the BAF155Me target gene TIMP3 was rescued by wild-type BAF155 but not the BAF155 R1064K, which correlated with the suppression of TIMP3 by BAF155 R1046K but not wild-type BAF155 (FIGS. 72A and 72B). Together, these data further support the notion that CARM1-mediated methylation of BAF155 drives a switch from BAF155 to EZH2 at the promoters of the BAF155/EZH2 target tumor suppressor genes (FIG. 66). Therefore, EZH2 inhibition reactivates the tumor suppressive BAF155/EZH2 target genes to promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of CARM1-expressing cells (FIG. 66).",

                                "EZH2 inhibitors, such as GSK126, are used safely in clinical trials for hematopoietic malignancies (Ribrag et al. Eur J Cancer (2014) 50:197). To determine the effects of EZH2 inhibition in vivo on the growth of CARM1-expressing ovarian tumors, two xenograft models were utilized. In the subcutaneous xenograft models, the injected CARM1-expressing A1847 cells were first allowed to grow for one week to establish the tumors. Mice were then randomized and treated daily with vehicle control or GSK126 (50 mg/kg) by intraperitioneal (i.p.) injection as reported (see, e.g., Bitler et al. Nature Medicine (2015) 21:231-8 and McCabe et al. Nature (2012) 492:108-12). Indeed, GSK126 treatment significantly inhibited the growth of CARM1-expressing tumors (FIGS. 73 and 74). In contrast, GSK126 treatment failed to inhibit the growth of tumors formed by CARM1 knockout A1847 cells (FIG. 75). To more closely mimic the tumor microenvironment, A1847 cells were orthotopically transplanted into the bursa covering the ovary of immunocompromised NSG mice. Similarly, the injected cells were first allowed to grow for one week to establish the tumors. Mice were then randomized and treated daily with vehicle control or GSK126 (50 mg/kg) by intraperitioneal (i.p.) injection. Similar to what was observed in subcutaneous xenograft models, the growth of CARM1-expressing tumors was significantly inhibited by GSK126 in the orthotopic xenograft models (FIGS. 76 and 77). The survival of the treated mice was followed after stopping the treatment regimens. Importantly, GSK126 significantly improved the survival of mice bearing the orthotopically-transplanted CARM1-expressing tumors compared to controls (FIG. 78) (P=0.0023). Thus, the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 was found to significantly suppress the growth of CARM1-expressing tumors and improved the survival of mice bearing these tumors.",
                                "The observed tumor growth suppression in vivo was correlated with the molecular pathways underlying the CARM1-dependent effects of EZH2 inhibition. To do so, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed for markers of cell proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3), H3K27Me3 and EZH2. H3K27Me3 staining was decreased by GSK126, while GSK126 did not affect EZH2 staining (FIGS. 79 and 80). Further, GSK126 treatment decreased the expression of Ki67 and increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 (FIGS. 79 and 80). Finally, the observed decrease in cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis correlated with the upregulation of the identified CARM1-regulated EZH2/BAF155 target genes such as DAB2, DLC1 and NOXA by the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 in vivo (FIG. 81). In contrast, GSK126 did not affect the expression of Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 in tumors formatted by CARM1 knockout cells despite the reduction of H3K27Me3 by GSK126 (FIGS. 82 and 83). Likewise, GSK126 did not increase the expression of the identified CARM1 regulated EZH2/BAF155 target genes in tumors formed by CARM1 knockout cells (FIG. 84). Together, these data support a model that EZH2 inhibition suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis in CARM1-expressing tumors by upregulating the EZH2/BAF155 target genes through regulating the antagonism between EZH2 (PRC2) and BAF155 (SWI/SNF) (FIG. 85).",
                                "Discussion",
                                "The foregoing data demonstrates a dependence of CARM1-expressing cells on EZH2 activity, reflecting the silencing of EZH2 target tumor suppressor genes in a CARM1-dependent manner. Mechanistically, CARM1 regulates the antagonism between EZH2 and BAF155 to drive the silencing of EZH2/BAF155 target tumor suppressor genes, which promotes apoptosis and inhibits proliferation. Specifically, CARM1-mediated methylation of BAF155 leads to the switch from BAF155 to EZH2 at the promoters of the EZH2/BAF155 target genes. Indeed, inhibition of EZH2 activity by clinically applicable small molecule restored the expression of the EZH2/BAF155 target genes. Thus, CARM1 regulates the antagonism between the BAF155-containing SWI/SNF complex and the EZH2-containing PRC2 complex by methylating BAF155. In addition, CARM1-mediated methylation of BAF155 leads to the distribution of BAF155 to the BAF155Me target genes such as TIMP3 in an EZH2-independent manner. Without being limited to any one theory, this suggests that CARM1 functions to promote the expression of BAF155Me target genes while epigenetically silencing EZH2/BAF155 target genes through EZH2 mediated H3K27Me3.",
                                "CARM1 plays a context-dependent role in cancer. Whereas the prevailing data support an overall oncogenic role of CARM1 in cancers, emerging evidence indicates that CARM1 may also positively regulate the activity of tumor suppressors (Wang et al. Mol Cell (2016) 64:673-87) and promote the expression of tumor suppressor genes such as TIMP3 through BAF155Me (Wang et al. Cancer Cell (2014) 25:21-36). Thus, directly targeting CARM1 may have unintended tumor-promoting effects. In addition, CARM1 is specifically required for postnatal survival (Yadav et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (2003) 100:6464-8). Together, these caveats suggest that directly targeting CARM1 may not be a valid therapeutic strategy. In contrast, the foregoing data demonstrates that EZH2 inhibition can suppress the growth of CARM1-expressing tumors and improves survival of tumor bearing mice. This correlates with reactivation of EZH2-mediated silencing of tumor suppressor genes implicated in promoting apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation. Thus, targeting EZH2 activity may be advantageous compared to inhibition of CARM1 activity.",
                                "Analysis of HGSOC patients from TCGA revealed that CARM1 is amplified in \u02dc10% and overexpressed in an additional \u02dc10% of spontaneous HGSOC. In comparison, somatic BRCA1/2 mutations occur in \u02dc3-4% of these cases for each gene that are among the most commonly mutated genes in HGSOC. Interestingly, CARM1 amplification does not typically occur in HGSOC with mutations in BRCA1/2. Thus, there is an even greater need for developing therapeutic approaches that correlate with CARM1 status. This is because platinum-based chemotherapy, the current standard of care, and emerging treatment with PARP inhibitors are typically more effective in patients with BRCA1/2 inactivation. In view of the foregoing, CARM1 overexpression and/or amplification may serve as a predictive marker for further development of EZH2 inhibitors as a therapy in treating epithelial ovarian cancer.",
                                "In summary, this example demonstrates that targeting EZH2 methyltrasferase activity through the use of EZH2 inhibitors in CARM1-expressing cells represents a viable therapeutic strategy. Notably, EZH2 inhibitors such as GSK126 are well-tolerated with limited toxicity in clinical trials for hematopoietic malignancies. Thus, the studies described herein provide a scientific rationale for using applicable EZH2 inhibitors for CARM1-expressing cancers, such as CARM1-expressing ovarian cancers, for which novel therapeutics are urgently needed. Given that CARM1 overexpression is frequently observed in many different cancer types, the foregoing findings have far-reaching implications for improving therapy for an array of cancer types."
