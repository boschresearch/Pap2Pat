                        "Summarization systems are used to provide short summaries of text articles. For example, summarization of text content provides a relatively brief overview of an article to an end user. In some cases, summarization of text saves time for the end user. In addition, summarization systems that utilize machine learning techniques rapidly provide text summaries for large volumes of text documents. For example, some conventional summarization systems use neural networks to rapidly summarize news articles, webpage comments, or other sources of text documents. However, present techniques for text summarization do not account for affective preferences, such as psychological or linguistic preferences, of a user. For example, a business person having an affective preference for formality may prefer text summaries with more formal language, while a teenager having an affective preference for casualness may prefer text summaries with more informal language or slang.",
                        "In some cases, a summary generated by a conventional summarization system includes language that irritates or confuses a user who has a particular affective preference. In addition, a non-affective text summary results in relatively poor user comprehension or user engagement with the non-affective text summary. Some conventional summarization systems modify an existing text summary to accommodate user preference, such as by substituting terms in a previously generated summary. However, conventional systems for modifying summaries do not account for affective preference during the generation of the text summary."

                        "As discussed above, prior techniques for summarizing text do not account for affective preference in the generation of a text summary. In some cases, a non-affective text summary causes relatively poor user comprehension or user engagement with the non-affective text summary, while an affective text summary improves user comprehension and enjoyment. In addition, conventional summarization systems do not generate multiple summaries based on various affective preferences. Since affective preferences vary with users, it is beneficial to develop techniques for summarizing text based on an affect or affective preference. In some cases, generating multiple affective text summaries that are tailored to a variety of affective preferences improves accessibility of the summaries, such as to multiple groups of users with different preferences.",
                        "Certain embodiments described herein address the shortcomings of conventional summarization systems by providing affective text summaries generated based on respective affect levels. For example, a particular affective text summary is tailored to a target affect level, such as a level of formality that is a preference of a particular user. The described embodiments allow, for example, improved comprehension of the affective text summary by a user. Additionally or alternatively, the described embodiments provide improved personalization of summaries provided to a user, such as by incorporating the user's affective preferences.",
                        "In some cases, conventional summarization systems include neural networks that are configured to provide a non-affective text summary. Such conventional systems can provide, for example, summarizations of numerous text documents. Embodiments described herein provide an improvement to conventional summarization systems by allowing generation of affective text summaries, which are comprehensible and enjoyable to a large number of users with a variety of affective preferences. In addition, the affective text summaries are generated directly by the affective summarization system, rather than during a post-processing stage (e.g., by modifying certain words in an existing summary). The described embodiments provide an improvement to conventional summarization systems by enabling efficient and accurate mechanism to generate affective text summaries. Further, generating multiple affective text summaries based on an input text document enables affective summarization systems to customize the affective summaries toward any number of user preferences, improving the summarization system's effectiveness and functionality for a wider variety of users.",
                        "The following examples are provided to introduce certain embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, an affective summarization system receives a text document for summarization, such as a news post or scientific journal article. In the affective summarization system, an affect predictor subnetwork analyzes the words in the document, and determines an target affect level, such as a level of formality. The target affect level includes, for example, a numeric value describing how strongly the affect is to be expressed in the output summary, such as level 0 for \u201cvery informal\u201d or level 5 for \u201cvery formal.\u201d Based on the target affect level, an embeddings generator in the affective summarization system generates an embeddings sequence that represents words in the document and also the affective preference indicated by the affective level. The embeddings generator creates a numeric representation of the affect, such as a vocabulary token or an embedding vector, that is included in the embeddings sequence. A summarization subnetwork in the affective summarization system generates and outputs the affective text summary based on the embeddings sequence and the document. For example, an encoder/decoder pair in the summarization subnetwork analyze the words in the document with the embeddings information, and output an affective summary based on the combination of the embeddings and the document words. In some cases, the generated affective summary is provided to an additional computing system, such as a user device or a summary archive system.",

An affect includes psychological or linguistic preferences. Additionally or alternatively, an affect is represented by selections for words in a sequence, such as words selected for a text summary. An affect represents, for example, a level of formality compared to informality, a level of politeness compared to rudeness, a level of objectivity compared to opinionation, or levels of other psycho-linguistic preferences. Additionally or alternatively, affect is represented by the selection of words, such as by selecting (or avoiding selection of) slang, technical jargon, emotional terminology, neutral terminology, or other suitable categories of words that convey an affectation.",

Additionally or alternatively, an embeddings sequence includes at least one numeric value (e.g., a value in a vector cell, a series of values in a vector dimension) representing embeddings information for a word sequence, such as numbers representing relationships between the words in the sequence, or numbers representing an affect level of the words. In some cases, embeddings sequences for multiple word sequences are represented by multiple dimensions of a vector.

For example, an affect predictor neural network, such as the affect predictor neural network 130, is trained based on a first training dataset that is modified to include a discrete affect level. Additionally or alternatively, a summarization neural network, such as the summarization neural network 120, is based on a second training dataset that is modified to include embeddings information representing an affect level.
