    "date": "2011-03-31 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention relates to identification of a compound which inhibits the enzyme NMPRTase and glioma cancer cell growth and further used for glioma therapy. Pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor 1 gene (PBEF1) encodes nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the salvage pathway of NAD metabolism in mammalian cells. PBEF1 transcript and protein levels have been shown to be elevated in glioblastoma and a chemical inhibitor of NMPRTase has been shown to specifically inhibit cancer cells. Here a structure based drug discovery approach has been reported with an aim to develop novel inhibitors for glioblastoma therapy. Present invention relates to virtual screening using docking of ligands from a large library of 13,000 compounds against NMPRTase as the macromolecular target resulting in short listing of 34 possible ligands, of which six were tested experimentally, using the NMPRTase enzyme inhibition assay and further with the glioma cell viability assays. Of these, two compounds were found to be significantly efficacious in inhibiting the conversion of nicotinamide to NAD, and out of which one compound, 3-amino-2-benzyl-7-nitro-4-(2-quinolyl-)-1,2-dihydroisoquinolin-1-one, was found to inhibit the growth of a PBEF1 over expressing glioma derived cell line U87 also.",

                        "Gliomas are primary malignant tumors, originating in the brain, and account for 80% of adult primary brain tumors. Malignant gliomas which includes glioblastoma are the most common and fatal intracranial tumors (Fumari, F. B.; Fenton, T.; Bachoo, R. M.; Mukasa, A.; Stommel, J. M.; Stegh, A.; Hahn, W. C.; Ligon, K. L.; Louis, D. N.; Brennan, C.; Chin, L.; DePinho, R. A.; Cavenee, W. K. Malignant astrocytic glioma: genetics, biology, and paths to treatment. Genes Dev 2007, 21, 2683-710). The prognosis for patients with glioblastoma multiforme, a virulent variety of the disease is rather poor, with a median survival of less than one year (Legler, J. M.; Ries, L. A.; Smith, M. A.; Warren, J. L.; Heineman, E. F.; Kaplan, R. S.; Linet, M. S. Cancer surveillance series [corrected]: brain and other central nervous system cancers: recent trends in incidence and mortality. J Natl Cancer Inst 1999, 91, 1382-90). One of the most important challenges we face today is to develop novel methods of therapy. Several altered genes and pathways have been target of designing novel therapeutic strategies. Inventors had earlier reported PBEF1/NMPRTase/Visfatin as a potential malignant astrocytoma/glioblastoma serum marker with prognostic value (Reddy, P. S.; Umesh, S.; Thota, B.; Tandon, A.; Pandey, P.; Hegde, A. S.; Balasubramaniam, A.; Chandramouli, B. A.; Santosh, V.; Rao, M. R.; Kondaiah, P.; Somasundaram, K. PBEF1/NAmPRTaseNisfatin: a potential malignant astrocytoma/glioblastoma serum marker with prognostic value. Cancer Biol Ther 2008, 7, 663-8). PBEF1 transcript and protein levels were found to be elevated in malignant gliomas, in particular glioblastoma tissue samples and also in the corresponding patients serum samples (Reddy, P. S.; Umesh, S.; Thota, B.; Tandon, A.; Pandey, P.; Hegde, A. S.; Balasubramaniam, A.; Chandramouli, B. A.; Santosh, V.; Rao, M. R.; Kondaiah, P.; Somasundaram, K. PBEF1/NAmPRTaseNisfatin: a potential malignant astrocytoma/glioblastoma serum marker with prognostic value. Cancer Biol Ther 2008, 7,663-8). PBEF1 encodes",
                        "Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the salvage pathway of NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Diphosphate) metabolism in mammalian cells. While the role of PBEF1 over expression in glioma is not understood, it may regulate signaling pathways related to apoptosis and chemosensitivity (Jia, S. H.; Li, Y.; Parodo, J.; Kapus, A.; Fan, L.; Rotstein, O. D.; Marshall, J. C. Pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor inhibits neutrophil apoptosis in experimental inflammation and clinical sepsis.

J.; Goes, J. C.; Brentani, M. M. Gene expression profile associated with response to doxorubicin-based therapy in breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res 2005, 11, 7434-43). A potent inhibitor of NMPRTase enzyme, FK866, has been shown to reduce cellular NAD+, inhibit growth of PBEF1 over expressing cells and induce apoptosis in tumors (Hasmann, M.; Schemainda, I. FK866, a highly specific noncompetitive inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, represents a novel mechanism for induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Cancer Res 2003, 63, 7436-42). The crystal structures of free NMPRTase, NMPRTase bound to NMN, and NMPRTase bound to the inhibitor FK866 have recently been reported (Khan, J. A.; Tao, X.; Tong, L. Molecular basis for the inhibition of human NMPRTase, a novel target for anticancer agents. Nat Struct Mol Biol 2006, 13, 582-8). FK866 is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of human NMPRTase, and the consequent reduction in NAD levels can cause apoptosis of tumor cells while having little (toxic) effects on normal cells (Hasmann and Schemainda, 2003). FK866 also turns out to be the only promising inhibitor known, for the enzyme. The available structures provide a basis for understanding substrate specificity, mechanism of enzyme action and provide a framework for design of novel NMPRTase inhibitors.",

Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; WHO Gr. III) and 5. Glioblastoma (GBM; WHO Gr. IV). GBMs are of two types: primary GBM (de novo type), which manifests in older patients (mean age: 55 yrs), as an aggressive, highly invasive tumor, usually without any evidence of prior clinical disease after a short clinical history of less than 3 months; Secondary GBM (progressive type) is usually seen in younger patients (mean age: 40 yrs) and develops more slowly by malignant progression from diffuse (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO Grade III).",
                        "NAD biosynthesis has been shown to be activated in cancers (Yang et al., 2007). NAD+, in addition to its role as a redox cofactor, is also used as a substrate in several biochemical reactions including mono- and poly-ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) ribosylation (ART (agouti-related protein) and PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase) catalyzed), protein deacetylation and ADP-ribose cyclization. NMPRTase catalyzes the conversion of free nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is a key step in the salvage pathway of NAD+. Expression levels of NMPRTase (also known as visfatin/Pre B-cell enhancing factorl (PBEF1)), was found to be upregulated in colorectal cancers (Jia et al., 2004), suggesting that NMPRTase may be crucial for maintaining cellular NAD levels in tumors. Microarray analyses of glioma cells (grade II to IV) versus normal brain glial cells has identified differential expression of NMPRTase in glioma with 2-5 fold upregulation in glioma cells, depending on the grade of the tumor (increased expression of NMPRTase with greater progression of the disease, Grade IV>Grade III>Grade II). Observation of increased rates of NAD metabolism in glioma, suggests that the cancer cells may be critically dependent upon metabolites produced in the pathway, and presents a possible strategy to counter the disease, through the inhibition of key enzymes in the pathway.",
                        "The crystal structures of free NMPRTase, NMPRTase bound to NMN, and NMPRTase bound to the inhibitor FK866 have recently been reported (Khan, et al., 2006). FK866 is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of human NMPRTase, and the consequent reduction in NAD levels can cause apoptosis of tumor cells while having little (toxic) effects on normal cells (Hasmann and Schemainda, 2003). FK866 also turns out to be the only promising inhibitor known, for the enzyme. The structures provide a basis for understanding substrate specificity, mechanism of enzyme action and provide a framework for design of novel NMPRTase inhibitors.",
                        "The inventive method involves the use of structure based drug discovery approach to find potential NMPRTase inhibitor which is further used as novel inhibitor of glioblastoma. An extremely useful step in the rational design of inhibitors is to utilize the three dimensional structural information of the target protein and identify a possible lead compound from large libraries of compounds. Although several docking algorithms have been developed (Ewing, T. J. A.; Kuntz, I. D. Critical evaluation of search algorithms for automated molecular docking and database screening, Journal of Computational Chemistry 1997, 18, 1175-1189),(Garrett, M. M.; David, S. G.; Robert, S. H.; Ruth, H.; William, E. H.; Richard, K. B.; Arthur, J. O. Automated docking using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm and an empirical binding free energy function. Journal of Computational Chemistry 1998, 19, 1639-1662), virtual screening of potential ligands to a given protein at the three dimensional level has generally been prohibitive on a routine scale, owing to the amount of computing time that is required. However, inventors have recently developed a parallel version of a popular docking algorithm\u2014Autodock (Ruben, A.; Maxim, T.; Dmitry, K. ICM\u2014A new method for protein modeling and design: Applications to docking and structure prediction from the distorted native conformation. Journal of Computational Chemistry 1994, 15, 488-506) and have implemented this on an IBM Bluegene supercomputer (Khodade, P.; Prabhu, R.; Chandra, N.; Raha, S.; Govindarajan, R. Parallel implementation of AutoDock. Journal of Applied Crystallography 2007, 40, 598-599), rendering the docking approach amenable for high throughput virtual screening. Here inventors report virtual screening of a large library of compounds and shortlisting of 6 candidate molecules that are likely to bind to NMPRTase. These compounds were subsequently tested experimentally for their ability to (a) inhibit the conversion of nicotinamide to NAD by NMPRTase and (b) inhibit efficiently the growth of a PBEF1 over expressing glioblastoma derived cell line U87. Based on these studies, a promising lead compound has been identified.",
                        "The inventive method includes virtual screening using docking of ligands from different libraries (n=13214) against NMPRTase as the macromolecular target resulted in identification of six potential lead compounds.

                        "Pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor 1 gene (PBEF1) encodes nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the salvage pathway of NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) metabolism in mammalian cells. PBEF1 transcript and protein levels have been shown to be elevated in glioblastoma and a chemical inhibitor of NMPRTase has been shown to specifically inhibit cancer cells. Here inventors report a structure based drug discovery approach with an aim to develop novel inhibitors for glioblastoma therapy. This invention relates to virtual screening using docking of ligands from a large library of 13,000 compounds against NMPRTase as the macromolecular target resulting in short listing of 34 possible ligands, of which six were tested experimentally, using the NMPRTase enzyme inhibition assay and further with the glioma cell viability assays. Of these, two compounds were found to be significantly efficacious in inhibiting the conversion of nicotinamide to NAD, and out of which one compound, 3-amino-2-benzyl-7-nitro-4-(2-quinolyl-)-1,2-dihydroisoquinolin-1-one, was found to inhibit the growth of a PBEF1 over expressing glioma derived cell line U87 also.

                                "a) Selection of ligand library and preparation of ligands and protein: In accordance with the inventive steps, virtual screening was performed to identify possible lead compounds from the Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 database. The Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 sets are structural representatives of larger non-redundant chemical libraries. This collection includes 14,400 compounds that represent the drug-like diversity of the Maybridge Screening Collection (\u02dc56,000 compounds). All the screening compounds fit Lipinski guidelines for drug-likeness: partition coefficient log P\u22665, H-bond donors\u22665, H-bond acceptors\u226610, molecular weight\u2266500 (Lipinski, C. A.; Lombardo, F.; Dominy, B. W.; Feeney, P. J. Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in drug discovery and development settings. Adv Drug Deliv Rev 2001, 46, 3-26). The Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 set was obtained from www.maybridge.com. The ligand files were prepared for docking using Schrodinger Ligprep software (LIGPREP http://www.schrodinger.com/ProductDescription.php?mID=6&amp;sID=7&cID=0). In addition to generation of energy minimized 3D structures, Schodinger Ligprep was also used for addition of hydrogens and desalting of metal ions. The Ligparse module was used during Ligprep and the ligands with following properties were removed from the set: molecular weight less than 200, number of neutral acceptor groups greater than 10 and number of neutral donor groups greater than 5. A total of 13214 ligands were selected and retained out of the total 14,400 original ligands.",
                                "b) Docking: The co-ordinates of the human NMPRTase (PDB (Protein databank)); 2GVG (it is a unique four letter code in PDB for NMPRTase complex with the reaction product nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)); 2GVJ (it is a unique four letter code in PDB for NMPRTase bound to the FK866 inhibitor) were obtained from PDB (www.rcsb.org). The protein file was prepared for docking by removal of water molecules, addition of polar hydrogens, removal of ligand and phosphate groups in active site, and addition of Kollman charges (Singh, U. C.; Peter, A. K. An approach to computing electrostatic charges for molecules. Journal of Computational Chemistry 1984, 5, 129-145). The macromolecule was treated to be completely rigid for all docking studies to reduce the extensive computational costs. A grid box encompassing both the NMN and FK866 sites (86\u00d760\u00d750; 0.375 \u212b spacing) was constructed and used for all the docking runs. Docking parameter files were prepared for each ligand using the following parameters: ga_pop_size 150; ga_num_evals 2500000; ga_num_generations 500; ga_run 100 and rmstol 1.0. ga refers to Genetic Algorithm that forms the cruz of the software. Ligand confirmations are treated as individuals in a population according to GA, and thus 150 individuals is the default population size that is considered. ga num evals refers to the number of evaluations of the GA run. An energy evaluation is performed every time the GA or the local search computes the fitness of a candidate docking If there is a population of 150, as specified by the \u2018ga_pop_size\u2019 parameter, then every generation, there will be 150 energy evaluations to compute the fitness of all the members of the population. ga_num_generations refers to the GA number of generations. AutoDock stops a docking if either the maximum number of evaluations or the maximum number of generations is reached, whichever comes first. In this case, the docking would terminate based on reaching the maximum number of energy evaluations, namely 25 million evals, since there are fewer than 500 generations in these runs. ga_run refers to the number of runs or number of times a random seed is invoked to perform the ligand fit process. Each time it runs and performs the evaluations and generations on the specified set of individuals, it tries to capture the best fit having the lowest energy, thus in different runs we can expect different or the same binding interaction energy. Thus, more the number of GA runs, better the clustering and docking poses. Rmsdtol refers to the tolerance limit to the structural deviation of the observed poses of the ligand confirmations. Different confirmations of the ligand stand at fairly distant spacing in 3d space, and thus to obtain the clustering of the ligand confirmations as in the best pose, we impose a cut-off value of 1 A from the best pose.",
                                "The Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 dataset was docked using the parallel version of AutoDock 3, available in the laboratory using 256 processors on an IBM cluster. This process greatly reduced the computational cost and time involved in virtual screening of the large dataset (\u02dc13214). Clustering was performed based on the similarity in binding modes and affinities in the run cycles. The Ligand Protein Contacts (LPC) (Sobolev, V.; Sorokine, A.; Prilusky, J.; Abola, E. E.; Edelman, M. Automated analysis of interatomic contacts in proteins. Bioinformatics 1999, 15, 327-32) was used for obtaining the interactions of docked ligand atoms with the macromolecule, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals contacts and the solvent accessible surface area.",
                                "c) Short listing of potential leads: In accordance with the inventive steps, the docking log files (.dlg) were parsed using in-house perl scripts to scan the clustering histograms, and identify ligands that have docked poses with binding energy lower than the cut-off criteria and cluster size greater than the cut-off. The cut-off values were obtained from docking the known inhibitor FK866, and product NMN, to the receptor, and retrieving the docking energy and cluster size values for poses that have least deviation from the crystal pose (RMSD (root mean square deviation) <1.0). Due to the availability of a newer version of AutoDock, the exercise was repeated for the short listed compounds with the same parameters using AutoDock4 (version 4.0.1).",
                                "Energy minimization: Minimization of the docked pose for those which agreed well with the scoring functions was done using CNS software suite (Brunger, A. T.; Adams, P. D.; Clore, G. M.; DeLano, W. L.; Gros, P.; Grosse-Kunstleve, R. W.; Jiang, J. S.; Kuszewski, J.; Nilges, M.; Pannu, N. S.; Read, R. J.; Rice, L. M.; Simonson, T.; Warren, G. L. Crystallography & NMR system: A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 1998, 54, 905-21). Conjugate gradient method was used for minimization with flexibility allowed only for those atoms within the 6 A\u00b0 radius of every atom of the ligand for 150 runs. The topology and parameter files for the compounds were obtained from XPLO-2D software (Kleywegt G J, Z. J., Kjeldgaard, M, Jones TA. Around O. In International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. F. Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules, Rossmann MG, A. E., Ed. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands: 2001; pp 353-356, 366 367). Molecular visualization tool Pymol16(DeLano, W. L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System www.pymol.org) was used to generate the images of the docked complexes.",

Normal brain tissue samples (anterior temporal lobe) obtained during surgery for intractable epilepsy was used as control samples. These samples were originally obtained as a part of an ongoing Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (CSIR-NMITLI) genomics program involving Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences (SSIHMS) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India. The above study has been scrutinized and approved by the ethics committee of the two clinical centers and patient consent was obtained prior to initiation of the study as per the IEC (Institutional Ethics Committee) guidelines and approval. The six best docked compounds were purchased from Maybridge, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK. C14-Nicotinamide (Specific activity 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, USA.",
                                "RNA isolation and RT-qPCR: In accordance with the inventive steps, RNA isolation and RT-qPCR was carried out. Total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissue (normal brain tissue) and cancer cell lines by using the TRI reagent (Sigma). The RNA samples were quantified by measuring the absorbance using a spectrophotometer and visualized on a MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) formaldehyde gel for quality assurance. The relative quantification of the expression levels of selected genes was carried out using a two-step strategy: In the first step, cDNA was generated from RNA derived from different tissue samples using a cDNA archive kit (ABI PRISM); subsequently, real-time quantitative PCR was carried out in an ABI PRISM 7900 (Applied Biosystems) sequence detection system with the cDNA as template using PBEF1 specific primer set and a Dynamo kit containing SYBR green dye (Finnzymes). All measurements were made in triplicates. The genes GARS (glycyl-tRNA synthetase), AGPAT1 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 1), ATP5 G1 [ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 complex, subunit Cl (subunit 9)], and RPL35A (ribosomal protein L35a) were used as internal controls because their expression levels were found to be unaltered in microarray experiments. Delta-delta CT method was used for the calculation of ratios. Sequences of reverse transcription-PCR primers and conditions used will be provided on request."

                                "The crystal structures of NMPRTase, in complex with the known inhibitor FK866/DGB, and reaction product NMN, reveal that the active enzyme exists as a dimer. The catalytic centre is present at the interface of the two chains. There are two active sites per dimer and residues from both the chains are involved in the interactions with the product NMN at each site. The binding pocket of the two ligands resembles a tunnel and involves mostly distinct residues, with NMN binding to one end and FK866 essentially spanning till the other end. However, some residues are common to both, indicating the overlap in their binding poses. An essential feature of both the binding poses is the presence of hydrophobic stacking in which an aromatic group in the ligand is sandwiched between the F193 of one subunit and Y18 of another subunit. The conservation of these interactions, especially the hydrophobic stacking, was used as a criterion for filtering docked ligands, subsequent to the selection on the basis of binding energy and cluster size. Sequence alignment of the human NMPRT, NAPRT (Nicotinic acid adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) and QPRT (quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase) enzymes, performed with ClustalW, shows that they have diverged in terms of sequences considerably. Moreover, NAPRTase does not contain a tunnel at the dimer interface, which is actually the prime factor in the lack of inhibition of NAPRTases by FK866. Structural analyses however shows that they adopt the same fold, yet there is very little similarity in the binding site residues, both in terms of sequence as well as structural features. Hence design of specific inhibitors can be achieved."

Measurement of the ability of NMPRTase to convert 14[C]-nicotinamide to 14[C]-NAD was carried out. Most of the glioblastoma tissues have elevated levels of transcript and protein of PBEF1/NMPRTase. To prepare NMPRTase enzyme, firstly a panel of glioma derived cell lines was tested for NMPRTase transcript and protein levels. Out of seven glioma cell lines tested, two cell lines, U87 and U138, had substantially high levels of PBEF1 transcripts in comparison to normal brain samples (FIG. 2A). Western blotting analysis also corroborated above results that U87 and U138 had relatively higher levels of PBEF1/NMPRTase protein levels (FIG. 2B).",

FK866, the known inhibitor of NMPRTase inhibited efficiently this reaction (FIG. 2C compare lane 2 with 1). As expected, the extract from U251 cells, which had very low levels of PBEF1 transcript and protein, did not convert 14[C] labeled nicotinamide to NAD (FIG. 2C lane 3). Then testing the ability of six selected lead compounds to inhibit NMPRTase activity was done. Out of six compounds, compounds 4 and 5 inhibited NMPRTase activity (FIG. 3A and B). Com 5 was found to be more potent in NMPRTase inhibition (FIG. 3 A and B compare lanes 23-26 with lanes 1 and 2)."
