    "abstract": "Pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor 1 gene (PBEF1) encodes nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase), which catalyses the rate limiting step in the salvage pathway of NAD+ metabolism in mammalian cells. PBEF1 transcript and protein levels have been shown to be elevated in glioblastoma and a chemical inhibitor of NMPRTase has been shown to specifically inhibit cancer cells. Virtual screening using docking was used to screen a library of more than 13,000 chemical compounds. A shortlisted set of compounds were tested for their inhibition activity in vitro by an NMPRTase enzyme assay. Further, the ability of the compounds to inhibit glioma cell proliferation was carried out. Virtual screening resulted in short listing of 34 possible ligands, of which six were tested experimentally, using the NMPRTase enzyme inhibition assay and further with the glioma cell viability assays. Of these, two compounds were found to be significantly efficacious in inhibiting the conversion of nicotinamide to NAD+, and out of which, one compound, 3-amino-2-benzyl-7-nitro-4-(2-quinolyl-)-1,2-dihydroisoquinolin-1-one, was found to inhibit the growth of a PBEF1 over expressing glioma derived cell line U87 as well. Thus, a novel inhibitor has been identified through a structure based drug discovery approach and is further supported by experimental evidence.",

                "Gliomas are primary malignant tumors, originating in the brain, and account for 80% of adult primary brain tumors. The prognosis for patients with glioblastoma multiforme, a virulent variety of the disease is rather poor, with a median survival of less than one year [1]. Several molecular and biochemical abnormalities such as specific chromosomal aberrations, upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), loss of phosphate and tensin homology (PTEN), have been clearly associated with gliomas. Some pathways associated with higher grade gliomas are upregulation of PDGFRA (platelet derived growth factor receptor \u03b1), CDK4 (cyclin dependent kinase 4) and down-regulation of retinoblastoma (RB1) [1]. NAD+ biosynthesis has been shown to be activated in cancers [2]. NAD+, in addition to its role as a redox cofactor, is also used as a substrate in several biochemical reactions including mono- and poly-ADP ribosylation (ART and PARP catalyzed), protein deacetylation and ADP-ribose cyclization [3]. NMPRTase catalyzes the conversion of free nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is a key step in the salvage pathway of NAD+. Expression levels of NMPRTase (also known as visfatin/Pre B-cell enhancing factor1 (PBEF1)), was found to be upregulated in colorectal cancers [4], suggesting that NMPRTase may be crucial for maintaining cellular NAD+ levels in tumors. Microarray analyses of glioma cells (grade II to IV) versus normal brain glial cells has identified differential expression of NMPRTase in glioma with 2-5 fold upregulation in glioma cells, depending on the grade of the tumor (increased expression of NMPRTase with greater progression of the disease, Grade IV > Grade III > Grade II) [5]. Observation of increased rates of NAD+ metabolism in glioma, suggests that the cancer cells may be critically dependent upon metabolites produced in the pathway, and presents a possible strategy to counter the disease, through the inhibition of key enzymes in the pathway.",
                "The crystal structures of free NMPRTase, NMPRTase bound to NMN, and NMPRTase bound to the inhibitor FK866 [6], have been recently reported. FK866 is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of human NMPRTase, and the consequent reduction in NAD+ levels can cause apoptosis of tumor cells while having minimal effect on normal cells [7]. FK866 also turns out to be the only promising inhibitor known, for the enzyme. The structures provide a basis for understanding substrate specificity, mechanism of enzyme action, and hence provide a framework for design of novel NMPRTase inhibitors.",
                "An extremely useful step in the rational design of inhibitors is to utilize the three dimensional structural information of the target protein and identify a possible lead compound from large libraries of compounds. The most efficient method to do this, of course would be to carry out virtual screening. In the recent years several docking algorithms have been developed which are being used for virtual screening of potential ligands to a given protein at the three dimensional level [8,9]. We recently developed a parallel version of a popular docking algorithm - AutoDock [10] and have implemented this on an IBM Bluegene supercomputer [11], rendering the docking approach amenable for high throughput virtual screening. Here we report virtual screening of a large library of compounds and short listing of six candidate molecules that are likely to bind to NMPRTase. These compounds were subsequently tested experimentally for their ability to (a) inhibit the conversion of nicotinamide to NAD+ by NMPRTase and (b) inhibit efficiently the growth of a PBEF1 over expressing glioblastoma derived cell line U87. Based on these studies, a promising lead compound has been identified."

The Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 sets are structural representatives of large non-redundant chemical libraries. This collection includes 14,400 compounds that represent the drug-like diversity of the Maybridge Screening Collection (~56,000 compounds). All the screening compounds fit Lipinski guidelines for drug-likeness; partition coefficient, ClogP \u2264 5, H-bond donors \u2264 5, H-bond acceptors \u2264 10, molecular weight \u2264 500 [12]. The Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 set was obtained from http://www.maybridge.com. The ligand files were prepared for docking using Schrodinger Ligprep software [13]. In addition to the generation of energy minimized 3D structures, Schrodinger Ligprep was also used for addition of hydrogens and desalting of metal ions. The main objective of using LigPrep was to obtain low energy 3D structures of the set of ligands in the library, for use in further computational studies. OPLS_2005 force field was utilized to optimize the geometry and minimize the energy. Force field parameters were assigned to the ligand atoms using default treatment for possible tautomers, and ionization at a selected pH range (7 \u00b1 2 by default), and ring conformations (1 ring conformer by default).The Ligparse module was used during Ligprep and the ligands with following properties were removed from the set: molecular weight less than 200, number of neutral acceptor groups greater than 10 and number of neutral donor groups greater than 5. A total of 13214 ligands were selected and retained out of the total 14,400 original ligands."

The protein file was prepared for docking by removal of water molecules, addition of polar hydrogens, removal of ligand and phosphate groups in active site, and addition of Kollman charges [15]. The macromolecule was treated to be completely rigid for all docking studies to reduce the extensive computational costs. A grid box encompassing both the NMN and FK866 sites (86\u00d760\u00d750; 0.375 \u00c5 spacing) was constructed and used for all the docking runs. Our definition of the site as input for the docking program encompasses the phosphate site completely, since the grid box with dimensions 80 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 50 points with a default spacing of 0.375 \u00c5, is sufficiently large to encompass the entire binding pocket and any nearby minor sites such as that of the phosphate site. Thus, the search space for generating ligand map files using Autogrid, is big enough to encompass the PO4 site, and is not neglected. Docking parameter files were prepared for each ligand using the following parameters: ga_pop_size 150; ga_num_evals 2500000; ga_num_generations 500; ga_run 100 and rmstol 1.0. The Maybridge HitFinder\u2122 dataset was docked using the parallel version of AutoDock 3, available in the laboratory using 256 processors on an IBM cluster. This process greatly reduced the computational cost and time involved in virtual screening of the large dataset (~13214). Clustering was performed based on the similarity in binding modes and affinities in the run cycles. The size of the clusters refer to the total number of conformations of the ligand that bind in the same orientation within the specified RMSD threshold (1 \u00c5 was used in our study) and binding with the same energy. Thus, a cluster is defined as a unit of such similar confirmations. More the number in each cluster better is the accuracy and confidence of the predicted pose of the ligand molecule. The Ligand Protein Contacts (LPC) [16] was used for obtaining the interactions of docked ligand atoms with the macromolecule, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals contacts and the solvent accessible surface area."

The structures of the two complexes were very similar to each other and no significant conformational changes were observed upon ligand binding [6], making it meaningful to compare the binding modes of the two ligands. The catalytic centre is present at the interface of the two chains. There are two active sites per dimer and residues from both the chains are involved in the interactions with the product NMN at each site [6]. The binding pockets of the two ligands overlap partly with each other, together extending into a single large pocket resembling a long tunnel, with NMN binding at one end and FK866 spanning till the other end. Some residues are common to both, indicating the overlap in their binding poses. An essential feature of both the binding poses is the presence of hydrophobic stacking in which an aromatic group in the ligand is sandwiched between F193 of one subunit and Y18 of another subunit. The conservation of these interactions, especially the hydrophobic stacking, was used as a criterion for filtering docked ligands, subsequent to the selection on the basis of binding energy and cluster size. The uniqueness of the binding site has been studied by comparing NMPRTase with closely related NAPRT and QPRT enzymes, present in the same biochemical pathway [6]. A multiple sequence alignment of the human NMPRTase with the other two proteins showed that they have diverged in terms of sequences considerably, but adopt the same fold. Yet, analysis of their binding sites using PocketMatch [21], indicates that considerable difference exists at the binding site level, suggesting that design of specific inhibitors can be achieved. It has also been reported earlier that FK866, a potent inhibitor of NMPRTase does not inhibit NAPRT, consistent with this observation [6]."

FK866, the known NMPRTase inhibitor, inhibited the growth of U87 cells efficiently with an IC50 of 170 \u03bcM (Figure 5 and Table 4). Of the six selected lead compounds, we found that only compounds 1 and 5 inhibited the growth of U87 cells with an IC50 of 335 and 325 \u03bcM respectively (Figure 5 and Table 4). Since compound 1 did not inhibit NMPRTase activity (Figure 4), it might utilize a different mechanism to inhibit the growth of U87 cells. However, compound 5 inhibited NMPRTase activity as well as the growth of U87 cells. Further to confirm that inhibition of U87 cell growth by FK866 and compound 5 is because of their ability to inhibit NMPRTase, we tested the effect of these two compounds on the growth U251 cells which does not express NMPRTase. As expected, neither FK866 nor compound 5 inhibited U251 cells, while adriamycin inhibited very efficiently (data not shown). We thus conclude that compound 5 is a potent inhibitor of NMPRTase and cancer cell growth."

                "Virtual screening procedure carried out resulted in short-listing of six compounds which were obtained and tested experimentally using both the enzyme inhibition assay as well as the cell growth inhibition assay. It is indeed gratifying that two of the six compounds clearly exhibit enzyme inhibition. This clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the docking based virtual screening approach used here, utilizing three dimensional structural information at atomic level detail.",
                "Analysis of the docked poses indicate that two binding modes are observed within the large tunnel like binding pocket encompassing sites for both the natural product NMN and the partly overlapping larger inhibitor FK866. Given that the docking algorithm uses heuristics, a typical docking simulation is carried out by repeating each run about 150 times, each time using a different random number as a seed. This clustering pattern obtained subsequently for each docking simulation reflects the propensity of the ligand to occupy the binding site in the respective modes. Figure S1a-S1f shows the binding sites of all the six compounds. For all the six compounds tested, distinct clusters were observed indicating the two modes of binding as top ranking poses, the first overlapping in position with that of the natural product NMN and the second overlapping substantially with that of FK866. Figure S1i shows the superposition of the site of FK866 (as in 2GVJ) and the site corresponding to the second binding mode of compound 5, which clearly illustrates that the identified compound 5 occupies the same pocket as that of FK866.",
                "The interactions observed in the first mode include a stacking interaction of the aromatic ring in the ligand with the side chains of F193 of one subunit and Y18 of another subunit. In the second mode, interactions with Y188, K189, Y240, S241, V242, S275, I309, R349, I351, and E376 are commonly seen. Figure 1 shows the binding sites of both modes for compound 4, 5; single modes of NMN (as in 2GVG) and FK866 (as in 2GVJ). It is interesting to note that majority of these residues are conserved in the NMPRTase proteins from several sources and their close sequence homologues.",
                "Interestingly, Compound 5 docked with the lowest binding energy of all the compounds in both modes. It forms more number of hydrogen bonds with the binding site residues, all of them being crucial for NMN/FK866 binding. The two modes reflect the most plausible modes of binding for the compounds studied, and any one of them may be more important than the other for achieving inhibition. Irrespective of that, compound 5 is seen to be a better ligand in both the poses, further corroborated by the experimental studies. To consider the situation of the concentration of NMN being high in cellular environment, and hence the possibility of high population of NMPRTase molecules bound to NMN and subsequently any influence this might have for binding compound 5, we repeated the docking exercise with NMPRTase bound to product NMN and next with natural substrate nicotinamide. The second mode of binding for compound 5 was reproduced in this exercise, indicating that this compound will be capable of binding to the enzyme in the presence of NMN/nicotinamide also and will not have to compete with NMN/nicotinamide. This observation leads to favoring the second mode binding as being more important for achieving inhibition. Competition assays using enzyme kinetics has been carried out for FK866, but the interpretation of whether it is a competitive or non-competitive inhibitor is not clear [4,5]. It may also be possible that the compounds could inhibit the enzyme by both modes of action, thus exhibiting a 'mixed inhibition'. Despite these, the fact remains that both FK866 and the new compound identified in this study are effective in inhibiting glioma cell growth and this has been demonstrated to be mediated via inhibition of NMPRTase.",
                "The compound 5 also exhibited highest efficacy in enzyme inhibition and in cell growth assay among all the compounds tested. This compound had, in addition to the hydrophobic and aromatic interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions with F193, G353, G384, R196, H247 and R311 of one subunit and Y18 of another subunit in the first mode; and Y188 and H191 in the second mode. The other compounds, though bind at the same location do not have hydrogen bonding moieties in them, perhaps explaining higher strength of binding and hence inhibition by compound 5."

                "Virtual screening by molecular docking, carried out using AutoDock, has thus proved to be useful in short listing potential lead compounds. Recently Colombano and coworkers [22] reported the synthesis of FK866 analogues and showed that two of them were indeed good inhibitors of NMPRTase. All these are however based on the same scaffold. It is indeed useful to see that two new molecules belonging to different scaffolds have now been identified and tested through experimental methods. Compound 5 in particular, serves as a promising lead compound for furthering structure based discovery of drugs for use in glioma."
