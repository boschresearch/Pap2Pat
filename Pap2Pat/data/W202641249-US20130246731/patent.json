                                "FIG. 1 shows an example graph storage system 100 in accordance with one embodiment. As depicted in FIG. 1, servers 110 (110A, 110B, 110C and 110D) are presented as an example; it is appreciated that a greater or lesser plurality of servers may be utilized in the various embodiments described herein. For the purposes of the instant disclosure, the servers 110, memnodes 110, and clusters 110 are synonymous with one another. Graph storage system 100 also includes global address space 130. Global address space 130 can be provided by any distributed global memory implementation. Graph allocators 120 (120A, 120B, 120C and 120D) are also shown in accordance with one example. It is appreciated that a greater or lesser number of graph allocators 120 may be utilized. In one example, clients 101 (101A, 101B, 101C, 101D and 101E) make allocation requests to graph allocators 120 which invoke a buddy memory allocator 429 on each memnode 110 to manage global address space 130. A buddy memory allocator 429 (see FIG. 4) refers to a memory allocation technique that divides memory into partitions to satisfy memory requests while reducing space wastage. In one example, memory block 140 is allocated by graph allocators 120 and is stored in the memnodes 110. In one example, graph storage system 100 employs a fault toleration structure 160 such that graph storage system 100 is not affected by application clients 101 that issue queries but fail before a query completes. It should be understood that for the purposes of the instant disclosure, application clients 101 and clients 101 are used interchangeably. In some embodiments, graph storage system 100 includes migrator 150 which supports online migration of data across memnodes 110.",
                                "FIG. 2 shows an example graph 200 comprising four vertex objects 210A, 210B, 210C and 210D. It should be understood that graph 200 is merely an example used for purposes of illustration, and that graphs may comprise many more vertex objects 210 than depicted in FIG. 2. For example, graphs with thousands, millions, or more vertex objects 210 may be stored. Example graph 200 further shows edge objects 220A, 220B, 220C, 220D and 220E. Additionally, example graph 200 shows property objects 230A, 230B, 230C, and 230D. In some embodiments, vertex objects 210 and edge objects 220 are stored inside pre-allocated memory blocks 140 while property objects 230 are directly allocated amongst memnodes 110 using the buddy memory allocator 429 within each memnode 110. In other embodiments property objects 230 may be stored inside pre-allocated memory blocks 140.",
                                "In one embodiment, graph storage system 100 employs four properties: (1) support for low latency, interactive graph queries; (2) transactional semantics for fast and consistent updates; (3) distributed storage for fast and consistent updates; and (4) server-side event driven processing. In one example, graph storage system 100 can be tailored to support a variety of graph applications. For example, graph storage system 100 can be tailored to support real-time analysis of influential online players in a large social network. As other examples, graph storage system 100 can be tailored to analyze search trends, social network trends, or traffic patterns.",
                                "Graph storage system 100 is designed to be distributed, allowing it to scale performance with both the data set size and client 101 request rate. By \u201cdistributed,\u201d what is meant is that portions of graph 200 are stored across, and are dynamically updatable across, a plurality of servers 110. Servers 110, sometimes referred to as computing systems, may be distributed. For example, servers 110 may employ a distributed computing system consisting of multiple autonomous computers that communicate through a network. In distributed computing, computer systems interact with each other to achieve a common goal. Servers 110 may be in the same physical location (e.g., in the same building), or geographically separated (e.g., in different countries). Distribution allows graph storage system 100 to support server-side processing of parallel graph processing techniques, which removes unnecessary network round-trip times between clients 101 and servers 110 during computation. Moreover, in one example, distributed storage allows graph storage system 100 to handle dynamic workloads and changes in the cluster size by dynamically migrating internal data structures across servers 110.",
                                "Graph storage system 100 allows graph objects to be distributed across servers 110 to scale storage, balance client 101 load, and support concurrent operations by adding more memory to global address space 130 and/or by adding more servers 110 as desired. Concurrent operations are useful for supporting the implementation of distributed graph techniques, for example the Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming model. In Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming, multiple processors are connected by a communication network and perform a sequence of global steps to execute the program. Graph storage system 100 exports an interface for server side processing of distributed graph functions which can be directly invoked by client 101. For example, distributed graph functions include k-hop and k-core, where k-hop refers to a situation where k is a natural number and hop refers to the number of links between a source and a destination, and k-core refers to a function that determines the k-core of a graph, which is the largest subgraph in which every vertex is connected to at least k other vertices within the subgraph.",
                                "In one embodiment, graph storage system 100 uses distributed memnodes 110 and minitransactions for concurrency-safe access to graph objects stored across servers 110. Minitranactions, in one example, are distributed compare-and-swap type primitives used to access data. Minitransactions ensure that concurrent updates maintain consistency in the presence of failures. Minitransactions optimize on the two-phase commit protocol to reduce network round-trip delays. By using this technique, programmers may rely on fault toleration structure 160, which will be described in further detail below. Due to the efficient in-memory layout and transactional primitives, graph storage system 100 can safely support thousands of update operations per second. The transactional semantics also allow subgraphs to migrate online across servers 110 when the cluster size changes or hotspots occur.",
                                "In one embodiment, graph storage system 100 provides scalable and high throughput storage in support of interactive graph queries. For example, graph storage system 100 can be implemented in a data center where network links are of high bandwidth and network partitions are rare. Implementation in such a data center may help to achieve low latency processing and simplify the handling of faults."

In one embodiment, graph storage system 100 provides support for graph data structures by internally representing graph 200 (e.g., G=(V,E)) as a set of vertex objects 210 and edge objects 220. Both vertex objects 210 and edge objects 220 can have associated property objects 230. Graph objects can be distributed to scale storage, balance client 101 load, and support concurrent operations.

In some embodiments, embedded property 315 is a predetermined size. In other embodiments, the size of embedded property 315 may be dynamic. For example, if graph storage system 100 receives a certain percentage of queries for a particular property object 230, graph storage system 100 may adjust the size of the embedded property 315 such that embedded property 315 may store a particular property object 230.",

First vertex object 210 has to be read to determine the address of property object 230 and then property object 230 is read in the next minitransaction. In some applications certain property objects 230 are accessed often. For example, in a road network each vertex object 210 may be a sensor where speed is a property object 230 which is updated every few seconds, or in real time in some embodiments. To efficiently retrieve frequently accessed objects, certain property objects 230 can be embedded as embedded property 315 in the vertex object 210 or edge object 220. By embedding a frequently accessed property, a network round trip is eliminated because rather than accessing a vertex object 210 to retrieve the address of property object 230, and then making a second network access to retrieve property object 230; a single direct access to a vertex object 210 is involved in retrieving embedded property 315."

                                "In some embodiments graph allocators 120 can pre-allocate large memory blocks 140 of global address space 130 from the buddy memory allocator 429 of server 110 and append vertex objects 210 and edge objects 220 until memory block 140 is full. Generally, a buddy memory allocator 429 refers to a memory allocation technique that divides memory into partitions to satisfy memory requests. In one example, graph storage system 100 employs buddy memory allocators 429 and the graph allocators 120 to pre-allocate blocks of the distributed global memory from the buddy memory allocators 429 to reduce network roundtrips during allocation. Deletion of a vertex object 210 or edge objects 220 within a pre-allocated memory block 140 may result in internal fragmentation. This fragmentation can be reduced through periodic compaction. Pre-allocating memory blocks 140 reduces write conflicts between minitransactions issued by graph allocators 120 and also reduces latency when bulk loading data.",
                                "In one example, when a request is made to create a graph element (e.g., vertex object 210, edge object 220, or property object 230), graph storage system 100 initiates an allocation from the global address space 130 and assigns a unique address to the graph element. As discussed herein, these requests employ graph allocators 120 which in turn invoke a buddy memory allocator 429 on each memnode 110 which is used to manage memory space. Buddy memory allocation, as discussed herein, is a simple technique which reduces memory fragmentation and supports memory compaction. All meta-data in a memory block 140 related to the buddy memory allocator 429 is stored in the memnode 110 itself. Therefore, the failure of a graph allocator 120 does not cause memory leakage. Neither do such failures reduce availability as clients 101 can connect to other graph allocators 120. Graph allocators 120 leverage minitransactions to ensure correctness in the presence of concurrent operations. Minitransactions ensure that the meta-data in memory block 140 for the buddy memory allocator 429 remains consistent.",
                                "In one example, distributed graph storage system 100 allows clients 101 to directly use functions shown in Table 1, rather than multiple client server communication steps. Memnodes 110 may be implemented in conjunction with the remote procedure call (RPC) framework to support dispatch of messages between memnodes. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that an RPC is an inter-process communication that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. In such implementations servers 110 have a configurable number of threads in their threadpools which handle queries to the local memnode 110 and also inter-server 110 communication.",
                                "In some embodiments, during each phase of a distributed graph operation, each memnode 110 goes through a list of views and invokes their compute function. Messages generated during the phase are added to a per-memnode message queue. These messages are asynchronously sent to receivers which may be on remote servers 110. All messages are guaranteed to be received before the next phase begins. In some embodiments, the maximum number of messages that may be addressed to a single receiver are batched and then sent in one RPC invocation.",
                                "As an example of a distributed graph operation calculating the 3-hop neighbors of a vertex object 210, the compute function takes a list of vertex objects 210 as its input and calculates the unvisited immediate neighbors of all the input vertex objects 210. Initially, the client 101 sends the 3-hop request to the server 110 that stores the source vertex object 210. The server 110 executes the compute function to get the immediate neighbors of the source vertex object 210. In the message exchange phase the 1-hop vertex objects 210 are sent to servers 110 that may be storing these 1-hop vertex objects 210. In the next two phases, each server 110, in-parallel, computes the next hop neighbors of the newly encountered vertex objects 210 and then propagates the information to other servers 110. Therefore, all the 3-hop neighbors are found at the end of the second message exchange phase and returned to the client."

In some examples, for memnode 110 failures, graph storage system 100 provides configuration options that support disk images, logging, and primary-backup replication. Disk images and logging ensure crash recovery of memnodes 110 as long as the disks can be accessed. Replication provides higher availability but increases the overheads as data has to be synchronized to the backup before returning results.

In this example, distributed graph functions execute in phases. In each phase parallel computations occur at the vertex objects 210 followed by message exchange with other vertex objects 210. The function terminates when all vertex objects 210 vote to halt. As discussed in examples herein, adding distributed graph functions (e.g., k-hop, k-core, etc.) in graph storage system 100 is simplified since graph storage system 100 employs memnodes 110 and the RPC framework to support the dispatch of messages between memnodes 110.",

Flow diagram 600 includes some procedures that, in various embodiments, are carried out by some of the electronic devices illustrated in FIG. 1, FIG. 4, or a processor under the control of computer-readable and computer-executable instructions. In this fashion, procedures described herein and in conjunction with flow diagram 600 are or may be implemented using a computer, in various embodiments. The computer-readable and computer-executable instructions can reside in any tangible computer readable storage media, such as, for example, in data storage features of servers/memnodes 110 such as RAM 408, ROM 410, and/or storage device 412 (all of FIG. 4). The computer-readable and computer-executable instructions, which reside on tangible computer readable storage media, are used to control or operate in conjunction with, for example, one or some combination of processor 406A, or other similar processor(s) 406B and 406C. Although specific procedures are disclosed in flow diagram 600, such procedures are examples. That is, embodiments are well suited to performing various other procedures or variations of the procedures recited in flow diagram 600. Likewise, in some embodiments, the procedures in flow diagram 600 may be performed in an order different than presented and/or not all of the procedures described in this flow diagram may be performed, and/or one or more additional operations may be added. It is further appreciated that procedures described in flow diagram 600 may be implemented in hardware, or a combination of hardware, with either or both of firmware and software (where the firmware and software are in the form of computer readable instructions).",

In one example, to create graphs, graph storage system 100 provides a Graph class that comprises three basic data types: (1) vertex; (2) edge; and (3) property. Together they represent the application data. Property objects 230 can be attached to any vertex or edge, and store associated data.
