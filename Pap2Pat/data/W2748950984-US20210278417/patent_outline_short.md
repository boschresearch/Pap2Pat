# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

- describe inflammatory bowel disease

## SUMMARY

- introduce DEFA5 biomarker
- outline methods for diagnosis and treatment

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- define terms and conventions
- describe DEFA5 protein and its functions
- introduce anti-DEFA5 antibody and its properties
- describe high affinity and high specificity of anti-DEFA5 antibody
- provide examples of commercially available anti-DEFA5 antibodies
- describe method of diagnosing ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease using anti-DEFA5 antibody
- discuss DEFA5 as a biomarker for distinguishing UC and CD
- describe antibody's complementarity determining region and specificity
- define DEFA5 and its role in IBD diagnosis
- describe benchmark values for DEFA5 levels
- outline assay methods for measuring DEFA5 levels
- detail ELISA assay for diagnosing UC and CD
- describe treatment methods for UC and CD based on DEFA5 levels
- outline kit for measuring DEFA5 in subjects
- illustrate specificity of targeted DEFA5 antibody
- show alignment of DEFA5 with HD1 and HD6
- illustrate diagnostic uncertainty in IBD clinical setting
- show DEFA5 levels in determining patient candidacy for IPAA

### Working Example 1

- distinguish UC and CC molecularly
- delineate underlying mechanisms for differences between UC and CC
- assess DEFA5 expression in IBD patient samples
- conduct retrospective studies on IBD patients
- identify genes differentially expressed in UC vs. CC
- validate DEFA5 expression by various methods

### Prophetic Example 2

- establish specificity and selectivity of DEFA5 antibodies
- optimize DEFA5 sandwich ELISA to detect DEFA5 in sera
- detect DEFA5 expression in FFPE IBD biopsies/tissues by IHC

### Working Example 3

- introduce Paneth cells and their role in IBD
- describe experiments to test hypothesis on DEFA5 and cytokines
- discuss results and implications for understanding CC and UC
