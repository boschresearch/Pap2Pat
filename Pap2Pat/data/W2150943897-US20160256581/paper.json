                "Nanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology to diagnose or treat disease. 1,2 In the \ue103elds of Radiochemistry and Nuclear Medicine, nanomedicines have attracted attention for use in drug delivery and molecular imaging. 3,4 As vectors for drug delivery, nanoparticles offer a range of unique advantages including their ability to modify drug pharmacokinetics in vivo and their capacity to be loaded with high concentrations of different drugs for advancing combination therapies and theranostics. [5][6][7][8][9] Nanoparticle properties can be tailored to control drug release, modify blood circulation half-lives, improve biodistribution pro\ue103les, increase tissue permeability and target speci\ue103city, as well as enhanced metabolic stability. 10 In molecular imaging research, nanoparticles are frequently used to deliver a diagnostic payload such as a \ue104uorophore for optical imaging with Fluorescence-Mediated Tomography (FMT) or a radionuclide for imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). 11,12 Notably, the inherent properties of nanoparticles may also be controlled so that the nanoparticle itself becomes the imaging agent. Prominent examples of using the inherent properties of nanoparticles for imaging include \ue104uorescent emissions from e.g. quantum dots, and the use of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. [13][14][15][16] Nanoparticles have been labeled with a wide range of radionuclides including 18 F (t 1/2 \u00bc 109.7 min), and radiometals like 64 Cu (t 1/2 \u00bc 12.7 h) and 89 Zr (t 1/2 \u00bc 78.41 h) for PET. 15,[17][18][19] However, with current chemical and materials science technology, radiolabeling nanoparticles typically requires signi\ue103cant structural/surface modi\ue103cations e.g. coating of the particle and loading of the nuclide through the use of a chelate or chemically modifying prosthetic group. 12 These chemical transformations can o\ue09den impinge on the pharmacokinetic properties of nanoparticles leading to suboptimal targeting and distribution in vivo. 15 Therefore, development of new radiochemical labeling methods is vital to advance nanomedicine. In particular, a uni\ue103ed strategy for radiolabeling nanoparticles with almost any metallo-radionuclide that avoids challenging, multi-step and nuclide-speci\ue103c chelation and prosthetic group chemistry has the potential to transform the preclinical and clinical use of radiolabeled nanoparticles by simplifying radiolabeling and quality control (QC) protocols. While recent pioneering reports by Chen et al., 20 Wong et al., 21 Chakravarty et al., 22 and Sun et al. 23,24 have disclosed advances in the area of chelate-free radiolabeling of various nanoparticles, to the best of our knowledge, no general method is available for rapid, facile and versatile radiolabeling of nanoparticles using a variety of different metallo-radionuclides.",
                "Here, we report a simple, new reaction that facilitates chelate-free metal ion binding and heat-induced radiolabeling of USPIOs. The chemistry is applicable to a wide range of p-, dand f-block metal nuclides. We demonstrate that Feraheme (FH; a.k.a. ferumoxytol)a United States Food and Drug Administration approved USPIO drug for treating anaemia and in multi-center clinical trials as an MRI contrast agent 16,[25][26][27][28] can be labeled with the metallo-radionuclides 64 Cu 2+ , 111 In 3+ and 89 Zr 4+ , under the same general reaction conditions and without the use of a chelate, to yield thermodynamically and kinetically stable species. Radiolabeled derivatives of FH and other USPIOs have the potential to be used in hybrid PET/MRI, SPECT/MRI and/or radiotherapeutic applications in vivo. Crucially, our technology allows for radiolabeling of metalbased nanoparticles post-fabricationan advance that could allow clinical-grade particles conforming to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to be employed as reagents in the radiosynthesis."

                "The hypothesis underpinning this work was that simple metal ion salts of for example chloride or oxalate anions, could be reacted thermally with USPIO-based nanoparticles under basic conditions to induce metal ion association to the central iron oxide core without using a chelate. Feraheme (average formula: Fe 5874 O 8752 -C 11719 H 18682 O 9933 Na 414 ; MW $ 796 kDa) was selected as an appropriate nanoparticle for testing our hypothesis. Feraheme is a USPIO nanoparticle solution composed of a non-stoichiometric Fe 3 O 4 (or Fe 2 O 3 :FeO) magnetite core approximately 5-10 nm in diameter, and stabilized with a carboxymethyl dextran coating (total size: $17-31 nm diameter; source: http://www.feraheme.com/). The coating increases aqueous solubility and was designed to provide extreme thermal stability of the particles so that terminal sterilization could be achieved by autoclaving at ca. $120 C. [26][27][28] In all reactions, aliquots of FH were used directly from a clinical formulation dose without further puri\ue103cation."

                        "Initial radiochemical studies demonstrated that FH could be labeled with 89 Zr 4+ ions (using either oxalate or chloride salt formulations) 29 under aqueous conditions (pH 8.0) upon heating and stirring the reaction mixture at 120 C for less than 1 h (Fig. 1A). A\ue09der cooling to room temperature the reaction was quenched with excess DTPA, EDTA or DFO (50 mL; 10 mM; $200-600-fold excess ligand versus total moles of Zr 4+ ions). The 89 Zr-FH product was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC; using either 30 kDa spin-column centrifugation or PD-10 column separation; Fig. 1B) in 82-96% decay corrected radiochemical yield (RCY), with an average RCY of 93 AE 3%; (n \u00bc 16 separate reactions), and radiochemical purity (RCP) of >98% a\ue09der formulation in sterile saline (Fig. 1C). On scaling up the reaction to higher initial amounts of 89 Zr-oxalate radioactivity ($3.2 mCi), 89 Zr-FH was isolated in 90 AE 2% RCY (n \u00bc 3). 89 Zr-radiolabeling of the FH nanoparticles was con\ue103rmed further by radio-TLC (Fig. 1D; 89 Zr-FH and 89 Zr-DFO were retained on silica gel plates and remained at the baseline [R f \u00bc 0.0] whereas unreacted 89 Zr 4+ (aq.) ions coordinated as 89 Zr-DTPA eluted with the solvent front [R f \u00bc 1.0]). Note that if the 89 Zr-radiolabeling reaction is quenched with DFO, radio-TLC on silica gel cannot be used to separate unreacted from nanoparticle-bound 89 Zr using an aqueous DTPA (pH 7.5; 50 mM) eluent. The \ue103nal radiochemical yield of puri\ue103ed 89 Zr-FH was typically >95% by radio-TLC and the speci\ue103c-activity was around 0.915 mCi mg \u00c01 of total Fe (equivalent to 0.3 Ci mmol \u00c01 of FH particles). Radio-TLC data are consistent with previously reported data on 89 Zr-DFO-FH in which Thorek et al. 15 radiolabeled FH nanoparticles with 89 Zr via a DFO chelate covalently bound to the carboxymethyl dextran coating. In general, radio-TLC was found to be less reliable (due to possible instability of the particles on silica gel) than SEC for characterizing the RCP and RCY of radiolabeled FH. Note also that due to the small size of the FH nanoparticles ($17-31 nm) magnetic separation was not feasible. For this reason, SEC was used as the primary analytical measure in subsequent stability studies (vide infra). Importantly, control reactions revealed that the observed heat-induced, chelate-free association of the 89 Zr-radioactivity to the FH nanoparticles was speci\ue103c. Control reactions performed by stirring the mixture at room temperature (RT) for 1 h followed by quenching with DTPA showed only 6 AE 2% (n \u00bc 4) of the 89 Zr-radioactivity co-eluted with FH in SEC (Fig. 1B). Radio-TLC of the crude, DTPA-quenched reaction mixtures analyzed before SEC con\ue103rmed the temperature-dependent nature of the radiolabeling reactions. Room temperature reactions gave only $7% 89 Zr-radioactivity associated with the FH. Further, control studies in which FH was omitted from the 89 Zr-mixture found that a\ue09der DTPA-quenching both the RT and 120 C reactions, >98% of the 89 Zr-radioactivity was measured in the small MW fractions (fractions >2 mL elution volume) from SEC. The absence of 89 Zr-radioactivity in the high MW fractions when FH was omitted demonstrates that the activity is bound to the added USPIO and not derived from precipitation, aggregation or agglomeration of 89 Zr alone (i.e. experiments show that even under the basic conditions employed the 89 Zr-radioactivity does not hydrolyze to form 89 Zr-oxide particles).",
                        "In order to examine the possibility that the 89 Zr-radioactivity may be binding to the carboxymethyl dextran coating of the FH nanoparticlespotentially through coordination by the hydroxyl or carboxylate groups -89 Zr-radiolabeling reactions were conducted using an alternate USPIO nanoparticle (Molday ION) that does not have a surface coating. Reactions of 89 Zr-\"chloride\" with Molday ION nanoparticles (stir; 2 h; 250 mCi; pH 8.0-8.5; 0.2 mg Fe total) at RT gave only low levels of 89 Zr-bound nanoparticles ( 89 Zr-NP) at RT (14 AE 3%; n \u00bc 3). In comparison, when the reaction was heated at 120 C higher RCY of 89 Zr-NP (68 AE 9%; n \u00bc 3) was isolated by SEC. These data con\ue103rm that the chelate-free, heat-induced reaction is applicable to both coated and non-coated USPIOs, and suggest that the interaction between 89 Zr ions and FH is centered at the iron oxide core rather than the nanoparticle coating.",
                        "During optimization studies, the pH dependence of 89 Zr-FH radiolabeling was investigated (Fig. 1E). No signi\ue103cant difference in the percentage RCY was observed a\ue09der reacting 89 Zr-oxalate with FH in the pH range 7.1-9.0 (120 C; 2 h; quenched with DFO at RT for 30 min; n \u00bc 3 per data point). Radiochemical yields were consistent with the initial radiolabeling studies ($90% RCY; vide supra). Acidic pH ranges were not tested because the magnetite crystal core of USPIO nanoparticles, including FH, are known to be thermodynamically unstable with respect to decomposition and Fe 3+ ion extraction in the presence of common chelates (e.g. EDTA, citrate etc) in acid. 25,30 Stability studies While the radiolabeling experiments con\ue103rmed that 89 Zr 4+ metal ions speci\ue103cally associate with the magnetite crystal core of FH, association alone is not sufficient basis for developing radiotracers. Therefore, prior to pursuing detailed studies in vivo, the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of 89 Zr-FH was assessed by using ligand challenge and plasma stability studies (Fig. 2).",
                        "Ligand challenge experiments were performed by incubating isolated 89 Zr-FH (200 mCi; $50 mL) in sterile saline, DFO (10 mM; pH 7.0), DTPA (50 mM; pH 7.5); or a DTPA-EDTA mixture (10 mM per each chelate; pH 7.0). Mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 72 h and analyzed by SEC (Fig. 2A). 89 Zr-FH was found to be stable in saline with >99% of the 89 Zr-radioactivity remaining bound to the high MW FH fraction a\ue09der 72 h. When challenged with excess of the poly-carboxylate chelates (200-600-fold versus Zr 4+ metal ion concentration) the radiotracer displayed high radiochemical stability with >95% intact 89 Zr-FH in the DTPA-EDTA mixture and 85% intact 89 Zr-FH in the more concentrated DTPA test a\ue09der 72 h. In contrast, 52% of the 89 Zr-radioactivity remained bound to FH when challenged with DFO.",
                        "Several important features of the ligand challenge experiment should be highlighted. First, unlike EDTA and DTPA, DFO is a siderophore with an exceptionally high affinity for Fe 3+ ions (formation constant for Fe-DFO, log b \u00bc 30.7). As such, DFO represents a more extreme ligand challenge than either EDTA or DTPA to the stability of USPIOs. The chemical instability of The \ue103rst band eluted corresponded to the high MW 89 Zr-FH fraction while the second band (assigned to Fe-DFO) co-eluted with the small MW species ( 89 Zr-DFO) in the 2.0-6.0 mL fractions. In contrast to the DFO challenge SEC, only one orange/ brown band was observed in the ligand challenge experiments with EDTA and DTPA mixtures. Hence, under the conditions employed, EDTA and DTPA are not sufficiently strong chelates to affect Fe 3+ ion extraction and/or magnetite core degradation. Second, the small MW fraction peak for the 89 Zr-DTPA and 89 Zr-EDTA mixtures occurs at fraction volume 3.8-4.0 mL, whereas the equivalent peak for 89 Zr-DFO is both broadened and shi\ue09ded to give a maximum at 2.4-2.6 mL. This peak shi\ue09d to shorter retention time and band broadening is indicative of association between 89 Zr-DFO and the FH (or 89 Zr-FH) nanoparticles. Since the FH nanoparticles carry a predominantly negative charge under the conditions employed, it seems likely that due to the 2+ positive charge on the [ 89 Zr-DFO] 2+ complex at pH 7, a charge-based equilibrium binding occurs on the SEC column between free cationic 89 Zr-DFO (aq.) and 89 Zr-DFO bound to FH. Consequently, these ligand challenge studies also indicate that while it is possible to use DFO to quench the 89 Zr-radiolabeling reaction with FH, DTPA and/or EDTA represent a more appropriate choice of quenching agent since they facilitate 89 Zr-FH puri\ue103cation by SEC and do not induce USPIO degradation.",
                        "Plasma challenge experiments were conducted by incubating both 89 Zr-FH and control Molday ION 89 Zr-NP in human (Fig. 2B) or rat (Fig. 2C) plasma for 72 h at 37 C. Overall, the data demonstrate that radiolabeled nanoparticles are stable with <10% of the 89 Zr-radioactivity released as small-molecules from either 89 Zr-FH or 89 Zr-NP in the presence of human or rat plasma. These data con\ue103rm that chelate-free, heat-induced 89 Zr-radiolabeling leads to species that are thermodynamically and kinetically stable with respect to loss of the activity and decrease in RCP."

                        "A\ue09der demonstrating that radiolabeled 89 Zr-FH was stable, a series of non-radioactive studies were conducted to evaluate the metal ion loading capacity as well as any induced chemical/ magnetic changes in the FH properties that occur on reaction with various metal ions. FH was reacted with solutions of nonradioactive Zr 4+ -chloride in a serial dilution spanning a Zr-to-FH particle mole ratio of 1000 to 0.03 (Fig. 3A; 7-orders of magnitude; mole range n(Zr) \u00bc 5 mmol to 8 pmol). Note that in the radiochemical reaction, given the range of speci\ue103c activity for 89 Zr-salts (470-1195 Ci mmol \u00c01 ), 29 the actual amount of Zr used to radiolabel FH was 10 \u00c09 to 10 \u00c010 moles (equivalent Zr-to-FH ratio of 1.0 to 0.1). These serial dilution experiments (which spanned the radiochemical range) revealed that FH displays a very high capacity for Zr 4+ metal ion association. A linear relationship was observed between the initial concentration of Zr 4+ and the concentration associated with the high MW FH fraction a\ue09der reaction at 120 C for 1 h, quenching with DTPA, and puri\ue103cation by SEC.",
                        "Next, a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV/ vis spectroscopy and T 2 relaxometry was used to investigate the effect of Zr 4+ metal ion loading on the physical (particle size and absorption) and magnetic properties of the Zr-FH nanoparticles. DLS studies revealed that for Zr-to-FH mole ratios #125, no change in particle size was observed (Fig. 3B). Measurements of Zr-FH particle size at loading mole ratios #125 each gave an average particle diameter of $18.1 nm compared to $19.7 nm for FH control samples. Samples measured at higher Zr-to-FH particle mole ratios (>125) exhibited pronounce aggregation with >90% of the particles in solution ranging from 60-400 nm in diameter (average \u00bc 150 nm). These data indicate that as long as the threshold Zr-to-FH mole ratio of approximately 125 is not exceeded (note that radiochemically a mole ratio of 0.1-2.0 is used), the Zr-FH loaded particles remain intact with an equivalent particle size distribution to that observed for clinical FH (diameter of particles in the clinical formulation \u00bc 17-31 nm). Electronic absorption spectroscopy showed that no difference was observed in the absorption pro\ue103les of Zr-loaded FH versus FH control samples in saline (Fig. 3C). Magnetic T 2 relaxometry measurements also con\ue103rmed that the water relaxation properties of Zr-FH were the same as control (reaction blank) FH samples with no difference in T 2 -relaxation time (Zr-FH: 217 AE 18 ms versus FH: 225 AE 9 ms; Fig. 3D). Interestingly, a modest decrease in T 2 -relaxation time was observed for both Zr-FH and control FH samples (isolated by PD-10 elution in saline from reactions conducted at RT and 120 C) when compared to the clinical formulation of FH (experimental t(T 2 ) \u00bc 236 AE 2 ms). This minor difference in T 2 relaxation time is assigned to a change in particle solvation that occurs upon changing the formulation from mannitol (40 mg mL \u00c01 ) in the clinical dose to sterile saline used in these studies.",
                        "Collectively, the DLS, UV/vis and T 2 relaxometry data demonstrate that the FH nanoparticles remain chemically unchanged in terms of their physical size, spectroscopy absorption and magnetic spin-spin relaxation properties a\ue09der loading with Zr 4+ ions to a maximum Zr-to-FH mole ratio of approximately 125-to-1."

                        "Based on the encouraging radiochemistry, stability and physical characterization data (vide supra) we next evaluated the pharmacokinetics and distribution pro\ue103le of 89 Zr-FH in wild-type B6C3F1/J mice using PET/CT imaging (Fig. 4) and ex vivo biodistribution studies. Temporal PET/CT imaging studies (n \u00bc 5 mice) revealed that 89 Zr-FH circulates in the blood during the \ue103rst $6-8 h post-administration (Fig. 4A). Blood pool extraction occurred rapidly with 89 Zr-radioactivity accumulating mainly in liver, spleen and lymph nodes (particularly the mesenteric lymph node; Fig. 4B). Whole-body excretion data showed that 89 Zr-FH was not eliminated with 95 AE 2% (n \u00bc 5) of the 89 Zrradioactivity remaining in the mouse beyond 120 h postadministration (Fig. 4C). Time-activity curves (TACs) derived from volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis of the temporal PET/CT data showed that as the 89 Zr-radioactivity clears from the heart/ blood pool, a concordant increase in liver uptake occurs (Fig. 4D). Uptake was also observed in the spleen and lymphatic systemconsistent with the reported data on 89 Zr-DFO-FH 15 and other labeled nanoparticles. [31][32][33][34][35] Further analysis of the heart TAC revealed that 89 Zr-FH clears from the blood pool with an observed extraction half-life of activity in the heart VOI, t 1/2 (heart) \u00bc 2.21 AE 0.55 h (n \u00bc 3; correlation coefficient R 2 \u00bc 0.958; Fig. 4E). This measured half-life in the heart/blood pool is consistent with the known blood half-life 36 of $40 min for nonlabeled FH in micedifferences are assigned to the fact that PET/CT analysis includes the heart tissue and associated blood pool volume in contrast to direct blood sampling methods used previously. 36 Overall, the PET/CT data showed that the biodistribution and excretion pro\ue103le of 89 Zr-FH is fully consistent with the known biodistribution and dosimetry data of FDAapproved FH. 15,25,31,37 Fig. 3 (A Nanoparticles are known to accumulate in activated macrophage cells. 10,16,32,38,39 Therefore, we evaluated the uptake of 89 Zr-FH in an established subcutaneous (s.c.) chemically induced acute phase response model of in\ue104ammation which has been shown to induce in\ue103ltration and enrichment of activated macrophage. [40][41][42] Full biodistribution data from tissue dissection and ex vivo counting of groups of mice (n \u00bc 5 per group) sacri\ue103ced at 1, 4, 24, 48 and 120 h, post-i.v. administration of 89 Zr-FH are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 5A. Radiotracer uptake in the in\ue104amed (right hind limb) muscle was found to increase over time from 0.48 AE 0.39 %ID per g at 1 h p.i., to a maximum of 0.95 AE 0.12 %ID per g at 120 h p.i. In contrast, non-speci\ue103c 89 Zr-FH accumulation in the control (le\ue09d hind limb) muscle showed a maximum value at 1 h (0.27 AE 0.09 %ID per g) decreasing to a minimum of 0.10 AE 0.02 %ID per g at 120 h p.i. A plot of the in\ue104amed-to-control muscle 89 Zr-FH uptake revealed that 89 Zr-radioactivity continued to accumulate in the in\ue104amed muscle between 1-24 h p.i reaching a ratio of $8.3 (Fig. 5B). Beyond 24 h, the in\ue104amed-to-control muscle ratio continued to increase slightly due to wash-out of activity from the control muscle. A representative coronal PET/CT image of 89 Zr-FH uptake in the in\ue104amed muscle of the right hind limb is presented in Fig. 5C. Note that the absolute uptake of 89 Zr-FH in the in\ue104amed tissue is limited by the comparatively short circulation half-life of these USPIO nanoparticles in mice. Nevertheless, biodistribution data con\ue103rm that 89 Zr-FH uptake in the macrophage-enriched in\ue104amed tissue is speci\ue103c. The mechanism of 89 Zr-FH delivery and accumulation is consistent with the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR). 43 Overall, the PET/CT imaging and biodistribution data in mice are fully consistent with the known distribution of FH (and other USPIO nanoparticles) and with reported data on 89 Zr-DFO-FH. 15,25,31,37 Chemical scope of metal ion binding to USPIOs Having established that our radiochemical studies in vitro and in vivo on 89 Zr-FH provide compelling evidence that chelatefree, heat induced labeling of USPIOs is a practical method for generating novel multi-modality PET/MRI imaging agents, we next investigated the chemical and radiochemical scope of metal ion binding. Temperature dependent FH labeling reactions were performed using non-radioactive chloride ion salts of the p-block ion In 3+ , \ue103rst row d-block transition metal ions Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ , second row d-block transition metal ion Zr 4+ , and f-block lanthanide ions Eu 3+ and Tb 3+ (ESI Table S1 \u2020). Competition reactions were also performed in which mixtures of nine metal ions were reacted with FH (Fig. 6A).",
                        "Remarkably, ICP-MS data revealed that all metal ions tested bound to FH. Yields varied with Zr 4+ ions displaying the highest speci\ue103c binding around 75-80% (note that these data are consistent with the radiochemical data and ICP-MS data on the serial dilution loading capacity measurements [vide supra]). In these non-radioactive reactions, In 3+ ions displayed the lowest affinity for FH with speci\ue103c binding yields in the range 8-16%.  The lanthanide ions Tb 3+ and Eu 3+ showed very similar speci\ue103c binding yields ranging from around 20-40%. Similar binding yields were also observed for Co 2+ , Cu 2+ and Ni 2+ ions (20-40%), and a slight increase in binding yield was observed for Mn 2+ ($35-45%) and for Zn 2+ ions (16% at RT increasing to 67% at 100 C). Notably, an equivalent modest temperature-dependence of the labeling yield was observed for all metal ions tested. Almost no speci\ue103c binding was observed at RT (with the exceptions of Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ ions). However, upon heating the reactions from 40 C to 100 C, speci\ue103c binding yields increased. In general, labeling yields also tended to increase with increasing temperature, and highest metal ion binding yields were attained at 80 C to 100 C for all metal ions tested. Finally, from the metal ion binding competition experiments, Zr 4+ ions were found to out-compete the other metal ions tested.",
                        "In order to validate the results from the non-radiochemical (ICP-MS) labeling reactions, additional radiolabeling reactions (RT and 120 C; 1 h, quenching with DTPA-EDTA mixture for 30 min at RT followed by puri\ue103cation by SEC) were performed using chloride salts of the positron-emitting radionuclide 64 Cu 2+ and the SPECT and Auger electron emitting radionuclide 111 In 3+ (Fig. 6B). The radiolabeling results with 64 Cu 2+ and 111 In 3+ were very similar to those for 89 Zr 4+ reactions: 64 Cu-FH was isolated in 66 AE 6% RCY (n \u00bc 3) and 111 In-FH was isolated in 91 AE 2% RCY (n \u00bc 3) from the reaction at 120 C (both with >99% RCP). Control reactions at RT revealed low non-speci\ue103c binding of 11 AE 6% for 64 Cu 2+ and 9 AE 4% for 111 In 3+ ions. Ligand challenge and plasma stability studies were not performed on 64 Cu-FH and 111 In-FH but it is anticipated that these radiotracers will be stable with results similar to those obtained for 89 Zr-FH (vide supra), and further studies are underway."

                        "Data presented above suggest that metal ion binding may occur at the magnetite crystal core of the nanoparticles (FH and Molday ION USPIOs). In terms of the mechanism of binding, it is conceivable that the metal ions may bind tightly to the crystal surface. However, in an alternative mechanism we hypothesized that binding could involve thermally-induced diffusion of the metal ions inside the magnetite crystal latticeakin to Fig. 6 (A) ICP-MS data showing the percentage of specific metal ion binding to FH after heating the reaction mixture containing nine different metal ions for 1 h at temperatures ranging from RT to 100 C (n \u00bc 3). Note the competition reaction was quenched using a DTPA-EDTA (10 mM per each chelate; pH 7.0) solution for 30 min at RT, and purified using SEC (PD-10; eluent: sterile saline). (B) Table showing the average isolated radiochemical yields of M-FH attained after chelate-free, heat induced radiolabeling for 1 h at 120 C using 89 Zr 4+ , 111 In 3+ and 64 Cu 2+ metal ions. thermally-induced \"doping\" of the nanoparticle coreor inside crystal defects. To test this hypothesis, we performed temperature dependent (5-200 K) high-resolution X-band EMR (also known as Electron Spin Resonance [ESR]) spectroscopy on nonradioactive FH nanoparticles labeled with Zr 4+ , Cu 2+ , and In 3+ ions, as well as control and drug FH samples (Fig. 7 and ESI Fig. S1-S3 \u2020).",
                        "Two main features were observed in all cases for the FH nanoparticles. The \ue103rst feature is a broad line which broadens and moves to lower \ue103elds with a decrease in temperature. Second, a sharper feature at g \u00bc 2 which is only visible at higher temperatures (Fig. 7A). These spectroscopic features are consistent with previous EMR data recorded on iron oxide nanoparticles. [44][45][46] In addition, two signals were observed in the half-\ue103eld region. The signal at g \u00bc 4.0 is mainly visible at higher temperatures and arises due to multi-quantum transitions. 44 The signal at g \u00bc 4.3 was only observed at low temperatures and is paramagnetic in origin resulting from Fe 3+ ions. It should be noted that the low intensity Fe 3+ signal was found to be absent from the FH drug samples but was observed in all metal ion loaded samples (Zr-FH, Cu-FH and In-FH; Fig. S1-S3 \u2020) and the FH blank sample that had been treated in the same way as the loaded samples. Thus, the appearance of this impurity signal at g \u00bc 4.3 is linked to the synthetic method.",
                        "In order to identify if the low intensity paramagnetic Cu 2+ signal could be observed under the intense super-paramagnetic resonance (SPR) signature in the Cu-FH spectrum, samples of solvent blank (1 : 4 v/v ethylene glycol-double distilled H 2 O), free CuCl 2 (prepared at a concentration approximately equivalent to the Cu 2+ ion loading in Cu-FH: $60 Cu 2+ ions per nanoparticle [$25 mM]), FH reaction blank, and Cu-FH were measured using EMR at 5 K (Fig. 7B). The solvent blank gave no measureable EMR signal, con\ue103rming that the signals recorded in other samples arise from the dissolved material (Fig. 7B; green). The sample of CuCl 2 gave the expected axial spectrum with a g t $ 2.08 (Fig. 7B; light blue. Note the signal-to-noise ratio was not sufficient to determine an accurate g k value).",
                        "Next, to deduce if a Cu 2+ signal was present in the Cu-FH spectrum we \ue103rst removed the larger SPR nanoparticle signal. Note that simulating the SPR signal from nanoparticles is nontrivial and many different models have been derived. 47 For this reason, as a \ue103rst approximation the nanoparticle SPR signal was \ue103tted using a polynomial function. Prior to applying our method on the Cu-FH spectrum we validated the procedure in two ways. First, the polynomial \ue103tted SPR signal was subtracted from the experimental spectrum of the FH blank (Fig. 7B; dark blue). Second, the experimental signals for the CuCl 2 and FH blank samples were summed and then the polynomial \ue103tted SPR signal was subtracted to recover the CuCl 2 signal (Fig. 7B; purple). In the \ue103rst validation test, subtracting the \ue103tted SPR data from the experimental FH spectrum gave no EMR signal. In the second test, subtracting the simulated SPR signal allowed full recovery of the CuCl 2 signal, providing con\ue103dence in our method. Finally, the polynomial \ue103tted SPR nanoparticle signal was subtracted from the total experimental Cu-FH spectrum to reveal the presence of a low intensity paramagnetic signal (Fig. 7B; red). Data for the Cu-FH sample showed a signal with a g $ 2.05, which is consistent with the anticipated range of g t values corresponding to Cu 2+ ions. Notably, the signal is shi\ue09ded from that of free CuCl 2 (g t $ 2.08) which indicates a change in the Cu 2+ ion environment. This shi\ue09d is consistent with a mechanism of uncoupled/isolated Cu 2+ ions binding to the FH nanoparticles and provides direct support indicating that a mechanism of direct metal ion binding to the magnetite crystal surface is plausible."

                "As macromolecular scaffolds for developing drugs and imaging agents, nanoparticles offer unparalleled opportunities in terms of exploiting their chemical and structural features such as enhanced rigidity, controlled shape and size, electromagnetic properties, high surface area, variable porosity, resistance to metabolism in vivo, and tuneable chemical reactivity at the surface, on coatings and inside the particle. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] The vast majority of radiochemical methods currently used to label nanoparticles derive from the well-established chemistries of conjugation and radiometal chelation, and from 18 F-labeling reactions. 48 In this regard, reactions that could be considered speci\ue103c to particles or surfaces have rarely been exploited as methods for radiolabeling nanoparticles. Goel et al. have recently reviewed the emerging area of intrinsically labeled nanoparticles. 49 In their pioneering work on chelate-free radiolabeling, Chen et al. 20 noted that arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) ions display high affinity and speci\ue103c chemical reactivity with the surface of magnetite crystals. Radiolabeling of USPIO with radioarsenic nuclides was enabled through reaction of As(III)O 3 trigonal pyramids and As(V)O 4 tetrahedra via site-speci\ue103c occupancy of vacant FeO 4 sites on the octahedrally terminated [111] surface. The same group recently followed this work by presenting a method for developing PET/MRI agents using intrinsically labeled 69 Ge nanoparticles. 22 Inspired by the technology used to produce 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generators whereby the parent 68 Ge (t  89 Ge-labeled super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) could be prepared in the absence of a chelate. In a third example, Wong et al. 21 reported the synthesis of dextran-coated 64 Cu-doped iron oxide nanoparticles. In this work, the 64 Curadionuclide was added to the reaction mixture prior to synthesis of the nanoparticles. Subsequent standard synthesis of the dextran-coated USPIOs led to facile incorporation of the nuclide inside the nanoparticle magnetite core. Finally, in two recent reports, Sun et al. provided elegant demonstrations of chelate-free 64 Cu-radiolabeling of Au nanorods, 23 and 64 Cudoped CdSe/ZnS quantum dots 24 data which provide strong support of our assertion of the generality of heat-induced, chelate-free radiolabeling of USPIOs and other metal-based nanoparticles. In these reports, the researchers noted that these agents show promise for dual-modality PET/MRI imaging and these reactions represent key examples of \"chelate-free radiometal synthesis\". However, with the exception of the data showing 64 Cu-labeling of Au nanorods, these approaches appear to lack generality and/or have drawbacks when labeling pre-fabricated nanoparticles. Labeling with As(III)/As(V) nuclides is speci\ue103c for the exposed surface defects of magnetite crystals and suffers from a lack of chemical control over the oxidation state of the arsenic species. Production of 69 Ge-labeled SPION required an initial 69 Ge-labeling step followed by subsequent coating of the nanoparticle by PEGylation to generate the \ue103nal PET/MRI radiotracer. Although chemical doping during nanoparticle synthesis represents a general way of incorporating different metal radionuclides, this approach requires full batch preparation and QC of the entire nanoparticle for each radiosynthesis. In addition, incorporation of the radiometal prenanoparticle fabrication is not feasible for many short-lives nuclides like 68 Ga (t 1/2 \u00bc 67.7 min). 19 The data presented in this work demonstrates that chelatefree, heat-induced metal ion binding to the magnetite core of USPIO nanoparticles is a facile and robust new reaction. The radiolabeling reaction generates labeled-USPIO nanoparticles which are found to be radiochemically stable with virtually no change in their physical or chemical properties when compared to the native/parent nanoparticle. Notably, minor differences observed in this work are most likely due to differences in the formulation rather than inherent changes to the nanoparticle properties. The fact that the FH nanoparticles retain their physical and chemical characteristics a\ue09der labeling means that our reaction has the potential to expedite clinical translation of radiolabeled nanoparticles for PET/CT and PET/MRI. The reaction was found to exhibit a broad chemical scope with metal ions of different charge (ranging from 2+ to 4+) undergoing reaction with FH to generate M-FH labeled constructs. Importantly, we also demonstrated the radiochemical versatility of our novel reaction. Different metallo-radionuclides including the positron-emitting radionuclides 89 Zr 4+ and 64 Cu 2+ , as well as the g-ray and Auger electron emitting radionuclide 111 In 3+ were successfully bound to FH producing radiotracers that have potential to be used in PET or SPECT imaging, and in radiotherapy. In addition, as noted by others 15,20,21 radiolabeled USPIO nanoparticles (including FH) hold promise for developing dual-modality PET/MRI agents. Indeed, radiolabeled FH shows potential as a PET/MRI imaging agent for characterizing sentinel lymph node metastases and as a potential radiotracer for imaging macrophage activation in e.g. in\ue104ammatory diseases, tumors and myocardial infarct etc. 15,39 At this juncture, full details of the mechanism of metal ion binding to the magnetite crystal are unknown. Experimental data points toward a speci\ue103c and very tight interaction which leads to labeled nanoparticles that display excellent stability under extreme chemical and biochemical challenges in vitro and in vivo. Having excluded the possibility of metal ion binding to the nanoparticle coating (see control Molday ION radiolabeling studies and quenching data vide supra), two potential pathways of interaction involve: (i) metal ion binding to the oxide surface layer of the nanoparticle core, and (ii) thermallyinduced diffusion of the metal ions inside crystal cavities/ defects to generate an equivalent of a \"doped\" nanoparticle. The ligand challenge experiments using DFO suggest that both mechanisms of binding are plausible. However, the EMR data on Cu-FH point toward the most likely mechanism of metal ion binding involving direct interaction with the oxide surface layer of the magnetite crystal core. If Cu 2+ ions penetrate into the FH core such that they became part of the super-paramagnetic system, the Cu 2+ signal would be lost because the EMR spectrum would not show coupling of a single unpaired electron to a Cu nucleus. This conclusion is supported by the experimental EMR data that con\ue103rms coupling of individual electrons to Fe nuclei is not observed in the FH control sample (Fig. 7A). Thus, observance of the Cu 2+ signal in Cu-FH provides direct support for the mechanism of metal ion binding to the crystal surface. However, the absence of a Cu signal does not allow us to exclude the possibility that a thermally-induced \"doping\" mechanism is occurring such that while some copper interacts primarily on the surface of the nanoparticles other ions diffuse into the crystalline core. Further work using chemical, radiochemical, magnetic spectroscopy (EMR, SQUID magnetometry, M\u00f6ssbauer Spectroscopy etc) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (HRTEM-EDX) is underway to elucidate the precise location and mechanism of metal ion binding to USPIO nanoparticles. We are also exploring the use of other metal ions (e.g. actinides like 225 Ac and heavier p-block metals) to expand the potential of using chelate-free radiolabeling to incorporate other radionuclides including a-particle emitters into various metal-based nanoparticles for therapeutic applications. Given the ICP-MS data showed that only mild heating to $40 C was required to induce metal ion binding to FH, we anticipate that our technology may also be applicable to labeling nanoparticles functionalized with biological targeting vectors including peptides, proteins and immunoglobulin fragments etc. Finally, it is conceivable that our discovery of heat-induced binding of metal ions to metal-based nanoparticles will have implications in areas of science beyond Radiochemistry and Nuclear Medicine including drug development and delivery, separation science and environmental toxicology of nanoparticles."

                "Experimental studies have established that the novel chelatefree, heat-induced metal ion binding reaction can be used to label USPIO nanoparticles. The reaction has a wide chemical scope and was found to be applicable to p-, d-and f-block metal ions exhibiting a range of ionic sizes and formal oxidation states from 2+ to 4+. Radiolabeling studies found that 89 Zr-FH was thermodynamically and kinetically stable in vitro in a series of ligand challenge and plasma stability tests. Further, PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies showed that 89 Zr-FH behaves in an almost identical manner to the parent FH nanoparticle i.e. the radiolabeling reactions and metal ion binding appear to have minimal effect on the physical and biological properties of the FH nanoparticles. Additional imaging and biodistribution studies in mice bearing a subcutaneous acute phase response in\ue104ammation model demonstrated the potential of 89 Zr-FH to be used for PET/CT (and possibly MRI) detection of tissues enriched with activated macrophage. Subsequent labeling studies combined with ICP-MS and radiochemistry found that the same reaction conditions used to produce 89 Zr-FH can be employed to yield 64 Cu-FH and 111 In-FH. EMR studies found that a low intensity Cu 2+ was present in the Cu-FH spectrum and these data provide direct evidence in support of metal ion association with the magnetite crystal core of the FH nanoparticles. Collectively, the data provide support for the hypothesis of tight metal ion binding to the magnetite crystal surface through a likely interaction between the positively charged metal ions and the anionic oxide surface layer. We anticipate that our new reaction will have profound implications in Radiochemistry, Nuclear Medicine and beyond."
