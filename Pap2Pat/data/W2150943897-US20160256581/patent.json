                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Macrophage activity is an important indicator of the normal function of the major organs of the reticuloendothelial system (e.g. liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow). In disease, important abnormal sites of macrophage activity include tumors, inflammatory lesions, heart attack lesions, stroke lesions, and major vessel atherosclerotic plaque. Macrophage activity is often viewed by imaging uptake of nanoparticles. However, there is a lack of nanoparticles for imaging macrophage function, especially with radioactivity-based imaging modalities like positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).",
                        "Radiolabeled magnetic NPs can be imaged by PET or SPECT as well as by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most common method of obtaining radiolabeled magnetic NPs is by the covalent attachment of chelates to the NP surface. However, labeled NPs can also be obtained by the adsorption of radiometal ions to the NP surface or by the addition of a radiometal during NP synthesis. Each method, however, has limitations. A chelator on the surface of a metal-bearing NP can be \u201cpoisoned\u201d by small amounts of extractable metal, especially if storage of the chelate-bearing NP prior to radiolabeling is attempted. Moreover, the adsorption of metal ions to the oxide surface may not be irreversible, especially in complex biological media, and is limited to those metals that bind to the NP surface. Radiometal addition during synthesis requires the use of relatively long-lived isotopes, with purification of the radioactive NP and disposal of now radioactive liquid waste. In addition, the starting NPs used for radiolabeling typically have unknown toxicological properties and/or a lack of history of clinical use.",
                        "One iron oxide nanoparticle called ferumoxytol (e.g., FERAHEME\u00ae (FH), available from AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lexington, Mass.), approved for the treatment of iron anemia, can be used to image macrophage function. The iron of ferumoxytol is superparamagnetic and alters magnetic resonance (MR) signals. The structure of FH is shown in FIG. 1a. Ferumoxytol includes a core of 5874 iron atoms present as a super-paramagnetic iron oxide and a relatively thick coating (approximately 10 nm) of carboxy-methyldextran (CMD). The overall diameter of a ferumoxytol nanoparticle is about 25 nm.",
                        "The FH NP formula is Fe5874O8752:C11719H18682O9933Na414. As a radiolabeling substrate, FH NP is advantageous because of its wide availability, well-understood pathways of degradation, and demonstrated clinical safety at high anemia-treating iron doses (relative to the lower iron doses that might be used in PET or SPECT imaging). FH may be used to treat iron anemia by bolus injections of roughly 500 mg of iron. FH is also used off-label to image infiltrative macrophages by MR in many clinical settings.",
                        "Although ferumoxytol is indicated for the treatment of iron anemia, the iron oxide core is superparamagnetic, and it is moderately detectable by MRI. Thus, ferumoxytol has been widely used as an MRI contrast agent for macrophages in various imaging clinical trials. Most clinical trials use ferumoxytol at or around the high dose toxicity limit, and many give poor or marginal results. Trials using ferumoxytol have been conducted in areas including neuroinflammatory states, CNS neoplasms, imaging myocardial infarction, imaging the progression of type I diabetes, imaging the metastatic status of lymph nodes, imaging central nervous system (CNS) function, and the like.",
                        "Use of ferumoxytol as an MRI agent has several limitations. First, high doses and small MR signal intensity changes are characteristic of some tissues, and the dose of ferumoxytol often cannot be increased due to iron toxicity. Some tissues have weak macrophage activity that cannot be visualized when using ferumoxytol and MRI. Moreover, MRI cannot quantify the amount of ferumoxytol in a tissue. On the other hand, PET imaging gives quantitative data on nanoparticle tissue concentrations. Moreover, FH/MRI techniques often require the administration of anemia-treating doses of 400-500 mgs of Fe to non-anemic individuals. It is estimated that heat-induced radiolabelling (HIR) FH for imaging macrophages by SPECT or PET could involve iron doses of only about 5-50 mg/person. In addition the PET imaging of radiolabeled NPs offers higher detectability of tissue NP concentrations and the ability to quantify of 89Zr concentrations in tissues or organs. Thus, the replacement of FH/MRI with 89Zr-FH/PET or 111In/SPECT might offer advantages for imaging macrophage infiltration in various pathologies.",
                        "There are also significant barriers to developing new macrophage imaging agents. First, there are often high regulatory barriers and/or costs associated with the de novo development of clinical imaging agents. Second, current radiolabeling methods are selective for one radioactive metal or another, which limits the applications, markets, and utility of a radiolabeled nanoparticle for macrophage imaging. Third, it is desirable that the radiolabeled nanoparticle be detectable by at least two imaging modalities. This allows multimodal imaging of the same patient to enhance the quality of information obtained.",
                        "Thus, there exists a need for a simple yet general radiolabeling method for iron oxide nanoparticles that minimizes the regulatory costs associated with the clinical translation of a radiolabeled nanoparticle. It is desirable that the macrophage imaging agent meeting these conditions be detectable by at least two modalities (e.g., MR and a radioactive imaging method such as PET, SPECT, or Cerenkov imaging)."

                        "The embodiments described herein generally relate to radiolabeled nanoparticles and methods of synthesizing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to radiolabeling an iron oxide nanoparticle (e.g., ferumoxytol) by heating it in the presence of a radioactive metal ion.",
                        "In the embodiments described herein, heating causes very small amounts of radioactive metal to tightly associate with an iron oxide nanoparticle so that crystal size, coating, and other properties of the iron oxide nanoparticle are not significantly affected. The association between the radioactive metal ion and the iron oxide nanoparticle is tight, as indicated by the radiolabeled nanoparticle's ability to survive the addition of a low molecular weight quenching, metal chelating agent. Because the iron oxide nanoparticle and radiolabeled iron oxide nanoparticle are physically/functionally identical (except for the resulting radioactivity of the radiolabeled nanoparticle), the considerable knowledge of the iron oxide nanoparticle's lack of toxicity and metabolism can be applied to the resulting radiolabeled nanoparticle. This benefit can, e.g., substantially decrease costs of creating diagnostic drugs developed using the embodiments of the present invention.",
                        "The radiolabeling methods of the embodiments described herein have several desirable features. For example, the radiolabeling methods use as a raw material an iron oxide nanoparticle (e.g., ferumoxytol) that is an approved drug for radiolabeling. Although ferumoxytol is used in many of the embodiments described herein, it is contemplated that other suitable iron oxide nanoparticles may also be used. Non-limiting examples of other possible iron oxides include INJECTAFERO (ferric carboxymaltose) (available from Vifor AG, Switzerland) and IMFERON\u00ae (iron dextran) (available from Benger Laboratories, England).",
                        "The methods described herein generally relate to heat induced radiolabeling of an iron oxide nanoparticle. The heating may be similar to the terminal sterilization used in manufacturing ferumoxytol. A variety of metals ions may be used to synthesize the radiolabeled iron oxide nanoparticle, such as, for example, the cations listed in Table 1 below. After heating the iron oxide nanoparticle and the radioactive metal ion, a quenching agent is added. This quenching agent both stops the nanoparticle labeling and removes any loosely-bonded metal ions on the surface of the nanoparticle. The quenching agent is then removed (e.g. by gel filtration, dialysis, spin column filtration methods, other suitable methods, or any combination thereof).",
                        "According to one method, heat is applied to a solution including ferumoxytol and a radioactive nuclide salt. A reaction between the ferumoxytol and the radioactive nuclide salt proceeds rapidly on the application of heat and mechanical agitation (such as stirring, shaking, sonication, any combination thereof, or the like). Heat may be applied until a temperature of from about 80\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C. is reached. In some embodiments, a temperature of from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 125\u00b0 C. is achieved. The pH of the solution may range from 0-14. In one embodiment, the solution is basic (i.e., the pH is greater than 7). The alkaline or slightly alkaline pH values may assist in avoiding iron dissolution. For example, the pH of the solution may range from about 7 to about 11. In some embodiments, the pH of the solution ranges from about 8 to about 9. The solution may include counter ions such as, but not limited to, halogen anions, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, carboxylates, phosphates, metal salts of organic acids including metal oxalate salts, combinations thereof, or the like.",
                        "The radioactive metal ion of the radiolabeling methods described herein may have a radioactivity of about 0.01 mCi to about 50 mCi. In one embodiment, a combination of more than one radioactive metal ion or a combination of radioactive metal ion(s) and non-radioactive metal ion(s) may be used. In another embodiment, the radioactive metal ion has a radioactivity of about 0.05 mCi to about 5 mCi. The amount of the radioactive metal ion depends on factors such as the type of subject (e.g., animal/mouse or human), method of administration, therapeutic versus diagnostic intent, combinations thereof, and the like. For example, less radioactive metal ion is generally required for local administration than for intravenous (IV) administration. Also, the amount of radioactive metal ion required for therapeutic intent is generally higher than for that required for diagnostic intent.",
                        "The amount of iron in the iron oxide nanoparticle of the methods described herein may range from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg Fe. In some embodiments, the amount of iron in the nanoparticle is from about 0.5 mg to about 5 mg Fe. The number of moles of iron (as iron oxide) may exceed the number of moles of radioactive metal ion as conditions are selected. The nanoparticles used in the embodiments described herein are generally heat stable and superparamagnetic.",
                        "Non-limiting examples of metal ions that may be employed are listed in Table 1 below. Note this table is not exhaustive and the embodiments described herein should be understood to extend to all available radioactive metal ions and chemical oxidation states of the metal ions themselves, regardless of their potential use. Alternative radionuclides of the same elements or alternative oxidation states can be employed. For example, 64Cu2+ is listed in the Table 1, but the methods described herein are equally applicable to other Cu radionuclides including, e.g., 60Cu, 61Cu, 62Cu, 66Cu, and 67Cu in either the 1+ or 2+ oxidation state. Other potential radionuclides that may be used include, but are not limited to 11C, 13N, 15O, 18F, 52mMn, 68Ga, 82Rb, 110mIn, 118Sb, 122I, 34mCl, 38K, 45Ti, 51Mn, 52Mn, 52Fe, 55Co, 64CU, 66Ga, 71As, 72As, 74As, 75Br, 76Br, 82nRb, 86Y, 89Zr, 90Nb, 94mTc, 120I, 124I, 67Ga, 99mTc, 111In, 123I, 32P, 47Sc, 89Sr, 90Y, 105Rh, 111Ag, 117mSn, 131I, 149Pm, 153Sm, 166Ho, 177Lu, 186Re, 188Re, 195mPt, 212Bi, 213Bi, 211At, 225Ac, 230U, 82Rb, combinations thereof, and the like.",
                        "According to one embodiment, the particular metal ion used may be selected based at least in part upon the intended application.",
                        "The embodiments of the present invention do not require a change in metal oxidation state or a reducing agent. A polymer-coated, iron oxide nanoparticle/drug may be used, which may assist in reducing toxicological risks and regulatory barriers. The polymer coating assists in stabilizing the iron oxide nanoparticle from aggregation and allows the iron oxide nanoparticle to tightly bond to the radioactive metal ion. More specifically, the polymer-coated iron oxide nanoparticle may be heated to allow the radioactive metal ion to pass through the coating and tightly associate with the iron oxide nanoparticle (rather than cause the polymer coating to dissociate therefrom).",
                        "The heating step of the radiolabeling methods of the embodiments described herein may be conducted at a temperature of about 80\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C. for about 5 minutes to about 500 minutes. In some embodiments, the solution including the iron oxide nanoparticle and the radioactive metal ion is heated from about 60 minutes to about 150 minutes. In some embodiments, the solution is heated to a temperature of about 120\u00b0 C. for about 120 minutes. Heat can be applied using any suitable method or device (e.g., using a microwave device).",
                        "After the reaction of the nanoparticle with the radioactive metal ion is complete or substantially complete, a suitable quenching agent is added to complex with any remaining unreacted or free radioactive metal ion. The quenching agent may have a low molecular weight, e.g., between about 200 and about 2000 (without any metal attached). The quenching also dissociates any loosely-bound radioactive metal ions from the iron oxide nanoparticle so that only radioactive metal tightly bound to the iron oxide nanoparticle remains bound.",
                        "It is contemplated that any suitable quenching agent or combination thereof may be used. The type of quenching agent depends, e.g., on the radioactive metal ion employed. The quenching agent may include common strong chelating agents such as, for example, desferrioxamine, desferrioxamine B (e.g., for Zr), diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and macrocyclic chelates like 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033-triacetic acid (NOTA), any combinations thereof, and the like.",
                        "After quenching, the mixture may be cooled to about room temperature (e.g., about 20\u00b0 C. to about 30\u00b0 C.) and the quenching agent may be reduced/eliminated using any suitable techniques. For example, the mixture may be subjected to purification using, for example, size exclusion methods. Such size exclusion methods may include, but are not limited to, spin column filtration, gel column filtration (e.g., using a SEPHAROSE\u00ae G25 PD10 gel filtration device (GE Healthcare, Sweden)), or size exclusion chromatography. Chromatography may be desirable because it may also be used to demonstrate radioactivity bound to the NP and/or to indicate purity. The association of the bulk of the radioactivity with the high molecular weight fraction (corresponding with the initial nanoparticle) indicates a generally successful nanoparticle labeling reaction. After the nanoparticles have been tightly bonded the radioactive metal ion, the nanoparticles themselves remain generally functionally intact. No (or substantially no) changes to physical properties (other than the fact that the nanoparticles become radioactive) can be observed.",
                        "For therapeutic uses, the iron oxide nanoparticle may be labeled with appropriate radioactive metal ions, such as, for example, those of Table 1. To avoid dose-limiting toxicities to the liver and/or spleen that may be encountered with IV administration and/or therapeutic applications, intratumoral, peritumoral, or subcutaneous injections or local administration of the radiolabeled nanoparticle may be employed.",
                        "The ability to modify existing nanoparticle drugs like FERAHEME\u00ae with a wide range of radioactive metal ions (such as those of Table 1) has broad implications for diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy. As noted above, existing methods and clinical trials typically use ferumoxytol as an MR contrast agent. Radiolabeled ferumoxytol may be used to improve the use of ferumoxytol in diagnostic imaging for any of these applications by, e.g., using it with multimodal MRI/PET instrumentation. Radiolabeled ferumoxytol might be used as a single modality SPECT or PET agent for any of these applications, particularly when MR weak signal intensity changes are small and maximal iron doses have been reached. Radiolabeled ferumoxytol may also be used as a delivery method for administering doses of therapeutic radionuclides.",
                        "One important diagnostic use of radiolabeled nanoparticles of the embodiments described herein includes radiolabeling iron oxide nanoparticles for PET imaging of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which play a key role in the maintenance, aggression, and metastases of tumors. Radiolabeled nanoparticles may be internalized by TAMs. Once a radiolabeled nanoparticle is in TAMs, it can assist in killing the tumor by killing macrophages or through radiation bystander effects on cancer cells, which occurs when radioactivity in one cell kills a second cell that is lacking radioactivity. Currently, there is no agent or imaging technology for imaging TAMs in humans. MRI of magnetic nanoparticle accumulation in TAMs is typically accomplished in animal models but requires prohibitively high doses of ferumoxytol when clinical use is considered.",
                        "Another potential use of the embodiments of the present invention is radiolabeling iron oxide nanoparticles for multimodal (PET/MRI) imaging for lymph node metastatic status. The uptake of magnetic nanoparticles by lymph nodes (after IV injection) is typically used to determine nodal metastatic status by MRI. Radiolabeled nanoparticles may be used for multimodal nodal imaging. Using the embodiments described herein, PET may indicate nodal nanoparticle concentration, and MRI may indicate the precise anatomical disposition of the PET radioactivity. MRI has been used to obtain lymph node size and intranodal features. Adding the quantitation of nodal radioactivity by PET to the high-resolution MRI of lymph nodes may improve sensitivity and specificity of lymph node MRI and/or play a major role in diagnostic imaging.",
                        "Moreover, radiolabeled iron oxide nanoparticles may add substantial value to rapid adaptation of multimodal MR/PET imager technologies.",
                        "Yet another potential use of the embodiments described herein is with image guided tumor therapy with radiolabeled iron oxide nanoparticles. A diagnostic nanoparticle such as, for example, 89Zr:ferumoxytol, may be used for image-guided therapy. In this example, 89Zr:ferumoxytol tumor uptake will be determined by PET, with nanoparticles administered by IV or locally to reduce liver and spleen uptake. A therapeutic radiolabeled ferumoxytol, such as 223Ra2+:ferumoxytol or 225Ac3+:ferumoxytol, may then be used for therapy.",
                        "Yet another potential use of the embodiments described herein is for removing, extracting, or immobilizing target radioactive elements in the +2, +3 or +4 oxidation state from solution through their binding to a non-radioactive iron oxide nanoparticle. An iron oxide nanoparticle may be mixed with a target radioactive metal ion, generally with a molar ratio of iron to target metal of about 50 moles of iron (or, e.g., greater than 50) to about 1 mole of target at a pH greater than about 6, and the mixture may then be heated, with stirring as needed. The stripping (chelating) agent may then be added, and low molecular weight radioactive ions bound to the stripping agent may be separated by gel filtration or ultrafiltration, filtration, centrifugation, or any other suitable separation method(s). The resulting iron oxide nanoparticle with the bound target radioactive metal can be disposed of or digested with acid to release the target metal. Non-limiting examples of ions that may be handled in this fashion are fission decay products including 99Tc, 126Sn, or 90St, or members of the actinide series.",
                        "A particular advantage of the methods described herein is that the extracted elements are incorporated into magnetic nanoparticles that can then be separated from non-magnetic particles by magnetic devices including, for example, high gradient magnetic filters.",
                        "The magnetic nanoparticles need not be non-toxic or biodegradable. Thus, they can be nanoparticles lacking a polymeric coating but ionically stabilized. Magnetic particles used for radioactive metal extraction may be ionically stabilized and composed of metals in addition to iron.",
                        "FIG. 1b illustrates one example of heat induced radiolabeling (HIR) using FH. The HIR procedure outlined in FIG. 1b consists of a loading step where small amounts of a radioactive metal ion are heated with large amounts of FH iron (e.g., about 120\u00b0 C. for about 2 h), followed by a stripping step where deferoxamine (DFO) is added to remove metal ions loosely bound to the NP, followed by a purification step where size exclusion chromatography (SEC) separates the low molecular weight complexes of DFO and ions from the HIR-FH NP. For loading, the metal ion solution was first brought to a pH of about 7-8 with Na2CO3, then added to about 1 mg Fe as FH (about 33 \u03bcl of about 30 mg Fe/mL or about 18.9 \u03bcmoles Fe), and heated at about 120\u00b0 C. for about 2 hours. For stripping, DFO (about 5 \u03bcl of about 20 mM at a pH of about 7-8 or about 0.1 \u03bcmole) was added for 15 minutes at or about room temperature. For purification, the reaction mix was added to a PD-10 column in saline. The FH fraction was concentrated with an about 10 kDa MC AMICON\u00ae centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).",
                        "HIR takes advantage of the high heat stability of the FH NP, as evidenced by the terminal (heat) sterilization step employed in its manufacture. Notably, the temperature of the HIR loading reaction may be less than that used when the drug FH is terminally sterilized during manufacture. HIR is generally considered a \u201cchelateless\u201d radiolabeling method because the chelate is used only after NP loading to strip away loosely bound metal ions and does not participate in the bonding of the radiometal to the NP.",
                        "The HIR procedure of FIG. 1b was used to obtain FH NPs labeled with 89Zr or 64Cu, isotopes used for PET, and with 111In, an isotope used for SPECT imaging. FIGS. 2a-f show the HIR reaction mixes with 89Zr, 64Cu, or 111In analyzed by TLC with a strong cation exchanger and water solvent in which the three DFO:metal complexes stay at the origin while the radiolabeled NP moves at the front. Although DFO is generally approved for iron removal, it has significant affinities for trivalent ions such as, for example, gallium, aluminum, and indium, and copper and binds those ions at the high DFO concentrations employed in the examples of FIGS. 2a-f. In the examples described herein, copper, indium and zirconium ions, or their DFO:metal complexes, generally remain at the origin. Radiochemical yields were greater than about 80% for 89Zr and 111In and greater than 50% for 64Cu.",
                        "A key feature of the HIR loading reaction shown in FIG. 1b is the use of a high molar ratio of NP iron to radiometal. For example, with a typical loading with 89Zr, about 1 mg of FH iron (about 17.9 \u03bcmoles Fe) was heated with about 1 mCi of 89Zr, which corresponds with a Zr mass of about 0.00025 \u03bcmoles (89Zr specific activity of about 4000 mCi/\u03bcmoles) and gives a molar ratio of about 1 Zr to about 71,600 Fe. Thus, heat allows a small amount of 89Zr to bind to a small number of high-affinity binding sites on the FH NP. Since there are 5874 Fe atoms per FH NP, there is less than one Zr per FH NP. The stripping reaction then uses about 0.1 \u03bcmole of DFO (molar ratio of about 400 DFOs to about 1 Zr), to ensure that any Zr that remains bound to the FH NP is tightly bound. The scale used of about 1 mg Fe to obtain 89Zr-FH allowed for injections of about 4-8 mice (about 0.025 kg/mouse) at doses comparable to the FH doses used clinically, which are about 5 mg/kg. A typical FH dose for anemia treatment is about 510 mg (about 7 mg/kg).",
                        "Before using HIR 89Zr-FH in PET imaging, its purity and stability were verified, as shown in FIGS. 2a-f. As an illustrative, non-limiting example, the procedure used to make 89Zr-FH for FIG. 2a is given. After Na2CO3 neutralization, the sample was split, with part heated at about 120\u00b0 C. and part at about 25\u00b0 C. To 89Zr (about 1.547 mCi, about 56 \u03bcl) was added water (about 44 \u03bcl) and Na2CO3 (about 1 M, about 56 \u03bcl) to obtain a pH of about 7-8. To one portion of 89Zr (about 52 \u03bcl, about 501 uCi) in a 5 mL Reactivial was added to water (about 200 \u03bcl) and FH (about 33.3 \u03bcl, about 1 mg Fe), and the reaction mixture was heated in an oil bath with magnetic stirring for about 2 hours. After about 2 hours, the vial was cooled down to or about room temperature in a water bath for about 15 minutes. DFO solution in chelexed water (about 5 \u03bcl, about 20 mM, pH of about 7-8) was added for an additional about 15 minutes at or about room temperature with stirring. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a PD-10 column and eluted by about 0.9% saline. The void volume product (about 454 \u03bcCi) was concentrated by centrifugation. The final about 120\u00b0 C. product (about 415 \u03bcCi, about 130 \u03bcl) was >95% pure by TLC with an RCY of about 82.8%. The specific activity was about 0.023 mCi/\u03bcmol of Fe. The reaction was run using up to about 8 mCi of 89Zr, with Na2CO3 as needed, to achieve pH values of about 7-8 using about 1 mg Fe of FH with stripping and purification steps.",
                        "89Zr-FH was purified by size exclusion chromatography (see FIG. 3a), with the purity of 89Zr-FH fraction confirmed by TLC (see FIG. 3b). TLC indicated the 89Zr-FH obtained by SEC to be greater than 97% pure. Purity was also evident by SEC rechromatography of the 89Zr-FH (see, e.g., the 0 hour time point of FIG. 3e).",
                        "Three types of stability studies were performed. First, the stability of 89Zr-FH was examined in a biological media, mouse serum, by TLC. As shown by FIGS. 3c and 3d, more than 90% of the label was present as 89Zr-FH even after 24 h. Second, the stability of 89Zr-FH was examined in presence of the strong iron and zirconium chelator DFO, a procedure termed the \u201cDFO Challenge.\u201d As shown by FIG. 3e, when 89Zr-FH was incubated in about 10 mM Tris at a pH of about 7.6 containing about 10 \u03bcM DFO for up to about 24 h and analyzed by SEC, more than 90% of the label was present as 89Zr-FH. Since the blood half-life of 89Zr-FH was about 1.02 h, the initial stability time point of about 4 h (FIGS. 3c and 3e) was found to correspond to the clearance of approximately 94% the dose. Third, the stability of non-radiolabeled in FH in mouse serum by relaxometry was examined. This was done to see if FH might dissolve in serum and form high molecular 89Zr complexes with serum proteins. The dissolution of the FH crystal was generally accompanied by a loss of superparamagnetism and a decrease in R1 and R2 relaxivities, while aggregation yielded an increase in the R2 relaxivity. As shown in FIG. 3f, the R1 and R2 relaxivities were generally constant in mouse serum. Thus, the HIR procedure yielded a generally pure, stable 89Zr-FH suitable for PET imaging studies. More data may be found at Boros, E. at al., \u201cChelate-Free Metal Ion Binding and Heat-Induced Radiolabeling of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles,\u201d DOI: 10.1039/C4SC02778G, C. S. 2015, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
                        "In one example, 89Zr4:FH was synthesized by heating followed by the addition of a quenching agent. About 1M of Na2CO3 was added to about 125 \u03bcCi of 89Zr oxalate (about 380 \u03bcL) to bring the pH to about 8.5, which was checked with pH paper. The resulting mixture was then added to a 2 mL conical Reactivial. About 100 \u03bcL of chelex-treated water and FH (about 50 \u03bcL, including about 1.5 mg Fe) was then added. The vial was sealed, and the mixture was heated with magnetic stirring for about 2 hours at about 120\u00b0 C. A quenching agent (e.g., desferoxamine (DFO) mesylate), which strongly bound the 89ZT4+ ions to the FH, was then added. The quenching agent was used to stop the formation of 89Zr4:FH, to dissociate any loosely bound 89Zr4+ from the FH nanoparticle, and to assist in ensuring that any 89Zr4+ that remained was tightly bound to FH.",
                        "After the addition of the DFO quenching agent, the association of the FH nanoparticle and 89Zr4+ was indicated by PD-10 gel filtration gel chromatography. It was also indicated by silica gel chromatography using optical and radiographic methods of detection. In these methods, FH appears yellow/orange on thin layer silica gel chromatography and can be easily visualized",
                        "FIG. 4 illustrates an example of crude separation of radiolabeled 89Zr-FH after reactions conducted at about 120\u00b0 C. and about room temperature (RT). The separation was conducted on a PD-10 size-exclusion column eluted with sterile saline. The first bar in each pair of bars of FIG. 1 indicates the percentage activity at about room temperature, and the second bar in each pair indicates the percentage activity at about 120\u00b0 C. Isolation of radiolabeled high molecular weight (greater than about 30 kDa) material, eluted in the first about 0 mL to about 2.0 mL fractions (the first 3 pairs of bars from the left shown in FIG. 1) was achieved by size-exclusion chromatography on a PD-10 SEPHADEX\u00ae G-25 medium column (GE Healthcare, Sweden). The room temperature reaction served as a control indicating that elevated temperatures (greater than about 20\u00b0 C.) are generally required for 89Zr labeling of FH. FIG. 2 illustrates the results of an analytical PD-10 size-exclusion analysis confirming that the radiochemical purity of the formulated 89Zr-FH (in sterile saline) sample was greater than about 98%.",
                        "The 89Zr4:FH was injected (IV, tail vein) into a C57B6 mouse, and coronal images were taken on a small-animal PET/CT scanner (e.g., a SEDECAL\u2122 PET/CT scanner, available from Sedecal, Spain). The results are shown in the coronal PET images with heat labeled 89Zr:FH of FIG. 6. Namely, FIG. 6 shows temporal maximum intensity projection (MIP) PET/CT images of a female C57B6, 8-week-old mouse, post-IV, with tail administration of 89Zr-FH (192 \u03bcCi in 200 \u03bcL sterile saline). In FIG. 6, H refers to heart, Ao refers to aorta, L refers to liver, Sp refers to spleen, Mes refers to mesenteric lymph node, Med refers to mediastinal lymph nodes, Lum refers to lumbar lymph nodes, Ing refers to inguinal lymph nodes, Ax refers to axial lymph nodes, and Sci refers to sciatic lymph nodes.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 6, at about 3 hours post-injection, 89Zr4:FH was in the blood (blood of heart), which is consistent with FH's blood half-life of about 1 hour in mice, and was partially cleared by the liver and spleen. 89Zr4:FH could be seen in mesenteric lymph nodes and in other lymph nodes such as, for example, the mediastinal, axillary, lumbar, sciatic, and inguinal lymph nodes. IV-injected nanoparticles accumulate to high concentrations in the mesenteric lymph nodes or rodents.",
                        "As demonstrated in, e.g., the examples discussed above, HIR is a unique labeling concept that exploits several features of FH NP chemistry and the behavior of NPs after injection. First, HIR exploits FH's temperature stability, evident from the use of terminal sterilization step in its manufacture. Second, HIR exploits the pH dependent stability of FH to iron chelators. This enables HIR to employ a DFO stripping reaction, the addition of DFO after the loading step, to pull loosely bound 89ZT4 off the NP without NP dissolution. The stability of superparamagnetic iron oxides to chelators at a generally neutral pH is exploited through the use of citrate as a surface active agent for superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs. Finally, HIR exploits the ability of the macrophage phagocytic clearance mechanisms to clear large amounts of injected NPs. Radiolabeled peptides or antibodies bind to small numbers of receptors and require the injection of low masses of injected tracer with needed radioactivity, e.g., high specific activity tracers. Macrophage-targeted MRI agents (e.g. FERIDEX I.V. (AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lexington, Mass.) or COMBIDEX\u00ae (AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lexington, Mass.), or RESOVIST (Schering Aktiengesellschaft, Germany) and Supravist (Schering Aktiengesellschaft, Germany)) inject between about 20 mg and about 300 mg of Fe per human. Because the body's clearance mechanisms for injected NPs can generally handle large amount of NPs, the HIR loading reaction can be performed under conditions where moles of iron vastly exceed the moles of radiometal, a situation generally not possible where high specific activity tracers (e.g. radiolabeled peptides, radiolabeled antibodies) are required.",
                        "The loading reaction of the HIR methods described herein (e.g., about 2 hours at about 120\u00b0 C. using about 1 mg Fe) led to the binding of 64Cu, 111In, and 89Zr to the FH NP (see FIGS. 2a-2f), a binding that was sufficiently tight to survive the DFO stability challenge (see FIG. 3e, which illustrates stability challenge results for 89Zr-FH). Thus, the use of heat to induce binding may be applicable to metals other than 89Zr.",
                        "The HIR procedures described herein may be used to label widely available, approved NP drugs without covalent modification, chelate attachment, or the use of organic solvents. The simplicity of the HIR procedures may reduce the barriers to radiolabeled NP imaging research and/or the barriers associated with the clinical use of radiolabeled NP imaging agents.",
