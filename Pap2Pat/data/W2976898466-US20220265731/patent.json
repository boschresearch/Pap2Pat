    "abstract": "The invention relates to the field of modified Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) and its use for treating gastro-in-testinal disorders. The invention is based on the study of the mechanisms implicated in the probiotic properties of the Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN). This study has allowed the inventors to decouple the probiotic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity by demonstrating that EcN ClbP protein, the enzyme that activates the genotoxin colibactin, is also required for the siderophore-microcins activity of probiotic EcN, but interestingly, not its enzymatic domain that cleaves precolibactin to form active colibactin. Furthermore, inventors demonstrate in an in vivo animal model infected by a bacterial pathogen that administration of an EcN modified strain with clbP gene encoding ClbP protein inactive for the peptidase domain, is non-genotoxic (do not produce colibactin) but keeps the bacterial antagonist activity, and reduces colonization and virulence of the pathogen by maintaining the siderophore-microcin production. Thus this study opens the way to safe use of EcN and accordingly the present invention provides an Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) bacterium carrying a gene encoding ClbP protein which is inactive for the peptidase domain, and its use as a drug and more particularly for use in the treatment of gastro-intestinal disease.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) was isolated during World War I by Alfred Nissle in a soldier who resisted a severe diarrhea outbreak (1,2). EcN was initially studied for its ability to fight bacterial gastrointestinal infections. It was demonstrated to impede intestinal colonization by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) (3,4) and to exhibit an antibacterial activity against enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains (5). EcN is an excellent colonizer of the human gut, and exhibits beneficial effects in various intestinal dysfunctions such as acute diarrhea in infants and toddlers (6), chronic constipation (7), and abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (8). It has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (1) and has proven to be as effective as the gold standard mesalazine for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis in children and adults (9).",
                        "EcN probiotic activity is believed to be based on multiple peculiar properties and fitness determinants, including antibacterial activities against other bacteria (10). Thanks to an extensive list of siderophores (enterobactin, salmochelin, yersiniabactin, and aerobactin) and multiple siderophore receptors and iron transport systems, EcN reduces S. Typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for iron (3). Enterobactin, salmochelin and yersiniabactin are nonribosomal peptides (NRP) or polyketide (PK)-NRP hybrids, which are synthesized by NRP synthetases and PK synthases (NRPS and PKS) activated by a cognate phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). In addition to this competition for a limiting nutrient, EcN exhibits a direct antibacterial activity linked to the production of two microcins (Mcc), H47 (MccH47) and M (MccM) (4,11-13). Mcc are secreted low-molecular weight peptides that are synthesized by ribosomes and posttranslationally modified, and which display a potent bactericidal activity against phylogenetically-related bacteria (14,15). MccH47 and MccM are called \u201csiderophore-Mcc\u201d because they are modified posttranslationally by the linkage of a catechol siderophore (13,16). The C-terminus of the Mcc peptide is covalently bound with a linearized and glycosylated derivative of enterobactin (13,16,17). This siderophore moiety is recognized by the catecholate-siderophore receptors of the target bacterium (12,16). The siderophore-Mcc can therefore enter and kill the sensitive bacterium by a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d stratagem, by mimicking the iron-siderophore complexes.",
                        "Comparative genomic analyses have shown that EcN is closely related to pathogenic E. coli strains such as the uropathogenic strain CFT073 (18-20). EcN and CFT073 share eight genomic islands, including the pks/clb island encoding a NRPS-PKS assembly line that synthesizes the genotoxin colibactin (21, 22). Colibactin is produced as a prodrug moiety that is exported in the periplasm by the efflux pump ClbM (23) and then hydrolyzed by the periplasmic membrane-bound ClbP protein with a peptidase activity, which releases the active colibactin (24,25). Colibactin is not only a bona fide virulence factor (26,27) but also a putative procarcinogenic compound. Colibactin alkylates the host cell DNA, resulting in DNA crosslinks, double-strand breaks, chromosome aberrations and gene mutations both in vitro and in vivo (21,22,28-30). Colibactin-producing E. coli are overrepresented in biopsies of patients with colorectal cancer (31,32) and they were shown to promote colorectal cancer in mouse models (31,33).",
                        "The ambivalence between the pathogenic and probiotic potential of EcN was uncovered when inventors showed that certain enzymes of the pks/clb island enable the synthesis of analgesic lipopeptides (34) and that the probiotic properties of EcN are related to the presence of the pathogenicity island (35). In the Olier et al. (2012) study, inventors inactivated the gene that encodes the phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) ClbA, which was thought to be specific for colibactin synthesis. However, more recent work has shown that ClbA has a pleiotropic effect and also modulates the synthesis of siderophores as well as that of the analgesic lipopeptides (34,36). As might be expected, use of a probiotic strain that produces a genotoxin is a public health concern. Inventors therefore attempted to clearly decouple the genotoxic from the probiotic activities. In this study, inventors used their knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of colibactin and other secondary metabolites produced directly or indirectly by the pks/clb island to specifically abrogate the genotoxic activity of colibactin. Inventors examined the ability of mutants to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria while still producing beneficiary secondary metabolites. Inventors successfully decoupled the probiotic activity from the genotoxic activity, consequently opening the way to optimize EcN. However, inventors were surprised to observe that the pks/clb island was even more intimately connected to EcN probiotic activity than we expected, and that there was a co-evolution of pathogenic and probiotic properties in bacteria. EcN is, to some extent, like the \u201cmiracle drug\u201d aspirin. Although, like aspirin, this bacterial strain has been used successfully for over a century, it is crucial to understand the method of action and to take into account the safety and potential side effects."

In addition to the production of two siderophore-microcins (Mcc) responsible for its direct antibacterial effect, EcN synthesizes the genotoxin colibactin encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and a putative pro-carcinogenic compound. Therefore, this study has allowed the inventors to decouple the probiotic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity. They demonstrated that the pks-encoded ClbP, the enzyme that activates the genotoxin colibactin, is required for the siderophore-microcins activity of probiotic EcN, but interestingly, not its enzymatic domain that cleaves precolibactin to form active colibactin. This study has allowed the inventors to decouple the siderophore-microcins from the genotoxic activities by specifically targeting the peptidase domain of ClbP which opens the way to safe use of EcN. Indeed, ClbP peptidase activity mandatory for colibactin production, has no role in siderophore-microcin production, which provides a way to construct a non-genotoxic strain that retains its antibacterial activity. Furthermore, inventors demonstrate in an in vivo animal model infected by an intestinal bacterial pathogen (S. Typhimurium) that administration of an EcN modified strain with clbP gene encoding ClbP protein inactive for the peptidase domain (ie. ClbP mutated at position S95), is non-genotoxic (do not produce colibactin) but keeps the bacterial antagonist activity, and reduces colonization and virulence of the pathogen (FIG. 8) by maintaining the siderophore-microcin production.",

In particular, the inventors have shown that, mutants EcN bacteria for the gene encoding the ClbP protein which is inactivate only for the peptidase domain according to the invention (ie. mutant S95A, S95R, K98T or ClbP-3H), these mutant maintain in vitro and in vivo its antibacterial activity (through siderophore-MCC production) but not mutant EcN bacteria with an inactivated gene encoding the whole ClbP protein (i.e. see FIG. 4 of Example section). These results evidence that ClbP peptidase activity mandatory for colibactin production, has no role in siderophore-microcin production, which provides a way to construct a non-genotoxic EcN strain that retains its antibacterial activity. Consequently, the mutants EcN bacteria, according to the invention, trigger a more safe and protective response, and thus constitute very promising new probiotic as demonstrated with the in vivo data using modified EcN strain according to the invention (see FIG. 8).",
                                "The term \u201cEscherichia coli strain Nissle 1917\u201d (also called EcN or DSM6601) means a probiotic Escherichia coli strain which was isolated during World War I by Alfred Nissle in a soldier who resisted a severe diarrhea outbreak (1,2).

                                "Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is the active component of Mutaflor\u00ae (Ardeypharm GmbH, Herdecke, Germany), a probiotic drug licensed in several countries for the treatment of multiple intestinal disorders (10). EcN is known to harbour a genomic island, named pks, which carries a cluster of genes that enables the synthesis of hybrid peptide polyketides and especially a genotoxin called colibactin (21). Colibactin is a structurally uncharacterized PK-NRP that is thought to arise from a pro-drug called precolibactin, which has also not been fully structurally elucidated (Li, Z.R. et al. Nat Chem Biol 12, 773-5 (2016); Bode, H. B. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl 54, 10408-11 (2015)). This toxin is produced by a complex biosynthetic machinery involving the sequential action of proteins ClbA to ClbS (Taieb, F., et al EcoSal Plus 7(2016)). The core machinery consists of three polyketide synthases, three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and two hybrids PKS-NRPS. The machinery also employs additional maturation proteins and efflux pump(s).",

Colibactin is not only a bona fide virulence factor (26,27) but also a putative procarcinogenic compound.",
                                "The term \u201cClbP protein\u201d means a peptidase encoded by the pks genomic island of Escherichia coli (and other Enterobacteriaceae). ClbP protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the protein to the inner membrane, a periplasmic peptidase domain containing the active site of protease (the AA residues forming the peptidase being 39-337), and three C-terminal transmembrane helices (the AA residues forming the three transmembrane helices being 390-412, 433-455, and 465-485). ClbP crystal structure and mutagenesis experiments revealed a serine-active site and original structural features, associated with a peptidase activity (24) ClbP allows the maturation of precolibactin in genotoxic colibactin through ClbP peptidase activity that removes the N-acyl-D-asparagine prodrug scaffold from precolibactin (24,25). S95 K98 and Y186 are key residues for ClbP peptidase activity, and mutants for these residues fail to cleave precolibactin to release mature active genotoxin (24,25).",

According to the invention, the inactivation of a specific domain of a gene can be carried out by the various methods known by the skilled person. Examples of methods for inactivating a gene are particularly the directed mutagenesis or the homologous recombination, as described in Conde-Alvarez R. et al., Cell Microbiol 2006 August; 8(8):1322-35. A man skilled in the art, also knows as to design a specific \u201cnuclease\u201d or \u201cendonuclease\u201d (such as CRISPR) in order to introduce a genetic point mutations to inactivate the peptidase domain of ClbP protein or to genetically recombinate specifically the peptidase domain of ClbP protein in order to replace with an non active equivalent",

As previously described (40), HeLa cells are infected for 4 hours with the EcN candidate. The genotoxicity of EcN and the EcN mutant (ie clbP-S95R) is confirmed by an In-Cell Western procedure, as previously described (36). In brief, HeLa cells are infected for 4 hours at a given multiplicity of infection (number of bacteria per cell at the onset of infection). Four hours after the end of infection cells are fixed, permeabilized and stained with rabbit monoclonal anti-gamma-H2AX followed by an infrared fluorescent secondary antibody.",

It was demonstrated to impede intestinal colonization by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (3,4) and to exhibit an antibacterial activity against enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains (5). EcN is an excellent colonizer of the human gut, and exhibits beneficial effects in various intestinal dysfunctions such as acute diarrhea in infants and toddlers (6), chronic constipation (7), and abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (8). It has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (1) and has proven to be as effective as the gold standard mesalazine for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis in children and adults (9). Furthermore, inventors demonstrate in an in vivo animal model infected by a bacterial intestinal pathogen (S. Typhimurium) that administration of an EcN modified strain with clbP gene encoding ClbP protein inactive for the peptidase domain (ie. ClbP mutated at position S95), is non-genotoxic (do not produce colibactin) but keeps the bacterial antagonist activity, and reduces colonization and virulence of the pathogen (see FIG. 8) by maintaining the siderophore-microcin production.",

Most of the time bacterial infections of the intestines result in diarrhea or dysentery, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain or cramping. If the bacterial infection is in the small intestine symptoms include watery diarrhea and/or vomiting. Bacterial infections in the large intestine usually result in dysentery (small fecal volume, with mucus and many times blood). Some diseases follow certain predisposing conditions (antibiotic therapy: pseudomembranous colitis). Not all of these diseases follow infection but can occur following ingestion of preformed toxin (staphylococcal food poisoning). Usually symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) of intoxication occur soon (few hours) after ingestion of the toxin. There are several ways of categorizing this set of diseases. Some categorize them based on location in the intestines (small vs. large intestine), others by how the disease was acquired (food vs. water vs. person to person), and still others categorize these diseases based on what the infectious agent does to the host (intoxication vs. gastroenteritis vs. noninflammatory diarrhea vs. inflammatory diarrhea vs. enteric fever). All of these means of categorizing these etiologies are used to help the physician narrow down the possible causes of the symptoms. GI tract infections are very common. Diarrhea is the most common cause of death in developing countries (2.5 million deaths/year). Pathogens causing diarrhea can be transmitted to humans in three basic ways: in food, in water, and person to person. Many of these infections are self-limiting and do not require treatment. Some can spread to other sites in the body and require treatment to prevent further damage. The trick is in knowing when to treat and how to treat patients.",

We compared it to the pleiotropic ClbA mutant coding for a PPTase (27,35,36). We performed co-culture experiments with the wild-type EcN, the EcN \u0394clbA and \u0394clbP mutants, and the Crohn's disease-associated E. coli strain LF82 which have been previously shown to be susceptible to EcN (45,46). CFU showed that the EcN strain strongly inhibited LF82 growth. EcN antibacterial activity on LF82 was not altered in a \u0394clbA mutant but was completely lost in a \u0394clbP mutant (FIG. 1). A kinetic experiment indicated that EcN inhibitory activity on LF82 started 6 hours post-inoculation and reached its maximum 8 hours post-inoculation, at the beginning of the stationary phase (data not shown). LF82 growth was not altered at any time by the \u0394clbP mutant, further proving the ClbP-dependence of the EcN antibacterial effect. This EcN ClbP-dependent inhibitory activity was also observed with other pathogenic strains of E. coli (JJ186 and NRG857c) and closely related bacteria species, such as Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Typhimurium, and Enterobacter aerogenes (data not shown).",
                        "To further determine whether other components of the colibactin synthesis pathway besides ClbP are required for EcN antibacterial activity, the inhibitory effect of mutants for the PKS ClbC and C1bO, the NRPS ClbH and ClbN, the hybrid PKS-NRPS ClbB, the putative amidase ClbL, the efflux pump ClbM, and the thioesterase ClbQ were assessed against LF82. EcN antibacterial activity against LF82 was not altered in any of these mutants (FIG. 1). These results confirm that colibactin itself or the cleavage product N-myristoyl-D-asparagine is not essential for EcN antibacterial activity against LF82 (and other Gram-negative bacteria, data not shown). Therefore, the probiotic activities of EcN are clearly associated with the presence of the pks/clb island and ClbP but not colibactin is involved in EcN inhibitory activity.",

Therefore, we performed co-culture experiments with LF82, EcN and mutants in MccH47 and MccM production systems. EcN antibacterial activity against LF82 was not affected by the deletion of the MccM precursor gene mcmA alone or the MccH47 precursor gene mchB alone (FIG. 2). In contrast, deletions of both mcmA and mchB almost completely abrogated the inhibitory effect of EcN on LF82. Similarly, deletion of the MccM and MccH47 efflux pump encoding genes mchE and mchF resulted in a loss of antibacterial activity (FIG. 2). The trans-complementation of mchE and mchF increased EcN inhibitory activity compared to the wild-type EcN strain (FIG. 2), probably because of an increase in Mcc export following overexpression of the MchE-MchF efflux pump. None of these mutations in the Mcc production system affected the ability of EcN to produce active colibactin (data not shown).",
                        "To further confirm the role of MccH47 and MccM in EcN antibacterial activity, plasmids that encode MccH47 or MccM immunity genes were transformed in LF82, and the resulting resistance of the strains was assessed against EcN (data not shown). EcN AmchB mutant antibacterial activity was almost completely abrogated on LF82 that carries the MccM immunity gene mcmI (data not shown). A similar result was obtained with the AmcmA mutant and LF82 that carries MccH47 immunity gene mchl (data not shown). Overall, these results confirmed that the EcN ClbP-dependent inhibitory activity against LF82 is due to MccH47 and MccM.",

                        "MccH47 and MccM can be modified posttranslationally by the linkage of a catechol siderophore to form a \u201csiderophore-Mcc\u201d (13). Therefore, we hypothesized that the ClbP-dependent antibacterial activity might be dependent on these modified forms of microcins. In fact, EcN antibacterial activity against LF82 was strongly reduced in a AentE mutant deprived of the enzyme 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase essential for siderophore enterobactin production (47). Similar results were obtained with the EcN \u0394clbA AentD double mutant which was unable to produce enterobactin (36) (FIG. 3).",
                        "The two genes responsible for enterobactin glycosylation and esterification (mcmL and mcmK) are missing from the EcN Mcc gene cluster (18,48). As a result, whether MccH47 and MccM are siderophore-Mcc or unmodified Mcc is still being debated (13). Considering that EcN carries the McmL and McmK homologs, glucosyltransferase IroB and esterase IroD respectively (13), we investigated the interplay between the Mcc and the salmochelin production systems. The antibacterial activity of EcN mutants for genes that encode the glucosyltransferase IroB, the cytoplasmic esterase IroD, the periplasmic esterase IroE, and the export protein IroC (49,50) was compared to the activity of the wild-type EcN strain. Only iroB deletion led to a significant decrease in EcN antibacterial activity (FIG. 3). Complementation of the AiroB mutant fully restored the antibacterial activity. None of these mutations in the iroA locus affected EcN ability to cause megalocytosis linked with the colibactin genotoxic effect (data not shown). These results suggest that IroB could be responsible for enterobactin glycosylation, which enables the linkage of Mcc precursor proteins to the siderophore-derived moiety in the absence of McmL.",
                        "MchC and MchD are respective homologous to MceJ and MceI of K. pneumoniae strain E492 (13). These proteins form a complex responsible for the linkage of glycosylated enterobactin derivatives to MccE492 the precursor peptide MceA (51). The EcN mutant for mchC and mchD lost the antibacterial effect against LF82, whereas complementation restored the initial phenotype (FIG. 2). These results indicate that the posttranslational modification of MccH47 and MccM with an enterobactin-derived moiety is required for EcN antibacterial activity. In short, EcN ClbP-dependent antibacterial activity is due to siderophore-Mcc.",

                        "To further elucidate the role of ClbP in siderophore-Mcc production, we examined whether ClbP catalytic activity is required for EcN antibacterial activity. S95 and K98 are key residues for ClbP peptidase activity, and mutants for these residues fail to cleave precolibactin to release mature active genotoxin (24,25). Co-culture experiments were performed with LF82 and the EcN \u0394clbP mutant complemented with plasmids that encode the wild-type ClbP protein, or the ClbP protein that harbors the substitutions S95A or K98T. EcN \u0394clbP mutants complemented with ClbP S95A or K98T demonstrated antibacterial activities similar to those of the wild-type ClbP protein (FIG. 4), whereas they lost their ability to cause megalocytosis linked with the colibactin genotoxic effect (data not shown).",
                        "To exclude the role of another putative catalytic site of ClbP enzymatic domain, this enzymatic domain was replaced by alkaline phosphatase enzymatic domain of PhoA, as previously reported (38). The PhoA domain was fused with the ClbP N-terminal signal sequence which allows the translocation to periplasm, and the ClbP C-terminal sequence from amino-acid 390; the residues forming the three transmembrane helices being 390-412, 433-455, and 465-485 (24). An EcN \u0394clbP mutant transformed with a plasmid bearing this fusion demonstrated a similar inhibitory activity against LF82 as the EcN WT strain (FIG. 4), whereas it did not cause megalocytosis (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal domain of ClbP that comprises the three transmembrane helices is essential for EcN antibacterial activity, as opposed to the ClbP periplasmic peptidase domain which is crucial only for genotoxic activity.",
                        "To confirm this observation, and as a proof of the concept that a non-genotoxic EcN probiotic strain could be engineered, we used genome editing to construct an EcN mutant strain that exhibits a single nucleotide mutation in the chromosomic clbP gene, which leads to an S95R mutation in the ClbP catalytic site at the amino-acid level. This mutant did not produce colibactin and is not genotoxic but still exhibited an antibacterial activity towards LF82 that is similar to that of the wild-type genotoxic EcN strain (FIG. 5).",

                        "The EcN probiotic is well known to offer protection against enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, by competing for iron and producing the siderophore-microcins (3,4). Thus, we examined whether the EcN wild-type, \u0394clbP and clbP-S95R mutants reduces S. Typhimurium intestinal colonization and pathogenesis using an in vivo model. We utilized C57BL/6 mice treated with streptomycin (to ensure a high colonization) then 24 h later infected with S. Typhimurium alone, or co-administered with S. Typhimurium and each EcN strain (3,4,66). The mice were monitored for clinical signs (weight loss, diarrhea, signs of abdominal pain) and the bacterial colonization was examined by enumeration of the feces, during 4 days (the point where the experiment must be arrested because of the lethality). When administered alone, S. Typhimurium readily colonized the intestine and this was associated with a high clinical score linked to a strong enteric salmonellosis (FIG. 8). In animals co-administered with the wild-type EcN, there was a marked reduction in the clinical scores and in S. Typhimurium fecal colonization (FIG. 8A-B). By day 2 following infection, EcN significantly outcompeted S. Typhimurium (FIG. 8C). In contrast, animals co-administered with the EcN \u0394clbP mutant exhibited higher clinical scores and reduced antagonism of S. Typhimurium colonization, demonstrating the role of ClbP in EcN beneficial effect during acute Salmonella colitis. The EcN clbP-S95R strain reduced substantially the fecal shedding and outcompeted S. Typhimurium, and diminished the clinical scores, similarly to the wild-type EcN (FIG. 8).",
                        "Altogether, these results show that it is possible to decouple the genotoxic activity of EcN from its probiotic (antibacterial) activity, but also that the biosynthetic pathways of colibactin and siderophore-microcins are more entangled than initially thought.",

                        "Comparative genomic analyses have shown that EcN is closely related to E. coli pyelonephritis strain CFT073 and the asymptomatic bacteriuria strain ABU83972 (18). These three strains, as well as the reference strain ATCC\u00ae25922, carry the pks island, the iroA locus, and a truncated Mcc gene cluster deprived of genes mcmL/mchA and mcmK/mchS1. Therefore, we assessed whether the siderophore-Mcc antibacterial effect of these strains was ClbP-dependent, as observed in EcN. The inhibitory effect of two sets of E. coli strains was tested in co-culture experiments against LF82, as well as their respective \u0394clbP mutants: i) strains similar to EcN that carry both a truncated Mcc gene cluster and the pks island: strains CFT073, ABU83972, and ATCC\u00ae25922; and ii) strains that carry the pks island but which are deprived of Mcc encoding genes: the human commensal strain M1/5, the meningitis-causing strain SP15, the murine commensal strain NC101, and the laboratory strain MG1655 that hosts a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) bearing the pks island. The three wild-type strains that carry both a truncated Mcc gene cluster and the pks island exhibited a marked inhibitory effect as observed in EcN (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of all three corresponding \u0394clbP mutant strains was significantly reduced, whereas ClbP complementation restored the initial phenotype (data not shown). In contrast, in strains carrying only the pks island, there was no significant difference in LF82 growth whether it was cultivated with the wild-type strains or the \u0394clbP mutants (data not shown). Cumulatively, these results show that the peptidase ClbP is involved in MccH47 and MccM antibacterial activity in E. coli strains that carry both the pks island and a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster. Our results also show that this association is present in both pathogenic strains and probiotic strains.",

This antibacterial activity requires ClbP from the biosynthetic pathway that produces the genotoxin colibactin and IroB from the biosynthetic pathway that produces the siderophore salmochelin. Consequently, we checked this association between the pks island, the iro locus and the Mcc island in E. coli strains with genomes available in GenBank. Interestingly, all strains that lacked the mcmL and mcmK genes responsible for posttranslational modifications belonged to the B2 phylogroup and carried the pks island and iroA (data not shown), except for strain 1105 deprived of pks island. Conversely, the strains that carry mcmL/mchA and mcmK/mchSl belonged to B1, C or D phylogroups and lacked the pks island. These particular associations of genetic determinants led to the hypothesis that the truncated island is present almost exclusively in strains that carry pks and the iroA locus. It suggests that this interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and the siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways is due to a co-selection in strains that is either pathogenic or probiotic.",

It was recently shown that the metabolite C12AsnGABAOH is produced by Nissle 1917 wild-type (but not by a clbN mutant, indicating that the pks-encoded machinery has a role in its production) (34). C12-Asn-GABAOH was shown to inhibit nociceptors activation in neurons. Nociceptor neurons in the intestinal tract play an important role in protecting against enteropathogens and intestinal homeostasis, as they regulate M cell density and inflammation. Thus, it is important that we ensure that a non-genotoxic modified strain retain production of C12AsnGABAOH with a role in the anti-inflammatory property of Nissle.",

                        "Since Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, antibiotics have contributed to the increase in human life expectancy. Many infections which were previously fatal became curable. Unfortunately, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, in parallel with the lack of new antibacterial drugs enabled multi-resistant bacteria to emerge and spread (52). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this phenomenon \u201cposes a substantial threat to morbidity and mortality worldwide\u201d (53). The trend is especially worrying for Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, the number of deaths attributable to 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant or carbapenem-resistant E. coli increased by more than 4 times in Europe between 2007 and 2015 (54). Of the antibiotics that are currently being developed for intravenous administration, only a small proportion (15 out of 44) demonstrates some activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and all these molecules are derived from known antibiotic classes. Consequently, the WHO established that research and development of new antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria was a \u201ccritical priority\u201d (53).",
                        "In the search for new antimicrobials, microcins seem a promising alternative to \u201cconventional\u201d antibiotics. In fact, many microcins exhibit potent narrow-spectrum antimicrobial activity, whereas antibiotics can eliminate beneficial bacteria, alter the microbiota and promote the selection of resistant strains (55,56). A major challenge in using microcins is their delivery in sufficient quantities to the site of infection, especially after oral administration because they are often degraded in the upper digestive tract (57,58). Engineered probiotic bacteria were consequently proposed as in situ producers of microcins to fight against enteropathogens (59) or to reduce colonization by multi-resistant bacteria (60).",
                        "EcN has been used as a probiotic for over a century, with numerous therapeutic benefits described. However, serious concerns about the safety of EcN administration have emerged over the years. EcN was reported to be responsible for severe sepsis in an infant (61) and its genome was shown to have the pathogenicity island pks (21,35), which codes for colibactin, a bona fide virulence factor for E. coli strains responsible for extraintestinal infections (26,27). In addition, the carriage of colibactin producing E. coli could also be deleterious to gut homeostasis. In adult rats, it increased intestinal epithelial permeability, led to signs of genotoxic damages in intestinal cells, such as crypt fission, and increased cell proliferation (28). In mice predisposed to colorectal cancer, pks-positive E. coli increased the size and the number of tumors (31,62). In human beings, several studies reported that pks-positive E. coli were over-represented in colorectal cancer biopsies compared to controls (31,32,63). On a whole, these studies suggest that colibactin-producing bacteria could promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, our goal was to understand the interplay between the production of the genotoxin colibactin and the beneficial effects related to the pks island in the probiotic activity of EcN. Consequently, we attempted to disarm EcN while keeping its probiotic properties.",
                        "In a previous attempt, our team constructed a non-genotoxic EcN PPTase ClbA mutant, which also lost its probiotic activity (35). Subsequently, it was discovered that the PPTase ClbA contributes to the synthesis of enterobactin (and therefore salmochelin) and yersiniabactin (36). In this study, we demonstrated that there is collaboration between the salmochelin (iroB) and the Mcc gene clusters, both of which are located on EcN genomic island I, and the pks island (clbP) (FIG. 6). The interweaving is so strong between these determinants, that a single protein, ClbP is involved both in colibactin and Mcc production. Up until now, ClbP had only been described as a peptidase that removes the N-acyl-D-asparagine prodrug scaffold from precolibactin (24,25). Although the complete C-terminal domain with the three transmembrane helices is required for the bioactivity of ClbP, the catalytic activity is performed by the N-terminal periplasmic domain (25,38). In this study, we demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of ClbP, deprived of the known enzymatic function, is necessary for EcN antibacterial activity due to MccH47 and MccM. It suggests that the ClbP C-terminal transmembrane domain could facilitate the export of the MccH47 and MccM of EcN through the MchE-MchF efflux pump (FIG. 7).",
                        "Using both functional and bioinformatic analyses, we demonstrated interplay between siderophore-Mcc, salmochelin, and colibactin assembly lines. Strikingly, two groups of E. coli strains emerged. On one hand, all strains that carry a \u201ctruncated\u201d MccH47 and MccM gene cluster (i.e. strains such as EcN lacking mcmL/mchA and mcmK/mchS1) are B2 strains that also bear the pks island and the iroA locus. It should be noted that isolates from urine were over-represented in this group of strains (CFT073, clones D i14 and D i2, UPEC 26-1, and ABU 83972). On the other hand, the pks island and the iroA locus are absent in the non-B2 strains that carry a \u201ccomplete\u201d MccH47 and MccM gene cluster. All these strains were isolated from stools (except ACNO02 for which the origin is unknown). Therefore, we can hypothesize that these strains with a \u201ccomplete\u201d Mcc gene cluster are specialized in Mcc production in order to survive in the competitive intestinal environment, which is their exclusive niche. In contrast, extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) must be efficient gut colonizers in order to emerge from the intestinal niche and infect other body sites (such as the urinary tract) to which they must subsequently adapt. That is why it has been suggested that ExPEC are \u201cgeneralists\u201d rather than specialized strains (64). The strains we examined in our study fit this model. They can express various virulence factors depending on their environment: MccH47 and M, siderophores and analgesic lipopeptides derived from the colibactin pathway, for instance. To be able to produce so many virulence or fitness factors with a genome of limited size (65), the elements of the assembly lines that produce these determinants must be versatile and intervene in several apparently independent metabolic pathways.",
                        "In conclusion, we discovered that the pks island is even more intimately connected to EcN probiotic activity than expected. This entanglement reflects the co-evolution of probiotic and pathogenic determinants to adapt to various environments. Decoupling the probiotic from the genotoxic activities by specifically targeting the enzymatic domain of ClbP opens the way to safe use of EcN."
