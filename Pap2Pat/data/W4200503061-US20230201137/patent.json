    "title": "NEUTROPHIL SUPPRESSION AS PRECONDITIONING TO INCREASE ONCOLYTIC BACTERIAL THERAPY",
    "date": "2022-12-20 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Provided herein are methods for increasing the therapeutic efficiency of oncolytic bacterial therapeutics. Bacterial oncolytic therapies, especially the ones targeting tumor hypoxia such as C. novyi-NT, often encounter incomplete tumor clearance in less hypoxic tumoral areas and severe inflammatory reactions. In this study, we explored immune-modulating preconditioning to suppress the host neutrophils and significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of C. novyi-NT in animal models, including an orthotopic brain tumor model in rabbits. The optimized preconditioning agent, hydroxyurea, is clinically approved and C. novyi-NT has demonstrated manageable safety and promising antitumor responses in clinical trials. Thus, the proposed preconditioning of neutrophil suppression is readily translatable to patients undergoing C. novyi-NT trials or other oncolytic biologic therapies and could improve outcome.",

                                "Hypoxia in solid tumors is a major hindrance in cancer therapy, as most tumors, including the most aggressive brain tumor, glioblastoma, contain large, poorly vascularized hypoxic areas that limit the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the presence of hypoxia in solid tumors offers the potential for therapeutic anaerobic bacterial colonization in which anaerobic bacteria destroy the oxygen-low tumor tissue while sparing the well-oxygenated healthy tissues. A number of bacteria species in genera such as Salmonella, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Caulobacter, Listeria, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Mycobacterium and Proteus have been developed as oncolytic bacteria. One successful strain is the anaerobic Clostridium novyi. The genus Clostridium was shown to cause tumor regression in rodent models, but a subsequent clinical failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit in humans that would outweigh the toxic effects. The inventors and others have shown that C. novyi-NT can selectively germinate and grow in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors after intravenous injection with less toxicity. More recently, the inventors showed that intratumoral injection of C. novyi-NT spores may be a promising approach to facilitate germination and reduce spore dosage needed for germination (Staedke et al. 2016, Dang et al. 2004). This concept has been reevaluated using the attenuated C. novyi-NT strain, which is characterized by a deletion of the lethal toxin gene rendering the bacterium less toxic. However, the challenges of C. novyi-NT cancer therapy remain to be substantial with severe host inflammatory responses and reduced efficacy in clearing up tumor outer rims. There is an unmet need for methods of improving tumor clearance and reducing treatment-related toxicities."

                        "The present invention is based on the seminal discovery that neutrophil accumulation in tumors with germinating bacteria may contribute to blockage preventing certain anaerobic bacteria, for example, C. novyi-NT, from complete tumor clearance.",
                        "Hypoxia is a prominent feature of solid tumors and can function as fertile environment for oncolytic anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium novyi-NT (C. novyi-NT) where it can induce tumor destruction in mice and patients. However, two major obstacles have limited its use, namely the host inflammatory response and the incomplete clearance of normoxic tumor areas. In this study we used a subcutaneous tumor model of a glioblastoma (GBM) cell line in immunocompetent mice to investigate the local distribution of tumor hypoxia, kinetics of C. novyi-NT germination and spread, and the local host immune response. We subsequently applied the acquired knowledge to develop a C. novyi-NT therapy in an orthotopic rabbit brain tumor model. We found that local accumulation of granular leukocytes, mainly neutrophils, could impede the spread of bacteria through the tumor and prevented complete oncolysis. Depletion of neutrophils using anti-Ly6G antibody or bone marrow suppression using hydroxyurea significantly improved tumor clearance. We then applied this approach to rabbits implanted with an aggressive intracranial brain tumor and achieved long term survival in the majority of animals without apparent toxicity. These results indicated that depleting neutrophils can greatly enhance the safety and efficacy of C. novyi-NT cancer therapy for brain tumors and other highly hypoxic tumors.",

The focus was on the deadly glioblastoma, a malignancy arising from the glial tissue in the brain, for which conventional treatment options such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy are limited, with an average life span of 1 to 2 years. When such therapy is applied to the brain, edema might occur due to inflammatory infiltrates, which within the fixed size of the cranial vault may cause fatally raised intracranial pressure. This is particularly challenging in rodents, where the cranial volumes are small (mouse \u02dc440 mm3 and rat 1200 mm3) and animals can easily succumb to brain swelling during germination. For example, the C. novyi-NT germination in intracranial GL261 mouse brain tumor can lead to death of the majority of the mice in our experience (unpublished observation). We thus first developed the neutrophil depletion approach using an immunocompetent subcutaneous mouse glioblastoma tumor model and subsequently tested it in a rabbit brain tumor model, whose brain size around 12,000 mm3 offers significant more space to accommodate the swelling than that of a mouse."

Rabbit VX2 tumor was established from a carcinoma induced by the Shope cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) and passaged via hind limb donor rabbit as described previously (Parvinian et al. 2014). Briefly, a vial of frozen VX2 cells was defrosted in warm water, centrifuged and injected in the hind leg muscle of a donor New Zealand White rabbit to allow several weeks for the tumor to grow. Rabbits were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5-10 mg/kg) and a viable part of tumor within the proliferative rim was excised, minced to small pieces using a scalpel, and dissociated with 1:2 mixture of collagenase (10 mg/ml) and hyaluronidase (1000 unite/ml) in PBS in a flask at 37\u00b0 C. and 200 rpm rotation. Tumor cells were counted and frozen in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics and 10% DMSO, or used for implantation subsequently. For intracranial implantation, 5\u00d7105 VX2 cells in 1.5 \u03bcl DMEM/F12 media were injected 10 mm deep, 4 mm right and 3 mm anterior of the bregma. To prevent tumor cell seeding from the needle tract on the brain surface and the meninges around the burr hole, the burr hole was rinsed with 0.5 \u03bcg/ul doxorubicin in PBS after needle retraction and inserted with a 3 mm gel stick prepared with 0.25 \u03bcg/ul doxorubicin in PBS as described in our previous study (Bai et al. 2017).

                                "Neutrophil Accumulation and Depletion in C. novyi-NT Therapy of Subcutaneous GL261 Tumor",
                                "The neutrophils are the final effector cells of the innate immunity and a major phagocyte in host defense against bacterial pathogen. Neutrophils migrate to the site of infection and use a combination of antimicrobial utilities such as cytotoxic granule contents, antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to generate a highly lethal antibacterial environment. In our study, mouse GL261 glioma cells were implanted in C57BL6 mice subcutaneously and when the tumors reached the sizes of 400-500 mm3, 2\u00d7107 C. novyi-NT spores were injected into three different central areas of the tumor body. This tumor size was selected to ensure consistent C. novyi-NT germination as we observed inconsistent germination in smaller tumor in this model (data not shown). Mice were observed for tumor swelling and hemorrhagic necrosis, and signs for toxicity. Tumors were harvested 24 hrs after the spore injection and staining via H&E and Gram demonstrated extensive germination, accompanied by marked accumulation of polymorphonuclear granulocytes located between the germinating bacteria and remaining viable tumor, mainly around the outer rim area (FIG. 7A). The cell membrane antigen Ly6G is expressed in granulocytes and transiently in some monocytes and is a well defined marker for murine neutrophils, especially the circulating and recruited neutrophils. Immunofluorescence staining of 1A8 anti-Ly6G antibody identified the majority of those cells as neutrophils (FIG. 7A). Those immune cells could be depleted by treating the mice with 1A8 antibody intraperitoneally (IP) 24 hrs before the spore injection (FIG. 1B, FIG. 7B). Staining with anti-CD11b and CD3 antibodies revealed minimal numbers of positive cells among those accumulated immune cells (FIGS. 8A and 8B). Similar depletion was achieved also by daily IP injection of hydroxyurea (HU), an immunosuppressant used in treating myeloproliferative diseases, for 5 days before the spore injection, as indicated by the complete blood count (CBC) of mouse blood (FIG. 1C). The counts of blood cells with the suppression by HU showed also a significant drop of lymphocytes (FIG. 8C). Previous studies have demonstrated substantial mortality rates of C. novyi-NT-treated mice with large subcutaneous CT26 and GL261 tumors (\u02dc700 mm3 or 600-900 mm3). In this study, we used moderate tumor sizes and while germination occurred in all tumors, 2 out of 11 mice ( 2/11) died of treatment-related toxicity within 48 hrs. Of the surviving animals, 8 mice with initial tumor reduction were found later to have tumor regrowth (partial), and 1 mouse was completely cured as determined by absence of any tumor after 3 weeks (FIG. 1D). In contrast, in the cohorts treated with anti-Ly6G 1A8 antibody or HU, 11/15 or 9/12 mice respectively were cured of tumor, 2/15 or 1/12 were partial, and 2/15 or 2/12 died from immediate toxicities, respectively (FIG. 1D). HU or 1A8 antibody alone did not show any noticeable therapeutic effects (data not shown). Bioluminescence imaging of the luciferase-labeled tumor illustrated these therapeutic outcomes (FIG. 1E).",
                                "Tumor Hypoxia and a Model of C. novyi-NT Germination",
                                "While these results demonstrated the essential role of neutrophil defense in preventing complete tumor clearance by C. novyi-NT, they raised the question of how the clearance of whole tumor was achieved as the tumor outer rim areas, which are distant from the necrotic centers and close to blood vessels, are regarded as non-hypoxic in a number of tumor models. In order to investigate the spatial distribution of hypoxia in the flank GL261 tumor, we labeled the tumor with a hypoxia indicator pimonidazole (PMN) via IP injection 90 min before harvesting the tumor. Immunohistochemistry staining of PMN using Hypoxyprobe-1 monoclonal antibody (Mab) that stains tissues with a partial 02 pressure below 10 mmHg, showed a distribution of small hypoxic pockets throughout the tumor rim areas adjacent to surrounding tissues (FIG. 2A). Numerous apparent tumor vessels were also stained positive of bound PMN as exemplified in FIG. 2A and FIG. 9. This distribution pattern of tumor hypoxia was also illustrated by the immunofluorescence (IF) staining of PMN using the same Hypoxyprobe-1 Mab (FIG. 2B). Next, we attempted to visualize the germination process in a time course after C. novyi-NT spore injection in GL261 tumor pretreated with anti-Ly6G antibody for neutrophil depletion. At 6, 8, and 12 hrs following spore injection, GL261 tumors were harvested after 1 hr of PMN labeling. No significant germination was observed in the 3 harvested tumors at 6 hrs (data not shown). After 8 hrs, germination could be determined in some areas of the tumor via IF using rabbit anti-C. novyi-NT antibody. In FIG. 2C, a presumed initial germination site was observed in higher magnification, where the spores, stained as green dots, were found among cell aggregates which were likely accumulated immune cells, surrounded by hypoxic tumor cells stained in red (FIG. 2C). Some germinating bacteria in the rod form were found co-localized with hypoxic tumor cells (FIG. 2C, white arrow head). Macroscopic view of tumors 12 hrs after the spore injection revealed a germination pattern, which appeared to spread from one large germinated area to adjacent small hypoxic pockets (FIGS. 2D and 2E). Pictures of higher magnifications showed that individual C. novyi-NT bacteria were distributed sparsely in the surrounding tumor tissue of a germination area, some of which were found within a hypoxic pocket (FIG. 3A) and initial colonization occurred in such hypoxic pockets (FIGS. 3B-D). Based on this observation, a germination and spreading mechanism has emerged, in which the injected spores germinate first in a hypoxic/necrotic area, then the bacteria powered by flagellum movement randomly migrate into the vicinity to find another hypoxic pocket which they colonize and form a new germination center. In the absence of the intervention of neutrophils, within several hours, ever expanding germination fronts supported by hypoxic pockets presented throughout the tumor body and rim inevitably leading to total destruction of tumor tissue.",
                                "C. novyi-NT Therapy of Orthotopic VX2 Rabbit Brain Tumor",
                                "Rabbit VX2 tumor was established from a carcinoma induced by the Shope cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) and has been widely used as a rabbit intracranial tumor model for various imaging and therapeutic studies. As detailed in the Introduction, we chose the rabbit model to study C. novyi-NT germination for the larger cranial size. VX2 tumor cells were implanted in the right frontal lobe and rabbits became symptomatic with a tilted head, severe reduction of eating and fecal output at day 20-25 after the tumor implantation, which necessitated euthanasia, resulting in a median survival of 21 days for untreated animals (FIG. 5D). C. novyi-NT treatment was initiated relatively late at day 17 after tumor implantation to ensure that a sizable tumor had formed which is needed for IT spore injection to support a robust germination. Histologically, VX2 brain tumor resembled some key features of human glioblastoma, such as necrotic centers and invasive growth pattern observed as small tumor satellites in the surrounding brain tissues (FIGS. 4B and 4C). C. novyi-NT germination in the tumor led to sizable accumulation of neutrophils that prevented bacteria from completely disseminating to the remaining tumor and particularly the outer rim (FIG. 4D). Pre-treatment of rabbits with HU, similar as observed with GL261 model before, was effective in suppressing the intratumoral accumulation of neutrophils, which led to enhanced bacterial tumor eradication. Gram staining of a brain section from a HU-pretreated rabbit 72 hrs after the spore injection revealed an apparent complete tumor clearance with a germinating front (FIG. 5A). Within the surrounding brain tissue, some tumor vessel structures and invading satellites were colonized by C. novyi-NT (FIG. 5B). Due to the lack of available antibody targeting rabbit neutrophils, we compared cyclophosphamide (CPA) and HU for their efficacies in neutrophil depletion. Although both CPA and HU could achieve significant neutrophil suppression, neutrophil counts quickly rebounded within 2 days after spore injection in the CPA cohort, while the rabbits pretreated by HU maintained lower neutrophil counts for at least 3 days after spore injection (FIG. 5C), thereby providing a potential therapeutic window for tumor eradication. At the administered dose, the HU-induced neutrophil suppression was fairly specific as lymphocyte counts were not significantly affected by HU; however, platelets showed a marked drop (FIG. 10). Pretreatment with HU significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy and safety of IT C. novyi-NT therapy and resulted in 8 long-term survivors out of 9 rabbits, with one death owing to tumor regrowth 26 days after spore injection as determined by autopsy and brain sections (FIG. 5D). In comparison, among 6 rabbits injected with C. novyi-NT spores alone without pretreatment, 4 died from immediate toxicities within 2 days, 1 died from tumor regrowth 19 days after spore injection and 1 rabbit achieved long-term survival until euthanized in a healthy condition 342 days after tumor implantation (FIG. 5D). The cohort pretreated with CPA prior to spore injection was inferior to HU and achieved similar results as observed in the C. novyi-NT alone cohort without any long-term survivor.",
                                "Next, we closely examined the rabbits' brain sections in the various treatment regimens. An example of VX2 brain tumor section at the day of C. novyi-NT treatment is shown in FIG. 6A. The brain section of a rabbit that died one day after the spore injection without neutrophil depletion revealed a severely hemorrhagic and expanded lesion with considerable mass effect due to edema compared to the contralateral brain structure (FIG. 6B). This stands in contrast to a \u201ctransformed\u201d lesion (black arrow) of a HU-pretreated rabbit sacrificed in healthy condition 8 days after spore injection (FIG. 6C), which upon closer examination was free of tumor and germinating bacteria but predominantly filled with neutrophils as demonstrated by antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) IHC (brown) (FIG. 6D, FIGS. 11A and 11B). MPO can be released into the surrounding by neutrophils during degranulation to facilitate the killing of bacteria. Of note, neutrophil counts made a rebound around day 3-7 after the C. novyi-NT spore injection (FIG. 5C). As a minority of rabbits in the C. novyi-NT alone group survived the initial germination and died from tumor regrowth (FIG. 5D), we sacrificed another otherwise healthy rabbit on this regimen 8 days after spore injection and observed a restricted lesion filled with neutrophils without germinating bacteria (FIGS. 12A and 12B), however pockets of growing tumor in the former tumor-brain transitional areas were discovered, indicating a partial tumor clearance (FIGS. 12C and 12D).",
                                "Discussion",
                                "In adoptive T cell therapies, preconditioning by lymphodepletion has been incorporated in the treatment protocol to achieve optimal efficacies, which includes using chemotherapeutics such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or full-body radiation. This is presumably facilitated by eliminating regulatory T cells and competing elements of the immune system, which help prolong the persistence of infused cells. In oncolytic virus therapies, preconditioning with immune modulators or complement depletion successfully improved the viral targeting of tumors. So far, immune-modulating pretreatment has not been used in therapies with oncolytic bacteria.",
                                "In this study, we reported the development of a combination therapy of C. novyi-NT and neutrophil reduction, with reduced cytotoxicity and substantially enhanced antineoplastic potency in the orthotopic rabbit brain tumor model and with enhanced efficacy in a subcutaneous mouse glioma model. Neutrophils were rapidly recruited to the tumor sites in response to C. novyi-NT germination and the accumulation of neutrophils inside the tumor caused a barrier that limited the bacterial spread. Drug-induced suppression or antibody-mediated depletion of neutrophils permitted the bacteria to replicate and spread within the tumors unhindered and subsequently, led to considerably enhanced tumor clearance. Importantly, over 70% of animals treated with such combination showed no evidence of tumor recurrence and remained alive compared to <10% in the control. In the orthotopic rabbit brain tumor mode, HU pretreatment also significantly reduced C. novyi-NT-induced toxicity which may be related to the suppression of the myeloid cell populations that are responsible for the release of acute inflammatory cytokines. In animals with tumor recurrence, we suspect that C. novyi-NT could not effectively colonize the peritumoral regions, which are less hypoxic. Those well-vascularized tumor regions are susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs, and thus the combinatorial use of these agents may further improve the treatment efficacy. Although the effectiveness of inflammation suppression to substantially enhance the oncolytic potency was only evaluated in one bacterium, its general applicability to other types of oncolytic bacteria is likely but will need to be validated in relevant animal models. It is worth mentioning that in oncolytic viral therapies, local inflammation and infiltration of immune cells in the tumor tissue are desired and vital for immunogenic killing of the tumor.",
                                "It is notable that the neutrophil-suppressing pretreatment reduced the toxicity-related death in the orthotopic rabbit brain tumor model (4 out of 6 in C. novyi-NT only group vs 0 out of 9 in C. novyi-NT plus HU group in FIG. 5D), while low but largely unchanged toxicity-related death rates were observed in the subcutaneous GL261 mouse model with or without pretreatment (FIG. 1D). The rapid rise of intracranial pressure in the VX2 brain tumor model during germination was likely the main cause of toxicity-related death and a reduction of brain edema indicated by the less inflammatory lesion (FIG. 6C) via suppression of neutrophils has a very sensitive effect on mitigating the animal mortality. Less local infiltration and accumulation of neutrophils and possibly other myeloid cells suppressed by HU may have contributed to the edema reduction and improved safety.",
                                "Hypoxia in solid tumor arises in regions with insufficient oxygen supply, which, in the general view, is attributed principally to the distance to blood vessels. However, in tumors such as glioblastoma, where vasculatures are often disorganized and dysfunctional, and a small percentage of vascular endothelium could be of neoplastic origin, local hypoxia may not necessarily be determined by the distance to the blood vessels. Of note, in human glioblastomas and high-grade astocytomas, oxygen pressure was measured at 9.2\u00b15.8 mmHg or 15.3\u00b12.3 mmHg in intratumoral locations, at 17.9\u00b19.3 mmHg in peritumoral areas and at 59.8\u00b16.5 mmHg in the brain tissue, which is consistent with the PMN staining in this study that labels tissues with oxygen pressure below 10 mmHg. C. novyi can achieve full germination below the oxygen pressure of 7.6 mmHg and tolerate up to 15.2 mmHg. The mouse tumor model in this study was established from subcutaneously implanted GL261 glioblastoma cell line and the PMN-mediated staining revealed a wide distribution of relatively small hypoxic pockets throughout the viable tumor, including the tumor rim. The biological functionality of those hypoxic pockets was essentially validated by focused colonization of germinating C. novyi-NT bacteria. Interestingly, multiple tumor vascular structures were also stained positive of hypoxia, underlying their dysfunctionality. In fact, the origin of tumor hypoxia may involve multiple and complex factors, including hyper respiratory activity in mitochondria as an intrinsic hypoxia generator in the tumor cells. Such intrinsic tumor hypoxia has been measured inconsistently and may vary greatly among different types of tumor cells, generally correlating with the aggressiveness of the tumor, consistent with our unpublished observation. This could indeed present a challenge to therapeutics targeting tumor hypoxia, including C. novyi-NT, in a broad application of different tumor types. When used in treating aggressive brain tumor, however, C. novyi-NT demonstrated promising therapeutic efficacies once we incorporated modulation of immune response to ensure the spread of the bacteria and to reduce side effects. These improvements may lead to the development of safer and more effective oncolytic bacterial treatments for patients with glioblastomas and other poorly vascularized tumors in the future.",
