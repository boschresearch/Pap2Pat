                        "There is a need for improving digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) to improve downstream sugar yield. In one embodiment, a method for size-adjusting LCB particles for use as feedstock for a pretreatment process is provided. In one embodiment, a LCB particle is size-adjusted in a manner that produces particles having an average particle size less than particles produced in a conventional size-adjusting process. In one embodiment, a resulting LCB particle has an average particle size greater than 5 mm in at least one direction.",
                        "In one embodiment, a plurality of LCB particles is provided, having an average particle size between about 1 cm and about 5 cm in at least one dimension.",

In one embodiment, the ammonia pretreatment can be performed above the glass transition temperature of the LCB particle (high severity).",
                        "The use of a protocol which, in one embodiment, finely tunes the size of the starting LCB particles to a size which can be orders of magnitude higher than conventional particles, in order to optimize downstream sugar yields, represents a paradigm shift in the previously understood need to reduce LCB particles down to fine sizes, such as to an average particle size of 5 mm or less. In one embodiment, surprisingly, use of LCB particles larger than 5 mm, such as up to 5 cm or larger, improves sugar yield downstream, as compared with sugar yields using particle sizes 5 mm or smaller. An improved sugar yield can, in turn, improve production yields of various bio-products. As such, in one embodiment, the methods described herein demonstrate an improvement to the efficiency and economy of producing bio-products such as cellulosic biofuels."

Plant biomass can include, but is not limited to, agricultural residues such as corn stover, wheat straw, rice straw, sugar cane bagasse and the like. Plant biomass further includes, but is not limited to, woody energy crops, wood wastes and residues such as trees, including fruit trees, such as fruit-bearing trees, (e.g., apple trees, orange trees, and the like), softwood forest thinnings, barky wastes, sawdust, paper and pulp industry waste streams, wood fiber, and the like. Additionally perennial grass crops, such as various prairie grasses, including prairie cord grass, switchgrass, Miscanthus, big bluestem, little bluestem, side oats grama, and the like, have potential to be produced large-scale as additional plant biomass sources. For urban areas, potential plant biomass feedstock includes yard waste (e.g., grass clippings, leaves, tree clippings, brush, etc.) and vegetable processing waste. Plant biomass is known to be the most prevalent form of carbohydrate available in nature and corn stover is currently the largest source of readily available plant biomass in the United States.

Most biofuels are originally derived from biological processes such as the photosynthesis process and can therefore be considered a solar or chemical energy source. Other biofuels, such as natural polymers (e.g., chitin or certain sources of microbial cellulose), are not synthesized during photosynthesis, but can nonetheless be considered a biofuel because they are biodegradable. There are generally considered to be three types of biofuels derived from biomass synthesized during photosynthesis, namely, agricultural biofuels (defined below), municipal waste biofuels (residential and light commercial garbage or refuse, with most of the recyclable materials such as glass and metal removed) and forestry biofuels (e.g., trees, waste or byproduct streams from wood products, wood fiber, pulp and paper industries). Biofuels produced from biomass not synthesized during photosynthesis include, but are not limited to, those derived from chitin, which is a chemically modified form of cellulose known as an N-acetyl glucosamine polymer. Chitin is a significant component of the waste produced by the aquaculture industry because it comprises the shells of seafood.",

                        "The term \u201cpretreatment step\u201d as used herein, refers to any step intended to alter native biomass so it can be more efficiently and economically converted to reactive intermediate chemical compounds such as sugars, organic acids, etc., which can then be further processed to a variety of end products such as ethanol, iso-butanol, long chain alkanes etc. Pretreatment can reduce the degree of crystallinity of a polymeric substrate, reduce the interference of lignin with biomass conversion and prehydrolyze some of the structural carbohydrates, thus increasing their enzymatic digestibility and accelerating the degradation of biomass to useful products. Pretreatment methods can utilize acids of varying concentrations, including dilute acid pretreatments, concentrated acid pretreatments (using, for example, sulfuric acids, hydrochloric acids, organic acids, and the like) and/or alkali such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lime, and the like. Pretreatment methods can additionally or alternatively utilize hydrothermal treatments including water, heat, steam or pressurized steam pretreatments, including, but not limited to, hydro-thermolysis pretreatment and liquid hot water pretreatment, further including, for example, acid catalyzed steam explosion pretreatment. Pretreatment can occur or be deployed in various types of containers, reactors, pipes, flow through cells and the like. Most pretreatment methods will cause the partial or full solubilization and/or destabilization of lignin and/or hydrolysis of hemicellulose to pentose sugars. Further examples of pretreatment include, but are not limited wet oxidation, organosolv pretreatment and mechanical extrusion.",

An AFEX\u2122 pretreatment disrupts the lignocellulosic matrix, thus modifvin2 the structure of lignin, partially hydrolyzing hemicellulose, and increasing the accessibility of cellulose and the remaining hemicellulose to subsequent enzymatic degradation. Lignin is a primary impediment to enzymatic hydrolysis of native biomass, and removal or transformation of lignin is a suspected mechanism of several of the leading pretreatment technologies, including AFEX\u2122. The process further expands and swells cellulose fibers and further breaks up amorphous hemicellulose in LCB. These structural changes open up the plant cell wall structure enabling more efficient and complete conversion of LCB to value-added products while preserving the nutrient value and composition of the material. Modified AFEX\u2122 pretreatments further include, for example extractive AFEX\u2122 (E-AFEX\u2122).",

When lignin softens up, the ammonia helps to break hemicellulose-lignin ester linkages in LCB particles. A glass transition temperature can be reached during a pretreatment process, such as an ammonia pretreatment process.",

Moisture content is usually expressed on a dry weight basis (dwb) as follows: MCdwb={(Wi\u2212Wf)/Wf}*100 wherein Wi is the initial weight of biomass before drying and Wf is the final weight of biomass after drying.",
                        "The term \u201cparticle\u201d as used herein refers to an individual piece of biomass, such as LCB (i.e., an \u201cLCB particle\u201d). A LCB is useful as a starting material for various biofuel production processes and can include an \u201cas is\u201d harvested piece of biomass (whole biomass) or a size-adjusted piece of biomass (after milling or chopping). When used without qualification, the term \u201cparticle\u201d is intended to refer to an \u201cLCB particle.\u201d",

                        "The major structural components of biomass feedstocks are cellulose (glucan), lignin (Klason lignin, acid soluble lignin), hemicellulose (primarily made up of xylan) and ash. Other sugars that make up the structural component are galactan, arabinan and mannan. Non-structural components of LCB that are generally measured are extractives and proteins.",
                        "Nearly all forms of ligno-cellulosic biomass, i.e., plant biomass, such as monocots, comprise three primary chemical fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Hemicellulose is a polymer of short, highly-branched chains of mostly five-carbon pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose), and to a lesser extent six-carbon hexose sugars (galactose, glucose and mannose). Dicots, on the other hand, have a high content of pectate and/or pectin, which is a polymer of alpha-linked glucuronic acid. Pectate may be \u201cdecorated\u201d with mannose or rhamnose sugars, also). Some of these sugars are acetylated.",
                        "Because of its branched structure, hemicellulose is amorphous and relatively easy to hydrolyze (breakdown or cleave) to its individual constituent sugars by enzyme or dilute acid treatment. Cellulose is a linear polymer of glucose sugars, much like starch, which is the primary substrate of corn grain in dry grain and wet mill ethanol plants. However, unlike starch, the glucose sugars of cellulose are strung together by \u03b2-glycosidic linkages which allow cellulose to form closely-associated linear chains. Because of the high degree of hydrogen bonding that can occur between cellulose chains, cellulose forms a rigid crystalline structure that is highly stable and much more resistant to hydrolysis by chemical or enzymatic attack than starch or hemicellulose polymers.",
                        "Hemicelluloses of rice straw comprise primarily \u03b1-L-(1-3)-arabino-(4-O-methyl-\u03b1-(1-2)-D-glucurono)-\u03b2-(1-4)-D-xylanand arabino-glucuronoxylan, (AGX). Xylan backbone \u03b2-(1-4)-D-xylopyranosyl units are substituted by monomeric 4-O-methyl-\u03b1-D-glucopyranosyluronic acid residue (4-O-MeGlcA) and a \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosyl unit at the C2 and/or C3 main chain. A significant portion of the xylose in cereal straw cell walls was also acetylated, primarily on C2 and C3, with the acetyl group accounting for about 1 to about 5% (by weight) of the total LCB.",
                        "Lignin provides structural integrity to plants, and remains as residual material after the sugars in plant biomass have been fermented to ethanol. Lignin exists in plant tissue as a polymer of phenolic molecules, and is associated with cellulose, hemicelluloses and other polymers as lignin-carbohydrates complexes (LCCs) through covalent bonds. In herbaceous plants such as rice straw, LCCs contain ferulic bridges which are attached to lignin and carbohydrates (AGX) via ether and ester bonds, respectively. Alkali cleaves the ester bond components of such bridges, liberating the ferulic acid (FA) residue and lignin from carbohydrates and yielding a small amount of FA (1-4%). Isolated LCCs from rice straw is known to contain about 64% carbohydrates, about 3% uronic acid, about 33% lignin, about 4% acetyl groups, 4% trans-p-coumaric acid and about 1% trans-ferulic acid. Typical ranges of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin concentrations in plants are shown in Pauly, M., et. al., Plant cell wall polymers as precursors for biofuels, Curr Opin Plant Biol. June 2010: 13(3):305-12. Typically, cellulose makes up 30 to 50% of residues from agricultural, municipal, and forestry sources. While cellulose is more difficult to convert to ethanol than hemicellulose, it is the sugar polymers of hemicellulose which can be more readily hydrolyzed to their individual component sugars for subsequent fermentation to ethanol. Although hemicellulose sugars represent the \u201clow-hanging\u201d fruit for conversion to ethanol, the substantially higher content of cellulose represents the greater potential for maximizing alcohol yields, such as ethanol, on a per ton basis of plant biomass.",
                        "Therefore, a pretreatment process is used to alter and open up the cell wall matrix, to hydrolyze the hemicelluloses, and to reduce crystallinity. Ultimately, the pretreatment process makes the cellulose more accessible (during a subsequent enzyme hydrolysis process) for conversion of the carbohydrate polymer into fermentable sugars.",
                        "Conventional methods used to convert biomass to alcohol include processes employing a concentrated acid hydrolysis pretreatment, a two-stage acid hydrolysis pretreatment as well as processes employing any known conventional pretreatment, such as hydrothermal or chemical pretreatments, followed by an enzymatic hydrolysis (i.e., enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis) or simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis and saccharification. Such pretreatment methods can include, but are not limited to, dilute acid hydrolysis, high pressure hot water-based methods, i.e., hydrothermal treatments such as steam explosion and aqueous hot water extraction, reactor systems (e.g., batch, continuous flow, counter-flow, flow-through, and the like), AFEX\u2122, ammonia recycled percolation (ARP), lime treatment and a pH-based treatment.",
                        "Several of these methods generate nearly complete hydrolysis of the hemicellulose fraction to efficiently recover high yields of the soluble pentose sugars. This also facilitates the physical removal of the surrounding hemicellulose and lignin, thus exposing the cellulose to later processing.",
                        "However, ammonia treatments, such as ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX\u2122), are capable of opening up the cell wall in agricultural residues with greatly reduced degradation products, as compared to acidic pretreatments.",
                        "Various types of LCB can be used in the processes described herein, including, but not limited to, perennial and/or annual grasses (e.g., rice straw, Micanthus, switchgrass, sugar cane bagasse, wheat straw, Napier grass, Erianthus, empty fruit bunch from palm trees, and the like). Rice straw, for example, is one of the most plentiful LCB crop residues in the world. Approximately 60% of a rice crop production is rice straw, which is composed of leaf and sheath (53%), stem (44%) and panicles (3%) when cut at ground level. Many farmers openly burn rice straw to clean the rice field, as it offers a relatively inexpensive means of removing straw and clearing the rice field for subsequent planting. However, this option creates environmental, safety and health issues. As such, there is a need to find alternative ways to remove the rice straw after each harvesting season.",
                        "However, conversion of LCB, such as rice straw, to biofuel (e.g., ethanol) is more challenging than conversion of starchy materials, such as corn, due to the complex structure of the plant cell wall. Attempts to use rice straw and other LCB have, to date, focused on a perceived need to reduce the size of the LCB particle size to a magnitude of order of just a few millimeters or less (e.g., less than 5 mm), to improve the downstream sugar conversion rate. One goal of size reduction has been to reduce the crystallinity of the cellulose fibers in the biomass. Indeed, in addition to chemical pretreatment, such size reduction has heretofore been recommended as part of any physical pretreatment process for LCB particles. Size reduction of LCB particles to produce fine LCB particle sizes has also been thought to be necessary to eliminate the mass and heat transfer limitations during pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis. Significant size reduction of harvested LCB particles, such as with reduction to particle sizes from 0.85-0.5 mm to <0.15 mm has been demonstrated to enhance glucan and xylan conversions by 15-20%. However, extensive size reduction is not only expensive, but can also cause significant carbohydrate losses, ultimately resulting in less sugar production and reduced ethanol yield.",
                        "The inventors have determined, surprisingly, and in contrast to conventional wisdom, that downstream sugar yield increases as the size (e.g., average size) of the starting material (LCB particles) is increased, when using a substrate containing LCB particles having a size greater than 5 mm in at least one dimension, as compared to LCB particles having a size of 5 mm or less in any dimension. This trend holds true for much larger LCB particles up to an order of magnitude larger in size, such as up to about 5 cm in at least one dimension, and likely is true for even larger LCB particles, such as up to 10 cm in at least one dimension, although the embodiments are not so limited. More specifically, when using a LCB substrate as a starting material for the production of bio-products, such as biofuel, together with a suitable pretreatment process, the resulting downstream sugar yield (monomeric and oligomeric sugars) increases. In one embodiment, the particles of a given substrate, which are generally similar in size, as noted in the definition, and can pass through an approximately 0.5 cm sieve when milling.",
                        "The total possible theoretical sugar yield for a given biomass is calculated based on the composition of glucan, xylan and arabinan present in biomass. To convert polymeric sugars to monomerics sugars, a multiple of 1.11 is used for glucan and 1.136 for xylan and arabinan. Therefore, the maximum theoretical sugar yield for rice straw is 639.1 g/kg of biomass for 100% conversion.",
                        "In one embodiment, sugar conversion using larger LCB particles is increased by at least 1% up to about 26% or higher, including any range or value therebetween, such as up to about 40% or higher. In one embodiment, sugar conversion is increased by at least 26%. For example, it is known that a conventional LCB particle size of 5 mm pretreated under AC2RS conditions (as defined herein) at 6% GL produces a sugar yield of 325 g/kg of biomass, i.e., a conversion of only 50%. In contrast, in one embodiment, the larger non-conventional LCB particle size of 5 cm in at least one dimension, when pretreated under AC2RS conditions at 6% GL hydrolysis surprisingly produces a much higher sugar yield of 486 g/kg, i.e., a conversion of 76%. This ability to convert 150 g/kg more from biomass to sugar represents a 26% increase.",
                        "In one embodiment, xylose yield is increased by at least 1% up to about 22%, including any range or value therebetween, or higher, depending on the particular LCB particle size or ratio of LCB particle sizes (between 5 mm and about 5 cm, including any range or value therebetween, or higher), the pretreatment conditions and the GL. In one embodiment, xylose yield is increased by at least or about 22%, again, depending on the particular LCB particle size or ratio of LCB particle sizes (between 5 mm and about 5 cm, including any range or value therebetween or higher), the pretreatment conditions and the GL.",
                        "In one embodiment, low severity pretreatment conditions, i.e., wherein the pretreatment reaction temperature is lower than the glass transition temperature of lignin present in LCB. However, the temperature and/or the residence time should not be so low as to cause an ineffective pretreatment step that would prevent or reduce the effectiveness of a subsequent hydrolysis step. In one embodiment, low severity pretreatment conditions include heating the LCB particles to a temperature less than or equal to 100\u00b0 C. for a residence time of no more than or about 60 minutes.",
                        "In one embodiment, high severity pretreatment conditions, i.e., wherein the pretreatment reaction temperature is higher than the glass transition temperature of lignin present in LCB, are used.",
                        "In one embodiment, such conditions can include heating the LCB particles to a temperature of at least or above 120\u00b0 C. for a residence time of at least or about 60 min.",
                        "Clearly, temperatures in between about 100\u00b0 C. and about 160\u00b0 C. can be used, as well as residence times between about 30 and about 60 minutes. Depending on the glass transition temperature of the LCB particles being treated, such a process can be either a low severity or high severity process.",
                        "In theory, to go beyond the glass transition temperature of lignin for a given LCB (at fixed ammonia loading and fixed moisture), one has to raise pretreatment temperature beyond a certain temperature range and maintain the conditions for certain residence time.",
                        "In one embodiment, the process operates under low severity pretreatment conditions for a period of time before operating under high severity pretreatment conditions.

In contrast to glucan, the \u201cextractives\u201d values in Table 1 exclude the identified extractives, i.e., soluble sugars, soluble oligo sugars and soluble protein since these values are already reported in their correct constituents, i.e., glucan.

During the two-stage acid hydrolysis step of compositional analysis, the newly re-deposited lignin was released in the form of acid soluble lignin, as indicated by an increase in the amount of total extractives. The increase in nitrogen levels in both AC1RS and AC2RS was mainly due to the chemical reaction between ammonia and biomass during the AFEX\u2122 pretreatment itself.",

This may indicate that with the higher reaction temperature (140\u00b0 C.) of AC2RS, more ammonia was able to penetrate the cellulose resulting in formation of ammonia-cellulose complexes. This formation likely led to the incorporation of ammonia into the cellulose crystal lattice, causing lattice transformation and crystal plane widening, known as a \u201cswelling effect.\u201d Most of the ester linkages were likely broken during this process resulting in solubilization of lignin residues and re-deposition on the surface when ammonia was removed from the reactor.",

In this testing, the increase in the total extractives of AC1RS and AC2RS substrates after water and ethanol extractions indicated that AFEX\u2122 pretreatment chemically cleaved the structure of lignin and AGX in LCCs. The cleaved hemicelluloses and lignin residues were then easily extracted and solubilized. The total extractives extracted from the rice straw, including the water soluble products, acid soluble lignin, soluble proteins, soluble salts and minerals, and other minor components, significantly increased as the severity of the pretreatment increased, with the AC1RS substrate containing 25.3% extractives and AC2RS treated rice straw containing 30.2% soluble extractives (URS: 14%).",

As shown, increasing the particle size from 2 mm to 5 cm in the enzymatic hydrolysis at 1% GL increased the n value for AFEX\u2122 pretreated rice straw.

The combination of Spezyme\u00ae CP and Novozyme\u00ae 188, used in the hydrolysis, could not efficiently hydrolyze the oligomeric xylose to monomeric xylose due to insufficient \u03b2-xylosidase activity in the enzyme preparations. Coupled with fast hydrolysis of xylan to oligomeric xylose, this led to the high concentration of oligomeric xylose and low concentrations of monomeric xylose, particularly in small particle size AC2RS substrates. This condition probably inhibited the cellulase activity and reduced the cellulose hydrolysis which led to high concentrations of oligomeric glucose in small particle size AC2RS substrates.",
                                "However, hydrolysis of larger-sized (cm range) AC1RS and AC2RS-substrates at 3% GL showed a different trend as compared to smaller-sized (mm range) AC1RS and AC2RS substrates at the same GL. Both AC2RS-2 cm and AC2RS-5 cm substrates produced the highest glucose/xylose concentrations among all substrates at 3% GL hydrolysis (Table 3). At low (1%) and high (3% and 6%) GL hydrolysis, AC2RS-5 cm substrate behaved very differently than AC 1RS-5 cm substrate. The former gave the highest glucose and xylose concentrations after 72/168 h of hydrolysis even at high solid loading (3% and 6% GL) while the latter yielded the lowest sugar concentrations at all GTA (FIGS. 7A and 7B). The substrate of AC2RS-5 cm completely disintegrated and solubilized into water and left only fine and \u201cpowdery-looking\u201d particles, even when the solid loading of the hydrolysis was increased as previously shown (FIGS. 3A-3D). The Chrastil kinetic model indicates that for hydrolysis at 3% GL, AC2RS-5 cm had the highest n and k values (0.616 and 0.0345 L/g\u00b7h) followed by AC2RS-2 cm substrates (0.528 and 0.0323 L/g\u00b7h) while AC1RS-5 cm gave low k value (0.0282 L/g\u00b7h) at a reasonably high n value (0.509). These kinetic parameters showed that the large particle size substrates, when severely pretreated with the AFEX\u2122 C2 condition, actually had less diffusion resistance with increased catalytic hydrolysis properties, compared to the smaller particle size. This interpretation of hydrolysis kinetics was visually confirmed with SEM imaging analysis of AC2RS.",
                                "FIGS. 7A and 7B compare the glucan and xylan conversion after 168 hr of hydrolysis at GL of 1%, 3% and 6% for AC1RS and AC2RS substrates having a particle size of about 2 mm, 5 mm and 5 cm. Theoretically, when the solid loading in the hydrolysis is increased, sugar concentrations should increase. From FIGS. 7A and 7B, it is clear that the concentrations of monomeric and oligomeric glucose/xylose for most substrates increased while glucan conversions decreased as the solid loading increased from 1% to 6% GL. The AC2RS-5 cm substrates continued to give the highest sugar concentrations (including the oligomeric sugars) and conversions at higher GL. After 168 hr hydrolysis, the glucose/xylose concentrations and glucan/xylan conversions were found to be 30.2 g/L/16.52 g/L and 90.7%/84.1% respectively at 3% GL and 67.47 g/L/38.38 g/L and 89.4%/82.5 respectively at 6% GL.",
                                "However, hydrolysis of AC2RS-2 mm and AC2RS-5 mm substrates at 6% GL showed less favorable results. At the end of 168 hr, the hydrolysis of both sizes of the smaller-sized AC2RS substrates at 6% GL produced extremely low concentrations of monomeric sugars, even lower than the concentrations at 3% GL, and some amount of cellobiose remained in the hydrolysate (shown in oligomeric glucose concentration).",
                                "Poor hydrolysis of small-sized AC2RS substrates at high GL (3% and 6%) were affected by the combined effect of pretreatment severity and diffusion limitation (low n and k values) as previously explained. As the hydrolysis progressed, the substrates were quickly hydrolyzed and fragmented into smaller sugar polymers and finally into cellobiose.",
                                "FIG. 7C shows the sugar yield for hydrolysis at different GLs per dry weight of AC1RS and AC2RS (2 mm, 5 mm and 5 cm). The yield of monomeric glucose and xylose decreased while the yield of oligomeric glucose and xylose increased when the GL increased from 1% to 6%. Among the substrates, AC2RS-5 cm demonstrated a consistent decreasing sugar yield as the GL increased. Hydrolysis at 6% GL revealed that the highest sugar yield was given by AC2RS-5 cm with a yield of 486.12 g/kg of rice straw (76% of the total theoretical maximum sugar yield with an average conversion of 85.9% from total glucan and xylan). On the other hand, AC1RS-5 cm gave the lowest sugar yield with only 107. 6 g/kg of rice straw, about 16.8% of the total theoretical maximum sugar yield, and equivalent to one-quarter of the AC2RS-5 cm sugar yield. As for AC1RS substrates, hydrolysis at 6% GL indicated that AC1RS-2 mm also could produce reasonable sugar yields with 400.6 g/kg of rice straw (62% of the total theoretical maximum sugar yield).",
                                "Two optimized AFEX\u2122 pretreatment conditions of different severities were successfully used to pretreat different particle sizes of rice straw, from conventionally-sized LCB particles of 5 mm or less, as well as larger-sized LCB particles having at least one dimension greater than 5 mm, up to about 5 cm. Regardless of the method of processing the rice straw, for a given size, AC2RS substrates achieved higher downstream sugar yields as compared to AC1RS substrates, thus demonstrating the greater effectiveness of AC2RS conditions.",
                                "While AC1RS substrates showed declining sugar yields as the size of-the substrates increased, surprisingly, AC2RS substrates demonstrated increasing sugar yields between smaller and larger-sized substrates. As with smaller-sized AC1RS substrates, the smaller-sized (conventional) AC2RS substrates also showed decreasing sugar yields as the particle size increased.",
                                "Surprisingly, larger particle size AC2RS substrates exhibited an increasing sugar yield when the substrate size increased. When treated using different AFEX\u2122 conditions, the larger rice straw particles (5 cm) demonstrated different digestion patterns during enzymatic hydrolysis. While the AC1RS-5 cm substrate hydrolyzed slowly and solids remained intact with minor physical disintegration, the AC2RS-5 cm substrate completely disintegrated after the same period of hydrolysis and only left fine particles in the hydrolysate. The Chrastil diffusion-limited kinetic model was able to model the experimental data and explain the hydrolysis behavior at different particle size based on kinetic parameters, k and n. Analysis of SEM imaging supported our interpretation of the experimental hydrolysis behavior and kinetic data."

In such an embodiment, an ammonia to lignocellulosic biomass ratio can be, for example, between about 0.5:1 and about 4:1 and a moisture content of the lignocellulosic biomass can be, for example, between about 10% and 130%, on a dry weight basis.

In one embodiment, downstream sugar yield is increased by at least 1% up to about 150% or higher as compared with the low severity pretreatment.",

Such particles can be hydrolyzed with one or more enzymes, such as a cellulase enzyme or a beta-glucosidase enzyme.",
                                "A method of using a substrate to increase downstream sugar yield is also provided, such method comprising pretreating the substrate containing size-adjusted lignocellulosic biomass particles (LCB) with a pretreatment (e.g., ammonia pretreatment) to increase the downstream sugar yield, wherein the LCB particles have an average particle size in at least one dimension greater than 5 mm.",
                                "In various embodiments, a system is also provided, comprising, for example, a size-adjusting device for producing size-adjusted non-fine biomass; and a pretreatment facility for pretreating the size adjusted biomass to produce pretreated size-adjusted biomass, wherein the pretreated size-adjusted biomass increases sugar yield in a bio-product production facility as compared to fine biomass. Such a system can further comprise the bio-product production facility. The bioproduct can be, for example, a biofuel (ethanol, butanol) or animal feed. The size-adjusted non-fine biomass can have, in one embodiment, an average particle size greater than 5 mm in at least one dimension. In one embodiment, the size-adjusted non-fine biomass has an average particle size between about 1 cm and 10 cm.",
                                "Until now, it had been generally understood that fine grinding and/or milling of harvested LCB to average particle sizes below 5 mm resulted in a better yield under certain conditions by creating additional surface area which allowed the enzymes used for hydrolysis to more efficiently contact the LCB. In contrast, and surprisingly, even with use of larger particles, downstream sugar yield is improved. This is likely due to the presence of additional extractive material which has been solubilized by ammonia and re-deposited on the surface of the LCB particles after pretreatment (see FIGS. 6A-6I). In fact, rather than having less surface area, it appears that the additional extractive material produced with the non-fine LCB particles causes the LCB particles to become more porous, which actually increases the amount of surface area available on which the enzyme can act. This may be the reason that, in one embodiment, a higher digestibility, i.e., a higher sugar conversion, is observed with a high severity pretreatment, rather than a low severity pretreatment.",
                                "Additionally, use of conventionally-sized LCB particles which are less than 5 mm in size and/or with a particle size distribution of from about 0.2 mm to about 5 mm, including any value or range therebetween, form a solution containing fine particulates after pretreatment. Such a solution has an appearance comparable to that of \u201cmud\u201d or a \u201cthick muddy solution.\u201d In contrast, use of LCB particles greater than 5 mm in size (in at least one dimension) up to about 5 cm in size or higher (in at least one dimension) in the embodiments described herein, including any size distribution therebetween, can form, in one embodiment, a particulate-containing solution having a viscosity comparable to that of either water or a \u201cthin muddy solution.\u201d",
                                "While not wishing to be bound by this proposed theory, it is possible that the fine particulate-containing solution resulting from use of conventionally sized particles (e.g., less than 5 mm in size in any dimension), reduces mass transfer rates and thus enzyme hydrolysis while the larger particles described herein produce a solution which results in greater mass transfer rates and hence improved enzyme hydrolysis, as compared with the conventional method.",
                                "The various embodiments described herein have a further benefit of providing cost reduction, since less energy is expended in the size-adjusting step as compared to conventional methods. Specifically, rather than requiring fine grinding, crushing and/or fine milling of LCB particles, which can be quite difficult for some portions of the LCB, such as the stems, the mechanical processing step used herein is more economical. As such, the size-adjusting step in the embodiments described herein can involve milling, cutting, and/or chopping of the LCB particles into non-fine particle sizes (i.e., average particle size greater than 5 mm) With this process, the starting materials used herein for production of a bio-product from LCB are produced at less cost than the starting materials produced using conventional methods. If desired, one can perform the pretreatment process using the non-fine LCB particles as described herein, and then size reduce the pretreated LCB particles to any desired smaller size after pretreatment, prior to hydrolysis and/or fermentation.",
                                "Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any procedure that is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown. For example, although the process has been discussed using rice straw, other types of LCB can likely also be used, such as \u201cempty fruit bunch\u201d i.e., a material obtained from oil palm/date palm trees after removing the fruits the fibrous bunch. Furthermore, although the pretreatment has been discussed primarily as an ammonia pretreatment, it is possible that other pretreatments, as defined herein, can work as well. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present subject matter. Therefore, it is manifestly intended that embodiments of this invention be limited only by the claims and the equivalents thereof."
