    "abstract": "Disclosed are a method for early, sensitively and reliably detecting and distinguishing intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in a malignant tumor occurring primarily in the liver in a simple way, and a kit therefor. In the method, a glycan biomarker consisting of a lectin WFA (Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin)-binding glycoprotein derived from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is used as a cancer marker to detect intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by detecting the cancer marker in a test specimen. The method for detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can clearly differentiate intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and enables early detection and determination with a performance clinically acceptable in terms of applicability, sensitivity and precision.",

                        "Cancer is in the first place among death cause diseases in Japan, and fatalities therefrom are way ahead of those from other diseases such as cardiac diseases and brain diseases. Cancer occurs in all organs and progresses to invade and metastasize to various organs. Thus, to perform effective therapy for cancer, it is most important to treat the cancer at a treatable stage by early detection. Currently, the development of various diagnostic methods and early detection by diagnosis have become possible, which leads to early therapy to prolong life. However, despite the development of various diagnostic and therapeutic methods, invasion and metastasis from a primary lesion complicate therapy and follow a course leading to death.",
                        "Liver cancer is a malignant tumor present in the liver. Liver cancer can be divided into a primary liver cancer occurring primarily in the liver and a metastatic liver cancer resulting from the metastasis of a cancer species having occurred in an organ other than the liver into the liver. As major malignant tumors occurring in the liver (primary liver cancers), there are hepatocellular carcinoma derived from liver cells and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (or cholangiocellular carcinoma) derived from biliary epithelial cells. There is also a cancer considered to be their mixed type. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor derived from liver cells and accounts for 90% or more of primary liver cancers. Almost all the hepatocellular carcinoma occurs from viral hepatitis. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a cancer accounting for 3% of primary liver cancers and is considered to find difficulty in early detection, have a low survival rate after surgical resection, be poorly responsive to chemotherapy, and have poor prognosis.",
                        "For the early detection of liver cancer, the development of a detection device using a tumor marker has previously been under way. For hepatocellular carcinoma, to date many markers for cancer detection have been developed. For example, \u03b11 fetoprotein (AFP) is clinically used as a tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, and PIVKA-II (New Eng. J. Med. 310: 1427-1431, 1984) is also utilized as a tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma. Other known examples of the tumor marker for liver cancer include CEA, CA19-9, KMO-1, DuPAN-2, Span-1, CA50, SLX, basic fetoprotein (BFP), NCC-S, T-439, alkaline phosphatase isozyme, \u03b3-GTP isozyme, IAP, TPA, \u03b22-microglobulin, ferritin, POA, and trypsin inhibitor (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-323499).",
                        "In recent years, many tumor markers for hepatocellular carcinoma are disclosed, which consist of genes and polypeptides expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. For example, tumor markers for hepatocellular carcinoma are disclosed, which consist of genes and polypeptides including Gla incomplete blood coagulation factor VII (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 08-184594), aldolase \u03b2 gene, carbamoyl phosphate synthase I gene, plasminogen gene, EST51549, albumin gene, cytochrome P-450 subfamily 2E1 gene, retinol binding protein gene or organic anion transporter C gene (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-105013), human gene ZNFN3A1 having zinc finger and SET domains (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. 2005-511023), glypican-3 (GPC3) (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. 2005-526979) as a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and development and differentiation enhancing factor 1 (DDEFL1) (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. 2005-503176) located in the region of chromosomal band 1p36.13 and controlling the reformation of the actin cytoskeleton.",
                        "In addition, tumor markers for hepatocellular carcinoma are disclosed, which consist of genes and polypeptides including the presence of deletion in the chromosome region 8p12, 16p13.2-p13.3, 16q23.1-q24.3 or 19p13.2-p13.3 (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2006-94726), Wnt-1 encoding a secretory cysteine-rich protein family (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-139742), genes of carbamoyl phosphate synthase L chain MGC47816 and protein HES6 comprising helix loop-helix main and orange domains (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. 2007-506425), a cell-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) protein consisting of SEMA5A (semaphorin 5A), SLC2A2 (solute carrier family member), ABCC2 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2) or HAL (histidine ammonia lyase) (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. 2007-534722), or human \u03b12,6 sialyltransferase (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-322373).",
                        "A hepatocellular carcinoma marker in which attention is focused on a constitutive glycan group of a glycoprotein in the serum has recently been disclosed as a marker highly specific for hepatocellular carcinoma (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-278803). The hepatocellular carcinoma marker consists of a hepatocellular carcinoma marker consisting of a trisialyl glycan disappearing or decreasing with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma using the tumor marker has been shown to be performed by using a labeled glycan and calculating the amount of the hepatocellular carcinoma marker prepared from a sample through separation using an ion-exchange column and analysis by an elution pattern in high performance liquid chromatography employing an ODS silica column.",
                        "Several tumor markers for detecting cholangiocarcinomas including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are also disclosed. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication (Translation of PCT Application) No. 2003-527583 discloses the use of a trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) as a marker for detecting bile duct-pancreas cancer species; Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2005-304497 discloses the use of at least one genomic gene selected from the group consisting of ZNF131, DOC2, DAB2, PC4, SKP2, CDH10, CDH12, TERT, CDK5, BA11, PSCA, MLZE, RECQL4, BCL1, FGF4, ITGB4, Survivin, SRC, PTPN1, PCTK1, and CTAG, as a gene marker for cholangiocarcinoma; WO2005/023301 discloses the use of an anti-glypican 3 antibody as a diagnostic agent for cholangiocarcinoma; and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-72952 discloses the use of nucleotides constituting the base sequence of one gene except claudin 4 or at least 2 genes selected from the group consisting of (1) insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), (2) claudin 4 (CLDN4), (3) PDZ and LIM domain 7 (PDLIM7), and (4) Biglycan (BGN), as a marker for detecting cholangiocarcinoma. The relation between cholangiocarcinoma and claudin 4 per se is reported in \u201cModern Pathology 19: 460-469 (2006)\u201d.",
                        "From a standpoint of a strategy or the like for overcoming bile duct tumors including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and mixed-type hepatocellular carcinoma in which both of the components can be identified, in primary liver cancer is important. Cytokeratin has previously been used as a tissue marker, and attention has recently been given to new markers such as EpCAM. However, because these existing markers show positivity in not only cholangiocarcinoma but also the normal bile duct and the peripheral interstitial area, there is a need for the development of a marker more specific for cholangiocarcinoma (Cytokeratinl: Oncology Rep. 17: 737-741, 2007; Cytokeratin2: Med.Pathology 9: 901-909, 1996; EpCAM1: Gastoroenterology 136: 1012-1024, 2009; EpCAM2: Cancer Res. 68: 1451-1461, 2008).",
                        "As described above, for the early detection of liver cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, many markers for detecting cancer are disclosed; however, since most of the tumor markers are tumor markers for liver cancer consisting of genes or polypeptides expressed in liver cancer, they impose many constraints as detection device for early detecting and diagnosing liver cancer to be accurately and simply used on a clinical site in view of problems of clinical applicability such as a complex operation for detecting the gene expression and the detection precision for specifically detecting a cancer species and in terms of the sensitivity and precision of the differential diagnosis of a cancer species or the cancer detection, and are therefore not necessarily satisfactory. The method for detecting the occurrence of liver cancer using a gene expressed in liver cancer as a tumor marker cannot also be applied to a case where bile or the like is used as a test specimen."

Although as primary liver cancers there exist hepatocellular carcinoma derived from liver cells and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma occurring in biliary epithelial cells, early detection and suitable therapy based on accurate differential diagnosis are expected to result in cure in both of the carcinomas. Particularly, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma requires early detection and accurate diagnosis because it has a low survival rate after surgical resection compared to hepatocellular carcinoma.

The method for detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma according to the present invention can clearly differentiate intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and enables early detection and determination with a performance clinically acceptable in terms of applicability, sensitivity and precision. In addition, it enables the detection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in a way applicable on a clinical site by a simple procedure.",

Examples of the antibody recognizing the lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein and binding thereto can include antibodies obtained using CA125, N-CAM-L1, Maspin, and MUC1 as antigens.",

For the mixed-type liver cancer which occurs at a rate of several percent of the primary livers cancer and is concurrent liver cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the discriminative diagnosis thereof is important because a therapeutic strategy is different between liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Because cytokeratin, EpCAM, and the like currently in use are not specific for cholangiocarcinoma, it is expected that the use of the above candidate molecules as discriminative markers can contribute to an improvement in the accuracy of diagnosis. Since other candidate molecules are observed to be also expressed in cancers other than cholangiocarcinoma, they are less useful as a tissue marker; however, it is possible that a combination thereof with WFA in the bile and the serum enables the discrimination of cholangiocarcinoma patients from other disease patients and healthy individuals.",

When the method for detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma according to the present invention is performed using the sandwich method, the \u201cantibody recognizing the lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein and binding thereto\u201d is preferably provided in the form of solid-phasing the antibody on a support and sandwiching a lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein as a cancer marker with a labeled lectin WFA to carry out detection using the sandwich method. In the above sandwich method, as an alternative to solid-phasing the antibody on a support, the lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein can be presented on a reaction field where a plurality of lectins including the lectin WFA are solid-phased on a support to perform detection using a labeled product of the antibody.",

These methods are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and any of the methods may be selected. These methods may also be performed according to conventional procedures: the setting of actual reaction conditions and the like are within the routine skill of a person skilled in the art. Of these, particularly preferred is the use of lectin/antibody sandwich ELISA in which an antibody and a lectin are used as a protein-binding substance and a glycan-binding substance, respectively.",
                                "In the sandwich method, a protein-binding substance or a glycan-binding substance is bound to a solid phase. Hereinafter, the solid-phased binding substance is referred to as a \u201cscavenger\u201d, and the other substance is referred to as a \u201cdetector\u201d. Examples of the support (solid phase) on which a scavenger is solid-phased include a plate (e.g., a microwell plate), a microarray substrate (e.g., a slide glass for a microarray), a tube, beads (e.g., plastic beads, magnetic beads), a carrier for chromatography (e.g., Sepharose (trade name)), a membrane (e.g., a nitrocellulose membrane, PVDF membrane), and a gel (e.g., polyacrylamide gel). Among others, a plate, beads, and a membrane are preferably used; a plate is most preferably used because of its simplicity of handling. The scavenger may be solid-phased by any method provided that a sufficient binding strength is obtained; for example, it is solid-phased by covalent bonding, ionic bonding, or physical adsorption. Alternatively, a support on which a scavenger is solid-phased in advance may be used.",
                                "The detector may be indirectly or directly labeled with a labeling substance. Examples of the labeling substance include fluorescent substances (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, Cy3, and Cy5), radioactive substances (e.g., 13C, and 3H), and enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase or the like), and glucose oxidase, and \u03b2-galactosidase). The detector may also be biotin-labeled while (strept)avidin being labeled with the above labeling substance to utilize the binding of biotin and (strept)avidin.",
                                "When the enzyme is used as a labeling substance, the detection is carried out by using a suitable substrate depending on the enzyme used. For example, when peroxidase is used as an enzyme, o-phenylenediamine (OPD), tetramethyl benzidine (TMB), or the like is used as a substrate; when alkaline phosphatase is used, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), or the like is used. An enzyme reaction termination solution and a substrate-dissolving liquid which are heretofore known and properly selected depending on the enzyme selected may be used.",
                                "The scavenger forms a complex together with a WFA-binding marker glycoprotein in a body fluid sample. The signal produced by applying the detector to this complex is measured to detect and quantify the WFA-binding marker glycoprotein in a body fluid. The signal may be measured using a suitable measuring apparatus depending on the labeling substance used.",
                                "The binding of a glycan to a lectin is weak compared to that to an antibody; thus, generally, the binding constant of an antigen-antibody reaction is considered to be 106 to 109 M\u22121, while the binding constant between a glycan and a lectin is considered to be 104 to 107 M\u22121. When the lectin is used as the glycan-binding substance, the signal detection is preferably performed using an evanescent wave excited fluorescence detection method. The evanescent wave excited fluorescence detection method is a method utilizing the fact that the entrance of light into the edge (side) of a slide glass under such conditions as to produce total reflection causes the exudation of a very short-range light called evanescent wave (called near-field light) only in a near field on the order of several hundred nanometers distant from the interface, for example, between two phases with different refractive indexes such as between glass (solid phase) and water (liquid phase). This method is performed by causing an excitation light for a fluorescent substance to enter from the edge and excite only a fluorescent substance present in a near field for the observation of the fluorescence. The evanescent wave excited fluorescence detection method is described in Kuno et al., Nature Methods, 2: 851-856 (2005) and the like. For this detection, GlycoStation\u2122 Reader 1200 (MORITEX Corporation) or the like may be used.",
                                "A lectin is used as the sugar-binding substance. The \u201clectin\u201d is a generic term applied to a protein recognizing, and binding to, a specific glycan structure. Glycans are each generally formed by a plurality of types of sugars and have various and complex structures because the mode of the binding between the sugars is diverse. Many lectins derived from animals and plants are known. Examples thereof include galectins as an animal lectin family having affinity for galactose; C-type lectins as a calcium-dependent animal lectin family; annexin having certain affinity for glycosaminoglycan; leguminous lectin; and ricin. In the present invention, Wisteria-derived lectin WFA (Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin) is used.",
                                "The lectin may be properly selected depending on the glycan structure of a glycoprotein to be detected. Techniques for analyzing the glycan structure of a glycoprotein include glycan profiling by frontal affinity chromatography (FAC), a lectin microarray, or MS or MSn (mass spectrometry or tandem mass spectrometry). If the glycan structure of the glycoprotein is determined, a suitable lectin can be selected based on the information thereof. Information on lectins is available from Lectin frontier DataBase (LfDB) or the home page of Research Center for Medical Glycoscience, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.",

These peptides may each be any peptide provided that the prepared anti-WFA-binding marker glycoprotein antibody does not cross-react with an unrelated antigen contained in a sample, and may contain the substitution, addition, deletion, or the like of one to several amino acids. For example, the peptide may be a peptide adjacent to or distant from the glycan-bound amino acid residue of the WFA-binding marker glycoprotein.",

With regard to a phase in which the antibody recognizing and binding to a lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein can be utilized, the four molecules of MUC1, CA125, N-CAM-L1, and Maspin whose specific expression has been confirmed in cholangiocarcinoma by tissue staining are useful as tissue markers as well as serum and bile markers. Meanwhile, other antibodies not leading to cholangiocarcinoma-specific staining are probably useful as markers in the bile and serum by combination with WFA. From the results of tissue staining, the range of the antibody needs to be narrowed for adaptation to each diagnosis phase, and combination with WFA is important in the case of the bile and serum.",

Sugar chain structures carried by WFA-binding glycoprotein, are specific for cholangiocarcinoma. For the purpose of the present invention, the \u201clectin WFA (Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin)\u201d bound to the \u201clectin WFA (Wisteria floribunda Agglutinin)-binding glycoprotein\u201d as a cancer marker for specifically detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as a glycan biomarker refers to a lectin as an agglutinin derived from Wisteria floribunda. According to the present invention, the \u201clectin WFA\u201d is used as a fluorescence labeled form or the like. Alternatively, it is used to present, capture or enrich only a WFA-binding glycoprotein group from bile by immobilization on a substrate or a support such as agarose.",

The enriched protein can be identified by proteomics using mass spectrometry or the like.",
                        "The method for detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma according to the present invention can be performed by detecting the presence of the cancer marker in a test specimen by WFA staining using a labeled lectin WFA or by a sandwich method using a sandwich of the lectin WFA, the lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein as a cancer marker and the antibody recognizing, and binding to, a lectin WFA-binding glycoprotein. The image of detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma using the sandwich method of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1. In the figure, the image of detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma when an antibody-immobilized well plate is used to overlay a directly or indirectly fluorescence-labeled lectin to selectively detect a molecule bound to WFA among candidate molecules trapped by the antibody is shown in \u201ca\u201d in FIG. 1, and the image of detecting intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma when an WFA-immobilized well plate is used to overlay a directly or indirectly fluorescence-labeled antibody to selectively detect a candidate molecule trapped by WFA is shown in \u201cb\u201d in FIG. 1.",

As shown in Table 2 (the results of tissue staining), the expression of WFA ligand was observed in the cancerous ductal epithelium of 8 cases (32%) for normal biliary epithelium, 83 cases (88%) for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 8 cases (80%) for the cholangiocellular carcinoma part of mixed-type liver cancer.

The resultant sensitivity, i.e., the ability to detect cancer, is 83% (15/18) superior to 22% (4/18) for the bile biopsy. It is necessary that intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can be early detected with low false negativity, by its characteristics. That is, a high-sensitivity marker is important.
