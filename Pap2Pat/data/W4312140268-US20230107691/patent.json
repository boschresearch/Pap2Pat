    "date": "2022-10-05 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A closed loop system using in-ear infrasonic hemodynography and method therefor are disclosed. The system includes an in-ear biosensor system that detects biosignals including infrasonic signals of an individual, and sends the biosignals to an analysis system that identifies physiological data from the biosignals that is associated with the autonomic nervous system of the individual. External sensors can detect other physiological data of the individual during environmental conditions and under different stimuli, and send the other data and the context under which it was detected to the analysis system. The analysis system can train a machine learning model with the identified physiological data in conjunction with the other physiological data, execute actions in response to new information to adjust the autonomic nervous system of the individual, optimize their performance on tasks, and train the individual to adjust their autonomic nervous system in response to new stimuli.",

                        "Biometrics refers to processes and systems for obtaining and analyzing biological measurements and physical and behavioral characteristics of individuals. Biometrics systems obtain and analyze the biological measurements and characteristics, which are also known as biometric data.",
                        "Biometric data monitoring is crucial to understanding health and diseases. Interest in this area monitoring has grown recently, particularly due to the increasing cost of healthcare, prolonged life expectancy, recent pandemics, and advancements in wearable technology.",
                        "Physiological processes of individuals such as respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, muscle activity, sweat gland activity and internal movements of organs generate electric, thermal, chemical and acoustic energy. These generated energies are also known as biosignals. Biometrics systems can detect these biosignals using detector/transducer devices (\u201cdetector devices\u201d) of various technologies attached to different parts of the body, These devices include: wearable and wireless devices, smartphone-connected technologies, implantable sensors and various lab-on-a-chip nanosensor platforms, in examples.",
                        "The detector devices of the biometric systems detect the biosignals and generate signals representing aspects of the biosignals. The generated signals can be in the form of electric potential, pressure difference, mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves, in examples. The generated signals form sets of biosignal data. The biometric systems then analyze the biosignal data, and measure/quantify aspects of and changes to the data over time to obtain the biometric data. In the case of the aforementioned physiological processes, the biometric data obtained and measured are also known as cardiovascular measurements. For brevity, the generated signals that form the sets of biosignal data are hereinafter referred to simply as \u201cbiosignals.\u201d",
                        "Historically, cardiologists have used contemporary biometrics systems to obtain the cardiovascular measurements in both clinical settings and remote monitoring settings. The contemporary biometrics systems include catheter systems and electrocardiogram (ECG) systems, in examples. In particular, the ECG systems set a standard for measurement accuracy of cardiovascular measurements such as heart rate (HR), inter-beat interval (IBI), and heart rate variability (HRV). HR is a measure of average beats per minute, while HRV is typically expressed in milliseconds and measures the changes in time, or variability, between successive heartbeats/IBIs.",
                        "The contemporary biometrics systems have limitations. They require in-person visits to a clinic or hospital, are expensive and invasive. The catheter systems, in one example, require that a technician or other medical professional insert a catheter into the individual's artery. The ECG systems, in another example, require placement of multiple electrodes connected to wires upon the individual's skin at or near the heart and major arteries.",
                        "The autonomic nervous system is a control system of the body that acts largely unconsciously. The autonomic nervous system regulates many of the aforementioned physiological processes and other bodily functions such as digestion, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal.",
                        "The autonomic nervous system has two basic portions, a sympathetic nervous system and a parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system dominates during moments of stress, physical activity and when the individual is in danger. For these reasons, the sympathetic nervous system is often associated with a \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response. The parasympathetic nervous system, in contrast, dominates during periods of rest, during digestion and calmness. For these reasons, the sympathetic nervous system is often referred to as the\u201crest and digest\u201d portion of the autonomic nervous system.",
                        "Biofeedback is a mind-body technique that uses various detector devices to detect biosignals associated with physiological processes of individuals and to detect behaviors exhibited by the individuals in response to an event or stimuli. The technique then allows the individuals to create conscious control over their physiological processes and the behaviors based upon the detected information. The behaviors can include eye movements, changes to body position and posture, and tensing of muscles, in examples. The main goal of biofeedback is self-regulation of your physiological state.",
                        "Biofeedback systems collect the information detected during biofeedback over time, and can execute actions in response to the detected information. The actions can include: sending notifications or recommendations for the individuals to change their behavior; informing individuals about changes to their physiology to build self-awareness of their physiology, and to suggest actionable steps to change the physiology; presenting descriptions of the changes or plots of biosignals associated with the changes to a visual display or for audible playback; and making changes directly to the environment around or otherwise perceived by the individuals, in examples. By detecting changes in real-time, and either enabling the individual to make real-time adjustments to their physiological processes and behaviors or making changes directly to the environment perceived by the individuals, the biofeedback systems can provide individuals with a level of conscious control over their autonomic nervous system and body that they typically would otherwise not have.",
                        "A closed-loop system measures, monitors, and controls a process. One way in which a process can be accurately controlled is by monitoring its output and \u201cfeeding\u201d at least some of the output back as input to the same process. The new output that results from applying new input and the previous output as input to the process can be compared to a desired output, so as to reduce the error of the system. Additionally, if the output begins to diverge from the desired output, also known as creating a disturbance of the system, the input can be adjusted to bring the output of the system back to the original or desired response. The quantity of the output being measured is called the \u201cbiofeedback signal,\u201d and the type of control system which uses biofeedback signals to both control and adjust itself is called a closed-loop system."

                        "More recently, consumer wearable devices (\u201cwearables\u201d) have emerged as components of biometric systems. The biometric systems that utilize or include the wearables are also known as wearable systems. In the wearable systems, detector devices of the wearables generally send signals representing the aspects of the biometric data they detect to a mobile phone or other wireless device for local processing and analysis. The mobile phone or other wireless device then might send the analyzed information for storage to a remote database. In some wearable systems, the wearables send the detected information for later (in non real-time) analysis to a server in a remote network.",
                        "Existing wearables can detect at least some of the cardiovascular measurements using various detector devices of different technologies. These technologies include electric potentials (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), oscillometry, biochemical sensors, or a combination of these technologies . Because the wearables are typically worn on the person's wrist or finger and do not require an office visit to operate, the wearable systems are generally more accessible, convenient and less expensive than the contemporary biometric systems.",
                        "The technologies used in the detector devices of the existing wearable systems are constantly expanding, and the systems themselves are increasingly using advanced computational approaches to process the signals sent from the devices. As a result, wearable systems are challenging the contemporary biometric systems for their ability to obtain physiological measurements such as cardiovascular measurements, and are increasingly changing how at least some diseases are detected and monitored. This is because the detector devices of the wearables are able to detect and record representations of many different signals, including brain activity (EEG), blood pressure, respiration, and muscle biosignals (EMG), in examples.",
                        "However, the existing wearables and their wearable systems have limitations. Generally, the detector devices detect incomplete versions of the energy/phenomena generated by the individuals. This leads to errors when the processing systems of the wearable systems convert the signal representations of the detected information into the cardiovascular measurements. In many cases, the wearable systems are inaccurate with aggregated errors of up to 10 percent in reporting HR, in one example. Additionally, design constraints, including limitations in power consumption, memory usage, and data storage, impact the ability of the wearables to provide precise beat-to-beat assessment. For example, many wearables provide only time-averaged HR measurements over intervals of five (5) minutes or more. Still other existing wearables claim the ability to acquire or record HR data in real-time, such as continuously over time periods on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, but have no local processing ability. Instead, these wearable systems send the data to a remote server over a period of minutes or possibly hours, and the remote server then processes/analyzes the data.",
                        "Despite the ability of biometric systems including wearables to generate increasingly large quantities of electronic health data, health care continues to be reactive, treating a disease only after it is diagnosed. This approach narrows the capacity of health care professionals and policy makers to implement preventive measures and assumes that most if not all individuals mimic the common trends of disease trajectories and treatments.",
                        "These existing biometric systems including wearables have additional limitations. In one example, the wearables do not provide information regarding the individual in real-time (i.e., on the order of at least seconds, and preferably on the order of hundreds of milliseconds). Such real-time data is critical to characterizing and identifying changes to an individual's autonomic nervous system, which can change in response to stimuli on the order of seconds or even hundreds of milliseconds. In another example, the existing biometric systems do not create individualized baselines of autonomic nervous system behavior of individuals over time, such as days, weeks or even months. Such a corpus of information for each individual obtained over time is key to interpreting the physiological state of the individuals at a given time.",
                        "A novel closed loop system is proposed that overcomes the limitations of the existing biometrics systems that include wearables/wearable systems, while providing accuracy that rivals that of the contemporary biometric systems. The closed loop system uses data associated with physiological processes of individuals, and possibly data associated with behavioral characteristics of the individuals, in examples.",
                        "The closed loop system utilizes in-ear infrasonic hemodynography (IH) technology that combines the precision and full range biometric data access capabilities of the contemporary biometric systems, with the convenience and low cost of the wearable systems and their wearables. For this purpose, the closed loop system includes a familiar in-ear headphone system that has been adapted to passively detect biosignals. The biosignals are in the form of acoustic signals including infrasonic signals generated by blood flow and other vibrations related to body activity/physiological processes of the individual. The in-ear headphone system is also known as an in-ear biosensor system.",
                        "The in-ear biosensor system can detect and collect a continuous stream of biosignals and transmit the biosignals to a mobile device and online server systems in real time. A data analysis system of the closed loop system can then identify and extract physiological data of the individual from the biosignals, where the physiological data includes the various cardiovascular measurements of the individual, and other information identified within the biosignals. In examples, the data analysis system might be located in one or more of the following that are in communication with the in-ear biosensor system: a local area network, a mobile phone, and a remote network/cloud-based network.",
                        "By using online servers, the closed loop system is able to perform continuous, real-time data collection and analysis without the problems of battery usage, storage and complex computations related to big data. The closed loop system also allows for instantaneous/real-time analysis and quality assessment of the biosignals, thereby enabling true closed-loop biofeedback capabilities that are not provided by existing biometric systems including wearables and wearable systems.",
                        "Experimentation has shown high waveform fidelity for individuals using the closed loop system and its in-ear biosensor system. The closed loop system provides a 0.99 correlation in HR and IBI measurements as compared to the \u201cgold standard\u201d ECG systems. Thus, the proposed closed loop system is the first demonstration of IH capabilities that can deliver accuracy comparable to ECG systems, where the detector devices are in a wearable form factor.",
                        "The in-ear biosensor system has multiple design advantages such as familiar form factor, multipurpose use and low battery usage. The IH signals show high fidelity within subjects allowing for accurate measurements of body vitals when compared with standard methods of measurement. The continuous data stream from the IH earbuds provides detailed information on time scales as short as milliseconds, generating more than 2.8 MB of data per hour. The in-ear biosensor system allows for continuous monitoring without compromising data quality and sampling rate.",
                        "In general, according to one aspect, the invention features a closed loop system. The system includes an interface configured to receive biosignals including infrasonic signals from an in-ear biosensor system worn by an individual, and a data analysis system that monitors the received biosignals at the interface over time and identifies physiological data of the individual based upon the received biosignals.",
                        "The data analysis system creates a baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual over a time period from the identified physiological data, and the baseline autonomic nervous system profile tracks changes to a physiological state of the individual over the time period. The data analysis system also identifies current physiological data of the individual from new biosignals received at the interface over a current time period, and identifies a current physiological state of the individual by mapping the current identified physiological data against the baseline autonomic nervous system profile.",
                        "In examples, the physiological data includes a heart rate, a heart rate variability, a blood pressure measurement, a respiration rate, a stroke volume and a heart contractility of the individual. In one implementation, the data analysis system creates a baseline autonomic nervous system profile over a time period by plotting one or more types of the identified physiological data against one or more other types of the physiological data.",
                        "In another implementation, the data analysis system creates a baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual over a time period by passing the identified physiological data to a machine learning model for training, where the trained machine learning model incorporates the baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual. Thee data analysis system then maps the current identified physiological data against the baseline autonomic nervous system profile by passing the current identified physiological data as input to the trained machine learning model, the result of which is the current physiological state of the individual.",
                        "In yet another implementation, the data analysis system creates the baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual from the identified physiological data and from other physiological data received at the interface, where the other physiological data is detected by and sent from one or more external sensors monitoring the individual.",
                        "In still another implementation, the data analysis system creates the baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual from the identified physiological data and from user provided physiological data received at the interface.",
                        "Additionally and/or alternatively, the data analysis system might present the current physiological state of the individual and the baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual to the interface for access by one or more external systems.",
                        "In another example, when the data analysis system maps the current identified physiological data against the baseline autonomic nervous system profile, if the current identified physiological data deviates from that of the physiological data in the profile by a threshold amount, the data analysis system instructs the individual to perform one or more actions designed to adjust the current physiological state of the individual to be similar to that of the physiological state in the profile.",
                        "In yet another example, the data analysis system accesses a target physiological state at the interface that was sent to the interface by a system external to the closed loop system, where the closed loop system instructs the individual to perform one or more actions designed to adjust the current physiological state of the individual to be that of the target physiological state.",
                        "In general, according to another aspect, the invention features a method of operation for a closed loop system. The method comprises: receiving, at an interface, biosignals including infrasonic signals from an in-ear biosensor system worn by an individual; monitoring the received biosignals at the interface over time and identifying physiological data of the individual based upon the received biosignals; creating a baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual over a time period from the identified physiological data, the baseline autonomic nervous system profile tracking changes to a physiological state of the individual over the time period; and identifying current physiological data of the individual from new biosignals received at the interface over a current time period, and identifying a current physiological state of the individual by mapping the current identified physiological data against the baseline autonomic nervous system profile.",
                        "The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts, and other advantages, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims.

                        "The beat-to-beat variations in IBI are clearly visible in the tachograms for patterns or exercises that induce large variability, in particular, the resonant breathing exercises and the Valsalva maneuver. Overall, breathing affects HRV with IBI changing up to 300 ms for different breathing techniques. On the other hand, variability in IBI is muted for regular breathing. For all cases, the tachogram derived from IH captures IBI changes at short timescales.",
                        "FIG. 3A through 3C are power spectra plots for each of the tachograms in FIG. 2A through 2C, respectively. In each of FIG. 3A through 3C, the low-frequency band and the high frequency band are indicated via a legend. The frequency domain representation of the biosignals is indicated by reference 101\u2032. Each of the plots is in units of normalized power versus frequency in Hz.",
                        "The locations of spectral peaks from the tachograms in FIG. 3A-3C correspond to the respiratory rate expected from each breathing pattern. For example, fundamental breathing frequencies for a 4-second inhale and a 6-second exhale pattern (4:6 pattern) was 0.1 Hz indicating a breathing rate of 6 breaths per minute. The low-frequency (LF) band and the high-frequency (HF) band marked on the power spectra are defined as the integrated power within 0.04-0.15 Hz and 0.15-0.4 Hz respectively. Under controlled conditions, the integrated power in the LF and HF bands can be used to estimate the ratio between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity and can also distinguish controlled breathing from spontaneous breathing. Comparison between metrics calculated using IH signals/biosignals 101 and ECG signals 24 show that the in-ear biosensor system 102 is capable of continuously monitoring body vitals and providing accurate feedback. LH and HF, as well as their ratios can be used as additional input to characterize the state of the autonomic nervous system.",
                        "Existing wearables have many drawbacks that limit their use as reliable sources for health monitoring. In one example, consumer wearables have high aggregate errors (up to 10%) in calculating vital measurements due to discrepancy in sampling methods, proprietary algorithms used and quality of data. In another example, there are intrinsic differences between methods used by different wearables for calculating cardiac activity. For instance, PPG devices in smartwatches typically use the time differences between two peaks, known as the P-P intervals, recorded at a low sampling rate (50 Hz) to quantify HR. Errors in localizing peaks due to sampling inaccuracies alone can vary measurement P-P intervals by 50 ms. Additionally, many wearables monitor cardiac activity intermittently or report only processed biometrics that are often calculated from signal averages. By ignoring beat-to-beat variations, these algorithms fail to accurately identify rhythm disturbances such as atrial fibrillation that can be indicative of underlying cardiovascular conditions.",
                        "In contrast, the closed loop system 10, through use of its in-ear biosensor system 102, and auxiliary sensors in other embodiments, allows for a precise beat-to-beat cardiac assessment. The metrics presented here might also be combined with advanced processing techniques for early detection of cardiac dysfunction. Since the acoustic/vibration sensors of the in-ear biosensor system 102 can also capture infrasounds generated from multiple systems in the body, IH technology may further be expanded toward comprehensive monitoring of the cardiovascular system as well as other vital functions like respiratory system or brain activity. Additionally, methods of monitoring autonomic nervous system response through IBI and tachograms can be extended towards application in closed-loop biofeedback (e.g., sleep and stress monitoring).",
                        "The acoustic/vibration sensors used for IH are capable of capturing infrasonic signals that propagate to the ear canal from various sources within the human body. Here, though the scope of biosignal detection is limited to the observation of pressure waves propagating from the cardiovascular system and into the inner ear canal, these sensors can also pick up speech and bodily motion, even as small as ears twitching and eyes blinking. It is speculated, though, that future studies may reveal use cases for the speech and motion signals captured by the acoustic/vibration sensors, such as assessments of the pulmonary system and structural health of bones.",

Such a system enables studies of trends in existing and new measures for healthcare and other applications. In addition, the novel nature of the IH-based in-ear biosensor system 102 and technology requires flexibility in data management. Retaining access to the raw signal makes it possible to retroactively calculate any new clinically relevant measures that may emerge in future studies.",

Next, the data are stored and processed in real-time via the data analysis system 109. The cloud infrastructure 108 enables storage of raw data in large quantities beyond the memory capabilities of the user devices 107 and also allows the closed loop system 10 to scale as numbers of individuals/subscribers increases.",

Alternatively, as the heart rate 410-1 decreases, a shaded \u201cdown\u201d arrow is shown in the parasympathetic nervous system portion, indicating that a decrease in the heart rate 410-1 correspondingly tends to adjust the physiological state of the individual more towards the parasympathetic nervous system portion (i.e., the individual is more calm).",

In the case of advertisements, in particular, the loss of a few seconds can result in a missed opportunity to present the advertisement at the optimal time.",
                        "The closed loop system might also access one or more stored and anonymized baseline autonomic nervous system profiles of other individuals. The data analysis system determines whether the baseline autonomic nervous system profiles of the other individuals are similar to the baseline autonomic nervous system profile of the individual, and can use the similar baseline autonomic nervous system profiles to predict changes to the current physiological state of the individual.",
                        "Additionally or alternatively, the closed loop system has music applications. For this purpose, the system 10 might create song lists to either calm down or energize individuals 100 based on their response, profiles 502 and predictions from other individuals 100 with similar baseline autonomic nervous system profiles 502 or application-specific profiles. In another example, the closed loop system 10 has work space applications. For this purpose, the system 10 might help people to obtain focus and performance based on whether they need to stay calm or be more alert, in examples.",
                        "In yet another example, the closed loop system 10 has social media and dating applications. For this purpose, the system 10 might influence the selection and/or matching of individuals as potential dating partners, potential parties to add to their list of people with whom they communicate or share mutual interests based on their autonomic nervous system profiles 502, in examples.",
                        "The closed loop system 10 can also present the current physiological state of the individual 100 and the baseline autonomic nervous system profile 502 of the individual to the interface 134. In this way, one or more external systems such as social media platforms and gaming system platforms can access the current physiological state of the individual and the baseline autonomic nervous system profile 502, and tailor application-information information that is based upon the current physiological state of the individual 100 and the baseline autonomic nervous system profile 502.",
                        "In another example, the data analysis system 109 might accesses a target physiological state at the interface 134 that was sent to the interface by a system external to the closed loop system. The closed loop system might then instruct the individual 100 to perform one or more actions designed to adjust the current physiological state of the individual to be that of the target physiological state. For example, prior to the individual taking a stressful standardized exam, an app provided ahead of time by the test administrators that is executing on the user device 107-1 might send instructions to the interface 134 for the individual 100 to transition to a more calm physiological state. The data analysis system 109 might read the instructions, and either suggest that the individual 100 engage in calming behavior (e.g., deep breathing exercises), or could select a song, nature sounds such as running water for playback by a music app executing on the user device 107-1.",
