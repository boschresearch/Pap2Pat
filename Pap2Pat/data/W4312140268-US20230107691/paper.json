    "abstract": "Human bodily mechanisms and functions produce low-frequency vibrations. Our ability to perceive these vibrations is limited by our range of hearing. However, in-ear infrasonic hemodynography (IH) can measure low-frequency vibrations (<20 Hz) created by vital organs as an acoustic waveform. This is captured using a technology that can be embedded into wearable devices such as in-ear headphones. IH can acquire sound signals that travel within arteries, fluids, bones, and muscles in proximity to the ear canal, allowing for measurements of an individual\u2019s unique audiome. We describe the heart rate and heart rhythm results obtained in time-series analysis of the in-ear IH data taken simultaneously with ECG recordings in two dedicated clinical studies. We demonstrate a high correlation ( r = 0.99) between IH and ECG acquired interbeat interval and heart rate measurements and show that IH can continuously monitor physiological changes in heart rate induced by various breathing exercises. We also show that IH can differentiate between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm with performance similar to ECG. The results represent a demonstration of IH capabilities to deliver accurate heart rate and heart rhythm measurements comparable to ECG, in a wearable form factor. The development of IH shows promise for monitoring acoustic imprints of the human body that will enable new real-time applications in cardiovascular health that are continuous and noninvasive.",

                "Biometric monitoring is crucial to our understanding of health and disease. Despite our ability to generate increasingly large quantities of electronic health data, health care continues to be reactive, treating disease only after it is diagnosed. This approach narrows our capacity to implement preventative measures and assumes that every individual follows the common trajectories of disease and the course of treatments.",
                "Physiological processes such as respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, muscle activity, and internal movements of organs generate electric, thermal, chemical, and acoustic energy1. Biological signals representing aspects of these energies are transmitted as electric potential, pressure difference, mechanical vibrations, or acoustic waves, and can be measured using transducers and technologies attached to different parts of the body1\u20136. These digital health technologies (DHTs) include wearable and wireless devices7\u20139, smartphone-connected technologies10,11 implantable sensors12,13, and various lab-on-a-chip nanosensor platforms14,15. DHTs are constantly expanding and becoming increasingly sophisticated in their ability to quantify physiologic measurements through advanced computational approaches, thus challenging our contemporary methods for how physiologic parameters are measured, and ultimately how a disease is detected and monitored10,16.",
                "DHTs are able to record a variety of signals, including cardiac activity, blood pressure, respiration, brain activity (EEG), and muscle activity (EMG)9,11,17. Cardiovascular measurements can be extracted from wearable DHTs, such as activity monitors and smartwatches using various methods including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), oscillometry (pulse rate variation), biochemical sensors, or a combination of techniques18. These cardiac monitoring devices are commonly validated on standard physiologic measurements such as heart rate (HR), interbeat interval (IBI), and heart rate variability (HRV). While wearable devices are commercially available, most of them are not considered medical devices, as they are typically incomplete and inaccurate with an error rate of up to 10 percent in reporting HR alone12,19. Several other design constraints, including limitations in power consumption, memory, and data storage, impact the ability of consumer wearables for precise and continuous beat-to-beat measurements.",
                "Herein, we introduce a method of in-ear infrasonic hemodynography (IH) and a technology platform that uses sensors embedded in earbuds to monitor cardiovascular activity. The IH technology aims to provide continuous and accurate cardiac signal measurements and to bridge the gap between convenient wearables and precise medical devices. Within the present investigation, we compare the IH performance to the gold-standard ECG using data from two dedicated clinical studies, with study subjects in sinus rhythm (SR, n\u2009=\u200925) and atrial fibrillation (AF, n\u2009=\u200915). First, we evaluate the accuracy of IH in measuring IBI and HR by correlations to ECG in healthy SR subjects and explore if this accuracy is preserved in the presence of large IBI variations induced by various breathing exercises. A similar correlation analysis is performed in AF subjects, for whom large IBI variations occur naturally, characteristic of the disease. Finally, we assess the IH ability to differentiate between AF and SR, by comparing it to ECG in a machine-learning approach for rhythm classification. In this approach, we build and train a random forest classifier model using additional external ECG data from patients in SR and AF (PhysioNet database). Then, without further modifications, the trained model is applied to our joint SR and AF data, separately for ECG and IH, and the IH performance in AF detection is compared to the ECG performance."

                        "The in-ear headphone with embedded IH technology shares a similar architecture to many consumer wireless in-ear headphones and can be used to collect IH signals and simultaneously play audio. Each earbud has an integrated acoustic sensor that enables the measurement of small fluctuations in in-ear acoustic pressure. The turbulence associated with the heart sounds and vascular hemodynamics has specific infrasound features that are captured by the IH earbuds20. While IH signals are captured below the range of human hearing (<20\u2009Hz), audio output is conventionally restricted to within the range of human hearing (20\u2009Hz to 20\u2009kHz); thus, there is minimal interference in the IH signal when speaker audio is present. This phenomenon allows for new methods of physical acoustical tuning, which contribute to an earbud design that optimizes IH signal acquisition and at the same time preserves audio quality comparable to that of consumer-grade in-ear headphones.",
                        "A device layout and an image showing the in-ear headphone being worn are illustrated in Fig. 1a, b, respectively. The headphone consists of two earbuds and a controller that can communicate with mobile devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The earbuds and the controller are connected via a cable (Fig. 1a\u2013m). Each earbud contains the infrasonic sensor (Fig. 1a\u2013d) and the speaker (Fig. 1a\u2013f). The controller board (Fig. 1a\u2013j) is placed in a controller housing (Fig. 1a\u2013h), which in addition hosts the device battery (Fig. 1a\u2013i) The infrasonic sensors are passive sensors that do not use a transmitter to send a signal, thus, the additional electric power required to operate them is minimal.Fig. 1Infrasonic hemodynography earbud system.a Exploded schematic illustration of the IH earbuds, interconnect schemes, and enclosure architectures. b Person wearing the IH earbuds; the earbuds have passive sensors/microphones installed on the left and right side. c Illustrative example of IH signal collected alongside and synchronized with ECG. The person in the photograph wearing the earbuds consented to the taking and publication of the photograph.",
                        "In the original design, the continuous data stream acquired using IH headphones is received via BLE on a mobile device. The device formats raw data and sends it using a secured communication protocol (Message Queue Telemetry Transport, MQTT) to a cloud infrastructure, where the data can be stored and processed in large quantities beyond the device memory. Such a design allows for continuous signal collection and processing without compromising data quality and sampling rate. For clinical studies presented here, to simultaneously record the data from IH and ECG, the wireless mobile device was replaced by a laptop computer connected to the controller through a USB cable (Fig. 7). The computer subsequently sent the joint data to the cloud. Figure 1c shows the exemplary signal collected from the in-ear headphone with embedded IH technology alongside signal from ECG for reference. IH and ECG signals were synchronized at the hardware level such that both ECG and IH used a common system clock to sample signals simultaneously."

For each subject, the data corresponds to 20 cardiac cycles, identified using ECG R-peaks reconstructed with a standard peak detection algorithm. Normalized signal waveforms of 20 individual heart beats were superimposed and shown together with their average and standard deviation, separately for IH and ECG. The distributions were centered at the position of ECG peak and shown for a time interval corresponding to 250 ms before and 650 ms after the ECG peak, independent of subjects\u2019 heart rate. For a given study subject and a given channel (left or right), the variation between individual heart beats, expressed in terms of signal fidelity, ranged between 0.94 and 1.00, with a median of 0.97. The variation between left and right channels was larger (reflected by lower values of signal fidelity; between 0.88 and 0.99, with a median of 0.94), attributed to an expected difference in frequency response associated with the earbud placement in the ear canals. IH waveforms exhibit a prominent peak that is delayed with respect to the QRS complex of the ECG. The average delay between the ECG R-peak and the onset and the position of the IH peak was 84 and 158\u2009ms for the left channel and 83 and 158\u2009ms for the right-channel, respectively, showing good synchronization between the channels.Fig. 2Exemplary signals from in-ear IH headphones and synchronized Lead-II ECG representing one cardiac cycle.ECG (top, blue) and IH signals from the left (red, middle) and right (red, bottom) ears for nine healthy subjects in the SR sample shown for 20 heartbeats stacked together (dotted lines), along with their mean (solid line) and standard deviation (band).

The regular breathing (with and without music) and the resonant breathing (with a 4:4 second inhale-to-exhale ratio) were performed by one of the subjects from the SR sample over a minute-long time interval. Figure 4d\u2013f depicts examples of additional three breathing maneuvers that maximize IBI variations, namely, the resonant breathing with the 4:6 and 5:7 ratios, and the Valsalva maneuver. Low variability was present during regular breathing (Fig. 4a). The average HR measured from both IH and ECG was 84.7 bpm. The HRV was 22 ms from IH and 17 ms from ECG. Both HR and HRV were relatively constant during data collection. In contrast, during the resonant breathing, a change in IBI was 300\u2009ms with an average HR change of 7\u2009bpm, for all three inhale-to-exhale ratios (Fig. 4c\u2013e). For these highly periodic breathing patterns, the respiratory rate can be measured using power spectral density, as discussed in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. Finally, during the Valsalva maneuver, IBI decreased by over 300\u2009ms and rebounded by ~400\u2009ms at the end of the maneuver (Fig. 4f). The amplitude of the IH signal followed a similar pattern as the IBI, showing a monotonous drop followed by a sudden increase.Fig. 4Physiological changes during minute-long breathing exercises.Comparison between various metrics calculated from ECG and IH signals during a regular breathing, b regular breathing while listening to music, and resonant breathing with the c 4:4, d 4:6, e 5:7 inhale-to-exhale ratio, as well as f the Valsalva maneuver.

We explored IH capabilities for precise beat-to-beat assessment by comparing its performance to the gold-standard ECG using data collected in SR and AF subjects. The results of our investigation can be summarized as follows:Waveforms of consecutive heartbeats in SR exhibit high signal fidelity (0.94\u20131.00) and show a prominent peak whose onset and position are delayed with respect to the ECG QRS complex by approximately 80 and 160 ms, respectively;A direct comparison of IBI and HR values measured from simultaneous IH and ECG signals in SR subjects shows a high correlation (r\u2009=\u20090.989 and 0.994 for IBI and HR, respectively);Tachograms with time-dependent beat-to-beat variations in IBI measured with the IH data demonstrate a similar variability (300\u2013400 ms) among resonant breathing exercises and the Valsalva maneuver;IH demonstrates high correlation (0.99) with heart rate variation in AF and between simultaneous IH and ECG measurements;A random forest classifier trained to distinguish AF from SR using publicly available ECG data, shows high performance (Sensitivity, Specificity \u22650.99) when applied separately to the IH and ECG data of the same cardiac rhythms.",
                "IH waveforms correlate with the cardiac cycle with high signal fidelity. Small deviations from the unity in fidelity values are due to differences between consecutive beats, which may occur due to physiological changes, the sensitivity of acoustic sensors, or minor changes in the placement of earbuds during wear. Differences in waveforms between the left and right channels are attributed to differences in earbuds placement between the channels. Notable differences between the subjects are predominantly physiological.",
                "A comparison between IBI, HR, and HRV metrics calculated using IH and ECG signals during breathing exercises inducing physiological changes shows that in-ear headphones with embedded IH technology are capable of capturing IBI changes at short timescales making it possible to continuously monitor heart rate and heart rate variation. Our preliminary methods of monitoring autonomic nervous system response through IBI tachograms (breathing and Valsalva) can potentially be extended towards clinical applications where closed-loop biofeedback is measured and augmented, e.g., for sleep and stress monitoring.",
                "The present study of cardiac rhythms focused specifically on SR and AF provides a basis for IH earbuds and for longer-term arrhythmia monitoring. The high sensitivity to detect AF during short time segments is especially critical for identifying and characterizing paroxysmal AF that may be particularly relevant in asymptomatic AF and for AF screening21\u201326. Future studies are underway to validate these findings in larger datasets and to include a variety of cardiac arrhythmias (Supplementary Fig. 2). Given the ubiquity of the earbud form factor27, it carries additional advantages, such as extended wear time and comfort, suitable for day time and night time monitoring.",
                "A number of limitations need to be appreciated when interpreting our results on distinguishing AF from SR. First, given a small sample size, it is possible that our results may overestimate the accuracy of AF classification and the correlation statistics between IH and ECG. Second, only the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were evaluated. As the study sample increases in size and among cohorts with different prevalence of AF, correlation statistics such as positive and negative predictive values will be different. Third, the AF classification algorithm relies only on IBI and will not recognize AF if the cardiac rhythm appears regular despite other AF signatures, such as a missing P-wave. Fourth, the current study and the associated algorithms do not directly assess the ability of IH to detect other arrhythmias and successfully separate them from AF and SR, although other arrhythmias are present in the AF sample (Supplementary Fig. 2). The inclusion of other rhythms is expected to reduce the performance of the classification algorithm. A separate system will be required to apply IH for AF detection in the general population that can be trained and validated for the identification of other arrhythmias using the methods described here.",
                "Our future work will also focus on applying the IH technology to provide insights into associated hemodynamics not accessible with ECG. While the ECG signal provides information about the electrical activity of the heart that triggers the heart contraction, IH monitors mechano-acoustic signals originating from the heart contraction and relaxation such as aortic valve opening and closing or pressure pulse waves that travel along the vascular system into the ear canal. The IH waveform exhibits similarities to the aortic pressure waveform in cardiac catheterization, and could potentially be used, e.g., to measure systolic and diastolic time intervals of the heart cycle. By developing algorithms to detect these and related cardiac functions, the IH technology may be expanded toward comprehensive monitoring of the cardiovascular system and the early detection of cardiac dysfunction in a noninvasive and continuous way.",
                "The in-ear IH technology is based on passive detection of low-frequency acoustical biosignals associated with the vascular hemodynamics, amplified through a pressure increase in the sealed ear-canal cavity. Signals are detected by acoustic pressure sensors and propagated to the controller board for data acquisition. In this study, to simultaneously collect IH and ECG data, the controller PCBA was connected to the laptop computer through a cable. In the original design, the system uses BLE to communicate with the mobile device (primarily for an extended battery life even when data is being streamed continuously), which sends the data to the cloud infrastructure. Currently, the BLE-embedded version has cable connections between the electrical components of each earbud and the controller (Fig. 1a). In the future, for convenient wear and signal coverage increase, the IH technology will be implemented as truly wireless in-ear headphones. By using online servers in the cloud, the system is able to perform continuous, real-time data collections and analysis without the problems of battery usage, storage, and complex computations related to big data28. It also allows for instantaneous quality assessment, thereby enabling true closed-loop capabilities.",
                "The results presented in this work are based on the data collected using a prototype device, with cables connecting the earbuds to the controller board. Additional cables were used to connect the controller board to the ECG device and the data-acquisition computer. This configuration made the system sensitive to additional vibrations propagating to the earbuds through the cables. Additional non-stationary signals, typically induced by subjects\u2019 motion or environmental background, could have an amplitude significantly greater than cardiac signals or even saturate the system. The reported analysis aimed at demonstrating the potential of the IH technology and was based on periodic heart beats from subjects instructed to remain at rest. A complete analysis of motion signals (such as moving, walking, eating, etc.) is beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed separately with fully wireless earbuds, additionally equipped with motion sensors.",
                "The IH technology can be enabled in a wearable form factor in everyday earbuds, provided they ensure a proper occlusion. The technology uses microphones that are placed inside the earbud\u2019s front cavity, which is the industry\u2019s standard microphone placement, already present in earbuds with active noise cancellation (the feedback microphone). Moreover, the technology uses algorithms and data storage in the cloud, which saves the battery on the device with no compromise on accuracy. As a result, the system can collect the data for an extended period of time without any time gaps for power or memory preservation. The development of future technologies (e.g., 5G or quantum computing) and the reduction in costs will further propel the adoption of wearable devices by enabling faster data transfer rate, low end-to-end latency, reduced cost, increased computational power and improved device connectivity, opening path toward closed-loop applications and detecting diseases in presymptomatic people29,30."

Acoustical biosignals from IH represent the fluctuating pressure changes inside the ear of an individual with respect to a reference pressure (e.g., ambient pressure). These biosignals typically contain sounds in the infrasonic range (0\u201320\u2009Hz), which are sounds with frequencies below the audible range (20\u201320\u2009kHz). Thus, infrasonic biosignals can be identified as acoustic signals with components in the \u201clow-frequency\u201d spectrum (i.e., from 0 to 20\u2009Hz).",

Sound waves with an input acoustic volume velocity Ua interact with the acoustic impedance Za of the cavity. The product of these two variables is P\u0394, the dynamic acoustic pressure of sound observed in the cavity.

                        "In the case of IH, both the biosignals generated by the human body and the audio emitted from the speaker of the earbud are observed as acoustic pressure changes in the ear canal. The occluded human ear canal has an average volume on the order of 2 cubic centimeters (cc). The smallest wavelength of sound within the infrasonic range (\u226420\u2009Hz) is 17.15 meters; therefore, the occluded ear canal is a suitable acoustic cavity for application of Equations (1) and (2) to the acoustic pressure of biosignals in the ear canal.",
                        "Looking out of an open ear canal, which has a practically infinite volume, Za is negligible, and the acoustic pressure inside the ear canal becomes the atmospheric pressure. When an earbud is placed in such a way that the ear tip creates an airtight seal with the ear canal, thus creating a closed volume (Fig. 6), the acoustic impedance rises, and sound pressure fluctuations inside the ear canal are amplified, particularly within the infrasonic range.Fig. 6Placement of the earbud in the ear canal.The IH earbud (a), fitted into the ear canal (b). The earbud has capabilities to emit audio (c) and detect biosignals (d) within the infrasonic range. The seal (e) between the ear tip (f) and the ear canal wall plays a key role in the earbud\u2019s capability of detecting biosignals.",

Occluding the ear canal significantly decreases its volume and accounts for a correspondingly large increase in dynamic acoustic pressure. For instance, shrinking the effective acoustic volume of the ear canal from 200\u2009cc to 2\u2009cc amplifies the acoustic pressure of biosignals by up to 40\u2009dB. If the earbud can be fit in such a way that the effective acoustic volume of the ear canal shrinks by half, then the acoustic pressure magnitude of biosignals will subsequently increase by up to 6\u2009dB. Such a significant boost to the amplitude of the acoustic signal brings human biosignals into measurable range with commercially available microphones. The seal also blocks external environmental noise, further improving biosignal detection."

The pipeline performs on a live stream of data and results are delivered in a few seconds after data collection.Level 1: Raw data is collected from right and left earbuds. At this stage, the data may contain signals or artifacts caused by head movements, steps, music, etc., not originating from the cardiovascular system. Figure 8a shows an example of a biosignal obtained while listening to loud music (maximum volume) with strong bass.Level 2: Calibration occurs with corrections made for audio playing through the earbud and filtering of audible frequency range from speakers. Figure 8b illustrates that even in extreme cases music can be successfully filtered out from biosignals.Level 3: The data quality assessment is performed. Raw signals of a duration of one second are classified as either good-quality cardiac signals or loud signals generated by user motion using a proprietary neural network-based algorithm. The algorithm is based on a multi-layer perceptron classifier, which uses >20 features extracted from the signal in the time domain as an input. These features include statistical variables, such as a mean value and the variance of the signal strength, quantiles and the skewness and the signal distribution, etc., as well as morphological features, such as a signal shape, the signal peak width, and height, etc. The classifier was trained based on a machine-learning approach using manually classified data from about 70 subjects collected in a dedicated study, supported by simultaneous ECG signals. In total, >10,000 cardiac cycles were included in the model training, with ~50% of good-quality signals and 50% of signals with motion artifacts. For further analysis, only good-quality cardiac signals are selected, based on the value of a classifier output probability for a given signal window. An example of a low-quality signal due to motion artifacts rejected by this system is shown as a shaded area in Fig. 8c.Level 4: Events related to the cardiac cycle are extracted. Peaks in the biosignal waveforms are detected using an adaptive threshold method. Additional features are identified from the waveforms, including features that may correspond to cardiac events, such as aortic valve opening and closing (Fig. 8d).Level 5: Values of vital signs are calculated using features identified in Level 4. IBIs are obtained by measuring time intervals between consecutive peaks (Fig. 8e, bottom). Information from both earbuds is merged for improved reliability, favoring the channel with a higher score in the data assessment from Level 3. The joint signal is the basis for obtaining HR and HRV for a specific time window.

The dataset was complemented by the subjects from the SR Study (n\u2009=\u200925). As our signal processing pipeline described above was optimized for regular sinus rhythm, a dedicated AF sample selection was performed using the following criteria. For both IH and ECG data, quality assessment rules were applied to exclude data containing artifacts due to motion or from an improper fit of the earbuds. The data quality assessment was further visually verified and adjusted by members of the analysis team. An automated peak detection algorithm was applied to the IH and ECG data, and IBI were calculated between successive peak positions. In order to exclude rare heartbeats for which there was a clear electrical signal but limited blood flow and, hence, limited IH signal, an outlier rejection was performed on the resulting IBI, excluding IBIs falling four standard deviations away from the mean (\u2223IBIIH\u2009\u2212\u2009IBIECG\u2223\u2009<\u2009100\u2009ms) or outside of the 300\u20132500\u2009ms range.
