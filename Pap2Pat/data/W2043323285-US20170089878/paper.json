    "date": "2014-11-01",
    "abstract": "Acceleration in development of additional conventional hydropower requires tools and methods to perform laboratory and in-field validation of turbine performance and fish passage claims. The new-generation Sensor Fish has been developed with more capabilities to accommodate a wider range of users over a broader range of turbine designs and operating environments. It provides in situ measurements of three-dimensional (3D) linear accelerations, 3D rotational velocities, 3D orientation, pressure, and temperature at a sampling frequency of 2048 Hz. It also has an automatic floatation system and built-in radio-frequency transmitter for recovery. The relative errors of the pressure, acceleration, and rotational velocity were within \u00b12%, \u00b15%, and \u00b15%, respectively. The accuracy of orientation was within \u00b14\u00b0 and accuracy of temperature was \u00b12 \u00b0C. The new-generation Sensor Fish is becoming a major technology and being deployed for evaluating the conditions for fish passage of turbines or other hydraulic structures in both the United States and several other countries.",

                "Fish passing through hydroturbines or other hydraulic structures may be injured or killed when they are exposed to severe hydraulic conditions. 2,4,11 Injury mechanisms could include rapid and extreme pressure changes, 1,16 shear stress and turbulence, 5 strike by runner blades, 6 and cavitation. 8 In addition, in the Columbia and Snake River hydropower systems and elsewhere, turbines are nearing the end of their operational life expectancies. Before rehabilitating or replacing these turbines, new designs for runners and other portions of the turbine system are being considered. As part of this effort, in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere, improved survival rates and reduced injury rates for fish passing through turbines are being sought through changes in turbine design and operation.",
                "To design or operate hydroelectric facilities for maximum power generation and minimum ecological impact, it is critical to understand the nature of the hydraulic conditions or physical stresses to which fish are exposed when they pass through complex hydraulic environments and to identify the locations within turbines and operations where conditions are severe enough to injure or kill fish. While field studies using live fish 9,10 are necessary for the evaluation of turbine biological performance, they are limited in that they cannot determine the specific hydraulic conditions or physical stresses experienced by the fish, the locations where deleterious conditions occur, or the specific causes of the biological response. To overcome this deficiency, an autonomous sensor device (the Gen 1 Sensor Fish) was developed that could be released independently or concurrently with live fish directly into operating turbines as a means of measuring hydraulic conditions such as pressure, acceleration, and rotation acting on a body in situ during downstream passage. 3,6 It was originally designed specifically for the large Kaplan turbines in the Columbia River basin. The Gen 1 Sensor Fish was a key tool employed by the North Pacific Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who collaborated with the U.S. Department of Energy for its development, for virtually all of their post-construction structural and operations fish passage evaluations at mainstem Columbia River dams. 7 Correlation metrics between the Gen 1 Sensor Fish measurements and live fish injuries were also developed by conducting concurrent releases in turbulent shear flows under controlled laboratory conditions. 12 However, the size, aspects of function, deployment and recovery requirements, availability, and cost of the original design have limited its use beyond the main-stem Columbia River.",
                "To better support hydropower development nationally and internationally, it was necessary to develop a newgeneration Sensor Fish device (Gen 2 Sensor Fish). Two research areas where the Gen 2 Sensor Fish has been proposed for international use are high-head dams with Francis turbines and pump storage facilities. Some high-head dams and pump storage facilities 13,14 have depths and pressures that would exceed the pressure measurement range of the Gen 1 Sensor Fish. In addition, many Francis turbines have higher fish mortalities than Kaplan turbines 15 due to increased incidents of blade strike, so the evaluation of Francis turbines requires improved robustness of the Sensor Fish to avoid excessive damages. Overall, identified areas for improvement included: conditions as well as interaction with turbine water passage structures and moving mechanical components; (5) more robustness under extreme conditions; (6) increased data acquisition, storage capacity, and communication data rate; and (7) improved software for analysis and visualization of data. In addition to the improvements listed the estimated cost was also reduced by approximately 80%. After it was designed and built, the Gen 2 Sensor Fish was then evaluated systematically in both a controlled laboratory environment and field conditions."

                "The Gen 2 Sensor Fish (Figure 1) is 24.5 mm in diameter and 89.9 mm long, weighs approximately 42.1 g, and is neutrally buoyant in fresh water at deployment, with size and density similar to those of a yearling salmon smolt. It contains three-dimensional (3D) rotation sensors (i.e., 3axis gyroscope), 3D linear acceleration sensors (i.e., 3-axis accelerometers), a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, a 3D orientation sensor (i.e., 3-axis magnetometer), a radiofrequency (RF) transmitter, a recovery module, and a communication module. A low-power microcontroller collects data from the sensors and stores up to 5 min of data on an internal non-volatile flash memory at a sampling frequency of 2048 Hz. A rechargeable battery supplies power to the Gen 2 Sensor Fish. The recovery module makes the Gen 2 Sensor Fish positively buoyant and float to the surface for recovery after a pre-programmed time. The components were placed so that the center of gravity is very close to the geometric center. Overall, the design of the Gen 2 Sensor Fish features several improvements over the Gen 1 Sensor Fish (Table I). "

The accuracy of orientation was determined to be within \u00b14 \u2022 and accuracy of temperature was \u00b12 \u2022 C. In addition, the performance of the Gen 2 Sensor Fish, which included the recovery module, was validated in field conditions. It is being deployed to evaluate the conditions for fish passage of turbines or other hydraulic structures in several countries."
