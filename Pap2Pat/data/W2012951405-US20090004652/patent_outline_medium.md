# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce genetic basis of disease
- describe high-throughput genotyping methods

## SUMMARY

- introduce methods for identifying biological samples
- describe statistical analysis of genetic data
- identify small set of SNPs for sample identification
- describe cost-effectiveness of method
- introduce concept of genetic barcode
- describe comparison of test barcode to reference barcodes
- introduce method for identifying at least one SNP
- describe obtaining population of genetic samples
- separate population into subpopulations
- analyze genotype at each SNP
- rank SNPs by ratio of genotypes
- analyze second subpopulation
- score SNPs by ratio of genotypes
- designate candidate SNPs
- repeat steps to generate multiple candidate SNPs
- identify SNPs useful for analyzing genetic samples
- describe use of identified SNPs for sample analysis
- introduce method for identifying panel of SNPs
- exclude certain SNPs from panel
- identify remaining SNPs as panel
- describe method for analyzing genetic sample
- compare genotype of test sample to reference samples

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- determine minimum SNPs needed
- select desirable SNPs
- evaluate distance between samples

### Therefore: Î½NSNPs<=NSNPs.

- define distance measure
- introduce weights for different type of mismatches
- illustrate distance measure with example
- describe implemented distance function
- derive expected distance D of two random samples
- calculate match probability P_pm and mismatch probability P_mm
- identify similar cell lines using similarity analysis
- exclude cell lines with distance D less than 0.2
- select subset of SNPs for further analysis
- divide dataset into training and test sets
- apply selection criteria to training set
- analyze stability of selection criteria
- determine cutoff for distance measure
- estimate mismatch probability of true paired samples
- evaluate probability of getting same distance for two true paired samples
- describe analysis of samples
- discuss genotyping methods
- outline implementation of methods in hardware or software
