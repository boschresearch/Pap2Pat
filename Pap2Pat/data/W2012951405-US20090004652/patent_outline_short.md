# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce genetic analysis and its importance

## SUMMARY

- introduce methods for identifying biological samples
- describe statistical analysis of genetic data
- explain selection of SNPs for identification
- describe use of SNP panels for identification
- introduce concept of genetic barcode
- describe comparison of test and reference barcodes
- explain use of methods for various applications
- describe identification of SNPs useful for analysis
- introduce methods for analyzing genetic samples
- describe determination of genetic relationship
- summarize advantages of the methods

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- determine minimum number of SNPs needed

### Therefore: Î½NSNPs<=NSNPs.

- define distance measure
- motivate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
- apply distance measure to cell lines
- select SNPs for further analysis
- analyze stability of selection criteria
- determine cut-off for distance measure
- apply test to paired samples
- describe analysis of samples
- implement methods in hardware or software

### Other Embodiments

- disclaim limitation
