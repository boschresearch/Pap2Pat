                        "Because cancer and many other diseases have a genetic basis, and because a patient's response to a particular drug or treatment can be influenced by the patient's genetic makeup, researchers have undertaken the task of genetically characterizing patient tissue samples (including tumor samples), cell lines, and xenografts.",
                        "A population of organisms will contain several variants (alleles) of a given gene. Alleles can differ from one another at single basepair. These single basepair differences are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and several can be present in a single gene. High-throughput genotyping methods using high-density nucleic acid arrays and other methods can accurately genotype (i.e., determine the nucleotide(s) present) hundreds or thousands of SNPs in a genetic sample in parallel to provide an unequivocal molecular fingerprint of the genetic sample. The somatic cells of diploid organisms have two copies of each autosomal gene and many high throughput genotyping techniques are be sensitive enough to analyze a SNP to determine if an individual is homozygous for a first allele, homozygous for a second allele, or heterozygous (i.e., possesses one copy of each allele). The results of this analysis can be used for research and for making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.",
                        "The value of genetic analysis for research, diagnosis and treatment depends on the accuracy of the analysis. For example, potential therapeutic agents for treatment of cancer are sometimes identified by screening in cancer cells lines. Thus, it is crucial that the cell lines used in such analysis are properly identified. In addition, normal and tumor samples taken from cancer patient are used in staging, diagnoses, selecting treatments and monitoring the effect of treatments. Thus, the accurate identification of samples is extremely important because mis-identification can lead to an incorrect diagnosis or selection of a sub-optimal therapy.",
                        "Methods are available for genotyping hundreds or thousands of SNPs in parallel, and these methods can be used for proper identification of samples. However, particularly where a large number of samples must be analyzed, the genotyping of hundred or thousands of SNPs and the analysis of the resulting data can prove to be time-consuming and complex. Thus, it would be desirable to identify a manageable number of SNPs that, taken together, have the power to discriminate among and identify genetic samples."

                        "Described herein are methods and tools for accurately identifying and/or distinguishing biological samples containing genetic material, e.g., cell lines, tissue samples, blood samples, and the like. The methods are based, at least in part, on statistical analysis of genetic data, e.g., SNP genotype calls. When applied to particular sample datasets, e.g., a particular group of genetic samples, the methods described herein permit the identification of a relatively small set of SNPs that can be used as a powerful tool for identifying and/or distinguishing samples containing genetic material. The methods described herein permit the identification of sets of SNPs that are far more useful for distinguishing biological samples than much larger sets of randomly selected SNPs that are commonly used for genetic analysis. Because the number of SNPs required for genetic analysis is relatively small when using SNPs selected as described herein, the genetic analysis is very cost effective, particularly when compared to analysis that uses many hundreds or thousands of randomly selected SNPs, most of which are essentially useless for identification and discrimination of samples.",
                        "The methods described herein for selecting SNPs are particularly powerful because they can be used to select a set (panel) of SNPs that are tailored to the type of samples being analyzed. In many cases the actual SNPs selected will depend on the samples one wishes to analyze (e.g., whether the samples are from normal tissue or tumor tissue, the characteristics of the population of individuals from which the samples are obtained). For example, the methods described herein can be used to identify a set of SNPs that are useful for discriminating among the various cell types in the NCI60 cell lines. The methods described herein can also be used to identify a set of SNPs that are useful for discriminating among many thousands of cancer tumor samples. It is possible that the sets of SNPs selected in these two cases will not completely overlap. Indeed, there might be little overlap. In the methods described herein, actual analysis of the samples to be analyzed (or a subset of the actual samples to be analyzed) is used to determine which SNPs should be used for discrimination and identification of samples. This is as opposed to many other techniques, which rely on a priori selection methods.",
                        "Because the number of SNPs used in a SNP panel identified as described herein is relatively small, analysis of a genetic sample at each of the SNPs in a panel produces a result that can be thought of as a genetic barcode that identifies the biological sample. The barcode itself is series of genotypes at the SNPs in the panel, e.g., homozygous T at SNP 1, homozygous G at SNP 2, heterozygous A/T at SNP 3, etc. This genetic bar code can be compared to other genetic barcodes stored in a database. Each stored (or reference) genetic barcode is generated by analysis of an associated genetic sample. The genetic barcode (SNP genotype pattern) generated from a test genetic sample can be compared to the reference barcodes in order to identify a reference genetic barcode that exactly matches (or nearly matches) the test barcode. The test sample is very likely to be identical to (or genetically very closely related to) the genetic sample associated with matching barcode. Of course, the degree of confidence in the determination can depend on the SNPs analyzed and the number of SNPs analyzed. For SNPs of equal ability to discriminate among genetic samples, the larger number of SNPs analyzed, the great the confidence that a perfect match between two SNP panels means that the associated genetic samples are identical.",
                        "As noted above, the precise SNP panel used can vary from one application to another. Moreover, the number of SNPs in the panel can vary depending one the degree of confidence needed in the sample identification. For example, a first panel could be used to distinguish among NCI60 cell lines with a given degree of confidence. A second, larger panel could be used to distinguish among NCI60 cell lines with a far higher degree of confidence. The second panel could contain all of the SNPs in the first panel as well as additional SNPs. A different panel might be used to distinguish among samples in a collection of patient tissue samples, e.g., a collection of patient tissue samples used in a particular drug screening program.",
                        "Once a SNP panel has been identified, for example by analyzing a subset of a collection of biological samples, test biological samples can be analyzed to determine the genotype present at each SNP using techniques that are standard in the art. The vast majority of SNPs have two possible alleles and such SNPs are useful in the methods described herein. Thus, genetic material (DNA or cDNA) is obtained from a test biological sample and each selected SNP (i.e., each SNP in the panel) is analyzed to determine whether the test biological sample is homozygous for the first of the two possible alleles, homozygous for the second of the two possible alleles or heterozygous for the two possible alleles. In some cases, the analysis will not even require physically determining the genotype present at certain SNPs since the test biological sample will have been previously analyzed at some or all of the SNPs in the panel. Thus, the techniques described herein can be used to reanalyze samples that have already been genotyped at thousands of SNPs. In this reanalysis, only a subset of the informative SNPs, i.e., those identified by the techniques described herein are considered.",
                        "Described herein are methods for identifying at least one SNP useful for analyzing a genetic sample. The methods include:\n\n\n- - (a) obtaining a population of selected genetic samples;\n  - (b) separating, e.g., randomly dividing, the population of genetic\n    samples into a first subpopulation of genetic samples including a\n    portion of the genetic samples and a second subpopulation including\n    the remaining genetic samples;\n  - (c) analyzing the genotype at each SNP of a plurality of SNPs for\n    each genetic sample in the first subpopulation of genetic samples to\n    determine for each SNP:\n    - i) N_(aa), the number of genetic samples in which the SNP is\n      homozygous for a first allele,\n    - ii) N_(bb), the number of genetic samples in which the SNP is\n      homozygous for a second allele, and\n    - iii) N_(ab), the number of genetic samples in which the SNP is\n      heterozygous for a first and a second allele;\n  - (d) for the genetic samples in the first subpopulation, ranking each\n    SNP of the plurality of SNPs by how nearly the ratio\n    N_(aa):N_(bb):N_(ab) matches the ratio 1:1:2 to provide a ranking of\n    SNPs;\n  - (e) analyzing the genotype at each SNP in the plurality of SNPs for\n    each genetic sample in the second subpopulation of genetic samples\n    to determine for each SNP:\n  - i) N\u2032_(aa), the number of genetic samples in which the SNP is\n    homozygous for a first allele,\n  - ii) N\u2032_(bb), the number of genetic samples in which the SNP is\n    homozygous for a second allele, and\n    - iii) N\u2032_(ab), the number of genetic samples in which the SNP is\n      heterozygous for a first and a second allele;\n  - (f) for the genetic samples in the second subpopulation, determining\n    how closely the ratio N\u2032_(aa):N\u2032_(bb):N\u2032_(ab) matches the ratio\n    1:1:2 to provide a score for each SNP;\n  - (g) designating a SNP that both ranks above a pre-determined cut-off\n    in the ranking when analyzed in the first subpopulation and has a\n    score above a pre-determined score when analyzed in the second\n    subpopulation as a candidate SNP;\n  - (h) repeating steps (b)-(g) at least two times, each time\n    designating one or more SNPs as a candidate SNP to generate at least\n    two groups of candidate SNPs; and\n  - (i) identifying a SNP designated as a candidate SNP at least two\n    times as a SNP useful for analyzing a genetic sample.",
                        "As noted above, the SNPs identified as useful for analyzing a genetic sample are particularly useful for analyzing a genetic sample that is (or is suspected of being) from the same biological source as a genetic sample in the population of selected genetic samples. Thus, the identified SNPs are particularly useful for determining whether a test genetic sample is from the same biological source as a genetic sample that is a member of the population of selected genetic samples. For example, the population of selected genetic samples can all be contributed by cancer patients at a particular institution. This population of genetic samples can be used to identify a group of SNPs, i.e., a SNP panel. The SNPs in this SNP panel will be particularly useful for determining whether a test genetic sample is from a patient that contributed to the population of genetic samples. In some cases, the identified SNPs can be used to analyze genetic samples that are not the same as or closely related to a genetic sample that is a member of the population of selected genetic samples.",
                        "Various statistical methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used to score SNPs by how nearly the ratio Naa:Nbb:Nab matches the ratio 1:1:2. In addition, various statistical methods can be used to score SNPs by how nearly the ratio Naa:Nbb:Nab matches the ratio 1:1:2 to provide a ranking of SNPs. In both cases, the goal is to select those SNPs where the ratio Naa:Nbb:Nab is extremely close to or exactly 1:1:2. For example, the ratio can differ by less than 5%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.01% or 0.001%.",
                        "In various embodiments of these methods, steps (b)-(g) can be repeated at least 5 or 10 or more times and wherein a SNP designated as a candidate SNP at least 10 times is identified as a SNP useful for analyzing a genetic sample. Of course, the steps can be repeated fewer or more times (e.g., 5, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 or more times), and a SNP designated as a candidate SNP fewer or more than 10 times (e.g., 5, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 or more times) is identified as a SNP useful for analyzing genetic samples. Generally, the number of times that the steps are repeated dictates how often a SNP must be designated as a candidate SNP. Thus, if the steps are repeated 1,000 times, SNPs designated as candidates 400, 500, 600, 800, or more times are identified as being useful. Generally, it will be desirable to use SNPs that are designated in at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 90%, or even 100% of the repetitions of the selection. A group of identified SNPs forms a potential SNP panel. Some or all of the SNPs in such a panel can be used together to analyze genetic samples.",
                        "The methods described herein can be used to identify multiple useful SNPs, e.g., at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 useful SNPs. In general, when there are multiple rounds of steps (b)-(g), the SNPs designated most frequently are often the most useful for analyzing a genetic sample. Of course, this is not always the case. Some frequently designated SNPs are less useful for a variety of reasons. For example, a frequently designated SNP can be difficult or impractical to genotype. Thus, a SNP panel can exclude certain frequently designated SNPs.",

Put simply, the methods and tools described herein can be used in any situation where it is necessary to identity a genetic sample. Thus, the methods described herein can be used to determine whether two test biological samples are the same or different.

                        "As explained in greater detail below, the analytical methods described herein were first applied to the analysis of NCI60 Cell Lines. These cell lines are very commonly used in cancer research. For example, The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of microarray expression data for NCI60 Cell Lines as well a database containing information on toxicity of approximately 70,000 compounds for cells of NCI60 cell lines. The analysis described below provides a means for identifying a relatively small number of SNPs that can be used to differentiate and identify cells of the NCI60 cell lines. This analysis revealed that MDA-MB435, which is identified as a breast cancer cell line is genotypically identical to the M14 melanoma cell line. In addition, at least two breast cancer cell lines among the NCI 60 Cell Lines exhibit genetic identity with the MCF-7 cell line. Such mis-identification, inadvertent cross-contamination or errors in sample identification can have a profoundly adverse effect on experimental results and their interpretation. For example, a search of the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database identified more that 400 publications that erroneously identify MDA-MB435 as a breast cancer cell line.",

This, of course, depends on the number of samples one wishes to distinguish. Most SNPs have two possible alleles (i.e., one of two possible nucleotides are present at the polymorphic position). Thus, there are three possible states (allele calls) for each SNP. If one of the two possible nucleotides at a given SNP is referred to as \u201cA\u201d and the other is referred to as \u201cB,\u201d then there are three possible allele calls: AA, BB and AB. For simplicity in the formulas below, these genotypes are referred to as A, B and AB.",

This criteria optimizes the probability of having different calls.

That is useful in evaluating the probabilities. After many runs, the mean number of successes kmean is kmean=Np and Sd_kmean=sqrt(Np(1-p)). For a normal distribution, the probability that a measurement falls within n standard deviations of the mean (i.e., within the interval [kmean\u2212n sd, kmean+n sd]) is given by the integral of the distribution function. Given two samples, the probability of matched (P_pm) and of mismatched (P_mm) calls at each SNP locus is known (or can be evaluated from data).

Thus, the joint probability here is the sum, P_pm, of the homozygous joint probabilities (i.e., P(A,A) and P(B,B)) and of the heterozygous joint probability: P_pm=P(A,A)+P(B,B)+P(AB,AB).",

The technique is described in Genome Res 11:1913 (2001) and Human Muta 19:402 (2002). While standard GeneChip\u00ae arrays are useful for analyzing many SNPs, custom arrays can be designed to analyzed any SNP or group of SNPs.

                                "U.S. Pat. No. 6,709,816 (Affymetrix, Inc.) describes a high-throughput method for analyzing SNPs to determine if the sample is homozygous for a first allele, homozygous for a second allele or heterozygous at a give SNP. As explained in U.S. Pat. No. 6,709,816, SNPs can be accurately analyzed specificity by hybridizing uniquely tagged allele-specific nucleic acid sequences to corresponding tag probes in an array. Briefly, a nucleic acid sample is amplified using an allele-specific amplification such that uniquely tagged nucleic acids corresponding to different alleles of a polymorphic locus are generated. Nucleic acids corresponding to different alleles are linked to different tags. Each tag includes a sequence that is identical to all or part of a probe on a detection array. The method includes four steps: allele-specific amplification, labeling, hybridization, and detection. The allele-specific amplification employs allele- specific primers, each of which has an allele-specific 3\u2032 portion and a 5\u2032 portion that acts as a tag. The amplification products for each allele are labeled and hybridized to a solid support bearing appropriate probes in an array. Each probe in the array comprises the same or nearly the same sequence as the tag of an allele-specific primer.",
                                "The sequence tag is identical or nearly identical to the sequence of all or a portion of a respective probe in an array so as to allow specific binding between the complement of the tag and the probe. The sequence tags are selected so that they have similar hybridization characteristics and minimal cross-hybridization to other sequence tags.",
                                "Each pair of primers is designed to specifically amplify one allelic form of a polymorphic locus. The two primers in a pair of primers are complementary to opposite stands of the DNA region to be amplified. The first primer of the pair has a 3\u2032 nucleotide which is complementary to a specific allelic form of the SNP but not complementary to other allelic form (or forms). The first primer includes a portion at its 3\u2032 end which is complementary to the region of double stranded DNA to be amplified. The first primer also includes a portion at its 5\u2032 end which is a tag. The tag has the same sequence as all or a portion of a probe on a solid support. The tag sequence is not complementary to any significant portion of the DNA being amplified. The second primer can include a tag or not. The two primers hybridize to a double stranded nucleic acid at position that are less than 1,000 (100 or even 10) bases apart. The amplification generates a first amplified strand and a second amplified strand. The first strand includes a portion identical to all or part of the probe on the solid support and the second strand comprises a 5\u2032 portion complementary to all or part of the probe.",
                                "The amplified DNA is labeled before it is hybridized to a probe on a solid support. The amplified DNA is hybridized to probes which are immobilized to known locations on a solid support, e.g., in an array, microarray, high density array, beads or microtiter dish. The presence of labeled amplified DNA products hybridized to the solid support indicates that the nucleic acid sample contains at the polymorphic locus a nucleotide which is the same as the 3\u2032 terminal nucleotide of the first primer. The quantities of the label at distinct locations on the solid support can be compared, and the genotype can be determined for the sample from which the DNA was obtained.",
                                "Two or more pairs of primers can be used for determining the genotype of a sample. Each pair of primers specifically amplifies a different allele possible at a given SNP.",
                                "The hybridized nucleic acids can be detected, e.g., by detecting one or more labels attached to the target nucleic acids. The labels can be incorporated by any convenient means. For example, a label can be incorporated by labeling the amplified DNA product using a terminal transferase and a fluorescently labeled nucleotide. Useful detectable labels include labels that can be detected by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical, or chemical means. Radioactive labels can be detected using photographic film or scintillation counters. Fluorescent labels can be detected using a photodetector.",
