                "The present invention relates to a method for determining given renal disorders or the risk of developing renal disorders in a patient by measuring a VCAN parameter.",
                "Renal disorders, also called nephropathies, are diverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features including the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, and urinary tract obstruction.",
                "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is in the clinical setting described as acute renal failure (ARF) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and refers to the spontaneous and significant decrease in renal function. AKI therefore reflects the entire spectrum of ARF, recognizing that an acute decline in kidney function is often secondary to an injury that causes functional or structural changes in the kidneys. ARF is a frequent and serious problem with a variety of adverse short- and long-term clinical consequences. Loss of function of the kidney, a vital organ, in the form of acute renal failure represents a special hazard, in particular to older patients, despite modern therapies including the use of the various forms of artificial kidney. In diagnosis and prognosis care must be taken to differentiate between functional renal insufficiency and intrinsic injury with morphologic damage.",
                "AKI in particular in the intensive care unit is often associated with multiple organ failure and sepsis. Furthermore, AKI is associated with high mortality and morbidity in humans. Patients, for instance, experience AKI in ischemic reperfusion injury, along with treatment with nephrotoxic compounds including but not limited to antibiotics or anticancer drugs, application of contrast media e.g. when performing angiography resulting in nephropathy or nephrotoxicity, or at the intensive care unit, e.g. in the context of sepsis. The annual number of patients receiving contrast media is more than 100 million in the developed countries, and the rate of acute kidney injury ranges in a percent range, if coupled to risk factors like hypotension or diabetes.",
                "AKI is usually categorised according to pre-renal, intrinsic and post-renal causes.",
                "Pre-renal (causes in the blood supply):\n\n\n- - hypovolemia (decreased blood volume), usually from shock or\n    dehydration and fluid loss or excessive diuretics use.\n  - hepatorenal syndrome, in which renal perfusion is compromised in\n    liver failure\n  - vascular problems, such as atheroembolic disease and renal vein\n    thrombosis (which can occur as a complication of the nephrotic\n    syndrome)\n  - infection usually sepsis, systemic inflammation due to infection\n  - severe burns\n  - sequestration due to pericarditis and pancreatitis\n  - hypotension due to antihypertensives and vasodilators",
                "Intrinsic (damage to the kidney itself):\n\n\n- - toxins or medication (e.g. some NSAIDs, aminoglycoside antibiotics,\n    iodinated contrast, lithium, phosphate nephropathy due to bowel\n    preparation for colonoscopy with sodium phosphates)\n  - rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue)\u2014the resultant release of\n    myoglobin in the blood affects the kidney; it can be caused by\n    injury (especially crush injury and extensive blunt trauma),\n    statins, stimulants and some other drugs\n  - hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells)\u2014the hemoglobin damages the\n    tubules; it may be caused by various conditions such as sickle-cell\n    disease, and lupus erythematosus\n  - multiple myeloma, either due to hypercalcemia or \u201ccast nephropathy\u201d\n    (multiple myeloma can also cause chronic renal failure by a\n    different mechanism)\n  - acute glomerulonephritis which may be due to a variety of causes,\n    such as anti glomerular basement membrane disease/Goodpasture's\n    syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis or acute lupus nephritis with\n    systemic lupus erythematosus",
                "Post-renal (obstructive causes in the urinary tract) due to:\n\n\n- - medication interfering with normal bladder emptying (e.g.\n    anticholinergics).\n  - benign prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer.\n  - kidney stones.\n  - due to abdominal malignancy (e.g. ovarian cancer, colorectal\n    cancer).\n  - obstructed urinary catheter.\n  - drugs that can cause crystalluria and drugs that can lead to\n    myoglobinuria and cystitis",
                "According to the state of the art, renal failure is diagnosed when either creatinine or blood urea nitrogen tests are markedly elevated in an ill patient, especially when oliguria is present. Previous measurements of renal function may offer comparison, which is especially important if a patient is known to have chronic renal failure as well. If the cause is not apparent, a large amount of blood tests and examination of a urine specimen is typically performed to elucidate the cause of acute renal failure, medical ultrasonography of the renal tract is essential to rule out obstruction of the urinary tract.",
                "An exemplary consensus criterium for the diagnosis of AKI is at least one of the following:\n\n\n- - Risk: serum creatinine increased 1.5 times or urine production of\n    less than 0.5 ml/kg body weight for 6 hours\n  - Injury: creatinine 2.0 times OR urine production less than 0.5 ml/kg\n    for 12 h\n  - Failure: creatinine 3.0 times OR creatinine more than 355 \u03bcmol/l\n    (with a rise of more than 44) or urine output below 0.3 ml/kg for 24\n    h\n  - Loss: persistent AKI or complete loss of kidney function for more\n    than four weeks\n  - End-stage Renal Disease: complete loss of kidney function for more\n    than three months.",
                "A rapid increase in serum creatinine may also be an indicator for a high AKI risk following medical treatment, e.g. impairment in renal function is indicated by an increase in serum creatinine by more than 0.5 mg/dl or more than 25% within 3 days after medication.",
                "Kidney biopsy may be performed in the setting of acute renal failure, to provide a definitive diagnosis and sometimes an idea of the prognosis, unless the cause is clear and appropriate screening investigations are reassuringly negative.",
                "To diagnose AKI, usually urine and blood tests are done and the volume of urine produced is monitored.",
                "The gold standard for diagnosing AKI is the measurement of serum creatinine. Unfortunately, creatinine as marker has several limitations. On the one hand, levels of serum creatinine widely vary among individuals depending on age, sex, muscle mass or medication status. On the other hand, serum creatinine does not accurately depict kidney function during acute changes in glomerular filtration as it is a marker, which can only be interpreted in steady state. Furthermore creatinine levels do not rise until damage is severe and kidney function already declines. Other biomarkers such as lipocalin 2 (LCN2), also known as NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM1), cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), or interleukin 18 (IL18) have recently been proposed as alternative parameters for the detection of acute kidney injury.",
                "Patients with normal kidney function are currently not tested for any renal disease biomarkers. In the absence of any functional kidney disorder, such as urine volume reduction or creatinine level, it is assumed that there is no risk for developing AKI. However, there are patients, who have the potential to develop AKI upon certain medical treatment, which could be damaging to the kidney function, such as simple radiography using a contrast medium or chemotherapy. Several risk factors for acute renal failure have been identified so far.",
                "High-risk patients are considered those with chronic diseases that can affect the kidneys like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Pregnant patients who suffer from eclampsia, a hypertensive condition, also have a high risk for kidney damage.",
                "Some drugs are nephrotoxic, i.e. poisonous to the kidney, and therefore damaging to the kidneys. This includes certain antibiotics like aminoglycosides, anti-inflammatory drugs and the contrast media used in specific X-ray tests of the urinary tract. A need therefore exists for a marker which can be used to specifically and reproducibly detect the presence of, or predisposition to acquiring AKI clinically leading to ARF.",
                "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 13% of the general population and its prevalence is steadily rising. Progressive loss of kidney function is accompanied by increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and bone metabolism disorders, and the treatment of end-stage renal disease is a major healthcare challenge. Since the natural history of CKD shows a high intraindividual variation reliable histological and serological markers capable to differentiate between stable and progressive disease are heavily needed. Published data on biomarkers predicting progression are scarce, and their significance is often limited.",
                "The increasing prevalence of patients on renal replacement therapy has become a major challenge for healthcare systems. Frequently, end stage renal disease (ESRD) is the terminal phase of a chronic process. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of progressive kidney disease could lead to the development of new treatment options which might be able to stabilize renal function and reduce the incidence of ESRD. In order to use new but also the already available drugs even more efficiently, it is also highly desirable to identify patients with an adverse renal prognosis in the early phases of the disease as not all subjects show a relentlessly progressive decline in renal function. In this context the magnitude of proteinuria has been suggested to be a useful risk marker, even though, on an individual basis, the discriminatory power is questionable. Other biomarkers such as apolipoprotein A-IV",
                "(APOA4), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), or fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) have recently been proposed as alternative parameters to predict the course of disease.",
                "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. Around 50% of deaths of patients with end-stage renal disease are caused by cardiovascular complications. At the same time almost all patients with ESRD show signs of renal osteodystrophy, a heterogeneous pattern of bone metabolism disorders caused by chronic renal insufficiency and concomitant diseases.",
                "The elevated risk of CVD in chronic kidney patients is partly based on traditional risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Next to these traditional risk factors a number of biomarker candidates are discussed in the scientific literature to be predictive for cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease although none is used in the routine diagnostics so far. These marker candidates are involved in processes of inflammation, oxidative stress, or vascular calcification among others.",
                "Several proteins have been identified as molecular biomarker candidates of kidney damage. The clinical significance of these heterogeneous biomarkers is rather difficult to compare due to the variety of clinical settings in which they have been tested such as AKI, diabetic- and non-diabetic CKD, polycystic kidney disease, and dysfunction of kidney grafts. However, their predictive power for progressive decline of kidney function has not been tested in all cases. Moreover, the expression of some of these markers is not kidney specific or restricted to the kidney, and therefore their levels can be influenced by certain non-renal pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, diet, or concomitant medication.",

Thus, under designated assay conditions, the reagent binds to its particular target isoform and does not bind in a significant amount to another isoform or other molecules present in a sample. The specific determination in particular means that the readout is selective in terms of the individual target identity, thus differentiating from other, similar targets, such as other isoforms. The selective determination is usually achieved, if the target recognition is is at least 3 fold different, preferably at least 5 fold different, preferably at least 10 fold different, preferably the difference is at least 100 fold, and more preferred a least 1000 fold.",

When the expression of VCAN was evaluated, it was surprisingly found that the isoforms V0 and V1, but not V2 and V3, were appropriate markers to determine progressive disease. By an exemplary method according to the invention it was found that the expression of the isoforms V0 and V1 was significantly higher in patients with progressive disease (V0: 3.7 fold, p=0.0025; V1: 2.1 fold, p=0.014). The isoform V2 was not expressed in these samples, and no differences of the expression of the isoform V3 between stable and progressive subjects was found. In an extended study these results have been confirmed. To evaluate which cells in the kidney might contribute to VCAN expression, the basal expression of all VCAN isoforms was determined in vitro. VCAN isoforms V0 and V1 were highly expressed in various epithelial tubule cell lines and in skin fibroblasts, but to a much lesser extent in foreskin fibroblasts, prostate epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and colon carcinoma cells. Versican has also been determined by immunohistochemistry in human kidney biopsies. Versican mRNA was determined in a mouse model of glomerulonephritis. The differentiation of the versican isoforms according to the inventive method will provide for the improved determination of renal disorders.

We evaluated the expression of versican isoforms V0, V1, V2 and V3 in an independent cohort of 37 patients with various proteinuric kidney diseases (Table 2). The expression of versican isoforms V0 and V1 showed a significant negative correlation with eGFR at time of biopsy and with eGFR at time of follow up (FIG. 1). We did not detect any expression of the isoform V2 in these samples. The versican isoform V3 showed a weak downregulation in subjects with lower eGFR, which was statistically significant (p=0.011) but clinically irrelevant (FIG. 2). Patients were classified as stable or progressive according to changes in eGFR during a median follow-up time of 25 months (2-80 months). As shown in FIG. 2, the expression of the isoforms V0 and V1 was significantly higher in progressive disease (V0: 3.7 fold, p=0.0025; V1: 2.1 fold, p=0.014). The V2 isoform was not expressed in these samples. The versican isoform V3 was downregulated in progressive patients by 2%. No significant correlation of versican expression to proteinuria, the degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis nor the histological diagnosis could be detected. Linear regression analysis was performed for the different VCAN isoforms using the estimated GFR at follow up time as dependent variable. The expression of VCAN isoform 0 was negatively correlated with the estimated GFR (Pearson R=\u22120.54) and was the single most predictive VCAN isoforms explaining 27.7% (p-value <0.001) of the variability of the estimated GFR. The VCAN isoforms 1 explained 20.8% (p-value=0.002) of estimated GFR values at time of follow up. These results suggest a better predictive value of the versican isoforms V0 and V1 for progression of kidney disease, compared to established riskfactors such as degree of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and/or proteinuria."

We identified a massive basal expression of versican isoforms V0 and V1 in primary and immortalized human proximal tubule cells (FIG. 3) and in human skin fibroblasts. Other cells such as foreskin fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, prostate epithelial cells and colon epithelial cells showed a versican expression which was 100-1000 times less than in the kidney epithelial cells. Interestingly, whole kidney tissues from healthy controls did not show V0 and V1 expression, also pointing towards the use of VCAN for diagnosing chronic kidney disease at early stage. The levels of versican isoform V2 were extremely low in all cell lines studied, in particular in all renal epithelial cells. Although we detected some differences in the expression of the versican isoform V3, the differences were not statistically significant between the cells lines. We did not detect any of the versican isoforms in human endothelial cells. These data suggest a cell specific and probably an organ specific expression of the versican isoforms, and they represent preliminary results which are the basis for further studies of versican expression and regulation in kidney cells."

This information could be used to decide whether more aggressive therapies\u2014stronger blood pressure lowering, higher doses of RAAS blockade, intensified immunosuppression\u2014are of potential benefit for the individual patient. On the other hand the harms and benefits of such intensified therapeutic options should be carefully weighted in patients showing low biomarker expression levels thus having a potentially benign course of disease.",
                                "Using a bioinformatics analysis procedure of differential gene expression data we identified versican as a biomarker for histopathological damage in healthy kidneys, kidney grafts and in proteinuric kidney disease. In a second step we analysed the expression of versican in an independent cohort of 37 patients with various proteinuric kidney diseases and well-defined postbioptical clinical course with a median follow up time of 25 months (2-81 months; patients who were not on dialysis at end of follow-up had a follow-up time of 12-81 months). Two isoforms of versican (0 and 1) were significantly upregulated in those patients who showed a progressive loss of kidney function, suggesting that versican might serve as a potential predictive biomarker for progressive renal failure already at time of biopsy.",
                                "Versican is an extracellular matrix protein, which belongs to the family of hyaluronan-binding proteoglycans that include aggrecan, neurocan and brevican. These proteins have been grouped together on the basis of their structural similarity, and their ability to bind to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) hyaluronan. This specific feature has also led to the collective term \u201chyalectins\u201d. Each of the members shows a specific tissue distribution with aggrecan being mainly expressed in cartilage, and neurocan and brevican being confined to central nervous tissue. In contrast to these rather restricted expression patterns, versican appears to show a much wider tissue distribution with expression in a variety of soft tissues. The gene and protein structure of the hyalectins show highly conserved N- and C-terminal domains: The globular amino-terminal domain (G1) is responsible for binding to hyaluronan (sometimes called \u201chyaluronan binding region\u2014HABR\u201d), while the C-terminal domain resembles the selectin family of the proteins consisting of C-type lectin, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and a complement regulatory region (often called the \u201cEELC domain\u201d, or G3 domain). The middle GAG binding region, however, shows little resemblance between the members of this family of proteins. While aggrecan contains up to 100 GAG side chains attached to this region, brevican, neurocan and versican contain only few chondroitin side chains. To date five isoforms of versican (V0, V1, V2, V3 and Vint) have been identified, which in most (V0, V1, V2, V3) but not all (Vint) cases result from alternative splicing of the two central exons 7 and 8 encoding the central glycosaminoglycan carrying regions, glycosaminoglycan alpha and beta (Dours-Zimmermann et al J Biol Chem 1994; 269: 32992-32998). The isoform V0 is the largest splice variant containing the N-terminal domain, both GAG-domains and the C-terminal EELC domain. The isoform V1 contains the GAG-beta but not the GAG-alpha and the isoform V2 contains the GAG-alpha but not the GAG-beta domain. The isoform V3 lacks both GAG domains resulting in no GAG attachement sites and therefore no GAG side chains. The size of the respective isoforms is predicted to be approximately 370 kDa for V0, 265 kDa for V1, 182 for V2 and 74 kDa for V3. Vint resembles an incomplete splice variant which probably retains the final intron in the carboxyterminal end of the protein. This isoform was identified by Lemire et al. (Lemire JM et al Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 1999; 19: 1630-1639) and its characteristics as well as pathophysioloigical role are unclear.",
                                "Versican is expressed in healthy adult kidneys only at low levels. In chronic kidney disease increased versican expression is found in renal tissue with higher histopathological damage scores. Renal versican V0 or V1 mRNA expression is significantly higher in patients showing a progressive course of CKD than in patients with stable renal function. We demonstrated the propensity of this biomarker on the level of mRNA, indicating the propensity also on the level of protein."

The sections were fixed in cold acetone and incubated at room temperature for 60 min with a 1:400 dilution of the primary antibody (rabbit anti-human Versican, Santa Cruz, sc-25831, Santa Cruz, Calif., USA). Versican was detected by the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif., USA, www.vectorlabs.com) and stained with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole. This system uses a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000), avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase and the corresponding chromogen for visualization. All sections were counterstained with 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole.",
                                "Versican protein was expressed in several compartments of the kidney biopsies. The weakest expression was found in the glomeruli (FIG. 5 A), while the strongest expression was found in the tubulinterstitial compartment, both in tubuli (FIG. 5 B) and in the interstitial fibroblasts and in areas of fibrosis (FIG. 5 C). Interestingly, Versican was also expressed in the media of some but not all renal cortical blood vessels (FIG. 5 D).",
