## EXAMPLES

- introduce chronic kidney disease
- motivate biomarkers for CKD progression

### Example 1

- describe patient selection and kidney biopsies
- outline RNA isolation and real-time PCR
- present results: versican isoform expression in kidney biopsies
- correlate versican expression with eGFR and disease progression
- analyze cell culture results: versican expression in epithelial and mesenchymal cells
- summarize findings: versican as a biomarker for CKD progression

### Example 2

- describe patient selection and kidney biopsies
- outline RNA isolation and real-time PCR
- present results: versican isoform expression in kidney biopsies
- correlate versican expression with eGFR and disease progression
- analyze cell culture results: versican expression in epithelial and mesenchymal cells
- summarize findings: versican as a biomarker for CKD progression

### Discussion

- discuss potential of biomarkers for CKD management
- summarize versican as a biomarker for CKD progression
- describe versican structure and function
- discuss potential of versican as a predictive biomarker

### Example 3

- describe glomerulonephritis mouse model and versican expression results

### Example 4

- perform immunohistochemistry
