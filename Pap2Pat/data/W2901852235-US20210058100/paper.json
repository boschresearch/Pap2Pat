    "title": "A Simple Relaxation Scheme for Polar Codes",
    "date": "2018-10-01",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a simple relaxation scheme to reduce the encoding and decoding complexity of polar codes is introduced. Unlike the conventional relaxation schemes, the proposed technique relies on selecting relevant encoding/decoding nodes based on initialized relaxation attribute values and their extension to the remainder of the encoder and decoder stages. We show that the proposed relaxation scheme provides comparable BLER performance to the conventional polar codes by numerical simulations, while having significant complexity reduction.",

                "The polar codes was introduced in [1] and has been studied intensively in the literature due to its capacity achieving performance with relatively low complexity. Recently, the polar codes has been adopted as a channel coding scheme for control channel in 3GPP NR (New Radio) standardization [8]. Furthermore, its applicability as one of main channel coding candidates for the terabit per second and THz communication is also under investigation. [12] As a method to reduce complexity and latency of polar encoding and decoding, a method denoted as relaxation scheme is introduced and analyzed in [2]. The relaxation scheme has the benefit of complexity reduction without loss of performance under proper selection of relaxed nodes.",
                "In [3][4][5][6], the relaxation scheme is extended as \"irregular polar code\" and it is shown that additional complexity reduction gain can be achieved via more sophisticated procedures that are based on the calculation of mutual information.",
                "The approaches for relaxation in [2] and [3][4][5][6] are based on a similar procedure to conventional polar code construction [7] where the error probability of all nodes or union bound needs to be calculated in conjunction with the process of code construction. In this case, floating point calculation with high precision is required which incurs substantial calculation complexity, and hence limiting the practicality of these techniques.",
                "To tackle this limitation, in one approach, the information corresponding to the relaxed nodes can be stored in memory after off-line calculations, which than can be used for the underlying relaxation operations in encoding and decoding process. However, the memory requirements in this approach increases exponentially with the block length. Moreover, this approach also undermines some problems in code flexibility, as that would entail additional memory requirement for each possible code rate and block length.",
                "In this paper, a simple relaxation scheme which can be incorporated to polar encoding and decoding is introduced. In Section II, we provide the high level summary of the polar codes and its encoding operations. In Section III, the conventional relaxation methods are shortly described. The proposed relaxation scheme is provided in Section IV and the numerical results are given in Section V. Section VI concludes this paper."

The group of selected polarization units that has the lowest error probability is finally determined and used for overall inactivation. The selection of inactivated polarization units by exhaustive methods are impractical as the combination of selected group can be excessive (for instance, it is combinations in case of [3]). To overcome this issue, a greedy, lower-complexity approach is proposed where code construction of selecting frozen bits can also be derived with the inactivation group selection. [3] The irregular polar code can have better complexity gain than the relaxed polar code as it includes more combinations of candidate nodes group for inactivation. In [3], a simple example that demonstrates a better error rate performance by inactivated polar codes compared with the standard polar codes is provided under BEC (Binary Erasure Channel)."
