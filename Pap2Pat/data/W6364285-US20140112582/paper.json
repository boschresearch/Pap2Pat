    "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for Bengali character recognition based on view-based approach. Both the top-bottom and the lateral view-based approaches have been considered. A layer-based methodology in modification of the basic view-based processing has been proposed. This facilitates handling of unequal logical partitions. The document image is acquired and segmented to extract out the text lines, words, and letters. The whole image of the individual characters is taken as the input to the system. The character image is put into a bounding box and resized whenever necessary. The view-based approach is applied on the resultant image and the characteristic points are extracted from the views after some preprocessing. These points are then used to form a feature vector that represents the given character as a descriptor. The feature vectors have been classified with the aid of k-NN classifier using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a distance measure. A small dataset of some of the compound characters has also been considered for recognition. The promising results obtained so far encourage the authors for further work on handwritten Bengali scripts.",

                "Character recognition has been a popular field of research for past few decades. Research, in this arena, has been done not only on Bengali but also on some other languages [3], [4], [13], [17]. In [3], a method for handwriting recognition is proposed for Polish alphabet. It is based on Toeplitz matrix minimal Eigen values approach. In [4] a Template Matching based signature recognition algorithm is presented. In [13] a successful trial was made to recognize both typewritten and handwritten English and Arabic texts without thinning on the basis of region growing segmentation. In this work, however, and following the view-based approach of [5], the Bengali language is studied for automatic recognition. Recognition of Bengali script has a lot of importance. Bengali is one of the most popular languages in India. All over the world more than 200 million people speak in Bengali and this is the second most popular script next to Devanagari in India. It also suggests the scripts of two other languages, Assamese and Manipuri. Bengali is the official language of Bangladesh, a neighbour of India.",
                "Recognition of Bengali printed as well as handwritten characters [9], [11] has been a popular area of research in the arena [1], [2], [6] of OCR for past few years as found in the literature. Research is being done on the recognition of both the basic [10] and compound [9] Bengali characters. Attempts have also been made in the recognition of Bengali numerals [13], [18]. The modern Bengali alphabet set consists of 11 vowels and 39 consonants. These characters are called basic characters. Bengali text is written from left to right. The concept of upper/lower case is missing in Bengali. Most of the Bengali characters have a running horizontal line on the upper part of the characters; this line is known as Matra.",
                "Characters in Bengali are not alphabetical as in English (or Roman) where the characters largely have one-sound one-symbol characteristics. It is a mixture of syllabic and alphabetic characters [9]. The use of modified and compound characters is also very common in Bengali. This paper presents methods for recognizing Bengali printed characters based on view-based approach. Both the top-bottom and the leftright-view-based approach have been considered. This work is an extension of [6]. In this paper we have considered unequal partitions of the character images. Also a set of compound characters have been considered for view-based analysis.",
                "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 is a short review of the existing literature. Section 3 describes the major functional steps involved in the recognition process and feature extraction methods. In section 4 the concept of unequal partitioning is presented followed by the considerations for compound characters. Classification and experimental results are given in section 5."

                "Different techniques have been found in the literature for optical character recognition. The curvelet transform has been heavily utilized in various areas of image processing.",
                "In [10] a novel feature extraction scheme is proposed on the basis of the digital curvelet transform. The curvelet coefficients of an original image as well as its morphologically altered versions are used to train separate k-nearest neighbour classifiers. Output values of these classifiers are fused using a simple majority voting scheme to arrive at a final decision. In [22] a method has been suggested based on curvature-based feature extraction strategy for both printed and handwritten Bengali characters. BAM (Bidirectional Associative Memories) neural network has been used in [19] for Bengali character recognition. The conventional methods are used for text scanning to segmentation of a text line to a single character. An efficient procedure is proposed for boundary extraction, scaling of a character and the BAM neural network which increases the performance of character recognition are used. In [20] a modified learning approach, using neural network learning for recognizing Bengali characters, has been presented. Research has been done on the recognition of handwritten Bengali characters [14]. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained by back-propagation (BP) algorithm have been used as classifier. In [18] an automatic recognition scheme for handwritten Bengali numerals using neural network models has been presented.",
                "A Topology Adaptive Self Organizing Neural Network is first used to extract from a numeral pattern a skeletal shape that is represented as a graph. Certain features like loops, junctions etc. present in the graph are considered to classify a numeral into a smaller group. If the group is a singleton, the recognition is done. Otherwise, multilayer perceptron networks are used to classify different numerals uniquely. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used for both online and offline character recognition systems for different scripts around the world. A OCR program that uses HMM, for recognition process, has been made for Bengali documents in [12]. For using HMM it is required to have a sequence of objects to traverse through the state sequence of HMM. So the features are shaped into a sequence of objects. For each character component, a tree of features is made and finally the prefix notation of the tree is applied to the HMM. In the tree, the number of child of a node is not fixed, so, the child-sibling approach is applied to make the tree. Hence the prefix notation of the tree will contain nodes in the order: root, prefix notation of the tree rooted at its child, prefix notation of the trees rooted at the child's siblings from left to right order. After that HMM is used for the recognition purpose. Attempts have also been made on methods of segmentation and recognition of unconstrained offline Bengali handwritten numerals [13]. A projection profile based heuristic technique is used to segment handwritten numerals. A neural network based classifier is used for classification purpose. Paper [23] addresses various aspects of the problems associated with processing and recognition of printed and handwritten Bengali numerals. A scheme is proposed in this work for recognizing handwritten as well as printed numerals with different fonts and writing styles including noisy and occluded numerals. Polygon approximation is used to represent the contours of the letters. After that Fourier descriptors are used as shape features. The standard Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) augmented with MAXNET was used as a classifier. In [21] a method has been presented based on primitive analysis with template matching to detect compound Bengali characters. Most of the works on Bengali character are recognition of isolated characters. Very few papers deal with a complete OCR for printed document in Bengali. In [17] a chain code method of image representation is used. Thinning of the character image is needless when chain code representation is used. The main difficulties in printed Bengali text recognition are the separation of lines, words and individual characters. In [16] a new approach has been proposed to segment and recognize printed Bengali text using characteristic functions and Hamming network. A new algorithm has been proposed to detect and separate text lines, words and characters from printed Bengali text. The algorithm uses a set of characteristic functions for segmenting upper portion of some characters and characters that come under the Base line. It also uses a combination of Flood-fill and Boundary-fill algorithm for segmenting some characters that cannot be segmented using traditional approach. Hamming network is used for recognition scheme. Recognition is done for both isolated and continuous size independent printed characters. In [15] a study has been made on handwritten Bengali numerals."

                                "The \"views\" of given object are examined to extract from them a characteristic vector, which describes its shape. The view is representation of the coordinates of the points lying on one of four boundaries of the object (top, bottom, left or right)it consists of pixels belonging to the contour of a word and having extreme values of x (for left and right view) or y coordinate (for top and bottom). The conventional preprocessing stage of thinning is not essential here because in this approach only the shape of the character is analyzed. However, and in some cases, as will be seen later, the thinning process helps improve the results. The binarization is required to convert the scanned image into a black-and-white one. The main feature extraction step is to take out all the characteristic points from the views. Thus, characteristic vector for top view consists of maximal values from each pixelcolumn on an image. To reduce dimensionality of obtained vectors one can introduce some form of down-sampling. In our case it is equivalent to searching for characteristic points in each view that describes the shape. In [7] several methods of selecting these points have been explored. In the method used in this paper, characteristic values are found by dividing original vectors into n identical segments, and calculating mean value for each one. In this way four characteristic vectors describing the given letter is found. Next, these four vectors are transformed into a one vector, which describes the given letter",
                                "The top-bottom view based approach cannot be directly applied to Bengali characters. This is because most of the Bengali characters have a line known as the \"Matra\" on top of them. So, the top view for almost every character (except a few characters that do not have a Matra on top of them) is same. So the Matra should be removed first; after that the character without Matra can be processed for feature extraction using top-bottom view-based approach. Matra removal phase is not necessary if only lateral-view based approach is applied for feature extraction. But here both the lateral as well as top-bottom view based approaches have been applied, so removing Matra is necessary.",

It tells whether the pixel-column (or row) contains one or several strokes, as is presented in Figure 3. This way some information about the inner shape of the letters can be obtained. For example two Bengali characters Ja and Sha have been considered here. Both the characters look exactly the same as far as the contour is concerned. The only difference is in the internal shape of the characters. Layer based approach can be applied to distinguish these letters. The same can be done for pixel rows. With the use of layer-counting (layer-view), improvements in results have been achieved for word recognition as in [15]. Two variations of this approach have been considered. In each pixel column the number of changes of colour from white to black and black to white is counted. The same approach is performed for the pixel rows.",

For example, to obtain the top and bottom views, the image is divided horizontally into lower and upper parts. Then a bottom view of the upper half and a top view of the lower one can be obtained. Similarly, for the right and left view -the internal view of the left and right halves is created.

Component basic characters may retain their shapes in the compound character. Figure 4 shows two groups of compound characters. In the first group, the shapes of the component basic characters are retained in the compound one whilst in the second group, the basic shapes of the component characters are not retained. So if the compound character is segmented properly then the basic component characters can be extracted out of it and on the basis of information of the component characters, the compound character can be identified. But as shown in Figure 4, first group, that no specific segmentation method applies well for all the compound characters. For the characters at line 1 and 2 a horizontal segmentation works well.",

This compound character contains no clue of the basic components. So no segmentation can be done for recognizing such characters.",

In this paper view-based approach is applied for performing this recognition task. The idea is that the contour of each compound character is unique. So, applying view-based approach a feature vector can be formed for each of the compound characters. This feature vectors should be stored in a vector codebook database. Whenever a character has to be identified, the view-based approach is applied to it to form a feature vector. This vector is then compared with those at the codebook to find a similar match. This way a compound character can be identified."
