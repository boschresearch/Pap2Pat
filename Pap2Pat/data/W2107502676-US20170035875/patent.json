                        "Field of the Invention",
                        "The inventive subject matter comprises an immune enhancing composition comprising a recombinant protein derived from the dengue virus non-structural NS3 helicase. The recombinant protein is useful in vaccine formulations to provide enhanced immunity against antigens including dengue virus antigens.",
                        "Description of Related Art",
                        "Dengue is a rapidly emerging mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral infection of humans, with an estimated 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide. It has been estimated that the dengue viruses (DENVs) cause 50-100 million clinically apparent infections and up to 50,000 deaths each year. DENVs are members of the family Flaviviridae and are comprised of four antigenically related serotypes (serotypes 1-4). Most clinical infections result in a self-limited, acute febrile illness called dengue fever (DF), however, several hundred thousand cases of severe life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) also occur annually. The risk of DHF and DSS appears to be increased by the presence of antibodies from a previous dengue infection. This is hypothesized to be due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection by preexisting \u201cenhancing\u201d antibodies which form immune complexes capable of increasing viral infection in Fc receptor-bearing monocytic cells and macrophages. Due to the risk associated with secondary infections, ideally, a successful vaccine candidate would have to confer equal and effective protection against all four serotypes simultaneously.",
                        "A successful DENV vaccine currently remains an elusive goal. Several groups are currently evaluating live attenuated DENV vaccine candidates in clinical trials (Guy, et al., Vaccine, 29: 7229-41 (2011); Coller, B. A., D. E. Clements, Current Opinion in Immunology, 23: 391-8 (2011); Durbin, A. P., S. S. Whitehead, Viruses, 3: 1800-14 (2011); Schmitz, et al., Vaccine, 29: 7276-84 (2011); Edelman, R., Expert Review of Vaccines, 10: 133-6 (2011)); Thomas, S. J., Journal of Infectious Diseases, 203: 299-303 (2011); Endy, et al. PloS Neglected Tropical Diseases, 5:e975 (2011)). Major obstacles for the development of live virus vaccines include low seroconversion rates, prolonged immunization schedules, and sometimes, vaccine reactogenicity. As an alternative, non-replicating vaccines have been developed that could potentially shorten the dosing schedule and provide a safer preparation that can be administered to children, chronically ill or immunosuppressed individuals. The recently licensed Vero cell-derived purified inactivated vaccine (PIV) for Japanese encephalitis, for example, induced high-titer and long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses within two months (Kaltenbock, et al., Vaccine, 27: 4483-9 (2009)).",
                        "A purified inactivated DENV-2 PIV candidate has been developed which contains DENV C, prM, and E antigens, along with smaller amounts of NS1 antigen (Putnak, et al., J. Inf. Dis., 174: 1176-84 (1996)). This vaccine was tested in rhesus macaques where it was demonstrated to elicit virus neutralizing antibodies and protect against wild-type virus challenge three months after vaccination. A virus neutralizing antibody titer of 1:80 was estimated to be the minimum titer required for protection. In a subsequent study in rhesus macaques, a tetravalent DENV (TDENV) PIV administered on a 0, 30-day schedule, resulted in neutralizing antibody responses against all four DENV serotypes 1 month after the second dose (Simmons, et al., Virology, 396: 280-8 (2010)).",
                        "A recent report describes the protective antibody responses of a TDENV PIV against all four DENV serotypes in rhesus macaques (Fernandez, et al., Amer. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 92: 698-708 (2015)). In this study, animals received 2 \u03bcg (0.5 \u03bcg per serotype) of TDENV adjuvanted with 0.1% alum on days 0 and 28. All animals had a peak neutralizing antibody titer one month after the second dose against each of the four DENV serotypes. Groups of animals were challenged with live DENV-2 or DENV-1 on days 252 (32 weeks post-dose 2) and 308 (40 weeks post-dose 2), respectively. There was no measurable viremia after DENV-2 challenge and only 0.2 mean days of viremia in the group that was challenged with DENV-1. However, most animals had detectable RNA in their serum (RNAemia) over several days after challenge, indicating sterile immunity was not achieved. The authors commented that vaccine-induced cell mediated immunity (CMI) may play a critical role in reducing viral load after infection. While these results suggest that the DENV PIV vaccine may elicit high-titered virus neutralizing antibodies, it might not be as effective at eliciting cell-mediated immune responses and conferring long-term protection (Simmons, et al., J. Virology, 80: 9577-85 (2006)). Thus, there remains the continued need for more efficacious dengue vaccines, including dengue PIV vaccines which provide longer term protection against DENVs. Specifically, there is a continuing need to develop a more effective purified inactivated dengue virus vaccine that can stimulate humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity."

                        "The two effector arms of the immune system relevant to protection from viral disease in humans are neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As part of the adaptive immune response, na\u00efve T cells encounter specific antigen in the context of MHC class I (CD8+ T-cell epitopes) or MHC class II (CD4+ T-cell epitopes) molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). T cells proliferate and differentiate into a mixture of short-lived effector cells and long-lived memory cells. The CD4+ effector cells fall into two functional classes of helper T cells (TH): TH1 cells, whose function is to activate macrophages to eliminate intracellular pathogen; and TH2 cells, which activate B cells to make antibody and to promote the development of memory cells. CD4+ T cells are also crucial for the generation of functional and protective antigen-specific CD8+ T cells which have the unique capability of killing infected cells and are therefore important for viral clearance. The goal of an effective vaccine is to generate specific memory cells that can prevent future infections and disease.",
                        "As discussed briefly above, cell-mediated immune responses may be important in conferring long-term protection in a subject (Simmons, et al., J. of Virology, 80: 9577-85 (2006)). How T cells contribute to the immune response in dengue disease has not been clearly defined. It has been hypothesized that the dengue virus nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protein may be useful as an additional vaccine component due to its stimulation of cell-mediated immunity (Stephenson, J. R., Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 99: 643-6 (2005)). Indeed, NS3 is considered the main target for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses during dengue infection and may be involved in protection (Mathew A, Rothman A L., Immunol Rev. 225:300-13 (2008); Rothman A L. J Clin Invest. 113:946-51 (2004); Appanna R, et al., Clin Vaccine Immunol., 14:969-77 (2007). In a comprehensive analysis of the T cell response in Vietnamese adults, more than half recognized DENV-2 NS3 CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes (Simmons C P, et al. J Virol. 79:5665-75 (2005)). This study identified 30 T-cell epitopes on the NS3 protein with 24 (80%) within the helicase domain. Because T cells do not recognize intact virions, dengue virus-specific T cells would not be able to provide sterilizing immunity against viral infection.",
                        "In addition to a variety of T cell responses, immune responses induced by dengue virus infection can include antibody responses to various structural and nonstructural proteins. For example, antibodies to non-structural protein NS1 have been reported to protect mice against challenge with dengue virus (Falgout B, et al., J Virol., 64:4356-63 (1990); Schlesinger J J, et al., J Gen Virol., 68:853-7 (1987); Zhang Y M, et al. J Virol. 62:3027-31 (1988)). Purified inactivated vaccines contain structural proteins C, prM, E and non-structural protein NS1, with the E protein containing most of the epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibodies (Whitehead SS, et al., Nat Rev Microbiol. 5:518-28 (2007)). DNA vaccines containing nucleotides coding for prM and E proteins are disclosed in Beckett C G, et al., Vaccine, 29:960-968 (2011). Recombinant subunit vaccines containing prM and truncated E proteins are disclosed in Coller B A et al., Vaccine, 29:7267-75 (2011). Antibodies against structural proteins prM and E have been shown to neutralize flaviviruses (Bray M, et al. J Virol. 1989 63:2853-6 (1989); Kaufman B, et al., DTIC Document, 1989)).",
                        "Anti-NS3 antibodies have been detected in human sera of patients with primary and secondary DENV infections (Vald\u00e9s K, et al., Clin Diagn Lab Immunol., 7:856-7 (2000); Churdboonchart V. et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg. 44:481-93 (1991)). Notably, although purified recombinant NS3 proteins were able to induce strong anti-NS3 antibody responses in mice, they were not neutralizing antibodies (Vald\u00e9s K, et al., Clin Diagn Lab Immunol., 7:856-7 (2000); \u00c1lvarez-Rodriguez L M, et al., J Trop Med. 2012; 2012; Ramirez R, et al., Virus Genes, 49:185-95 (2014)). Studies employing a DNA vaccine based on NS3 from Japanese encephalitis virus provided only partial protection against live virus challenge (Konishi E, et al. Vaccine, 21:3675-83 (2003)). Other studies using a DNA based vaccine encoding NS3 from tick-borne encephalitis virus revealed absence of protection in mice, whereas a vaccine encoding NS3 in addition to E2 glycoprotein indicated an increased neutralizing antibody response and IFN-\u03b3 responses induced by CD4+ T helper cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Morozova O V, et al. Viral Immunol. 12:277-80(1999); Rau H, et al., Vet Res. 37:155-68 (2006)).",
                        "We investigated the possibility of developing a more effective purified inactivated dengue virus vaccine that would reliably stimulate humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity in a subject. Specifically, we evaluated the incorporation of recombinant subunit NS3 proteins representing protease and/or helicase as components of a DENV-2 PIV vaccine to determine if they generate better T-cell responses than the DENV PIV vaccine alone. As described in detail in the below examples, our studies unexpectedly revealed that in addition to stimulation of cell-mediated immunity, NS3 protein is also a potent modulator of humoral immune responses to dengue antigen. In particular, it was discovered that the helicase region of the NS3 protein could significantly enhance not only the cell mediated immune response against antigens, but also enhance the production of virus-specific antibodies as well as neutralizing antibodies and thus positively modulate an anti-dengue immune response in a subject. While the exact mechanism of action is not completely understood, the immune enhancement observed may be similar to that produced by an adjuvant.",

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the dry pellets stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. The bacterial pellets were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blot. For the purification, pellets were resuspended in Bugbuster extraction reagent (Novagen Inc, Madison, Wis.) containing 0.1% Benzonase and 0.01% rLysozyme and incubated at RT for 20 minutes with gentle rocking. The cellular suspension was centrifuged at 15000\u00d7g for 15 minutes and the supernatant removed.

The supernatant was loaded onto a HisPur Ni-NTA affinity column (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). The column was washed with several resin bed volumes of 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.9, 60 mM imidazole until the absorbance of the flow-through fraction at 280 nm approached baseline. His-tagged proteins were eluted with 8 M urea, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mMTris-HCl pH 7.9, 1 M imidazole. Peak fractions were pooled and refolded by dialysis in PBS in a stepwise manner containing urea in decreasing amounts (6 M, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M every hour and no urea overnight at 4\u00b0 C.). The dialyzed preparations were concentrated using centrifugal filters with a 10K membrane cut off (Amicon, Ireland). Purified proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blot. The presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in the purified recombinant protein preparations was determined using a Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) colorimetric assay (Genscript, Piscataway, N.J.).

Serotype specific IgG antibody titers of sera from immunized mice were measured by ELISA using DENV-2 antigen. FIG. 2 shows detectable antibody on day 8 was seen only in the virus control group with a geometric mean titer of (GMT) 661. By day 22, the highest reciprocal endpoint dilution titer was seen in the virus control group (GMT=90677), followed by the groups that received PIV-Hel (GMT=75858), PIV-Pro (GMT=25119) and PIV only (GMT=794). On day 35, the GMT for the PIV only group rose to 21135, whereas all other groups indicated a slight decline in antibody titer. No antibody to DENV-2 virus was detected in the adjuvant control group, as well as the groups that received protease or helicase alone. Mice that received either protease or helicase did have IgG antibody to their respective recombinant NS3Pro or NS3Hel in the ELISA (data not shown) indicating the lack of NS3 protein in our DENV-2 antigen preparation.",
                                "Neutralizing antibodies against DENV-2 were then assayed by 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 50) on day 35 (FIG. 3). A similar pattern was observed, with the virus control group showing the highest PRNT 50 GMT of 2228, followed by PIV-Hel with a GMT of 380, PIV-Pro 67 and PIV only group with a GMT of 31. There were no neutralizing antibodies detected on day 22 in any of the groups except one animal in the PIV-Hel group with a titer of 1:36. Similarly, no neutralizing antibody titers were seen in the adjuvant control group as well as the animals receiving protease or helicase preparations. Our results indicate that PIV combined with NS3Hel can generate higher total antibody as well as higher neutralizing antibody titers to DENV-2 in mice than PIV administered alone (p=0.0029).",
                                "Non-replicating virus or protein vaccines induce T-dependent responses and require adjuvants to enhance the antibody response. Aluminum salts are frequently used and are included in a majority of currently available vaccines. These adjuvants allow for the slow release of antigen, thereby extending the duration of B cell and T cell activation. The inclusion of additional epitopes on the helicase in our study may have acted as another form of immune modulator by providing additional differentiation and activation signals to monocytes and dendritic cells. This could explain the increased virus-specific IgG antibody (memory) response observed in the PIV-Hel group after the second dose, leading to a significant boost in neutralizing antibody titer after the third immunization.",
                                "The addition of helicase to the PIV also resulted in activation of the cellular arm of the immune response as evidenced by the increased IFN-\u03b3 response in the PIV-Hel group. CD8+ T cell responses are elicited by vaccines that introduce antigens within the cytosol, and induction of strong CD8+ T cell responses is currently limited to infectious live-attenuated viral vaccines. For non-replicating vaccines the dose of antigen is important for the induction of memory responses. Non-replicating vaccines require sufficient antigen content in addition to adjuvantation for optimal T cell expansion during priming. The addition of a relatively high dose (75 \u03bcg) of T cell epitope(s) to the PIV may have increased the magnitude of the initial T cell expansion. For non-replicating vaccines, booster administration is then oriented towards optimization of the primary expansion phase. The persistence of memory B cells and T cells for long-term vaccine efficacy was not evaluated in this study. In our study, the immune-potentiating properties of the recombinant DENV-2 protease (NS2b-aa90 to NS3-aa196) and helicase (NS3-aa174 to aa560) as a source of T cell epitopes in combination with the DENV-2 PIV were evaluated in mice.",
                                "The recombinant protease in our study contains all 6 previously identified CD4+ and CD8+ peptide sequences of the protease domain, and the helicase contains 19 (79%) of the 24 previously identified human helicase T-cell epitopes. In addition, the recombinant helicase contains a murine CD8+ (H-2Kd) CTL epitope at amino acids 298 to 306 (GYISTRVEM), which was previously shown to be serotype and flavivirus cross-reactive in mice (Spaulding A C, et al. J Virol. 73:398-403 (1999).",

Furthermore, Costa et al. has reported that plasmids encoding only the NS3 protease domain did not result in protection, whereas plasmids based on the complete NS3 sequence or the helicase portion resulted in less morbidity and partial protection in mice (Costa SM, PLoS One 6(10):e25685 (2011)). Similarly, the protease domain in our study did not elicit IFN-\u03b3 responses and only a minimal increase in neutralizing antibody titer was observed. In contrast, however, in our studies, the helicase domain resulted in a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3 responses and neutralizing antibody titers when compared to the PIV alone."

Whole or subset depleted cells stained with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies are shown in FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C and the depletion process resulted in >98% of depletion of each subset. Stimulation with overlapping NS3 peptides in the ELISPOT showed a strong IFN-\u03b3 response in the CD8+ depleted cells but not in the CD4+ depleted cells. CD4+ T cell depleted cells had low levels of IFN-\u03b3 similar to the control (unstimulated cells) (FIG. 5D). These results indicate that the observed IFN-\u03b3 secretion following co-immunization with DENV-2 NS3 helicase is due to CD4+ T cells.",
                                "CD8+ depletion analysis revealed that the IFN-\u03b3 response observed in our study is the result of CD4+ T cells. IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells generated by vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were shown to protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Vogelzang A, et al. J Infect Dis. 210:1928-37 (2014)). A protective antiviral role of CD4+ T cells were also reported for West Nile virus. In one study, CD4+ T cells were shown to help the antibody response, were important for clearance of virus from the CNS and maintaining (but not priming) the CD8+ T cell response (Sitati E M, Diamond M S. J Virol. 80:12060-9 (2006)). Another study found West Nile virus-specific CD4+ T cells exhibited direct antiviral cytokine secretion (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) and cytotoxicity sufficient for protection (Brien J D, et al. The Journal of Immunology 181:8568-75 (2008)). DENV-specific CD4+ T cells were shown to be involved in supporting B cell antibody production but also play a direct role in viral clearance through production of IFN-\u03b3 and expression of CD107a (Rivino L, et al., J Virol. 2012:JVI. 02675-12. The contribution of CD4+ T cells to protect against flavivirus infection is virus-specific and may depend on the experimental system used.",

Our results indicate that incorporating recombinant NS3 helicase protein as a component of DENV vaccines, and particularly the DENV-2 PIV, may synergistically generate a more effective immune response."
