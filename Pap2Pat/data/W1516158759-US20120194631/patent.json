    "title": "FUNCTIONALITY FOR INDICATING DIRECTION OF ATTENTION",
    "date": "2011-02-02 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A communication system is described herein which provides an indicator that helps hub participants of a meeting (or other environmental setting) determine a direction of attention of a satellite participant (who is not physically present at the meeting). The indicator can be implemented as a mechanical pointer, a solid-state display mechanism, a rotating display mechanism, a display mechanism which presents visual information that reflects directionality, and so on. The communication system can assess the directionality of the satellite participant based on any combination of control inputs from explicit input mechanism(s) and/or implicit input mechanism(s). The communication system can also choose between explicit and/or implicit control of the indicator based on at least one selection criterion.",

In conventional systems, the meeting room may include a display mechanism and one or more speakers which together present an audio-visual representation of the remote participant. The meeting room also includes one or more cameras and one or more microphones which together capture an audio-visual representation of one or more participants who are physically present in the meeting room. The local participants in the meeting room are referred to herein as hub participants because they define the core locus of the meeting. The remote participant is referred to as a satellite participant because he or she represents a person who is attending the meeting from a remote location.",
                        "Videoconferencing technology has enjoyed significant commercial success. Yet there are various instances in which this technology does not provide a fully satisfactory user experience. For example, consider the scenario in which the satellite participant directs a question or comment to a specific hub participant. It is often difficult for the hub participants to determine the target of the satellite participant's question or comment. This is because the visual representation of the satellite participant does not preserve some of the subtle communication cues by which people normally determine the directionality of a speaker's message.",
                        "For instance, the hub participants may notice changes in the satellite participant's head or eye gaze. But these cues are ambiguous in the visual representation of the satellite participant. When the satellite participant is looking straight ahead, each hub participant may perceive the satellite participant as looking directly at him or her, individually (an effect typically experienced when watching a TV newscaster). And when the satellite participant is looking to one side, each hub participant may perceive the satellite participant as looking to his or her left or right (but not aimed at anyone specifically).",

Videoconferencing technology may suffer from yet other shortcomings Further, other environments (besides videoconferencing environments) may experience similar difficulties to those set forth above."

In one implementation, the communication system operates by receiving an explicit control input from at least one explicit input mechanism, and/or an implicit control input from at least one implicit input mechanism. The explicit control input reflects an express indication of the first entity's direction of awareness (as specified by the first entity), while the implicit control input reflects an inferred indication of the direction of awareness of the first entity. The communication system processes these control inputs to provide an explicit control output and/or an implicit control output, respectively. A mode selection module selects at least one of the explicit control output and the implicit control output based on at least one selection criterion, to generate a selected control output. An output mechanism then adjusts a position of an indicator based on the selected control output. In one environment, the indicator may assist a second entity (such as a hub participant) in determining the direction of awareness of the first entity.",

                        "FIG. 1 shows an illustrative communication system 100 for determining the direction of awareness of a first entity and conveying that direction of awareness to one or more second entities. In the context most often evoked herein, the communication system 100 can be applied to a hub-and-satellite meeting environment. In this context, the first entity corresponds to a remote participant to a meeting that takes place at a physical location (a \u201cmeeting location\u201d herein). This participant is referred to as a satellite participant. The second entity corresponds to one of the participants who is physically present at the meeting location. This participant is referred to as a hub participant. In this situation, the communication system 100 provides cues which help each hub participant determine the person (or object) that the satellite participant is looking at, referred to herein as the target object.",
                        "In one environment, the meeting between the hub participants and the satellite participant takes place using videoconferencing functionality 102. The videoconferencing technology 102 includes at least one microphone and at least one video camera for capturing an audio-visual representation of the satellite participant. This equipment is provided at the remote location of the satellite participant. The videoconferencing technology 102 further includes at least one display mechanism and at least one speaker provided at the meeting location for presenting the audio-visual representation of the satellite participant. The videoconferencing technology 102 also includes at least one microphone and at least one video camera for capturing an audio-visual representation of the hub participants. This equipment is provided at the meeting location. The videoconferencing technology 102 further includes at least one display mechanism and at least one speaker provided at the remote location for presenting the audio-visual representation of the hub participants to the satellite participant. By virtue of this equipment, the satellite participant can take part in the meeting in a virtual fashion.",
                        "Many examples will be set forth below in which a single satellite participant interacts with two or more hub participants. However, these examples are representative, not exhaustive. In another environment, for instance, two or more satellite participants interact with two or more hub participants. The satellite participants can interact with the communication system 100 from the same remote location or different respective locations. In this context, the communication system 100 can provide an independent indication of the direction of awareness for each satellite participant. Moreover, in this scenario, the communication system 100 can provide an output mechanism at the remote site(s) which determines the direction of awareness of any hub participant. In other words, for example, the communication system 100 can provide a first indicator which indicates the direction of awareness of a satellite participant (for the benefit of the hub participants), and a second indicator which indicates the direction of awareness of a hub participant (for the benefit of the satellite participants).",
                        "In another environment, the meeting room can include a single hub participant. This means that the satellite participant cannot possibly be looking at several hub participants; nevertheless, the communication system 100 can help the single hub participant determine what object the satellite participant is looking at. For example, the communication system 100 can indicate whether the satellite participant is looking at the single hub participant, a whiteboard, a collaborative workspace, or some another object.",
                        "In another environment, the satellite participant is not physically remote from the hub participants, but may, in fact, be present in the same meeting room as the hub participants. In this situation, the communication system 100 can help disambiguate the direction of awareness of the satellite participant (where, in this case, the term \u201csatellite\u201d no longer connotes remoteness). For example, the satellite participant may wish to provide such a cue because he or she is disabled and cannot readily engage in typical communication cues, although he or she is physically present in the same room with the hub participants.",
                        "In another implementation, the communication system 100 can provide an indication of the direction of awareness of the satellite participant in some environment other than a meeting room. For example, the satellite participant may be controlling a robot proxy of any type in any environment, e.g., to perform a task in a dangerous environment (to cite merely one example). The satellite participant can use the communication system 100 to convey his or her direction of awareness to individuals in the vicinity of the robot proxy.",
                        "In another implementation, the communication system 100 can provide an indication of the direction of awareness in a context in which one or more hub participants correspond to non-human agents of any type.",
                        "Still further applications of the principles described herein are possible. However, as stated above, the following explanation will emphasize the representative scenario in which a single satellite participant interacts with plural hub participants.",
                        "The communication system 100 includes an attention determination module 104. The attention determination module 104 receives control input from one or more input mechanisms 106 (referred to in the singular for brevity below). The control input provides information which has a bearing on the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. In other words, the control input provides information which indicates what object(s) the satellite participant is looking at. Based on this information, the attention determination module 104 generates a selected control output, which it sends to one or more output mechanisms 108. The output mechanisms 108 adjust a position of at least one indicator to convey the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. Each of these components of the communication system 100 will be set forth in turn below.",
                        "Starting with the input mechanisms 106, the input mechanisms 106 can include one or more explicit input mechanisms 110 and/or one or more implicit input mechanisms 112. The explicit input mechanisms 110 includes mechanisms by which the satellite participant expressly (e.g., manually) indicates his or her direction of awareness. For example, the explicit input mechanisms 110 can include knobs, joy sticks, key input mechanisms, mouse devices, touch-sensitive input mechanisms, and so on. Additional details regarding one manner in which a satellite participant may convey his or her direction of awareness will be set forth in greater detail below. The explicit input mechanisms 110 provide an explicit control input to the attention determination module 104.",
                        "The implicit input mechanisms 112 include mechanisms which produce information from which the direction of attention of the satellite participant can be inferred, e.g., without the satellite participant being asked to expressly indicate that information. For example, one type of implicit input mechanism includes a head position determination mechanism. This input mechanism determines the position and orientation of the satellite participant's head and/or other body parts. Another type of implicit input mechanism includes an eye gaze detection mechanism. This input mechanism determines the position of the satellite participant's eyes, e.g., by detecting the reflection of infrared light from the corneas of the eyes. The implicit input mechanisms 112 provide an implicit control input to the attention determination module 104. The attention determination module 104 can use this implicit control input to determine what object(s) lie within the presumed field of view of the satellite participant.",
                        "The implicit input mechanisms 112 can also receive other cues which have a bearing on the direction of attention of the satellite participant's awareness. As will be described below, this additional information allows the attention determination module 104 to either bolster or detract from its conclusion as to the direction of the participant's awareness. For example, the implicit input mechanisms 112 can receive information regarding events that take place in the course of the meeting. For example, one such event may indicate that a hub participant has started speaking Another event may indicate that someone has opened up a document on a collaborative workspace or approached a whiteboard, etc.",
                        "The attention determination module 104 includes an explicit control processing module 114 for processing the explicit control input from the explicit input mechanisms 110. The explicit control processing module 114 generates a conclusion from the explicit control input regarding the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. This operation may involve determining target object(s) of interest that correspond to a position that is manually specified by the satellite position. The operation then involves determining a position that the indicator (of an output mechanism) can be moved to so as to point to the target object(s). In one implementation, these determinations can be performed based on any type of mapping information which translates the explicit control input to an indicator position. The output of the explicit control processing module 114 is referred to herein as an explicit control output.",
                        "In addition, or alternatively, the attention determination module 104 includes an implicit control processing module 116. The implicit control processing module 116 processes the implicit control input from the implicit input mechanisms 112. Like its explicit counterpart, the implicit control processing module 116 generates a conclusion from the implicit control input as to what the satellite participant is looking at, referred to as an implicit control output herein. In one implementation, this operation may involve determining a field of view that is defined by the satellite participant's head position and orientation, and/or the direction of the participant's gaze. The implicit control processing module 116 can then determine the target object(s) within this field of view. The operation then involves determining a position that the indicator (of the output mechanism) can be moved to so as to point to the target object(s).",
                        "The implicit control processing module 116 can also take into consideration other events that have a bearing on the satellite participant's head position and/or direction of gaze. The events can be used to help confirm (or detract from) a conclusion as to what object the satellite participant is looking at. For example, the implicit control processing module 116 can draw a tentative conclusion based on a control input from a head detection mechanism that the satellite participant has turned his or her gaze towards a particular hub participant. Further assume the implicit control processing module 116 determines that the hub participant started speaking just before the satellite participant turned his or her head. This confluence of events makes it more likely that the satellite participant did in fact turn his or her head towards the particular hub individual in question.",

Based on at least one selection criterion, the mode selection module 118 chooses which control output is to govern the output mechanisms 108. In one case, the mode selection module 118 determines that the explicit control output is to govern the output mechanisms 108. In another case, the mode selection module 118 determines that the implicit control output is to govern the output mechanisms 108. In another case, the mode selection module 118 determines that some combination of the explicit control output and the implicit control output is to govern the output mechanisms 108. In another case, the mode selection module 118 determines that neither the explicit control output nor the implicit control output is to govern the output mechanisms 108",

If just the explicit input mechanism(s) 110 are used, the mode selection module 118 can be used to control the activation/deactivation of the explicit input mechanism(s) 110; similarly, if just the implicit input mechanism(s) 112 are used, the mode selection module 118 can be used to control the activation/deactivation of the implicit input mechanism(s) 112. Alternatively, the communication system 100 can entirely eliminate the mode selection module 118.",

For example, the mode selection module 118 can generate a conclusion that the satellite participant is looking at a particular object only if the satellite participant trains his or her attention on that object in a consistent manner for at least a predetermined amount of time. The output of the mode selection module 118 is referred to herein as a selected control output.",

Here, the communication system 100 uses the selected control output to adjust the position of a mechanical pointer. A second category of output mechanisms corresponds to solid-state vane mechanisms 122. Here, the communication system 100 uses the selected control output to illuminate selected elements in an array of solid-state indictors (e.g., LEDS or the like).

The conferencing services 208 can be implemented by one or more server computers provided at a central site or distributed over plural sites.",
                        "The functions described in connection with FIG. 1 can be mapped to the devices shown in FIG. 2 in many different ways. To cite one example, in one scenario, the attention determination module 104 can be implemented by a computer provided at the same remote site as the satellite participant. But in another example, the attention determination module 104 can be implemented at least in part by a computer provided at the physical meeting location (e.g., the location of the hub participants).",
                        "Now advancing to FIG. 3, this figure provides a depiction of three hub participants (302, 304, 306). The hub participants (302, 304, 306) are physically present in a meeting room 300 or other hub environment. FIG. 3 also shows a display mechanism 308 having a display screen which presents a visual representation 310 of a satellite participant who is physically present at a remote site, not at the meeting room 300. Although not shown, the meeting room 300 may include one or more speakers for providing audio information that originates from the satellite participant.",

Although not shown, the meeting room 300 can also include one or more microphones which capture audio information which originates from the hub participants (302, 304, 306). Although not shown, the satellite participant has a counterpart display mechanism and speaker(s) for together presenting an audio-visual presentation of the meeting room 300, including the three hub participants. (FIG. 17, to be described in turn, shows one environment in which the satellite participant may operate.)",

The motor 314 drives the mechanical pointer 316 based on the selected control output provided by the attention determination module 104. In operation, the attention determination module 104 drives the mechanical pointer 316 to a position so that it points at a particular hub participant 302. This is based on the conclusion, made by the attention determination module 104, that the satellite participant is looking at this particular hub participant 302. Again, that determination can be made based on any combination of explicit control input and implicit control input.",
                        "The mechanical pointer 316 in this case is a brightly-colored elongate member, about five inches long, that rotates around a base stem of the display mechanism 308 (in as quiet a manner as possible). This is one of many examples. The mechanical pointer 316 can have any shape, size, color, and functionality. Further, the mechanical pointer 316 can be provided at any location within the meeting room 300. Or the indicator can include multiple mechanical pointers (not shown). Further, the mechanical pointer 316 can have any relationship with respect to other equipment provided in the meeting room 300. For instance, in one example, the base member of the display mechanism 308 can house the motor 314 which drives the mechanical pointer 316, but this is merely one option among many.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows the same meeting room 300 that was introduced in FIG. 3. The only difference is that the satellite participant has now presumably shifted his attention from hub participant 302 to hub participant 306. Accordingly, the attention determination module 104 drives the mechanical pointer 316 to a new location, at which it points at the hub participant 306.",
                        "In the examples set forth above, the hub participants (302, 304, 306) can make note of the position of the mechanical pointer 316 as they converse with the satellite participant. Using this approach, the hub participants (302, 304, 306) can be better informed as to the person(s) to whom the satellite participant is directing questions, comments, and/or gestures. Or, in some instances, the satellite participant may be just directing his or her attention towards a particular person without otherwise communicating with that person. For reasons set forth above, this awareness information cannot be readily determined solely based on the visual representation 310 of the satellite participant.",
                        "Furthermore, in the case in which explicit control input is provided, the satellite participant is now free to look straight ahead into the video camera, rather shifting his head to telegraph his direction of awareness. In some circumstances, this may provide better user experience for both the satellite participant and the hub participants. Namely, because the satellite participant is looking straight ahead into the video camera, the hub participant to which the indicator is pointed may perceive the satellite participant as looking directly at him or her.",
                        "Although not shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the meeting room 300 can include directional speaker(s) which direct audio information in a particular direction, e.g., by physically adjusting the direction in which one or more speakers are pointed and/or controlling the audio signals delivered to one or more speakers. This effect supplements the hub participants' perception of the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. For example, in FIG. 4, the directional speaker(s) can direct the voice of the satellite participant towards the hub participant 306, based on a determination that the satellite participant is directing his awareness towards this individual.",
                        "FIGS. 5-7 show three other ways of implementing a mechanical pointer. In FIG. 5, a mechanical pointer 502 is movably attached to (or in proximity to) a video camera 504 provided in the meeting room. In this example, the mechanical pointer 502 can be moved independently of the video camera 504. In FIG. 6, a mechanical pointer 602 is non-movably attached to a video camera 604. In this example, the mechanical pointer 602 cannot be moved independently of the video camera 604. In other words, the mechanical pointer 602 moves together with the video camera 604. In the examples of FIGS. 3-6, a motor (such as a servo motor) can move the mechanical pointers through some range of angles within a plane.",
                        "FIG. 7 shows an example in which a mechanical pointer 702 is movably attached to any type of base member 704. The base member 704 may be integrated with or separate from the display mechanism(s) and/or the video camera(s) provided in the meeting room. The base member 704 may house a motor (such as a servo motor) for moving the mechanical pointer 702 to any orientation within a three dimensional space, rather than a single plane. In this case, the mechanical pointer 702 can indicate whether the satellite participant is looking up or down, as well as left or right.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows an example of a solid-state output mechanism. Here, a base member 802 of a display mechanism 804 includes an array 806 of solid-state display elements, such as LEDs or the like. The attention determination module 104 can provide a control output which illuminates one or more of these solid-state display elements 808, to thereby convey the direction of the satellite participant's attention. For example, if a left-most element is illuminated, this means that the satellite participant is looking to the far left; if a right-most element is illuminated, this means that the satellite participant is looking to the far right. In another implementation, the output mechanism can provide a distributed collection of solid-state elements placed in proximity to respective hub participants. The communication system 100 can illuminate a solid-state element in proximity to a particular hub participant to indicate that the satellite participant's attention is being directed to that person.",
                        "FIG. 9 shows an example of an output mechanism that involves the rotation of a display mechanism 902. That is, the display mechanism 902 incorporates or is coupled to a motor (not shown). The motor moves the display mechanism 902 to a position based on the control output of the attention determination module 104. In other words, the attention determination module 104 drives the entire display mechanism 902 to a position which reflects the direction of attention of the satellite participant.",
                        "FIGS. 10-12 show an example in which the output mechanism is a display mechanism 1002 which represents visual information, such as graphical information and/or image information and/or video information, etc. The visual information, in turn, conveys the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. In FIG. 10, for instance, the visual information 1004 depicts a globe having a spot. The spot reflects the direction at which the satellite participant is presumed to be looking at the moment. In FIG. 11, the visual information 1102 depicts an overhead graphical representation of the meeting room or other hub environment. An arrow and/or spot in that depiction can indicate the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. In FIG. 12, the visual information 1202 corresponds to a panoramic representation of the meeting room as seen by the satellite participant. Any type of highlighting (or mark) applied to the panoramic representation can indicate the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. These examples are representative, not exhaustive. In another example (not shown), the visual information can comprise a list of names of individuals in the meeting room. The name of the person that the satellite participant is looking at can be highlighted in any fashion, and so on. This assumes that the respective names and positions of the hub participants have been registered in advance.",
                        "FIGS. 13 and 14 show two examples in which the output mechanism is a display mechanism which projects a visual representation of the satellite participant on a curved surface, that surface forming a display screen. For example, in FIG. 13, a cylindrical curved surface 1302 presents a visual representation 1304 of the satellite participant. In FIG. 14, a spherical curved surface 1402 presents a visual representation 1404 of the satellite participant. In operation, the attention determination module 104 adjusts the position of the visual representations (1304, 1404) on the curved surfaces (1302, 1402) based on the presumed direction of awareness of the satellite participant, e.g., such that a normal that projects out from the representation of the satellite participant on the curved surfaces (1302, 1402) generally points in the direction of the target of awareness.",
                        "With reference to FIG. 13, one way to accomplish the above-stated functions is by providing a projection mechanism 1306 on a rotatable base at the center of the cylindrical surface (or spherical surface). The cylindrical surface can be implemented by translucent plastic or other material. The attention determination module 104 can then rotate the projection mechanism 1306 to a position that matches the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. At that location, the projection mechanism 1306 can project the visual representation 1304 of the satellite participant onto the curved surface 1302, where it is visible to the hub participants.",

The attention determination module 104 can rotate the hologram representation 1502 to a position which matches the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. Although not shown, other output mechanisms can achieve the same effect by rotating a physical model of the satellite participant's head (where this would constitute another variation of the mechanical pointer according to the terminology used herein). Although not shown, other output mechanisms can rotate an avatar representation of the satellite participant, and so on.",

Other hub participants may be positioned in the meeting room so that they can view and listen to the same audio-visual representation presented by the computing device 1602.

In the example shown in FIG. 16, the computing device 1602 presents an indicator 1604 that comprises visual information that is displayed on the display mechanism of the computing device 1602. More specifically, the visual information comprises an indicator circle having a movable dot; the position of the dot conveys the direction of awareness of the satellite participant. In the top part of FIG. 16, the dot indicates that the satellite participant's direction of awareness is directed at some person or object to the immediate right of the computing device 1602, e.g., because the dot appears at the right side of the indicator circle.",

The movement determination mechanism(s) 1606 determine changes in the position and/or orientation of the computing device 1602 to provide movement information. A position adjustment module 1608 receives the movement information from the movement determination mechanism(s) 1606 and the selected control output from the attention determination module 104. Based thereon, the position adjustment module 1608 produces a position control output. The position control output adjusts the position of the indicator 1604 so that it remains pointed at the target object, even though the position and/or orientation of the computing device 1602 may change.",

In response, the position adjustment module 1608 produces a position control output which results in the dot moving from the far right of the indicator circle (as shown in the top part of FIG. 16) to the middle of the indicator circle (as shown in the bottom part of FIG. 16). Once again, the computing device 1602 can include, or can otherwise be associated with, any type of indicator, such as a mechanical indicator, a solid state display mechanism indicator, and so on, or any combination thereof.",

The satellite participant 1702 can perform this function by expressly designating a portion 1706 of a visual representation of the meeting room provided on the display mechanism 1704. The environment 1700 can also include one or more implicit input mechanisms 112 which can infer the direction of awareness of the satellite participant 1702. For instance, the implicit input mechanisms 112 may include a head tracking mechanism which determines a position and orientation of the satellite participant's head, e.g., based on an image representation of the satellite participant's head captured by one or more cameras of any type(s), etc. The implicit input mechanisms 112 may also include an eye gaze determination mechanism which determines a direction of gaze of the satellite participant 1702, e.g., based on an image representation of the satellite participant's eyes captured by one or more cameras of any type(s), etc. The implicit control processing module 116 can use this implicitly-determined position information to cast a frustum out from the head of the satellite participant 1702. That frustum will intersect a plane defined by the screen of the display mechanism 1704, thus defining a particular portion 1706 of the visual representation of the meeting room which corresponds to the satellite participant's presumed focus of interest.",

In FIG. 18, a visual representation 1802 represents a graphical or video panoramic representation of the meeting room, e.g., as captured by the video camera at the meeting room. In FIG. 19, a visual representation 1902 represents an overhead graphical or video representation of the meeting room. In both cases, the visual representation (1802, 1902) depicts the hub participants in the meeting room.

In a first approach, the video representation of the meeting room encompasses the indicator, enabling the satellite participant to see the indicator on his or her display mechanism 1704. The satellite participant can then use the visual feedback provided by the display mechanism 1704 to manually move the indicator to a desired position, e.g., so that it points to a target of interest. The satellite participant can perform this task using any of the explicit input mechanism(s) 110.",

Upon the start of a meeting, each hub participant can then manually indicate where he or she is located within the meeting room. The attention determination module 104 can include mapping information which maps an explicit or implicit designation of a target object with an indication of a position within the meeting room, and which also maps an indication of the position within the meeting room with a pointer position. Hence, when the satellite participant identifies a particular hub participant, the control modules (114, 116) are able to generate a control output which moves the indicator to the appropriate position.",

For example, at the start of a meeting, the communication system 100 can determine the locations of the hub participants in an image of the meeting room, where that image may contain reference points which establish a frame of reference. Alternatively, or in addition, the communication system 100 can detect the locations of the hub participants in the meeting room based on the directionality of voices which originate from the hub participants. The control modules (114, 116) can leverage this information in the manner stated above for the second implementation, e.g., using mapping information to translate an explicit and/or implicit designation of a target object to a pointer position.",

The position adjustment module 1608 can further modify this control output based on the actual current orientation and/or position of the computing device 1602 within the meeting room. This is one implementation of this operation among many.
