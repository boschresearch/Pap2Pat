    "title": "Motion and Attention in a Kinetic Videoconferencing Proxy",
    "date": "2011-01-01",
    "abstract": "Compared to collocated interaction, videoconferencing disrupts the ability to use gaze and gestures to mediate interaction, direct reactions to specific people, and provide a sense of presence for the satellite (i.e., remote) participant. We developed a kinetic videoconferencing proxy with a swiveling display screen to indicate which direction that the satellite participant was looking. Our goal was to compare two alternative motion control conditions, in which the satellite participant directed the display screen\u2019s motion either explicitly (aiming the direction of the display with a mouse) or implicitly (with the screen following the satellite participant\u2019s head turns). We then explored the effectiveness of this prototype compared to a typical stationary video display in a lab study. We found that both motion conditions resulted in communication patterns that indicate higher engagement in conversation, more accurate responses to the satellite participant\u2019s deictic questions (i.e., \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d), and higher user rankings. We also discovered tradeoffs in attention and clarity between explicit versus implicit control, a tension in how motion toward one person can exclude other people, and ways that swiveling motion provides attention awareness, even without direct eye contact.",

                "Attention is fundamental to the flow of face-to-face conversations. Each participant projects cues of what he is paying attention to and other participants interpret these cues to maintain awareness of his locus of attention. This awareness helps them understand his deictic references. Both production and consumption of awareness cues occur at conscious and subconscious levels [1].",
                "Videoconferencing systems disrupt the link between attention projection and attention awareness. They do this in part because they do not faithfully reproduce the spatial characteristics of gaze, body orientation, and pointing gestures. This disruption is one of the reasons why video-mediated communication is less effective than faceto-face interaction. The lack of a shared physical environment further hampers participants\" abilities to use spatial cues to support conversation and direct attention [2,3]. Videoconferencing configurations that involve multiple people at one site offer multiple plausible loci of attention, increasing the potential for confusion. The proxy was operated by a confederate, and positioned so that its swiveling display approximately matched participant eye-height.",
                "We are particularly interested in videoconferencing systems to support hub-andsatellite meetings, where most participants are collocated except for one participant at a satellite location. This satellite is represented in the collocated space by a proxy device consisting of a display screen, camera, speaker, and microphone (Fig. 1). The satellite perceives the hub location through streams of audio and video displayed on his computer display.",
                "A study of proxies in everyday use has documented the benefits of a physical representation of the satellite in group interaction [4]. Our own use and studies of proxies in our day-to-day work has led to a design that includes a wide-field-of-view camera that shows most of the meeting room at the hub site (see Fig. 3). The satellite views this panorama of the hub room displayed in a window that is full-screen width across his display. Relative to this window, the satellite\"s camera is positioned horizontally centered and vertically as close as possible.",
                "This view gives the satellite a good sense of the spatial relationships among the people and objects in the meeting room. He can maintain awareness of the locus of attention for each of the hub participants. Because the camera the satellite views is positioned near the screen representing him, he has a good sense of when a hub participant looks directly at him or gestures toward him.",
                "The reverse, however, is not true. The hub participants have a general sense of whether the satellite is looking left, center or right, but nothing more fine-grained than that. The video mediation introduces too many invisible parameters, such as the field of view of the wide-angle camera and the size of the satellite\"s desktop monitor, preventing the hub participants from having a precise sense of the satellite\"s focus of attention. With the multiple potential foci of attention in a typical meeting (e.g., people, whiteboard drawings, artifacts), breakdowns occur when the hubs cannot determine the satellite\"s focus of attention.",
                "Moreover, the hub participants do not have a visceral sense of mutual eye contact with the satellite participant. When he looks straight at the camera, all of the hubs perceive him to be looking straight at each one of them. We call this the newscaster effect 1 [5]. When he looks to the left, none of the hubs perceive him to be looking directly at any of them, but instead experience him to be looking over their right shoulder. This disruption of eye gaze awareness adds to making it difficult for the hubs to maintain awareness of the satellite\"s focus of attention.",
                "A more subtle problem is that the satellite is just not as \"present\" as his collocated counterparts. We have observed several instances where people are talking in order around the table, e.g., to introduce themselves or report status, and the satellite on his proxy is skipped. We call this the skip-over effect. Despite the physical presence of the proxy, we believe there are many factors contributing to this deficit in presence.",
                "We sought to mitigate these problems by physically moving the proxy in response to the satellite\"s actions. We began with one degree of motion by putting the display of the proxy on a motorized turntable that is controlled by the satellite participant. We called this a kinetic proxy.",
                "To explore how kinetic proxy movement may address the newscaster and skip-over effects, we implemented several forms of motion control, and assessed hub participants\" perceptions of the differences. We performed a lab study of the prototype, comparing a stationary proxy, a kinetic proxy under the satellite\"s explicit control by mouse cursor, and a kinetic proxy controlled implicitly by the satellite\"s head motion. This is the first study to directly compare alternative ways to project attention and evaluate people\"s responses.",
                "The study\"s setting was a distributed conference consisting of several collaborative tasks. We used measures of conversation effectiveness such as engagement, naturalness of interaction, cognitive effort and sense of presence.",
                "We found that the kinetic conditions were generally better than the stationary condition, with interesting caveats. For example, screen motion toward one person is more akin to turning one\"s back (rather than one\"s head) toward someone else. We also found unexpected and previously undescribed benefits and drawbacks to both means of control of the kinetic proxy. Among these is that implicit control generates more incidental proxy motion, which increases the cognitive effort experience by hub participants. These findings suggest designs for future experimentation in kinetic proxies."

                "Researchers of interpersonal interaction recognize that the nuances of body orientation and non-verbal behavior-some consciously controlled, others not-are important parts of the messages that people send and receive when communicating in person. Goffman highlighted the difference between the expressions that people give and those that they give off [6]. The former are verbal signs of the content they want to communicate; the latter are nonverbal and contextual. The former are more conscious; the latter are more subconscious. Hall\"s study of proxemics formalized that, with cultural differences, the way people orient their bodies toward or away from one another indicates their degree of intent to engage in conversation [7]. Face-to-face is more direct, a 90-degree angle is more casual, and a 180-degree angle is more transitory and disengaged. The design and motion of the kinetic proxy, with its explicit and implicit forms of control, is inspired by these insights."

                        "There is a long series of research prototypes that have tried to improve gaze awareness in videoconferencing. Hydra [8] was a 4-way distributed meeting system that packaged a video camera, small display, microphone, and speaker in selfcontained, table-top surrogates dedicated to represent each participant at the meeting. Participants could look toward any of the other participants, and everyone would have an appropriate indication of his or her gaze. A study that compared mediated with same-room conversations found very similar patterns in overall speaking time, speech segment duration, and the distribution of turns taken. Our current study draws upon these same three conversational measures (among others).",
                        "More recent videoconferencing studies have also focused on gaze awareness. GAZE-2 [9] used several cameras at each site to capture video of each participant. The system detected which video window was being looked at by tracking each participant\"s eye movements. Each participant\"s video view was then shared with the other participants in a rendering of a virtual meeting room. Each video in the virtual room was presented as a flat screen, which was digitally skewed to face the remote participant toward which each participant was looking. These virtual screens rotated in a similar way to our single physical screen.",
                        "HP\"s Halo and Cisco\"s TelePresence are conference room-scale installations that support individual as well as group meetings. Because all of the participants at each site share the same views of the participants at the other site, correct gaze is not maintained as one moves to different positions within the room. The Virtual Window [10] sought to adjust for motion parallax such as this by tracking participants\" head motions and moving a remotely-operated camera to simulate the effect of looking through an opening directly into the remote space.",
                        "MultiView [11] preserved gaze and gesture spatial relationships for groups of participants in a two-site (extensible to three) conference. Multiple cameras at each site-one facing each participant-sent multiple video streams to a directional viewscreen at the other site. Positioning was carefully arranged so that every participant at one site had a correct, angle-adjusted view of every participant at the other site, relative to his or her seating locations."

[12] developed robots with movable heads to support turn-taking in their communications. These robots engaged humans in one-on-one monologue or simple dialog while orienting their heads toward people or objects of interest. The studies emphasized the coincident timing of robotic gestures with transitional words. Our work also explores how orientation cues can influence interaction, but in a highly collaborative context.",
                        "Such robots also act as agents rather than avatars. By representing themselves in an interaction rather than a human other, and by not simultaneously presenting live video of that remote other, they avoid the potential to both complement and contradict an operator\"s actions. Kinetic proxies take this hybrid approach to providing physical motion as well as onscreen video."

PRoP [13] was a series of explorations of mobile, robotic personal stand-ins, composed of a video camera and LCD panel (and later, a small pointer) mounted atop a vertical pole and connected to a drivable base. Due to mobility constraints, PRoP\"s primary means of directed gaze was through a pan-tiltzoom camera head, which served as a partial indicator of the operator\"s focus of attention, much like our proxies. But as we have found, this can be an ambiguous cue, as the camera may not always follow the operator\"s attention, or agree with his or her gaze. This overall form and interaction experience has recently appeared in commercial telepresence robots, including Willow Garage\"s Texai [14], Anybots\" QB [15], and InTouch Health\"s Remote Presence [16].",

The device included a video camera and display-replaced by a laptop computer in a later design-stereo speakers and microphones, all mounted atop a turntable and positioned on, or alongside, a conference table. Porta-Person and its turntable represent a direct lineage influence on the physical design of our kinetic proxy.",

A study found that the proxy displaying motion was more engaging and likable than without motion. The role of motion as an indicator of attention was not evaluated, and since the participant\"s head motion was tracked (only), alternative forms of control were not compared.",
                        "Though it is not a telepresence proxy, the RoCo prototype [19] is relevant because it uses physical motion to influence engagement. It consisted of an LCD screen mounted on a 5 degree-of-freedom robotic \"neck\" that could rotate, lean and gesture expressively, mirroring the posture of the person standing in front of it. Studies of RoCo demonstrated that the system could create emotional engagement. RoCo, with its gesture mirroring capability, was an inspiration for our implementation of implicit control.",

Instead, it had the ability to orient its own robot head, body and a pointing arm, which were controlled by tracking the operator\"s head movements, screen touches and joystick use.",

The system tracked the operator\"s yaw and pitch head motions and mirrored them on the avatar. An advantage of this approach was that it presented correct focus of attention cues for all of the individuals interacting with the avatar and over a broad range of viewing angles. It has not been systematically studied from a human-factors perspective."

For open-ended tasks such as ours, total speaking time is highly dependent on how comfortable participants feel, how many ideas come up, etc. Groups could have more turns (to propose ideas) as well as longer speech segments (to elaborate on them). This interpretation is confirmed by the differences in speaking time. Prior studies do not reveal a general trend: Angura [29] shares the negative relationship that we found, whereas Mutlu et al.

                "Our lab study results showed that motion in the kinetic conditions performed better than the Stationary condition in terms of conversational engagement, accurate responses to deictic prompts, and trends in user ranking, confirming H1. A participant illustrated these results with the comment, \"The motorized action brought the remote person to life.\" Hub participants were able to perceive the satellite\"s attention in motion through the swiveling of the display.",
                "However, we also discovered some tradeoffs with motion. The swivel motion of the display could clearly communicate focus of attention (\"Rotating LCD made it more clear who remote participant was talking to.\"). But, the more general locus of attention suffered, especially because swiveling toward one hub participant often meant that another hub participant was left looking at the edge of the display screen (\"\u2026when the remote person was talking to other people, I couldn\"t see her and I felt excluded.\"). Given the flat surface of the display screen, swiveling the display was more narrowly directional than the physical affordance of head and body orientation. We expect that these tradeoffs are the main reason why participants rated the motion conditions as lower in a sense of \"being there.\" Thus there was a tension in motion as it directed attention towards some hub participants but excluded others.",
                "Rotating the display also introduced delay in the conversation, especially when the satellite had to explicitly control the aiming of the display (\"\u2026and then kind of like these awkward interruptions, every time she turned.\"). Some also found the motion to be distracting (\"I felt like whenever she turned we all kind of like stopped talking for a second.\").",
                "Furthermore, aiming the display in the direction of the satellite\"s gaze did not address the eye contact issue. Especially in the Implicit condition, where turning the head was used to aim the display, the combination of swiveling the screen and having the head aimed off center from the camera combined to disrupt a true sense of eye contact (\"Seemed as if she was looking over my shoulder.\").",
                "Our lab study also illustrated the tradeoffs between explicit and implicit control of motion. Explicit control showed the intent of the satellite more clearly, and was preferred by the satellite confederate, but incurred a delay in operating the interface to aim the display. Some evidence for this delay is found in the longer speech segment measure for the Explicit condition compared to both Implicit and Stationary conditions. This measure may reflect protracted speech while the satellite is simultaneously aiming the direction of the proxy. Or, explicitly aiming the display may leave the satellite\"s \"gaze\" aimed at a conversation partner longer than natural, protracting the partner\"s speech turn until the display turns away.",
                "Implicit control tried to lessen the delay in moving the screen and reduce the cognitive burden on the satellite in aiming the display. However, it also added more ambiguity in the intention of the satellite, and the increased amount of motion exposes the hub to more of the negatives of motion (i.e., distraction, noise). Head motion in the physical world can be communicative (e.g., turning toward someone to elicit their response) or incidental (e.g., a side effect of not being able to remain completely still). But the kinetic display motion generated by the turntable was largely interpreted as communicative. Consequently, implicit control caused incidental head movement to be perceived as communicative movement, leading to more of a sense of distraction. In this way, implicit control transferred cognitive effort from the satellite to the hub.",
                "We also expected that hubs would perceive implicit control as more natural than explicit, as more of the satellite\"s gestures would be available to them, but we found mixed indications in the questionnaire responses. While our results are equivocal about H2, we have a richer understanding of the tradeoffs between explicit and implicit control.",
                "It is interesting that measures of behavior (sociometric turn-taking, deictic prompt responses) were more demonstrative than perceptual questionnaire responses. Some participants reported not even noticing that the display remained stationary during that condition. The behavioral measures showed that participants reacted to the motion conditions even though their perceptual rankings do not show statistically significant differences. Taken together, these results show that people\"s mechanisms of attention awareness may operate at a subconscious level, as has also been seen in other research [31]."

                "Returning the two practical problems with our proxy that prompted this exploration, do we believe that the kinetic proxy will address the skip-over and newscaster effects? Regarding the skip-over effect, we certainly believe the attention projection provided by motion will give the hub participants enough awareness of the satellite\"s attention to include her in the conversation. We look forward to deploying kinetic proxies into everyday usage to gain more experience with that. Regarding the newscaster effect, we set out to improve gaze awareness, in the tradition of the research prototypes reviewed earlier that have attempted to do so. Kinetic motion did provide a physical sense of gaze direction. However, it did not achieve eye contact, as the satellite\"s turning head turned the kinetic proxy display, but also caused her gaze to be directed off angle from the camera.",
                "Our study shows that despite not achieving true eye contact, the kinetic proxy does project the satellite\"s attention focus so that hub participants could have engaging conversations and correctly respond to deictic requests. Our experiences with the lab study have led us to explore teasing apart attention awareness from gaze awareness.",
                "Eye contact and gaze awareness are mechanisms used for attention projection and awareness when face-to-face. There has been a long series of research prototypes that have indicated how difficult it is to re-create eye contact and correctly convey gaze awareness in videoconferencing. But there are other mechanisms for conveying attention awareness without having to recreate eye contact. While Fels and Weiss [32] have begun to explore this space, we see more opportunities to support attention awareness without relying strictly on eye contact and gaze awareness.",
                "We set out to explore using motion to improve interaction with the satellite participant. We discovered that motion helps, but has some tradeoffs. Swiveling a flat display screen toward one hub participant often excludes other participants, which can diminish the sense of presence of the satellite. Plus, rotating the visual mass of a display incurs lag and some found it to be distracting. Furthermore, swiveling the display did not succeed in improving eye contact.",
                "Based on our study results, we would like to explore designs that leverage the benefits of physical motion, but avoid the exclusion of turning away from participants. Since swiveling the display still did not create true eye contact, perhaps there are ways to use a physical pointer, like a weather vane, to indicate attention projection while keeping the flat display stationary, so all hub participants maintain visual contact with the satellite. Alternatively, it would be interesting to explore convex displays, rather than the flat display screen, which might afford a wider range of directing a satellite\"s gaze while not \"turning her back\" on some participants.",
                "By distinguishing between gaze awareness and attention awareness, what we learned in our lab study generalizes beyond the particular turntable proxy that we examined. The motion of our turntable proxy did provide a stronger sense of attention projection and awareness, even though it did not offer true eye contact.",
                "Complementary to the approaches of re-creating eye contact in videoconferencing systems, we should also explore ways of providing attention projection and awareness which may not depend on gaze awareness. This approach may open up options that are mechanically simpler, more abstract, and perhaps more diverse than previous approaches for creating engagement through videoconferencing solutions.",
                "The current study focused on ameliorating the social asymmetries particular to hub-and-satellite teams. We have had meetings with multiple satellites in attendance by static proxy. In our experience, they have proceeded in much the same way-with comparable improvements in social integration but shortcomings in newscaster and skip-over effects-as meetings with single satellites. As we construct further prototypes, we hope to explore how interaction quality may differ (such as proxy-toproxy conversations) through the use of multiple kinetic proxies."
