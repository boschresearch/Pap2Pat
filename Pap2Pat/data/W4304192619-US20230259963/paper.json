    "title": "Disentangling Mixtures of Unknown Causal Interventions",
    "date": "2022-10-01",
    "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, such as gene knockout experiments, targeted interventions are often accompanied by unknown interventions at off-target sites. Moreover, different units can get randomly exposed to different unknown interventions, thereby creating a mixture of interventions. Identifying different components of this mixture can be very valuable in some applications. Motivated by such situations, in this work, we study the problem of identifying all components present in a mixture of interventions on a given causal Bayesian Network. We construct an example to show that, in general, the components are not identifiable from the mixture distribution. Next, assuming that the given network satisfies a positivity condition, we show that, if the set of mixture components satisfy a mild exclusion assumption, then they can be uniquely identified. Our proof gives an efficient algorithm to recover these targets from the exponentially large search space of possible targets. In the more realistic scenario, where distributions are given via finitely many samples, we conduct a simulation study to analyze the performance of an algorithm derived from our identifiability proof.",

                "Motivation: Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN) ( [Pea09,Spi10]), have become the popular choice to model causal relationships in many real-world systems. These models can simulate the effects of external interventions that forcibly fix target system variables to desired target values. The simulation is done via the do() operator ( [Pea09]) wherein the CBN is altered by breaking incoming edges of the target variables and fixing them to desired target values. Pre-estimating the effect of interventions can help in decision making, for example, interventions on a CBN describing gene interactions can guide gene editing experiments.",
                "However, real-world interventions are not always precise and mistakenly end up intervening other unintended targets. For example, gene knockout experiments via the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology perform unintended cleavage at unknown genome sites ( [FFK + 13, WWW + 15]). Moreover, the unintended intervention targets can themselves be noisy i.e. different individuals targeted by the same intervention might undergo completely different off-target interventions. For example, [AWL18] demonstrated that same gene editing experiment (using CRISPR-Cas9) on mice embryos exhibited different unintended cleavage for different mice. In such situations, units (samples) that underwent different unintended interventions are not segregated and therefore the generated distribution becomes a mixture of individual interventional distributions. We ask the following natural question. by C X . Unless otherwise specified, all random variables in this paper are discrete and have finite support i.e. |C X | < \u221e. A tuple or set of random variables is denoted by capital bold face letter (e.g. X) and the corresponding lower case bold faced letter x will denote the assignment X = x. Let, C X = \u220f X i \u2208X C X i denote the set of all possible values that can be taken by X. Probability of X taking the value x is denoted by P(X = x) or equivalently as P(x) and probability of X = x given Y = y is denoted as P(X = x|Y = y) or equivalently with P(x|y). We will use [n] to denote the set {1, 2, ..., n}, [m, n] to denote set {m, m + 1, . . . , n}, calligraphic capital letters e.g. S to denote sets. Size of any set S is denoted by |S|. R, R + and R \u22650 will denote the set of real numbers, positive real numbers and non-negative real numbers respectively.",

It allows for modeling effect of external actions called \"interventions\", by appropriate modification of the Bayesian Network. A formal definition of causal Bayesian Networks can be found in Definition 1.3.1, [Pea09].",
                "Interventions: As mentioned above, these capture external actions on a system under consideration, for example, dosage of medicines administered to a patient, providing subsidies to poorer sections of the population, etc. A natural way to model them in causal Bayesian Networks is to perform the act of causal surgery, wherein, incoming edges into the node(s) to be intervened are removed and the node(s) is forcibly fixed to the desired value. As described in Definition 1.3.1, [Pea09], the new network thus obtained is treated as the Bayesian Network modelling effect of the intervention. Formally, following the notation in [Pea09], if we perform intervention on nodes X \u2286 V with a desire to set it to value x * \u2208 C X , then the effect of this intervention (also known as interventional distribution) is a probability distribution on V denoted as P(v|do(x * )) (or P x * (v)). In the intervened Bayesian Network, conditional probability distributions (CPD) P(X i |pa(X i )) of all X i \u2208 X that are intervened and set to x * i , changes to the Kronecker delta function",

                "As motivated in Section 1, the intended interventions performed during an experiment often have hidden off-target effects, which could themselves be stochastic, leading to different hidden treatments on different individuals. We can model such a situation as an unknown mixture of different interventions. Here is a formal definition. Definition 3.1 (Mixture of Interventions). Let G = {V, E } be a causal Bayesian Network. A probability distribution P mix (V ) is called a mixture of interventions if for some m \u2208 N, there exist subsets T 1 , . . . , T m \u2286 V , corresponding values t i \u2208 C T i , and positive scalar weights",

Since our ultimate goal is to recover them from the mixture distribution (see Question 1.1), the problem only makes sense if they \"uniquely\" define the mixture.

                "In the general case, the answer to both these questions is no! Using a very simple network, with just one node, we show that mixture distributions need not be unique, motivating the need for more assumptions.",

                ", 0}. Therefore, uniqueness of intervention tuples does not hold in general.",
                "Even though the example looks very simple, it captures the main reason behind the non-identifiability of the set of intervention tuples. Exactly like the above example, for any mixture, we can obtain systems of linear equations by evaluating marginal probabilities of P mix for different settings of V . Our goal then would be to find settings which help us solve these systems uniquely and recover the set of intervention tuples. Unfortunately, in this process, similar to the above example, the linear systems will have dependent equations and therefore infinitely many solutions. To get over this issue, we focus our attention on sets of intervention tuples, where, for each variable there exists some value that is missing from all of it's intervention targets. In, our main theorem, we show that any mixture generated by such a set cannot be generated by any other set of this kind. Next, we formally state the assumption and then discuss why it is extremely mild and reasonable in most real situations. Assumption 3.1 (Exclusion). Let T be a set of intervention tuples as defined in Definition 3.1. We say that T satisfies exclusion, if for all V i \u2208 V , there exists vi \u2208 C V i such that vi / \u2208 t for any target t belonging to any tuple in T . We say that a mixture of interventions P mix (V ) satisfies exclusion if some set of intervention tuples T generating it satisfies exclusion.",
                "Remark 3.1. This assumption puts only a mild constraint on the set of mixtures we consider. For example, in a network with n nodes and each node having \u2264 k possible values, excluding a fixed value of each node, can still generate arbitrary mixtures over \u2126(k n ) allowed targets. Without exclusion, there are O((k + 1) n ) possible targets that generate the mixtures. Therefore the reduction is minimal compared to the size of the space of targets we are searching in. In real-world applications, it's common for nodes to have a large number of possible values. Therefore, for each node, the possibility of off-target interventions impacting all values becomes unlikely. We also emphasize that the values missing from the targets can be different for different input mixtures and are not known to our algorithms. Our identifiability algorithm only uses existence of such missing values making its interpretation even more general.",
                "Even though the above assumption helps us tackle the singularity problem outlined in Example 3.1, it is not enough to guarantee uniqueness of intervention tuples in general. We also assume a simple \"positivity\" assumption on the causal Bayesian Network, which demands that the joint probability P(v) > 0 for any setting V = v. In fact, using the same example as above (Example 3.1), we show that not assuming p 0 , p 1 > 0, can lead to multiple set of intervention tuples satisfying Assumption 3.1 and generating the same mixture. To see this, we consider the input mixture P mix (V ) = P(V ). The set of intervention tuples T 1 = {(\u2205, 1)} for it clearly satisfies Assumption 3.1 as intervention targets (V 1 = a) and (V 1 = b) are excluded. Now, if p 1 = 0, then P 0 (V 1 ) = P(V 1 ) and for any \u03c0 0 \u2208 [0, 1], we can trivially write",
                "} is another set of intervention tuples for P mix , implying non-uniqueness. Here is the statement of our assumption. Assumption 3.2 (Positivity). Let V be the set of nodes in our causal Bayesian Network and P(V ) be the corresponding joint probability distribution. We assume that P(v) > 0 for all v \u2208 C V . Remark 3.2. As a straight forward consequence of this assumption, for every random variable V i \u2208 V , we can show that the conditional probability distributions are positive as well i.e. P(v i |pa(v i )) > 0 for all v i \u2208 C V i and setting pa(v i ) of the parents. This positivity assumption is commonly assumed in many works related to causal graphs. For example, [HB12] assume positivity throughout their discussion when characterizing the Interventional Markov Equivalence class.",

                "For each simulation setting (N, M)5 we randomly sample a directed acyclic graph on N nodes (each having 3 categorical values), from the Scale-Free (SF) model ( [BA99]), with number of edges chosen uniformly randomly from the set of integers [N, 5N]. Given this graph, we model the conditional probability distribution of each node as a multinoulli distribution with Dirichlet priors having fixed parameter \u03b1 = 2 for all categories. This is done to conform with Assumption 3.2. This generates our causal Bayesian Network G. We estimate marginal probabilities of the joint distribution defined by G by generating M samples using ancestral sampling on the network. Now, to create input instances, we first choose an integer m uniformly randomly from the set [4, 16] and use this as the number of intervention tuples in the mixture. Then we iterate from 1 to m to build each intervention target of the mixture. First, we choose the size of the target by picking an integer r uniformly randomly from the set {0, . . . , N}. Then we uniformly randomly choose an r-sized subset of [N], defining the variables in the current target. For each of these variables, we first choose a category uniformly randomly and remove it from consideration (in order to satisfy Assumption 3.1). From the remaining categories, we uniformly randomly select one for each of the variables in the target. Finally, we generate m scalar weights for the mixing coefficients such that they sum to 1. In order to make sure that these coefficients are not too small, we generate them with Dirichlet priors with all parameter values fixed to 2. The settings for number of nodes N and sample size M used in the experiment are (N, M) \u2208 {4, 8, 12} \u00d7 {2 4 , 2 5 , . . . , 2 20 } where \u00d7 is the direct product of sets.",

We also vary the number of nodes N in {4, 8, 12} and show separate plots for each N in each of the figures. The four plots in Figure 1, demonstrate four different accuracy metrics we describe in Appendix F. In Figure 1a, we plot the average recall of intervention targets as M increases. Recall for a single input instance is the number of intervention targets in the input that are identified in the output, as defined in Appendix F. Average recall is the average of this over all random instances generated in the simulation. We observe a general trend of increase in the recall as we increase the number of samples. Also, a relatively larger number of samples are required to achieve the same level of recall for mixtures generated from CBN with a large number of nodes as compared to smaller ones. This trend is expected as Algorithm 2 estimates the intervention targets by sequentially adding nodes to them. Hence for larger-sized CBNs, the error accumulated is larger as compared to smaller ones.",

For each input, RMSE is calculated using the definition supplied in Appendix F. Then it is averaged over all the random input instances. We observe a fast decrease in the average RMSE as M increases. We also observe that the average RMSE is higher for higher N. This is also expected since for distributions on larger number of variables, more samples will be needed to estimate marginal probabilities accurately.",
                "In Figure 1c, we plot average False-Positive RMSE (Section Appendix F) or FP-RMSE as M increases. For each input instance, FP-RMSE computes the RMSE in mixing proportions for components which are not present in actual target set but predicted by our algorithm. This is then averaged over all the random input instances. For each value of N, we observe a similar decreasing trend in this plot showing that incorrect targets in our output have very small mixing proportions (as sample size increases) and therefore even if they are present in the output their contribution is insignificant.",

For each input instance, FN-RMSE computes the RMSE in mixing proportions for components present in the actual target but not present in the output targets. This is then averaged over all the random input instances. Even though we observe a clear decreasing trend in this situation as well, the rate is much slower as N increases. This implies that the sample complexity of our algorithm is high and it might need too many samples to correctly identify the coefficients of targets present in the input. Reducing the sample complexity is an interesting research direction which we plan to pursue in a future work.",

We observe no significant difference in performance and make a conjecture that only high level graph parameters (such as number of nodes, edges, in-degree etc.) might be having an impact on performance and the topology (given these parameters) might not be that crucial.",

We observe that recall decreases and RMSE increases very quickly as number of nodes increase. Even though this is expected since error is accumulated as we successively add nodes and find new intervention targets, such performance for a very large sample size indicates bad dependence of sample complexity on the number of nodes. Improving this needs more exploration and is left for future work.",

But the current algorithm appears to be expensive in terms of sample complexity, especially for mixture generated from larger graphs as seen in Figures 1a,1d and Figure 2. Hence, it will be interesting to explore directions which could reduce sample complexity. We leave this for future work. Another limitation is the absence of baseline works to compare to. Since, ours is the first paper that proves identifiability of such mixtures and gives the first such algorithm, there are no prior works to compare against. In future, we plan to compare our algorithm on a related or downstream task that might have been explored in other works such as [TMCH98, SWU20, JKSB20]."

                "In this paper, we investigated the problem of identifying individual intervention targets from a mixture of interventions on a causal Bayesian Network. This problem is well motivated from the real-world scenario wherein experiments/interventions are accompanied by stochastic hidden off-target effects. We modeled this problem as a mixture of intervention distributions and constructed examples to show that, in general, it is impossible to identify all targets in it. Then, we proposed a mild positivity assumption on the underlying network and a very reasonable exclusion assumption on the intervention targets that can appear in the mixture distribution. Using these assumptions we proved that given access to the underlying CBN and the mixture distribution, there is a unique set of intervention targets that satisfies our exclusion assumption and also generates the mixture. Our uniqueness proof also provides an algorithm that uses access to the underlying distributions and efficiently identifies all the targets along with their coefficients in the mixture. In order to work with finitely many samples from the distributions, we created a small modification to our algorithm and validated it's performance using simulated experiments. We tested our algorithm and bench-marked its performance as the number of samples and nodes increased. As future work, we plan to investigate algorithms to recover targets in such mixtures using a smaller number of samples. Another interesting direction is to use limited access to the underlying CBN while recovering the targets. This can be very useful in situations where sufficient data or prior knowledge might not be available to pin down the CBN. Solving the identifiability problem when the CBN has unobserved confounders might be a good first step in this direction. a fruitful and enjoyable research experience.

Similar to the argument made in Example C.1, at least one of \u03b4 1 , \u03b4 2 will be 0 and therefore this system has a unique solution (using Lemma 4.1) giving values of \u03b4 0 , \u03b4 1 , \u03b4 2 .

P(V ) is estimated by estimating all the CPDs using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In our implementation, we use a function from the pgmpy library ( [AP15]), to compute these MLE estimates. We enforce Assumption 3.2 on P(V ), by enforcing it on all it's CPDs, using a small positive parameter \u03b4 (chosen by us).
