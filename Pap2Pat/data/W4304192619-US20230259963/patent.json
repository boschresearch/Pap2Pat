                        "Understanding the treatment effect of interventions on a desired outcome is one of the main components of prescriptive analysis in the sciences and social sciences. In some instances, known interventions are taken on a system and the effect of the interventions can be analyzed. However, there are many situations where data being analyzed contains samples that result from unintended/unknown interventions. For example, unknown interventions often occur in gene knockout techniques. These gene knockout techniques are intended to target a particular genome. However, experiments have been observed to have off target effects which create unwanted and hidden manipulations in the genome. As another example, an unknown intervention can occur in a system analyzing promotional emails when a promotional email ends up in a spam folder and therefore never reaches a targeted individual. Similarly, an automated campaign might end up sending an email with incorrect or unintended content. In such scenarios, different samples can get randomly exposed to different unknown interventions, thereby creating a mixture of interventions."

The simulation is done via the do( ) operator, wherein the CBN is altered by breaking incoming edges of the target variables and fixing them to desired target values.

However, real-world interventions are not always precise and might end up as incorrect, unknown and unintended. There are often situations where data being analyzed contains samples of many such unintended/unknown interventions.",

For each customer, the subject line is selected depending on how many emails the customer has opened in the past. Individuals who engaged more in the past get Subject_1 (with high probability) and those who engage less get Subject_2 (with high probability). Finally, at the end of the promotion duration, for each customer, information is obtained on whether the email was opened by the customer or not. The data is used to generate a CBN with three variables: \u201cPast_Opens\u201d, \u201cTreatment\u201d, and \u201cOpen\u201d. The Past_Opens variable denotes the co-variate indicating the number of emails opened by the customer in the past. The Treatment variable denotes which of the two subject lines was sent to the customer. The Open variable is the outcome and can be one of {Yes, No}. Customer data from historical campaigns (and experiments if necessary) can be used to estimate the conditional probabilities P(Open|Treatment, Past_Opens), P(Treatment|Past_Opens) and P(Past_Opens) and therefore have a complete description of the CBN.",

For instance, consider a customer who has made many opens in the past and therefore was sent an email with subject line Subject_1. However, due to a new spam filter deployed by the customer's email provider, the email gets filtered as spam and therefore never gets opened. The analytics systems has no knowledge of the spam filter, and it could be assumed that the email was not opened because the customer was not interested. In general, many such unknown interventions on different customers might be happening, making this problem quite challenging for the analytics system to resolve. Identifying which customer went through which unknown interventions could be of high value.",

However, the technology results in unintended cleavage at unknown genome sites. Moreover, the unintended intervention targets can themselves be noisy; i.e., different individuals targeted by the same intervention might undergo completely different off-target interventions. For example, some studies have demonstrated that the same gene editing experiment (using CRISPR-Cas9) on mice embryos exhibited different unintended cleavage for different mice.",

For instance, one solution employs an algorithm to learn such unintended interventions under the assumption that each unintended intervention is only on a single variable. This is a very restrictive assumption since the unintended intervention is generally not in control and could be possibly affecting multiple treatment variables. This can be seen by extending the above marketing example to have two treatment variables, the promotional email (i.e., email promotions with two possible subject line options: Subject_1 or Subject_2) and an app notification. It's possible that some customers who were affected by the unintended intervention due to the spam filter also disable notifications on their phone leading to an unintended and unknown intervention on two variables. The existing solution does not tackle this situation and only works when all unintended interventions are on a single variable.",

The mixture of interventions includes known and/or unknown interventions. As will be described in further detail herein, some configurations of the technology described herein enforces two conditions to determine interventions and their mixing coefficients (percentage of samples) in the mixture of interventions. The first condition is that a given system satisfies positivity; i.e., the probability distributions generated from samples have all positive probabilities. The second condition is that a set of intervention tuples (interventions and their corresponding mixing coefficients) satisfy exclusion; i.e. some setting of each variable is missing from the mixture. Using these two conditions, a set of intervention tuples can be determined for samples with a mixture of interventions, and the set of intervention tuples can in turn be used to match individual samples to interventions.",

Additionally, a causal graph and a set of baseline samples (i.e., samples without the unknown mixture of interventions) are received. Given the causal graph, set of baseline samples, and set of samples with interventions, a set of intervention tuples is determined, representing the mixture of interventions. Each intervention tuple in the set of intervention tuples identifies an intervention (i.e., setting of a particular variable to a particular value) and a mixing coefficient for the intervention (i.e., a percentage of the samples, from the set of samples having interventions, for which that intervention contributed to the samples).",

For instance, given a causal graph with three variables, a set of intervention tuples is initially be determined for a first variable from the causal graph and that set of intervention tuples lifted to a set of intervention tuples for the first variable and a second variable, which is then lifted to a set of intervention tuples for all three variables. The order in which the variables are selected can be based on a topological ordering of the variables in the causal graph.",

The probability distributions are estimated given the set of baseline samples and the set of samples with interventions. In some configurations, positivity is enforced by perturbing the probability distributions such that all probabilities are greater than zero. To solve the system of equations, exclusion is enforced by setting each mixing coefficient to zero one at a time to provide candidate sets of interventions tuples (i.e., a candidate set of intervention tuples for each time a mixing coefficient is set to zero). A set of intervention tuples is selected from the candidate sets of intervention tuples. For instance, an L2 norm can be computed for each candidate set of intervention tuples, and the set of intervention tuples having the lowest L2 norm is selected. In some configurations, a threshold is employed such that any mixing coefficient less than the threshold is set to zero and remaining mixing coefficients renormalized. This ensures that any intervention with a low mixing coefficient is removed from consideration.",

This can include determining, from the set of intervention tuples, the intervention that maximizes the probability that the sample resulted from the intervention. The sample can then be assigned to that intervention.",

For instance, the technology described herein can identify a mixture of interventions and assign interventions to samples for systems having any number of variables. This is in contrast to some solutions that are limited to determining inventions for a single variable. While brute force approaches are not limited to a single variable, in the case of N variables with k categories each, there are \u03a9(kN) such possible interventions and the system is over exponentially many variables, thereby making it infeasible for even very small values of N. In contrast, time complexity of the technology described herein does not have an exponential dependence on N, thereby making it more efficient. As will be described in further detail below, the approach of the technology described herein is compared to the brute force approach for a small graph (due to the reason just mentioned), demonstrating better performance of the technology described herein even with smaller graphs. For causal graphs with even moderate number of nodes, the brute force becomes intractable, while the approach of the technology described herein can operate on such graphs."

                                "By way of example for illustration purposes, FIG. 2 illustrates a causal graph 200 for an email marketing scenario in which an email marketing system sends email promotions with two possible subject line options: Subject_1 or Subject_2. For each customer, the subject line is selected depending on how many emails the customer has opened in the past. Individuals who engaged more in the past get Subject_1 (with high probability) and those who engage less get Subject_2 (with high probability). Finally, at the end of the promotion duration, for each customer, information is obtained on whether the email was opened by the customer or not. The data is used to generate the causal graph 202 with three variables: \u201cPast_Opens\u201d 202, \u201cTreatment\u201d 204, and \u201cOpen\u201d 206. The Past_Opens variable 202 denotes the co-variate indicating the number of emails opened by the customer in the past. The Treatment variable 204 denotes which of the two subject lines was sent to the customer. The Open variable 206 is the outcome and can be one of {Yes, No}. A set of baseline samples can be accessed from customer data from historical campaigns (and experiments if necessary) and used to estimate the conditional probabilities P(Open|Treatment, Past_Opens), P(Treatment|Past_Opens) and P(Past_Opens). A set of samples with interventions can be provided when a new campaign with a mix of interventions occurs (including unknown and unintended interventions). An unknown intervention could occur on any of the variables in the causal graph 200. For instance, due to a new spam filter deployed by one individuals email provider, the email gets filtered as spam and therefore never gets opened. As another example, although the number of past opens by an individual indicates the individual should receive an email with Subject_1, the system inadvertently sends an email with Subject_2. As can be understood, a system with a larger number of variables and values for each variable could experience a large number of interventions.",

This provides multiple candidate sets of intervention tuples\u2014a set for each mixing coefficient being set to zero. In some configurations, any non-zero mixing coefficient is set to zero.

For instance, using the causal graph 200 of FIG. 2, the Past_Opens variable 202 can be initially selected. The set of invention tuples determined at block 410 is for a single variable, for instance, using an approach similar to that described above with reference to the method 300 of FIG. 3. However, the process would involve marginalizing data from the set of baseline samples and the set of samples with interventions to determine estimated probability distributions. For example with reference again to the causal graph 200 of FIG. 2, estimated probability distributions can initially be determined for the Past_Opens variable 202 and used to determine the set of intervention tuples for that single variable.",

If there are additional variable(s), the process returns to block 406, at which the counter is incremented by one. Because the counter is no longer at one, the process continues from block 408 to block 412, at which the solution of the set of intervention tuples for C\u22121 variables (i.e., N variables) is lifted to a solution of a set of intervention tuples for C variables (i.e., N+1 variables). When the counter is at two, the single variable provided in block 410 is lifted for the second variable at block 412. As described hereinabove, this can include solving a system of equations using the set of intervention tuples determined for the Pt variable and probability distributions determined for the 2nd variables (which can require marginalizing the data if the total number of variables is greater than the current N+1 variables). To enforce exclusion, each mixing coefficient is set to zero one at a time, and the system of equations is solved to determine the values of the mixing coefficients. This provides multiple candidate sets of intervention tuples\u2014a set for each mixing coefficient being set to zero. In some configurations, any non-zero mixing coefficient can be set to zero. Additionally, if a threshold is employed, any mixing coefficient below the threshold can be set to zero, and the remaining coefficients above the threshold can be renormalized.

In particular, the determination of intervention tuple set with C equal to (N+1)th variable is made using the intervention tuple set found in block 412 when C was equal to N. The variable selected at each iteration can be based on the topological ordering of variables from the causal graph. As an example using the causal graph 200 of FIG. 2, after computing the set of intervention tuples for two variables (i.e., for the Past_Opens variable 202 and the Treatment variable 204), the C variables selected at block 412 would include all three variables\u2014i.e., the Past_Opens variable 202, the Treatment variable 204, and the Open variable 206. The set of intervention tuples for N+1 variables determined at block 412 for the current iteration comprises the set of intervention tuples from the previous iteration (e.g., the set of intervention tuples determined for the Past_Opens variable 202 and the Treatment variable 204). That set of intervention tuples for N variables is then lifted to a set of intervention tuples for N+1 variables. For instance, the set of intervention tuples determined for the Past_Opens variable 202 and the Treatment variable 204 would be lifted to a set of intervention tuples for the Past_Opens variable 202, the Treatment variable 204, and the Open variable 206. Once it is determined at block 414 that no additional variables remain, a final set of intervention tuples is provided, as shown at block 416.",

Basically, the errors introduced are mostly due to the algorithm that finds the intervention tuples, and the error from mapping of samples to interventions is essentially due to noise from sampling.",
                                "Comparison with brute force baseline: Note that the brute force algorithm will only work for very small number of nodes. A causal graph on 4 nodes was generated with each node having 4 categories, creating an input mixture with 16 intervention components. 10000 samples were obtained from both the actual model and the mixture, the two algorithms (i.e., the technology described herein and brute force) were applied to these samples. Since samples are being used, both the algorithms will find non-zero mixing coefficients for components and therefore to correctly identify the unknown interventions a threshold was applied to the mixing proportions. To have a fair comparison between the algorithms, the same threshold 0.001 was used. Table 1 below compares some accuracy metrics of both these algorithms. Recall is the number of interventions that were correctly identified. Precision is the fraction of correct interventions among the ones recovered. RMSE is the root mean squared error in the mixing proportions. Note that for even slightly larger graphs, the brute force will not be tractable and the algorithm of the current technology will be the only known one that is efficient.",

                                "Simulation Setup. For each simulation setting (N=number of nodes, M=number of samples), a directed acyclic graph was sampled on N nodes (each having 3 categories), from the Scale-Free (SF) model, with number of edges chosen uniformly randomly from [N, 5N]. For each graph, the CPD of each node was modeled as a multinoulli distribution with Dirichlet priors having fixed parameter \u03b1=2 for all categories. This was done to conform with positivity. This generated a causal Bayesian Network . A set  of M samples was generated using ancestral sampling on this network and used as input for an algorithm using the technology described herein. To create a mixture, an integer m was uniformly randomly chosen from the set [4,16] and used as the number of interventions in the mixture. Iterating from 1 to m was performed to build each intervention target of the mixture. First, the size of the target was chosen by picking an integer r uniformly randomly from the set {0, . . . , N}. Then, an r-sized subset of [N] was uniformly randomly chosen, defining variables in the target. For each of these variables, a category was uniformly randomly chosen and removed from consideration (to satisfy exclusion). From the remaining categories, one was uniformly randomly selected for each variable in the target and used to define the intervention. Finally, m scalar weights were generated for mixing coefficients such that they sum to 1. To make sure that these mixing coefficients are not too small, there were generated with Dirichlet priors with all parameter values fixed to 2. A set mix containing M samples was generated from this mixture model and used as input for the algorithm. Parameters \u2208, \u03b4 used by the algorithm were set to 0.01 and 1/M respectively. The settings for N and M used in the experiments were (N, M)\u2208{4,8,12}\u00d7{24, 25, . . . , 220} where \u00d7 is the direct product of sets.",

The number of nodes N was also varied in {4,8,12} and separate plots are shown for each N in each of the figures. The four plots in FIGS. 6A-6D, demonstrate four different accuracy metrics described above. In FIG. 6A, the average recall of intervention targets is plotted as M increases. Recall for a single input instance is the number of intervention targets in the input that are identified in the output. Average recall is the average of this over all random instances generated in the simulation. A general trend of increase in the recall is observed as the number of samples is increased. Also, a relatively larger number of samples were required to achieve the same level of recall for mixtures generated from CBN with a large number of nodes as compared to smaller ones. This trend is expected as the algorithm estimates the interventions by sequentially adding nodes to them. Hence, for larger-sized CBNs, the error accumulated is larger as compared to smaller ones.",

For each input, RMSE was calculated using the definition supplied above. Then it was averaged over all the random input instances. A fast decrease in the average RMSE was observed as M increases. It was also observed that the average RMSE is higher for higher N. This is also expected since for distributions on larger number of variables, more samples will be needed to estimate marginal probabilities accurately.",
                                "In FIG. 6C, average False-Positive RMSE or FP-RMSE is plotted as M increases. For each input instance, FP-RMSE computes the RMSE in mixing proportions for components which are not present in actual target set but predicted by our algorithm. This was then averaged over all the random input instances. For each value of N, a similar decreasing trend in this plot was observed showing that incorrect targets in the output have very small mixing proportions (as sample size increases) and therefore even if they are present in the output their contribution is insignificant.",
                                "In FIG. 6D, average False-Negative RMSE or FN-RMSE is plotted as M increases. For each input instance, FN-RMSE computes the RMSE in mixing proportions for components present in the actual target but not present in the output targets. This was then averaged over all the random input instances. Even though a decreasing trend was observed in this situation as well, the rate is much slower as N increases. This implies that the sample complexity of the algorithm is high and it might need too many samples to correctly identify the coefficients of interventions present in the input.",
                                "FIGS. 7A-7B demonstrate and compare performance of the technology described herein as M, N increase, for CBNs generated using different random graph models (Scale-Free and Erdos-Renyi). No significant difference in performance was observed suggesting that only high level graph parameters (such as number of nodes, edges, in-degree etc.) can be having an impact on performance and the topology (given these parameters) might not be that crucial.",
                                "To further understand the performance of the technology described herein with respect to the number of nodes, in FIGS. 8A-8B, the Average Recall and Average RMSE are plotted as number of nodes varies from 4 to 32, for a fixed sample size of \u02dc106. It is observed that recall decreases and RMSE increases very quickly as number of nodes increase. Even though this is expected since error is accumulated as nodes are successively added and new interventions found, such performance for a very large sample size indicates dependence of sample complexity on the number of nodes."
