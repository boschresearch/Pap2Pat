                        "There are challenges to using such methods, however, and these methods do not work well when the amount of sample is small or when the sample contains degraded RNA.",
                        "A particular challenge is that current clinical pathology sample collection and processing procedures focus on formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) and fresh/fresh-frozen tissues rarely are available for molecular analysis. FFPE samples are difficult to work with because they yield RNA that 1) often contains PCR-interfering substances, and 2) is uniformly highly fragmented and often in low abundance. Economic factors prevent changing this workflow to ensure collection of samples in a form more conducive to molecular genetic analysis, such as fresh-frozen, therefore, there is a need to develop methods that are sufficiently robust to reliably conduct molecular genetic analysis in FFPE samples. These RT-qPCR tests must be able to assess FFPE samples with quality control and inter-laboratory reproducibility."

In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid can serve as a template for synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid, e.g., by base-complementary incorporation of nucleotide units. For example, a nucleic acid can comprise naturally occurring DNA, e.g., genomic DNA; RNA, e.g., mRNA, and/or can comprise a synthetic molecule, including but not limited to cDNA and recombinant molecules generated in any manner.

                        "The term \u201cfluorometric hydrolysis probe\u201d generally refers to a fluorescently labeled probe that takes advantage of the 5\u2032-nuclease activity present in the thermostable Taq polymerase enzyme typically used in the PCR reaction. The hydrolysis probe may be labeled with a fluorescent detector dye such as FAM or Quasar 670, and an acceptor dye or quencher. In general, the fluorescent dye is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of the probe and the quencher is attached to the 3\u2032 end of the probe, and when the probe is intact, the fluorescence of the detector dye is quenched by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The probe anneals downstream of one of the primers that defines one end of the target nucleic acid in a PCR reaction. Using the polymerase activity of the Taq enzyme, amplification of the target nucleic acid is directed by one primer that is upstream of the probe and a second primer that is downstream of the probe but anneals to the opposite strand of the target nucleic acid. As the upstream primer is extended, the Taq polymerase reaches the region where the labeled probe is annealed, recognizes the probe-template hybrid as a substrate, and hydrolyzes phosphodiester bonds of the probe. The hydrolysis reaction irrevocably releases the quenching effect of the quencher dye on the reporter dye, thus resulting in increasing detector fluorescence with each successive PCR cycle.",

                        "Design of Probes and IS Templates: For each gene target, after native template (NT) primers with sufficient efficiency and specificity were identified, real-time PCR assays using fluorometric hydrolysis probes were developed. First, a probe for the NT was designed followed by the design of an IS probe for the same DNA region but with 4-6 base pair alterations from the NT probe sequence. An IS template with corresponding alterations was synthesized as described in the synthesis and purification of standards section below. Use of multiple base changes in the IS probe ensured specificity of NT probe (FAM labeled) for the NT and IS probe (Quasar 670 labeled) for the IS. Probes with a fluorescent label at the 5\u2032 end and a Black Hole Quencher at the 3\u2032 end (BHQplus, Biosearch Technologies, Novato, Calif.) were designed using real-time design software from Biosearch Technologies (FIG. 1A, Table 1).",

The products of such syntheses are single-stranded and contain a significant fraction of incompletely synthesized (less than full-length) molecules. Thus, each synthesized NT or IS was PCR-amplified with GSP to generate completely synthesized, double-stranded nucleic acid templates. This was followed by electrophoretic separation of the PCR products on agarose gel, selection of the correct size band, and purification from agarose using QIAX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.)

For each probe, at each NT or IS dilution, the signal (Cq value: quantification cycle) observed with amplification in the presence of the non-homologous template was compared to Cq value observed with amplification in the presence of the homologous template. The non-specific binding rate was calculated using 2(\u2212delta Cq) (delta Cq=non-homologous template Cq\u2212homologous template Cq) at each dilution. If, at any concentration, the number of input non-homologous molecules detected by the probe was more than 10% of the number of homologous molecules detected, then the probe was re-designed.",

Each of these two ESM concentrations was measured in each experiment and for each gene the average measured Cq difference [NT Cq\u2212IS Cq] from the two ESM was used to correct the [NT Cq\u2212IS Cq] value measured in each unknown sample (Table 3, FIG. 2).",

Specifically, the stock ISM solution was serially diluted to a concentration expected to contain 40, 20, 10, 7, 4, 2, 1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.1 molecules of each IS in each microliter. The expected frequency of reactions with detectable PCR product at each dilution was tested with real time PCR using the pre-amplification method to increase the signal to background ratio (See the above section: Pre-amplification (1st round PCR) and second-round PCR). As an example, when 1 \u03bcl of the dilution expected to contain 0.7 molecules per microliter solution was included in the PCR, the expected frequency of positive reactions was 50.3% by Poisson analysis. The nine replicate samples of each dilution for each gene (ACTB, MYC, E2F1, CDKN1A) were measured.

As the labeled probe concentration decreased in the reaction, the Cq increased (FIGS. 11A and 11C). However, this potential source of analytical variation was controlled by correcting the measured lung sample [NT Cq\u2212IS Cq] values relative to the ESM [NT Cq\u2212IS Cq] values (FIGS. 11B and 11D). The ESM contained a known 1:1 concentration of each NT and IS that was constant among experiments, therefore any variation in the observed ESM [NT Cq\u2212IS Cq] relative to the expected value of 0 was attributable to variation in experimental conditions, including fluorescence intensity.",

Thus, whether the threshold was selected through the automatic method or the manual method, there was day-to-day variation in the selected Cq threshold setting. However, because the inter-experimental variation in the Cq threshold had the same effect on sample Cq and ESM Cq, inter-experimental variation in sample Cq was controlled by ESM Cq as described above. For example, MYC/106 ACTB was measured in FFPE sample SM8 cDNA in seven PCR replicates on five different days and the Cq threshold value automatically selected in each PCR was different (FIG. 11E) resulting in high CV of 0.99 (Table 4).

Key to the elimination of inter-experimental variation when measuring multiple genes was use of the same ISM comprising a known concentration of IS for each of the genes to be measured.

Such products are readily quantified using real-time PCR. Competitive PCR analysis involves simultaneous quantification of each target gene NT and its respective IS. To do this by real-time PCR requires inclusion of two different sequence-specific probes in the same PCR reaction, each with a different fluor. Calculating each NT analyte relative to its respective IS requires an additional measurement, and, in some studies, this may be associated with a tendency to increase imprecision. However, the imprecision observed in the results described herein was less than 10% except for the measurement of very low copy numbers (<60 copies), at which point imprecision is determined largely by the natural law governing stochastic sampling variation rather than method-specific characteristics.",

In contrast, using pre-amplified and 1000-fold diluted samples, the Cq for each NT and IS after a second round of PCR ranged from 11-26. The amount of dilution of first round amplification product can be reduced if necessary to ensure sufficient signal in the second round for very low input of sample cDNA.
