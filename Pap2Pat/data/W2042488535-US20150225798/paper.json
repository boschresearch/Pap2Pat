    "title": "A Multiplex Two-Color Real-Time PCR Method for Quality-Controlled Molecular Diagnostic Testing of FFPE Samples",
    "date": "2014-02-21",
    "abstract": "Background Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) tests support personalized cancer treatment through more clinically meaningful diagnosis. However, samples obtained through standard clinical pathology procedures are formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and yield small samples with low integrity RNA containing PCR interfering substances. RT-qPCR tests able to assess FFPE samples with quality control and inter-laboratory reproducibility are needed. Methods We developed an RT-qPCR method by which 1) each gene was measured relative to a known number of its respective competitive internal standard molecules to control for interfering substances, 2) two-color fluorometric hydrolysis probes enabled analysis on a real-time platform, 3) external standards controlled for variation in probe fluorescence intensity, and 4) pre-amplification maximized signal from FFPE RNA samples. Reagents were developed for four genes comprised by a previously reported lung cancer diagnostic test (LCDT) then subjected to analytical validation using synthetic native templates as test articles to assess linearity, signal-to-analyte response, lower detection threshold, imprecision and accuracy. Fitness of this method and these reagents for clinical testing was assessed in FFPE normal (N = 10) and malignant (N = 10) lung samples. Results Reagents for each of four genes, MYC, E2F1, CDKN1A and ACTB comprised by the LCDT had acceptable linearity (R2>0.99), signal-to-analyte response (slope 1.0\u00b10.05), lower detection threshold (<10 molecules) and imprecision (CV <20%). Poisson analysis confirmed accuracy of internal standard concentrations. Internal standards controlled for experimentally introduced interference, prevented false-negatives and enabled pre-amplification to increase signal without altering measured values. In the fitness for purpose testing of this two-color fluorometric LCDT using surgical FFPE samples, the diagnostic accuracy was 93% which was similar to that previously reported for analysis of fresh samples. Conclusions This quality-controlled two-color fluorometric RT-qPCR approach will facilitate the development of reliable, robust RT-qPCR-based molecular diagnostic tests in FFPE clinical samples.",

                "Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests that measure transcript abundance of selected genes in clinical specimens have been demonstrated to increase cancer diagnostic accuracy and enable \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d through selection of the most effective treatment for each cancer [1]\u2013[3]. However, a key challenge is that current clinical pathology sample collection and processing procedures focus on formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) and fresh/fresh-frozen tissues rarely are available for molecular analysis. FFPE samples are difficult to work with because they yield RNA that 1) often contains PCR-interfering substances, and 2) is uniformly highly fragmented and often in low abundance [4]\u2013[8]. Economic factors prevent changing this workflow to ensure collection of samples in a form more conducive to molecular genetic analysis, such as fresh frozen, therefore, there is a need to develop methods that are sufficiently robust to reliably conduct molecular genetic analysis in FFPE samples.",
                "One way to address the challenge of interfering substances is to incorporate quality control in qPCR through measurement of each analyte relative to a known number of competitive template internal standard (IS) copies. This quality control method is recommended by regulatory agencies, including the EPA [9], ISO [10], and FDA [11], and is implemented in many FDA-approved single analyte RT-qPCR tests [12]\u2013[14].",
                "Multiple gene RT-qPCR tests present an even more complex quality control challenge that can be addressed by combining the IS for each of the genes into an internal standards mixture (ISM) and using an aliquot of this ISM in each experiment, as previously described [15]\u2013[17]. Each target gene and loading control gene then is measured relative to a known number of its respective competitive template IS molecules in each PCR reaction [18], [19].",
                "To address the challenge of analyzing clinical samples that yield a low amount of RNA, we previously described a competitive multiplex PCR method, in which all reference and target genes are first co-amplified with ISM in a first round of PCR, followed by amplification of individual gene in the second round [20]. This approach enables reliable measurement of many genes from the amount of RNA that, without pre-amplification, would be sufficient for measurement of only a single gene.",
                "The primary goal of this study was to develop a robust RT-qPCR method for more reliable molecular diagnostic testing of FFPE samples including those stored in existing large archives. To meet this need, a method was designed with four elements: 1) Synthetic competitive IS formulated into an ISM to control for sub-optimal PCR, including interference with PCR caused by substances present in FFPE samples [21]\u2013[23], sub-optimal quantity or quality of PCR reaction reagents, and inter-well and/or inter-platform variation in PCR conditions; 2) Fluorometric hydrolysis probe real-time PCR to enable quantification of short PCR amplicons (60\u201380 base pairs) that are optimal for reliable analysis of FFPE samples; 3) An external standards mixture (ESM) in each experiment to control for inter-lot and inter-experimental variation in probe fluorescence intensity; and 4) Reverse transcription with gene specific primers (GSP) followed by competitive multiplex pre-amplification to enable measurement of lowly expressed genes in pauci-cellular samples with degraded and limited amounts of RNA.",
                "To validate this approach, we developed reagents for measurement of previously reported lung cancer diagnostic test (LCDT) comprising v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) genes measured relative to actin, beta (ACTB) [24]. These reagents were subjected to analytical validation using synthetic templates as test articles and fitness for the purpose of testing using surgical benign and malignant FFPE samples according to recommended practices [25]."

As the labeled probe concentration decreased in the reaction, the Cq increased (Figure 5A, C). However, this potential source of analytical variation was controlled by correcting the measured lung sample [NT Cq - IS Cq] values relative to the ESM [NT Cq - IS Cq] values (Figure 5B, D).

Thus, whether the threshold was selected through the automatic method or the manual method, there was day-to-day variation in the selected Cq threshold setting. However, because the inter-experimental variation in the Cq threshold had the same effect on sample Cq and ESM Cq, inter-experimental variation in sample Cq was controlled by ESM Cq as described in the previous paragraph. For example, MYC/106 ACTB was measured in FFPE sample SM8 cDNA in seven PCR replicates on five different days and the Cq threshold value automatically selected in each PCR was different (Figure 5E) resulting in high CV of 0.99.

To do this by real-time PCR requires inclusion of two different sequence-specific probes in the same PCR reaction, each with a different fluor [12], [13], [35]. Calculating each NT analyte relative to its respective IS requires an additional measurement, and, in some studies, this may be associated with a tendency to increased imprecision [36].

Thus, in this study involving only three target genes and a single reference gene, cDNA consumption was reduced four-fold.

In contrast, using pre-amplified and 1000-fold diluted samples, the Cq for each NT and IS after a second round of PCR ranged from 11\u201326. The amount of dilution of first round amplification product can be reduced if necessary to ensure sufficient signal in the second round for very low input of sample cDNA.
