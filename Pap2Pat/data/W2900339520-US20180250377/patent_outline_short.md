# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- introduce Bacillus spore delivery system

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe Bacillus biology and limitations of current vaccine delivery systems

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce BEAD system for delivering therapeutic compositions
- describe fusion construct and its insertion into exosporium
- outline methods of making and using BEAD system
- summarize kits and methods of using BEAD system

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce Bacillus exosporium antigen delivery (BEAD) system
- identify domains important in protein incorporation into exosporium
- describe process of assembly and attachment of BclA and BclB
- exploit targeting domains as BEAD system

### Exploitation of the Targeting Domains as a Bacillus Exosporium Antigen Delivery (BEAD) System

- describe use of BEAD system for high expression of foreign proteins
- discuss implications of BEAD system for vaccine development

### Examples

- introduce experimental procedures
- describe creation of fusion constructs
- outline spore analysis by flow cytometry
- present micrograph images
- detail transmission electron microscopy
- provide example 1: BclA protein contains N-terminal exosporium targeting domain
- provide examples 2 and 3: N-terminal amino acids required for exosporium incorporation and cleavage of N-terminal domain associates with incorporation of
- introduce reporter fusions
- demonstrate exosporium incorporation
- analyze reporter oligomerization
- investigate conserved motif and N-terminal sequences
- study BclB N-terminal domain
- examine native BclA incorporation
- analyze fusion protein incorporation
- demonstrate BEAD system
