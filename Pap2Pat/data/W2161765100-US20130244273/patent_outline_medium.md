# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- define autism spectrum disorders
- describe prevalence of autism
- discuss limitations of current diagnosis
- motivate genetic contribution to autism
- summarize twin studies
- discuss chromosomal abnormalities
- highlight need for laboratory test

## SUMMARY

- disclose method for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder

## DEFINITIONS

- define autism and autism spectrum disorders
- define terms related to tryptophan metabolism

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce ASD diagnosis methods
- motivate tryptophan metabolism analysis
- describe kynurenine pathway
- explain tryptophan's role in serotonin and melatonin production
- discuss mitochondrial dysfunction in ASDs
- relate mitochondrial dysfunction to synaptic abnormalities
- describe the role of serotonin in brain development and function
- discuss the potential link between tryptophan metabolism and ASDs
- outline the method for determining tryptophan metabolism ability
- describe cell culture preparation and maintenance
- explain the use of starvation media with tryptophan as energy source
- discuss the importance of culture time and cell sample size
- describe the detection of markers indicating tryptophan metabolism
- explain the use of NAD as a biomarker
- discuss the detection methods for biomarkers
- describe the use of detectable labels and conjugated probes
- outline the binding of probes to substrates
- explain the determination of marker presence or amount
- provide example results of metabolic profile analysis
- summarize the significance of the results

### Example 1

- describe experimental setup
- detail incubation and measurement procedures
- outline statistical analysis methods
- present results of NADH production in autistic samples
- discuss expression analysis of tryptophan-related genes
- analyze results in context of tryptophan metabolism
- test specificity of protocol with syndromal autism and other conditions
- summarize conclusions from experimental results

### Example 2

- test patients with autistic disorders and controls using PM-M4 plate

### Example 3

- analyze samples from ASDs patients and controls using PM-M4 plates

### Example 4

- employ machine learning methods to determine informative substrates
- design customized 96-well plate and test lymphoblastoid cell lines

### Example 5

- test blood samples from ASDs patients and controls for NADH production
