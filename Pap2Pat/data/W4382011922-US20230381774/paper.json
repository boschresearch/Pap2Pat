    "title": "Reduction of Intracellular Tension and Cell Adhesion Promotes Open Chromatin Structure and Enhances Cell Reprogramming",
    "date": "2023-06-26",
    "abstract": "The role of transcription factors and biomolecules in cell type conversion has been widely studied. Yet, it remains unclear whether and how intracellular mechanotransduction through focal adhesions (FAs) and the cytoskeleton regulates the epigenetic state and cell reprogramming. Here, it is shown that cytoskeletal structures and the mechanical properties of cells are modulated during the early phase of induced neuronal (iN) reprogramming, with an increase in actin cytoskeleton assembly induced by Ascl1 transgene. The reduction of actin cytoskeletal tension or cell adhesion at the early phase of reprogramming suppresses the expression of mesenchymal genes, promotes a more open chromatin structure, and significantly enhances the efficiency of iN conversion. Specifically, reduction of intracellular tension or cell adhesion not only modulates global epigenetic marks, but also decreases DNA methylation and heterochromatin marks and increases euchromatin marks at the promoter of neuronal genes, thus enhancing the accessibility for gene activation. Finally, micro\u2010 and nano\u2010topographic surfaces that reduce cell adhesions enhance iN reprogramming. These novel findings suggest that the actin cytoskeleton and FAs play an important role in epigenetic regulation for cell fate determination, which may lead to novel engineering approaches for cell reprogramming.",

                "Cell reprogramming enables the derivation of distinct cell types that are highly valuable for regenerative cell therapy, disease modeling and therapeutic discovery. [1,2] Direct cell conversion provides a faster and more direct method of generating desired cell types from somatic cells. [3,4] Previous studies have demonstrated that fibroblasts can be directly converted into other cell types such as neurons, [5,6] and cardiomyocytes [7] by using transcription factors, microRNAs and biophysical factors. [8][9][10][11] However, low conversion efficiency has limited the translation of direct reprogramming strategies for therapeutic purposes. In addition, the role of mechanotransduction through intracellular structures such as actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions (FAs) during direct reprogramming is poorly understood.",
                "Increasing evidence indicates that FAs and the cytoskeleton play important roles in sensing and transducing extracellular transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors encoding three key reprogramming factors, Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l (BAM), and seeded onto tissue culture polystyrene dishes coated with laminin the following day. As illustrated in Figure 1A, Dox was added one day later (marked as day 0) to initiate the expression of the transgenes and cells were cultured in neuronal medium (i.e., N3 medium) from day 1 to the conclusion of the experiment. To gain insights into the morphological changes that fibroblasts undergo as they reprogram into neurons, we first examined how the actin cytoskeleton was altered during the early phase of iN reprogramming. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that by day 1 of the reprogramming process, actin assembled into a network with a cage-like structure around the nucleus, but this structure along with the majority of the cytoskeleton gradually disappeared by day 3 (Figure 1B). To determine whether these structural changes resulted in differences in the mechanical phenotype of cells, the mechanical properties of BAM-transduced fibroblasts was measured at similar time points using high-throughput quantitative deformability cytometry (q-DC), in which the timescale of a cell to transit through a narrow constriction provides a metric for cell deformability. We found that cell transit time and stiffness increased by day 1 and was followed by a decrease on day 3, which coincided with the observed cytoskeletal changes (Figure 1C,D and Figures S1 andS2, Supporting Information). Utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure cell stiffness yielded a similar trend, consistent with our q-DC findings, and demonstrated more profound differences in cell stiffness across the various time points (Figure 1E). These changes in cellular mechanical properties were transgene-specific as transduction with green fluorescent protein (GFP) did not produce a similar effect (Figure 1E). These results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton and mechanical properties of cells are modulated during the early phase of reprogramming, possibly playing a role in iN conversion."

                        "Next, we sought to determine the transgene that was responsible for the observed changes in the cytoskeleton and mechanical phenotype by reprogramming fibroblasts with individual or various combinations of the transgenes. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of cytoskeletal structures and FA proteins demonstrated that Ascl1 promoted the actin cage-like structure and paxillin expression at day 1 (Figure 2A and Figure S3, Supporting Information). Although less intact stress fibers were observed at day 3, paxillin expression remained high (Figure 2A and Figure S3, Supporting Information). On the other hand, the presence of paxillin-positive punctate and cell spreading appeared to decrease in BM-and BAM-transduced fibroblasts (Figure 2A). Interestingly, AFM analysis revealed that Ascl1 was the critical transgene in modulating the mechanical phenotype of cells in the early phase of reprogramming as it induced changes in cell stiffness in a manner comparable to BAM (Figure 2B). To elucidate whether these observations could extend to the transcript level, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of non-transduced and Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts on day 3. We found that the overexpression of Ascl1 led to the over-representation of genes in Gene Ontology (GO) categories related to the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, such as actin cytoskeleton organization and actinmediated cell contraction (Figure 2C and Figures S4 andS5, Supporting Information). Altogether, these results suggested that the increase in cytoskeleton assembly at the early phase of reprogramming could be attributed to Ascl1-induced expression of cytoskeletal proteins."

                        "To examine whether these changes in cell stiffness, actin structure, and expression of contractility-mediating genes were involved in iN reprogramming, we evaluated the effects of disrupting the cytoskeleton using small molecule inhibitors. For these experiments, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were reprogrammed as in Figure 1A and chemical compounds known to perturb the cytoskeleton were added to the culture medium on day 1 to evaluate their effects on the reprogramming process. After 2 weeks, cultures were fixed and immunostained for neuronal \ud835\udefd-III tubulin (TUBB3). iN cells were identified based on displays of a typical neuronal morphology (defined as cells with a circular soma extending processes that are at least three times the length of the cell body) and positive TUBB3 expression. The reprogramming efficiency was determined as the percentage of TUBB3 + -iN cells normalized to the number of cells plated at 24 h post-seeding (i.e., day 0). First, we tested whether disruption of cytoskeletal contractility could influence the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into neurons using blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin II inhibitor. [24][25][26] We observed that iN cells could be derived in the absence and presence of blebbistatin (Figure 3A). Interestingly, when fibroblasts were induced to reprogram in the presence of varying concentrations of blebbistatin, we observed a biphasic dose response, suggesting that a reduction in intracellular tension may promote iN conversion (Figure 3B). In particular, treatment with 10 \u03bcm blebbistatin generated the highest number of iN cells and increased the reprogramming efficiency by \u22484.5-fold compared to the control, therefore, this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments. This enhanced reprogramming efficiency by blebbistatin was also confirmed by using mouse fibroblasts isolated from Tau-EGFP mice, whereby cells expressing the neuronal marker, Tau, are concomitantly labeled with GFP (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYH9) and IIB (MYH10) in BAM-transduced fibroblasts promoted the reprogramming efficiency, recapitulating the small molecule inhibitor results, although to a lesser degree, and suggesting that a reduction in non-muscle myosin II may be responsible for the observed increase in the reprogramming efficiency (Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information). As Ascl1 has been identified as a pioneer factor for iN reprogramming and transduction of Ascl1 alone is sufficient to generate iN cells, [27,28] we further investigated whether blebbistatin could influence iN conversion by Ascl1 induction. Remarkably, we found that blebbistatin treatment could generate significantly more iN cells from Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts relative to control (Figure 3C), suggesting that inhibition of cell contractility could promote singlefactor reprogramming.",
                        "To determine whether cytoskeletal disruption modulated intracellular tension, we used AFM to measure cell stiffness as an indicator of intracellular tension. [29,30] We found a decrease in cytoskeletal and nuclear stiffness after blebbistatin treatment, suggesting that inhibition of cytoskeletal contractility indeed decreased intracellular tension (Figure S9, Supporting Information). To determine whether interference of other cytoskeletal structures affected iN reprogramming, we examined the effects of other chemical inhibitors on actin cytoskeleton and reprogramming, including Y-27632 (a Rho-kinase inhibitor to prevent stress fiber formation and contraction), [31] nocodazole (disrupting the assembly and disassembly dynamics of microtubules), [32] jasplakinolide (stabilizing actin filaments), [12] and cytochalasin D (inhibiting F-actin polymerization). Consistently, inhibition Rho-kinase decreased intracellular tension (Figure S9, Supporting Information), decreased cell spreading (Figure S10, Supporting Information), and increased the yield of iN cells similar to blebbistatin, although to a lesser degree (Figure 3D); in contrast, treatment with nocodazole, which compromised cell division and other functions and increased stress fibers (Figure S10, Supporting Information), resulted in a reduction in the reprogramming efficiency (Figure 3E). Moreover, treatment with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D reduced the reprogramming efficiency relative to control (Figure 3F and Figure S10, Supporting Information), suggesting that maintaining a certain level of actin cytoskeleton might be required for iN reprogramming.",
                        "Next, we determined the minimum length of time necessary for the inhibitor to elicit an effect by reprogramming fibroblasts in the absence and presence of blebbistatin over timescales of 1 to 14 days. Surprisingly, we found that administering blebbistatin for the first 3 days was sufficient to enhance the reprogramming efficiency, suggesting that relaxation of intracellular tension might facilitate initiation of the reprogramming process (Figure S11, Supporting Information). Indeed, treatment with blebbistatin during distinct phases, that is, early (days 1-5), mid (day 5-9), and late (day 9-13) stages of reprogramming, demonstrated that the effects of cytoskeletal disruption were most crucial during the early phase of reprogramming (Figure 3G). Additionally, time course studies of the reprogramming process revealed that as early as day 5, blebbistatin treatment led to more efficient generation of TUBB3 + iN cells than the control, and this trend was evident throughout a longer time period (Figures S12 andS13, Supporting Information).",

                        "To determine whether the reduction of cytoskeletal tension at the early stage of reprogramming adversely affected neuronal properties, we assessed the maturation and functionality of the iN cells derived in the absence and presence of blebbistatin. Immunostaining analysis for mature neuronal markers revealed that iN cells expressed NeuN, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and synapsin (Figure 3H). Similar observations were found in Tau-EGFP-derived iN cells (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Electrophysiological analysis indicated that the iN cells were functional, exhibiting spontaneous changes in membrane potential in response to current injection (Figure 3I). Further analysis of several action potential properties showed no apparent difference for iN cells generated in the absence and presence of blebbistatin (Figure S15A-D, Supporting Information). In addition, there was no significant difference in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), but the EPSC amplitude was 12% higher in iN cells derived with blebbistatin (Figure S15E-G, Supporting Information). Similarly, we observed no significant difference in spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs) frequency, although the amplitude of IPSC was 4% lower in blebbistatin-derived iN cells (Figure S15H-J, Supporting Information). Furthermore, iN cells were found to be of the GABAergic and glutamatergic subtypes, in agreement with a previous report [5] (Figure S16, Supporting Information). Collectively, these results suggest that blebbistatin treatment did not affect the maturation and general functions of iN cells except for a slight (4-12%) effect on the amplitude of EP-SCs and IPSCs."

We observed that blebbistatin induced dramatic changes in cell morphology and reduced cell spreading in fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin for 24 h (Figure 4A). In addition, there appeared to be fewer intact actin fibers in fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin. Upon observing that cell spreading was affected, immunostaining analysis of FA proteins showed there were fewer positive paxillin punctate in blebbistatin-treated cells, suggesting that cytoskeletal disruption may modulate FA assembly and, as a result, cell adhesion (Figure 4A).",
                        "It has been proposed that cell reprogramming involves the suppression of the original cell phenotype and the activation of the target cell fate regulatory program. [33] Thus, we investigated whether blebbistatin's mechanism of action involved the repression of the mesenchymal phenotype in fibroblasts. To test this, non-transduced fibroblasts were cultured with and without blebbistatin for 24 or 48 h, respectively, followed by analysis of mesenchymal marker expression. Interestingly, we observed less calponin and \ud835\udefc-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive cells after blebbistatin treatment and that the expression for both markers had decreased at the gene and protein level by day 3 (Figure 4B-D). Similarly, this trend was evident in BAM-transduced fibroblasts (Figure 4C,D). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis also showed that blebbistatin downregulated the expression of other mesenchymal and fibroblastassociated genes, ELN and DCN, in non-and BAM-transduced fibroblasts (Figure S17, Supporting Information).",
                        "Subsequently, we explored the effect of cytoskeletal disruption on the induction of the neuronal phenotype by performing qRT-PCR analysis to evaluate neuronal gene expression at day 5. We found that the expression of various neuronal genes, including the key reprogramming factors, were significantly increased in BAM-transduced fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin, as compared to the non-treated transduced cells (Figure 4E). It is important to note that, in the absence of BAM transgenes, blebbistatin was not sufficient to induce endogenous neuronal genes in the fibroblasts (Figure 4E), implicating that blebbistatin either directly enhanced transgenes or modulated the epigenetic state during reprogramming. To determine whether blebbistatin influenced the expression of the transgenes at an earlier time point, we analyzed the expression of BAM at day 3. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Ascl1 expression was upregulated by blebbistatin at day 3 (Figure S18, Supporting Information). On the contrary, Brn2 and Myt1l did not show such a drastic increase in the expression level, suggesting that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension may enhance iN conversion efficiency by modulating Ascl1 expression at this early time point. Considering two additional transcription factors along with Ascl1 are included in the reprogramming cocktail to generate iN cells, we questioned if perhaps blebbistatin could induce the expression of Brn2 and Myt1l to promote single factor reprogramming. Utilizing qRT-PCR to analyze the changes in neuronal gene expression in Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts, we found that blebbistatin upregulated the expression of endogenous Brn2 and Myt1l at day 7 (Figure S19, Supporting Information). Moreover, the expression of several neuronal genes, including the master neuronal gene, NeuroD1, was also higher in Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin (Figure S19, Supporting Information).",
                        "To determine the effect of reducing cytoskeletal tension on gene expression at the single-cell level, we performed 10x single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on samples of BAMtransduced fibroblasts reprogrammed in the absence or presence of blebbistatin on day 3. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot analysis identified 9 cell clusters based For experiments in (A) and (B), fibroblasts were transduced with individual or various combinations of the transgenes and collected at the indicated time points for immunofluorescence analysis or AFM measurements, where non-transduced (NT) fibroblasts served as a control. A) Representative immunofluorescent images show the actin network (phalloidin, red), focal adhesions (paxillin, green) and nucleus (DAPI, blue) in fibroblasts transduced with individual or various combinations of the transgenes at the indicated time points.

Box plots show the ends at the quartiles, the median as a horizontal line in the box, the mean as a (+) symbol, and the whiskers extend from the minimum to maximum data point (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). on gene expression profile, which were comparable between DMSO-and blebbistatin-treated cells (Figure 4F and Figures S20 and S21, Supporting Information). Further analysis revealed that blebbistatin treatment differentially regulated gene expression, in particular, promoting the expression of genes related to axonogenesis and synapse organization/regulation (Figure 4G and Figures S22 andS23, Supporting Information). Additionally, we found an increase in the percentage of cells expressing neuronal genes, including TUBB3 and MAPT, after blebbistatin treatment, which is in agreement with our reprogramming efficiency findings and further suggests that a reduction in cytoskeletal tension can promote iN reprogramming (Figure 4H and Figure S24, Supporting Information). Further GO term analysis showed that blebbistatin induced the downregulation of mitosisrelated and heterochromatin-related genes when compared to the DMSO condition (Figure 4I,J). Utilizing Monocle 3 to construct a single cell trajectory based on gene expression, we found that blebbistatin-derived iN cells follow a similar reprogramming trajectory as those derived in the absence of blebbistatin (Figure S25, Supporting Information). In short, the reduction of intracellular tension may promote BAM-induced iN reprogramming by globally upregulating numerous neuronal genes at the single cell level."

                        "A critical step of cell reprogramming is to overcome the epigenetic barrier. We postulated that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension might alter the epigenetic state to promote iN conversion. Consistently, scRNA-seq showed that blebbistatin downregulated the expression of heterochromatin genes (Figure 4J). Therefore, to determine the effect of cytoskeletal modulation on global chromatin organization, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of histone marks associated with open chromatin structure (i.e., histone H3 acetylation [AcH3], tri-methylated histone H3 on lysine 4 [H3K4me3], and monomethylated histone H3 on lysine 4 [H3K4me1]) and indicative of heterochromatin (i.e., tri-methylated histone H3 on lysine 27 [H3K27me3] and tri-methylated histone H3 on lysine 9 [H3K9me3]) in non-transduced fibroblasts cultured with and without blebbistatin. As shown in Figure 5A and Figure S26, Supporting Information, interestingly, blebbistatin-treated cells exhibited an increase in AcH3, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1 marks while heterochromatin marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 decreased, compared to control, suggesting that inhibition of cytoskeletal contractility can induce global epigenetic changes and furthermore, may promote a more open chromatin structure. Similar histone trends were observed in fibroblasts treated with the Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) but no other cytoskeletal disrupting compounds (i.e., nocodazole, cytochalasin D, and jasplakinolide), suggesting that these histone changes might be attributed to changes in cytoskeletal tension (Figures S27 and S28, Supporting Information).",
                        "Analysis of chromatin-modifying enzyme activity showed that blebbistatin treatment increased histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity while reducing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (Figure 5B,C), which could potentially lead to an increase in histone H3 acetylation and thus, gene activation. In addition, blebbistatin treatment increased the activity of H3K4-specific histone methyltransferase (HMT) and reduced histone demethylase (HDM) activity, thereby possibly promoting H3K4 methylation (Figure 5D,E).",
                        "To directly determine whether intracellular tension reduction could alter chromatin accessibility at specific sites of chromatin, we performed the assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and found that blebbistatin treatment not only differentially regulated global chromatin accessibility, but also specifically increased the accessibility at the promoter or enhancer regions of neuronal genes, including Ascl1, Myt1l, and Tubb3, and Ascl1-target genes (Mfng, Ngfr, Grip1) (Figure 5F-H and Figures S29 and S30, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the reduction of cytoskeletal tension slightly decreased the accessibility at the promoters or enhancer regions of some mesenchymal genes (Figure S31, Supporting Information). To elucidate whether the observed epigenetic changes in active chromatin marks were involved in regulating neuronal gene expression during iN reprogramming, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assay at the promoter regions of Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l, and TUBB3. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed significant increases in AcH3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at all four promoter regions in blebbistatin-treated cells relative to DMSO (Figure 5I). Further examination of other epigenetic mechanisms that may be affected by inhibition of intracellular tension revealed a decrease in the abundance of DNA methylation marker, Figure 3.

Specifically, we examined the role of FA signaling by blocking the activity with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor, PF573228, which we found could alter intracellular tension by decreasing cell and nuclear stiffness (Figure S9, Supporting Information). Western blot analysis showed that PF573228 inhibited the phosphorylation of FAK (pFAK) at Tyrosine 397 (Tyr-397) in a dose-dependent manner and in addition, modulated downstream ERK signaling (Figure S32A, Supporting Information), demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitor. Immunostaining analysis also confirmed that PF573228 reduced pFAK expression in fibroblasts (Figure S32B, Supporting Information). Thereafter, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were induced to reprogram in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of PF573228 to test the effects of FAK inhibition on iN conversion. Interestingly, FAK inhibition significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency in a biphasic manner, similar to blebbistatin treatment, suggesting that a reduction of FAs to an optimal level may facilitate iN conversion (Figure 6A). Although FAK inhibition via PF573228 may influence ERK signaling, we found that the conversion efficiency was not significantly altered when BAM-transduced fibroblasts were treated with various doses of the ERK inhibitor, U0126, suggesting that the inhibition of ERK might not account for the major effect of FAK inhibition on iN reprogramming (Figure S32C, Supporting Information). Further characterization of the iN cells derived in absence and presence of the FAK inhibitor showed that these cells expressed neuronal markers, including NeuN, MAP2, and synapsin, and exhibited functional neuronal properties as assessed by electrophysiological analysis that were comparable to blebbistatin-induced iN cells (Figure 6B,C and Figure S33, Supporting Information).",

Indeed, we found that expression of calponin, \ud835\udefcSMA, and other mesenchymal markers decreased in BAM-transduced fibroblasts that were treated with PF573228 for 2 days (Figure 6D and Figures S34 andS35, Supporting Information). Conversely, neuronal gene expression was greater in fibroblasts transduced with BAM and cultured in the presence of 5 \u03bcm PF573228 at day 5, relative to the control (Figure 6E). As with the reduction of intracellular tension, perturbations of cell adhesions also modulated the epigenetic state. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that fibroblasts treated with the FAK inhibitor exhibited global increases in AcH3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 marks and a concurrent decrease in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 compared to the control cells (Figure 7A and Figure S36, Supporting Information), which coincided with differences in HAT, HDAC, H3K4specific HMT, and H3K4-specific HDM activity (Figure 7B-E). ATAC-seq analysis further revealed that FAK inhibition could increase chromatin accessibility, in particular at the promoter or enhancer regions of neuronal genes (Ascl1, Myt1l, and Tubb3) and Ascl1-target sites (Mfng, Ngfr) (Figure 7F-H and Figures S37 and S38, Supporting Information) and slightly decrease the accessibility of mesenchymal genes (Figure S39, Supporting Information). These changes correlated well with localized site-specific epigenetic changes as ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed significant increases in AcH3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at the promoter regions of Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1, and TUBB3 in PF573228-treated cells relative to DMSO (Figure 7I). In addition, non-transduced fibroblasts treated with the FAK inhibitor for 24 h displayed lower levels of DNA methylation, similar to blebbistatin treatment, as shown by a reduction in 5-mC marks and DNMT activity (Figure 7J-L). These results demonstrate that a lower level of FAK enhances global and local epigenetic changes to promote iN reprogramming."

                        "Given we had observed that reduction of intracellular tension and cell adhesion improved iN reprogramming, we postulated that modulating cell adhesion using biomaterials would produce a similar effect. When fibroblasts were grown on tissue-culture (TC) polystyrene wells or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes with a flat surface or 10-\u03bcm microgrooves, we observed a decrease in stress fibers and phosphorylated FAK on PDMS membranes relative to TC wells, with the lowest levels on 10\u03bcm microgrooves (Figure 8A). Consistently, the iN reprogramming efficiency correlated inversely with stress fibers and FAK phosphorylation (Figure 8B and Figure S40, Supporting Information). In another example, when fibroblasts were cultured on binary colloidal crystals (BCCs) composed of spherical particle materials with distinct silica microparticle sizes (i.e., 5 vs 2 \u03bcm), we observed less cell spreading, paxillin-positive punctate and phosphorylated FAK expression in fibroblasts cultured on 2 \u03bcm BCCs, which coincided with an increase in the reprogramming efficiency (Figure 8C-E). Moreover, cells cultured on these BCCs had decreased cytoskeletal and nuclear stiffness, suggesting that these biomaterials could alter cell stiffness and intracellular tension (Figure S41, Supporting Information). These findings demonstrate the potential of engineering biomaterials to modulate cell adhesion and thus, intracellular tension to enhance iN reprogramming."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a reduction of cytoskeletal tension to an optimal level by using small molecule compounds, FAK inhibition, and material engineering promotes a more open chromatin structure and enhances cell reprogramming. In particular, the reduction of cytoskeletal tension can suppress heterochromatin marks, and increase AcH3 and H3K4 methylation globally and at the promoter of neuronal genes (Figures 5 and7), which in turn facilitates the reprogramming process (as summarized in Figure S42, Supporting Information). It is important to note that this reduction of tension is only required in the early phase of the reprogramming process (3-5 days, Figure 3 and Figure S11, Supporting Information), suggesting that modulation of the epigenetic state is critical for initiating the reprogramming process but not necessarily for the maturation of the neuronal phenotype. Interestingly, in comparison to blebbistatin, other actin and microtubule modulators such as cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide, and nocodazole have opposite effects, that is, decreasing euchromatin marks (e.g., AcH3; Figures S27 andS28, Supporting Information) and inhibiting iN conversion (Figure 3) while jasplakinolide enhances actin polymerization and nocodazole induces stress fibers, cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Therefore, these findings are consistent with the notion that a reduction of intracellular tension to an optimal level without compromising essential cell functions can promote epigenetic changes and cell reprogramming.",
                "Our results suggest that intracellular tension regulates the epigenetic state through nuclear enzyme activities such as the increase of nuclear HAT and H3K4 HMT activity and the decrease in nuclear activity of HDAC and H3K4 HDM (Figures 5 and7). One potential mechanism is the translocation of these enzymes between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Indeed, cytoskeleton tension can affect nuclear transport. [34] In addition, we show that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension causes the wrinkling and partial disassembly of nuclear lamina but does not induce a detachment of lamina-associated domain (LAD) of chromatin from the nuclear lamina (Figure S43, Supporting Information). How these nuclear lamina changes regulate the transport of epigenetic enzyme activities remains to be determined. Furthermore, reducing intracellular tension suppresses the expression of mesenchymal genes in euchromatin (Figures 4 and6), which may be attributed to both the decrease of accessibility at promoter and enhancer regions and the translocation of transcriptional factors. [35][36][37] It is worth noting that mechanotransduction mechanisms in adherent cells may differ from cells being deformed in suspension. Cells in suspension have low-to-none intracellular tension, and transient squeezing has a direct physical effect on the nucleus such as the partial disruption of the nuclear lamina and LAD association, which causes a decrease in heterochromatin marks including H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. [11] When cells experience biomaterials with different shapes or sizes at micro or nano levels, the cell shape, FA formation, and actin cytoskeleton assembly may be affected. [12,[38][39][40] As a result, cytoskeletal tension, which is coupled to cell adhesions and ECM, may be reduced or enhanced. Since FAs can transmit forces outside-in or inside-out between the ECM and intracellular actin cytoskeleton, this represents an exciting opportunity to boost cell reprogramming by engineering the properties of cell adhesive substrates such as ligand density, stiffness, and micro/nano-topography. [38,[41][42][43][44][45][46] Indeed, our results indicate that a reduction in cell spreading and FA signaling using micro/nano materials can facilitate the reprogramming process (Figure 8). Taken together, our findings provide a potential explanation for the mechanotransduction mechanism by which cytoskeletal tension and cell adhesion can modulate reprogramming, and a rational basis for the design of novel biomaterials with biophysical properties that can be altered to provide an optimal level of cell was determined by a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison test.

[52] 33 285 genes were detected across DMSO-(10 079 and 11 528 cells tested for replicates) and blebbistatin-treated samples (7503 and 9557 cells tested for replicates). Cells that had unique feature counts with at least 200 genes but no more than 7000 genes and cells that had <5% mitochondrial counts were filtered and normalized based on the feature expression and total expression of each cell. The normalized expression data were then used for subsequent analysis.",
                "10x Single-Cell RNA Sequencing: Dimensional Reduction, Clustering, Differential Gene Expression Analysis, and Single Cell Trajectory Analysis: Principal component analysis was performed using highly variable genes in each sample after linear transformation and the first 10 PC scores were used for UMAP analysis to cluster the cells into 12 groups (FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions implemented in the Seurat package, dims = 10, resolution = 0.6). The marker genes of each cluster were identified using FindAllMarkers function with default parameters. Clusters were annotated using canonical genes in the neural reprogramming process and published datasets as reference, [53] where nine clusters were finally identified to represent different phases of reprogramming. The percentage of cells expressing neuronal genes including MAPT, TUBB3, STMN3, and SNAP25 were examined to show evidence for neuronal reprogramming. Single-cell trajectory analysis was performed using Monocle3. [54,55] Clusters identified by Seurat were used for cell ordering, and trajectory visualization using default parameters in Monocle3 analysis.",
                "10x Single-Cell RNA Sequencing: Pseudobulk Differential Expression Analysis: A pseudobulk method was applied to investigate differential gene expression among DMSO-and blebbistatin-treated samples at the population level. Specifically, the raw counts of each sample were extracted after QC filtering. The counts were then aggregated to the sample level to be used for the differential expression analysis using DESeq2. [50] Genes that were up-or down-regulated in blebbistatin-treated conditions compared to DMSO-treated conditions were defined with p adj = 0.05 as the threshold. GO enrichment analysis was then performed toward up-and downregulated genes using the enrichGO function in clusterProfiler package. [56] Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing: Cell Preparation, Transposition Reaction, ATAC-Seq Library Construction, and Sequencing: A total of 1 000 000 fibroblasts treated with vehicle control (DMSO), 10 \u03bcm blebbistatin, or 5 \u03bcm PF573228 were collected after 2 h and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to sample processing. ATAC-seq was performed as described previously. [57] In brief, frozen cells were thawed and washed once with PBS and then resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of cold PBS. The cell number was assessed by Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelom Bioscience, Massachusetts, USA). 100 000 cells were then added to ATAC lysis buffer and centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g in a pre-chilled centrifuge for 5 min. Supernatant was removed and the nuclei were resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of tagmentation reaction mix by pipetting up and down. The reactions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1000 rpm, and then cleaned up using the MiniElute reaction clean up kit (Qiagen). Tagmented DNA was amplified with barcoded primers. Library quality and quantity were assessed with Qubit 2.0 DNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher), Tapestation High Sensitivity D1000 Assay (Agilent Technologies), and QuantStudio 5 System (Applied Biosystems). Equimolar pooling of libraries was performed based on QC values and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq (Illumina, California, USA) with a read length configuration of 150 PE for [100]M PE reads (50 m in each direction) per sample.",
                "Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing: Mapping, Peak Calling, and Differential Peak Analysis: FASTQ files were trimmed with Trim Galore and Cutadapt. [58] Pair-ended reads were then aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) with Bowtie2. [59] Mitochondrial reads and PCR duplicates were removed using SAMtools [60] and Picard (http: //broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), respectively. Peaks were called over input using MACS3, [61] and only peaks outside the ENCODE blacklist region were kept. All peaks from all samples were combined and merged using bedtools and featureCount [62] was used to count the mapped reads for each sample. Peaks that were up-or down-regulated under different conditions were defined by using DESeq2 [50] with p adj = 0.001 as the threshold. Peaks located at cis-regulatory elements related to genes of interest (\u00b15 kb region) were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) [63] to demonstrate differentially up-or down-regulated differential peaks. To identify differentially accessible regions around Ascl1-targeting genes, an Ascl1 ChIP-seq dataset that was previously published [27] (GSE43916, Ascl1 MEF) was utilized. Genome coordinates of peaks were converted from mm9 to mm10 reference genome by using UCSC liftOver tools. ATAC peaks around Ascl1-target genes were visualized using IGV.",
