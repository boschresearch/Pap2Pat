                        "As discussed in detail below, it has been discovered that an innovative microfluidic device can be used to optimize a number of different methodologies for cell reprogramming and gene editing. In one illustration of this, microfluidic devices of the invention can be used to significantly enhance methods of cellular reprogramming. Cellular reprogramming represents a major advancement in biology, and has wide applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug screening. Despite the enormous potential of reprogramming technologies, low and variable efficiencies in cell reprogramming, in particular, during induced neuronal (iN) conversion, have created significant roadblocks to the full application of this technology. The invention disclosed herein overcomes these roadblocks by providing optimized methods and systems that are useful in a variety of cellular engineering methodologies, including for example methods designed to enhance direct iN cellular reprogramming.",
                        "Embodiments of the invention include high throughput microfluidic systems with microchannels having sizes and architectures (e.g., cell-type specific designs) that are selected to deform cell nuclei and induce chromatin reorganization in a manner that boosts the efficiency of a variety of methods for modulating the fate and function of mammalian cells including cellular reprogramming, transcriptional activation/suppression, gene addition, gene deletion, gene editing and the like. Such embodiments include, for example, a microfluidic cell culture/processing system comprising: an inlet reservoir configured to receive cells; an outlet reservoir to remove cells from the microfluidic system; and at least one channel coupling the inlet reservoir to the outlet reservoir. In such microfluidic processing systems, the at least one channel is configured so that selected mammalian cells contact the channel and experience cellular and/or nuclear deformation as the cells are moved from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir. In illustrative working embodiments of the invention, the inlet reservoir, the outlet reservoir and the at least one channel are disposed on a polydimethylsiloxane device in a lab-on-a-chip configuration.",
                        "As discussed in the Examples below, we utilized size selected mammalian cells and microfluidic channels to induce a millisecond deformation of the cell nucleus of cells going through the channel, a deformation which caused the wrinkling and transient disassembly of the nuclear lamina, local detachment of lamina-associated domain of chromatin from nuclear lamina, and a decrease of histone methylation (H3K9me3) and DNA methylation. Moreover, we have discovered that such mechanical squeezing of cells results in global changes in chromatin, which then enhances associated efforts to modulate the fate and function of cells, for example the reprogramming of cells (e.g., reprogramming fibroblasts into neurons). This mechanopriming approach can further be used enhance other reprogramming processes such as turning macrophages into neurons and converting fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells.",
                        "In view of the discovery that mechanopriming approaches using selected cells and channel sizes can enhance cellular reprogramming as well as a number of other genetic engineering processes, embodiments of the invention include methods of deforming cells in the microfluidic systems of the invention. For example, embodiments of the invention include a method of determining the size of the mammalian cell and further selecting a width/height and/or architecture of the at least one channel in the microfluidic cell culture system such that the mammalian cell contacts the channel and undergoes cellular and/or nuclear deformation as the cell moves from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir, such that the cells are collected from the microfluidic cell culture system. In some embodiments of the invention, the aspect ratio of the channel width and height and/or the cross-section area ratio of the cell and microchannel is further selected. For example, certain embodiments of the invention selectively utilize channels having an aspect ratio between 0.2 and 1 (e.g., an aspect ratio of about 0.5). In addition, certain embodiments of the invention selectively utilize cells observed to exhibit a defined cross-section area ratio, such as a cross-section area ratio between 0.75 and 1.25 (e.g., a cross-section area ratio of about 1). Typically in these methods, the mammalian cells are selected to be mammalian cells in single cell suspension.",
                        "The microfluidic cell processing systems disclosed herein can be used to generate a wide variety of cells with high efficiency for applications such as tissue/organ regeneration, disease modeling/drug screening and disease therapies. For example, methods of the invention include those designed for: (1) high-efficiency conversion of any cell types (e.g., skin biopsy, blood cells) into induced pluripotent stem cells or any other cells (e.g., neurons, cardiomyocytes, pancreatic cells); (2) high-efficiency guided stem cell differentiation (e.g., stem cell differentiation into neurons, cardiomyocytes, pancreatic cells); (3) boosting the efficiency of gene therapy and gene introduction/transduction in vitro, e.g., creating CAR-macrophages, CAR-T cells with higher efficiency; and (4) reorganizing the chromatin to facilitate the rejuvenation of cells.",
                        "In certain embodiments of the methods invention, cells disposed in the microfluidic devices disclosed herein are manipulated under such culture conditions. In some embodiments of the invention, a microfluidic cell processing system of the invention is used to facilitate reprogramming and/or differentiation of mammalian cells. In some embodiments of the invention, a microfluidic cell culture system of the invention is used to boost the efficiency of gene editing and the like in mammalian cells. In certain embodiments, somatic cells are induced to reprogram into neuronal cells in this microfluidic cell culture system.",
                        "In Example 2, we show that a reduction of intracellular tension by action cytoskeleton disruption or FA inhibition to an optimal level can generally increase the chromatin accessibility to facilitate gene activation and cell reprogramming. This manipulation of intracellular tension and cell adhesion can be achieved by chemical compounds (e.g., inhibitor for actin-myosin interactions such as blebbistatin, focal adhesion kinase inhibitor PF573228, and any chemical compounds that interfere the assembly and dynamics of actin cytoskeleton and FAs), and/or cell adhesion substrates that reduce cell adhesion and intracellular tension to an optimal level by engineering the ionic property, ligand density, surface topography (e.g., micro/nano structure) and any other properties affecting cell adhesion.",
                        "In Example 5 and 6, we show that the mechanical properties of adhesion substrates such as stiffness and viscoelasticity have profound effects on chromatin accessibility and cell reprogramming. For example, an intermediate stiffness, rather than stiff or soft surfaces, results in highest cell reprogramming efficiency; viscoelastic property at low stiffness surface (e.g., 0.1-5 kPa) can further enhance cell reprogramming. Therefore, tailoring the stiffness and viscoelastic properties of materials can be used to modulate the epigenetic state of cells and thus the efficiency of reprogramming and gene editing.",
                        "In certain embodiments of the invention, the mammalian cells are configured as three-dimensional spheroids. In Example 4, we show that cell reprogramming in 3D spheroids has much higher efficiency than 2D surface and that the reprogramming appears to start from the surface of the spheroids. These effects are related to the 3D cell-cell interactions that are not present in 2D culture and the resulting epigenetic changes in 3D culture. Therefore, this 3D spheroid culture approach can be used to promote cell reprogramming and gene editing. The spheroid size can be 100-500 \u03bcm (cannot be too big; otherwise may cause cell death in the core of spheroids).",

The following text discusses various embodiments of the invention.",
                        "Cell reprogramming has wide applications in tissue regeneration, disease modeling and personalized medicine, but low reprogramming efficiency remains a challenge. In addition to biochemical cues, biophysical factors can modulate the epigenetic state and a variety of cell functions. However, how biophysical factors help overcome the epigenetic barrier for cell reprogramming is not well understood.",
                        "The invention described herein involves using an innovative microfluidic device, specific cytoskeletal and adhesion inhibitors, and three-dimensional (3D) spheroids to significantly promote cell reprogramming, respectively, more specifically direct induced neuronal reprogramming. Cell reprogramming represents a major advancement in biology, and has wide applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug screening. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from somatic cells by the forced expression of Oct4, Sox2, KLF4 and c-Myc (OSKM) and/or other factors. Direct reprogramming is the process of converting from one cell type into a very distantly related cell type without proceeding through an intermediate pluripotent stage. For example, it has been shown that mouse embryonic and postnatal fibroblasts can be converted into induced neuronal (iN) cells via the forced expression of three transcription factors: Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l (BAM). This approach was later applied to generate iN cells from human fibroblasts using Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l and NeuroD1 (BAMN). This direct reprogramming approach has tremendous implications not only for basic science, but also for disease modeling and therapeutic testing, functionalizing knowledge for engineering improved replacement cells and tissues, and in situ regeneration and healing of cells already in or near the site of injury without the cancer risks of pluripotent cell products. Despite the potential of this technology, low and variable efficiencies in cell reprogramming, in particular, during iN conversion, are significant roadblocks to their application. Therefore, this invention sets to overcome this barrier by providing distinct methods to enhance direct iN reprogramming.",
                        "As discussed in detail below, the invention disclosed herein has a number of embodiments. Embodiments of the invention include microfluidic cell processing/culturing systems having elements including channels of a size/configuration selected to deform the nuclei of mammalian cells as they move/migrate through the channel. Embodiments of the invention include, for example, a microfluidic cell culture system comprising: an inlet reservoir configured to receive cells; an outlet reservoir to remove cells from the cell culture system; and at least one channel coupling the inlet reservoir to the outlet reservoir. In such microfluidic cell culture systems, the at least one channel is configured so that a mammalian cell contacts the sides and bottom of the channel and undergoes cellular and nuclear deformation as the cell migrates from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir. In illustrative working embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, the inlet reservoir, the outlet reservoir and the at least one channel are disposed on a polydimethylsiloxane matrix in a lab on a chip configuration (see, e.g., FIG. 11). Certain embodiments of the invention further modulate cell adhesion by engineering 3D biomaterials (pore sizes, charge, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity/zwitterionic property, etc. of the device as well as materials processed through the device) or 2D surfaces to increase chromatin accessibility for cell reprogramming and gene editing.",
                        "In typical embodiments of the invention, the microfluidic cell system of the invention further comprises mammalian cells. Typically, mammalian cells are selected for use in a microfluidic cell culture system embodiment of the invention by determining the size of the mammalian cell and further selecting a width and/or architecture of the at least one channel in the microfluidic cell culture system such that the mammalian cell contacts the channel so as to undergo cellular and/or nuclear deformation as the cell migrates from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir. In certain embodiments of the invention, the mammalian cells are selected to be or configured as three-dimensional spheroids. In illustrative embodiments of the invention, the mammalian cells are somatic cells, induced pluripotent stem cells. In some embodiments of the invention, mammalian cells disposed within microfluidic cell culture system are genetically modified and/or combined with an agent selected to modulate the physiology of the mammalian cells such as a cytoskeleton inhibitor, an adhesion inhibitor (e.g. PF573228), a TGF-3/Activin pathway inhibitor (e.g. A83-01), a BMP pathway inhibitor (e.g. K02288), and blebbistatin. In illustrative embodiments of the invention, the agents are small molecule agents (i.e., molecules having a molecular weight of <900 Da). Such agents can be used to decrease actin cytoskeleton tension or cell adhesion to increase chromatin accessibility and thus enhance the efficiency of cell reprogramming and gene editing. In certain embodiments of the invention, the mammalian cells disposed in the microfluidic cell culture system are transduced with an exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., one encoding a mammalian transcription factor such as Ascl1, Brn2 or Myt1l).",

Exemplary CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complexes include CRISPR/Cas9 CRISPR-associated endonuclease activity and CRISPR/Cpf1 CRISPR-associated endonuclease activity. CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting requires a custom single-lead RNA (sgRNA) consisting of a targeted sequence (crRNA sequence) and a Cas9 nucleic acid recruitment sequence (tracrRNA). The crRNA region is a sequence of about 20 nucleotides, homologous to one of the regions of the gene you are interested in, that will guide the activity of the Cas9 nuclease. Examples of these CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complexes, the CRISPR-associated RNA and protein components, and CRISPR-associated endonuclease systems are disclosed in the following references: Collingwood, M.

                        "In view of the discovery that mechanopriming approaches using selected cells and channel sizes in a microfluidic cell culture system can enhance cellular reprogramming as well as a number of other genetic engineering processes, embodiments of the invention include methods of culturing, reprogramming, and engineering cells in the microfluidic cell culture systems of the invention. For example, embodiments of the invention include a method of culturing a mammalian cell comprising selecting the mammalian cell for culturing in a microfluidic cell culture system of the invention, wherein selecting the mammalian cell comprises determining the size and/or cross-section area ratio of the mammalian cell and/or the mammalian cell nucleus, and further selecting a width and/or architecture (e.g. aspect ratio) of the at least one channel in the microfluidic cell culture system such that the mammalian cell contacts the channel so as to undergo cellular and/or nuclear deformation as the cell migrates from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir, such that the cells are cultured in the microfluidic cell culture system. Typically in these methods, the mammalian cells are selected to be mammalian cells that have formed three dimensional aggregates.",
                        "Studies have shown the capability of the microfluidics device to promote gene editing efficiency via cell nucleus deformation. As disclosed herein, we have discovered that the design of the cross-section geometry of microchannels of the invention is a critical factor of this enhancement of methods such as gene editing. In order to observe significant criterium for channel design and selection, we varied two dimensionless numbers: Aspect Ratio (AR)=Channel Width/Channel Height, and Cross-section Area Ratio (CR)=Cross-sectional Area of Cell Nuclei/Cross-sectional Area of Microchannel (FIG. 12A). As shown by the data presented in FIG. 12, we observed cell reprogramming in different channel widths and architectures where mouse fibroblasts were converted into neurons as a model to observe appropriate AR and CR parameters that result in the highest gene editing efficiency. We performed these cell reprogramming experiments using two different cell types, mouse ear-derived fibroblasts (MERF) with an averaged cell nucleus diameter of 11 \u03bcm, and mouse macrophages with an averaged cell nucleus diameter of 8 \u03bcm. The reprogramming efficiency to convert these two cell types into induced neuronal (iN) cells was used as a readout to identify appropriate AR and CR parameters.",
                        "As noted above, in certain methodological embodiments of the invention, the average diameter of a cell and/or the average diameter of the cell nucleus and/or the cross-section area ratio of the cell or cell nucleus is determined (e.g. the average cellular or nuclear diameter a particular cell type such as a fibroblast, a T cell, a macrophage etc.) and this information is then used to select the size and/or architecture of the microfluidic channel to be used with these cells. Typically in such methods of the invention, the diameter of the channel is selected to be smaller than the diameter of the cell and/or the cell nucleus, and not larger than the diameter of the cell. In certain embodiments of the invention, the at least one channel is selected to be at least 2 \u03bcm and not more than 200 m in width (e.g., a channel less than 3 \u03bcm, 7 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm, 15 \u03bcm, 20 \u03bcm or 25 \u03bcm, 50 \u03bcm or 100 \u03bcm in width). In some embodiments of the invention, the aspect ratio of the channel is further designed or selected. For example, certain embodiments of the invention selectively utilize channels having an aspect ratio between 0.2 and 1 such as an AR from 0.25 to 0.75 (e.g., an aspect ratio of about 0.5, such as an aspect ratio within 10% of 0.5). In addition, certain embodiments of the invention selectively utilize cells observed to exhibit a cross-section area ratio between 0.75 and 1.25 (e.g., a cross-section area ratio of about 1, such as a cross-section area ratio within 10% of 1). While the channels typically exhibit a rectangular cross-sectional architecture, other shapes (oval, polygonal) of microchannel cross-section can work. In general, if the dimension of microchannels in one direction is smaller than cell nucleus size, this is observed improve gene editing efficiency and cell reprogramming.",
                        "For the experiments shown in FIG. 12, cells were transduced with lentiviral constructs to express reprogramming factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l for the induction of neuronal genes. Then the cells were migrated through microchannels with various cross-section areas (different AR and CR), including 10 different sizes of the microchannel for MERF and 4 sizes of microchannels for macrophages. As shown in FIG. 12B, a microchannel with a width of 7 \u03bcm and a height of 13 \u03bcm was optimal for fibroblasts and induced the highest level of reprogramming efficiency, and a channel with a width of 5 \u03bcm and a height of 10 \u03bcm was optimal for macrophages (FIG. 12B). These results suggest that the optimal cross-section would have AR\u02dc0.5 and CR\u02dc1. Since the distribution of cell nucleus sizes may vary for each cell type, which may affect the average nucleus diameter, the optimal levels may fluctuate around these AR and CR values. Based on our findings, in typical embodiments of the invention, (1) either the width or height of the microchannel cross-section should be less than the nucleus diameter to effectively induce changes in chromatin organization and improve cell reprogramming; (2) the optimal cross-section would have AR-0.5 and CR-1; (3) an AR between 0.2 and 1 may cause chromatin changes and improve cell reprogramming, if there is no significant effect on cell viability; (4) regarding CR, microchannels with CR<1 may exert squeezing to nucleus; if CR>1, either width or height of the microchannel cross-section needs to be <nucleus diameter.",
                        "This optimization process provides guidance for the methods of making and using the microfluidics devices of the invention disclosed herein. For example, in certain embodiments of the invention, the design of the microchannel is determined based on the cell nucleus size. In this context, optimization experiments with different cells and/or techniques can be run in initial tests to maximize gene editing efficiency for different types of cells, methods which can expand the applications of this innovative microfluidics device to different gene editing models. This can further expand the applications of this device in disease modeling, drug screening and cell therapy with different cell types. Moreover, personalized medicine will be possible by designing the microfluidics device individually based on the nucleus size of the cells collected from the patient.",
                        "In embodiments of the methods invention, selected cells are manipulated under such culture conditions where the cells are disposed in a microfluidic cell culture system. In some embodiments of the invention, a microfluidic cell culture system of the invention is used to facilitate reprogramming and/or differentiation of mammalian cells. In some embodiments of the invention, a microfluidic cell culture system of the invention is used to boost the efficiency of gene editing and the like of mammalian cells, In one such embodiment, somatic cells are induced to reprogram into pluripotent stem cells in this microfluidic cell culture system. In certain embodiments, somatic cells are induced to reprogram into neuronal cells in this microfluidic cell culture system. Typically in these methods, the mammalian cells are further combined with an agent selected to modulate the physiology of the mammalian cells such as a cytoskeleton inhibitor, an adhesion inhibitor (e.g. PF573228), a TGF-\u03b2/Activin pathway inhibitor (e.g. A83-01), a BMP pathway inhibitor (e.g. K02288), and blebbistatin. Optionally in these methods, the mammalian cells comprise an exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., an expression vector such as one including an inducible promoter). In certain methods of the invention, the size of the at least one channel in the microfluidic cell culture system is selected such that the mammalian cell contacts the channel and experiences transient disassembly of nuclear lamina as the cell migrates from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir. Typically in these methods, the cells undergo nuclear deformation for less than one second.",
                        "A related embodiment of the invention is a method of culturing (and typically modulating the physiology) of mammalian cells comprising disposing mammalian cells in the inlet reservoir of a microfluidic cell culture system disclosed herein, and then migrating the mammalian cells from the inlet reservoir through the at least one channel to the outlet reservoir; wherein the mammalian cells undergo mechanical deformation as the cells migrate from the inlet reservoir through the channel to the outlet reservoir (i.e, mammalian cells cultured in the microfluidic cell culture system are mechanical squeezed as they migrate through channels/conduits in the microfluidic cell culture system).",
                        "As discussed in the Examples below, we utilized microfluidic channels of selected widths to induce a millisecond deformation of the cell nucleus, which caused the wrinkling and transient disassembly of the nuclear lamina, local detachment of lamina-associated domain in chromatin, and a decrease of histone methylation (H3K9me3) and DNA methylation. As disclosed herein, we further discovered that such global changes in chromatin at the early stage of cell reprogramming boosted the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons. Consistently, inhibition of H3K9 and DNA methylation partially mimicked the effects of mechanical squeezing on iN reprogramming efficiency, while the inhibition of H3K9 demethylase blocked nuclear deformation-enhanced reprogramming. In addition, knocking down lamin A had similar effects to mechanical squeezing. Furthermore, this mechanopriming approach can enhance other reprogramming processes such as turning macrophages into neurons and converting fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells, and can be scaled up to mechanically modulate epigenetic state for cell engineering.",
                        "Embodiments of the invention include a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based microfluidics lab-on-chip as shown in FIG. 11, one where the template includes three different channel widths (3 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm and 7 \u03bcm) and 10 \u03bcm height, with each device containing 20 parallel aligned channels. In illustrative methods for using such devices, mouse ear-derived fibroblasts are infected with Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors for BAM for 24 hours, then the media is replaced to 10% FBS DMEM medium for 12 hours, followed by the addition of Dox for 6 hours. Upon passaging the cells using trypsin and re-suspending in DMEM medium without FBS, 1*106 cells/ml pass through the channel at a flow velocity rate of 20 \u03bcl/min. After cells pass through the device, cells are cultured on glass slides coated with 10 \u03bcmg/ml fibronectin for 3 hours, enabling the cells to attach and for the cell membrane to recover. The media is then changed to N2B27 medium for neural induction.",
                        "Moreover, we have discovered that several small molecule compounds that disrupt intracellular structures can be utilized to enhance iN reprogramming. In illustrative reprogramming experiments, adult mouse ear fibroblasts were transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors encoding for BAM, and seeded onto laminin coated tissue culture dishes. Twenty-four hours after plating, Dox was added into media composed of DMEM, 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. The following day the media was replaced to N2B27 medium wherein fibroblasts were treated with various chemical inhibitors for first 7 days. Two weeks after post-Dox induction, iN cells were identified via immunostaining for neuronal beta-III tubulin (TUJ1) and the reprogramming efficiency was determined. We have found that disruption of actin-myosin contractility via treatment with blebbistatin enhanced the efficiency of iN conversion (i.e. 4.5-fold increase compared to control). Similarly, inhibition of cell adhesion using the focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, PF573228, also promoted iN reprogramming in a biphasic manner (FIG. 10C). Furthermore, our findings suggest that the disruption of focal adhesions and cytoskeletal contractility modulates the epigenetic state of the chromatin and the expression of neuronal genes.",
                        "In addition, we have also discovered that the use of cells selected to be in 3D spheroids in the microfluidic systems of the invention not only promotes earlier onset of iN reprogramming, but unexpectedly enhances reprogramming efficiency by over 67-fold after just 2 weeks, relative to conventional two dimensional (2D) methods. The enhancement displays a characteristic spatial distribution of a peripheral layer enriched with neurons surrounding an unreprogrammed spheroid core. Inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2/Activin and BMP pathways, which suppresses the mesenchymal phenotype, helps remove the spatial heterogeneity of reprogramming for improved efficiency. This combination of microfluidic cell systems, 3D spheroid cultures and chemical inhibitors in iN generation is a powerful technology to improve the translation of iN conversion.",
                        "For the reduction to practice, primary human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (hNDFs) were transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors for the BAMN factors. After Dox induction in monolayer to ensure unbiased activation of the transgenes, hNDFs were either plated onto Matrigel-coated cover slips as 2D controls or centrifuged in microwells to form 3D aggregates, or \u201cspheroids\u201d (FIG. 9A). The expression of neuron-specific \u03b2-tubulin III (Tuj1) was used as a marker of neuronal fate, as is convention. Tuj1 expression began earlier in spheroids than in 2D culture, appearing as early as day 2 (two days after Dox induction and one day after spheroid formation) (FIG. 9BC). To evaluate relative reprogramming efficiency, spheroids were replated onto Matrigel-coated cover slips after three days without enzymatic disaggregation. At two weeks post-dox induction, monolayer iNs still displayed very few Tuj1+ cells (0.06%; FIG. 9E). Spheroid iNs, in contrast, had dramatically improved neural conversion (4.06%, FIG. 9D), by over 67-fold (FIG. 9F).",
                        "Inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2/Activin/Nodal pathway with the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor ALK4/5/7 inhibitor, A83-01 (A) (FIG. 10C), or the BMP pathway with BMP7 type I receptor kinase ALK2 inhibitor, K02288 (K) (FIG. 10D), alone did not affect spatial Tuj1+ reprogramming patterns relative to no-treatment controls (FIG. 10A). Application of both chemicals for dual pathway inhibition, however, enhanced Tuj1 expression on the spheroid interior without eliminating peripheral expression (FIG. 10B). These results suggest that the mesenchymal identity in the core of spheroids may be the barrier to neuronal reprogramming, and that targeting this barrier would provide even better conversion efficiency.",
                        "There are several innovative conceptual and technical aspects in this invention: (1) this microfluidics lab-on-chip is a high-throughput device which can process one million cells in one hour while retaining the viability of the majority of cells. More importantly, as the cells pass through the device, they undergo cell and nuclear deformation that unexpectedly leads to a 7-fold increase in the reprogramming efficiency compared to the control group. (2) Utilizing this biophysical cue-based chip to promote the reprogramming efficiency is a fast and minimally invasive approach, whereby the deformation experienced by cells in a short period of time (i.e. few seconds) is sufficient enough to significantly increase the reprogramming efficiency. (3) The proposed small molecules offer a simple and more efficient method to promote iN reprogramming from adult fibroblasts, compared to standard culture conditions, through the simple addition of these chemical compounds to the culture medium. (4) The 3D niche of spheroids has marked advantages in being easily scalable, as well as the capability of synergizing with biochemical factors (e.g. chemical inhibitors) to enhance conversion efficiency even further.",

                                "Cell reprogramming technologies, such as somatic cell nuclear transfer, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, and direct reprogramming, can be used to derive desirable cell types and have wide applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug screening1-3. Direct reprogramming enables the conversion of one cell type into another desired cell type by circumventing the pluripotent stage and time-consuming differentiation process, as exemplified in the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons4, cardiomyocytes5, \u03b2-islet cells6, blood cell progenitors7, and hepatocytes8. However, the low efficiency of these conversion processes presents a barrier for biomedical applications. For example, mouse neonatal fibroblasts can be converted into induced neuronal (iN) cells via ectopic expression of three transcription factors: Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l (BAM), with an efficiency of 1.8-7.7%, but with a much lower efficiency for adult fibroblasts9.",
                                "A critical step in cell reprogramming is to overcome the epigenetic barrier of heterochromatin and turn on the endogenous genes for cell type conversion. Most of the previous studies have focused on the roles of transcriptional factors and biochemical factors in cell reprogramming10,11, but the effects of biophysical factors are much less understood. Cells experience mechanical stimuli at both short and long time scales, from seconds to days, which may result in mechano-chemical signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization and chromatin changes12-17. For example, surface topography induces an elongated nuclear shape and increases histone H3 acetylation (AcH3) and H3K4 methylation during fibroblast reprogramming into iPSCs18, and three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel increases H3K4 methylation in T cells19. In addition, soft matrix decreases H3K9me3 in tumor cells in a cell type-dependent manner20, and persistent uniaxial stretching of adhesive substrates decreases H3K9me3 in epidermal cells21. Interestingly, compression on the side of adherent mesenchymal cells enhances histone acetylation, while compression on the top of adherent fibroblasts leads to an increase of heterochromatin22,23. These differential responses to various biophysical cues suggest that mechanotransduction to the nucleus is context-dependent in adherent cells, which may be attributed to the differences in specific biophysical cues, cell types, cell adhesions and cytoskeleton organization. Regardless of all these variations, we postulated that an appropriate mechanical perturbation of the cell nucleus could induce chromatin remodeling and help overcome the heterochromatin barrier for cell reprogramming. Cells in suspension offer a valuable model to test this hypothesis, in which the complexity of extracellular signals (e.g., adhesion polarity, matrix stiffness, ligand presentation) and intracellular components (focal adhesion complex, cytoskeleton organization) are removed or reduced. Therefore, to directly determine the effect of nuclear deformation on chromatin remodeling, we investigated whether mechanically squeezing suspended cells could regulate the epigenetic state and cell reprogramming, and explored the translation of the findings into mechano-biotechnology applications.",
                                "**Results**",
                                "Microfluidic devices have been used to study how cell deformation affects gene transfer and cancer cell responses24-26, but smaller microchannels are needed to directly deform cell nucleus. To investigate the effect of nuclear deformation on direct reprogramming, we developed a microfluidic device with various sizes of constriction microchannels, and forced cells in suspension to flow through these channels (FIG. 1a and Fig. S1 in Song et al.). To determine a proper channel dimension that would enable nuclear deformation while maintaining cell viability, we measured the size of mouse fibroblasts (19.7\u00b14.5 \u03bcm) and their nuclei (10.5\u00b11.2 \u03bcm) (FIG. 1b in Song et al.), and fabricated microdevices that had parallel constriction channels with the same height (15 m) but different widths (3, 5, 7 and 9 \u03bcm). Cells passing through wide microfluidic channels (200 \u03bcm) did not show significant nuclear deformation (Fig. S2 in Song et al.), and were used as a control in all studies.",
                                "Cells were collected at the outlet of the microdevices and seeded onto fibronectin-coated wells. The cells passing through bigger channels (200, 9 and 7 \u03bcm wide) had negligible unattached cells after 3 hours, but 5-\u03bcm and 3-\u03bcm wide microchannels caused significant cell damage, where 19% and 35% of cells could not attach respectively (FIG. 1c in Song et al.). To determine the effect of nuclear deformation on cell membrane integrity, a fluorescently-tagged antibody (Cy5-Ab) was added to the culture media of fibroblasts in suspension before and during the introduction into the microfluidic device. In attached cells, Cy5-Ab could be detected in 31% and 76% of cells passing through 5-\u03bcm and 3-\u03bcm wide channels, respectively, suggesting that a transient cell membrane leakage occurred25,27 (FIG. 1d-e in Song et al.). This cell membrane leakage was also detected in 6% of cells passing through 7-\u03bcm wide microchannels but not in 9-\u03bcm or 200-\u03bcm wide channels. Additionally, Cy5-Ab was detected in 6.5% and 23% of the nuclei in the cells passing 5-\u03bcm and 3-\u03bcm wide microchannels but not bigger microchannels, indicating that microchannels less than 5-\u03bcm induced an increase of nuclear transport or nuclear membrane leakage (FIG. 1d-e in Song et al.). Furthermore, by using fibroblasts expressing histone 2B (H2B)-GFP, we observed that 3-\u03bcm and 5-\u03bcm wide channels, but not 7-\u03bcm and 9-\u03bcm wide channels, induced significant nuclear blebbing or segregation after squeezing (FIG. 1d and Fig. S3 in Song et al.). Consistently, in fibroblasts expressing an NLS-GFP (green fluorescent protein with a nuclear localization signal) reporter, there was a diffusion of NLS-GFP into the cytoplasm in >5% cells passing through 5-\u03bcm and 3-\u03bcm microchannels, indicating that nuclear rupture had occurred (Fig. S4 in Song et al.).",
                                "The rupture of cell membrane and nuclear envelope may induce DNA damage and cell death28,29. We first performed live/dead cell staining and PrestoBlue assays to directly assess how microchannel width affected cell viability. In comparison to the control group (passing through 200-\u03bcm channel), 7 and 9 \u03bcm-wide channels did not induce noticeable cell death at 3 hours and one day after mechanical deformation (FIG. 1f and Fig. S5 in Song et al.). In contrast, after passage through 3 \u03bcm- and 5-\u03bcm wide channels, cell viability decreased significantly. In addition, in comparison to 7-\u03bcm and 9-\u03bcm wide channels that induced little DNA damage (2.2% and 0.7% respectively), 3-\u03bcm and 5-\u03bcm wide channels induced significant (20-50%) DNA damage (Fig. S6 in Song et al.). Based on these findings, we used 7-\u03bcm microchannels for the rest of the studies.",
                                "As flow rate could affect the rate of nuclear deformation and cell aggregation in microchannels, we examined cell viability and channel clogging at various flow rates in 7-\u03bcm microchannels. As shown in Fig. S7 in Song et al., the cell viability was not affected at a flow rate of 10 or 20 \u03bcL/minute. However, flow rates higher than 40 \u03bcL/min significantly decreased cell viability and caused cell aggregation and clogging in microchannels. Therefore, we used 20 \u03bcL/minute as an optimal flow rate to maintain a high throughput and cell viability. As measured by ultrafast imaging of the cell squeezing process, it took an average of 6.8 milliseconds (ms) for a cell to pass through a 7 \u03bcm-wide microchannel at 20 \u03bcL/minute flow rate (FIG. 1g in Song et al.), which resulted in a transient nuclear deformation.",
                                "To evaluate the effects of nuclear deformation on the mechanical properties of the nucleus, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to measure the elastic modulus of cells at multiple time points after deformation. As shown in FIG. 1h in Song et al., in comparison to control cells, the stiffness of the cells, measured by indenting the plasma membrane of the cells above the nucleus, decreased significantly after cells were squeezed through 7-\u03bcm microchannels. After 24 hours, we observed a gradual recovery of elastic modulus, indicating that the mechanical changes induced by a millisecond squeezing lasted for hours. Additionally, we examined nuclear shape change by DAPI staining, and found that the cell nucleus was more elongated after squeezing, which gradually recovered after 24 hours (Fig. S8 in Song et al.).",
                                "To determine whether microchannel-induced nuclear deformation had any effect on the direct conversion of fibroblasts into iN cells, adult mouse fibroblasts were transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral constructs containing the three reprogramming factors BAM as depicted in the timeline for the reprogramming experimental procedure (FIG. 2a in Song et al.). Two days later, Dox was added (designated as Day 0) to induce the expression of BAM transgenes and proteins within a few hours. To determine the timing of mechanical squeezing, before or after administering Dox, cells were introduced into microfluidic devices with 7-\u03bcm wide channels. Then the cells were collected and seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips and cultured in serum-free N2B27 medium (FIG. 2a in Song et al.). Seven days after induced mechanical deformation, cultures were fixed and stained for p-III tubulin (Tubb3) to determine the reprogramming efficiency. The reprogramming efficiency of cells going through 200-\u03bcm wide channels (as the control group) was not significantly different from the cells under static culture condition (Fig. S9 in Song et al.). Administering Dox at least 6 hours before subjecting the cells to nuclear deformation produced the highest reprogramming efficiency (\u02dc8-fold) compared with the cells passing through 200-\u03bcm channels (FIG. 2b in Song et al.). These results suggested that the presence of BAM proteins within the first few hours after squeezing was critical and that a transient nuclear deformation was sufficient to enhance the reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts into iN cells. In consistent with the effects of microchannel size on cell viability (FIG. 1f and Fig. S5 in Song et al.), microchannels smaller than 7-\u03bcm (i.e., 5 and 3-\u03bcm) decreased cell viability and thus compromised reprogramming efficiency, while 9-\u03bcm microchannels might not induce sufficient nuclear deformation and resulted in a lower reprogramming efficiency than 7-\u03bcm microchannels (FIG. 2c in Song et al.).",
                                "To determine whether nuclear deformation by microchannels facilitated the activation of endogenous neuronal genes, we monitored the effect of nuclear deformation on neuronal marker expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and live cell imaging. Among three transgenes, Ascl1 is a pioneer factor30,31, so we examined how mechanical squeezing affected Ascl1 transgene expression and the activation of endogenous Ascl1. While endogenous Ascl1 expression in the control group showed a very low basal level at 6 hours and a 2-fold increase at 12 hours, squeezing cells triggered 4.6-fold to 15.4-fold induction of endogenous Ascl1 expression between 6-12 hours and a 10.6-fold increase at 24 hours when compared with the control group (FIG. 2d in Song et al.). Furthermore, to directly monitor the temporal activation of endogenous Ascl1 protein, fibroblasts were transduced with an Ascl1 promoter driven-GFP (Ascl1-GFP) and subjected to reprogramming process. Consistently, we found a significant increase in the number of Ascl1-GFP+ cells at day 1 in the squeezed cells compared to the control (FIG. 2e in Song et al.). On the other hand, the transgene expression of Ascl1 showed a slight increase (<2 fold) within 24 hours after squeezing (Fig. S10a in Song et al.), and the overall gene expression of Brn2 and Myt1l had less than 2.5-fold increase (Fig. S10b-c in Song et al.).",
                                "We also monitored the expression of other neuronal markers such as Tubb3. We first used gold nanorod biosensors32 with complementary sequence to detect mRNA expression of Tubb3 in living cells. Tubb3 mRNA expression was detectable as early as 12 hours in squeezed cells but rarely in the control group (FIG. 2f and Fig. S11 in Song et al.). Consistently, qPCR analysis showed significantly higher Tubb3 expression in the squeezed cells than the control group after 12 hours following nuclear deformation (FIG. 2g in Song et al.). In addition, we performed reprogramming experiments by using fibroblasts isolated from transgenic mice expressing a EGFP reporter driven by the promoter of neuronal gene Tau. The number of Tau-GFP+ cells in the squeezed group at day 4 was \u02dc6 times greater than that in the control group (FIG. 2h in Song et al.). We then used Tuj1 staining (for Tubb3) and neuron morphology analysis to determine reprogramming efficiency at various time points. At 1 week and 2 weeks after nuclear deformation, the iN reprogramming efficiency was significantly higher in the mechanically squeezed group compared with the control (FIG. 2i and Fig. S12 in Song et al.). Further characterization of the derived cells revealed that iN cells expressed mature neuronal markers microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) and Synapsin at 4 weeks after nuclear deformation (FIG. 2j in Song et al.). The terminally differentiated neurons from the control and squeezed groups had similar morphology (Fig. S13 in Song et al.). After 6 weeks, iN cells resulting from mechanical squeezing treatment showed calcium fluctuations, indicating a mature neuronal phenotype (Supplementary movie S1 in Song et al.)33.",
                                "While nuclear deformation resulted in a modest transgene expression, which could also be achieved by increasing the titer of viral constructs, it could not fully account for the 8-fold induction of reprogramming efficiency. Therefore, we investigated the potential involvement of epigenetic changes that controls the on/off state of phenotypic genes. To investigate whether nuclear deformation-enhanced reprogramming efficiency was due to the changes in chromatin and epigenetic state, we first utilized a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor targeted at the nucleosome to monitor the levels of a heterochromatin mark H3K9me3. We found that H3K9me3 FRET signal significantly decreased in fibroblasts passing through 7-\u03bcm microchannels (FIG. 3a in Song et al.). To observe the temporal change in the same cells, we slowed down the squeezing process by lowering the pressure and flow rate in the microdevice. Cells passing through 200-\u03bcm channels did not show significant change in H3K9me3 FRET signal (Fig. S14 in Song et al.), whereas 7-\u03bcm microchannels decreased H3K9me3 FRET signal within 1 minute (Fig. S15 in Song et al.).",
                                "To determine whether the epigenetic changes persisted after squeezing and whether squeezing induced changes in other epigenetic marks, we performed immunostaining analysis of heterochromatin and euchromatin marks at multiple time points within the first 24 hours after cells passed through the microchannels. Consistently, we observed a significant decrease in H3K9me3 at 3 hours and 12 hours after nuclear deformation, which returned to the same level as the cells in the control group after 24 hours (FIG. 3b-c in Song et al.). Western blotting analysis also confirmed the global decrease of H3K9me3 induced by nuclear deformation (Fig. S16 in Song et al.). These results indicated that nuclear deformation resulted in a transient reduction of heterochromatin. In contrast, the levels of acetylated histone marks including AcH3 and H3K9ac, and histone methylation marks including H3K4me1, H4K20me3 and H3K27me3 did not show significant global changes in response to forced nuclear deformation (Fig. S17 in Song et al.). Western blotting analysis further confirmed that heterochromatin mark H3K27me3 did not show significant changes after squeezing, although H3K27me3 was inhibited by its inhibitor EED226 (Fig. S18 in Song et al.).",
                                "In addition to histone modifications, DNA methylation influences chromatin organization, which is critical for cell reprogramming34. To investigate the effect of nuclear deformation on DNA methylation, we analyzed DNA condensation and the level of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), a DNA methylation marker, in fibroblasts squeezed by microchannels. As shown in FIG. 3d-f in Song et al., both immunostaining analysis and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) (Fig. S19 in Song et al. shows a standard curve) showed that nuclear deformation significantly decreased DNA methylation for at least 12 hours. These results indicated that nuclear deformation caused chromatin modifications in both H3K9me3 and 5-mc.",
                                "To test whether the decrease in H3K9me3 played a role in iN conversion, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were treated with a H3K9-specific histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor (Bix01294) for 24 hours. The inhibitor specifically suppressed H3K9me3 in a dose-dependent manner, and we selected a concentration of Bix01294 (1 \u03bcM) that did not affect cell viability (Fig. S20-22 in Song et al.). As shown in FIG. 3g in Song et al., Bix01294 partially mimicked the squeezing effect on the reprogramming efficiency. Additionally, pre-treatment with Bix01294, together with mechanical deformation, slightly increased the reprogramming efficiency compared to the squeezed-only group (FIG. 3g in Song et al.), suggesting that a 24-hour HMT inhibition by Bix01294 only led to a marginal enhancement. Furthermore, to determine whether the decrease of H3K9me3 was required for nuclear deformation-induced iN reprogramming, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were pre-treated with JIB-04 (100 nM), a H3K9 specific histone demethylase (HDMT) inhibitor, for 24 hours before being introduced into the microdevice. JIB-04, which significantly increased H3K9me3 (Fig. S20 in Song et al.), not only reduced the reprogramming efficiency compared to the control, but also strikingly suppressed nuclear deformation-induced iN reprogramming (FIG. 3h in Song et al.). Additionally, in fibroblasts pre-treated with JIB-04 for 24 hours and then introduced into the 7-\u03bcm channels, the decrease of H3K9me3 by squeezing was much less than the group without JIB-04 treatment (Fig. S23 and S24 in Song et al.). These results suggest that the decrease in H3K9me3 levels was required for the mechanical squeezing effect on iN reprogramming, which might be mediated by HDMTs. On the other hand, pre-treatment with the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, Decitabine (0.5 \u03bcM) (Fig. S20 and S25 in Song et al.), slightly enhanced iN reprogramming efficiency, and the pre-treatment with Decitabine before squeezing further enhanced squeezing-induced iN reprogramming (FIG. 3i in Song et al.), demonstrating that DNA demethylation also played a role in iN reprogramming.",
                                "To investigate whether the combined effects of suppressing H3K9me3 and DNA methylation could match the reprogramming efficiency induced by mechanical squeezing, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were either subjected to transient nuclear deformation or treated with different combinations and concentrations of Decitabine and Bix01294. As shown in Fig. S26 and S27, in Song et al. Bix01294 or Decitabine alone, at its optimal concentration, only increased iN conversion by about 2-fold. Interestingly, 0.2 \u03bcM Decitabine combined with 0.4 \u03bcM Bix01294 (1:2) significantly increased the iN reprogramming efficiency in comparison to other combinations tested and showed similar efficiency when compared with the mechanically squeezed group (FIG. 3j in Song et al.), suggesting that the suppression of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation may be the major mediators of microchannel-induced iN reprogramming efficiency.",
                                "We further investigated whether ion channels were involved in squeezing-induced mechanotransduction leading to improved reprogramming efficiency. As shown in Fig. S28-33 in Song et al., the inhibition of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ion channels and the manipulation of extracellular pH during the squeezing process did not significantly affect the iN reprogramming efficiency.",
                                "The observations that mechanical squeezing forced nuclear deformation and a decrease in the Young's modulus of the cells suggested that the structural changes of the nucleus could mediate mechanotransduction through the nuclear lamina. Indeed, lamin A/C staining showed that nuclear deformation by 7-\u03bcm microchannels induced a transient increase in nuclear wrinkling that lasted for at least 12 hours (FIG. 4a-b in Song et al.), more than that in cells passing through 200-\u03bcm channels (Fig. S34 in Song et al.). In addition, mechanical squeezing by 7-\u03bcm microchannels caused a transient decrease in lamin A/C assembly at the nuclear periphery (FIG. 4c in Song et al.) and a slight shift of lamin A/C to nucleoplasm within 3 hours (Fig. S35 in Song et al.). This increase in nucleoplasmic lamin A/C after mechanical squeezing might be attributed, at least in part, to changes in lamin A/C phosphorylation35 as we observed a slight increase in phosphorylated lamin A/C at 30 minutes after mechanical squeezing (Fig. S36 in Song et al.). On the other hand, mechanical squeezing had no significant effect on the total protein levels of lamin A/C and lamin B1 (Fig. S36 in Song et al.). Interestingly, lamin B1 did not show a complete co-localization with lamin A/C following squeezing, especially within blebbing regions induced by 5-\u03bcm microchannels (Fig. S37 in Song et al.), and lamin B1 assembly at the nuclear periphery was not significantly affected by mechanical squeezing using 7-\u25a1m microchannels as lamin A/C (Fig. S38-39 in Song et al.). This finding is consistent with the reports that lamin A/C and lamin B1 form different structural layers36 and that lamin A/C but lamin B1 regulates nuclear mechanics37.",
                                "We further examined the changes of H3K9me3 and 5-mC in relation with lamin A/C following squeezing, and showed that the decrease of lamin A/C at nuclear periphery was accompanied by the decrease of H3K9me3 and 5-mc (Fig. S40, FIG. 3a-f, FIG. 4c in Song et al.). In addition, we examined the co-localization of the nuclear lamina and lamina-associated domains (LADs), which are enriched in heterochromatin (e.g. H3K9me3) and anchor chromatins to the nuclear lamina38,39. We used a m6A-Tracer GFP reporter to label LADs40, and used lamin B1 to label nuclear lamina as its distribution at nuclear periphery did not change significantly following squeezing (Fig. S38-39 in Song et al.). As shown in FIG. 4d and Fig. S41 in Song et al., after cells passed through 7-\u03bcm microchannels, part of the m6A-Tracer GFP signal was dislodged from the nuclear periphery, suggesting that a partial detachment between LADs and the nuclear lamina had occurred.",
                                "To investigate whether lamin disruption mediated nuclear deformation-induced epigenetic changes during iN reprogramming, we silenced lamin A/C by using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) in BAM-transduced fibroblasts 24 hours prior to mechanical squeezing (Fig. S42-S43 in Song et al.). As shown in FIG. 4e in Song et al., lamin A/C knockdown mimicked the effects of mechanical squeezing, which caused a lamin disassembly at nuclear periphery and a decrease in H3K9me3 and 5-mC (FIG. 4f, g in Song et al.). Moreover, lamin A/C knockdown enhanced the iN reprogramming efficiency of non-deformed cells to an extent similar to the cells that were mechanically squeezed but lamin A/C was not silenced (FIG. 4h in Song et al.). The iN cells derived after lamin A/C knockdown expressed MAP2 and Synapsin at 4 weeks after mechanical deformation (Fig. S44 in Song et al.). Taken together, these results suggested that lamin A/C played an important role in regulating the demethylation of histone and DNA induced by forced nuclear deformation.",
                                "To determine whether microfluidic device-induced nuclear deformation could regulate the reprogramming of different cell types, we performed similar experiments by using macrophages transduced with BAM and fibroblasts transduced with Oct-4, Sox 2, KLF-4, and c-Myc (OSKM), respectively. Interestingly, we found that both iN reprogramming from macrophages and iPSC reprogramming from fibroblasts were significantly enhanced after nuclear deformation (FIG. 5a-b in Song et al.), suggesting that mechanical reprogramming can be utilized as a general approach to prime the epigenetic state of cells to promote cell reprogramming.",
                                "To scale up the mechano-preconditioning of cells for reprogramming, we developed a higher-throughput microfluidic device (HMD) containing 10 times more microchannels (400 microchannels) than the original microfluidic device (OMD) with 36 microchannels (FIG. 5c in Song et al.). The design was validated by fluid flow simulation, showing the velocity profile in different sizes of channels in the devices (Fig. S45 in Song et al.). HMD allowed the mechanical processing and collection of 10,000 cells within a minute, which was 5 times faster than OMD. Compared with OMD, this HMD significantly increased the yield of cell collection (FIG. 5d in Song et al.); HMD also maintained high cell viability and significantly improved iN efficiency (FIG. 5e-f in Song et al.).",

The following day (day 0) the medium was changed to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) medium containing doxycycline (2 ng/ml, Sigma) to initiate the expression of the transgenes and thus, reprogramming. After 6 hours, transduced fibroblasts were passaged, and either subjected to microfluidic deformation using microchannels of various widths. Cells were then seeded onto glass slides coated with 0.1 mg/mL fibronectin (ThermoFisher, 33016015) overnight at a density of 3,000 cells/cm2.

                                "In this study, we demonstrate that the transient nuclear deformation in suspended cells decreases the methylation of H3K9me3 and DNA (5-mC), which primes the chromatin to a more permissive epigenetic state for reprogramming. This phenomenon is independent of complex microenvironmental factors such as extracellular matrix, cell-cell adhesions and pH, and may be generalized to various cell types as we have shown for fibroblasts and macrophages. It is important to note that this millisecond mechanical perturbation induces a transient change in epigenetic state within a 24-hour time window, allowing an earlier and more efficient activation of neuronal genes in heterochromatin, with global heterochromatin marks returning to the basal level afterwards.",
                                "Mechanical squeezing can increase the efficiency of reprogramming adult fibroblasts into iN cells (to \u02dc20%), which is much higher than using transgenes alone (2-3%), suggesting that mechanical factors can help overcome the epigenetic barrier during the reprogramming process 9. It is worth noting that, although the combination of chemical inhibitors for H3K9 and DNA methylation may reach the same iN efficiency as mechanical squeezing, the chemical inhibitors require hours of treatment and induce significant DNA damage (\u02dc17% cells), while mechanical squeezing causes low DNA damage (\u02dc3%), and in contrast, promoted cell proliferation (Fig. S46-S47 in Song et al.). In addition, squeezing did not significantly affect the activities of HMTs and DNMTs as compared with the chemicals (Fig. S48 in Song et al.), suggesting that this mechanical squeezing modulates H3K9me3 and 5-mc through different mechanisms. Furthermore, although mechanical squeezing did not induce a global change in AcH3 (Fig. S17 in Song et al.), the specific inhibition of histone deacetylase by valproic acid (VPA) slightly increased iN reprogramming efficiency, which was additive to mechanical squeezing (Fig. S49-51 in Song et al.), suggesting that the enhancement of an open-chromatin state may further facilitate iN reprogramming. Additionally, we found that squeezing did not promote chemical-induced iN reprogramming (Fig. S52 in Song et al.) via small molecule compounds (Forskolin, ISX-9, CHIR99021 and IBET-151)41, which may be explained by the fact that chemical-induced reprogramming process requires a complex signaling network to activate neuronal genes and different kinetics and time period for epigenetic modulations; in contrast, squeezing provides a 24-hour time window with a suppression of heterochromatin to enhance the bindings of reprogramming transcriptional factors to activate endogenous neuronal genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that squeezing provides some advantages over chemicals and may regulate chromatin organization differently than chemicals.",
                                "FRET experiments show that nuclear deformation downregulates H3K9me3 within minutes, which is accompanied by nuclear wrinkling, lamin A/C disassembly at nuclear periphery and a decrease in cell stiffness. This is consistent with an earlier observation during cell mitosis42. Knocking down lamin A/C mimics the effects of mechanical squeezing, suggesting that the nuclear lamina plays an important role in this mechanotransduction process. Indeed, heterochromatin is anchored to nuclear lamina through LADs that are abundant for heterochromatin marks such as H3K9me3 and are repressive for gene expression38,43,44. Mechanical force-induced nuclear deformation may partially induce nuclear lamina reorganization, wrinkling, lamin A/C disassembly at nuclear periphery (FIG. 4c and Fig. S35 in Song et al.) and a partial detachment of heterochromatin from the nuclear lamina (FIG. 4d and Fig. S41 in Song et al.), which relocates heterochromatin towards the interior of the nucleus, accompanied by the downregulation of heterochromatin marks. This transient biophysical modulation of epigenetic state appears to be universal and independent of cell type and reprogramming factors, as squeezing macrophages also enhances their reprogramming into neurons and transient nuclear deformation promotes fibroblast reprogramming into iPSCs.",
                                "The simplicity of this mechanical approach by squeezing suspended cells provides direct evidence on the effect of nuclear deformation on chromatin remodeling. We also examined the roles of other major mediators of mechanotransduction45,46 and showed that YAP and Piezo-1 did not play a major role in mediating microchannel-induced epigenetic changes and iN reprogramming. Yap translocation into nucleus upon cell adhesion was not affected by the squeezing process (Fig. S53 in Song et al.). In addition, the knockdown of Piezo-1 by siRNA had a negligible effect on various histone marks including H3K9me3, H3K27me3, AcH3, H3K27ac and 5-mC (Fig. S54-S56 in Song et al.), but slightly decreased the microchannel-induced iN reprogramming efficiency (Fig. S57 in Song et al.), suggesting that Piezo-1 may contribute to iN reprogramming independent of epigenetic modulation.",
                                "The transient nuclear deformation in suspended cells is distinctly different from cell culture models because this approach decouples nuclear deformation from various cellular structures in adherent cells and the mechanical loading is transient and active. For example, passive biophysical factors such as micro/nano topography and matrix stiffness not only cause nuclear deformation, but also induce changes in cell adhesions and cytoskeleton organization that affect many other cellular processes. Active mechanical loading such as magnetic twisting on the surface of adherent cells, although can regulate gene expression in euchromatin, appears insufficient to overcome the heterochromatin barrier47, which could be explained by the lack of significant nuclear deformation and/or global chromatin reorganization. Stretching or compressing adherent cells may decrease or increase heterochromatin21-23, and these different effects could be related to the different magnitudes and rates of nuclear perturbation by these mechanical stimuli and other confounding factors such as cell adhesions and polarity.",
                                "Another highlight of this work is the translation of mechanobiology findings into mechano-biotechnology for cell engineering. Microfabricated devices provide a well-controlled microenvironment and real-time process control with a minimal benchtop space requirement48. Here we developed a scalable microfluidic device that can be used to continuously process and precondition cells. This microfluidic device with multiple constriction channels can be used to engineer a variety of cells such as fibroblasts, stem cells and immune cells, and to facilitate the conversion of cell types from one to another, which will have broad applications in regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug screening.",

                                "The role of transcription factors and biomolecules in cell type conversion has been widely studied. Yet, it remains unclear whether and how intracellular mechanotransduction through focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton regulates the epigenetic state and cell reprogramming. Here, we show that cytoskeletal structures and the mechanical properties of cells are modulated during the early phase of induced neuronal (iN) reprogramming, with an increase in actin cytoskeleton assembly induced by Ascl1 transgene. The reduction of actin cytoskeletal tension or cell adhesion at the early phase of reprogramming suppresses the expression of mesenchymal genes, promotes a more open chromatin structure, and significantly enhances the efficiency of iN conversion. Specifically, reduction of intracellular tension or cell adhesion not only modulates global epigenetic marks, but also decreases DNA methylation and heterochromatin marks and increases euchromatin marks at the promoter of neuronal genes, thus enhancing the accessibility for gene activation. Finally, micro and nano topographic surfaces that reduce cell adhesions enhance iN reprogramming. These novel findings suggest that the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions play an important role in epigenetic regulation for cell fate determination, which may lead to novel engineering approaches for cell reprogramming.",
                                "Cell reprogramming enables the derivation of distinct cell types that are highly valuable for regenerative cell therapy, disease modeling and therapeutic discovery1,2. Direct cell conversion provides a faster and more direct method of generating desired cell types from somatic cells3,4. Previous studies have demonstrated that fibroblasts can be directly converted into other cell types such as neurons5,6 and cardiomyocytes7 by using transcription factors, microRNAs and biophysical factors8-11. However, low conversion efficiency has limited the translation of direct reprogramming strategies for therapeutic purposes. In addition, the role of mechanotransduction through intracellular structures such as actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions (FAs), during direct reprogramming, is poorly understood.",
                                "Increasing evidence indicates that FAs and the cytoskeleton play important roles in sensing and transducing extracellular biophysical signals to modulate intracellular signaling and cell functions12-14. FAs are large, multiprotein complexes that provide a physical link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeleton. FAs can be modulated by biochemical and biophysical cues in the cellular microenvironment, and activate signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal organization in response to mechanical cues12,15. In eukaryotic cells, the cytoskeleton, primarily composed of actin microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules, spans the cytoplasm to provide a structural link between the cell nucleus and the ECM. It serves to spatially organize contents of the cell and facilitates cell movement and shape changes through the generation of forces16. These intracellular structures have been implicated in regulating the mechanical phenotype of cells during many physiological and disease processes17-19 Additionally, there is evidence that the physical coupling of the cell nucleus with the cytoskeleton can affect chromatin structure and regulate the epigenetic state, gene expression and cell function20,21. Yet, how intracellular structures, such as the actin cytoskeleton and FAs, regulate direct cell reprogramming is still unclear. Furthermore, whether these intracellular structures modulate the epigenetic state to influence direct cell conversion remains unknown.",
                                "Here we investigated the role of intracellular tension transmitted through the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion in cell reprogramming using the conversion of fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells5 as a model. Our results demonstrate that the reduction of intracellular tension in the early phase of the reprogramming can enhance the efficiency of iN conversion by promoting a more open chromatin structure to facilitate the activation of neuronal genes.",

                                "**Intracellular Structures and Mechanical Properties of Cells are Modulated During the Early Phase of iN Reprogramming**",
                                "To elucidate the role of the various intracellular structures during iN conversion, primary fibroblasts isolated from adult mice were transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors encoding three key reprogramming factors, Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l (BAM), and seeded onto tissue culture polystyrene dishes coated with laminin the following day. As illustrated in FIG. 1A, Dox was added one day later (marked as day 0) to initiate the expression of the transgenes and cells were cultured in neuronal medium (i.e., N3 medium) from day 1 to the conclusion of the experiment. To gain insights into the morphological changes that fibroblasts undergo as they reprogram into neurons, we first examined how the actin cytoskeleton was altered during the early phase of iN reprogramming. Interestingly, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that by day 1 of the reprogramming process, actin assembled into a network with a cage-like structure around the nucleus, but this structure along with the majority of the cytoskeleton gradually disappeared by day 3 (FIG. 1B). To determine whether these structural changes resulted in differences in the mechanical phenotype of cells, the mechanical properties of BAM-transduced fibroblasts was measured at similar time points using high-throughput quantitative deformability cytometry (q-DC), in which the timescale of a cell to transit through a narrow constriction provides a metric for cell deformability. We found that cell transit time and stiffness increased by day 1 and was followed by a decrease on day 3, which coincided with the observed cytoskeletal changes (FIG. 1C-D). Utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure cell stiffness yielded a similar trend, consistent with our q-DC findings, and demonstrated more profound differences in cell stiffness across the various time points (FIG. 1E). These changes in cellular mechanical properties were transgene-specific as transduction with green fluorescent protein (GFP) did not produce a similar effect (FIG. 1E). These results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton and mechanical properties of cells are modulated during the early phase of reprogramming, possibly playing a role in iN conversion.",
                                "**Ascl1 Plays a Dominant Role in Regulating the Cell Mechanical Phenotype Changes**",
                                "Next, we sought to determine the transgene that was responsible for the observed changes in the cytoskeleton and mechanical phenotype by reprogramming fibroblasts with individual or various combinations of the transgenes. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of cytoskeletal structures and focal adhesion proteins demonstrated that Ascl1 promoted the actin cage-like structure and paxillin expression at day 1 (FIG. 2A). Although less intact stress fibers were observed at day 3, paxillin expression remained high (FIG. 2A). On the other hand, the presence of paxillin-positive punctate and cell spreading appeared to decrease in BM- and BAM-transduced fibroblasts (FIG. 2A). Interestingly, AFM analysis revealed that Ascl1 was the critical transgene in modulating the mechanical phenotype of cells in the early phase of reprogramming as it induced changes in cell stiffness in a manner comparable to BAM (FIG. 2B). To elucidate whether these observations could extend to the transcript level, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of non-transduced and Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts on day 3. We found that the overexpression of Ascl1 led to the over-representation of genes in gene ontology (GO) categories related to the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, such as actin cytoskeleton organization and actin-mediated cell contraction (FIG. 2C). Altogether, these results suggested that the increase in cytoskeleton assembly at the early phase of reprogramming could be attributed to Ascl1-induced expression of cytoskeletal proteins.",
                                "**Reduction of Cytoskeletal Tension Enhances iN Reprogramming**",
                                "To examine whether these changes in cell stiffness, actin structure and expression of contractility-mediating genes were involved in iN reprogramming, we evaluated the effects of disrupting the cytoskeleton using small molecule inhibitors. For these experiments, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were reprogrammed as in FIG. 1A and chemical compounds known to perturb the cytoskeleton were added to the culture medium on day 1 to evaluate their effects on the reprogramming process. After 2 weeks, cultures were fixed and immunostained for neuronal 3-III tubulin (TUBB3). iN cells were identified based on displays of a typical neuronal morphology (defined as cells with a circular soma extending processes that are at least three times the length of the cell body) and positive TUBB3 expression. The reprogramming efficiency was determined as the percentage of TUBB3*-iN cells normalized to the number of cells plated at 24 hours post-seeding (i.e., day 0). First, we tested whether disruption of cytoskeletal contractility could influence the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into neurons using blebbistatin, a non-muscle myosin II inhibitor22-24. We observed that iN cells could be derived in the absence and presence of blebbistatin (FIG. 3A). Interestingly, when fibroblasts were induced to reprogram in the presence of varying concentrations of blebbistatin, we observed a biphasic dose response, suggesting that the reduction of intracellular tension to an optimal level may promote iN conversion (FIG. 3B). In particular, treatment with 10 \u03bcM blebbistatin generated the highest number of iN cells and increased the reprogramming efficiency by approximately 4.5-fold compared to the control, therefore, this concentration was used in all subsequent experiments. This enhanced reprogramming efficiency by blebbistatin was also confirmed by using mouse fibroblasts isolated from Tau-EGFP mice, whereby cells expressing the neuronal marker, Tau, are concomitantly labeled with GFP. As Ascl1 has been identified as a pioneer factor for iN reprogramming and transduction of Ascl1 alone is sufficient to generate iN cells25,26, we further investigated whether blebbistatin could influence iN conversion by Ascl1 induction. Remarkably, we found that blebbistatin treatment could generate significantly more iN cells from Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts relative to control (FIG. 3C), suggesting that inhibition of cell contractility could promote single-factor reprogramming.",
                                "To determine whether interference of other cytoskeletal structures that can regulate intracellular tension affected iN conversion, we examined the effects of other chemical inhibitors, including Y-27632 (a Rho-kinase inhibitor to prevent stress fiber formation and contraction)27, nocodazole (disrupting the assembly and disassembly dynamics of microtubules)28, jasplakinolide (stabilizing actin filaments)12, and cytochalasin D (inhibiting F-actin polymerization). Consistently, inhibition Rho-kinase increased the yield of iN cells similar to blebbistatin, although to a lesser degree (FIG. 3D); in contrast, treatment with nocodazole, which compromised cell division and other functions, resulted in a reduction in the reprogramming efficiency (FIG. 3E). Moreover, treatment with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D reduced the reprogramming efficiency relative to control (FIG. 3F), suggesting that maintaining a certain level of actin cytoskeleton might be required for iN reprogramming.",
                                "Next, we determined the minimum length of time necessary for the inhibitor to elicit an effect by reprogramming fibroblasts in the absence and presence of blebbistatin over timescales of 1 to 14 days. Surprisingly, we found that administering blebbistatin for the first 3 days was sufficient to enhance the reprogramming efficiency, suggesting that relaxation of intracellular tension might facilitate initiation of the reprogramming process. Indeed, treatment with blebbistatin during distinct phases, i.e., early [days 1-5], mid [day 5-9], and late [day 9-13] stages of reprogramming demonstrated that the effects of cytoskeletal disruption were most crucial during the early phase of reprogramming (FIG. 3G). Additionally, time course studies of the reprogramming process revealed that as early as day 5, blebbistatin treatment led to more efficient generation of TUBB3+ iN cells than the control, and this trend was evident throughout a longer time period.",
                                "To ensure that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension at the early stage of reprogramming did not affect neuronal properties, we assessed the maturation and functionality of the iN cells derived in the absence and presence of blebbistatin. Immunostaining analysis for mature neuronal markers revealed that iN cells expressed NeuN, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and synapsin (FIG. 3H). Similar observations were found in Tau-EGFP-derived iN cells. Electrophysiological analysis indicated that the iN cells were functional, exhibiting spontaneous changes in membrane potential in response to current injection (FIG. 3I). Further analysis of several action potential properties showed no apparent difference for iN cells generated in the absence and presence of blebbistatin. Although there was no significant difference in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), the EPSC amplitude was significantly higher in iN cells derived with blebbistatin. Similarly, we observed no significant difference in spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs) frequency, however, the amplitude of IPSC was significantly lower in blebbistatin-derived iN cells. Furthermore, iN cells were found to be of the GABAergic and glutamatergic subtypes, in agreement with a previous report5. Collectively, these results suggest that iN cells derived with reduced myosin II activity still show signs of being mature and functional.",

                                "To gain insights into the mechanism by which disruption of cell contractility enhanced the reprogramming efficiency, we first examined the effects of blebbistatin on cell morphology. We observed that blebbistatin induced dramatic changes in cell morphology and reduced cell spreading in fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin for 24 hours (FIG. 4A). In addition, there appeared to be fewer intact actin fibers in fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin. Upon observing that cell spreading was affected, immunostaining analysis of focal adhesion proteins showed there were fewer positive paxillin punctate in blebbistatin-treated cells, suggesting that cytoskeletal disruption may modulate focal adhesion assembly and, as a result, cell adhesion (FIG. 4A).",
                                "It has been proposed that cell reprogramming involves the suppression of the original cell phenotype and the activation of the target cell fate regulatory program29 Thus, we investigated whether blebbistatin's mechanism of action involved the repression of the mesenchymal phenotype in fibroblasts. To test this, non-transduced fibroblasts were cultured with and without blebbistatin for 24 or 48 hours, respectively, followed by analysis of mesenchymal marker expression. Interestingly, we observed less calponin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive cells after blebbistatin treatment and that the expression for both markers had decreased at the gene and protein level by day 3 (FIG. 4B-D). Similarly, this trend was evident in BAM-transduced fibroblasts (FIG. 4C, D). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis also showed that blebbistatin downregulated the expression of other mesenchymal and fibroblast-associated genes, Eln and DCN, in non- and BAM-transduced fibroblasts.",
                                "Subsequently, we explored the effect of cytoskeletal disruption on the induction of the neuronal phenotype by performing qRT-PCR analysis to evaluate neuronal gene expression at day 5. We found that the expression of various neuronal genes, including the key reprogramming factors, were significantly increased in BAM-transduced fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin, as compared to the non-treated transduced cells (FIG. 4E). To determine whether blebbistatin influenced the expression of the transgenes at an earlier time point, we analyzed the expression of BAM at day 3. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Ascl1 expression was upregulated by blebbistatin at day 3. On the contrary, Brn2 and Myt1l did not show such a drastic increase in the expression level, suggesting that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension may enhance iN conversion efficiency by modulating Ascl1 expression. Considering two additional transcription factors along with Ascl1 are included in the reprogramming cocktail to generate iN cells, we questioned if perhaps blebbistatin could induce the expression of Brn2 and Myt1l to promote single factor reprogramming. Utilizing qRT-PCR to analyze the changes in neuronal gene expression in Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts, we found that blebbistatin upregulated the expression of endogenous Brn2 and Myt1l. Moreover, the expression of several neuronal genes, including the master neuronal gene, NeuroD1, was also higher in Ascl1-transduced fibroblasts treated with blebbistatin. In short, reduction of intracellular tension may influence iN conversion by inducing cell morphological changes that could impact nuclear morphology and thus, chromatin architecture and gene expression.",

                                "As cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression and drastic chromatin remodeling during iPSC reprogramming30,31, we postulated that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension might alter the epigenetic state to promote iN conversion. Therefore, to determine the effect of cytoskeletal modulation on global chromatin organization, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of histone marks associated with open chromatin structure (i.e. histone H3 acetylation (AcH3), tri-methylated histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and mono-methylated histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me1)) and indicative of heterochromatin (i.e. tri-methylated histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), tri-methylated histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3)) in non-transduced fibroblasts cultured with and without blebbistatin. As shown in FIG. 5A, interestingly, blebbistatin-treated cells exhibited an increase in AcH3, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1 marks while heterochromatin marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 decreased, compared to control, suggesting that inhibition of cytoskeletal contractility can induce global epigenetic changes and furthermore, may promote a more open chromatin structure. Similar histone trends were observed in fibroblasts treated with the Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) but no other cytoskeletal disrupting compounds (i.e., nocodazole, cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide), suggesting that these histone changes might be attributed to changes in cytoskeletal tension.",
                                "Analysis of chromatin-modifying enzyme activity showed that blebbistatin treatment increased histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity while reducing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (FIG. 5B-C), which could potentially lead to an increase in histone H3 acetylation and thus, gene activation. In addition, blebbistatin treatment increased the activity of H3K4-specific histone methyltransferase (HMT) and reduced histone demethylase (HDM) activity, thereby possibly promoting H3K4 methylation (FIG. 5D-E).",
                                "To directly determine whether intracellular tension reduction could alter chromatin accessibility at specific sites of chromatin, we performed the assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and found that blebbistatin treatment, indeed, could increase the accessibility at the promoter or enhancer regions of neuronal genes, including Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l and Tubb3 (FIG. 5F). Interestingly, the reduction of cytoskeletal tension slightly decreased the accessibility at the promoters or enhancer regions of some mesenchymal genes. To elucidate whether the observed epigenetic changes in active chromatin marks were involved in regulating neuronal gene expression during iN reprogramming, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assay at the promoter regions of Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l, and TUBB3. ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed significant increases in AcH3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at all four promoter regions in blebbistatin-treated cells relative to DMSO (FIG. 5G). Further examination of other epigenetic mechanisms that may be affected by inhibition of intracelullar tension revealed a decrease in the abundance of DNA methylation marker, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), in blebbistatin-treated cells relative to the control (FIG. 5H-I). These findings were consistent with a decrease in DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity after blebbistatin treatment (FIG. 5J). Altogether, these results suggest that cytoskeletal disruption can reduce DNA methylation and promote global and site-specific changes in histone H3 acetylation and methylation that are conducive for neuronal gene activation.",

                                "We then explored the modulation of intracellular tension via cell-ECM adhesions. Specifically, we examined the role of focal adhesion signaling by blocking the activity with the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor, PF573228. Western blot analysis showed that PF573228 inhibited the phosphorylation of FAK (pFAK) at Tyrosine 397 (Tyr-397) in a dose-dependent manner and in addition, modulated downstream ERK signaling, demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitor. Immunostaining analysis also confirmed that PF573228 reduced pFAK expression in fibroblasts. Thereafter, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were induced to reprogram in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of PF573228 to test the effects of FAK inhibition on iN conversion. Interestingly, FAK inhibition significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency in a biphasic manner, similar to blebbistatin treatment, suggesting that a reduction of focal adhesions to an optimal level may facilitate iN conversion (FIG. 6A). Although FAK inhibition via PF573228 may influence ERK signaling, we found that the conversion efficiency was not significantly altered when BAM-transduced fibroblasts were treated with various doses of the ERK inhibitor, U0126, suggesting that the inhibition of FAK signaling, rather than ERK, plays a pivotal role in regulating iN reprogramming. Further characterization of the iN cells derived in absence and presence of the FAK inhibitor showed that these cells expressed neuronal markers, including NeuN, MAP2, and synapsin, and exhibited functional neuronal properties as assessed by electrophysiological analysis (FIG. 6B-C).",
                                "We further examined whether FAK inhibition could modulate mesenchymal and neuronal marker expression during iN conversion. Indeed, we found that calponin and \u03b1SMA expression decreased in BAM-transduced fibroblasts that were treated with PF573228 for 2 days (FIG. 6D). Conversely, neuronal gene expression was greater in fibroblasts transduced with BAM and cultured in the presence of 5 \u03bcM PF573228 at day 5, relative to the control (FIG. 6E). As with the reduction of intracellular tension, perturbations of cell adhesions also modulated the epigenetic state. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that fibroblasts treated with the FAK inhibitor exhibited global increases in AcH3, H3K3me3 and H3K4me1 marks and a concurrent decrease in H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 compared to the control cells (FIG. 7A), which coincided with differences in HAT, HDAC, H3K4-specific HMT and H3K4-specific HDM activity (FIG. 7B-E). ATAC-seq analysis further revealed that FAK inhibition could increase the accessibility at the promoter or enhancer regions of neuronal genes Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l and Tubb3 (FIG. 7F) and slightly decrease the accessibility of mesenchymal genes. These changes correlated well with localized site-specific epigenetic changes as ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed significant increases in AcH3, H3K3me3 and H3K4me1 at the promoter regions of Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1 and TUBB3 in PF573228-treated cells relative to DMSO (FIG. 7G). In addition, non-transduced fibroblasts treated with the FAK inhibitor for 24 hours displayed lower levels of DNA methylation, similar to blebbistatin treatment, as shown by a reduction in 5-mC marks and DNMT activity (FIG. 7H-J). These results demonstrate that a lower level of FAK enhances global and local epigenetic changes to promote iN reprogramming.",

                                "Given we had observed that reduction of intracellular tension and cell adhesion improved iN reprogramming, we postulated that modulating cell adhesion using biomaterials would produce a similar effect. When fibroblasts were grown on tissue-culture (TC) polystyrene wells or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes with a flat surface or 10-\u03bcm microgrooves, we observed a decrease in stress fibers and phosphorylated FAK on PDMS membranes relative to TC wells, with the lowest levels on 10-\u03bcm microgrooves (FIG. 8A). Consistently, the iN reprogramming efficiency correlated inversely with stress fibers and FAK phosphorylation (FIG. 8B). In another example, when fibroblasts were cultured on binary colloidal crystals (BCCs) composed of spherical particle materials with distinct silica microparticle sizes (i.e., 5 \u03bcm versus 2 \u03bcm), we observed less cell spreading and paxillin-positive punctate in fibroblasts cultured on 2 \u03bcm BCCs, which coincided with an increase in the reprogramming efficiency (FIG. 8C-E). These findings demonstrate the potential of engineering biomaterials to modulate cell adhesion and thus, intracellular tension to enhance iN reprogramming.",

                                "Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a reduction of cytoskeletal tension to an optimal level by using small molecule compounds, FAK inhibition and material engineering promotes a more open chromatin structure and enhances cell reprogramming. In particular, the reduction of cytoskeletal tension can suppress heterochromatin marks, and increase AcH3 and H3K4 methylation globally and at the promoter of neuronal genes (FIGS. 5 and 7), which in turn facilitates the reprogramming process. It is important to note that this reduction of tension is only required in the early phase of the reprogramming process (3-5 days, FIG. 3), suggesting that modulation of the epigenetic state is critical for initiating the reprogramming process but not necessarily for the maturation of neuronal phenotype. Interestingly, in comparison to blebbistatin, other actin and microtubule modulators such as cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide and nocodazole have opposite effects, i.e., decreasing euchromatin marks (e.g., AcH3) and inhibiting iN conversion (FIG. 3). While jasplakinolide enhances actin polymerization and nocodazole induces stress fibers, cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymerization. Therefore, these findings are consistent with the notion that a reduction of intracellular tension to an optimal level without compromising essential cell functions can promote epigenetic changes and cell reprogramming.",
                                "Our results suggest that intracellular tension regulates the epigenetic state through nuclear enzyme activities such as the increase of nuclear HAT and H3K4 HMT activity and the decrease in nuclear activity of HDAC and H3K4 HDM (FIGS. 5 and 7). One potential mechanism is the translocation of these enzymes between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Indeed, cytoskeleton tension can affect nuclear transport32. In addition, we show that the reduction of cytoskeletal tension causes the wrinkling and partial disassembly of nuclear lamina but does not induce a detachment of lamina-associated domain (LAD) of chromatin from the nuclear lamina. How these nuclear lamina changes regulate the transport of epigenetic enzyme activities remains to be determined. Furthermore, reducing intracellular tension suppresses the expression of mesenchymal genes in euchromatin (FIGS. 4 and 6), which may be attributed to both the decrease of accessibility at promoter and enhancer regions and the translocation of transcriptional factors3334. It is worth noting that mechanotransduction mechanisms in adherent cells may differ from cells being deformed in suspension. Cells in suspension have low-to-none intracellular tension, and transient squeezing has a direct physical effect on the nucleus such as the partial disruption of the nuclear lamina and LAD association, which causes a decrease in heterochromatin marks including H3K9me3 and DNA methylation11.",
                                "Cytoskeletal tension can be modulated by cell adhesions and ECM. Since focal adhesions can transmit forces outside-in or inside-out between ECM and intracellular actin cytoskeleton, this represents an exciting opportunity to boost cell reprogramming by engineering the properties of cell adhesive substrates such as ligand density, stiffness and micro/nanotopography35-41. Indeed, our results indicate that a reduction in cell spreading and focal adhesion signaling using micro/nano materials can facilitate the reprogramming process (FIG. 8). Taken together, our findings provide a potential explanation of the mechanotransduction mechanism by which cytoskeletal tension and cell adhesion can modulate reprogramming, and a rational basis for the design of novel biomaterials with biophysical properties that can be altered to provide an optimal level of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal tension that is conducive to direct reprogramming.",

                                "Direct reprogramming involves both disruption of the existing regulatory network (generally early on) and establishment of another. The initial nonspecific disruption is often mechanistically associated with cell cycle regulation, cell senescence, chromatin inactivation, and genome stability. To assess the impact of mechanobiological changes associated with spheroid culture on direct reprogramming, primary human neonatal dermal fibroblasts (hNDFs) were transduced with doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors for the BAMN factors. After dox induction in monolayer to ensure unbiased activation of the transgenes, hNDFs were either plated onto Matrigel-coated cover slips as 2D controls or centrifuged in microwells to form 3D aggregates, or \u201cspheroids\u201d. The expression of neuron-specific \u03b2-tubulin III (Tuj1) was used as a marker of neuronal fate. Tuj1 expression began earlier in spheroids than in 2D culture, appearing as early as day two (two days after dox induction and one day after spheroid formation) (FIG. 9B-C).",
                                "To evaluate relative reprogramming efficiency, spheroids were replated after three days onto Matrigel-coated cover slips. We did not use enzymatic disaggregation because we found that neurons had disproportionate difficulty in recovering from and re-adhering after spheroid dissociation, perhaps due to the increased sensitivity of interconnected extended processes in spheroids to mechanical trituration. This was in agreement with previously published findings on dissociating neural precursor spheroids, which suffered from sluggish growth attributed to possible removal of vital receptors by enzyme-mediated dissociation, and even in the absence of enzyme dissociators, over 50% cell death after spheroid dissociation. At two weeks post-dox induction, monolayer iNs still displayed very few Tuj1+ cells. Spheroid iNs, in contrast, had dramatically improved neural conversion (4.06%, FIG. 9D), by over 67-fold (p<0.05, FIG. 1F).",

We knew that onset would be more rapid (as early as Day 2; FIG. 111B) and ultimately greater than in 2D (FIG. 11D-F), but what was unexpected was to see a consistent and distinct spatial pattern of Tuj1 expression. Rather than a gradual and spatially homogenous increase, expression began on the periphery of the spheroid, arguably moving somewhat inward over time but remaining concentrated on the exterior. Inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling enhanced the reprogramming, especially in the center of the spheroids."

This method is valuable for the target genes in heterochromatin that have low accessibility. First, cells were introduced into high throughput microfluidics devices with well-defined size of microchannels, and subjected to transient nuclear deformation. Three hours after cells passed through the channel, the cells were harvested for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) to generate a genome-wide map of chromatin accessibility. Subsequently, gRNAs were designed to target the sites with an increase of chromatin accessibility at the promoter of the genes of interest. Finally, we transfected cells with gRNA and the construct expressing Cas9 or dCas9-activation complex by using Lipofectamine\u2122 Stem Transfection Reagent, followed by a 24-hour incubation period. Then the transfected cells were subjected to nuclear deformation by using the high throughput microfluidics device. The mechanically-treated cells were collected and cultured for days, and the effects of gene activation or silencing were examined. Data from illustrative CRISPR methods of the invention is shown in FIGS. 13 and 14."

                                "The extracellular matrix stiffness has been studied as a monotonic or binary regulator of cell functions, and the mechanisms underlying epigenetic changes and cell reprogramming induced by matrix stiffness are not fully understood. Here we reveal that matrix stiffness serves as a biphasic regulator in the conversion of skin fibroblasts into induced neuronal (iN) cells, with the highest efficiency at an intermediate stiffness of 20 kPa, rather than on a soft surface known to facilitate neural differentiation. Epigenetic analysis indicates that histone 3 acetylation (AcH3) and the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) in the nucleus also have biphasic responses to matrix stiffness, and HAT inhibition abolishes the effect of matrix stiffness on Ac-13 and iN conversion. These findings shed light on the mechanotransduction mechanism underlying epigenetic regulation by matrix stiffness, and have potential applications in cell engineering.",
                                "**Matrix Stiffness Serves as a Biphasic Regulator of iN Conversion**",
                                "To determine the role of matrix stiffness on iN reprogramming, adult mouse fibroblasts were transduced with doxycycline-inducible lentiviruses containing the three reprogramming factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l (BAM), and then seeded onto polyacrylamide (PAAm) gels of various stiffness (40 kPa, 20 kPa, and 1 kPa) coated with fibronectin. Glass coverslips coated with the same ECM protein were used as a rigid glass surface control (FIG. 15a). As shown in FIG. 15b-c, both the cell area and nuclear volume of fibroblasts decreased as the stiffness of the PAAm gel decreased. After fibroblasts were seeded on PAAm gels for 48 hours, we found that the number of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle decreased with matrix stiffness (FIG. 15d). These results suggest that matrix stiffness can significantly affect cell spreading and proliferation. To determine the effect of matrix stiffness on the direct conversion of fibroblasts into neurons, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were cultured on glass and PAAm gels of varying stiffness. After 7 days, cultures were fixed and immunostained for neuronal marker, neuron-specific class III \u03b2-tubulin (Tubb3) in order to identify iN cells and determine the reprogramming efficiency (FIG. 15a). Interestingly, we found that matrix stiffness had profound effects on the reprogramming efficiency, demonstrating a biphasic enhancement (FIG. 15e). Matrices of intermediate stiffness significantly enhanced the reprogramming efficiency, independent of ECM protein components (FIG. 15e). Interestingly, intermediate stiffness (\u02dc20 kPa) significantly enhanced the mRNA level of pioneer factor Ascl1 compared to glass, 40 kPa and 1 kPa gels (FIG. 15f). To determine whether matrix stiffness could modulate the activation of endogenous Ascl1, fibroblasts were transduced with an Ascl1 promoter driven-GFP construct and reprogrammed for 2 days. We found a significant increase in the number of Ascl1 promoter-GFP+ cells in the intermediate stiffness group compared to glass and other stiffness groups (FIG. 15g). Further characterization of the derived cells by immunostaining and electrophysiology (patch clamp) analysis revealed that mature iN cells were obtained on PAAm gels (FIG. 15h-i). Taken together, these results suggest that an intermediate matrix stiffness may enhance iN reprogramming by promoting endogenous Ascl1 expression.",
                                "**Intermediate Stiffness Increases Histone Acetylation and Chromatin Accessibility for iN Conversion**",
                                "Previous studies have reported that epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation, histone acetylation and DNA methylation, play an important role in cell reprogramming. To determine whether matrix stiffness may modulate iN reprogramming through global chromatin reorganization, we performed immunostaining of euchromatin marks AcH3, H3K27ac and 1H3K4me3, and heterochromatin marks H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4k20me3 in non-transduced fibroblasts cultured on gels of various stiffness. As shown in FIG. 16a-b, an intermediate stiffness of 20 kPa induced higher levels of AcH3 marks compared to stiffer and softer surfaces. On the other hand, no change was apparent in heterochromatin and other euchromatin marks examined. These results suggest that an intermediate stiffness may induce a more open chromatin stricture to facilitate cell reprogramming. Specifically, upon performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR at day 3, we found an increase in AcH3 at the promoter regions of Ascl1 and Tubb3, suggesting that an intermediate matrix stiffness can promote neuronal gene expression by modulating site-specific epigenetic changes (FIG. 16c-d). To directly determine whether matrix stiffness could alter chromatin accessibility, we performed the assay of transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), and found that cells on matrices with different stiffness (1 kPa, 20 kPa and glass) had distinguishable chromatin accessibility (FIG. 16e). Further analysis showed that an intermediate matrix stiffness significantly increased the accessibility of genomic regions of Ascl1-target genes in comparison to 1 kPa and stiff surfaces (FIG. 16f).",

                                "To further investigate how intermediate matrix stiffness promotes a more open chromatin state, we analyzed the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), in fibroblasts cultured on PAAm of varying stiffness for 2 days. Quantification of HAT activity revealed that gels of intermediate stiffness increased HAT activity compared to stiffer and soft surfaces (FIG. 16g). We then used chemical inhibitors to test the relative contributions of these epigenetic regulators to iN conversion. Inhibition of HAT activity by anacardic acid inhibited the biphasic enhancement of HAT activity and the reprogramming efficiency (FIG. 16h-i). These results suggest that HATs play a major role in matrix stiffness-mediated iN conversion."

Since extracellular matrix (ECM) has complex mechanical properties, including viscoelasticity, nonlinear elasticity, and plasticity, engineering synthetic matrices with tunable mechanical properties to investigate the mechanical regulation of cell reprogramming will provide crucial insights of cell fate determination during development and tissue regeneration. Therefore, we investigate how matrix viscoelasticity regulates cell reprogramming by employing hydrogels with independently tunable stiffness and viscoelasticity.",

Mechanical characterization was performed to confirm the elastic moduli and stress relaxation properties of hydrogels by using three interconnected methods including atomic force microscopy (AFM), rheology measurement, and compression tests. Adult mouse fibroblasts transduced with doxycycline (DOX)-inducible lentiviral vectors containing three reprogramming factors (i.e., Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l, BAM) were then seeded onto hydrogels. Neuron-specific class III \u03b2-tubulin (Tuj1) expression of cells after one week will be examined to compare the reprogramming efficiency of fibroblasts on hydrogels with different properties.

Rheology measurement and compression test results demonstrated that covalently crosslinked alginate hydrogels do not exhibit stress relaxation in response to deformation, while ionically crosslinked gels have time-dependent mechanical dynamics (FIG. 17b-c). To determine the effect of matrix stress relaxation on the direct conversion of fibroblasts into neurons, BAM-transduced fibroblasts were cultured on alginate hydrogels of tunable mechanical properties. After 7 days, cultures were fixed and immunostained for Tuj1 to identify iN cells and determine the reprogramming efficiency. We found that matrices with stress relaxation behaviors significantly enhanced the reprogramming efficiency compared to matrices without stress relaxation (FIG. 17d-e), especially at the low stiffness that facilitates neural maturation. Epigenetic analysis suggested that viscoelastic matrix promoted a more open chromatin structure for cell reprogramming. In addition, the analysis of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (FIG. 17f) suggested that the decrease of HDAC activity in the cells on viscoelastic matrix might account for the enhanced reprogramming efficiency.",
