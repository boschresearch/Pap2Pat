# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- motivate need for culturing human epidermal keratinocytes

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION

- introduce novel system for culturing human epidermal keratinocytes
- describe kit for culturing keratinocytes

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- define terms and conventions
- describe keratinocyte cells and their functions
- discuss laminin proteins and their structures
- introduce methods for culturing keratinocytes on laminin matrices
- describe cell culture substrates and media
- specify particular laminin isoforms and their combinations
- outline cell culture systems and their advantages

### EXAMPLES

- isolate primary keratinocytes
- culture primary keratinocytes
- perform quantitative PCR analysis
- perform FACS analysis
- generate RNA sequencing data
- analyze RNA sequencing data
- describe cell culture methods
- demonstrate laminin isoform expression
- evaluate keratinocyte growth on laminin substrates
- analyze keratinocyte gene expression and differentiation
- validate keratinocyte functionality in vitro and in vivo

## SUMMARY

- introduce xeno-free keratinocyte culture method
