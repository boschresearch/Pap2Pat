    "title": "Biologically relevant laminin as chemically defined and fully human platform for human epidermal keratinocyte culture",

    "abstract": "The current expansion of autologous human keratinocytes to resurface severe wound defects still relies on murine feeder layer and calf serum in the cell culture system. Through our characterization efforts of the human skin basement membrane and murine feeder layer 3T3-J2, we identified two biologically relevant recombinant laminins\u2014LN-511 and LN-421- as potential candidates to replace the murine feeder. Herein, we report a completely xeno-free and defined culture system utilizing these laminins which enables robust expansion of adult human skin keratinocytes. We demonstrate that our laminin system is comparable to the 3T3-J2 co-culture system in terms of basal markers\u2019 profile, colony-forming efficiency and the ability to form normal stratified epidermal structure in both in vitro and in vivo models. These results show that the proposed system may not only provide safer keratinocyte use in the clinics, but also facilitate the broader use of other cultured human epithelial cells in regenerative medicine.",

                "Recently, De Luca and co-workers1 demonstrated the possibility to regenerate whole functional epidermis on a 7-year-old child with junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a severe, often lethal, skin blistering disease caused by a mutation in epithelial basement membrane (BM) laminin LN-332 chains2\u20135, or in the genes for type XVII collagen, \u03b16, and \u03b24 integrin6. The patient\u2019s keratinocytes were corrected by gene therapy for a LAMB3 mutation, and then expanded in vitro on mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, essentially as described by Rheinwald and Green (R&G)7 to treat large burns8, and subsequently transplanted to replace the entire skin. Prior to that, Wu et al. showed that engineered epidermal progenitor cells have the potential to function as a gene therapy vehicle to correct diet-induced obesity and diabetes9. These two epidermal cell therapy approaches emphasize a huge clinical potential for treatments of lethal or debilitating epidermal diseases. However, the use of the human/mouse xenograft culture system may hinder extensive use of these therapies due to the undefined nature of the system. The 3T3 mouse feeders, bovine serum, and cholera toxin used in the R&G culture system are all classified as ancillary materials (AMs) Risk Tier 4 or high-risk materials according to the U.S. Pharmacopeia USP 29, Section <1043>. From a clinical application standpoint, these AMs when used to produce human cultured skin generate a potential risk of exposing the patient to zoonotic pathogens and immunogenic agents10. Furthermore, assessment and removal strategies of these high-risk AMs, in particular for cholera toxin, remain challenging in today\u2019s good manufacturing practice systems. Regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency currently classify cultured epithelial autografts produced using the R&G method as xenografts and these are approved only for treatment of severe burns (i.e. above 30% total body surface area) or for compassionate use1,11.",
                "Multiple unsuccessful attempts have been made to develop a human defined cell culture system for expansion of human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) in vitro. The attempts include the use of conditioned media from R&G\u2019s 3T3-J2 cells12, human feeder cells, or proteins13, as well as the use of various protein coatings, such as fibronectin, collagens, and serum-derived vitronectin14\u201319. Although many claims have been made in the literature on having successfully replaced R&G\u2019s 3T3 co-culture method, most of the feeder- and xeno-free reported methods still require initial HEKs expansion using a 3T3 feeder layer to obtain the starting HEK progenitor population15,20,21. Furthermore, undefined bovine pituitary extract is often used to maintain HEKs in proliferative state and prevent early senescence in feeder-free system22. Hence, the development of an effective, reproducible, defined, and fully human system for the culturing of human keratinocytes is still a major unmet clinical need.",
                "In skin, the keratinocytes are positioned on a specialized BM that contains type IV and XVIII collagens, perlecan, and agrin proteoglycans, as well as highly epithelium-specific \u03b13 chain laminin proteins, LN-332, LN-311, and LN-32123. In addition to \u03b13 chain laminins, the epithelial BM contains LN-511, a ubiquitous component present in the BMs of almost all tissues, where it forms an adhesion and growth surface for BM-associated cells23\u201326. Pouliot et al.27 reported that both LN-511 and LN-521 are present in neonatal and adult human skin. They demonstrated that these laminins are potent for \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 integrin-mediated adhesion of both neonatal and adult HEKs in vitro. However, it is noteworthy that the LN-511 and LN-521 preparation used in their experiment was derived and purified from a highly crosslinked human placenta extracellular matrix (ECM), containing partially proteolytic protein and also other laminins (e.g. LN-211 and LN-411)28.",
                "Based on the knowledge about subepithelial BM components, we hypothesized that HEK-associated laminin matrices present in vivo can support the growth of keratinocytes in vitro and replace feeder cells, essentially as we have shown for pluripotent human embryonic stem cells, which can be expanded from single-cell suspension on a pure LN-511 or LN-521 matrix without the use of feeder cells and Rho kinase inhibitors that inhibit apoptosis29\u201331."

                        "We first re-analyzed the ECM components of the human skin BM (laminins in particular) using immunochemistry and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in order to determine which laminin isoform(s) could have potential to support adhesion and propagation of HEKs in vitro. We confirmed that LN-332, LN-511, and LN-521 are the laminins expressed in the sub-epidermal BM (Fig.\u00a01a, b). In addition to these laminins, we also observed high expression level of the laminin \u03b24 chain from RNA-seq data (Fig.\u00a01b). However, currently available laminin \u03b24 chain antibodies did not yield specific staining in the keratinocytes or the epidermal BM (Fig.\u00a01a). Hence, we could not verify its location in human skin. Furthermore, no human recombinant laminin isoforms containing the laminin \u03b24 chain are currently available. In addition to the analysis of laminin expression in human skin, we also examined which laminin chains are mainly expressed in R&G\u2019s 3T3-J2 fibroblasts because these cells have been used to this day as feeder layer for HEK culture. We found that the 3T3-J2 fibroblasts mainly express LN-411 and LN-421, with a small proportion of LN-511 and LN-521 (Fig.\u00a01c).Fig. 1Identification of laminin chain expression in human epidermal basement membrane. a Immunofluorescent staining of laminin isoforms in skin section. Laminin isoform stainings at human skin basement membrane showed positive for laminin \u03b13, \u03b15, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b31, and \u03b32 chain isoforms.

Only expression of laminin \u03b14, \u03b15 \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b31, and \u03b32 chains were observed (n\u2009=\u20093, error bar represents means\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m.) d Morphology of human epidermal keratinocytes cultured on various laminin matrices vs. controls (without coating/co-cultured with 3T3-J2 fibroblasts). Cells cultured on plastic only (control), LN-111 (Matrigel laminin), and LN-332 did not survive. Images were taken at day 7 post seeding. Scale bar\u2009=\u2009100\u2009\u03bcm",
                        "Based on these analyses, we cultured HEKs on LN-511, LN-521, LN-411, LN-421, and LN-332 to compare the adhesion properties of HEKs. The R&G 3T3 co-culture system was used as a positive control, while non-coated plates and LN-111 served as negative controls. All HEK culture on laminins was carried out in an animal-free and defined Keratinocyte Growth Medium-Chemically Defined (KGM-CD) cell culture system without any initial expansion using R&G\u2019s 3T3 feeder layer. We observed that LN-511 and LN-521 (but not LN-332) supported freshly isolated adult HEK adhesion and spreading (Fig.\u00a01d). To our surprise, however, LN-411 and LN-421 (the main laminins expressed by murine 3T3-J2 fibroblasts although not present in human skin BM) were also able to support HEK adhesion. We have also tested the laminin coatings against other serum-free defined media such as EpiLife-S7 and CnT-07. However, the use of KGM-CD medium in conjunction with laminins was better than other cell culture media we have tested (unpublished data). There were no significant differences between LN-511 and LN-521, or between LN-411 and LN-421 in supporting HEK adhesion, but we found that LN-511 and LN-421 were able to better sustain HEKs in long-term culture compared to LN-521 and LN-411 (i.e. more terminally differentiated cells were observed in initial culture for LN-521 and LN-411 (Fig.\u00a01d), which resulted in lower population doublings (Supplementary Figure\u00a01). In addition, we also tested possible combinations of laminins (for example: LN-511\u2009+\u2009LN-421, LN-511\u2009+\u2009LN-332, LN-421\u2009+\u2009LN-332, and LN-511\u2009+\u2009LN-421\u2009+\u2009LN-332), as well as with other BM components such as fibronectin, collagen I, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. However, there was no additive effect on mixing these components on keratinocyte culture. Therefore, we concluded that LN-511 or LN-421 alone is able to effectively support keratinocyte adhesion and growth."

We found that LN-511 and LN-421 were able to support HEK proliferation and colony-forming capabilities comparable to the 3T3 co-culture system (Fig.\u00a02a, b). We also examined the genetic stability of HEKs cultured on LN-511 and LN-421 by karyotyping and found no noticeable translocations or other chromosomal changes (Supplementary Figure\u00a02a).Fig. 2In vitro characterization of HEKs cultured on laminin system. a Growth rate of keratinocytes cultured on LN-511 and LN-421, compared to the conventional R&G\u2019s method: co-cultured with 3T3 murine fibroblasts (labeled as 3T3).

                        "Subsequently, in order to determine if HEKs cultured using our laminin system were able to retain their basal properties comparable to the 3T3 co-culture control, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on both basal keratinocyte markers KRT5 and KRT14, as well as differentiation markers KRT1 and KRT10 over at least 10 passages. In comparison with the co-culture system, keratinocytes on both LN-511 and LN-421 displayed similar trend toward maturation as the passage number increased (Fig.\u00a02c). This demonstrates that our laminin system is robust enough to maintain HEKs in long-term culture, and is comparable to the 3T3 co-culture system.",
                        "We next performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to characterize the identity of HEKs cultured on LN-511 or LN-421. We found that at least 90% of the cells that were freshly cultured on either LN-511 or LN-421 retained their basal markers, suggesting that these cells were keratinocyte progenitors (Fig.\u00a02d, Supplementary Figure\u00a02b). This result was confirmed by immunostaining, showing the expression of basal markers as well as transcription factor p63 (Fig.\u00a02e). TP63 is known to regulate keratinocyte proliferation and is required for the development and maintenance of keratinocytes in human skin32.",
                        "Additionally, we also carried out organotypic culture to explore if HEKs cultured using our laminin system were able to form a normal stratified epidermal structure in vitro. HEKs cultured on both LN-511 and LN-421 system were able to stratify, forming normal epidermal skin layer with stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spongiosum, and stratum basale similar to that of a normal skin and those cultured using 3T3 co-culture system. Comparatively, LN-511 and LN-421 show good maturation of the keratinocytes toward the surface with intact formation of basal layer. We showed the presence of both basal and differentiation marker expression of HEKs cultured in laminin system similar to the 3T3 co-culture system by immunofluorescence staining (Fig.\u00a02f).

Basal and differentiation markers showed similar expression levels in the different three culture systems, confirming that the cells grown on the tested platforms were all progenitors (Fig.\u00a03a). Overall, keratinocytes grown on LN-421 and LN-511 showed similar transcriptomic profiles: Spearman\u2019s ranked correlation of 0.99,\u00a0with 60 differentially expressed (DE) genes (false discovery rate, FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), 32 of these genes with a fold change >1.5, and fold changes ranging from 3.4-fold more to 3.1-fold less (Fig.\u00a03b, Supplementary Figure\u00a03a, Supplementary Figure\u00a04, Supplementary Data\u00a01). However, we found large differences when comparing the transcriptome of the keratinocytes grown on the two laminins with the transcriptomic profile of cells grown using the 3T3 co-culture system: Spearman\u2019s ranked correlation of 0.94 and 0.95, with\u00a07694 and 7587 DE genes with FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 between keratinocytes grown on LN-511 and LN-421 when compared with the 3T3 co-culture, respectively. Among these 7694 and 7587 DE genes, 5290 and 4894 had a fold change >1.5 with fold changes ranging from 17.5-fold more to 74-fold less, and from 11-fold more to 82.7-fold less in the comparison of HEKs grown on LN-421 and LN-511 compared against the 3T3 co-culture, respectively (Fig.\u00a03c, Supplementary Figure\u00a03b, Supplementary Data\u00a01). In both keratinocytes grown on LN-421 or LN-511, we observed a significant downregulation (FDR\u2009<\u200910\u22126) of genes involved in the \u201cepithelial mesenchymal transition\u201d and several pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g. \u201cinterferon alpha response\u201d, \u201cinterferon gamma response\u201d, and \u201cTNFA signaling via NFKB\u201d). Pro-inflammatory pathways are known to be upregulated in human skin keratinocytes when co-cultured with fibroblasts33. We also observed downregulation of genes involved in several developmental pathways (e.g. \u201cTGF beta signaling\u201d for LN-421 FDR\u2009=\u20099\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126 and LN-511 FDR\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124, respectively, and \u201cWNT beta catenin signaling\u201d for LN-421 FDR\u2009=\u20094\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 and LN-511 FDR\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22122, respectively). These keratinocytes also displayed a strong upregulation (FDR\u2009<\u200910\u22126) of \u201cMYC targets\u201d and cell cycle (i.e. \u201cE2F targets\u201d and \u201cGM2 checkpoint\u201d) among other cellular processes. MYC has been shown to regulate keratinocyte adhesion and proliferation34,35. Taken together, our data suggest that the transcriptome of the keratinocytes grown on LN-511 and LN-421 are less inflammatory and display more proliferative features than cells grown using the 3T3 graft co-culture system.Fig. 3Transcriptomic profile of HEKs cultured on laminin system. a Heatmap with expression levels of laminin genes and basal and differentiation keratinocyte marker genes (averaged across biological replicates and represented as log10 of transcripts per million, TPM). b Correlation between the transcriptome of keratinocytes grown on a 3T3 co-culture, LN-421, and LN-511.

The graft application and side view of the graft applied using this technique are displayed in Fig.\u00a04a, b.

To demonstrate that the origin of the formed epidermis was of human origin, but not from the host, the section was immunostained with antihuman Ku80 nuclear staining antibody (Fig.\u00a04e). Next, immunofluorescence staining of basal and differentiation markers revealed that keratinocytes cultured on either LN-511 or LN-421 were stratified normally in vivo (Fig.\u00a04f).

                "In this study, we have developed a chemically defined and xeno-free method to culture HEKs without feeder layer. We have demonstrated via both in vitro and in vivo characterizations that our laminin system (LN-511 and LN-421) provide robust culture platform to replace the standard H&G\u2019s method without compromising the quality of the cells. Based on characterizations that we have performed in this study, we have showed that there were no observable differences between LN-511 and LN-421 in supporting HEK culture. However, we noted keratinocytes cultured on LN-511 or LN-421 displayed slightly different morphology in vitro. While keratinocytes cultured on LN-511 adhered as individual cells, keratinocytes grown on LN-421 formed colony-like morphology reminiscent of keratinocytes co-cultured using a 3T3 feeder layer (Fig.\u00a01d). We also analyzed the migration pattern of the keratinocytes cultured using these two laminins, and observed that keratinocytes on LN-421 moved in a circular/rotational motion similar to HEKs in 3T3 co-culture system (Supplementary Movie\u00a01 and 3), while LN-511 influenced individual keratinocytes to move independently in a directed motion manner (Supplementary Movie\u00a02). Such a rotational motion has been reported to define the \u201cstemness\u201d of keratinocytes37, even though our transcriptome data showed both laminin systems are nearly identical (Fig.\u00a03b).",
                "To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports regarding the function of LN-421 for culturing HEKs. Even though HEKs cultured on LN-511 and LN-421 were morphologically different, we did not observe any significant differences in their characteristics in vivo or in vitro. Our immunostaining, qPCR, and RNA-seq analyses did not reveal the presence of the laminin \u03b14 chain in the sub-epidermal BM, but was expressed by 3T3 cells (Fig.\u00a01a, c).",
                "It is well appreciated that direct contacts with fibroblasts is important for HEKs and adult epithelial cells, in general, to grow rapidly in culture20. It has been demonstrated that the use of conditioned medium could not recapitulate the effect that was given by co-culture system with the fibroblasts12,20. We hypothesize that a key factor why such direct contact was needed was the matrix used in the culture coating: the laminin \u03b14 chain expressed by fibroblasts. However, extensive investigations are required in order to validate our speculation, as at this point we are yet to understand the role of this matrix protein on keratinocyte survival and proliferation in culture. No evidence on the role of laminin \u03b14 chain in skin has been shown in the literature, although it was recently reported that the processing of laminin alpha chains (including \u03b14 chain) generates peptides involved in skin wound healing, which possess broad antimicrobial activity for host defense38. Therefore, it will be interesting to further dissect laminin \u03b14 chain function in skin in the future.",
                "Taken together, we have demonstrated the ability to culture functional HEKs in a fully human and chemically defined cell culture system without the need of 3T3 feeder cells using skin-associated laminin matrices. We are convinced that our completely animal-free and chemically defined culture system will not only provide a safer delivery system for patients, but that it also opens up a greater applicability in epithelial stem cell therapy."
