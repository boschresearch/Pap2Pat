    "abstract": "The present disclosure relates to methods for culturing human epidermal keratinocytes. When keratinocytes are cultured on plates coated with a laminin containing an alpha-4 chain or an alpha-5 chain, in a xeno-free, chemically defined cell culture medium, they expand efficiently in vitro. Useful cell culture kits for culturing keratinocytes are also described herein, as are methods of using such cells for treatment of burns or chronic wounds.",

                        "The present disclosure relates to methods for culturing human epidermal keratinocytes. These keratinocytes can then be used in therapies such as for treating severe burns minor burns, and chronic wounds. Other potential therapeutic applications of these cultured cells can be for the treatment of any epithelial injuries or conditions in the human body (such as in the eye, bladder, oral cavity, intestine, etc.), including cases in which only the epithelium is compromised, or in which sub-epithelial components are also damaged. Also disclosed are kits for practicing the methods. Very generally, the keratinocytes are cultured on a substrate of Laminin-411, Laminin-421, Laminin-511, and/or Laminin-521, and exposed to serum-free medium to support keratinocytes survival in vitro without the aid of feeder cells.",
                        "Burn injuries remain a huge clinical problem as autologous donor sites become insufficient to provide primary cover for wound closure when the total body surface area (TBSA) exceeds 40%. One technology developed to overcome this problem is the use of cultured epithelial autografts (CEA). This method involves the isolation and serial expansion of skin epidermal keratinocytes from a small skin biopsy to obtain large amount of cultured epithelium for definitive wound coverage within a 3 to 4 week period. Since the report of permanent coverage of large burn wounds with autologous cultured human epithelium, this technology has been used successfully worldwide to treat severe burns, in what is frequently a life-saving procedure.",
                        "This current gold standard protocol for culturing human epidermal keratinocytes for severe burn treatment requires the use of some animal-derived products (e.g., bovine serum and murine 3T3 fibroblasts as feeder cells). Such products do not meet clinical quality criteria which are common in today's cell therapy environment. The presence of murine cells carries the risk of exposing human cell culture to animal pathogens and immunogenic agents. Moreover, fetal bovine serum (FBS) used in the culture media is undefined and has batch-to-batch variation.",
                        "To overcome this problem, serum-free and xeno-free cell culture media have been developed for keratinocyte cultures. However, these systems remain non-optimal and none are used in clinical applications for severe wound defects. It has been demonstrated that culturing keratinocytes using serum-free keratinocyte growth media without the use of irradiated 3T3 feeder cells could not preserve the proliferative capacity of keratinocytes compared to those supported by feeder cells.",
                        "It would be desirable to develop methods for supporting keratinocyte survival and expansion in vitro without the aid of 3T3 feeder cells and animal-derived serum."

                        "A keratinocyte is an epidermal cell that produces keratin. Keratinocytes are the predominant cells in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, constituting 90% of the cells found there. Those keratinocytes found in the basal layer (stratum basale) of the skin are sometimes referred to as \u201cbasal cells\u201d or \u201cbasal keratinocytes.\u201d The primary function of keratinocytes is the formation of a barrier against environmental damage, such as by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses, heat, UV radiation and water loss. Once pathogens start to invade the upper layers of the epidermis, keratinocytes can react by producing proinflammatory mediators, particularly chemokines.",
                        "One major reason for the loss of cellular phenotypes of primary cells cultured in vitro (such as keratinocytes) is a lack of normal cell-matrix interactions. In vivo, most organized cells such as human epidermal keratinocytes are tightly anchored to a special matrix known as the basement membrane (BM) or basal lamina. The BMs contain several specific components such as collagen IV, proteoglycans, and laminin proteins. The laminins are unique BM components, which exist in a large number of isoforms 16). Some isoforms are quite ubiquitous, while others are highly cell type specific. The laminin isoforms LN-511 and LN-521 are significant components of most embryonic and adult basement membranes and have important roles in development. These two isoforms, both of which are located in the BMs underlying the skin, have been shown to promote keratinocytes, stem cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and possibly contribute to the maintenance of an undifferentiated phenotype in the stem cell population of the skin.",
                        "Laminins are a family of heterotrimeric glycoproteins that reside primarily in the basal lamina. They function via binding interactions with neighboring cell receptors on the one side and by binding to other laminin molecules or other matrix proteins such as collagens, nidogens or proteoglycans. The laminin molecules are also important signaling molecules that can strongly influence cellular behavior and function. Laminins are important in both maintaining cell/tissue phenotype, as well as in promoting cell growth and differentiation in tissue repair and development.",
                        "Laminins are large, multi-domain proteins, with a common structural organization. The laminin molecule integrates various matrix and cell interactive functions into one molecule.",
                        "A laminin protein molecule comprises one \u03b1-chain subunit, one \u03b2-chain subunit, and one \u03b3-chain subunit, all joined together in a trimer through a coiled-coil domain. The twelve known laminin subunit chains can form at least 15 trimeric laminin types in native tissues. Within the trimeric laminin structures are identifiable domains that possess binding activity towards other laminin and basal lamina molecules, and membrane-bound receptors. For example, domains VI, IVb, and IVa form globular structures, and domains V, IIIb, and IIIa (which contain cysteine-rich EGF-like elements) form rod-like structures. Domains I and II of the three chains participate in the formation of a triple-stranded coiled-coil structure (the long arm).",
                        "There exist five different alpha chains, three beta chains and three gamma chains that in human tissues have been found in at least fifteen different combinations. These molecules are termed Laminin-1 to Laminin-15 based on their historical discovery, but an alternative nomenclature describes the isoforms based on their chain composition, e.g. Laminin-111 (previously termed Laminin-1) that contains alpha-1, beta-1 and gamma-1 chains. Four structurally defined family groups of laminins have been identified. The first group of five identified laminin molecules all share the \u03b21 and \u03b31 chains, and vary by their \u03b1-chain composition (\u03b11 to \u03b15 chain). The second group of five identified laminin molecules, including Laminin-521, all share the \u03b22 and \u03b31 chain, and again vary by their \u03b1-chain composition. The third group of identified laminin molecules has one identified member, Laminin-332, with a chain composition of \u03b13\u03b23\u03b32. The fourth group of identified laminin molecules has one identified member, Laminin-213, with the newly identified \u03b33 chain (\u03b12\u03b21\u03b33).",

                                "FIG. 5 is a graph showing the results for each marker on each substrate. The FACS analysis showed that keratinocytes cultured on either LN-511 or LN-421 expressed high level of basal markers (above 90% positive) and low expression of differentiation markers, comparable to control (3T3). This result was separately confirmed by immunostaining for these basal markers as well as transcription factor p63, which is known to regulate keratinocyte proliferation and is required for the development and maintenance of keratinocytes in human skin.",

                                "As seen in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, basal and differentiation markers showed similar expression levels in the different three culture systems, confirming that the cells grown on the tested platforms were all progenitors. Overall, keratinocytes grown on LN-421 and LN-511 showed similar transcriptomic profiles (Spearman's ranked correlation of 0.99 and only 60 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05).",
                                "More differences were found when comparing the transcriptome of the keratinocytes grown on the two laminins with the transcriptomic profile of cells grown using the 3T3 co-culture system (Spearman's ranked correlation of 0.94 and 0.95, 7,694 and 7,587 differentially expressed genes between keratinocytes grown on LN-511 and LN-421 when compared with the 3T3 co-culture respectively). This is seen in FIG. 6C. In keratinocytes grown on LN-421 or LN-511, significant downregulation (FDR<10\u22126) was observed for genes involved in the \u201cepithelial mesenchymal transition\u201d and several pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g. \u201cinterferon alpha response\u201d, \u201cinterferon gamma response\u201d and \u201cTNFA signaling via NFKB\u201d). Pro-inflammatory pathways are known to be upregulated in human skin keratinocytes when co-cultured with fibroblasts. Downregulation was also observed in genes involved in several developmental pathways (e.g. \u201cTGF beta signaling\u201d for LN-421 FDR=9\u00d710\u22126 and LN-511 FDR=1\u00d710\u22124, respectively, and \u201cWNT beta catenin signaling\u201d for LN-421 FDR=4\u00d710\u22124 and LN-511 FDR=1\u00d710\u22122, respectively). These keratinocytes also displayed a strong upregulation (FDR<10\u22126) of \u201cMYC targets\u201d and cell cycle (i.e. \u201cE2F targets\u201d and \u201cGM2 checkpoint\u201d) among other cellular processes. MYC has been shown to regulate keratinocyte adhesion and proliferation. Taken together, this data suggests that the transcriptome of the keratinocytes grown on LN-511 and LN-421 seemed to be less inflammatory and displayed more proliferative features than cells grown using the 3T3 co-culture system.",

This de-epidermalised dermis (DED) was then cut into 2 cm\u00d72 cm squares and the reticular side of the dermis was seeded with 5\u00d7105 human dermal fibroblasts with the help of a 1-cm diameter stainless steel ring. The next day, each DED was flipped and secondary keratinocytes culture that had been previously grown on either LN-421, LN-511, or co-cultured with 3T3 were seeded, 2\u00d7105 cells on each DED in cFAD culture medium. The cFAD culture medium was a mixture of DMEM and Ham's F12 at a ratio of 3:1, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 pg/mL insulin, 0.18 mM adenine, 0.4 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone, 0.1 nM cholera toxin, 2 nM triiodothyronine, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, and 50 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Cultures were grown immersed in this medium for 7 days, then they were lifted to air-liquid interface for 14 days to stratify. Each sample was then processed for cryosection. Frozen sections were cut at 5 \u03bcm thickness and stained with H&E staining.",

Investigative Dermatology, 91, 315-318 (1988). This method is suitable for assessing graft survival and for distinguishing between human epidermis generated by the graft from the epidermis of the recipient animal, as it minimizes graft contraction compared to conventional grafting. Fourteen days post-transplantation, human epidermis generated by keratinocytes cultured on either LN-511, LN-421, or using 3T3 co-cultures were harvested, sectioned and characterized by both Hematoxylin/Eosin (H&E) staining and immunostaining.",

To demonstrate that the formed epidermis was of human origin, and not from the host, the section was immunostained with anti-human Ku80 nuclear staining antibody. Next, immunofluorescence staining of basal and differentiation markers revealed that keratinocytes cultured on either LN-511 or LN-421 were stratified normally in vivo. Continuous laminin \u03b32 chain expression was observed underneath the basal layer of the generated human epidermis on both LN-511 and LN-421, suggesting that these transplanted HEKs secreted BM proteins (likely epithelial laminin, LN-332) and formed a functional epidermal layer."

Current methods for culturing and propagating human epidermal keratinocytes in serum-free medium require initial expansion in a feeder system for cell survival before they are collected and characterized. However, these methods cannot sustain keratinocyte growth in long-term culture (i.e., cells below fifth passage are typically used in characterization). The method described in the present disclosure enables more consistent and robust expansion of keratinocytes in a xeno-free and fully defined system without going through initial expansion by using a 3T3-feeder system.",

                        "With reference to FIG. 5, keratinocyte cells grown on LN-421 and LN-511 had high levels of basal markers and low expression of differentiation markers compared to the control, thereby implying that culturing keratinocytes on LN-421 or LN-511 in a chemically defined, xeno-free basal medium may be an alternative to growing keratinocytes in cultures containing animal cells while preserving their proliferative capacity. Therefore, this particular system reduces the risk of exposing any human cell culture to animal pathogens, allowing the cultured cell products to be used safely in the management of less severe burns and chronic wounds, since the system is xeno-free and fully defined.",
                        "Further, the epidermal keratinocytes grown using the disclosed methods above can be sustained for at least 10 passages, with differentiation markers starting to emerge after the seventh (7) passage, thereby improving over the typical five (5) passages current methods can support.",
                        "These methods allow for cultured therapeutic cell products, which are currently limited only to critical burn cases and severe vision loss due to safety concerns, to be used safely in the management of minor burns and chronic wounds. These cell products can also potentially be used for the treatment of any injuries or conditions in the human body (such as in the eye, bladder, oral cavity, intestine, etc.) with at least one epithelium defect. Further, there exists the possibility for wound coverage with cultured grafts without causing morbidity to the donor site, thereby improving quality of life for such patients.",
