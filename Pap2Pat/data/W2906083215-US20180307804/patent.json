                        "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are unintended and harmful reactions caused by normal uses of drugs. ADRs represent a significant public health problem all over the world. In the United States, it is estimated that over 2 million serious ADRs occur among hospitalized patients, resulting in over 100,000 deaths each year. Moreover, ADRs are a contributing factor to the high expenditure and low effectiveness of laboratory-based pharmaceutical drug development. Readily available information in the early stages of drug development can often be limited to the chemical structure of a drug candidate. However, predicting and preventing ADRs in the early stage of the drug development pipeline can help to enhance drug safety and reduce financial costs associated with drug discovery.",
                        "Finding novel associations between chemical substructures and ADRs could guide research efforts toward drug candidates that are more likely to lead to safe and efficacious drugs. For instance, if a chemical substructure is determined to be associated with ADRs, researchers could design drug candidates that do not incorporate such substructures. Elucidating such detailed relationships among chemical substructures and ADRs could infer new knowledge for domain experts, for instance, that could be utilized to redesign a drug under development and, thus, increase investigative efforts leading to viable candidates."

For each of the top predictive fingerprints, each layer can be investigated to identify atoms and associated drug molecules having the highest activation for the fingerprint during a first convolution step.
