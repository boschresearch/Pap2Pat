                        "Exceptional developments in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) have transformed HIV/AIDS from a deadly pandemic to a chronic and manageable disease (Antiviral Therapy Cohort, 2017). If administered efficiently, cART significantly reduces morbidity and mortality of HIV infected individuals, both in resourece-rich and in low- and middle-income countries (Quinn, 2008; Sabin, 2013; May et al. 2014, Harries et al. 2016; and Teeraanachai et al., 2017). However, emerging drug resistance mutations (DRMs) continue to threaten the desired outcome of cART.",
                        "HIV-capsid (CA) has emerged as a significant potential antiviral target over the past 15 years due to increased understanding of its involvement in the viral life cycle. The CA protein has two distinct domains, an N-terminal domain (CA-NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CA-CTD), which are connected by a flexible linker of \u02dc5 amino acid residues (FIG. 1A). Both the CA-NTD and the CA-CTD domains contain mostly \u03b1-helical secondary structure. The CA-NTD is composed of seven \u03b1-helices (\u03b11-\u03b17), whereas CA-CTD consists of four \u03b1-helices (\u03b18-\u03b111) and a short 310-helix. The structures of CA have revealed interactions between CA promoters in the form of hexameric and pentameric building blocks (Pornillos et al., 2009; and Pornillos et al., 2011). These structures also revealed that the fullerene-like structure of the capsid core is composed of 1,500 copies of CA organized into a lattice of \u02dc250 hexamers and 12 pentamers that facilitate closure of the capsid core.",
                        "The capsid core is involved in multiple steps of HIV replication. Following infection and fusion of viral and cellular membranes, the capsid core enters the cytosol where it undergoes controlled disassembly, process known as uncoating, as it moves through the cytosol to dock at the nuclear pore. The timing, process, and extent of uncoating the capsid core in the cytosol is not entirely known, but it has been suggested that uncoating is associated with the initiation of reverse transcription (Campbell and Hope, 2015). Once the capsid core reaches the nuclear pore, CA facilitates nuclear entry and enters the nucleus along with the preintegration complex. CA may also be involved in the integration of viral DNA into the host chromosome, but the specific role of CA in this process has not been well defined (Schaller et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2016; and Francis and Melikyan, 2018). During vial assembly (late stage of viral replication), the Gag polyprotein, which is the precursor of the capsid protein, assembles at the plasma membrane and buds as a spherical, immature non-infectious virus. Upon activation of the viral protease during maturation, Gag is processed into several structural proteins and small peptides, including the multifunctional CA (FIG. 1A), forming a conical capsid core (also referred to as capsid or core). Thus, CA plays an important role in HIV biology.",
                        "Many reports have shown that the stability of the capsid core and its interaction with host factors influences reverse transcription. Mutations that alter lattice stability or interactions between CA building blocks alter replication events and can severely impact viral infectivity. For example, stabilizing mutations E45A and E128A/R132A or destabilizing mutations R18A/N21A, P38A, Q63A, L136D, K170A, and Q129A that lead to either slow or rapid uncoating, respectively, ultimately decrease viral infectivity (Forshey et al, 2002). While destabilization must occur for successful replication, balance between stabilization and dissociation must be maintained, demonstrating an intricate link between capsid and viral infectivity. Similarly, disruption of CA interactions with a variety of host factors, including CPSF6 (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 6, TNPO3 (transportin 3), NUP153 (nucleoporin 153), NUP 358 (nucleoporin 358), and Cyclophilin A, has been shown to impact infectivity during replication (Krishnan et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2010; Schaller et al., 2011; Ambrose et al., 2012; Bichel et al., 2013; and Matreyek et al., 2013).",
                        "Given the role of CA in multiple steps of viral replication, it is an attractive antiviral target, offering novel strategies for therapeutic intervention (Prevelige, 2011; Bocanegra et al. 2012; and Li et al., 2013). Several drug-like compounds that bind at the CA-NTD or CA-CTD have been identified (Tang et al., 2003; Sticth et al., 2005; Ternois et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2007; Blair et al., 2010; Curreli et al., 2011; and Bocanegra et al., 2012). Among these are benzodiazepine (BD) and benzimidazole (BM) compounds (Fader et al., 2011; Lemke et al., 2012; Tremblay et al., 2012), pyrrolopyrazolones (BI-1 and BI-2) (Lamorte et al., 2013), and CAP-1 (Kelly et al., 2007 and Curreli et al., 2011). One of the most well-studied CA inhibitors is PF-3450074 (PF74) (FIG. 1A). The crystal structures of PF74 bound to CA (Blair et al., 2010; Bhattacharya et al., 2014; and Price et al., 2014) have shown that PF74 occupies a pocket located between the CA-NTD and CA-CTD. This binding pocket is also shared by small molecule BI-2, as well as the host factors CPSF6 and NUP153 (Price et al., 2014). Therefore, both PF74 and BI-2 are expected to prevent the interaction between CA and CPSF6 or NUP153 (Price et al., 2012 and Price et al., 2014). PF74 appears to modulate inter-subunit interactions, perturb capsid assembly, and increase the rate of CA multimerization in vitro. PF74 interferes with both early and late events of the HIV replication cycle (Blair et al., 2010 and Thenin-Houssier and Valente, 2016). The accumulation of late reverse transcription products, 2LTRs, and integrated provirus suggests antiviral activity of PF74 at early steps in viral replication (Blair et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2011; and Fricke et al., 2014), whereas disruption of the formation of native-like particles indicates additional roles of PF74 at later stages of HIV replication (Blair et al., 2010; Thenin-Houssier and Valente, 2016). In addition to above-mentioned chemical inhibitors, peptide inhibitors (such as NYAD-1) have also been reported. NYAD-1 disrupts the formation of both immature- and mature-like virus particles in cell-based assembly assays (Zhang et al., 2013). Despite promising leads, none of these compounds or their derivatives have advanced to clinical trials.",
                        "Recently reported CA inhibitors GS-CA1 and GS6207 (an analog of GS-CA1, also called GS-CA2) (FIG. 1B) have greater potency than currently approved anti-HIV drugs (Blair et al., 2010; Tse et al., 2017; and Zheng et al., 2018). GS-CA1 inhibits HIV-1 replication in T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at very low concentrations (EC50=240 pM and 140 pM, respectively). GS-6270 displays anti-HIV activity in MT-4 cells with an EC50 of 100 pM, whereas in PBMCs, it displays a mean EC50 of 50 pM (20-160 pM) against 23 HIV-1 clinical isolates from different subtypes (Zheng et al., 2018). In comparison, the most studied capsid inhibitor, PF74, displays a subtype-dependent range of EC50 between 80 nM and 640 nM in PBMCs. In MT-2 cells, the EC50 of PF74 is 570 nM (Blair et al., 2010). In addition, studies in rats and dogs indicate that a single subcutaneous injection maintains GS-CA1 and GS-6207 plasma concentrations above the plasma-binding-adjusted effective concentration required for 95% HIV-1 replication inhibition for >12 weeks, indicating their potential as a long-acting drug (Jarvis, 2017; Tse et al, 2017; Carnes et al., 2018; and Sager et al., 2019). Similar to PF74, GS-CA1 inhibits both early and late stages of virus replication.",

Reportedly, GS-CA1 binds CA at the same general site as PF74, CPSF6, and NUP153 (Tse et al., 2017). The crystal structure of CA in complex with GS-6207 is yet to be reported. Although no well-understood, GS-CA1 and GS-6207 possibly interact more extensively with CA than PF74, providing greater binding affinity and thereby, greater efficacy than PF74. Here, using computational approaches and reported inhibitor-bound CA structures, we present the details of interactions between GS-CA compounds and CA. We find the GS-CA compounds contain similar features that are also present in PF74, BI-2, NUP153, and CPSF6. Using the same structural features in our computational modeling, we designed a cyclic peptide (Pep-2-cyclic), that docked at the GS-CA biding site with comparable docking score. We validated the binding of Pep-2-cyclic to CA by determining CA binding affinity of Pep-2-cyclic using MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) experiments, which revealed that CA binds Pep-2-cyclic with \u02dc7-fold better affinity than PF74, a well-known CA inhibitor.",

A docked pose of GS-CA1 (with best Glide score) in the crystal structure of the native form of CA-hexamer (PDB entry 4XFZ) (Gres et al., 2015) is shown in FIG. 2. This figure shows that GS-CA1 binds in the close proximity to residues L56, M66, Q67, N74 and A105 (FIG. 2B and FIG. 2C). In vitro selection studies have identified GS-CA1 resistance mutations L56I, M661, Q67H, N74D and A105E (Perrier et al., 2017), suggesting that these mutations may affect GS-CA1 binding to the CA hexamer. Notably, IFD docking was conducted without any bias towards L56, M66, Q67, L74 or A105. In addition, in our model of the CA/GS-CA1 complex, CA-NTD residues 137, P38, S41, N53, T54, N57, Q63, L69, K70, 173, T106, T107, Y130, Y169, L172, R173 and Q179 also directly interact with GS-CA1 (FIG. 2D).

To assess whether the GS-CA1 binding pocket is conserved among subtypes, a consensus sequence was generated of CA from HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C), which accounts for more than 50% of all HIV-1 infections, using the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (world wide web at https://www.hiv.lanl.gov). The results showed that the GS-CA1 binding site in HIV-1C was highly conserved. Only one substitution in HIV-1C (F169) compared to HIV-1B (Y169) was noted. The nearest (C\u03b4) atom of Y169 (or F169 in HIV-1C) is within interacting distance of GS-CA1 (<3.8 \u212b), suggesting a weak interaction with GS-CA1.",
                                "GS-6207 differs from GS-CA1 by three modifications: (i) a cyclopropane moiety on sulfonamide group was replaced by a methyl group, (ii) difluoroethyl groups on indazole ring was replaced by a trifluoroethyl group, and (iii) difluoromethyl group on cyclopenta-pyrazole ring was replaced by a trifluoromethyl moiety. At present, the specific rationale for these replacements is not known. GS-6207 was dockedin the crystal structure of native form of CA (Gres et al., 2015). The results showed that GS-6207 binds in the same binding pocket as GS-CA1 and with a slightly better Glide score (\u221214.362 for GS-6207 versus \u221211.271 for GS-CA1), suggesting a better binding affinity. It was also noted that the orientation of cyclopenta-pyrazole ring in docked GS-6207 was switched by \u02dc180\u00b0 compared to that in GS-CA1, leading to the exposure of trifluoromethyl moiety to the solvent (FIG. 3A). Another remarkable difference between docked complexes of CA/GS-CA1 and CA/GS-6207 is the conformation of K70 and R173 side chains. In CA/GS-6207 complex, K70 side chain moves around 5 \u212b from the position in CA/GS-CA1 complex (FIG. 3B, solid arrow) towards the binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with C\u2550O of amide group in GS-6207 (FIG. 3B, dotted line). An additional H-bond may be one of the reasons that GS-6207 has better Glide score than GS-CA1. While the side chain conformation of R173 is also altered (FIG. 3B), it does not appear to be significant.",

Residues Q67, K70, T107 and L111 reside on helices 4 and 5, whereas H87 is part of the CypA binding loop (residues 85-93) (Gamble et al., 1996; and Ambrose and Aiken, 2014). The only common resistance mutation between GS-CA1 and PF74 is Q67H (Perrier et al., 2017), although other GS-CA1 resistance residues (L56, M66, L74, and A105) are also within interacting distance of PF74. A superposition of the CA/PF74 crystal structure (Gres et al., 2015) and the CA/GS-CA1 model is shown in FIG. 3C. It is clear from the figure that all three rings of PF74 (two phenyl rings and one indole ring) superpose extremely well on three different rings GS-CA1 (dotted circles 1, 2 and 3 in FIG. 3D). The PF74 indole ring superposes on the cyclopenta-pyrazole ring of GS-CA1 (circle 1). One of the two phenyl rings of PF74 superposes on the difluorobenzene ring of GS-CA1 (circle 2), whereas the other PF74 phenyl ring is at a topologically similar position to the indazole ring of GS-CA1 (circle 3). Additionally, the polar moieties of PF74 match topologically with the polar moieties of GS-CA1. Thus, the acetamide moiety of GS-CA1 superposes well on the corresponding moiety of PF74. These data suggest that certain structural features and interactions are common between GS-CA1 and PF74.",
                                "During IFD of GS-CA1 into the CA-hexamer, the conformations of most of the side chains in the GS-CA1/PF74 binding pocket did not change significantly as compared to the CA/PF74 crystal structure, with the exception of the side chain of K70 (FIG. 3C). The position of the K70 atom was shifted by \u02dc4.7 \u212b from its position in the CA/PF74 complex (FIG. 3C), suggesting an absence of interactions between K70 and GS-CA1, in contrast to K70 interactions with PF74. The absence of this interaction is a possible reason that mutation at K70 did not emerge during GS-CA1 in vitro resistance selection studies (Perrier et al., 2017). As mentioned above, the interaction of K70 is restored in the CA/GS-6207 complex. At present, the resistance mutation profile of GS-6207 is not known.",

BI-2 was shown to stabilize CA hexamers and inhibit HIV-1 at early stages of infection (Lamorte et al., 2013). Selection of viruses resistant to BI-2 identified mutations at residues A105 and T107 of CA-NTD (Lamorte et al., 2013). The high-resolution structure of CA in complex with BI-2 showed that it binds at the PF74 binding site. The superposition of the three compounds (GS-CA1, PF74, and BI-2) obtained from the superposition of Ca-atoms of CA-NTD showed that the three compounds have a common binding mode with CA-hexamer (FIG. 3E). Docking results of GS-CA1 showed that CA residue A105 is within interacting distance of GS-CA1, and the common resistance mutation A105T between GS-CA1 and BI-2 further confirms that the two compounds share part of the binding site.",

In addition, there exists a hydrophobic interaction between the methylsulfonyl moiety of GS-CA1 and P38 of CA (atoms of P38 are not shown).

                                "CAP-11-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-3-(2-(((5-((dimethylamino)methyl)furan-2-yl)methyl)thio)ethyl)urea is an assembly inhibitor for which the resistance mutation profile has not been reported (Kelly et al., 2007). The structure of CAP-1 bound CA-NTD have been solved by NMR and X-ray crystallography (Kelly et al., 2007). A comparison of the crystal and NMR structures demonstrated that CA undergoes significant conformational change upon CAP-1 binding. The superposition of the crystal structure of the CA/CAP-1 complex on the model structure of the CA/GS-CA1 complex showed that the two inhibitors did not bind at a common site (FIG. 5). However, two residues (M66 and L69) interacted with both GS-CA1 and CAP-1. The positions of M66 in the CA/GS-CA1 and CA/CAP-1 complexes are shown in FIG. 5. The compounds of the benzodiazepine (BD1-BD4) and benzimidazole (BM1-BM5) series bind to CA at a site that is close to the CAP-1 binding site (Lemke et al., 2012). While compounds from both series have been shown to bind at the same pocket, they have distinct resistance mutation profiles. Mutations V36T and G61E were selected with BD inhibitors, whereas K30R and S33G were selected with BM inhibitors. Both V36 and G61 are part of BM3 binding pocket (PDB entry 4E91) (Sticht et al., 2005). K30 is not within interacting distance of BM4, and the backbone carbonyl group of S33 forms only forms a Van der Waals interaction with BM4 (PDB entry 4E92) (Lemke et al., 2012). Hence, the resistance mechanism of BM4 does not seems to operate through direct interactions. The crystal structures of BD-3 and BM4 bound to CA-NTD showed that both compounds are within interacting distance of M66, similar to CAP-1. Hence, BD and BM series compounds do not share a binding site with GS-CA1, but they all have a common interaction with M66.",

A crystal structure of CA/C-A1 has not been solved. However, docking studies predict the binding of C-A1 in a pocket formed by two adjacent capsid monomers (Chen et al., 2016). This predicted binding site may be relevant, as mutations N74D and A105S conferred resistance to C-A1, and both residues (N74 and A105) are at the interface of two capsid monomers.",

Of 32 predicted docking poses of C-A1 in the same PDB file (4XZF) as used by Chen et al., 2016, none of the poses were within interacting distance of N74 or A105. Docking data predict that that resistance of N74D and A105S to C-A1 may not be due to binding defects imparted by mutations at these residues.",

                                "Several additional CA inhibitors have been reported, such as CK026, I-XW-035 compound 34 (Kortagere et al., 2012), C1 (Lemke et al., 2013), and Ebselen (Lemke et al., 2013). CK026 is a large molecule, and was not shown to inhibit HIV-1 in PBMCs. However, I-XW-053 and compound 34, derivatives of CK026, demonstrated inhibitory activities in PBMCs (Kortagere et al., 2014). A crystal structure of CA in complex with these compounds has not been solved. However, the docking results in combination with binding affinity determination via surface plasmon resonance revealed that compound 34 binds in the vicinity of P38, S41, R173, K170, and Q179 (Kortagere et al., 2014). All of these residues are within interacting distance of GS-CA1 in the modeled CA/GS-CA1 complex (FIG. 2).",
                                "Compound C1 has been shown to bind at a unique site near the CypA-binding loop and affects late steps by disrupting proper assembly of mature capsid (Lemke et al., 2013). However, the crystal structures of CA in the presence of compound C1 and BD series compounds shows that C1 induces CA dimer formation and binds at the interface of the dimer. Mutation R132T confers resistance to C1. In the crystal structures of C1 and BD/BM compounds, R132 forms a polar interaction with compound C1. These structures also show that C1 makes contact with the N-terminus of helix 2, forming hydrophobic interactions with P34, G35, 137 and P38. The benzoic acid moiety forms a direct hydrogen bond to A139, and there is a water-mediated hydrogen bond to S41 (Lemke et al., 2013). Both 137 and P38 form hydrophobic interactions with GS-CA1 (FIG. 2).",

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments revealed that ebselen covalently binds CA-CTD, most likely through a selenylsulfide linkage involving C198 and C218 (Thenin-Houssier et al, 21016). Both of these residues are part of the CA-CTD, and they are not within interacting distance of the GS-CA1 in our modeled CA/GS-CA1 complex. Therefore, it is predicted that ebselen and GS-CA1 binding sites do not overlap.",

Intermediate linear scaffolds were prepared by solid phase synthesis using a Fmoc/tbu strategy and starting with the very acid labile 2-C1Trt resin. After linear sequence assembly the fully protected peptide was removed from the resin by treatment with a mixture of 1% of TFA and 5% of TIS. Subsequently the peptide was cyclized by coupling the C-terminal carboxylic acid and the N-terminal amino group. This reaction was accomplished using PyBOP (2.5 excess) in presence of DIPEA (6\u00d7 excess) in DMF solution for 6 hours at room temperature. After proofing cyclizations by 1c-ms, the other protecting groups were removed to obtain the final crude target molecules, by treating the protected cyclized intermediates with a mixture of TFA, and scavengers. Preparative HPLC purification and lyophilization yielded the final purified peptide which was characterized by 1c-ms.",
                                "MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) assay was used to determine the binding affinity of CA to Pep-2-cyclic and PF74. MST is based on the thermophoresis, a directed movement of molecules in a temperature gradient, which depends on a variety of molecular properties including size, charge, hydration shell or conformation. Thus, it is highly sensitive to virtually any change in molecular properties, allowing for precise quantification of molecular events independent of the size or nature of the investigated sample (Jerabek-Willemsen, 2014). During the MST experiment, a temperature gradient is induced by an infrared laser. The directed movement of molecules through the temperature gradient is detected and quantified using covalently attached fluorophore. The binding isotherms obtained by plotting the difference in normalized fluorescence against increasing Pep-2-cyclic and PF74 concentration are shown in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, respectively. The binding affinities of Pep-2-cyclic (Kd.Pep-2-cyclic) and PF74 (Kd.PF74) with CA were extrapolated by fitting the data points to a quadratic equation (Equation 1). The Kd.Pep-2-cyclic from these data is 32\u00b13 nM, whereas the Kd.PF74 is 212\u00b17 nM. The binding affinity of CA-hexamers with PF74 was previously determined by isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to be 262 nM (Bhattacharya et al., 2014), which is in good agreement with the Kd.PF74 determined here using MST. These data suggest that Pep-2-cyclic binds CA with \u02dc7-fold greater affinity."
