# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce HIV/AIDS and cART
- describe HIV-capsid as antiviral target
- discuss CA inhibitors and their limitations

## SUMMARY

- introduce cyclic or linear peptide with specific amino acid sequence
- describe various aspects of the peptide, including binding to HIV-1 capsid protein

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Definitions
