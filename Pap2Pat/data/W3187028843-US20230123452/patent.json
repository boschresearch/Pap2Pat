                        "Rock is a typical heterogeneous material, with progressive deformation and failure. Understanding the progressive failure process of the rock is of great significance to many projects. However, the progressive damages of rock materials arising from initiation, propagation and coalescence of microcracks cannot be observed and quantized directly by scholars and engineers without other means. AE monitoring as a non-destructive monitoring technology has been widely applied to the fields of rock mechanics and rock engineering. The term AE refers to the generation of elastic waves due to release of strain energy from the rock in fracturing process. With further analysis on these elastic waves, various AE parameters such as AE count, AE energy and b value can be obtained to quantize the rock damage degrees, capture the rock instability precursors, and so on.",
                        "In view of defects of indoor AE experiments, numerical simulation methods for reproducing AE phenomena of the rock have been proved as a powerful approach to research the progressive fracturing process of the rock. Among various numerical simulation methods, particle flow code (PFC) has become one of mainstream software in the field of rock mechanics, because it can reproduce the initiation, propagation and coalescence of microcracks in the progressive fracturing process of the rock through a bonded-particle model (BPM), and can directly simulate large deformations of the rock materials. In the BPM, rock grains are simulated with non-uniform-sized circular stiff particles, and adhesive bonding behaviors between the rock grains are simulated with bonded contacts. Given that the bonded contacts have certain stiffnesses and strengths, motions of the particles meet the Newton's second law, and the force and moment on each bonded contact are updated with the motions of the particles, the microcracks are generated when the contact force exceeds the contact strength. With continuation of the loading, the microcracks are initiated and gathered and eventually the model is damaged.",
                        "In natural seismic and microseismic monitoring, when dynamic waves released from seismic sources are recorded, information of the seismic sources is often obtained by means of moment tensor inversion. In PFC simulation, the moment tensors can be obtained by recording variations of surrounding contact forces in bond failure, thus getting the magnitude and energy of the AE. The moment tensor analysis is unavailable to determine source positions and numbers of microcracks in single AE events at present."
