                "A significant portion of wood used in the construction industry is treated with metal based preservatives. This is done to protect the wood from attack by microbes and insects during service. The preservatives contain copper (II) and sometimes also chromium (VI) (as chromate) and arsenic (V) (as arsenic pentoxide). Other metal pollutants are also found in wood such as zinc (II), iron (II/III) and lead (II). The main applications for preservative treated wood are decks, fences, landscape architecture, playground equipment, docks, marinas, utility poles, bridges, highway sound barriers, roller coasters, wood foundations and mine shafts. These preservative formulations are toxic: copper (II) is toxic to aquatic life and arsenic (V) and chromium (VI) are known to be very toxic to any multicellular life including humans. Leaching from in-service-material is limited, although public health concerns have been raised. Apart from this, the non-degradability of the wood and toxicity of the preservatives pose a definitive problem when the wood is taken out of service.",
                "Common preservative formulations used are alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), copper azole (CA, Tanalith E) and micronized copper quaternary (MCQ), which all contain substantial amounts of copper (up to 3700 ppm). Chromated copper arsenate (CCA, Tanalith C), a mixture of CuO, CrO3 and As2O has been used extensively between the 1930s until the early 2000s. Timber treated with CCA can contain over 5000 mg kg\u22121 of arsenic (V) and chromium (VI). This is the most hazardous wood treatment, hence CCA use was heavily curtailed in Europe and the US in 2003-2004. However, CCA treated timber still in service will pose a substantial problem for the next 20-years. Reportedly, up to 2.5\u00d7106 m3 a\u22121 of spent CCA-treated wood will be removed from service in the next 20 years in Canada. It has been estimated that 6-10\u00d7106 m3 a\u22121 of CCA-treated wood waste will be produced in the USA by 2030.",
                "The treated timber is classified as hazardous waste and cannot be directly used in biomass-to-heat conversion or recycled into panel boards or similar, thus incurring high costs for specialist disposal, such as landfilling. Copper (II) only treated timber may be incinerated in monitored specialist boilers and the waste reduced to metal containing ash. In contrast, incineration of arsenic (V) containing wood is problematic, as the arsenic (V) compounds generated during thermal treatment are volatile and at least partially emitted into the atmosphere.",
                "The following recovery methods of the metal additives from the treated wood are in being used or currently explored:\n\n\n- - (1) Controlled landfill Landfills that are not in contact with the\n    ground water table are deemed suitable for disposal of treated wood\n    waste. However, landfill sites are becoming scarcer and landfilling\n    is becoming expensive.\n  - (2) Thermal treatment and disposal of metal enriched ash Boilers for\n    thermal treatment of hazardous timber are not operated in the UK due\n    to high demand on furnace specifications and monitoring (Regional\n    Market Assessment for Wood Waste for North East England, 2007).\n    However, thermal treatment may be feasible for wood treated with the\n    newer, copper only, preservatives. Copper compounds are non-volatile\n    and thus only a small percentage escapes as fly ash into the\n    atmosphere upon combustion of the contaminated biomass (less than\n    7%). Processes deriving value from combustion, gasification or\n    pyrolysis do not currently exist.\n  - (3) Leaching and disposal of chemically precipitated metal ions\n    Leaching of the oxidised metals from the wood has been proposed.\n    Options discussed in the literature are\n    - a. Leaching with dilute acid solution or aqueous solutions\n      containing chelating agents\n    - b. Complete dissolution of waste wood in concentrated sulfuric\n      acid\n  - \u2003The metal-containing effluents are treated as heavy metal\n    contaminated waste water (metal ions removed e.g. by flocculation\n    and precipitation). Recovered wood can be incinerated as normal\n    waste wood if the metal content is sufficiently low. The recovered\n    wood cannot be used as a source of biofuel as the wood is decomposed\n    during the process and not suitable for subsequent use in the\n    saccharification process. Electrodeposition of Cu^(II) from aqueous\n    solution has been demonstrated recently. A recent study presented\n    insights obtained from operating a pilot plant and the associated\n    techno-economic model for dilute acid-leaching. It was estimated\n    that the operating cost would be \\$250-289 t\u207b\u00b9 of treated wood. This\n    shows that metal extraction should be integrated with a value-adding\n    application.",
                "The mentioned decontamination methods for metal containing timber are costly, in the area of $180 t1 waste timber. On the other hand, cost of virgin wood feedstock for biofuel production is estimated to be $80 t\u22121. Currently, there are a handful of commercial-scale cellulosic biofuel plants in operation, all using virgin biomass (mostly agricultural residues and energy grasses) and steam based pre-treatment technologies.",
                "The use of contaminated waste wood as feedstock for a biorefinery would hence eliminate a waste management problem and increase the economic viability of lignocellulosic biomass for biofuel and biochemical production. Electrochemical recovery of the metals in a useful elemental form would further add value.",
                "Lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, consists of 3 major components arranged in an intricate, yet physically and chemically stable material. Approximately 40% of wood is cellulose. Cellulose is long chains of glucose arranged infibrils. They give wood its high strength and stiffness.",
                "Hemicellulose, 25 weight % of the material, acts as a filler matrix that binds the cellulose fibrils together. Lignin, also approximately 25% of the material, is a glue infused into the cellulose hemicellulose matrix, conferring elasticity and water-proofness. Cellulose and hemicellulose are long chains composed of sugars, while lignin's repeat units contain aromatic rings.",
                "For cellulosic biofuel production, the lignocellulosic matrix is opened up during pre-treatment/fractionation (at elevated temperature). A separate fraction of cellulose is obtained. The sugar molecules can be released from washed cellulose using an enzymatic hydrolysis step. The resulting sugar solution can be converted to biofuels or other biochemicals by fermentation. If a preservative treated lignocellulosic biomass source was used, the presence of the metals e.g. copper from the preservatives would kill the microbes used in the fermentation step. Therefore, only virgin (untreated) biomass sources have been used to date. The lignin present in the lignocellulosic biomass can be used for energy recovery and production of renewable materials such as resins, polyols, carbon fibres and chemicals, depending on the extraction conditions and purity.",
                "The fractionation of cellulose and lignin from lignocellulosic biomass using ionic liquids has been previously described in WO 2012/080702 and WO2014/140643.",
                "The present invention describes a process of extracting metals from treated cellulosic or lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, using an ionic liquid (IL). The ionic liquids fractionate metal containing cellulosic or lignocellulosic biomass waste into a cellulose rich solid material, and a liquid phase. The liquid phase comprises a hemicellulose fraction and a lignin fraction, and retains the metals in the IL solution. The cellulose rich material can be used to produce biofuels and plant derived chemicals. The metal, and optionally the lignin, can also be recovered from the IL, and the IL can be recycled.",
                "Thus in the first aspect the invention provides a process for the extraction of metal pollutants from treated cellulosic biomass comprising contacting the treated cellulosic biomass with an ionic liquid, said ionic liquid comprising an anion and an organic cation.

As described in the examples, pre-treatments with an ionic liquid of softwood impregnated with a copper-based preservative achieved up to 98% removal of the CuII in a single pass.",
                "The metal can be recovered from the IL, thereby providing an additional income stream, and by removing the metal pollutant increases the value of biomass utilised, as the cellulosic or lignocellulosic biomass will be converted from a negative-value waste into a positive-value fuel resource (FIG. 1). Cellulosic biofuel production and hazardous waste wood processing in one step has not been described previously.",
                "Ionic liquids are highly conductive solvents due to their ionic nature and regarded as superior media for the electrodeposition of metals and semiconductors. Key advantages that enable the ILs to overcome the limits imposed by common aqueous or organic media are their wide electrochemical windows, spanning up to 6 V in some cases; low vapour pressures, which allow electrodeposition at temperatures well above 100\u00b0 C., and numerous, only partly understood, cation/anion effects that make it possible to influence the morphology and crystal size of deposits. Electrodeposition is currently not practised for the recovery of metals from dilute heavy metal-containing IL waste streams.",
                "The process may preferably further comprise electrodeposition of the metal pollutant from the ionic liquid. The electrodeposition can be carried out by applying an appropriate current per unit electrode area from a transformer-rectifier, as used industrially for recovery of many metals from aqueous electrolyte solutions. Other suitable methods include chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry. Electrodeposition allows the metal pollutant to be recovered as a solid metal or alloy. Recovery of metals by electrodeposition provides an added revenue stream which could provide $10 worth (assuming a price of $5,000 (tonne Cu)\u22121) of Cu0 per tonne of treated wood (containing 2000 ppm of CuII). The electrical energy costs required for the process are estimated as an order of magnitude lower than the value of the recovered copper. The process also eliminates the need to landfill metal containing ashes. In addition recycling of metals may contribute to a reduced reliance on foreign imports of metals (strengthen local resource resilience) and also reduce the environmental impact of mining.",

The majority of cellulose remains solid, preferably at least 90%, more preferably 95%. It can be easily removed from the liquid phase mechanically, for example by filtration. The separated solid residue or pulp can then be washed and used in the saccharification process. This removes the need for a separate precipitation step to obtain the cellulose once the biomass has been treated. Thus the method of the invention may preferably further comprise the step of separating the ionic liquid from the cellulose containing solid residue produced in step (a) from the ionic liquid.",

The separation efficiency and the ionic liquid recovery can be enhanced by washing the cellulose containing solid residue with ionic liquid or an organic solvent that is miscible with the ionic liquid. Examples of suitable organic solvents include aliphatic alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. After washing, the organic solvent can be separated from the cellulose containing solid residue, and added to the ionic liquid from step (a). The organic solvent is removed before or potentially after the lignin is precipitated. The organic solvent can be removed from the ionic liquid using conventional methods known to the skilled person. For example the volatile organic solvents can be removed by distillation.",

The almost dry IL (2 wt % water) shows very small currents at very reducing potentials, suggesting that the ionic liquid is electrochemically stable under these conditions. The higher water content ILs exhibit higher current densities due to the occurrence of water reduction leading to hydrogen evolution.
