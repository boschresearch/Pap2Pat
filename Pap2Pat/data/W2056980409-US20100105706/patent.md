# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of preventing airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation using A2B adenosine receptor antagonists. This invention finds utility in the treatment and prevention of asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and other pulmonary diseases. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions for use in the method.

## BACKGROUND

According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and the National Pharmaceutical Council, an estimated 17 million Americans currently suffer from asthma. It is the most common chronic childhood disease, affecting more than one child in 20, nearly 5 million children in all, and it is the only chronic disease, besides AIDS and tuberculosis, with an increasing death rate. Each year over 5,000 Americans die from asthma.

The annual cost of asthma in 1998 was estimated to be $11.3 billion. Direct costs accounted for $7.5 billion and indirect costs were $3.8 billion. Hospitalizations accounted for the single largest portion of the cost and amount to nearly a half million hospitalizations, 1.6 million emergency room visits, and over 10 million office visits. Clearly there is a great need for new methods of treating the condition.

As discussed by Elias et al. (1999), J. Clin. Inv., 104(8):1001-1006, the effects of airway remodeling in the development of asthma were previously unknown as the condition was thought to be an entirely reversible disorder. More recent investigations have revealed, however, that significant airway remodeling occurs during asthma and that the degree of this remodeling is usually proportional to symptom severity. Remodeling typically takes the form of airway wall thickening, the development of subepithelial fibrosis, increased myocyte muscle mass, myofibroblast hyperplasia, and mucus metaplasia. Airway remodeling is also a common factor in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary inflammation is also a common component in the development of airway remodeling and may be typified by bronchiolitis, alveolitis, and/or vasculitis.

The correlation between airway remodeling and asthma presents a new avenue of asthma research. Recently the ability of cortical steroids and leukotrine receptor antagonists to prevent or treat airway remodeling has been reported (see Hoshino (2004) Clin Rev Allergy Immunol. 27(1):59-64). Given the potential negative side effects of long term treatment with cortical steroids and the uncertainties regarding the efficacy of leukotrine receptor antagonists, the exists a strong need for other methods of inhibiting airway remodeling.

Adenosine is known to play a role in asthma and COPD (See, Spicuzza et al. (2003) TiPS 24(8):409-4130; Mann et al, (1986) J Appl Physiol 61:1667-1676; and Feoktistov et al, (1998) Trends Pharmacol Sci 19:148-153.) The clinical evidence supporting the involvement of adenosine includes:


- - 1) Plasma concentrations of adenosine are increased by allergen
    challenge in asthmatic patients and adenosine levels in the
    bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are elevated in asthmatic and COPD
    patients (Driver et al, (1993). *Am Rev Respir Dis* 148:91-97)
  - 2) Adenosine (given as AMP) induces bronchoconstriction in
    asthmatics but not in normal subjects (Cushley et al, (1983) *Br J
    Clin Pharmacol* 15:161-165), and it increases the concentrations of
    mediators released from mast cells, such as histamine, tryptase,
    LTC4 and PDG2 (Crimi et al, (1997) *Allergy* 52:48-54). The
    adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction is attenuated by drugs that
    either inhibit mast cell activation or serve as antagonists to the
    mediators released from the mast cells. Thus, the potential
    mechanism of adenosine-induced bronchoconstriction is likely due to
    its effect on mast cell activation (Polosa et al, (2002) *Thorax*
    57:649-654 and Polosa (2002) *Eur Respir J* 20:488-496.).
  - 3) Adenosine has also been shown to induce eosinophilia and
    inflammation. The overall effects and potential clinical utilities
    of AMP-challenge are summarized in a recent review article by
    Spicuzza and Polosa, (2003) *Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol*
    3:65-69.

Adenosine is a naturally occurring nucleoside, which exerts its biological effects by interacting with a family of adenosine receptors known as A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, all of which modulate important physiological processes. Of the various receptors, A2B adenosine receptors are believed to be most significantly involved in asthma via their connection to mast cell activation, vasodilation, and regulation of cell growth (See Adenosine A2B Receptors as Therapeutic Targets, Drug Dev Res 45:198; Feoktistov et al., Trends Pharmacol Sci 19:148-153). Specifically, adenosine A2B receptor antagonists have been shown to affect the activation of mast cell and have thus been implicated in the inhibition of the acute airway hyperresponsiveness. Surprisingly, it has now been found that A2B adenosine receptor antagonists are also useful in the prevention of airway remodeling and pulmonary inflammation.

Accordingly, it is desired to provide a method of preventing airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation by administration of compounds that are potent, fully or partially selective, A2B antagonists, i.e., compounds that inhibit the A2B adenosine receptor.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for the treatment and prevention of airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an A2B receptor antagonist to a mammal that is genetically and/or environmentally predisposed to airway remodeling and pulmonary inflammation.

In another embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for the treatment and prevention of airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation by administration to a mammal that is genetically and/or environmentally predisposed to airway remodeling, a therapeutically effective amount of an A2B receptor antagonist having the structure of Formula I or Formula II:

wherein:


- R¹ and R² are independently chosen from hydrogen, optionally
  substituted alkyl, or a group -D-E, in which D is a covalent bond or
  alkylene, and E is optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally
  substituted cycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally
  substituted heteroaryl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl,
  optionally substituted alkenyl or optionally substituted alkynyl, with
  the proviso that when D is a covalent bond E cannot be alkoxy;
- R³ is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted
  cycloalkyl;
- X is optionally substituted arylene or optionally substituted
  heteroarylene;
- Y is a covalent bond or alkylene in which one carbon atom can be
  optionally replaced by —O—, —S—, or —NH—, and is optionally
  substituted by hydroxy, alkoxy, optionally substituted amino, or —COR,
  in which R is hydroxy, alkoxy or amino; and
- Z is optionally substituted monocyclic aryl or optionally substituted
  monocyclic heteroaryl; or
- Z is hydrogen when X is optionally substituted heteroarylene and Y is
  a covalent bond.

In yet another embodiment of the invention, pharmaceutical formulations are provided, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an A2B receptor antagonist, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The formulation is preferably for oral administration.

One preferred group of compounds of Formula I and H are those in which R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, optionally substituted lower alkyl, or a group -D-E, in which D is a covalent bond or alkylene, and E is optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl, or optionally substituted alkynyl, particularly those in which R3 is hydrogen.

Within this group, a first preferred class of compounds include those in which R1 and R2 are independently lower alkyl optionally substituted by cycloalkyl, preferably n-propyl, and X is optionally substituted phenylene. Within this class, a preferred subclass of compounds are those in which Y is alkylene, including alkylene in which a carbon atom is replaced by oxygen, preferably —O—CH2—, more especially where the oxygen is the point of attachment to phenylene. Within this subclass, it is preferred that Z is optionally substituted oxadiazole, particularly optionally substituted [1,2,4]-oxadiazol-3-yl, especially [1,2,4]-oxadiazol-3-yl substituted by optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted pyridyl.

A second preferred class of compounds include those in which X is optionally substituted 1,4-pyrazolene. Within this class, a preferred subclass of compounds are those in which Y is a covalent bond or alkylene, especially lower alkylene, and Z is hydrogen, optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted pyridyl, or optionally substituted oxadiazole. Within this subclass, one preferred embodiment includes compounds in which R1 is lower alkyl optionally substituted by cycloalkyl, and R2 is hydrogen.

Within this subclass, also preferred are those compounds in which R1 and R2 are independently lower alkyl optionally substituted by cycloalkyl, especially n-propyl. More preferred are those compounds in which Y is a covalent bond, —(CH2)— or —CH(CH3)— and Z is hydrogen, optionally substituted phenyl, or optionally substituted pyridyl, particularly where Y is a covalent bond and Z is hydrogen.

At present, the preferred compounds for use in the invention include, but are not limited to:

### Nomenclature

The naming and numbering of the compounds of the invention is illustrated with a representative compound of Formula I in which R1 is n-propyl, R2 is n-propyl, R3 is hydrogen, X is phenylene, Y is —O—(CH2), and Z is 5-(2-methoxyphenyl)-[1,2,4]-oxadiazol-3-yl,

which is named:

### The Method of the Invention

The present invention relates to methods of preventing airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a A2B adenosine receptor antagonist to a mammal having a condition that produces or is caused by such airway remodeling. As airway remodeling and pulmonary inflammation are significant components of asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and COPD, the method of the invention will generally involve administration of an A2B adenosine receptor antagonist to a patient suffering from either asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, and/or COPD.

The A2B adenosine receptor antagonist is administered systemically as an oral formulation but may also be administered directly to the pulmonary tissue via an inhaler. This administration can be as a single dose or as repeated doses given at multiple designated intervals. It will readily be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the preferred dosage regimen will vary with the patient and severity of the condition being treated.

### Pharmaceutical Compositions

When selected as the adenosine A2B receptor antagonist, the compounds of Formula I are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. This invention therefore provides pharmaceutical compositions that contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, including inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, including sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, solubilizers and adjuvants. The compounds of Formula I may be administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Co., Philadelphia, Pa. 17th Ed. (1985) and “Modern Pharmaceutics”, Marcel Dekker, Inc. 3rd Ed. (G. S. Banker & C. T. Rhodes, Eds.).

### The A2B Adenosine Receptor Antagonists

Any A2B adenosine receptor antagonist may be used in the method of the invention. Numerous compounds that antagonize the A2B receptor are known in the art, as are methods for determining if a specific compound has such activity. For example, a review article by Feoktistov and Baggioni, ((1997) Pharmacological Reviews 49:381-402) reports the binding affinity of eight adenosine receptor agonists and eight antagonists for all four subtypes of adenosine receptors. References cited therein provide detailed descriptions of the procedures used. (Robeva et al, (1996) J. Drug Dev, Res 39:243-252; Jacobson et al (1996) Drug Dev. Res, 39:289-300; Feoktistov and Baggioni (1993) Molecular Pharmacology 43:909-914). Effective methods for determining the binding affinity of a compound for a receptor use a radiolabelled agonist or antagonist and correlation of the binding of that compound to a membrane fraction known to contain that receptor; for example, to determine whether a compound is an A2B antagonist, the membrane fraction would contain the A2B adenosine receptor. Another particularly effective procedure for determining whether a compound is an A2B antagonist is reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,081.

Compounds selective for the A2B receptor subtype are therefore preferred for the present methods. An example, but not a limitation, of such a compound is 3-n-propylxanthine (enprofylline). Suitable compounds are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,545,002. Compounds that antagonize other receptors in addition to the A2B receptor are also suitable for use in the present invention. One example of such a compound is 1,3-dipropyl-8-(p-acrylic)phenylxanthine.

One particularly preferred class of A2B adenosine receptor antagonists are those disclosed in copending and commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,825,349 and in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/719,102, which published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040176399. The compounds disclosed in that application have the structure of Formula I and Formula II as presented in the Summary of the Invention above and can be synthesized as described in the references or as detailed below.

### Utility Testing and Administration

**General Utility**

The method and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are effective in the prevention of airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation in a mammal that is predisposed to airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation. The predisposition may be due to genetic abnormalities, disease states, and/or environmental conditions that have been shown to induce airway remodeling and/or pulmonary inflammation.

**Testing**

Activity testing is conducted as described in those patents and patent applications referenced above, and in the Examples below, and by methods apparent to one skilled in the art.

**Administration**

The compounds of Formula I may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, for example as described in those patents and patent applications incorporated by reference, including buccal, intranasal, intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, or as an inhalant.

Oral administration is the preferred route for administration of the compounds of Formula I. Administration may be via capsule or enteric coated tablets, or the like. In making the pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound of Formula I, the active ingredient is usually diluted by an excipient and/or enclosed within such a carrier that can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, in can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material (as above), which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.

Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents.

The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art. Controlled release drug delivery systems for oral administration include osmotic pump systems and dissolutional systems containing polymer-coated reservoirs or drug-polymer matrix formulations. Examples of controlled release systems are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 4,326,525; 4,902514; and 5,616,345. Another formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (“patches”). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.

Adenosine A2B receptor antagonists such as the compounds of Formula I are effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. Typically, for oral administration, each dosage unit contains from 1 mg to 2 g of an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist, more commonly from 1 to 700 mg, and for parenteral administration, from 1 to 700 mg of an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist, more commonly about 2 to 200 mg. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the adenosine A2B receptor antagonist actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.

For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules.

The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action, or to protect from the acid conditions of the stomach. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.

Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine, Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.

The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

**Characterization of A2B Antagonists**

**Radioligand Binding for A2B Adenosine Receptor**

Human A2B adenosine receptor cDNA was stably transfected into HEK-293 cells (referred to as HEK-A2B cells). Monolayers of HEK-A2B cells were washed with PBS once and harvested in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors. These cells were homogenized in polytron for 1 minute at setting 4 and centrifuged at 29000 g for 15 minutes at 4° C. The cell pellets were washed once with a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH7.4), 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors, and were resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 10% sucrose. Frozen aliquots were kept at −80° C.

Competition assays were started by mixing 10 nM 3H-ZM241385 (Tocris Cookson) with various concentrations of test compounds and 50 μg membrane proteins in TE buffer (50 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1 Unit/mL adenosine deaminase. The assays were incubated for 90 minutes, stopped by filtration using Packard Harvester and washed four times with ice-cold TM buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). Non specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM ZM241385. The affinities of compounds (I.e. Ki values) were calculated using GraphPad software.

**Radioligand Binding for Other Adenosine Receptors**

Human A1, A2A, A3 adenosine receptor cDNAs were stably transfected into either CHO or HEK-293 cells (referred to as CHO-A1, HEK-A2A, CHO-A3). Membranes were prepared from these cells using the same protocol as described above. Competition assays were started by mixing 0.5 nM 3H-CPX (for CHO-A1), 2 nM 3H-ZM214385 (HEK-A2A) or 0.1 nM 125I-AB-MECA (CHO-A3) with various concentrations of test compounds and the perspective membranes in TE buffer (50 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA of CHO-A1 and HEK-A2A) or TEM buffer (50 mM. Tris, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM MgCl2 for CHO-A3) supplemented with 1 Unit/mL adenosine deaminase. The assays were incubated for 90 minutes, stopped by filtration using Packard Harvester and washed four times with ice-cold TM buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). Non specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μM CPX (CHO-A1), 1 μM ZM241385 (HEK-A2A) and 1 μM IB-MECA (CHO-A3). The affinities of compounds (I.e. Ki values) were calculated using GraphPad™ software.

cAMP Measurements

Monolayer of transfected cells were collected in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA. Cells were washed once with DMEM and resuspended in DMEM containing 1 Unit/mL adenosine deaminase at a density of 100,000-500,000 cells/ml. 100 μl of the cell suspension was mixed with 25 μl containing various agonists and/or antagonists and the reaction was kept at 37° C. for 15 minutes. At the end of 15 minutes, 125 μl 0.2N HCl was added to stop the reaction. Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm. 100 μl of the supernatant was removed and acetylated. The concentrations of cAMP in the supernatants were measured using the direct cAMP assay from Assay Design. A2A and A2B adenosine receptors are coupled to Gs proteins and thus agonists for A2A adenosine receptor (such as CGS21680) or for A2A adenosine receptor (such as NECA) increase the cAMP accumulations whereas the antagonists to these receptors prevent the increase in cAMP accumulations-induced by the agonists. A1 and A3 adenosine receptors are coupled to Gi proteins and thus agonists for A1 adenosine receptor (such as CPA) or for A3 adenosine receptor (such as IB-MECA) inhibit the increase in cAMP accumulations-induced by forskolin. Antagonists to A1 and A3 receptors prevent the inhibition in cAMP accumulations.

**Example 21**

**Effect of A2B Antagonist on Airway Restructuring in Mouse Model**

The model system being used is the adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mouse model of adenosine-dependent pulmonary injury. In this model, elevations in adenosine are associated with increased pulmonary inflammation and airway remodeling. Many of the features seen in these mice resemble those observed in patients with various forms of chronic lung disease including severe asthma, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. The approach is to treat these mice with the A2B AR antagonist 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione as a means to probe A2B AR contributions to pulmonary inflammation and injury in ADA-deficient mice, which should provide insight into the efficacy of this drug for the treatment of chronic lung diseases.

Mice treated by intraperitoneal (ip) injection twice daily with 1 mg/kg 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione. The specific protocol is as follows: ADA-deficient (ADA−/−) or ADA containing (ADA+) mice were identified at birth by screening of ADA enzymatic activity in the blood. ADA−/− mice were maintained on ADA enzyme therapy from postnatal day 2 until postnatal day 21. At this stage, treatments with 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione or vehicle controls (corn oil/ethanol/DMSO) were initiated. Treatments consisted of an ip injection in the morning (8-9 AM) and in the evening (5-6 pm). Treatments were given daily for 17 days, and the experiment was terminated on postnatal day 38. Treatment groups included ADA−/− or ADA+ mice receiving 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione, vehicle, or no treatment. All mice were littermates and were therefore strain matched. Both males and females were included in these experiments. At the termination of the experiment, serum was collected for pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione levels and various pulmonary endpoints were examined.

Results from these studies indicate that treatment of ADA−/− mice with 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione resulted in a significant reduction in pulmonary inflammation and airway destruction. Perhaps the most dramatic observation from this study was the general health of the animals at the end of the treatment protocol. ADA−/− mice either treated with vehicle or untreated exhibited outward signs of severe respiratory distress that included rapid breathing and hunched posture. These features were not observed in ADA−/− mice treated with 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione.

**Methods:**

**Mice**

ADA-deficient mice were generated and genotyped as described (Blackburn et al. (1998) J Biol Chem 273:5093-5100 and Young et al. (2004) J. Immunol. 173:1380-1389. Mice homozygous for the null Ada allele were designated ADA-deficient (ADA−/−), while mice heterozygous for the null Ada allele were designated as ADA control mice (ADA+). All mice were on a mixed 129sv/C57BL/6J background and all phenotypic comparisons were performed amongst littermates. Animal care was in accordance with institutional and NIH guidelines. Mice were housed in ventilated cages equipped with microisolator lids and maintained under strict containment protocols. No evidence of bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection was found, and serologies on cage littermates were negative for 12 of the most common murine viruses.

**Cellular Differentials and Histology**

Mice were anesthetized with avertin, and lungs were lavaged four times with 0.3 ml PBS, and 0.95-1 ml of pooled lavage fluid was recovered. Total cell counts were determined using a hemocytometer, and aliquots were cytospun onto microscope slides and stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Nehring) for cellular differentials. Lungs were then infused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 25 cm of pressure and then fixed overnight at 4° C. Fixed lung samples were rinsed in PBS, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 μm) were collected on microscope slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Shandon-Lipshaw) or Masson's trichrome (EM Science), according to manufacturer's instructions.

Analysis of mRNA

Mice were anesthetized and the lungs were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated from frozen lung tissue using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, N.Y., USA). RNA samples were then DNase treated and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The primers, probes and procedures for real-time RT-PCR were described previously in Sun et al. (2005) J Clin Invest 115:35-43. Reactions were carried out on a Smart Cycler rapid thermal cycler system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Specific transcript levels were determined using Smart Cycler analysis software through comparison to a standard curve generated from the PCR amplification of template dilutions.

**Collagen Quantification**

The Sircol collagen assay (Biocolor Ltd., Belfast N. Ireland) was performed on snap frozen whole lungs. Lungs were homogenized in 5 ml. 0.5M. Acetic acid with 20 mg of pepsin and incubated with shaking for 24 hrs at 4° C. Homogenate was spun at 4000 rpm and supernatant was assayed for pepsin soluble collagen according to manufacture's instructions.

**α-SMA and TGF-β1 Immunohistochemistry**

Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 μm sections cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded lungs. Sections were rehydrated through graded ethanols to water, endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide, antigen retrieval was performed (DAKO Corp., Carpenteria, Calif.), and endogenous avidin and biotin was blocked with the Biotin Blocking System (DAKO Corp.). For a-smooth muscle actin (sma) staining, slides were processed with the Mouse on Mouse Kit, and the ABC Elite Streptavidin Reagents (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a a-sma monoclonal antibody (Sigma, monoclonal clonel A-4) overnight at 4° C. Sections were developed with DAB (Sigma) and counterstained with Methyl Green.

**Determination of Alveolar Airspace Size**

The size of alveolar airways was determined in pressure infused lungs by measuring mean chord lengths on H&E-stained lung sections (Blackburn et al. (2000) J Exp Med 192:159-170). Representative images were digitized, and a grid consisting of 53 black lines at 10.5-μm intervals was overlaid on the image. This line grid was subtracted from the lung images using Image-Pro® Plus (Media Cybernetics) image analysis software, and the resultant lines were measured and averaged to give the mean chord length of the alveolar airways. The final mean chord lengths represent averages from 10 non-overlapping images of each lung specimen. All quantitative studies were performed blinded with regards to animal genotype.

**Results**

**Histological Analysis**

Histological analysis of lungs are shown in FIG. 1. The lungs of ADA−/− mice treated with vehicle exhibited significant alveolar airway simplification (FIG. 1B) and increased pulmonary inflammation that consisted predominantly of accumulation of activated macrophages in the distal airways (FIG. 1E). However, peribronchial/perivascular inflammation was also evident (not shown). Alveolar airway simplification and pulmonary inflammation was not evident in ADA+ vehicle treated (FIGS. 1A and D) or 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione or untreated mice (not shown). Treatment of ADA−/− mice with the adenosine A2B receptor antagonist resulted in a significant decrease in alveolar airway simplification (FIG. 1C) and pulmonary inflammation (FIG. 1F). These findings indicate that treatment with an A2B adenosine receptor antagonist can prevent the development of pulmonary inflammation and airway destruction in ADA−/− mice.

**Bronchiolalveolar Lavage Analysis**

Bronchiolalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and airway cell counts and differentials were determined (FIG. 2). Results revealed that there was a significant reduction in the number of total cells recovered from BAL of ADA−/− mice treated with the A2B adenosine receptor antagonist as compared to vehicle treated ADA−/− mice (FIG. 2A). Analysis of cellular differentials from BALs revealed a reduction in all cell types examined including lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils (FIG. 2C) and alveolar macrophages (FIG. 2B) in ADA−/− mice treated with the A2B adenosine receptor antagonist.

Examination of alveolar macrophages within the lungs of ADA−/− mice with and without A2B adenosine receptor antagonist treatment indicate that there was a difference in the degree of alveolar macrophage activation (compare FIGS. 1E and F). These observations were confirmed by quantifying the number of activated macrophages recovered from the BAL (FIG. 2C). In addition, reduction in alveolar macrophage activation can be appreciated by directly examining BAL cells cytospun onto microscope slides (FIG. 3). These data demonstrate that there is a significant decrease in airway inflammation in ADA−/− mice treated with an A2B adenosine receptor antagonist showing that A2BAR antagonism can prevent airway inflammation in mammals that are genetically and/or environmentally predisposed to airway remodeling.

**Effect on Inflammatory Markers**

The ability of adenosine A2B antagonist treatment to dampen the degree of pulmonary inflammation in ADA−/− mice prompted the examination of the levels of key cytokines and chemokines. Whole lung RNA extracts from ADA+ and ADA−/− mice treated with vehicle or an A2B adenosine receptor antagonist were analyzed. IL-5, IL-4, TNFα, RANTES and various monocyte chemoatraetant proteins (MCPs) were found to be elevated in the lungs of ADA−/− mice treated with vehicle; however their levels did not change with A2B adenosine receptor antagonist treatment. In contrast, IL-6, Eotaxin I and TARC were elevated in vehicle treated ADA−/− mice and their levels were significantly lower in ADA−/− mice treated with the A2B adenosine receptor antagonist. As shown in FIG. 4, these findings demonstrate that A2BAR antagonism in ADA−/− mice is able to prevent the expression of certain but not all pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

**The Effect on Myofibroblast Accumulation**

Previous studies have demonstrated that ADA−/− mice develop pulmonary fibrosis in conjunction with adenosine elevations. To determine the effect of an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist treatment on pulmonary fibrosis in ADA−/− mice the status of pulmonary myofibroblasts were examined by staining for α-smooth muscle actin (α-sma) (FIG. 5). No α-sma positive cells were seen in the distal airways of ADA+ vehicle treated mice (FIG. 5A), whereas α-sma staining was prominent in the distal airways of vehicle treated ADA−/− mice (FIG. 5B). Few to no α-sma positive cells were seen in the distal airways of ADA−/− mice treated with an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist (FIG. 5C), suggesting A2BAR antagonism can prevent the accumulation of myofibroblasts in the lung of ADA−/− mice.

**Effects on Collagen Deposition**

Previous work in the ADA−/− model has demonstrated that ADA−/− mice develop severe pulmonary fibrosis in conjunction with adenosine elevations. To determine the effect of A2B adenosine receptor antagonist treatment on fibrosis in ADA−/− mice we examined the degree of collagen deposition using Mason's trichrome staining (FIG. 6). Examination of collagen deposition revealed that there was little to no collagen deposition in the lungs of ADA+ vehicle or adenosine A2B receptor antagonist treated mice (FIGS. 6A and B), whereas distal airway collagen deposition was prominent in vehicle treated ADZ mice (FIG. 6C). Treatment of ADA−/− mice with the adenosine A2B receptor antagonist 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione resulted in a reduction in collagen deposition in the airways (FIG. 6D). Collagen production was measured by quantifying whole lung α1-procollagen transcript levels (FIG. 6E) and collagen protein levels in BAL fluid (FIG. 6F). Significant increases in collagen production were seen in the lungs of ADA−/− mice treated with vehicle, and these increases were largely prevented by CVT-6883 treatment. These findings demonstrate that adenosine A2B receptor antagonists can prevent the development of fibrosis in ADA−/− mice and implicate A2BAR signaling in the regulation of pulmonary fibrosis.

**Reduction in Profibrotic Mediators**

TGF-β1, osteopontin (OPN) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are pro-fibrotic mediators that have been shown to be elevated in the lungs of ADA−/− mice (Chunn et al (2005) J Immunol 175:1937-1946). The levels of these fibrotic regulators were elevated in the lungs of ADA−/− mice treated with vehicle, while adenosine A2B receptor antagonist treatment decreased expression of these molecules (FIG. 7). These findings suggest that A2BAR antagonism can prevent the expression of key regulators of fibrosis in the lungs of ADA−/− mice.

**Normalization of Protease/Anti-Protease Levels**

Increased levels of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibitors of proteases are features of distal airway enlargement in many models including ADA−/− mice (Sun et al. (2005) J Clin Invest 115:35-43, Hautamaki et al. (1997) Science 277:2002-2004, Lanone et al. (2002) J Clin Invest 110:463-474). Examination of anti-proteases and proteases in the lungs of ADA−/− mice treated with vehicle demonstrated an increase in the expression of TIMP-1, MMP-9 and MMP-12 (FIG. 8). Treatment of ADA−/− mice with an adenosine A2B receptor antagonist led to diminished expression of all three of these regulators of alveolar integrity, suggesting that A2BAR signaling is involved in regulating adenosine-induced protease and anti-protease expression in the lungs of ADA−/− mice.

**Effects on Alveolar Destruction**

ADA−/− mice develop features of distal airway enlargement characteristic of emphysema that are mediated by elevations in lung adenosine levels. To examine the effect of 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione on the distal airway enlargement seen in ADA−/− mice, alveolar destruction was assessed histologically and by determining mean cord length size of the distal airways (FIG. 9). The airways of ADA+ animals were well ordered and small when viewed histologically (FIG. 9A). ADA−/− airways were enlarged (FIG. 9B) and treatment of ADA−/− mice with 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione prevented this enlargement (FIG. 9C). Quantification of distal airway size agreed with the histological observations (FIG. 9D). These data demonstrate that treatment of ADA−/− mice with 3-ethyl-1-propyl-8-(1-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}(4-hydropyrazol-4-yl))-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6-dione can prevent the alveolar airway destruction seen in ADA−/− mice
