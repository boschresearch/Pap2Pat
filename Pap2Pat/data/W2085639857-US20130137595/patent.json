                        "In the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Kaposi sarcoma (KS) were the first malignancies used to define acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). People with HIV infection are also at increased risk of a number of other cancers. As people with HIV infection live longer due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of these non-AIDS-defining cancers has increased among HIV-infected individuals. One of the most common of these malignancies is Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and it has been estimated that people with HIV/AIDS have a 5.6- to 14.7-fold increased risk of developing HL compared to the general population.",
                        "HL is a solid tumor that is comprised of no more than 2% of the cancerous B lymphocytes. Instead, these lymphocytes secrete a wide range of cytokines that attract numerous normal leukocytes that then comprise the large majority of the tumor. Thus, HL is largely seen as an uncontrolled inflammatory disease. In people with immunosuppression, HL is believed to result from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is present in nearly all adults, but typically only causes HL when the immune system is suppressed, such as with HIV infection.",
                        "The increase in non-AIDS-defining cancers has created a greater need for the early detection of these malignancies in this susceptible population. It seems likely that HIV-infected individuals would benefit from a routine, non-invasive screen for HL, but no such screen exists. Rather, HL patients are identified after they become symptomatic. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been shown to be very effective at causing HL remission, but morbidity and mortality associated with these treatments is substantial. Early-stage HL is generally treated less intensively, suggesting that early detection of HL would result in less treatment-related toxicity. Cancer treatment strategies for HIV-infected individuals with HL are the same as for non-AIDS subject, but HIV-infected patients require additional vigorous supportive care (HAART, antifungals, neutrophil-simulating growth factors).",
                        "What is needed is a blood-based test to detect lymphoma earlier, when the tumor burden is much smaller, which would allow for less severe therapy and reduce long-term mortality and morbidity associated with current treatments."

The control subjects\n    (HIV-infected without HL) were chosen to approximately match the\n    cases (HIV-infected with HL) based on gender and age (Table 1). In\n    most cases, plasma samples were collected from HIV-infected subjects\n    with HL that had not received HL chemotherapy within at least 30\n    days (n=12). Information on chemotherapy was unknown for some cases\n    (n=9) and one sample was known to have been collected within 30 days\n    of chemotherapy. For all processing and analytical steps, samples\n    were blocked based on HL status and randomized.

The mobile phase consisted of 0.2% acetic acid and 0.05% trifluoroacetate in water (A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetate in 90% acetonitrile, 10% water (B). After loading 5 \u03bcL (2.5 \u03bcg total) of peptides onto the column, the mobile phase was held at 100% A for 50 min. Exponential gradient elution was performed by increasing the mobile phase composition from 0 to 55% B over 115 min. The HPLC column was coupled to the mass spectrometer by an in-house manufactured electrospray ionization interface. The heated capillary inlet temperature and electrospray voltage were 200\u00b0 C. and 2.2 kV, respectively. Data were acquired for 100 min, beginning 65 min after sample injection (15 min into start of buffer B gradient).

The data-analysis process first removed peptides for which there were insufficient identifications to perform a statistical analysis, which reduced the peptide number to 3814. Next, the peptide abundance measurements were normalized via regression based on all the peptide signals for that mass spectrometer run and then averaged across replicate runs for each sample. The averaged signal intensities were normalized for each sample based on the median absolute deviation of the signal intensity for all peptides identified in each sample. Finally, the data were subjected to two statistical tests to determine peptides having differential abundance due to either signal intensities or presence-absence. A non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was performed using MatLab 2009 to compare signal intensities. Differences in detection incidence was determined using a modified Chi-square test, called a G-test. Using either test, 647 peptides were identified with a p-value of 0.05 or less.",

                                "To identify potential circulating biomarkers for HL in a susceptible population, we used the AMT tag LC-MS approach to compare the plasma proteomes from 36 HIV-infected patients with or without HL. The HIV-infected patients without HL served as the control group to identify protein changes associated with HL. The relatively high-throughput characteristics of this approach enabled duplicate analyses of each of the 36 plasma samples, thereby improving data quality. The subject characteristics are described in Table 1. The proteomics analysis identified 3814 peptides across all of the samples, which corresponded to 629 proteins. Of these 3814 peptides, 647 were significantly different between the two disease states, which corresponded to 152 proteins (Tables S1 and S2). Sixty of these proteins met our criteria of being both significantly different between the two groups and having at least 1.5-fold difference in the normalized signal (Table S3). This protein list included well-known acute-phase inflammatory proteins, including C-reactive protein and serum amyloid proteins. To better identify common biological functions within these 60 proteins, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was utilized. In general, proteins that were associated with immune responses and cancer were highly represented in the list of significantly altered biological functions. Many of the proteins we identified are known to be secreted by white blood cells, such as those that infiltrate HL tumors, or by the liver, an important component of the reticuloendothelial system (Table S3). Similarly, the use of IPA to identify common biological functions across the 60 proteins identified \u201cinflammatory response\u201d and \u201ccancer\u201d (Table 2), suggesting that these proteins have a biological relationship with HL. Since only 1% to 2% of the mass of an HL tumor is composed of the cancerous lymphocytes, it may be that the proteins we identified did not originate from these relatively rare cells. Rather, these proteins may be the product of a systemic inflammatory response associated with HL or due to noncancerous leukocytes that form \u02dc99% of the tumor mass.",
                                "At least three of the proteins we identified have been previously reported to be increased in HL subjects compared to healthy controls, including C-reactive protein, beta-2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase. These prior studies examined HL in the general population, and did not focus on HIV-positive subjects. In addition, these studies measured these proteins by immunoassay, providing analytical verification as well. In the current study, the presence of HIV in the study population could be a confounding factor. For example, the HL subjects appeared to have slightly more advanced cases of HIV, on the average, as suggested by a trend (p=0.07, t-test) towards lower CD4-positive cell counts (Table 1), a result which is consistent with slightly more advanced immunosuppression. Even so, since three of the proteins we identified are increased in HL subjects without HIV, it seems clear that the results for these proteins, at least, are not confounded by differential states of HIV infection. Overall, the present study independently validates three plasma biomarkers for HL and identifies an additional 57 novel plasma proteins that appear to be promising candidate biomarkers based on their relationships with cancer and inflammation. These candidate biomarkers remain to be validated in regards to their association with HL.",
