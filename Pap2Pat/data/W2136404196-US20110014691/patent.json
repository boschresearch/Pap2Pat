                "Heart failure is becoming a predominant disease and a leading cause of death in most of developed countries. Regardless of the origin of myocardial failure (i.e, ischemic or genetic), the clinical symptoms result mainly from the death of cardiomyocytes replaced by a fibrotic and non contractile tissue. Pharmacological approaches to cure or relieve heart failure have been facing limitations. Because of a limited regeneration capability of the heart [1] and a shortage in donors for heart transplantation, an external source of cells has been envisioned as a therapeutic solution to bring a gain in function to diseased myocardium. For the last few years, hematopoietic stem cells had raised many hopes as a potential autologous cell source to repair diseased myocardium. However, the enthusiasm generated by the early non-controlled phase I studies has been dampened by the more recent recognition that out of four randomised controlled trials entailing intracoronary infusions of bone marrow-derived cells shortly after myocardial infarction, three failed to meet their primary end point, i.e., an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction [2-5]. Combined with basic studies disproving the cardiogenic potential of these cells [6-7], the outcome of these trials demonstrates that these cells do not really regenerate the diseased myocardium and it is unlikely that their paracrine effects may be sufficient for restoring function of extensively scarred myocardium [8]. The same limitations apply to skeletal myoblasts [9]. Thus, these findings call for another stem cell source to achieve myocardial regeneration. Among various other cell types, embryonic stem (ES) cells [10-12] or ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes [13-14] have turned out to be the most promising for replacing scar fibrosis by new contractile elements. However, the number of cells required to regenerate a post-infarcted human myocardium (i.e., several hundreds of million) is too high to be reasonably achieved by in vitro engineering of ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. For the last few years, we and others have shown that proliferative mouse ES cells engrafted in a diseased myocardium further differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes following in-vitro commitment using the cardiogenic morphogen BMP2 [10-12]. Cardiac-specified cells then complete their differentiation in response to the local cues present in the scar and do not generate any kind of tumors.",
                "Primate Embryonic stem (ES) cells feature the capability to selfrenew and to differentiate in any cell lineage of the three embryonic layers namely the ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm [35]. However, spontaneous differentiation of ES cells toward a specific cell lineage is poorly efficient, specifically for primate ES cells. Human ES cells do not share with mouse ES cells the same molecular mechanisms of self-renewal or capabilities of spontaneous differentiation [15]. For the last decade, laboratories have developed protocols to direct mouse and human ES (HES) cells toward their favourite cell type. These protocols are mandatory to: (i) better investigate and thus comprehend the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying ES cell differentiation, (ii) use ES cells-derived differentiated cells as a toxicology model (iii) perform HTS (High Throughput Screening) aiming at discovering new cardiogenic molecules, markers of cardiac genetic diseases or new therapeutic drugs [36-37] (iv) design protocols of cell therapy of heart failure [38].",
                "There is a clear need, therefore, to provide clinical grade cells which can subsequently differentiate into cardiomyocytes in situ following their transplantation in infarcted myocardium without any sign of hyperproliferation, by a method able to specifically differentiate in vitro a high number of primate ES cells or embryonic-like state cells toward a cardiovascular lineage.",
                "In this context, it would be worthwhile to have further at one's disposal a simple and reproducible protocol to commit primate ES cells or embryonic-like state cells toward a cardiovascular lineage allowing to sort out the population of early cardiovascular progenitors which retain the capability to proliferate and repopulate the postinfarction scar.",
                "This is the object of the present invention.",
                "Herein, the inventors bring the proof of concept that primate ES cells such as Human ES cells or embryonic-like state cells, can also be directed toward a cardiogenic and vascular fate using the morphogen BMP2 in association with a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and to selectively collect these cardiovascular progenitors thus obtained by using the positive CD15 (SSEA1) biomarker. Furthermore, the cells do differentiate into cardiomyocytes following engraftment into the myocardial scar without any sign of hyperproliferation. These data open the path for the use of early cardiovascular progenitors, which retain the capability to proliferate and repopulate the postinfarction scar.",
                "Thus, the present invention relates to methods for obtaining substantially pure populations of primate cardiovascular progenitors as well as compositions such as therapeutical composition, containing these cell populations and method of using these cell populations.",

A fraction of BMP2-treated cells were used prior to sorting for FACS analysis using the anti-CD15 FITC and anti-cardiac markers antibodies (FIGS. 10A and 10B). 38% of cells turned out to be CD15+. This percentage was used to normalise the percentage of cells positive for the cardiac markers (numbers in green). Cells were then plated on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in KODMEM added with KOSR (invitrogen), glutamine, non essential amino acids and mercaptoethanol (HES propagation medium) and stained one week later with anti-isl1, -NRx2.5 and -Mef2c. A similar pattern of expression of cardiac proteins (i.e., NRx2.5, Mef2c, Tbx5 and Isl1) as well as endothelial marker CD31 were found in CD15+ cells derived cells as assessed by FACS analysis (FIG. 1A) and immunofluorescence (FIG. 10B).",

                        "This study reveals that HES cells or embryonic-like state cells (iPS cells) are capable to differentiate into cardiomyocytes without formation of teratomas after commitment toward a cardiac lineage using the cardiogenic factor BMP2. While BMP2 was shown to improve late cardiac differentiation of already differentiating cells [17], our study reports the strong instructive action of the morphogen on undifferentiated HES cells.",
                        "BMP2 is a potent mesodermal and cardiogenic instructor when used at low concentration. Its cardiogenic potential is a well conserved property throughout the evolution. Dpp, the drosophila homo log of BMP2, favours formation of the mesoderm including the heart [18]. Similar effects have been observed in zebrafish [19], Xenopus [20-21] and chicken [22]. Our data obtained in two separate cell lines uncovered that BMP2 function is conserved in human species. While I6 cells were more prone to give rise to a mesodermal lineage (FIG. 5), maximal BMP2 response was not significantly different from the one observed with HUES-1 cells although maximal extent of gene expression was higher in I6 than in HUES-1 cells. Used alone, in a defined (KOSR) medium, BMP2 effect was weak while its instructive action was dramatically enhanced by addition of the FGF receptor inhibitor, SU5402. Indeed, Human ES cells are grown on feeder cells which secrete many factors including FGF2 which is known to antagonize the BMP2 signaling pathway. SU5402 could act through at least two mechanisms to unmask the BMP2 transcriptional effect. First, FGF2 phosphorylates smad2/3, thereby preventing the BMP2 signaling co-factor from translocating into the nucleus and thus to exert its transcriptional action [23]. Second, FGF2 is also known to act as a paracrine factor on both MEF and HES cells to regulate expression of Cerberus, a nodal and BMP antagonist enriched in HES cells [24]. Finally, it might be that SU5402 blocks self-renewal of cells and favours non-specific differentiation which is further directed to the mesoderm by BMP2. By blocking all or either one of these pathways, the FGF inhibitor is required to unravel the BMP2 transcriptional response of HES cells.",
                        "In keeping with previous observations made in hearts transplanted with mouse [10, 11, 25], and human [26] ES cells, no hyperproliferation (teratoma) was observed in any of the rats injected with cardiac-committed HES cells. As intramyocardial injections in a beating heart are also known to cause leakage of a substantial proportion of cells [27], it is also noteworthy that we failed to document any extra-cardiac tumor. In fact, it was known for a long time that grafts of embryonic tissue also loose the capacity to form tumors very early after differentiation [28] when they acquire control of their proliferation by extracellular signal regulated kinases. It is thus not surprising that a similar scenario takes place after cardiac commitment of HES cells. As such, our findings are not in contradiction with the previous observation [11] that injection of HES cells into a normal immunocompetent myocardium results in teratoma formation since the latter results primarily suggest that such an environment is unlikely to provide enough cardiogenic factors required for differentiation of ES cells. Of note, the rather reassuring safety data yielded by our experiments were obtained despite the lack of pretransplantation sorting targeted at eliminating non specified cells. This suggests that the environment of the diseased myocardium (i.e., scar) enriched in growth factors is sufficient to drive primed ES cells toward a cardiac fate [25]. In a clinical perspective, however, such a selection step remains a major goal.",
                        "So far, two studies have assessed the effects of intramyocardial transplantation of HES cells. Both have entailed the use of embryoid body-derived cardiomyocytes into either normal myocardium [26] or acutely infarcted myocardium [29]. To make the protocol more clinically relevant, we selected a delayed timing of in-scar transplantation that tends to mimic the clinical scenario of heart failure and injected cardiac-specified but not yet fully differentiated monolayer-cultured cardiovascular progenitors. Altogether, the engraftment patterns seen after 2 months support the advantage of this cardiac commitment process before transplantation into the target scar where local signals are then expected to drive the fate of the graft further down the cardiomyocytic differentiation pathway.",
                        "We should however point out that the phenotype of HES cell-derived cardiomyocytes in situ was rather close to a foetal one. Indeed the cells still expressed \u03b2-MHC and ANP, two known markers of early stage of cardiac differentiation. The short length of the sarcomere is still characteristic of a foetal myocyte. Several reasons could account for this immature phenotype. HES cells may require a longer time (more than two months) to fully differentiate. Alternatively, the paracrine environment of the infarction scar may not provide the factors (some FGFs, Neuregulin, retinoic acid, BMP10, . . . ) [30] or signals taking place in embryogenesis to ensure a full differentiation process.",
                        "Another interesting observation is that I6 cells gave rise to larger engraftment areas than HUES-1 cells. Although both cell lines respond with the same efficiency to BMP2, I6 cells feature a higher basal expression of mesodermal cardiac genes (FIG. 5). This indicates that the cell line is already committed to the mesoderm, which is likely to account for the better cardiogenic potential in vivo. Of note, HUES-1 cells pretreated with BMP2 together with SU5402 also featured a better engraftment than HUES-1 challenged by BMP2 alone. This further emphasizes that the stage of specification is crucial to ensure a proper differentiation of ES cells in situ. The finding that the rates of scar repopulation by the grafted cells was overall low probably reflects a combination of initially insufficient cell dosing, extracardiac cell leakage at the time of injections and possible death of retained cells. Clearly, optimisation of the functional benefits of ES cells transplantation will require that each of these issues be thoughtfully addressed.",
                        "Finally, and in contrast to what has been reported in our previous studies using mouse ES cells [10, 31], we could not detect Cx43 mRNA or protein in HES cell-derived cardiomyocytes. HES-cell derived differentiated cardiomyocytes [13] did not either express Cx43 when transplanted in injured left ventricle while they did express it when co-cultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [32]. The reason for this discrepancy with mouse ES cells or the ex-vivo situation is still unclear and might involve line-specific differences in the cardiogenic potential, a still early stage of cell development, a level of expression below the threshold of detection by immunostaining, a mistargeting of the protein or inhibitory signals coming from the fibrotic scar of infarcted rat myocardium to which HES cells might be highly sensitive. Finally, Human ESC were transplanted into rat hearts and that some of the cues required for the full differentiation of the cardiac-specified cells into Cx43-expressing cardiomyocytes may have been missing. This issue is under investigation in the laboratory.",
                        "Expression of Cx43 remains, however, critical to establish unequivocally as a true cardiac regeneration implies that the donor-derived cardiomyocytes can establish gap junction-supported electromechanical connections with those of the host. The formation of such a syncytium allowing graft-host synchronized beats which is critical for enhancement of contractility has not yet been achieved with adult cells, whether myogenic [33] or bone marrow-derived [34]. The demonstration that HES cells could fill this unmet need would likely be a major step for rationalizing their use in situations where patient outcomes are critically dependent on the replenishment of a new pool of contractile cells."
