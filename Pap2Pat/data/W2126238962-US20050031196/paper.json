    "title": "Finding optimal views for 3D face shape modeling",
    "date": "2004-06-10",
    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in multi-view 3D face modeling is the determination of the set of optimal views (poses) required for accurate 3D shape estimation of a generic face. There is no analytical solution to this problem, instead (partial) solutions require (near) exhaustive combinatorial search, hence the inherent computational difficulty of this task. We build on our previous modeling framework, which uses an efficient contour-based silhouette method and extend it by aggressive pruning of the view-sphere with view clustering and various imaging constraints. A multi-view optimization search is performed using both model-based (eigenheads) and data-driven (visual hull) methods, yielding comparable best views. These constitute the first reported set of optimal views for 3D face shape capture and provide useful empirical guidelines for the design of 3D face recognition systems.",

                "Active sensing for 3D face model acquisition still requires costly devices thus many proposed methods recover 3D face shape from 2D images or projections. Some of these are based on a direct approach which obtains 3D location of points on the face through dense 2D correspondence on the images [8,5,9]. Other methods leverage off parameterized 3D face models and search for optimal parameters which best describe the input images [3,6]. In either case, the number and viewpoint of input images is an important parameter for high quality 3D reconstruction. By intuition, the more input images taken from different viewpoints, the higher the quality of model fitting and subsequent reconstruction. However, this also requires more computation as well as increased equipment costs. With the right viewpoints it is possible to use smaller number of images and obtain better results. Furthermore, it is possible that beyond a certain number of views, additional ones do not significantly improve match quality. Although these questions are quite natural in every kind of multi-view reconstruction problem, there have been no reports in the open literature regarding the number and location (configuration) of multiple cameras for acquiring 3D face models.",
                "Different objects will have different prototype or aspect views [4]. However, we can envision a canonical set of optimal views for specific object classes with notably high intraclass similarity such as the human face. For example, dealing with illumination, Lee et al. [7] empirically determined an optimal configuration of 9 point sources of light which span the generic subspace of faces under variable illumination. In this paper we tackle a similar problem but now for pose: finding an optimal set of views that can best describe a 3D human face by way of its projections (shape silhouettes) -by analogy, \" K points-of-view.\"",
                "Since no analytical formulation is possible, we adopt an empirical approach. We discretely sample the view-sphere and generate a finite set of view configurations. Each of these is evaluated by way of its resulting ensemble error on a representative dataset of individual faces. We use real Cyberware-scanned 3D faces to simulate the multi-view imaging of live subjects. The advantages of this (simulated) approach are automated multi-view data generation (with no physical costs/limitations) and the use of high-resolution 3D faces as ground truth in subsequent evaluations.",
                "There are different reconstruction methods that could be used in this investigative framework. Our goal is to find the optimal view configurations for generic faces given that the silhouettes (projections) of an object provide the simplest and most informative clues for the shape recovery. We compare two silhouette-based methods in our (near) exhaustive optimization search. One is a model-based approach using a boundary-weighted silhouette contour technique [6]. The other is a data-driven visual hull construction method based on a volume carving algorithm [10].",
                "Due to the large number of potential views, an aggressive pruning of the view-sphere is needed. Here we make use of aspect views as proposed by Cyr & Kimia [4] for general 3D object recognition. An aspect view is the silhouette projection of the object from a viewpoint which repre- sents a range of similar nearby views in the space of uniformly sampled view-sphere. We use a similar technique to reduce the size of the view space except we only have one object class. After uniformly sampling the view-sphere and applying high-level model-specific constraints such as facial symmetry, we generate view clusters by merging nearby view cells using a 2D silhouette similarity metric and pick prototypical \"centroids\" of each cluster as our aspect views. Any combinatorial subset of these aspect views constitutes a candidate multi-view configuration."

                "In previous work [6], we introduced a model-based shape-from-silhouette method for capturing 3D face models using multiple calibrated cameras. Figure 1 shows one such 3D model obtained from a novel subject inside a special multi-view rig (dome). In this case, the \"right\" camera configuration was found after some trial and error and using our \"intuition\" as to which views are informative for shape capture. In this paper, our goal is to essentially remove the guess-work from the view selection process and determine the optimal geometry (view configuration) for a given number of cameras (here we focus on estimation of 3D shape only). Our optimization framework allows the user to easily incorporate existing physical constraints into the optimal view selection problem. In this section we briefly review our 3D modeling methodology (for further details the reader is referred to [6]).",
                "For model building we used the USF \"HumanID\" dataset [1] of 3D Cyberware scans of 97 male and 41 female adult faces of various races and ages. The number of points in each face mesh varies from approximately 50,000 to 100,000. All faces in the database were first resampled to obtain point-to-point correspondence and then aligned to a reference face to remove any pose variation and/or any misalignment (during the scan). We then perform PCA on the database of aligned 3D faces to obtain the eigenvectors of our shape model and their associated eigenvalues (the variances of their implicit Gaussian distribution). This decomposition can be used to reconstruct a new or existing face through the linear combination of \"eigenhead\" basis func-tions [2].",
                "An inspection of the PCA eigenvalue spectrum and the resulting shape reconstructions indicated that the first 60 eigenheads were quite sufficient for capturing most of the salient facial features of the subjects in our database. The corresponding \u03b1 i shape coefficients were therefore our opti- mization parameters. Specifically, let M(\u03b1) be any arbitrary face model which produces a polygon mesh given a param-",

Then, S k model (\u03b1) is a silhouette image rendered by projecting T (M(\u03b1)) onto an image plane using the pose information appeared in the k th silhouette image.",

                "where the cost function f measures the difference between two binary silhouettes. For the cost function f in Eq.( 1) the simplest difference metric between two (binary) silhouettes is the number of 'on' pixels when a pixel-wise XOR operation is applied. But in order to prioritize matching the right pixels (on the occluding contours) and to promote uniqueness so f has a global minimum, we must impose a higher penalty for any mismatch near the boundary pixels of the input silhouette.",
                "where D(S) is the Euclidean distance transform of binary image S and S is the inverse image of S. Note that d represents a distance map from the silhouette contour and can be computed once in a preprocessing step. We call this cost function boundary-weighted XOR, which provides a simple and effective alternative to precise contour matching. Consequently, there is no need for expensive correspondences with edge-linking, curve-fitting and distance computations between contours. Furthermore, the (weighted) XOR operations can be performed in hardware. Given the inherent complexity (and nonlinearity) of the cost function (and no analytic gradients) we used a probabilistic downhill simplex method to minimize Eq.(1).",
                "To illustrate our 3D shape modeling accuracy, we chose 50 real faces from the database and an additional 50 synthetic (novel) faces generated by randomly sampling the implicit Gaussian prior distribution of the PCA model. In this case, 11 virtual cameras were then positioned in the front hemisphere around the subject. The input silhouette images were acquired by rendering each of the sample faces in the image planes of the 11 virtual cameras. Figure 2 shows a visualization of the distribution of reconstruction errors obtained. The selected faces in the figure correspond to the minimum, median, and the maximum L 2 error among all 100 (real and virtual) samples. The important thing to note is that our silhouette-based technique captures the most important facial features with relatively high accuracy even in the worst-case scenario (3rd column)."

We align the facial region of the prototype head to a resampled face (by smooth deformations) and then \"stitch\" the two together to synthesize a \"virtual\" test subject complete with full head and shoulders. In this way, we can generate complete silhouette images with the same exact face shapes as those in the database yet maintain the proper geometry of actual (complete) subjects.  "

We discard all the view cells in the rear-half of the view-sphere since the face is occluded from their vantage point. We further discard the view cells which are too high/low in elevation, since these are unlikely and/or impractical physical locations for a real camera. Furthermore, from such oblique views it is hard to capture facial contour due to the occlusion (and confusion) by the subject's hair and shoulder. In our case we restrict the elevation of view cells within \u00b145 \u2022 . Finally, assuming (rough) vertical symmetry of human faces, we discard the entire left-half of the remaining view cells and are left with the 44 view cells shown in Figure 4 (right)."

For example, if we want to find 11 optimal views from those 44 views by an exhaustive search, it yields approximately 7 \u00d7 10 9 combinations to search through. Assuming each reconstruction takes 1 minute, this problem becomes quite intractable. Therefore, we need to reduce the search space further. Our observation is that the silhouette images of two neighboring view cells may be quite similar. Therefore, we measure the silhouette difference and merge the view cells within a certain distance and represent the merged view cells with one view. Note that we consider only the silhouette difference around the critical facial area since the face shape recovery is not affected by the silhouette difference of the other areas (head/shoulders).",
                        "For clustering, we first build a lookup table (D) that contains the partial or face-restricted XOR distance between every two view cells in the search space. Initially, every view cell is considered a cluster and the aspect view of the cluster is the view cell itself. We define the distance of two clusters by the distance of their aspect views and that information is pre-computed and stored in D. We find the two neighbor clusters that have the minimum distance among all the other neighbor clusters and merge them. After merging two clusters, we compute a new aspect view for the new merged cluster. The new aspect view is the view cell which has the minimum value for the maximum distance to all the other view cells in the same cluster. We repeat this process until the desired number of clusters remain. Figure 5 shows 10 clusters and their aspect views obtained using this clustering procedure. Note that the resulting aspect views are not necessarily geometric centroids of clusters, but the view cells with minimum silhouette distance to other cluster members. To circumvent any subject-dependency and generalize this clustering, all the entries in our lookup table D were created by averaging the pair-wise view cell distances for 50 different synthesized heads in our database. Table 1 gives the coordinates of the aspect views wherein azimuths of {-90 \u2022 , 0 \u2022 , +90 \u2022 } correspond to {left, front, right} directions in a head-centered reference frame.",

All L 2 reconstruction errors were confined to the critical facial area only so as to ignore extraneous input from hair/head. We discard view #1 since from its downward angle the face silhouette is completely hidden/confounded by the torso, as well as view #2 since frontal views offer very little occluding contour as constraints for shape recovery (although frontal views are preferred for capturing texture)."

Currently, we have only searched up to K = 5, although there is some experimental evidence that beyond this one may encounter diminishing returns. The default reconstruction method is our modelbased (eigenhead) 3D face shape recovery method [6]. By way of comparison, we also examined a purely data-driven method using visual hull construction. It should be noted that visual hulls by themselves are not at all capable of accurate reconstructions (even with hundreds of views). The goal here is to simply verify that a data-driven technique cially one from few images) is not a very accurate representation and we are only focusing on the optimal views selected (regardless of their high error). Unlike the modelbased results, here the reconstruction quality is much more view-dependent than subject-dependent. However the view dependency decreases significantly as the number of views (K) increases (see the error standard deviations). The graphs in Figure 8 show the errors of all view configurations at K = {2, 3, 4, 5}. In all 4 graphs, we note the presence of \"plateaus\" where the error is nearly constant for a large number of configurations. Interestingly, the first plateau corresponding to the top \"group\" is all the subsets which include the profile view #10 (one of the most salient). We can see marked similarities in the optimal views in Table 2 and Table 3. For example, both methods indicate views #3 and #10 to be the most informative. There are a few differences but these are somewhat misleading. The best view configurations in Table 2 are marked in Figure 8 with arrows. We note that our model-based optimal views have almost the same errors as the best views chosen with visual hull method and are always in the first plateau or top quartile that includes the key profile view #10."

These findings should provide useful guidelines for designing future 3D face recognition systems and are in agreement with existing practice and intuition. For example, the two most salient views (#3 and #10) correspond closely with the established (biometric) standards of \"3/4 view\" (INS photos) and profile view (\"mugshot\" photos). We have not yet searched for K > 5 mainly due to the computational costs, but it appears that reconstructions do not improve significantly beyond K = 4, 5 (see the best errors listed in Table 2). One can easily incorporate additional physical and operational constraints into our framework. For example, although a frontal view is not very salient for shape, it is the preferred view for capturing texture-maps (hence its prevalence in nearly all 2D face recognition systems) and can be simply pre-selected before the search. Finally, video-based capture -where subject motion (pose variation) provides (virtual) views -is essentially equivalent to the static multiview case, and we have previously used our modeling technique (Figure 1) with monocular sequences but only with sub-optimal poses (by guessing which K frames to use). We now plan to parse a video of a moving subject and automatically select the optimal poses for 3D modeling."

The average error means and average error standard deviations (last two columns) are based on the average reconstruction errors across all views and both tend to decrease with increasing K (as expected since more views provide more constraints).
