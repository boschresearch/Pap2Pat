                        "Multiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disease in young adult population catalogued into neurodegenerative disorders of unknown etiology. Inflammatory, infective, and autoimmune causes have been proposed to have a pathogenic role in this disease, although the link between these factors and the disease etiology remains to be elucidated.",
                        "From the genetic point of view, studies on twins and siblings suggest that susceptibility genes may play a role in this disease. Multiple sclerosis has, in fact, a clinically significant heritable component.",
                        "A genomewide association study was carried out in order to identify alleles associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis [7]. A transmission disequilibrium test of 334,923 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 931 family trios revealed 49 SNPs having an association with multiple sclerosis. Alleles of IL2RA and IL7RA and those in the HLA locus are identified as heritable risk factors for multiple sclerosis. However, the detection of susceptibility loci is an important starting point, but does not clarify what are exactly the genes involved in the transmission of the disease and through what molecular mechanisms. Moreover, a correlation between genotype variation and phenotype phenomena has not been demonstrated. For such a reason, susceptibility loci need to be finely mapped and also correlated with the function of the component genes.",
                        "Candidate-gene studies and whole genome association studies as well as copy number variations (CNVs) detection on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based arrays involving more than hundred thousand markers have been performed and identified several susceptibility loci in the human genome, being the HLA locus on 6p21.32 the more confidently associated locus [1-6]. A few other possible susceptibility loci have been described although of uncertain statistical significance [7,8].",
                        "When using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based arrays and even when controls are accurately randomised, undetectable errors may occur especially linked to the population geographical origins, to the known differences in SNPs density, depending on the various human chromosomes or even genomic regions involved. These errors may inflate the apparently significant differences between patients and controls (genomic inflation) generating false positive or false negative, and finally hampering a true recognition of the associated loci [8].",
                        "In order to overcome this \u201cpotential\u201d trouble, an enormous number of individuals have to be analysed as recommend by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and as recently reported [8], to get unbiased data and to replicate the associations in the identified loci. However, the Authors themselves conclude that functional studies are required."

                        "The present inventors to investigate the occurrence of copy number variations (CNVs) underlining genome unbalances in the major locus (HLA, chromosome 6p21) associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) recur to a comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) array in order to overcome the inevitable errors associated with the SNPs-based arrays.",
                        "It is now well recognised that copy number variations (CNVs) typically ranging from 1 kb to several Mb do contribute to genetic variations and disease susceptibility. CNVs account for more nucleotide variations between individuals; in addition, the functional meaning of CNVs might be more immediate, especially for those located within genes, regulatory regions or known imprinted regions, since the possible consequence of the genome unbalance(s) may be interpretable in a more straight forward way.",
                        "The advantage to search for CNVs by the CGH technique is the possibility to directly correlate the known, validated CNVs with a possible function, both related to the specific gene unbalanced and to other genomic regions with copy variations. In fact, CGH approach allows to finely mapping the identified CNVs in non-genic regions, possibly correlated to genes regulatory function, epigenetic changes or other non-coding functions.",
                        "The development of robust high throughput platforms based on comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) capable of identifying thousand genomic variations has greatly improved the research in this direction, as recently demonstrated in a major neurodegenerative disorder, the amiotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which non-polymorphic sub-microscopic duplications and deletions seem to be frequent in sporadic cases.",
                        "The present inventors designed a locus-specific CGH array in order to explore the occurrence of CNVs in the HLA-DRA locus region (6,899,999 bp; chromosome 6p21: 29,900,001-36,800,000 bp) in 15 patients with the peculiar association of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) and MS phenotype.",
                        "The present inventors already described the peculiar association of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in patients with MS in the international patent application No. PCT/IT2008/000129. In such an application the inventors demonstrated that CCSVI is due to stenosing venous malformations (VM) affecting the azygous and the jugular veins, leading to significant anomalies in cerebral venous outflow haemodynamics. The hampered cerebral venous return in consequence of the extracranial venous malformations is peculiar to MS, and was not found in a miscellaneous of patients affected by other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",
                        "In total patients showed 322 CNVs of which 225 extragenic and 97 intragenic. The present inventors identified 234 known polymorphic CNVs in the 15 patients having such a \u201cplus\u201d phenotype (i.e. VM-CCSVI and MS phenotype). Looking at the distribution of the polymorphic CNVs identified in these patients, the present inventors observed a peak of CNVs number within the HLA region. Outside this specific region however, the number of CNVs per patients remains high, though with variable distribution.",
                        "Interesting, the overall number of CNVs showed a correlation with the number of stenosing VM as demonstrated by venography in the extracranial segments of the cerebrospinal veins, with a trend toward significance.",
                        "The contribution to the correlation is certainly due to the extragenic CNVs, being significantly correlated to the number of stenosing VM (r=0.53, r=0.28, p<0.05).",
                        "This result suggests that the contribution of extragenic CNVs in the development of the associated VM is related to their regulatory action in the process of angiogenesis.",
                        "The region studied contains 211 known genes. Using the functional bioinformatics tool the present inventors identify many genes interacting in both neurodegenerative and angiogenesis circuits. Notably, HSPA1L, HSP1A and HSP1B and the HLADQ2 genes network on both pathways. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) represent a group of regulatory proteins involved in a variety of processes, including immunity and angiogenesis. In particular, HSPA1L expression is modulated by ETS1 transcription factor and by SP100 a nuclear autoimmune antigen. Interestingly, genes negatively regulated by ETS1 and up-regulated by SP100, as HSPA1L, have anti-migratory or anti-angiogenic properties.",
                        "MS has a very well known major heritable component since its susceptibility is associated with the MHC class II region, especially HLA-DRB5*0101-HLA-DRB1*1501-HLA-DQA1*0102-HLADQB1*0602 haplotypes, which dominate genetic contribution to MS risk [20]. Interestingly HLADQA2 is known to be involved with pro-inflammatory CD4(+) T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as MS and type 1 diabetes [21]. CD4 is also a very well known inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis [22], so supporting a link between the two pathways. The interpretation of the pathway interaction is obviously complex, but it suggests biological and functional links among these genes as well as, intriguingly, between angiogenesis and immunity.",
                        "Consistently with the general meaning of extragenic CNVs, putatively involved in gene expression regulation, this finding is interesting, since it supports the possibility that the number of structural variations laying within regulatory regions may represent a genomic \u201cperturbation\u201d increasing susceptibility for VM phenotype associated with MS the present inventors described.",
                        "Regarding specific candidate genes which expression could be potentially disturbed by genomic unbalances or \u201cperturbation\u201d, the pathways analysis suggests that genes involved in angiogenesis and immunity are the more interesting proteins."
