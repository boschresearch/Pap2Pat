    "abstract": "Readily available hydrophilic and small organofluorine moieties were condensed via \u201cclick chemistry\u201d to generate nonionic hydrophilic fluorinated molecules with unique 19F MR signatures. These were used to fabricate stable liposome formulations for imaging various tissue types. This approach was tailored to exploit the broad spectrum of organic 19F molecular species and to generate probes with distinct 19F MRI signatures for simultaneous assessment of multiple molecular targets within the same target volume.",

                        "The invention generally relates to the fields of radiology and organic chemistry. In particular, the invention concerns hydrophilic, non-toxic Fluorine-19 (19F) contrast agents for 19F MRI.",
                        "B. Description of Related Art",
                        "Recent technological advances in molecular pathology have revolutionized the understanding of several diseases at the cellular and molecular levels. This knowledge enables improved diagnoses, allows treatment plans to be directed to specific targets, and translates to better treatment outcomes [1-3]. Equivalent technologies for noninvasive in vivo evaluation of disease activity and therapeutic efficacy will enable the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. To this end, molecular imaging techniques including positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), optical imaging with flourescent probes and several magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) platforms are in development to assess molecular targets and metabolic processes in vivo [4].",
                        "Today, nuclear molecular imaging methods (PET and SPECT) dominate clinical settings, but result in significant radiation exposure. A single PET scan may results in up to 7 millisieverts (mSv) of radiation exposure [5], which is equivalent to about 70 chest x-rays. Repeated exposure of patients to positron emission reagents is therefore not recommended. Optical molecular imaging techniques are limited by imaging depth. These techniques find use in small animal studies, and are less useful in larger animals. A versatile, non-radioactive molecular imaging probe with no tissue depth limitations is therefore highly desirable.",
                        "When administered in vivo, the ideal molecular imaging probe should detect, localize and report on a process/activity within a cell or tissue, with high sensitivity and specificity. The biocompatibility of liposomes, their ability to carry diverse payloads, and the ease with which they can be ligand-targeted to specific molecular targets, make them an excellent nanoparticle platform for molecular imaging [6,7]. In addition, sensitivity can easily be maximized by optimizing the payload capacity per particle.",
                        "19F MRI is emerging as a molecular imaging modality with broad applications in biomedicine for several reasons. Fluorine's gyromagnetic ratio is very close to that of the proton (1H), so current 1H MRI hardware requires minimal changes to acquire 19F-based images. Further, there is no MRI-detectable endogenous 19F, leading to images with very high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). There is a linear relationship between contrast agent concentration and signal intensity, which allows direct and unambiguous quantification of disease activity [8,9]. Most importantly, organofluorine molecules have a broad chemical shift range of >350 ppm. Current receiver bandwidth suggests a peak separation of \u02dc12 ppm to individually image multiple 19F species without introducing chemical shift artifacts. This allows the concurrent use of as many as 30 19F probes with unique MRI signatures.",
                        "19F MRI is limited by sensitivity, and a large number of 19F atoms must be present in each voxel of target volume to enable high conspicuity. A number of nanoparticle formulations have been suggested to address this limitation. These include perfluorocarbons (PFCs), perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs), dendrimers, fluorinated amphiphiles and other hyperfluorinated molecules such as PERFECTA [10]. To date, PFCs and PFPEs dominate the preclinical/clinical space, but they have several drawbacks, including low aqueous solubility (limiting formulation to water emulsions requiring surfactants), limited shelf stability [11], and magnetically diverse fluorine atoms (resulting in chemical shift artifacts and diffuse images) [12]."

Chiral molecules contain a chiral center, also referred to as a stereocenter or stereogenic center, which is any point, though not necessarily an atom, in a molecule bearing groups such that an interchanging of any two groups leads to a stereoisomer. In organic compounds, the chiral center is typically a carbon, phosphorus or sulfur atom, though it is also possible for other atoms to be stereocenters in organic and inorganic compounds. A molecule can have multiple stereocenters, giving it many stereoisomers. In compounds whose stereoisomerism is due to tetrahedral stereogenic centers (e.g., tetrahedral carbon), the total number of hypothetically possible stereoisomers will not exceed 2n, where n is the number of tetrahedral stereocenters. Molecules with symmetry frequently have fewer than the maximum possible number of stereoisomers. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Alternatively, a mixture of enantiomers can be enantiomerically enriched so that one enantiomer is present in an amount greater than 50%. Typically, enantiomers and/or diasteromers can be resolved or separated using techniques known in the art. It is contemplated that that for any stereocenter or axis of chirality for which stereochemistry has not been defined, that stereocenter or axis of chirality can be present in its R form, S form, or as a mixture of the R and S forms, including racemic and non-racemic mixtures.

For administration to a mammal, the diagnostic compositions may be combined with one or more excipients appropriate to the indicated route of administration. The diagnostic compositions may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Alternatively, the diagnostic compositions may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various buffers.

For example, a diagnosit compound may be administered to a patient in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes.",

In all cases, the composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (such as, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.",

Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the diagnostic composition into a sterile carrier which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient (i.e., the therapeutic compound) plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.",

Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of diagnostic composition calculated to produce the desired diagnostic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the diagnostic composition and the particular diagnostic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such a diagnostic compound for imaging in a patient.

Furthermore, molecular imaging-based dose painting studies using PET tracers have demonstrated the value of molecular painting in treatment, planning, and disease evaluation [17,18]. There is therefore a growing need to develop non-invasive molecular imaging probes with the ability to simultaneously profile multiple molecular species/disease activity and disease subtypes within a target volume by molecular painting. 19F MRI probes have the potential to be molecular paints, but the field is currently dominated by PFCs and PFPEs which lack flexibility in formulation and do not allow individual imaging of diverse probes.",
                        "Several alternative 19F contrast formulation strategies addressing some of these limitations are under investigation and well documented in a recent review [10]. However, achieving a safely injectable formulation with any of these strategies remains a tall order. Partlow et al. have previously reported the ability to simultaneously track multiple targets in vivo using unique 19F MR signatures of PFC nanobeacons[19], the formulation of which have similar limitations as the PFC and PFPEs.",
                        "The molecules and methods disclosed herein are the first examples of a facile, versatile and highly reproducible approach to molecular painting by 19F MRI. Previous attempts at liposome formulations have focused on the use of perfluoro fatty acids or sulfonate amphiphiles to incorporate fluorine in the bilayer of the particle [20,21], or the use of inorganic fluoride [22]. These approaches suffer from limited payload capacity and toxicity.",

When combined with the versatile liposome nanoparticle platform, they access the broad chemical shift spectrum of organofluorine species, enabling numerous targeted probes with unique 19F MR signatures. Such probes have the potential to enable noninvasive simultaneous visualization of multiple hot spots within the same region of interest (ROI), by 19F MRI as demonstrated in both phantom and in vivo assessment of the three formulations.",
                        "Isoflurane, the commonly used inhalable anesthesia in small animal studies, is fluorinated and highly lipophilic. It is therefore readily absorbed by adipose tissue in vivo. Its 19F MR signature is comparable to that of most PFCs and PFPEs. As shown in FIG. 7, this can greatly interfere with any signal from a PFC or PFPE probe, complicating data interpretation. Non-fluorinated injectable anesthesias such as ketamine and zylazine must therefore be used when running in vivo 19F MRI animal experiments with such probes. This is generally time consuming and in most cases greatly hinders work-flow. The approach disclosed herein allows for facile access to probes that can be imaged without interference from the isoflurane signal.",

Dimers and oligomers of these molecules can be readily accessed to increase the 19F content/particle of each formulation. In the dilution studies, a clear signal was observed after an 8-fold dilution. This corresponds to about 250 \u03bcL injected into the circulation of a 25 g mouse (blood volume \u02dc2 ml), about 2\u00d7 lower than the maximum allowed volume, suggesting that the SNR should be sufficient for vascular imaging with each of these formulations."

Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) from an internal standard acetone (2.05 ppm), chloroform (7.26 ppm), or water (4.79 ppm) for 1H NMR; and from an internal standard of either residual acetone (206.26 ppm), chloroform (77.00 ppm), or dimethyl sulfoxide (39.52 ppm) for 13C NMR. NMR peak multiplicities are denoted as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), p (pentet), bs (broad singlet), dd (doublet of doublet), tt (triplet of triplet), ddd (doublet of doublet of doublet), and m (multiplet). Coupling constants (J) are given in hertz (Hz). High resolution mass (HRMS) spectra were obtained from the Mass Spectrometry Unit of the Bioscience Research Collaborative at Rice University, Houston, Tex. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel 60 F254 plates from EMD Chemical Inc. and components were visualized by ultraviolet light (254 nm) and/or phosphomolybdic acid, 20 wt % solution in ethanol. SiliFlash silica gel (230-400 mesh) was used for all column chromatography."

                                "A lipid mixture consisting of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy (polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-mPEG-2000) in a molar ratio of 55:40:5 was used to make liposomes. The lipid mixture, weighed to result in a final lipid concentration of 150 mM was dissolved in 100% ethanol, at a volume of 10% of desired final volume. The solution was then warmed in a water bath, maintained at 60-64\u00b0 C., to obtain a clear solution. After the lipids had completely dissolved, a pre warmed solution of the desired compound dissolved in histidine/saline buffer (10 mM with no pH adjustment) was added: for ET0863 and ET0876, the concentration of the compound was 1.0 M while for ET0886 and ET0890 the concentrations were 0.8 and 0.5 M respectively. The resulting mixture was incubated at 60-64\u00b0 C. for 45 min and the spontaneously formed multilamellar liposomes extruded on a Lipex thermoline extruder (Northern Lipids Inc., Canada), beginning with five passes through a 400 nm Nuclepore membrane (Waterman, Newton, Mass.) followed by eight passes through a 100 nm membrane. The resulting preparation was subjected to diafiltration through a 500 kD membrane (Spectrum Labs, Rancho Dominguez, Calif.) for 10 volume exchanges to practically eliminate any unencapsulated compound. Mean particle size was determined by Dynamic Light Scattering on a BI-90 goniometer/autocorrelator system at 90\u00b0 using a 532 nm solid state laser source (Brookhaven Instruments Corp, Holtville, N.Y.), and the final 19F content determined by comparing 19F NMR integrals against a standard solution prepared from analytical grade trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma Aldrich), as previously described [13].",

Mice were anethetized by exposure to Isoflurane prior to injection of probes and maintained under anethesia for the duration of the experiment, as well as a temperature of 37\u00b0 C. using a temperature controlled air-flow system.

Precursors of both the fluorinated and hydrophilic moieties were introduced in this step as either the azido or alkynyl derivative based on the ease and efficiency of preparation from commercially available starting materials as shown in FIGS. 6A-6B. Coupling of the respective hydrophilic and fluorinated moieties followed by deprotection to obtain the final compounds (FIG. 2B) all proceeded with excellent yields, and were optimized to generate gram quantities of each compound. All intermediates and final compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, HRMS, and 19F NMR (where applicable).",
                                "As shown in FIG. 1 (a) all final products were obtained as solids at room temperature and readily dissolved in aqueous media (water, saline, PBS, and histidine/saline buffers), to give clear solutions, with some at \u22651 M concentrations (b). 19F NMR of the solutions each gave a single peak: \u221275.90, \u2212121.57, \u2212143.39 and \u221262.65 ppm for ET0863, ET0876, ET0886, and ET0890, respectively (c). The single peaks indicate both the magnetic and chemical purity of each compound (estimated overall chemical purity >95%). 19F MR images of phantoms of these solutions showed no chemical shift artifacts, as expected (d).",
                                "The liposome nanoparticle platform for formulation was chosen primarily because of its versatility as a nano vector and its long history of in vivo use. Additionally, liposome surfaces can easily be modified with a variety of ligands and targeting moieties including small molecules and antibodies to bind specific in vivo molecular targets with high efficiency [9]. Formulation of all four compounds using standard protocols as described in the methods section proceeded smoothly. Particle size measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), showed a mean diameter of 164.76\u00b11.16 nm and a polydispersity of 0.10\u00b10.04. The final 19F concentrations of ET0876, ET0886, and ET0890 were 22.7\u00b11.4, 21.9\u00b10.3, and 16.6\u00b11.7 mg/mL respectively, reflective of the concentration of individual compounds in the hydration buffer. Preliminary stability testing in plasma at 37\u00b0 C. showed that ET0863 particles leaked more than 5% of their content within a 1.5 hour test period. ET0876, ET0886, and ET0890 particles all showed less than 5% leak, and were retained for use in subsequent experiments.",

Dilution studies (c) showed that each of them was detectable at an 8 fold dilution, and a plot of the SNR against concentration (d) shows a linear relationship between concentration and signal intensity.",
                                "To evaluate the potential of these compounds for molecular painting, phantoms of all three formulations were scanned together with a phantom containing Isoflurane (the widely used inhalable fluorinated anesthetic in small animal studies). FIG. 2 shows a single pulse 19F MR frequency sweep (a), showed peaks corresponding to all the fluorine species in all the phantoms: ET0890 (one peak), Isoflurane (two peaks), ET0876 (one peak), and ET0886 (one peak). An image from a 1H MRI scan (b), showed the location of each phantom within the field of view in the coil: ET0890 (position 1), Isoflurane (position 2), ET0876 (position 3), and ET0886 (position 4). When the phantoms were subjected to the same 19F MSME scan sequence as above, with the highlighted peak position set as the base frequency (c), only the phantom containing that species generated a 19F MR image (shown in pseudo-color, (d)). An overlay of the 19F image over the 1H T2 image, allowed visualization of the exact location of that signal in the entire field of view (e).",
                                "Preliminary evaluation of the reproducibility of the in vitro results in an in vivo environment was performed. 50 \u03bcL of each formulation were injected as follows: intramuscularly (ET0876 in right thigh and ET0890 in the left thigh), and subcutaneously (ET0886 in the abdominal area), in C57BL6 mice (n=4). As shown in FIG. 4 each animal was anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in the magnet, and imaged using the same scan protocol as the phantoms. First, a TurboRARE T2 1H scan, with the lower torso of the animal in the field of view to show the general anatomy (the numbers 1, 3 and 4 indicate the locations in which the probes were administered, (a)), was performed. When the animal was imaged using the 19F MSME sequence with the base frequency set to the resonance frequency of highlighted peak on the Single pulse 19F spectrum (b), only a single 19F signal, corresponding to that peak was generated on the 19F MR image (c). Overlay of the 19F image over the anatomy image showed the exact location of each 19F spot (d), confirming the ability of the 19F contrast agents to be used to visualize different targets in parallel. The more diffuse signal in the abdominal area was attributed to faster diffusion of the nanoparticles within the subcutaneous space compared to within the muscle.",
                                "To demonstrate the significance of the non-interference of the isoflurane signal with the signal from these probes, mice anesthetized with isoflurane were imaged with a scan sequence optimized for studies with one of the most popular PFPEs currently in use. As shown in FIG. 5, the anesthesia generates a very strong in vivo 19F MRI signal attributed to the high lipophilicity of the gas.",
