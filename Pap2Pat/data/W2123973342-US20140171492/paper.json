    "abstract": "DNA methylation was first described almost a century ago; however, the rules governing its establishment and maintenance remain elusive. Here we present data demonstrating that active transcription regulates levels of genomic methylation. We identify a novel RNA arising from the CEBPA gene locus that is critical in regulating the local DNA methylation profile. This RNA binds to DNMT1 and prevents CEBPA gene locus methylation. Deep sequencing of transcripts associated with DNMT1 combined with genome-scale methylation and expression profiling extend the generality of this finding to numerous gene loci. Collectively, these results delineate the nature of DNMT1\u2013RNA interactions and suggest strategies for gene-selective demethylation of therapeutic targets in human diseases. RNAs are shown to interact with DNA methyltransferase 1 and prevent DNA methylation of genes at their specific locus, providing evidence that active transcription directly regulates DNA methylation levels. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification associated with silencing of gene expression. Here, Daniel Tenen and colleagues propose that active transcription directly regulates levels of DNA methylation. A non-coding RNA arising from the well-studied methylation-sensitive gene CEBPA interacts with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to prevent methylation at the CEBPA locus, thereby facilitating CEBPA expression. Functional associations between DNMT1 and RNAs seem to occur at numerous gene loci. These findings support the hypothesis that non-coding RNA participates in the regulation of genomic methylation patterns by interacting with DNMT1 and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for site-specific alteration of aberrant DNA methylation.",

                "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic signature implicated in transcriptional regulation, genomic imprinting, and silencing of repetitive DNA elements [1][2] and it occurs predominantly within CpG dinucleotides. CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in the mammalian genome (~1%) and tend to cluster within CpG islands located in the vicinity of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the majority (~70%) of human protein-coding genes 3 . While the bulk of genome is methylated at 70-80% of its CpGs, CpG islands are mostly unmethylated in somatic cells [3][4] . This modification is mediated by the members of the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) family conventionally classified as de novo (DNMT3a-b) and maintenance (DNMT1). In terms of epigenetic inheritance, DNMT1 has the unique ability to identify the hemimethylated portion of newly replicated DNA. This feature may explain how DNMT1-mediated methylation could be an epigenetic mechanism maintaining the status quo. However, it certainly does not explain how DNA methylation is altered, particularly in disease states.",
                "To examine how transcription may regulate the levels of genomic methylation, we investigated methylation dynamics of the well-studied methylation-sensitive gene CEBPA [5][6][7] , including the potential involvement of noncoding (nc) RNAs originating within CEBPA locus. Recent discoveries of functional ncRNAs have provided new regulatory clues to the control of epigenetic marks. Particularly, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression by interacting with chromatin modifiers, modulating transcription factor activity and competing for miRNA binding [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] . One unexplored aspect of regulation of gene locus DNA methylation was the possible involvement of transcripts encoded within the region.",
                "We identified a functional RNA arising from the CEBPA locus (ecCEBPA) that regulates CEBPA methylation. This RNA interacts with DNMT1, resulting in prevention of CEBPA gene methylation and robust CEBPA mRNA production. We show that such functional DNMT1-RNA association occurs in numerous gene loci. We thus propose a novel regulatory mechanism of gene methylation governed by RNAs."

We searched and identified transcripts upstream and downstream of the intronless CEBPA gene. Strand specific RT-PCR (data not shown) and Northern blot analysis of RNAs from four leukemic cell lines, probing the region immediately after the CEBPA polyadenylation site, revealed the presence of a major band of ~4.5 kb in HL-60 and U937 (where CEPBA is expressed), but not in K562 or Jurkat cell lines (where CEBPA is expressed at low or undetectable levels) (Fig. 1a,b). The identified transcript is distinct from the ~2.6 kb signal, detected with a CEBPA coding region probe, and correlates with CEBPA mRNA expression. Unlike polyadenylated CEBPA mRNA (Fig. 1c), this non-polyadenylated transcript is enriched in the nuclear fraction (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) suggesting functional roles independent of protein coding potential.",
                                "We termed this nuclear non-polyadenylated CEBPA ncRNA \"extra-coding (ec) CEBPA\", since it does encompass the entire mRNA sequence in the same-sense orientation (shown by primer extension and 5\u20323\u2032RACE; Supplementary Information (SI); Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed concordant expression between extra-coding and coding transcripts, in both cellular and nuclear RNAs (Fig. 1d,e). Similar correlation was observed in all tested human tissues (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Importantly, ecCEBPA synthesis precedes the expression of its overlapping mRNA in the S phase (SI and Supplementary Fig. 1f,g) and is regulated by both RNA polymerase II and III (RNAP II and III; SI and Supplementary Fig. h-p) as described for other loci [20][21][22] ."

                                "To examine the functional role of ecCEBPA in regulation of CEBPA transcription, we performed both loss and gain-of-function experiments. Knock-down of ecCEBPA in U937 cell line (up to a 4-fold decrease) achieved by small hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting ecCEBPA (but not CEBPA mRNA) led to a decrease of CEBPA mRNA expression of similar magnitude (Fig. 2a,b), suggesting that ecCEBPA may regulate CEBPA expression. Silencing of the CEBPA gene can be associated with DNA methylation of the promoter [6][7]23 . To examine if there was a connection between ecCEBPA and methylation of the CEBPA locus, we analyzed methylation within the distal promoter (located at -0.8-0.6 kb from the CEBPA TSS; Fig. 2a). Intriguingly, ecCEBPA knockdown led to a significant increase in DNA methylation compared to the non-targeting control (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 2a).",
                                "To investigate whether enforced expression of the ecCEBPA was sufficient to inhibit DNA methylation, the downstream region of the ecCEBPA (R1; Fig. 2a) was overexpressed in K562 cells expressing ecCEBPA and CEBPA mRNA at low to undetectable levels (Fig. 1b,d). Overexpression of only part of the ecCEBPA was dictated by the necessity to distinguish the methylation pattern of the endogenous CEBPA locus from that of the ectopically expressed construct.",
                                "Ectopic expression of the ecCEBPA (R1) resulted in greater than 3-fold increase in mRNA expression (Fig. 2d) whereas overexpression of an unrelated region (UR; located 45 kb downstream) and regions immediately outside the ecCEBPA boundaries did not affect mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 2b-d). Moreover, concomitant decrease of DNA methylation in three tested regions within the CEBPA gene, distal promoter, coding region, and 3\u2032UTR, accompanied overexpression of ecCEBPA but not of the UR (Fig. 2e; Supplementary Fig. 2e,f). Interestingly, comparative analysis of DNA methylation changes imposed by ecCEBPA overexpression versus the hypomethylating agent 5\u2032-Azacytidine (5-Aza-CR), together with genome-scale analysis (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, RRBS 24 ) of DNA methylation changes imposed by ecCEBPA versus UR overexpression, revealed that ecCEBPA-mediated demethylation was relatively selective to the CEBPA locus (Supplementary Fig. 2g-l). Indeed, increased mRNA expression and changes in methylation status within the loci of the neighboring CEBPG and distant TP73 (on chr1p36) genes were achieved after 5-Aza-CR treatment but not after ecCEBPA overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 2g-k). Furthermore, RRBS analysis of promoter and 1 st exon regions revealed that only ~3.3% of the interrogated loci (396 out of 11844) were hypomethylated at levels similar to the CEBPA locus (Supplementary Fig. 2l). Furthermore, ecCEBPA downregulation by the universal RNAPs inhibitor Actynomicin D and RNAPIII-specific inhibitor ML-60218 (Supplementary Fig. 2m) led to a corresponding increase in methylation of the CEBPA locus, in synchronized and unsynchronized U937cells (Fig. 2f, g; Supplementary Fig. 2n). Despite comparable decreases in ecCEBPA levels in both synchronized and unsynchronized cells (Fig. 2f), DNA methylation increase was more prominent in synchronized cells (Fig. 2g), suggesting a cell cycle-specific action of the ecCEBPA. Similar effect was observed in ML-60218-treated HL-60 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1i; Supplementary Fig. 2o). Consistently, we observed an inverse correlation between the CEBPA gene locus methylation and the levels of ecCEBPA in HL-60, U937 and K562 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2p).",

Among DNMTs, DNMT1 is the one whose expression and enzymatic activity peaks during S phase 25 . Increased ecCEBPA expression occurs during the S phase (Supplementary Fig. 1g), whereas inhibition of ecCEBPA during S phase results in a substantial increase of CEBPA locus DNA methylation (Fig. 2f,g, Supplementary Fig. 2n). We therefore asked whether the presence of ecCEBPA during S phase led to RNA interference of DNMT1 activity.",
                                "To determine if DNMT1 physically associates with ecCEBPA we performed RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) with specific anti-DNMT1 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 3a). We observed ecCEBPA enrichment in DNMT1-RNA precipitates, demonstrating a physical interaction between ecCEBPA and DNMT1 (Fig. 3a,b; Supplementary Fig. 3a). Analysis of polyA(+)/(-) fractions in DNMT1-RNA precipitates revealed enrichment of CEBPA transcripts in the polyA(-) fraction (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c), suggesting that the major component of CEBPA transcripts in DNMT1-RNA precipitates was ecCEBPA.",
                                "To investigate the molecular properties of RNA-DNMT1 interaction in vitro, we performed RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assays (REMSA). RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 parts of the ecCEBPA were selected by: (i) ability (R2, R5 and R6) and inability (R4) to fold into stem-loop structures 26 ; (ii) presence (R2, R5 and R6) or absence (R4) of CpG dinucleotides (Fig. 3a). RNA-DNMT1 complex formation was observed with all RNA oligonucleotides able to fold into stem-loop structures (Fig. 3c-e). Unlike DNA 27 , CpG UpG substitutions, neutral with regard of secondary structures, did not affect binding (mutR2; Fig. 3c). In contrast, mutations abrogating RNA folding ability affected RNA-DNMT1 binding (mut R5; Fig. 3e). Analyses extended to a number of RNA oligonucleotides not related to the ecCEBPA (single stranded [ss] R1 and R3; and double stranded [ds] R13; Supplementary Fig. 3d), confirmed DNMT1 binding to stem-loop structured RNAs (SI and Supplementary Fig. 3e-f). Importantly, REMSA performed in presence of increasing concentrations of spermine, a molecule with four positive charges at high density, excluded a case of charge-charge interactions (Supplementary Fig. 3g), supporting a strong element of structural recognition between DNMT1 and RNA To determine the relative affinity of DNMT1 for ecCEBPA versus DNA, ssRNA oligonucleotides capable of forming secondary structures (R5) and corresponding unmethylated (umDNA; D5/D6), hemimethylated (hmDNA; D5/D6), and fully methylated (mDNA; D5/D6) dsDNA (Fig. 3a), at a constant molar concentration, were titrated with increasing range of DNMT1 enzyme concentrations using EMSA. RNA formed complexes beginning at <0.013 \u03bcM DNMT1, whereas DNA at >0.026 \u03bcM DNMT1 (Fig. 3f), with a mean dissociation constant (Kd) for RNA of 0.045\u03bcM and between 0.082 and 0.14\u03bcM for DNA, indicating that RNA has a stronger affinity for the enzyme than DNA (Fig. 3f). Consistently, RNA unable to fold into stem-loop structures (R4; Fig. 3g) did not display the same affinity for DNMT1 as \"folded\" RNA (R5; Fig. 3f,g), demonstrating that RNA secondary structure represents an essential feature of RNA-DNMT1 complex formation.",
                                "Finally, to assess DNMT1 domain required for the RNA binding, DNMT1-GST-purified domains (Fig. 3h) were incubated with RNA oligonucleotides able or unable to fold into stem-loop structures, R5 and R4, respectively (Fig. 3e,g). The catalytic domain, including the Target Recognition Domain (TRD) 28 , shared by both fragments F4 and F5, selectively bound the \"folded\" RNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 3h). Next, we deleted the DNMT1 region including the sequence overlapping F4 and F5. Unfortunately, even minimal removal of the TRD led to disruption of DNMT1 enzymatic activity (data not shown) making further refinement of the binding domain not feasible.",
                                "Collectively, these data indicate that RNA can associate with DNMT1. This interaction is not contingent upon the presence of CpG dinucleotides, is not a trivial ion pairing, and is dependent upon certain RNA secondary structures features. Importantly, DNMT1, via its catalytic domain, binds with higher affinity to folded RNA than to DNA."

A hmDNA segment (bottom strand methylated) was engineered downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Supplementary Fig. 4a-h), and DNMT1 methylase activity was monitored in presence and absence of transcription (Fig. 4a-d). In the absence of polymerase, there was, as expected, increased DNA methylation of the upper strand (Fig. 4d-f; Supplementary Fig. 4i-j). In contrast, no changes in DNA methylation were observed in the presence of both polymerases and DNMT1 (Fig. 4c-f and Supplementary Fig. 4i-j). Standard in vitro DNA methylation assays confirmed the enzymatic impairment of DNMT1 mediated by ribooligonucleotides (Fig. 4g). Similarly, T7 RNA polymerase 29 -induced transcription in living cells led to a pronounced decrease in DNA methylation (SI and Supplementary Fig. 4k-p). Thus, RNA can complex with and impact DNMT enzymatic activity in vitro [30][31][32] and in living cells. These findings suggest that RNAs arising from methylation-sensitive genes and their promoters can regulate expression of the corresponding genes by interfering with DNA methylation."

Using 76-base paired-end sequencing, we produced a total of 30.25 and 26.95 million pair reads for DNMT1 and control libraries, respectively (detailed analysis described in Methods). All significant DNMT1 peaks (a total of 16,186; P<0.0001; false discovery rate of 7.5%) were annotated with CEAS 33 build on RefSeq hg19 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). All DNMT1 peaks were also annotated using the known RNAs databases provided by HOMER 34 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). We focused on genomic regions encompassing the 3 kb upstream to the TSS and downstream to the transcription ending site (TES) of the annotated genes, referred to as \"gene loci\". We identified 6,042 gene loci containing one or more peaks from the DNMT1 library (Methods: Data integration).",

Thus, a vast majority of DNMT1-interacting-RNAs (DiRs) were not polyadenylated.",

A merged assembly of the two RNA libraries validated a total of 15,238 (94.20%) DNMT1 RIP-Seq peaks (Fig. 5a). These findings confirmed the existence of DiRs on a genome-wide level. Next, we assessed the linkage between genomic loci giving rise to DiRs, levels of genomic methylation by RRBS 24 and expression of the corresponding nearby genes by microarray analysis, performed on HL-60 cells. Within all 15,806 RRBS-covered loci, 10,973 loci were not covered by DNMT1 specific peaks (DNMT1-unbound group) and 4,833 loci were covered by DNMT1 specific peaks (DNMT1-bound group).

We defined genes as: \"expressed\" or \"low or not expressed\" if the log 2 score was above or below 4, respectively; and \"hypomethylated\" or \"methylated\" if the mean of all CpG scores was below or above 50%, respectively (Methods: RRBS-Data integration). This approach allowed us to identify four clusters within DNMT1-unbound, DNMT1bound, and all RRBS-covered groups (Fig. 5b). Hypomethylated and expressed genes appeared to be predominant in the DNMT1-bound group (cluster C), accounting for 56.64%; whereas hypermethylated and low or unexpressed genes represented the 51.45% in the DNMT1-unbound group (cluster B). Moreover, the numbers of genes in clusters B (5646 genes) and C (2737) were significantly higher than numbers of genes in clusters A, F, E (2528, 1653, 1146) and G, H, D (584, 930, 582), respectively (P-value <0.0001). Examples of genes from clusters B and C are presented in Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 5f-h). Further, genes from cluster C belonged to a multiplicity of biological processes, indicating the diversity of DiRs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Interestingly, ~60% of these biological process gene ontology (BP-GO) terms (pvalue <= 0.01) were shared with pyknons-related BP-GO 37 . This overlap is 71 fold higher than expected. Moreover, among all DNMT1 RIPseq peaks, 46% carry at least one pyknon (Supplementary Fig. 6b) suggesting a potential relation between DiRs and pyknons. A,F,E,G,H, and D could result from technical limitations of RRBS, contingent upon the genomic location of the restriction sites and the DNA library size-selection 38 , or these genes may be governed by yet another mechanism of transcriptional control."

In every instance studied, DNA methylation levels are inversely correlated with ecCEBPA levels, and the extent of DNA methylation is determined by the absence or presence of ecCEBPA (Fig. 2).",

Indeed, the loss of CEBPA locus methylation following overexpression of the ecCEBPA does not support a model of trivial titration ('squelching' 39 ) of DNMT1 but suggests a cis regulatory role of the DiR. We propose a model wherein RNAs contain a locus-selective triplex/quadruplex 40 forming part, the 'anchor', mooring the DNMT1-RNA complex to the locus, and a DNMT1-interacting part, the 'bait', stem looplike forming sequence serving to lure the DNMT1 into association. DNMT1 sequestration by RNA does resemble a competing mechanism described for other regulatory RNAs, e.g., competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) [15][16]41 . However, unlike ceRNAs, the ecCEBPA model also introduces the requirements for both functional and physical cocompartmentalization of the RNA, its parental locus, and DNMT1. Given the DiR's ability to bind DNMT1, it is tempting to hypothesize that DiRs represent a novel class of RNA regulons 42 .",
                        "Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that RNA participates in the establishment of genomic methylation patterns by interacting with DNMT1 and pave the way for the sitespecific adjustments of aberrant DNA methylation."

Day I: Cross-linked nuclei were collected as following: 60\u00d710 6 HL-60 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (formaldehyde solution, freshly made: 50 mM HEPES-KOH; 100 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM EGTA; 11% formaldehyde) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Crosslinking was stopped by adding 1/10 th volume of 2.66 M Glycine, kept for 5 minutes at room temperature and 10 minutes on ice. Cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (freshly supplemented with 1 mM PMSF). Cell pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (volume = 4 mL): 1x Buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl; 0.5% NP-40, freshly supplemented with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitors cocktail: Roche Applied Science, Cat.

Reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h and then passed through G-25 spin columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions to remove unincorporated radioactivity. Labeled samples were gel-purified on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Binding reactions were carried out in 10 \u03bcL volumes in the following buffer: 5 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 3% v/v glycerol, 100 mM NaCl. Various amounts (0.021-0.156 \u03bcM) of purified DNMT1 protein (BPS Bioscience Inc.) were incubated with 1.1 nM of 32 P-labeled dsDNA and ss/ds RNAs. In the competitive assay, a fixed amount of protein and increasing amounts of competitors (dsDNA or poly [dI-dC]) were used. All reactions were assembled on ice and incubated at room temperature. Samples were separated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels (0.5xTBE; 4 \u00b0C; ~3h at 140 V). Gels were dried and exposed to X-ray film and/or PhosphoroImager screens. Quantitation was done with ImageQuant software. For affinity assays, the percent shifted species was determined as follows: the migration of the labeled DNA in this reaction was defined as zero percent shifted and the ratio of the PhosphoroImager counts in the area of the lane above this band to the total counts in the lane was defined as background and subtracted from all other lanes. This band represented total input. Subsequent lanes containing DNMT1-nucleic acid complexes were treated identically, and the percentage complex formation was calculated as follows: [% bound complex = (1 -((unboundbackground)/(Input -background))]. All experiments contained a control reaction lacking DNMT1. The percentage complex formation was plotted as a function of DNMT1 concentration using non-linear regression analysis performed with Prism 4.0a software. RNA and DNA oligonucleotides used in EMSA are shown in Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure 3d and listed in Supplementary Data 1."

Double stranded cDNA was synthesized using the Just cDNA Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Illumina sequencing libraries were constructed from these cDNA using a ChIP-Seq sample preparation kit (cat# IP-102-1001, Illumina, San Diego, CA) with minor modifications. Illumina paired-end adaptor and PCR primers were used to replace the single read adaptor and primers in the kit. Constructed libraries were subjected to a final size-selection step on 10% Novex TBE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad). DNA fragments of 175 -200 bp were excised from a SYBR-green-stained gel. DNA was recovered from the gel and quantified following Illumina's qPCR quantification protocol. Paired end sequencing of these libraries was then performed on an Illumina GA IIx to achieve 2\u00d776 bp reads. Paired-End reads were trimmed to 50 bp and aligned to the reference genome hg19 using BWA 62 with the following parameters: bwa aln -o 1 -l 25 -k 2; bwa sampe -o 200. To estimate a normalization factor (alpha) between the immunoprecipitations, the genome was divided into course bins (10 Kb) and reads were counted for DNMT1 RIP and IgG control in each bin. A linear regression was fitted across all non-zero bins and the slope of the regression was used as a scaling factor (alpha) to normalize the RIP and control libraries. To identify distinct regions specifically bound by DNMT1, all downstream analyses were conducted on a set of regions derived by aggregating overlapping DNMT1 RIP reads into contiguous intervals. Each DNMT1 interval was tested for significance by comparing the number of reads within the interval the number of reads in the same region of the IgG control, multiplied by the previously estimated scaling factor, alpha (exact binomial test, P=0.5). Multiple tests were corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg. 16,186 intervals (representing the start and end boundaries of contiguous, overlapping reads) were determined to be significantly enriched in the DNMT1 RIP as compared to the IgG control (P<0.0001; q<0.0001). A false discovery rate of 7.5% was determined by determining the number of significantly enriched intervals in the IgG immunoprecipitate using DNMT1 as a control. Significantly enriched DNMT1 intervals have a mean length of 347 bp and a median of 67 reads per interval. Every peak represents an interval with a 'height' value: the sum of all reads within an interval. All peaks were annotated with CEAS 33 build on RefSeq hg19. All DNMT1 RIP-Seq peaks were also annotated using the HOMER pipeline (version 4.2) 34 which provide a comprehensive RNAs database (coding and non-coding, including miRNA, snoRNA, rRNA, snRNA, tRNA, etc.).",
