                        "The falling cost of DNA sequencing means that sample quality, rather than expense, is now the blocking issue for many infectious disease genome sequencing projects. Pathogen genomes are generally very small relative to that of their human host, and are typically haploid in nature. Therefore, even a modest number of nucleated human cells present in infectious disease samples may result in the pathogen DNA representation being dwarfed relative to the host human DNA. This difference in representation poses a significant challenge to achieving adequate sequence coverage of the pathogen genome in a cost-effective manner. Separation of host and pathogen cells prior to DNA extraction can be difficult or inconvenient, particularly in field settings common to clinical trials in developing countries. The increasing use of genome-wide association studies to determine the genetic basis of important infectious disease phenotypes, such as drug resistance (Mu et al., Nat. Genet. 2010, 42:268-271), requires sequencing or genotyping hundreds to thousands of pathogen isolates, making a shortage of quality specimens an acute problem.",

                        "To address the problem of sequencing DNA in heterogeneous DNA samples, a solution hybrid selection approach useful for analysis of genomic DNA in samples that contain mixtures of genomic DNA from two or more species, (e.g., a biological sample taken from a subject infected with a pathogen, parasite or symbiont, or commensal organism) has been developed and is described below.",
                        "These approaches, in general, have been carried out using detectably labeled probes that provide coverage of the target organism genome. The baits are hybridized to the target organism genome in the heterogeneous sample and are separated from the contaminating DNA using a binding partner of the detectable label. The enriched DNA from the target organism is then sequenced. As exemplified below, two approaches to bait design have been used. The first approach involves generation of synthetic oligonucleotides that hybridize to specific regions of target organism genome, but do not target the contaminating DNA. The second approach involves the use of fragmented genomic DNA from the target organism as the bait sequence. In either approach, detectably labeled RNA generated from the DNA can be used as bait.",
                        "In one example, biotinylated RNA probes complementary to the pathogen genome are hybridized to pathogen DNA in solution and retrieved with magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. Host DNA is washed away, and the captured pathogen DNA is then eluted and amplified for sequencing or genotyping. This general method has been applied using two different approaches to bait design: (1) synthetic 140 base pair oligonucleotides targeting specific regions of the P. falciparum 3D7 reference genome assembly and (2) \u201cwhole genome baits\u201d (WGB) generated from pure P. falciparum DNA. Using either protocol, significant enrichment of P. falciparum DNA was achieved, allowing for whole genome sequencing on samples which otherwise would have been prohibitively expensive to sequence.",
                        "Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention features a method for enriching the genome of a target organism in a DNA sample that includes both contaminating DNA (e.g., host DNA, for example, mammalian DNA such as human DNA) and DNA of the target organism. The method includes (a) contacting the sample with at least 1,000 (e.g., at least 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 7,500, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 50,000, or 100,000) different, detectably-labeled hybridization bait sequences specific for the target DNA, under conditions in which the bait sequences hybridize to the target organism DNA but do not substantially hybridize to the contaminating DNA; and (b) selectively isolating the hybridized target DNA based on the detectable label, thereby enriching for the genome of the target organism. The method may further include step (c) genotyping or sequencing the isolated target DNA of step (b). The isolated target DNA of step (b) may be amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sample, prior to step (a) contacting, may be subject to shearing and end-labeling (e.g., using end labels that are suitable for sequencing or PCR amplification of the DNA).",
                        "In certain embodiments, most of the DNA in the DNA sample is contaminating DNA (e.g., the ratio of contaminating DNA to target DNA is at least 2:1, 4:1, 10:1, 15:1, 20:1, 30:1, 40:1, 60:1, 80:1, 100:1, 125:1, 150:1, 200:1, 250:1, 300:1, 400:1, or 500:1).",
                        "The hybridization bait sequences may be prepared from the whole genome of the target organism, for example, where the bait sequences are prepared by a method that includes fragmenting genomic DNA of the target organism (e.g., where the fragmented bait sequences are end-labeled with oligonucleotide sequences suitable for PCR amplification or DNA sequencing or where the bait sequences are prepared by a method including attaching an RNA promoter sequence to the genomic DNA fragments and preparing the bait by transcribing (e.g., using biotinylated polynucleotides) the DNA fragments into RNA). The bait sequences may be prepared from specific regions of the target organism genome (e.g., are prepared synthetically). In certain embodiments, the bait sequences are labeled with biotin, a hapten, or an affinity tag or the bait sequences are generated using biotinylated primers, e.g., where the bait sequences are generated by nick-translation labeling of purified target organism DNA with biotinylated deoxynucleotides. In cases where the bait sequences are biotinylated, the target DNA can be captured using a streptavidin molecule attached to a solid phase. The bait sequences may include adapter oligonucleotides suitable for PCR amplification, sequencing, or RNA transcription. The bait sequences may include an RNA promoter or are RNA molecules prepared from DNA containing an RNA promoter (e.g., a T7 RNA promoter).",
                        "The bait sequences may be 60-500 bp in length (e.g., 100-300 bp in length). In certain embodiments, prior to performing step (a), whole genome amplification is performed on the DNA sample. In certain embodiments the hybridization is carried out under high stringency conditions (e.g., at about 65\u00b0 C.).",
                        "The target organism may be a eukaryote, a prokaryote (e.g., a bacterium), an archeal organism, or a virus (e.g., a DNA virus or an RNA virus). The bacterium may be a Gram-negative bacterium a Gram-positive bacterium, a mycobacterium, or a mycoplasma (e.g., any of those described herein). In particular embodiments, the target organism is selected from the group consisting of Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Wolbachia.",

                        "In another aspect, the invention features a method for preparing whole genome bait. The method includes (a) transcribing RNA from fragmented genomic DNA of an organism, the DNA containing adapter sequences (e.g., sequences suitable for PCR amplification) that include an RNA polymerase start site (e.g., a T7 RNA polymerase start site); and (b) detectably labeling the RNA, thereby preparing whole genome bait. The detectable labeling step may be performed in conjunction with the transcribing step. The fragmented genomic DNA may be sheared DNA. The fragmented genomic DNA may average 100-1000, 100-500, 125-400, 150-300, or about 250 bases in length. The detectable label may be, for example, biotin, a hapten, or an affinity tag.

Those skilled in the art will may determine appropriate conditions for any given sample type according to standard methodologies. In one specific example, hybridization is conducted at 65\u00b0 C. for 66 h. This is followed by one wash at RT for 15 min. with 0.5 ml 1\u00d7SSC/0.1% SDS, followed by three 10-min. washes at 65\u00b0 C. with 0.5 ml pre-warmed 0.1\u00d7SSC/0.1% SDS, with re-suspension of the beads containing the target DNA once at each washing step. The skilled artisan may also develop suitable conditions with similar selectivity, depending on the particular sample chosen according to standard methods.",
                        "The present invention provides a cost effective manner for sequencing or performing other analysis of genomic DNA present in samples that contain contaminating DNA, e.g., a sample taken from a subject infected with a pathogen.",
                        "Although sequencing has become considerably less expensive in recent years, it remains financially impracticable to sequence pathogen genomes from biological samples at scale due to the gross excess of host DNA typically present. The simplest way to compensate for host DNA contamination is to augment sequencing coverage depth. However, this strategy can be costly for all but the most lightly contaminated samples. In contrast, the current cost of purification by hybrid selection using WGB, for example, is approximately $250 (US), which is roughly equivalent to the current cost of generating 20-fold coverage of the 23 Mb P. falciparum genome from pure template using a fraction of an Illumina HiSeq lane. For augmented coverage to be an affordable strategy relative to hybrid selection for a target coverage level of 40\u00d7 in a genome of this size, samples must contain at least 50% pathogen DNA. This titer of parasite DNA is rarely found in biological samples unless white cell purification is performed prior to DNA extraction. For a more typical biological sample containing only 1% P. falciparum DNA, hybrid selection resulting in 40-fold enrichment enables 40\u00d7 coverage depth for a dramatically lower total current price (\u02dc$1,000) than deeper sequencing of the unpurified sample (\u02dc$40,000).",
                        "The modest cost and high performance of this hybrid selection purification protocol can facilitate sequencing of archival biological samples of malaria parasites and other pathogens that were previously considered unfit for sequencing by any methodology. Indeed, this can enable sequencing of important samples stored on filter papers or diagnostic slides predating the spread of drug resistance or associated with historic outbreaks. This purification protocol also broadens the accessibility of sequencing for biological samples of infectious organisms for which in vitro culture is possible but costly or inconvenient, such as Class IV \u201cselect agents\u201d recognized by the CDC. This protocol is not limited to pathogens or parasites, and should be equally useful in sequencing commensal or symbiotic organisms closely associated with their host, such as intracellular Wolbachia bacteria. The reduction in sample quality and quantity requirements permitted by this method simplifies protocol design in large-scale clinical studies and can help realize the benefits of inexpensive, massively parallel sequencing technologies for studying infectious diseases in diverse contexts.",

                        "In general, the methods described herein involve generation of labeled bait sequences that cover all or a substantial portion of the target genome which are used to isolate and enrich the target DNA as compared to the contaminating or host DNA. This enriched sample is then suitable for sequencing using techniques known in the art. An exemplary strategy for hybridization is shown in FIG. 1.",
                        "As described below, hybrid selection was performed with two classes of bait (synthetic and WGB) on a mock clinical sample consisting of 99% human DNA and 1% Plasmodium DNA by mass, which falls within the range of DNA ratios found in many malaria clinical samples (Table 1). Hybridization and washing steps (described below) were carried out under standard high stringency conditions to reduce capture of contaminating, host DNA. The hybrid selection protocol requires a minimum of 2 \u03bcg of input DNA (combined host and pathogen), a quantity which may not be available from many types of field samples. Therefore, hybrid selection was also performed with both bait classes on 2 \u03bcg of WGA DNA generated from 10 ng of the mock clinical sample. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis indicated that WGA does not significantly alter the fraction of malaria DNA present in the sample (post WGA % P. falciparum DNA=1.1+/\u22120.1).",
                        "In summary, both bait strategies performed effectively and offer methods to sequence either targeted regions or complete genomes of pathogens in biological samples dominated by host DNA. Pairing this hybrid selection protocol with WGA further expands the range of biological samples now eligible for efficient pathogen genome sequencing. For example, for Plasmodium it is now possible to sequence the genome from dried blood spots on filter paper, an easily collectable and storable sample format."

                                "Another approach is to use the pathogen genome itself as WGB to generate the baits used in the methods described herein. Here, genomic DNA from the pathogen is processed into smaller pieces using any technique known in the art, such as shearing. Shearing can be controlled to ensure that particular size fragments are generated. In one example, fragments of about 250 bp in length were produced, although the skilled artisan would readily be able to determine appropriate lengths for such fragments. Following fragmentation, various steps, including end repair, addition of adapters, and clean up (e.g., using Qiagen kits) can then be performed. Amplification of the DNA can be performed by PCR. RNA promoters (e.g., the T7 promoter) or other functional sequences can also be added, e.g., as part of the adapter sequence or by further PCR. Labeled RNA can be generated, for example, by transcribing the RNA in the presence of labeled nucleotides. Additional approaches for bait sequence design are described in PCT Publication WO 2009/099602.",

With a genome-wide A/T composition of 81% (Gardner et al., Nature 2002, 419:498-511), achieving uniform sequencing coverage of the P. falciparum genome is challenging even under ideal circumstances. No reduction in coverage uniformity as a result of the hybrid selection process was observed. WGA did not compromise mean genome-wide sequencing coverage relative to unamplified input DNA (67.5\u00d7 vs. 67.1\u00d7 for a single Illumina GAIIx lane, respectively). Sequencing coverage of the samples hybrid selected using synthetic 140 bp baits was tightly localized to the genomic regions to which baits were designed (FIG. 5b). Coverage levels in baited regions that were significantly higher than what is observed from comparable sequencing of pure P. falciparum DNA. This indicates that hybrid selection with synthetic baits may be useful not only for reducing off-target coverage in the host genome, but also for strategically augmenting coverage levels in regions of pathogen genomes where heightened sequence coverage could be informative, such as highly polymorphic antigenic regions subject to host immune pressure. Results of such sequencing are shown in FIG. 6.",

Genome-wide coverage is depicted in FIG. 7a, which illustrates that the extent of the genome covered to various thresholds is highly similar for the pure P. falciparum and hybrid selected mock clinical samples, and significantly higher than simulated coverage levels we would have predicted to be observed from sequencing an unpurified version of the sample. Genome-wide coverage levels as a function of local % GC (% G+C) are plotted in FIG. 7b for the WGB experiments. The relationship between % GC and coverage observed in whole genome shotgun sequencing data is decreased by hybrid selection due to reduced coverage in rare high % GC genomic regions (Spearman's rs for % GC vs. coverage of pure malaria DNA: 0.86; vs. WGB hybrid selected DNA: 0.59; vs. WGA+WGB hybrid selected DNA: 0.64). The vertical line in FIG. 7b represents the average % GC of exonic sequence (23%). Assuming a minimum threshold of 10-fold sequencing coverage is required for accurate SNP calling, 99.2% of exonic bases exhibited this coverage or greater in reads generated from the pure P. falciparum DNA sample. The unamplified and amplified hybrid selected samples achieved at least 10-fold coverage for 98.3% and 98.0% of exonic bases, respectively.

                                "To test this application, we performed WGA and hybrid selection on DNA extracted from a clinical P. falciparum sample (Th231.08) collected on filter paper in Thies, Senegal in 2008 and stored at room temperature for over a year. By qPCR, the Plasmodium DNA in the original sample was estimated to comprise approximately 0.11% of the total DNA by mass. Following WGA and hybrid selection, Plasmodium DNA represented 7.7% of total DNA present, an approximately 70-fold increase in parasite DNA representation. Illumina HiSeq sequencing data confirmed that at least 5.9% of map-able reads in the hybrid selected sample corresponded to Plasmodium. The fraction of human reads after hybrid selection remained high due to the extreme initial ratio of host:parasite DNA, but the enrichment factor in this case was sufficient to rescue the feasibility of sequencing this sample. A total of 26,366 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified relative to the P. falciparum reference assembly (more than 1 per kb), close to the number of SNPs identified (33,094 - 41,123) from 11 other culture-adapted Senegalese parasite lines sequenced without hybrid selection. Principal components analysis of SNP genotypes confirms the similar genomic profile of the hybrid selected and non-hybrid selected Senegalese strains, as well as hybrid selected and non-hybrid selected 3D7 reference strain datasets generated from sequencing the mock clinical samples (FIG. 8). Despite the use of WGB generated from the 3D7 reference genome, the DNA captured from the Senegal isolate has the SNP profile of Senegal DNA, rather than 3D7 DNA, suggesting that polymorphisms do not strongly bias enrichment. In addition, the highly polymorphic regions of the isolate did not suffer a relative drop in sequencing coverage after hybrid selection. Hybrid selection of a panel of 12 other clinical malaria samples from Senegal yielded an average of 35-fold enrichment, as measured by qPCR (Table 1), with enrichment amount inversely proportional to the initial fraction of parasite DNA in the samples.",
                                "A second round of hybrid selection was conducted on the Th231.08 clinical sample to determine whether Plasmodium DNA titer could be boosted above approximately 7%. The second round of hybrid selection was carried out under identical hybridization and wash conditions. qPCR analysis indicates this yielded a sample in which 47.5% of the genetic material was Plasmodium by mass (a 6.7 fold enrichment). This lower fold enrichment is consistent with our previous observation that fold enrichment is inversely proportional to initial parasite DNA titer, but in this case yields a sample highly amenable to cost-efficient and deep sequencing."
