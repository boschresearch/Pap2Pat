    "abstract": "Cancer cells exhibit elevated lipid synthesis. In breast and other cancer types, genes involved in lipid production are highly upregulated, but the mechanisms that control their expression remain poorly understood. Using integrated transcriptomic, lipidomic, and molecular studies, here we report that DAXX is a regulator of oncogenic lipogenesis. DAXX depletion attenuates, while its overexpression enhances, lipogenic gene expression, lipogenesis, and tumor growth. Mechanistically, DAXX interacts with SREBP1 and SREBP2 and activates SREBP-mediated transcription. DAXX associates with lipogenic gene promoters through SREBPs. Underscoring the critical roles for the DAXX-SREBP interaction for lipogenesis, SREBP2 knockdown attenuates tumor growth in cells with DAXX overexpression, and DAXX mutants unable to bind SREBP1/2 have weakened activity in promoting lipogenesis and tumor growth. Remarkably, a DAXX mutant deficient of SUMO-binding fails to activate SREBP1/2 and lipogenesis due to impaired SREBP binding and chromatin recruitment and is defective of stimulating tumorigenesis. Hence, DAXX's SUMO-binding activity is critical to oncogenic lipogenesis. Notably, a peptide corresponding to DAXX's C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM2) is cell-membrane permeable, disrupts the DAXX-SREBP1/2 interactions, and inhibits lipogenesis and tumor growth. These results establish DAXX as a regulator of lipogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.",

                "Cancer cells exhibit elevated intracellular lipid synthesis, resulting in increased levels of fatty acids (FAs), membrane phospholipids, and cholesterol1,2. Notably, normal non-proliferating cells generally rely on the uptake of lipids from the circulation for homeostasis. In contrast, highly proliferative cancer cells show strong avidity to acquire elevated lipids and cholesterol through either enhancing the uptake of exogenous (or dietary) lipids and lipoproteins or activating their endogenous lipid synthesis mechanisms, including de novo lipogenesis from non-lipid sources such as glucose and acetate1\u20134. Increased lipid production in cancer cells is thought to supply lipids for the synthesis of membranes and signaling molecules during rapid cell proliferation and tumor growth, due to limited availability of lipids in the tumor microenvironment1,5. Lipid synthesis is controlled by several transcription factors, such as the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, SREBP1 and SREBP2 (SREBP1/2), that have been shown to play an important role in maintaining lipid synthesis in cancer6. SREBP1/2 precursors are sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum. When sterol supply is low, SREBP1/2 are transported to the Golgi apparatus where they are cleaved by proteases, and their N-terminal domain consisting of a basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper DNA-binding domain is then released and imported into the nucleus to promote transcription of genes that contain the sterol regulatory elements (SREs) required for lipid synthesis7\u201310.",
                "Independently of intracellular lipid levels, oncogenic drivers, including KRAS and PI3K, promote de novo lipogenesis in breast cancer (BC) and other cancer types converging on mTORC1 activation1,11\u201313. mTORC1 promotes S6K1-dependent SREBP1/2 processing14. The phosphatidate phosphatase Lipin-1 sequesters mature SREBP1/2 in a subnuclear compartment separated from DNAs, thereby preventing SREBP1/2 from activating gene expression. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates Lipin-1, which inhibits its nuclear translocation and thus restores SREBP activity15. mTOR signaling also indirectly stabilizes SREBP1/2 by opposing phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of SREBP1/2 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 and subsequent proteasomal degradation16\u201318. mTORC1 is shown to phosphorylate the acetyltransferase and transcription coactivator p300 to enhance its acetyltransferase activity, thereby increasing lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis19. Notably, tumors efficiently convert acetate to acetyl-CoA20, which is predominantly used for lipid synthesis21, highlighting the need for cancer cells to produce lipogenic enzymes22. While the dependence on de novo lipogenesis in cancer is well documented, the mechanisms that control SREBP-mediated transcription underlying oncogenic de novo lipogenesis remain poorly understood.",
                "DAXX, originally discovered as a context-dependent regulator of cell death or survival23\u201325, has an extensively documented role in transcription regulation through interacting with transcription factors, including p5326 and NF-\u03baB27. We and others have reported that DAXX is a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-binding protein via two SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) and that the SUMO-binding property of DAXX appears critical for it to regulate transcription25,28\u201330. More recent studies have defined DAXX as a specific chaperone for the histone variant H3.331\u201333 that may have important roles in regulating chromatin structure, including chromatin binding of transcription factors such as p5334. Interestingly, DAXX is shown to act as an ATP-independent chaperone to prevent abnormal protein aggregation35. DAXX binds specifically to the H3.3/H4 dimer and deposits it onto chromatin36,37. Emerging evidence suggests that DAXX has an oncogenic role in diverse cancer types38,39, which appears to be linked to its functions in gene regulation39,40. Whereas the levels of DAXX expression directly correlate with its ability to promote tumor growth25,38\u201341, the molecular mechanisms underlying DAXX\u2019s oncogenic function have begun to emerge. Of critical importance is to understand whether DAXX is a tractable therapeutic target for cancer therapy.",
                "In this work, DAXX is identified as a regulator of oncogenic lipogenesis through its interaction with SREBP1/2, leading to activating lipogenic gene expression programs and the promotion of cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Notably, a SUMO-binding defective DAXX mutant cannot bind SREBP2, stimulate lipogenesis, and accelerate tumor growth. Moreover, a DAXX SIM-derived peptide (SIM2) blocks the DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction, lipogenic gene expression, de novo lipogenesis and tumor growth. Thus, the DAXX SIM/SUMO interface represents a potentially tractable therapeutic target with the SIM2 peptide. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized oncogenic pathway in BC and suggests a potential therapeutic approach for cancer therapy."

                        "Bioinformatic analyses of clinical BC samples revealed that DAXX mRNA levels are elevated in all four major BC subtypes and correlate with poor prognosis (Supplementary Fig. S1) and BC metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S2)25. Consistently, the levels of cholesterol and other lipids are higher in BC samples compared to normal controls42 (Supplementary Fig. S1c). To understand a potential oncogenic role of DAXX, we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches. We genetically depleted endogenous DAXX, overexpressed wild-type (WT) DAXX, or a mutant in which both SIM1 and SIM2 (I7K/I733K or DSM) required for binding to SUMO are disabled28 in the triple-negative BC (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a01a). Microarray-based RNA profiling and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes in cells with DAXX mRNA knockdown (KD) and WT DAXX overexpression (OE) in comparison to control cells revealed a marked downregulation and upregulation, respectively, of the de novo lipogenesis pathway. Remarkably, DSM OE failed to activate the lipogenesis pathway (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013d). Lipogenesis regulators (SREBF1/2 encoding SREBP1/2 and SCAP) were among top inhibited upstream regulators in the KD cells, while WT DAXX OE activated SREBF1/2 (Fig.\u00a01c). Concordantly, the cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway were among the top pathways identified by IPA (Fig.\u00a01d). Most of the genes in the core cholesterol biosynthesis pathway are affected by DAXX expression levels (Fig.\u00a01b). Notably, expression of these genes was either unaffected or moderately reduced in cells with DSM OE (Fig.\u00a01b). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of mRNA microarray data confirmed suppression and activation of the de novo lipogenesis pathway by DAXX KD and WT OE, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3a). Of note, several transcriptional regulators that are known to interact with DAXX such as JUN and PML25 were also affected by DAXX expression levels. Interestingly, the insulin receptor (INSR) pathway that regulates intracellular lipid production43 also seems to be positively regulated by DAXX (Fig.\u00a01c).Fig. 1DAXX promotes lipogenic gene expression and its SUMO-binding property is required.a Validation of shRNA-mediated DAXX knockdown (KD) and the overexpression of wild-type DAXX (WT OE) and the SUMO-binding defective mutant (DSM OE) compared to cells with a control vector (CTL) in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunoblotting. b An expression heatmap of selected genes in the lipogenesis pathway in MDA-MB-231-derived cells (CTL, KD, wt OE, and DSM OE) based on microarray data (triplicates for each group). c, d Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for upstream regulators (c) and canonical pathways (d) using differentially expressed genes in KD, WT, and DSM OE cells compared to CTL cells based on the mRNA microarray data as in (b).

                        "RT-qPCR data for several genes provided validation for the microarray results (Fig.\u00a01e). The impact of DAXX KD or OE on lipogenic gene expression was further validated by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting (Supplementary Fig. S3b, c). Using a tetracycline-inducible gene expression system, we found that DAXX induction increased lipogenic gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S3d), providing further evidence that DAXX directly activates lipogenic gene expression. In keeping with our findings, our analysis of public gene expression datasets based on human and mouse cells44\u201346 indicated that DAXX is involved in promoting the SREBP/lipogenesis pathway (Supplementary Fig. S4). Further analyses of clinical BC data indicate that DAXX expression levels positively correlate with that of SREBF1 and SREBF2 (Supplementary Fig. S4d) and a panel of lipogenic genes (Supplementary Fig. S1e). Our previous analysis indicated that DAXX is upregulated in BC metastases25. As FA synthesis47 and more broadly the SREBP1 lipogenesis pathway enhance BC brain metastasis48, we analyzed mRNA levels of DAXX and lipogenic genes in BC metastases in different distant organs and found that DAXX and genes of selected lipogenic enzymes are consistently and significantly upregulated in BC brain metastases (Supplementary Fig. S2). Collectively, these data provide evidence that DAXX may have an oncogenic function by promoting lipogenic gene expression and that the integrity of both DAXX SIMs appears critical for this property."

                        "SREBP1/2 are master transcription factors that promote lipid production when the intracellular levels of lipids/sterols are low6. Because DAXX expression levels positively correlate with the activation of the\u00a0SREBP/lipid biosynthesis pathway (Fig.\u00a01), we reasoned that DAXX could regulate lipid biosynthesis through interacting with SREBP1/2. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of total cell extracts with an anti-DAXX antibody evidenced co-precipitation of two SREBP1/2 proteins that correspond to the SREBP precursor (full-length or FL) and cleaved mature (M) forms (Fig.\u00a02a, b). Note that the apparent molecular weight (MW) of the SREBP2 precursor co-precipitated with DAXX appears larger than the calculated MW of the reference FL SREBP2 (~125\u2009kDa) and this was detected by two different anti-SREBP2 antibodies (Fig.\u00a02a, b). The expression of a larger SREBP2 isoform has been validated in multiple cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6) and in the literature49,50, possibly due to differential posttranslational modifications. Endogenous as well as exogenous DAXX was co-immunoprecipitated with transiently expressed FLAG-tagged mature SREBP1a, SREBP1c, or SREBP2, as well as transfected FL SREBP1 and SREBP2 (Supplementary Fig. S6a, b). Using Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) with a mouse monoclonal anti-DAXX and a rabbit polyclonal anti-SREBP1 or SREBP2 antibody, endogenous DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 interaction signals were detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a02c, d). Interestingly, the number of DAXX/SREBP1/2 PLA signals was significantly increased in the absence of serum (Fig.\u00a02c), suggesting that low extracellular supply of lipids might enhance the DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 interaction.Fig. 2DAXX binds to SREBP1 and SREBP2 and the DAXX SIMs are important for DAXX-SREBP2 interaction.a, b The endogenous DAXX and SREBP1/2 interact.

                        "Using various DAXX deletion constructs in transfected 293T cells, we found that the mature SREBP2 protein interacted with two separate regions of DAXX, the N-terminal part encompassing the well-folded helical bundle termed 4HB (DAXX helical bundle)51 and a part of the central histone-binding domain (HBD)36 (Fig.\u00a02e\u2013g). Interestingly, although 4HB and HBD individually bound robustly to SREBP2 (Fig.\u00a02f lanes 3 and 4 and Fig.\u00a02g lanes 1 and 3), the integrity of both binding sites in the context of the full-length DAXX or a longer construct appeared critical for the DAXX-SREBP2 interaction. Indeed, mutations within 4HB (I127A, del 129\u2013132) (Fig.\u00a02f, lane 5) or HBD (del 327\u2013335, Fig.\u00a02e, lane 3 and Fig. 2f, lane 6; del 191\u2013242, Fig.\u00a02f, lane 7) abolished the DAXX-SREBP2 interaction. Notably, the DAXX construct (aa 1\u2013437) lacking the sequence from the acidic domain to the C-terminus seemed to show higher affinity to SERBP2 (Fig.\u00a02f, lane 8). Deletions of C-terminal regions of DAXX did not affect the DAXX-SREBP2 interaction (Fig.\u00a02f, g). The mature SREBP1a bound to DAXX in a similar fashion (Fig.\u00a02h). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed DAXX/SREBP1 colocalization (Supplementary Fig. S7). Significantly, the I7K or I733K mutations individually or in combination (I7K/I733K or DSM) markedly attenuated the interactions between DAXX and mature SREBP2 (Fig.\u00a02i, lanes 2\u20134 and Fig.\u00a02j). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the mature SREBP1/2 specifically interact with DAXX via DAXX\u2019s 4HB and HBD, and that both SIMs of DAXX are important for the DAXX\u2013SREBP interactions (Fig.\u00a02k)."

                        "To assess the functional impact of DAXX on lipogenesis, de novo lipogenesis assays using [14C]-acetate metabolic labeling were conducted. Data shown in Fig.\u00a03a confirmed that DAXX expression levels positively correlate with levels of intracellular lipid synthesis, with reduced or increased lipid levels in DAXX KD or WT OE MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. However, the DSM mutant did not alter de novo lipogenesis (Fig.\u00a03a). Consistently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomic profiling revealed that DAXX KD reduced, but WT OE increased, levels of specific lipid molecules. The DSM mutant was impaired to promote lipid production compared to WT DAXX (Fig.\u00a03b and Supplementary Fig. S8a). DAXX depletion through CRISPR/Cas9 also reduced lipid production in MDA-MB-231 cells, providing an independent validation (Supplementary Fig. S8b). To determine a broader role of DAXX in lipogenesis in cancer, we depleted endogenous DAXX or overexpressed DAXX in several cancer cell lines. In the TNBC MDA-MB-468 cell line, DAXX expression levels positively correlated with lipid production based on [14C]-acetate labeling experiments as well as lipidomic profiling. Again, the DSM mutant displayed a loss-of-function phenotype in lipogenesis (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e and Supplementary Fig. S8c). Diminished de novo lipogenesis upon DAXX depletion was also observed in BC cell lines of luminal subtypes (MCF7 and T47D) and the colon cancer cell line HCT116 (Supplementary Fig. S8d).

                        "The data presented above suggest that DAXX promotes SREBP-mediated transcription to stimulate lipogenesis. To test this idea, we conducted luciferase reporter assays. As shown in Fig.\u00a04a, forced expression of mature SREBP2, SREBP1a, and SREBP1c by transient transfection increased the activity of the luciferase reporter that is under the control of the SREBF2 promoter containing a canonical SRE. Co-expression of DAXX further increased the luciferase activity, while DAXX alone had only minimal effects. In contrast, the DAXX DSM mutant was largely defective to coactivate SREBP1/2-mediated transcription (Fig.\u00a04a).Fig. 4DAXX activates SREBP-mediated transcription and occupies the promoters of lipogenic genes.a MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter fragment from the SREBF2 gene along with mature SREBP2, SREBP1a, SREBP1c, wt DAXX or the DSM mutant cDNA as indicated.

                        "We surveyed genome-wide occupancy of DAXX using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology. Overexpression of WT DAXX, but not the DSM mutant, increased DAXX\u2019s chromatin association (Fig.\u00a04b, c). Consistent with other studies44, DAXX primarily bound to sites in introns and intergenic regions with less frequent association with promoters (Fig.\u00a04d). A de novo motif analysis revealed that SREBP-binding elements were significantly enriched in DAXX-associated sites (Fig.\u00a04e).",
                        "Notably, the DAXX DSM mutant exhibited reduced overall chromatin association (Fig.\u00a04b, c) as well as diminished occupancy at individual lipogenic genes compared to WT DAXX (Fig.\u00a04f and Supplementary Fig. S9). De novo motif analysis indicated that the SREBP1 motif was less significantly enriched, while the enrichment of the SREBP2 motif was insignificant in anti-DAXX-precipitated chromatins from MDA-MB-231 DSM OE cells (Supplementary Fig. S9a). ChIP-qPCR experiments using an antibody against DAXX or the FLAG epitope demonstrated that WT DAXX but not the DSM mutant (both WT and DSM DAXX carrying an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag) was enriched in the promoters of FASN, ACACA and SREBF2 (Fig.\u00a04g). Notably, DAXX was not enriched in the 3\u2019 UTR of FASN and ACACA (Fig.\u00a04g), indicating that DAXX is specifically recruited to the promoter regions of lipogenesis genes. In MDA-MB-231 cells depleted of SREBP2, DAXX\u2019s recruitment to the promoters of FASN, ACACA and SREBP2 was reduced (Fig.\u00a04h), demonstrating that SREBP2 is critical for DAXX to bind the promoters of lipogenic genes. Together with the data showing that the DSM mutant was impaired for binding to SREBP2 (Fig.\u00a02i), these ChIP and the luciferase reporter assay results show that DAXX is recruited to the lipogenic gene promoters by SREBP, and that the SUMO-binding activity of DAXX is critical for efficient recruitment of DAXX to the SREBP-bound chromatin. These results suggest a probable molecular explanation for the inability of the DSM mutant to activate lipogenic gene expression and de novo lipogenesis."

                        "Because DAXX promotes SREBP-mediated gene expression and de novo lipogenesis (Figs.\u00a01\u20134), and the maintenance of lipid production by SREBPs is critical for cell proliferation and tumor growth5,6,52, we hypothesized that DAXX expression levels impact cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Indeed, DAXX KD reduced the number and size of colonies when compared to the control, while WT DAXX OE had the opposite effects in the three-dimensional cell culture model of MDA-MB-231. In contrast, the DAXX DSM mutant had no effect on either colony size or number (Supplementary Fig. S10).",
                        "Next, we examined effects of DAXX expression levels on tumor growth in vivo. In orthotopic BC xenograft models using female mice, DAXX KD markedly reduced, while WT DAXX OE significantly increased, tumor growth of both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Notably, the MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors grew more aggressively than the MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Notwithstanding, the effects of DAXX expression levels on tumor growth were observed in both TNBC tumor models. The DSM mutant OE did not affect tumor growth in either MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-468 xenograft models (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Immunoblotting analysis of tumor extracts showed that the levels of the WT DAXX and DSM mutant protein were similar (Fig.\u00a05c), indicating that the inability of the DSM mutant to promote tumor growth was not due to differences in protein expression levels. We profiled the lipids in xenograft tumors derived from cells with different levels of DAXX expression and found that the expression levels of WT DAXX positively correlated with levels of lipids, but the DSM OE had no such effects (Fig.\u00a05d).Fig. 5WT DAXX but not the SUMO-binding defective mutant (DSM) promotes tumor growth in vivo.a, b Cell lines derived from MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-468 stably transduced with a control vector (Control), DAXX shRNA (KD), wild-type DAXX cDNA (WT OE), or the mutant defective of SUMO-binding (DSM OE) were implanted into mammary fat pads of female NSG mice.

Consistent with the BC xenograft tumor models, DSM mutant OE was unable to promote in vivo tumor growth in the colon and prostate cancer xenograft models (Supplementary Fig. S11a, b). In mouse tumor models, Daxx depletion also markedly impaired tumor growth in immunocompetent (C57BL/6) and immunodeficient (NSG) mouse hosts (Supplementary Fig. S11c, d).

We have depleted the endogenous SREBF1/2 or overexpressed the mature form of SREBP1a and SREBP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a06a). SREBF1/2 KD reduced de novo lipogenesis from acetate (Fig.\u00a06b) and tumor growth in vivo (Fig.\u00a06c, d), whereas the overexpression of mature SREBP1/2 increased lipogenesis and tumor growth (Fig.\u00a06b\u2013d). Concordantly, lipidomic profiling shows that SREBP1/2 KD had a marked impact on cellular lipidome (Fig.\u00a06e, f). These data indicate that both SREBP1/2 are important mediators of lipogenesis and tumorigenesis. Our data presented above demonstrated that the DAXX\u2013SREBP interactions are critical for lipogenic gene expression, lipid synthesis and tumor growth. To further link SREBP2 to DAXX-mediated tumorigenesis, we depleted SREBF2 in MDA-MB-231 cells with WT DAXX OE. We observed that SREBF2 KD in the DAXX OE cells significantly attenuated the levels of lipogenic enzymes and tumor growth (Fig.\u00a06g, h), implying that SREBP2 is a critical effector of DAXX\u2019s oncogenic function.Fig. 6SREBP1, SREBP2, and the DAXX\u2013SREBP axis promote lipid synthesis and tumor growth.a Cells derived from MDA-MB-231 cell line with a vector for a control, an SREBF1 shRNA (KD), or SREBP1a (mature) cDNA, an SREBF2 shRNA (KD), or SREBP2 (mature) cDNA were subjected to RT-qPCR for assessing the expression of SREBF1 and SREBF2. b\u00a0The panel of cell lines in (a) were tested for de novo lipogenesis assays using [1-14C] acetate.\u00a0In (a, b), the P values were calculated using ordinary one-way ANOVA (n\u2009=\u20093 biologically independent samples). c, d The panel of MDA-MB-231-derived cell line shown in (a) were xenografted into mammary fat pads of female NSG mice (n\u2009=\u20093 tumor-bearing mice).

                        "To further assess the importance of DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction on lipid synthesis, we overexpressed a DAXX mutant (del 327\u2013335) defective of SREBP1 or SREBP2 binding (Fig.\u00a02e, h) in MDA-MB-231 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of both WT DAXX and the del 327\u2013335 mutant were similar (Fig.\u00a07a, b). A de novo lipogenesis assay using [14C]-acetate labeling indicated that the del 327\u2013331 mutant attenuated lipogeneses (Fig.\u00a07c). Lipidomic profiling revealed that MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the del 327\u2013335 mutant has a distinct global lipid profile from that of cells expressing the WT DAXX (Fig.\u00a07d\u2013i) and that this mutant was impaired to enhance lipid production, including glycerolipids/glycerophospholipids, sterols, and FAs compared to WT DAXX (Fig.\u00a07f\u2013i). In vivo, the growth of xenograft tumors derived from cells expressing the del 327\u2013335 mutant was significantly slower than that derived from cells with WT DAXX (Fig.\u00a07j). These data collectively indicate that the DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 interaction is critical for DAXX to promote lipid synthesis and tumorigenesis (Fig.\u00a07k).Fig. 7The DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction is critical for lipid synthesis and tumor growth.a Relative mRNA levels of DAXX in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the WT or del 327\u2013335 mutant cDNA of DAXX as determined by RT-qPCR (n\u2009=\u20092). b DAXX protein levels in control cells and those with KD, WT and del 327\u2013335 mutant cDNA of DAXX. c The DAXX del 327\u2013337 mutant impaired de novo lipogenesis.

                        "DAXX\u2019s SUMO-binding property is critical to the DAXX-SREBP2 interaction (Fig.\u00a02), de novo lipogenesis (Fig.\u00a03), DAXX\u2019s recruitment to lipogenic genes (Fig.\u00a04), and in vivo tumor growth (Fig.\u00a05). We hypothesized that blocking the interface between DAXX SIMs and SUMOs impairs the DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction, lipid biosynthesis, and tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of DAXX (amino acids 729\u2013740). This synthetic peptide encompasses the C-terminal SIM of DAXX (termed SIM2). Unexpectedly, SIM2 rapidly internalized into cells (Supplementary Fig. S12a), suggesting that it is a cell-membrane permeable peptide that does not require specific modifications such as hydrocarbon staple or attaching to a cell-penetrating sequence53. SIM2 bound to SUMO1 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S12b) and blocked de novo lipogenesis in various types of cancer cells, including breast (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T), prostate (R1-AD1 and R1-D567), colon (HCT116), and mouse tumor cells (4T1 and CT26.CL25) (Supplementary Fig. S12c\u2013h). SIM2 also effectively inhibited de novo lipogenesis in MDA-MB-231 WT DAXX OE cells (Supplementary Fig. S12c), and the in vitro growth of MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S12i). Moreover, SIM2 blocked the expression of lipogenic genes, and the inhibition appeared more potent when DAXX expression level was high (Supplementary Fig. S12j).",
                        "Mechanistically, SIM2 inhibited the interaction of DAXX with full-length and mature SREBP1/2, while DAXX\u2019s interaction with ATRX was largely unaffected (Fig.\u00a08a), suggesting SIM2 specifically weakens the DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction. To test in vivo efficacy of SIM2 on tumor growth, orthotopic human MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were generated in the mammary fat pads of female NSG mice. As shown in Fig.\u00a08b, SIM2 significantly impeded tumor growth, and at the experimental endpoint, the tumor masses were significantly smaller in the SIM2 treatment group compared to the vehicle control group. In a syngeneic mouse mammary tumor model, mouse 4T1 cell line (derived from a spontaneous mouse mammary tumor with human basal/TNBC characteristics54) was transplanted into mammary fat pads of female immunocompetent BALB/c mice. 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were dosed with vehicle or SIM2. Consistent with the MDA-MB-231 xenograft results (Fig.\u00a08b), SIM2 effectively inhibited the 4T1 tumor growth (Fig.\u00a08c). SIM2 peptide appeared safe in vivo, as there was no difference in the body weights of mice in the control and SIM2 dosing group (Fig.\u00a08b, c). To understand the potential mechanism of action of SIM2, MDA-MB-231 tumor extracts were subjected to immunoblotting. Interestingly, the protein levels of DAXX, SREBP2, and FASN were lower in the SIM2 treatment group compared to the control group (Fig.\u00a08d), suggesting that SIM2 acts to downregulate the DAXX-driven lipogenesis pathway. Lipidomic profiling of MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor samples from each treatment group revealed a marked suppression of lipid production by SIM2 (Fig.\u00a08e). Collectively, these data support a model in which SIM2 exerts its antitumor ability by blocking the DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction, lipogenic gene expression, and lipid production (Fig.\u00a08f).Fig. 8The DAXX SIM2 peptide disrupts the DAXX\u2013SREBP interactions and suppresses tumor growth in vivo.a MDA-MB-231 cell extracts were subjected to anti-DAXX IP in the absence (0) or the presence of SIM2 (1 and 5\u2009\u00b5M).

                "Lipid availability for proliferating cells determines the activity of intracellular lipid biosynthesis pathway. In a nutrient-poor tumor microenvironment, limited supplies of lipids necessitate the activation of intracellular lipid production in tumor cells for sustained tumor growth. An elaborate sterol sensing machinery controls the cleavage and nuclear translocation of SREBP1/2, which promote expression of enzymes required for de novo lipogenesis1,55. SREBP1/2 in conjunction with other transcription factors, such as the E-box-binding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor USF1, activate expression of lipogenic enzymes and regulators43. Other coregulators of gene expression such as acetyltransferases (e.g., p300 and PCAF) as well as oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., KRAS and mTOR) also play important roles in stimulating de novo lipogenesis12,56. We demonstrated here that DAXX is a regulator for de novo lipogenesis. Mechanistically, DAXX interacts with SREBP1/2 and is enriched in chromatins containing SRE motifs. Importantly, DAXX mutants that cannot bind SREBP1/2 are unable to promote lipogenesis and tumor growth. SREBP2 downregulation reduced tumor growth driven by DAXX OE. Hence, our data support a model by which DAXX enhances lipogenesis through interacting with SREBP1/2 to promote lipogenic gene expression, lipid production, and tumorigenesis.",
                "Significantly, the SUMO-binding property of DAXX appears important for DAXX\u2019s interaction with SREBP2, chromatin recruitment, de novo lipogenesis and tumor growth. In support of this, we found that the SIM2 peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal SIM of DAXX, inhibits de novo lipogenesis and suppresses in vivo tumor growth (Fig.\u00a08 and Supplementary Fig. S12). SIM2 blocks the DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 interactions, and the treatment with SIM2 reduces lipid levels and downregulation of DAXX, SREBP2, and FASN in vivo (Fig.\u00a08 and Supplementary Fig. S12). Hence, the inhibition of DAXX/SREBP pathway by SIM2 blocks de novo lipogenesis, which may underlie SIM2-mediated antitumor effects. SIM2 has a unique sequence and displays a high affinity to SUMO1 upon phosphorylation25,29. Notably, peptides generally do not penetrate cell membranes. However, SIM2 is spontaneously and rapidly internalized into cells (Supplementary Fig. S12a) and is well tolerated by animals (Fig.\u00a08). Overall, our data indicate that the interface between DAXX SIM and SUMO represents a potentially tractable therapeutic target to inhibit de novo lipogenesis for cancer therapy. Our data also highlight the therapeutic potential of SIM2 as a novel class of cancer therapeutics, which has implications for developing peptide-based drugs.",
                "SUMOylation of nuclear proteins such as transcription factors and core histone proteins is extensively documented57,58, and SUMOs are highly enriched in the core promoters/enhancers of actively transcribed genes59\u201361. Of relevance to this study, SUMOs have been detected in some gene promoters regulated by SREBP1/2 (e.g., ACLY)60. Other studies demonstrated that DAXX\u2019s SUMO-binding property is essential for DAXX\u2019s recruitment to chromatin and histone H3.3 deposition62,63. Our data show that SIM2 preferentially disrupted the DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 interactions with little effects on the DAXX-ATRX interaction (Fig.\u00a08a), and that the DSM mutant could neither bind to mature SREBP2 (Fig.\u00a02i) nor be effectively recruited to chromatins (Fig.\u00a04). Disruption of either of the two SIMs in DAXX weakened its interaction with mature SREBP2 (Fig.\u00a02i). Both SREBP1/2 are SUMOylated at multiple sites64\u201366. Likewise, DAXX is also SUMOylated at a number of lysine residues25,30,57,58. However, SREBPs lack recognizable SUMO-binding domains including SIMs. Collectively, our data, suggest that, via its two SIMs, DAXX may bind preferentially to SUMO-modified SREBPs, and that blocking the DAXX SIM/SUMO interface may weaken the DAXX\u2013SREBP interactions, thereby impairing DAXX\u2019s recruitment to SREBP-bound chromatin sites. Further studies will be needed to determine the roles of SREBP SUMOylation in DAXX-mediated activation of lipogenic transcription.",
                "Our data demonstrate that DAXX acts to promote SREBP-mediated transcription. It has been well documented that DAXX can activate and repress transcription, depending on coregulators that are associated with DAXX25. Epigenetic modifiers such as HDACs and DNA and histone methyltransferases are involved in DAXX-mediated transcription repression, while coactivators (e.g., CBP) are involved in DAXX-mediated gene activation. The H3.3 histone chaperone function of DAXX is also implicated in both transcriptional activation67,68 and repression69,70. Independently of H3.3 deposition by DAXX to chromatin, the H3.3/H4 dimer metabolically stabilizes DAXX protein, which indirectly enhances repression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) by a complex consisting of the DAXX-H3.3/H4 sub-complex, HDAC1, KAP1, and SETDB146. Our data show that SREBP1/2 bind to DAXX by contacting both 4HB and HBD (Fig.\u00a02). A previous structural study demonstrates that a peptide within the transactivation domain of p53 binds to DAXX 4HB51. It will be interesting to assess whether DAXX also engages the transactivation domain of SREBPs to promote transcription and whether the H3.3 chaperone function of DAXX is important for lipogenic gene expression.",
                "Of note, the binding motifs of other known DAXX-binding transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB27 were significantly enriched in DAXX ChIP-seq peaks (Fig.\u00a04e). Our data also implicate the chromatin recruitment of DAXX by other transcription factors such as RUNX1, RUNX2, HIC1 and c-MYC that were not previously shown to interact with DAXX (Fig.\u00a04e and Supplementary Fig. S9). Furthermore, DAXX might interact with the core-transcriptional machinery, as the TATA-box and DCE (downstream core element) were enriched in DAXX-binding chromatins (Fig.\u00a04e and Supplementary Fig. S9). These observations suggest a broader role for DAXX in transcription regulation.",
                "DAXX appears to interact with SREBP1/2 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig.\u00a02). In the nucleus, the DAXX\u2013SREBP interactions are expected to mediate DAXX\u2019s chromatin recruitment and the activation of lipogenic gene expression. The functional effects of DAXX\u2013SREBP interactions in the cytoplasm are currently unknown. In the cytoplasm, DAXX has been shown to interact with regulators of cell death and cell survival25. A recent study demonstrates that DAXX promotes the formation of SQSTM1/p62 membrane-less liquid compartments to activate cellular anti-oxidative stress response71. Interestingly, the number of DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 PLA complexes increases upon serum starvation (Fig.\u00a02c), suggesting that a low level of lipid supply may trigger the formation of the DAXX\u2013SREBP1/2 complexes in the cytoplasm. Of note, our data show that the full-length SREBP1/2 were detectable in the nuclear fraction (Supplementary Fig. S5a, b). In earlier studies, the full-length SREBP1/2 were found in purified nuclear extracts and nuclear membranes9 and appear diffusely throughout the cell including the nucleus15. In agreement with these early observations, our data show that SREBP1 are found diffusely in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S7). Whereas these data suggest that SREBPs might not be restricted in the ER and Golgi membranes in the cytoplasm, in some cells, higher levels of SREBP1 were seen in perinuclear areas, reminiscent of ER membrane localization (denoted with yellow arrows in Supplementary Fig. S7a, top). Therefore, the DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction as detected by PLA might not just occur on ER (Fig.\u00a02c). In the absence of serum, SREBP1 is markedly enriched in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S7b, c). Nonetheless, the determination of precise localization of SREBPs in cytoplasmic structures in addition to ER and Golgi will require biochemical fractionation of various compartments and high-resolution imaging methods such as electron microscopy. Notably, mature SREBPs were found predominantly in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S5a, b). Therefore, the cytoplasmic SREBPs are largely SREBP precursors. Our data show that DAXX interacts with both precursor and mature SREBPs. Interestingly, DAXX seems to promote SREBP1 nuclear localization (Supplementary Fig. S7a), and DAXX OE increased the protein levels of mature SREBP1 (Supplementary Fig. S7d). These observations raise an intriguing possibility that the DAXX\u2013SREBP interaction might facilitate SREBP maturation and nuclear translocation of mature SREBPs. Interestingly, mTORC1 inhibition appears to result in a Lipin-1-mediated sequestration of mature SREBPs in nuclear periphery and a subnuclear compartment inaccessible to DNA in NIH3T3 cells15. It will be interesting to assess whether DAXX could prevent such sequestration to facilitate SREBPs to bind chromatin. The functional ramification of the interaction between DAXX and full-length precursor SREBPs requires further investigation.",
                "Epidemiological studies suggest beneficial effects of statin use for lowering BC risk for ER-positive (ER\u2009+) and ER-negative BC subtypes72\u201377. In vitro, ER-negative and basal-like BC cell lines appear more sensitive to statins than ER\u2009+\u2009BC cell lines78,79. However, whether statin use would benefit patients with specific BC subtypes remains to be established. Significantly, acquired resistance to endocrine therapies in ER\u2009+\u2009BCs is associated with increased cholesterol production80,81. In particular, elevated expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis (e.g., SQLE) is associated with poor response to aromatase inhibitors in clinical samples80. Statins were shown to reduce ER\u03b1 chromatin binding and invasive growth of ER\u2009+\u2009BC cells81. Our data show that DAXX promotes lipid production in different cancer types in vitro and in vivo. Concordantly, SIM2 was effective to inhibit de novo lipogenesis in ER\u2009+\u2009BC and TNBC cell lines and effectively inhibited in vivo tumor growth of basal/TNBC tumor models (Fig.\u00a08 and Supplementary Fig. S12). It will be interesting to test whether DAXX is involved in promoting cholesterol synthesis associated with treatment resistance, and whether DAXX inhibition using agents such as SIM2 could sensitize treatment response to statins."

The T47D cell line was cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologics, Atlanta, GA), penicillin (10 units/ml), and streptomycin (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml). To culture cells in serum starvation condition, the serum-containing medium was removed from cell cultures after overnight incubation and the culture was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, without calcium and magnesium, Corning). Cells were then cultured in serum-free DMEM. For culturing cells in suspension (3D culture), plates were coated with a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) and complete DMEM medium. A desirable number of cells were suspended in the Matrigel and medium mixture and layered on the top of the solidified Matrigel. Complete DMEM medium was added after the Matrigel was solidified. Medium was replaced with fresh complete medium every three days. Colonies were imaged under a microscope; colony numbers and sizes were quantified. Human cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, Hs578t, MCF7, T47D, HCT116, PC-3, and 293T) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). R1-AD1 is a subline of the PCa cell line CWR-R1, and R1-D567 is an engineered derivative line\u00a0of R1-AD1 that expresses C-terminally truncated AR (AR-Vs)82. R1-AD1 and R1-D567 were provided by Dr. Scott Dehm, University of Minnesota. The mouse cancer cell lines 4T1, CT26.CL25, and TRAMP-C2 were from ATCC.

MZmine 2.15 (freeware) was used for mass detection with mass detector centroid noise set at 1.0E5 using only MS level 1 data; chromatogram building and deconvolution were then applied (m/z tolerance, 0.005 or 10 ppm; retention time tolerance, 0.2\u2009min; minimum time span, 0.1\u2009min; and minimum height, 5.0E5) followed by isotope grouping, alignment (m/z tolerance, 0.005 or 10 ppm; retention time tolerance, 0.2\u2009min), and gap filling (m/z tolerance, 0.005 or 10 ppm; retention time tolerance, 0.2\u2009min, and intensity tolerance 25%). MZmine-based online metabolite search engine KEGG, MMCD database, XCMS online database, Metaboanalyst 3.0, R program, and internal retention time library were used for the identification and analysis of metabolites."

Female NSG (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice, between the ages of 4\u201312 weeks, were injected subcutaneously in a mammary fat-pad area with one million cells in 100\u2009\u00b5l of complete DMEM (MDA-MB-231-derived cell lines) or in a suspension of 50\u2009\u00b5l of Matrigel and 50\u2009\u00b5l of cell suspension (MDA-MB-468-derived cell lines). The prostate cancer R1-AD1-derived cells (Matrigel suspension) and the colon cancer HCT116-derived cells (medium suspension) were injected subcutaneously in a flank of male NSG mice (the R1-AD1 model) or that of both female and male NSG mice (the HCT116 model). For syngeneic 4T1 and E0771 breast cancer models, female BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were used, respectively. For the syngeneic prostate cancer TRAMP-C2 model, male NSG mice were used. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor dimensions using a digital caliper once a week until endpoint. Tumor volume was calculated with the formula \u00bd\u2009\u00d7\u2009length\u2009\u00d7\u2009width2. At the endpoint, mice were euthanized, tumors were excised, weighed, and photographed. During experiments, any tumor-bearing mice with tumor size >1.5\u2009cm, tumor ulceration, and a body condition score \u22642 were euthanized. Euthanasia was done using the carbon dioxide inhalation method.",
                        "For the in vivo SIM2 treatment study, MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors were established as above and the mouse mammary tumor cell line 4T1 syngeneic tumors were established by transplanting one million cells in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMEM into mammary fat pads of female BALB/c mice. When tumors grew to a palpable size, tumor-bearing mice were randomized into vehicle and SIM2 treatment arms, so that each group has similar distributions of tumor volumes. The vehicle consisted of 33% (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPBCD, RND Center Inc., La Jolla) in PBS and 45% polyethylene glycol 400 (Alfa Aesar, Tewksbury, MA), which was filtered through a 0.22\u2009\u00b5m filter. The SIM2 peptide was formulated at 5\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 in the vehicle. Tumor-bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100\u2009\u00b5l of vehicle or the formulated SIM2 peptide once daily every weekday until a predefined endpoint. During the treatment, tumor dimensions and mouse body weights were recorded once weekly. At the endpoint, tumors were excised, weights and photographed. Tumors were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Tumor lysates were prepared for immunoblotting analysis. Animal use has been approved for this project by the University of Florida IACUC."

Briefly, at about 90% confluency, the cells were crosslinked by adding 37% formaldehyde to the final concentration of 1% for 10\u2009min at room temperature. Crosslinking was stopped by adding glycine to the final concentration of 125\u2009mM. Cells were lifted, washed with cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in a swelling buffer in the presence of the protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore-Sigma\u00a0P8340) and then pelleted and resuspended in the SDS lysis buffer. The lysates were transferred to a Covaris microTUBE and sonicated with an E220 Covaris Ultrasonicator. Chromatin fragmentation (~500\u2009bps) was verified through agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragmented chromatins were diluted and incubated with a control IgG and the DAXX mAb (5G11) along with protein A/G magnetic beads. The beads were washed sequentially with a low salt buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and TE buffer (twice). The immunoprecipitated chromatins were eluted at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min, and the eluted chromatins were subjected to proteinase K digestion at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. The DNAs were recovered through a Qiagen mini-prep column. The immunoprecipitated DNAs were used for qPCR and library construction and high throughput sequencing using an Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 sequencer."

The TCGA gene expression correlation analysis was conducted using GEPIA (gene expression profiling interactive analysis) portal (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of TNBC patients based on the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were analyzed as previously described90. Briefly, TNBC patients were grouped into high (red) and low (blue) mRNA expression of DAXX along with a panel of selected lipogenic genes (TCGA) or DAXX mRNA levels alone (METABRIC). Kaplan-Meier analysis based on microarray data of the DAXX mRNA expression and recurrence-free survival (RFS) with the \u201cbest cutoff\u201d option was conducted at the kmplot.com portal. For Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), differentially expressed genes (fold-change over \u00b11.3 and P value\u2009<\u20090.05) were used (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen Bioinformatics, http://www.ingenuity.com). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the Java desktop software (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp)88. The GSEA tool was used in pre-ranked mode with all default parameters. For RNA-seq data analysis, we used an established RNA-seq data analysis pipeline91. Briefly, fastq files were aligned to Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38) using HISAT2 (version 2.2.1-3n)92; the transcripts assembling was performed using StringTie (version v1.3.4)93 with RefSeq as transcripts ID; and the normalized counts (by FPKM) was called using Ballgown (version v2.12.0)94. The differential expression analysis was performed using R package limma (edgeR version 3.38.4)95; and the pathway enrichment analysis was performed using IPA. ChIP-seq sequencing reads (Fastq files) were mapped to the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) using Bowtie296, where option \u2013local was specified to trim or clip unaligned reads from one or both ends of the alignment. Genome browser BedGraph tracks and read density histograms were generated using SeqMINER. Peak finding and annotation to the nearest Refseq gene promoter were performed and de novo motif discovery was carried out using HOMER97."
