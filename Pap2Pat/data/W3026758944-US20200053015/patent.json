                        "Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is an approach designed to deliver a message between neighboring nodes in a store-carry-forward way in an environment where connectivity between a source node and a destination node is not guaranteed. In DTN, each node stores a message to transmit, and can forward the message to other nodes according to a preset condition when it encounters another node.",
                        "DTN attracts a lot of attention because it can overcome disconnection through opportunistic transmission between encountered neighboring nodes in an extreme environment where the communication infrastructure is destroyed by a disaster, such as earthquakes, floods and fires, and there is no stable routing path to connect many nodes due to low node density.",
                        "Meanwhile, the Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a communication approach based on a data name rather than an IP address. Currently, there are rapid increases in Internet usage in terms of the number of users and data capacity. According to the current IP address-based data transmission method, transmission is carried out using a receiver's IP address related to the physical location, and accordingly the same data is repeatedly transmitted through the network. Therefore, the current data transmission method is inefficient.",
                        "ICN is technology proposed to overcome a traffic bottleneck phenomenon which is a disadvantage of the conventional IP address-based communication method, and the ICN enables routers or nodes to store and distribute specified data to neighboring routers or nodes that request the corresponding data. In ICN, a message may be classified either into Interest and Data. A consumer or data requester that needs Data can disseminate Interest through the network. When receiving the Interest, a router, node or data provider that has the requested Data may deliver the Data to the consumer or data requester back through the same path from which the Interest delivered.",
                        "ICN is designed based on a network environment where connectivity is guaranteed, and enforces a caching policy based on various network information collected in the network environment.",
                        "However, because DTN where connectivity between nodes is not guaranteed has limited buffer capacity, when ICN is applied to DTN, it is impossible to apply the conventional caching policy as it is.",
                        "Additionally, multiple nodes may request the same data in ICN, and in view of this, there is a need for a new caching policy."
