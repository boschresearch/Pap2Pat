    "title": "Development of a porcine model of phenylketonuria with a humanized R408W mutation for gene editing",
    "date": "2021-01-25",
    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder whereby phenylalanine metabolism is deficient due to allelic variations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ). There is no cure for PKU other than orthotopic liver transplantation, and the standard of care for patients is limited to dietary restrictions and key amino acid supplementation. Therefore, Pah was edited in pig fibroblasts for the generation of PKU clone piglets that harbor a common and severe human mutation, R408W. Additionally, the proximal region to the mutation was further humanized by introducing 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to allow for development of gene editing machinery that could be translated directly from the pig model to human PKU patients that harbor at least one classic R408W allele. Resulting piglets were hypopigmented (a single Ossabaw piglet) and had low birthweight (all piglets). The piglets had similar levels of PAH expression, but no detectable enzymatic activity, consistent with the human phenotype. The piglets were fragile and required extensive neonatal care to prevent failure to thrive and early demise. Phenylalanine levels rose sharply when dietary Phe was unrestricted but could be rapidly reduced with a low Phe diet. Fibroblasts isolated from R408W piglets show susceptibility to correction using CRISPR or TALEN, with subsequent homology-directed recombination to correct Pah . This pig model of PKU provides a powerful new tool for development of all classes of therapeutic candidates to treat or cure PKU, as well as unique value for proof-of-concept studies for in vivo human gene editing platforms in the context of this humanized PKU allele.",

                "Phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM 262600) is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism of the liver, affecting approximately 1 in every 10,000\u201314,000 live births [1, 2]. Typically, PKU is the result of genetic mutations causing deficiencies in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine [3]. Untreated, PKU causes severe behavioral problems and neurocognitive impairment [4]. Contemporary therapy involves dietary phenylalanine restriction for all patients, along with oral administration of tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor for patients with partial-activity PAH alleles [5]. Enzyme substitution therapy or orthotopic liver transplantation are expensive options with lifelong implications. However, there is currently no true cure for PKU short of liver transplantation.",
                "PKU is recessive, and many patients are compound heterozygous for two different variants at the PAH locus, demonstrating a spectrum of severity resulting from partial to complete loss of PAH activity [6]. There is a high degree of variation between PAH activity levels based on the exact PAH alleles present [7]. Although PKU is phenotypically complex [4] most patients typically assume a metabolic phenotype dictated by the less-severe allele. Functional correction of the mutant PAH gene, or transgene expression of wild type PAH in a sufficient number of hepatocytes could cure PKU for many patients [8], and correction of only one allele is required to cure any specific hepatocyte. The number of corrected hepatocytes that would be required to cure a patient is estimated to be at least 10%, based on severity of alleles present [9, 10]. This relatively low target makes PKU an interesting indication for gene therapy, but there are still many challenges to developing these advanced approaches [11].",
                "PKU researchers have benefitted by the availability of useful mouse models for decades [12], but there were no clinically-relevant large-animal models. Therefore, we chose to create an R408W pig model of PKU, selecting this common and severe disease allele that results in complete ablation of PAH activity [7, 13, 14] and is present in 40% [15] to 70% [14, 16] of patients depending on nationality. In creating this model, we humanized 5 SNPs around the R408W locus (hR408W), as this genotype is often inherited with these SNPs [13]. Such a pig should be 1) a relevant model of the human disease arising from null-activity PAH expression, 2) genetically consistent to breed or clone due to lack of heterogeneity at this locus, and 3) definitive in the preclinical evaluation of any potential therapeutic approaches for PKU.",
                "Developmental studies in a pig model with any two generally-null alleles could be translated directly to patients for non allele-specific treatments of PKU, such as oral administration of supplements, probiotics, dietary control of circulating phenylalanine, and gene delivery of PAH or phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). However, differences in the target sequence that would be apparent in varied null alleles, or those species-specific differences between model and human could render many investigational gene editing reagents for humans ineffective in a pig model. By electing to not only create the pathogenic human amino acid substitution R408W in these pigs, but also to humanize the nearby polymorphisms, the PahhR408W/hR408W pig has 48 contiguous base pairs that fully represent the human disease allele (hR408W). CRISPRs, TALENs, prime editor, or other gene therapy platforms that rely on sequence identity within target regions could be developed in this model, and results would be directly translatable to human patients harboring at least one R408W allele without the need to develop expensive species-specific models to test safety or efficacy.",
                "Here we show the development of this novel PahhR408W/hR408W PKU pig model, including phenotypic characterization. We anticipate that this porcine PKU model will expedite development of advanced therapies for PKU and could also serve as a platform for demonstrating general safety and utility of other exploratory gene editing platforms in the context of a human allelic target."

            "paragraphs": [
                "To create the model, we used TALENs targeted to exon 8 of the PAH allele in pig fibroblasts (Fig 1a) and a single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) homology template to include the R408W mutation as well as incorporate the 5 human SNPs (Fig 1b). Early passage fetal fibroblasts from an Ossabaw minipig or Yorkshire (large-white conventional pigs) were transfected, subcloned, and screened by Sanger sequencing to identify clones that harbored the desired allele. Positive clones were pooled and used as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to create founder piglets. Five total pregnancies resulted in ten live born piglets. Since these animals were cloned (not bred) they were all homozygous PAH-targeted (PKU) animals, all harboring at least one hR408W allele (Table 1). An eleventh piglet died of complications during the delivery procedures unrelated to the PKU phenotype. No effects of Pah targeting were evident on litter size, as the total number of offspring was consistent with historical averages for cloned piglets [17].",
                "The initial Ossabaw piglet from Pregnancy A (Fig 1c, middle left panel) was slightly below average weight (Fig 1d, 464 g vs 650 g) and demonstrated marked hypopigmentation compared to wild type Ossabaw piglets (Fig 1c, left panel), characteristic of disrupted phenylalanine metabolism. Plasma from cord blood showed elevated phenylalanine at birth (247 \u03bcM compared to 70 \u03bcM for the wild type sow). The piglet was fed unmodified colostrum replacer for the first 24 hours, at which point, neurological dysfunction developed, manifesting as lethargy, poor feeding, and ataxia. A peripheral blood sample taken at 24 hours showed a rise in plasma phenylalanine to 937 \u03bcM. Treatment with 20 kcal/oz Phenex-1 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), a modified amino acid/low-phenylalanine milk replacer used for human PKU patients, was initiated at 24 hours after birth. Within the next 6 hours the piglet showed increased activity levels and normalization of neurologic function. Treatment with Phenex-1 continued until 80 hours old, when the piglet developed scours (possibly related to dietary transitions) and ultimately failed to thrive. Post mortem plasma analysis showed phenylalanine levels had dropped to 150 \u03bcM, suggesting that treatment with Phenex-1 had been able to normalize blood phenylalanine.",
                "Subsequent SCNT efforts transitioned to the Yorkshire background, a commonly cloned breed that is not predisposed to metabolic abnormalities that are observed in the Ossabaw background [18, 19]. This resulted in 9 live piglets from 4 pregnancies (4, 1, 2, and 2 piglets, respectively, Table 1). The four piglets from Pregnancy B (Fig 1c, middle right panel) were approximately 75% of historical wild type body weight (Fig 1d), but were otherwise phenotypically unremarkable at birth. Piglets 1795 and 1796 were robust at birth and independently fed well on colostrum replacer until 36 hours, at which point, severe neurological dysfunction (pedaling, ataxia, epilepsy) was observed and both piglets succumbed to lethal seizures around 40 hours of age. It was unknown if the seizures were related to the metabolic phenotype or possible dehydration from nutritional diarrhea. Piglet 1794, similar to 1769, started showing neurological symptoms (ataxia, lethargy, walking in circles) after consuming colostrum replacer for 24 hours. Treatment with Phenex-1 ameliorated neurological symptoms within four hours, further validating the fidelity of this model to the human disease phenotype, but nutritional diarrhea ultimately led to the death of this piglet around 100 hours of age. Piglet 1797 consumed colostrum replacer for the first 24 hours before treatment with Phenex-1 began. This piglet never fed well independently and ultimately died due to complications of failure to thrive. Post mortem plasma analysis showed moderately elevated phenylalanine in Piglet Nos. 1794\u20131797 of 349, 341, 274, and 477 \u03bcM, respectively.",
                "Pregnancy C resulted in a single live piglet (No. 1798). This animal had the expected elevated cord blood phenylalanine at 345 \u03bcM. With the hypothesis that earlier treatment with Phenex-1 would prevent the onset of neurologic dysfunction and reduce the occurrence of nutritional diarrhea present in the previous litters, Piglet No. 1798 was fed a mixture of colostrum replacer and Phenex-1 at a ratio of 9:1 for the first six hours of life, 3:1 for hours six through 18, 1:1 for hours 18 through 24, and Phenex-1 alone from 24 hours on. No neurological dysfunction was observed, but the onset of mild diarrhea began around 24 hours of age and progressively worsened despite intraperitoneal fluid therapy and treatment with antibiotics. Ultimately, death occurred around 105 hours. Interestingly, post mortem plasma phenylalanine was within normal limits at 133 \u03bcM, suggesting 1) early treatment with Phenex-1 was able to normalize blood phenylalanine and 2) the lethality observed through this pregnancy was not likely related to the phenotype of hyperphenylalaninemia.",
                "For Pregnancies D and E, the sows were maintained on 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC, the drug used to treat tyorisinemia type 1) at a daily dose of 25 mg to inhibit tyrosine metabolism, with the hypothesis that any gestational effect of PAH-targeting could cause hypotyrosinemia [20] from lack of PAH activity. Therefore, this pharmacological prevention of metabolism of residual tyrosine may help support proper early development. These four piglets, (two animals shown in Fig 1c, right panel) were phenotypically unremarkable at birth, with body weights from 1120 to 1630 grams (Fig 1d, hR408W NTBC), statistically higher than untreated hR408W counterparts, and had phenylalanine levels of 97 to 214 \u03bcM (Fig 3a). Surviving piglets in Pregnancies D and E were compound heterozygotes featuring one fully targeted hR408W allele, as well as a second PAH-null allele variety. In Pregnancy D this was a frame-shifted indel that introduced a stop codon 47 amino acids downstream (PAHhR408W/A403GfsX47, Fig 2). In Pregnancy E this was a partially humanized R408W, where the first two 5\u2019 SNPs were not humanized (PAHhR408W/R408W). One piglet from each litter (22 and 900, subsequently named Charm and Cheerio) had a similar demise as previous litters and died on day 6 of life, but another piglet from each litter (23 and 899, subsequently named Lucky and Cornflake) survived the neonatal period and were maintained for chronic phenotypic characterization. These piglets all showed elevated tyrosine at birth due to gestational NTBC administration (Fig 3a), which declined to normal levels after birth since the piglets were not maintained on NTBC (Fig 3b) post-delivery.",
                "Diet for Lucky and Charm was modified dynamically during the neonatal period, aimed at addressing transient diarrhea while also providing sufficient nutrition in the context of metabolic disease (Fig 3b and 3c, green line, left panels). This regiment consisted of colostrum (200 mls each) for the first 7 hours, Phenex-1 starting at hour 8 until day 3, 50% Phenex-1/50% Birthright milk replacer on days 3\u20136, and 100% Birthright milk replacer from day 6 until week 3 of life. Lucky showed increasing phenylalanine levels until dietary phenylalanine intake was restricted at 3 weeks of age, and the diet was continually modified thereafter to target phenylalanine levels of 100\u2013300 \u03bcM. Diet for Cornflake and Cheerio was not modified, and both piglets received normal colostrum replacer for up to 48 hours, pig milk replacer until weaned, and then normal feed (Fig 3b and 3c, green line, right panels). Cornflake showed chronically elevated phenylalanine levels, with fluctuations likely related to growth needs and proximity of blood collections with food consumption. On Day 80 we reduced dietary phenylalanine in Cornflake due to severe neuromotor ataxia resulting in abrasions to the lower extremities. Good association was shown between dietary phenylalanine intake and circulating phenylalanine levels in both Lucky and Cornflake (Fig 3c) consistent with absent PAH activity and consequences of the human PKU phenotype despite the slight variations in the compound heterozygous genotype. Analysis of serum alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations from Lucky and Cornflake indicated overall good liver health in the long-term piglets (Fig 3d). However, during treatment for the ataxia complications with wound care led to euthanasia for humane purposes.",
                "Post mortem analyses of the piglets that did not survive past 7 days showed negligible PAH enzymatic activity compared to wild type, falling below the level of detection for all PAH-targeted piglets tested (Fig 3e). This radiometric assay can reliably detect phenylalanine conversion down 1% of the rate in wild type liver. This result is similar to that expected for the human phenotype, where the R408W mutation achieves complete ablation of PAH activity despite seemingly unaltered levels of expression via immunofluoroscopy (S1 Fig).",
                "Amino acid analysis of lysates of brain cortex from PAHhR408W/hR408W piglets and from wild type controls (Table 2) showed higher levels of phenylalanine in the brain of PAHhR408W/hR408W piglets, similar to the pattern present in wildtype and Pahenu2/enu2 mice and demonstrating the expected correlation with blood phenylalanine concentrations. Additionally, PAHhR408W/hR408W piglets that consumed colostrum replacer alone had higher levels of both blood and brain phenylalanine than piglets that were fed Phenex-1, further demonstrating the translatability of this model to the human disease. Measurement of monoamine neurotransmitters was attempted retrospectively on postmortem cerebral cortex samples from Piglet Nos. (1794, 1795, 1796, 1797, and 1798 (S1 Table). Although monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency is expected in hyperphenylalaninemic animal models [21], interpretation of the data from these initial animals is limited due to 1) post mortem collections of cerebral cortex at indeterminate intervals as the animals died or were euthanized, and 2) lack of contemporaneous wild type control samples collected under similar conditions. Future evaluations will include prospective and specific collection of substantia nigra and/or basal ganglia where the concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters would be expected to be greater than in cerebral cortex. In general, the mean concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, and 5-HIAA were greater in piglets treated with low Phe diet than in animals that died while consuming only colostrum replacer, suggesting that lowering blood phenylalanine was associated with improved brain monoamine neurotransmitter status; however, the variability described above preclude definitive interpretation of this endpoint.",
                "Histologically, there were no variations in liver morphology (H&E), fibrosis (Masson\u2019s trichrome), or PAH expression patterns (IHC) in Pah-targeted or wild type livers of mice or pigs (Fig 4). Again, this is consistent with the human phenotype where PKU is not associated with pathology in the liver, and PAH expression is largely unaltered between WT and PKU alleles.",
                "The utility of this PKU model is enhanced by the ability to preclinically develop sequence-specific gene editing tools capable of being directly translated to human patients, including those with a classic R408W allele. To that end, a homology template (HT) to correct hR408W (Fig 5a) and associated Cas9 guides were designed to repair the mutant allele as proof of concept toward developing a potential therapeutic gene editing approach. Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) containing the R408W-targeting guide RNA were transfected into hR408W fibroblasts and assayed by T7 endonuclease for the introduction of indels. These RNPs induced indel formation at the PAH locus (Fig 5b and 5c), while analysis of the top 12 predicted off-target gRNA binding sites showed no substantial evidence of cutting by T7 (not shown) or amplicon sequencing relative to variation present in untreated controls (Fig 5c). The top 10 disruptions at PAH relative to the R408W mutation mostly included deletions of 1\u201314 bp (S2 Table). The unedited sequence was only the second most prevalent detected, indicating very efficient cutting and indel formation.",
                "With this verification of the specificity of indel formation, RNPs and a single-stranded homology template (ssODN) were co-transfected into the same fibroblasts. The HT was further engineered to delete the PAM to prevent re-cutting and introduce a silent RFLP that would allow for efficient identification of HDR events (Fig 5a). HDR was confirmed at the population level by the presence of the RFLP in experimental samples (Fig 5d). Additionally, PCR designed using a 3\u2019 primer specific for the HDR event (and a 5\u2019 primer outside of the ssODN) amplified the target product in co-transfected cells, further indicating HDR had occurred (Fig 5e). While R408W was the primary sequence present in untreated fibroblasts, RNPs caused 50% reduction of the presence of the R408W sequence in amplicons sequenced from cells treated with or without ssODN (Fig 5f). Deep sequencing of the resulting amplicon showed disruption at 43% of the products present, with 5% being HDR and 38% NHEJ (Fig 5g). Together, these data indicate the efficacy of these RNPs to initiate HDR to correct R408W in humanized sequences in these fibroblasts.",
                "The PAH-targeted piglets are fragile in the neonatal period. The fragility is difficult to completely ascribe to the PKU phenotype and maybe related to first generation clones seen in other pig models of human diseases [22, 23]. Therefore, since hyperphenylalaninemia is not acutely toxic in human patients, the emphasis in rearing was shifted from attenuating circulating phenylalanine levels to simply maintaining neonatal piglet health. Like patients, PAHhR408W/hR408W pigs express mutant PAH similar to wild type protein levels in healthy pigs, and the protein product cannot metabolize phenylalanine. Expression of the mutant protein is useful to model unanticipated effects of this expression in experimental disease and therapy studies, but it also reduces the potential for immunogenicity against expression of a PAH transgene or the protein product of an edited PAH locus. In the case of R408W, function is eliminated by the substitution of a single amino acid in the transcript, which represents less than 0.3% variation relative to the wild type protein. This theoretical attenuation of immunogenicity would be anticipated to benefit enzyme replacement therapy as well as gene therapy approaches.",
                "Although the utility of this animal to model PKU is valuable for basic research, a broader application of this animal model is the ability to show proof-of-concept for human gene editing platforms, regardless of the target indication. Human therapeutic gene editing in this pig is limited to the context of PKU, but the animal can serve as a model for testing multiple gene therapy platforms at this humanized locus. Indeed, this model can be used to assess safety and efficacy of delivery platforms, such as viral or nanoparticle systems, or the effectiveness of different editing platforms, either in vitro or ex vivo. This generalized use of the model will be useful for translating a variety of gene therapy investigational drugs into the clinic.",
                "To our knowledge, this is the first large animal model to both mimic the disease phenotype, but also model the precise local genotype of a common disease allele. As with most rare genetic diseases, there is no available clinical cure, and current treatments only address the symptoms or themselves reduce the quality of life. Gene therapies, particularly somatic cell gene editing therapies, for many of these diseases represent a viable path to a cure. The ability to engineer allele-specific, and even patient-specific, mutations in large animal models will accelerate the development and improve the chances of success in clinical trials."
