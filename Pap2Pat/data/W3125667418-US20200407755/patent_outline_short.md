# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce PKU

## SUMMARY

- summarize genetic mutation introduction

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe genetic mutation introduction
- describe targeted nuclease system
- describe homology-directed repair template
- describe vector and cell production

### Definitions

- define key terms

### Method Overview

- outline method of introducing gene mutation

### Materials and Methods

- select animal and gene
- design nuclease system
- design HDR template and introduce into cells

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

- introduce PKU disease
- design TALENs and repair sequences
- produce TALENs
- transfect TALENs and HDR oligo into pig fibroblasts
- analyze TALEN efficiency
- isolate and clone piglets with R408W mutation
- characterize piglets' metabolic phenotype
- perform biochemical analyses
- analyze PAH expression and activity
- design homology template for gene editing

## DISCUSSION

- describe animal model of phenylketonuria
