                        "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common of the inborn errors of metabolism of the liver, affecting approximately 1 in every 16,000 live births. Typically it is the result of deficiencies in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, arising from genetic mutation. Untreated, PKU causes behavioral problems, neurocognitive impairment, and can eventually become irreversible and progress to seizures.",
                        "Therapy involves restricting dietary phenylalanine and/or administering cofactors for PAH (such as tetra hydrobiopterin in the case of partial-activity alleles). Enzyme replacement therapy or orthoptopic liver transplantation are expensive options with lifelong implications that are often not necessary for typical patients. However, there is currently no cure for PKU.",
                        "Large animal models can be used to study inborn metabolic disorders such as PKU by introducing genetic mutations into the DNA of the animals to mimic the disorder. Gene editing techniques can be tested on such animal models by modifying the gene editing system to target the sequences found in that particular animal. However, these modifications make it more difficult to accurately test techniques that will be used to treat humans."

Nuclei from cells containing these DNA sequences can be used to create transgenic embryos which can be implanted into an adult female animal for gestation. Animals produced by these methods can be used to model human diseases associated with mutated genes. The models are useful for testing human gene therapies because the flanking sequences surrounding the gene of interest match the sequences of human DNA, thus enabling direct testing of gene therapies designed for human subjects in the animal model.",

Those diseases that result from mutations in genes that exist at birth can be referred to as \u201cinborn errors of metabolism,\u201d \u201ccongenital metabolic diseases,\u201d or \u201cinherited metabolic disorders.\u201d Examples of inborn errors of metabolism include adrenoleukodystrophy, Gaucher disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Maple syrup urine disease, Glucose galactose malabsorption disease, Menkes syndrome, Niemann-Pick disease, phenylketonuria, Refsum disease, Tangier disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Wilson's disease, Zellweger syndrome, Alkaptonuria, Carnosinemia, Cystinuria, fumaric aciduria, Tyrosinemia, Sarcosinemia, Hyperlysinemia, and Hyperprolinemia. In some embodiments, the inborn error of metabolism is phenylketonuria (PKU).",
                                "For the disorders where a particular gene has been identified for being linked to the disease phenotype, animals having the equivalent or homologous genetic mutation can serve as useful models for the human disease. Various types of mutations can lead to disruption of enzyme activity, including truncations, deletions, missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and insertions. In some instances, a mutation can be specific to a single nucleotide or amino acid. In some embodiments, the mutation selected for use in an animal model is homologous to a mutation that causes a human metabolic disorder. The location of the homologous nucleotide or amino acid needs to be identified in the model animal. For that reason, it must be confirmed that the model animal has a homologous gene. This can be accomplished using online software tools such as NCBI's HomoloGene database. In some embodiments, the target gene is Pah and the mutation is R408W in exon 8 of the pig genome, which is equivalent to the Pah gene in exon 12 in humans.",
                                "Animals that can serve as models for human diseases can be any vertebrate non-human animal. In some embodiments, the non-human animal is a mammal. The mammal can be selected from ungulates such as swine, bovine, sheep, goats, horses, and deer. In some embodiments, the animal is a pig. Typically the pigs used for research models are domesticated pigs having the species Sus scrofa. Examples of breeds of pigs that can be used in research include Landrace, Large white, Duroc, Gottingen, and Ossabaw.",

The sequence recognizing peptides are selected to target specific locations within a DNA sequence to cleave with a double-stranded break. The targeted nuclease system could utilize zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR associated proteins (Cas).",

In some embodiments, the double-stranded breaks are at least 20 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides, or at least 30 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the target gene mutation. In some embodiments, the double-stranded breaks are no more than 50 nucleotides upstream or downstream of the target gene mutation. The nucleotide sequence encoding the endonuclease system is generated.

In addition to the nucleotides encoding the target mutation, flanking sequences are designed to replace the nucleotides that are cut from the target DNA. The flanking sequences of the non-human animal DNA are compared with the homologous flanking sequences of a human. The flanking sequences in the HDR template are modified with one or more SNPs to match the human flanking sequences. The HDR template thus includes \u201chumanized\u201d sequences that will allow for gene editing systems designed for human treatment to recognize the DNA sequences flanking either sides of the target mutation. These gene editing systems can includes ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas systems that are designed to modify human DNA. The gene editing systems could therefore be tested in the non-human animal without modification because the sequences flanking both sides of the gene mutation are modified to match the human flanking sequences.",

There is no cure for PKU other than orthotopic liver transplantation, and the standard of care for patients is limited to dietary restrictions and key amino acid supplementation. Therefore, Pah was targeted in pig fibroblasts using TALENs, and pigs were subsequently cloned to facilitate research and therapeutic development where the genetic variation is identical to a common and severe human allele, R408W.

Sequence alignment of ssPAH and hsPAH shows the high similarity surrounding the target R408W mutation. 5 sites were identified for mutation with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to \u201chumanize\u201d the sequences surrounding the PAH mutation. FIG. 4 illustrates the homology template sequence (HT) (SEQ IDs 8-9) that was designed to guide repair of the cleaved DNA to include the R408W mutation as well as 5 SNPs that allow for targeting with human-translatable gene editing reagents.

Postmortem plasma analysis showed phenylalanine levels had dropped to 149.8 \u03bcM, suggesting that treatment with Phenex-1 was able to normalize blood phenylalanine.",
                                "Subsequent SCNT efforts were transitioned to the large white/landrace background (Yorkshire), which is heartier, more familiar to the husbandry groups involved, and less metabolically diverse than the Ossabaw background. This resulted in 9 live piglets in 4 pregnancies (4, 1, 2, and 2, respectively).",
                                "The four piglets from the first of these pregnancies (Pregnancy B) were approximately 75% of historical wild type body weight, as shown in FIG. 5. Otherwise the piglets were phenotypically unremarkable at birth. Piglets 1795 and 1796 were robust at birth and independently fed well on colostrum replacer until 36 hours, at which point, severe neurological dysfunction (pedaling, ataxia, epilepsy) was observed and both piglets succumbed to lethal seizures around 40 hours of age. It was unknown if the seizures were related to the metabolic phenotype or possible dehydration from nutritional diarrhea. Piglet 1794, similar to 1769, started showing neurological symptoms (ataxia, lethargy, walking in circles) after consuming colostrum replacer for 24 hours. Treatment with Phenex-1 ameliorated neurological symptoms within four hours, but nutritional diarrhea ultimately led to the death of this piglet around 100 hours of age. Piglet 1797 consumed colostrum replacer for the first 24 hours before treatment with Phenex-1 began. This piglet never fed well independently and ultimately died due to complications of failure to thrive. Post mortem plasma analysis showed elevated phenylalanine in Piglets Nos. 1794-1797 of 349, 341, 274, and 477 \u03bcM, respectively.",
                                "The Pregnancy C resulted in a single live piglet (No. 1798). This animal had the expected elevated cord blood phenylalanine at 345 \u03bcM. With the hypothesis that earlier treatment with Phenex-1 would prevent the onset of neurologic dysfunction and reduce the occurrence of nutritional diarrhea present in the previous litters, Piglet No. 1798 was fed a mixture of colostrum replacer and Phenex-1 at a ratio of 9:1 for the first six hours of life, 3:1 for hours six through 18, 1:1 for hours 18 through 24, and Phenex-1 alone from 24 hours on. No neurological dysfunction was observed, but the onset of mild diarrhea began around 24 hours of age and progressively worsened despite IP fluid therapy and treatment with antibiotics. Ultimately, death occurred around 105 hours. Interestingly, postmortem plasma phenylalanine was within normal limits at 133 \u03bcM, suggesting 1) early treatment with Phenex-1 was able to normalize blood phenylalanine and 2) the lethality observed through this pregnancy was not likely related to the phenotype of hyperphenylalaninemia.",
                                "For pregnancies D and C, the sows were maintained on NTBC (2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione) at a daily dose of 25 mg with the hypothesis that any gestational effect of PAH deficiency could cause hypotyrosinemia, possibly contributing to the underdevelopment of piglets present at birth. By blocking tyrosine metabolism, piglets would be able to better maintain gestational tyrosine levels to ensure availability of this amino acid for in utero growth and development. These PAH KO piglets were analyzed at birth for circulating phenylalanine and tyrosine levels, compared to the sow (assayed at C-section). Wild type tyrosine level is represented for comparison due to the elevated levels present in the sow, as maintained on NTBC.",
                                "The four live piglets resulting from these final pregnancies were phenotypically unremarkable at birth, with body weights from 1120 to 1630 grams (FIG. 5, NTBC), and phenylalanine levels of 97 to 214 \u03bcM (FIG. 6). Surviving piglets in Pregnancies D and E were compound heterozygotes featuring one fully targeted hR408W allele, as well as a second PAH-null allele variety. In Pregnancy D this was a frame-shifted indel that introduced a stop codon 47 amino acids downstream (PAHhR408w/A403Gfsx47) In Pregnancy E this was a partially humanized R408W, where the first two 5\u2032 SNPs were not humanized (PAHhR4408Q/R408W).",
                                "The two live-born piglets were maintained for 6 days (Charm) or continuously (Lucky) to characterize the R408W metabolic phenotype. Serum phenylalanine levels (red) show fluctuation responsive to dietary phenylalanine available (green) in FIG. 8, indicative of disrupted phenylalanine metabolism and modeling the human disease. Tyrosine levels (blue) were elevated at birth due to NTBC administration during gestation, and showed muted responsiveness to phenylalanine levels during development in FIG. 7. The asterisk in the graphs for Lucky represents timing of clinical chemistry analysis in FIG. 9.",
                                "One piglet from each litter (22 and 900, subsequently named Charm and Cheerio) had a similar demise as previous litters and died on day 6 of life, but another piglet from each litter (23 and 899, subsequently named Lucky and Cornflake) survived the neonatal period and were maintained for chronic phenotypic characterization.",
                                "These piglets all showed elevated tyrosine at birth due to gestational NTBC administration (FIG. 6), which declined to normal levels after birth since the piglets were not maintained on NTBC (FIG. 7). Diet was modified dynamically during the neonatal period, aimed at addressing transient diarrhea while also providing sufficient nutrition in the context of metabolic disease. Therefore, both animals were fed sow colostrum (200 ml each) for the first 7 hours, Phenex-1 starting at hour 8 until day 3, 50% Phenex-1/50% Birthright milk replacer on days 3-6, and 100% Birthright milk replacer from day 6 until week 3 of life. Lucky showed increasing Phe levels until dietary Phe intake was restricted at 3 weeks of age, and the diet was continually modified thereafter to target Phe levels of 100-300 \u03bcM. Diet for Cornflake and Cheerio was not modified, and both piglets received normal colostrum replacer for up to 48 hours, pig milk replacer until weaned, and then normal feed. Cornflake showed chronically elevated phenylalanine levels, with fluctuations likely related to growth needs and proximity of blood collections with food consumption. Good association was shown between dietary Phe intake and circulating Phe levels (FIG. 6) consistent with absent PAH activity and consequences of the human PKU phenotype.",
                                "Analysis of liver enzymes indicated overall good liver health in the long-term piglet. FIG. 9 shows the serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in serum of Lucky and Cornflake (gray) at 6 months of age compared to a wild type animal (black). The piglets' ALP and AST levels were below wild type historical control values. However, the analysis showed healthy ALP and AST levels while maintained on a Phe-restricted diet.",

Homogenized liver samples were quantitated via Bradford assay, and 30-ug aliquots were resuspended in a reducing sample buffer, boiled and run on an 8% acrylamide reducing gel. Gels were blotted to PVDF membrane, and probed with PAH R400 polyclonal antibody (Bioworld Technology, #BS3704) at a dilution of 1:500. GAPDH (ThermoFisher #MA5-15738) was used as a loading control at a dilution of 1:50,000. Two secondary antibodies were used: an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Life Technologies #G21234) to bind to the PAH primary, and a goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz #sc-2055) for the GAPDH. Results were visualized on autoradiograph film using enhanced chemiluminenscence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent).",

Briefly, total protein was measured using a bicinchoninic acid procedure (Microprotein Assay; Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA). Liver homogenates isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used as positive controls. PAH activity is indicated by the presence of tyrosine (Tyr), which is the product of hydroxylation by PAH of phenylalanine.",
                                "Indeed, PAH enzymatic activity was below the level of detection for all PAHR408W/R408W piglets tested, confirming that the R408W mutation was able to achieve complete PAH deficiency despite mutant protein expression (FIG. 9). In other words, a loss of function was achieved with the R408W mutation (* p<0.05).",

Additionally, PAHR408W/R408W piglets that consumed colostrum replacer alone had higher levels of brain phenylalanine than piglets that were fed Phenex-1, further demonstrating the translatability of this model to the human disease.",

To that end, a homology template (HT) to correct hR408W (FIG. 11) and associated Cas9 guides were designed to repair the mutant allele as proof of concept toward developing a potential therapeutic gene editing approach. This repair template corresponds to SEQ IDs 14-15 and the humanized pig hR408W allele corresponds to SEQ IDs 12-13. Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) containing the R408W-targeting guide RNA were transfected into hR408W fibroblasts and assayed by T7 endonuclease for the introduction of indels. These RNPs induced indel formation at the PAH locus (FIGS. 12 and 13), while analysis of the top 12 predicted off target gRNA binding sites showed no substantial evidence of cutting by T7 (not shown) or amplicon sequencing relative to variation present in untreated controls (FIG. 4c). The top 10 disruptions at PAH relative to the R408W mutation mostly included deletions of 1-14 bp. The unedited sequence was only the second most prevalent detected, indicating very efficient cutting and indel formation.",
                                "With this verification of the specificity of indel formation, RNPs and a single-stranded homology template (ssODN) were co-transfected into the same fibroblasts. The HT was further engineered to delete the PAM to prevent re-cutting and introduce a silent RFLP that would allow for efficient identification of HDR events (FIG. 11). HDR was confirmed at the population level by the presence of the RFLP in experimental samples (FIG. 14). Additionally, PCR designed using a 3\u2032 primer specific for the HDR event (and a 5\u2032 primer outside of the ssODN) amplified the target product in co-transfected cells, further indicating HDR had occurred (FIG. 15). While R408W was the primary sequence present in untreated fibroblasts, RNPs caused 50% reduction of the presence of the R408W sequence in amplicons sequenced from cells treated with or without ssODN (FIG. 16). Deep sequencing of the resulting amplicon showed disruption at 43% of then products present, with 5% being HDR and 38% 247 NHEJ (FIG. 17). Together, these data indicate the efficacy of these RNPs to initiate HDR to correct R408W in humanized sequences in these fibroblasts."

                        "A large animal model of phenylketonuria was developed with multiple research and drug/gene therapy development applications. This model shows several key similarities with the human disease that make it useful for basic and therapeutic research purposes, such as hyperphenylalaninemia, altered brain amino acid composition, hypopigmentation, and the ability to acutely control circulating Phe levels with dietary Phe restriction. As a general pig model of PKU, this animal is useful for the evaluation of disease progression and behavioral/dietary maintenance of subclinical Phe levels, as well as a useful model for the development of therapeutics for human consideration, including small molecules, enzyme replacement therapies, microbiome manipulations, etc.",
                        "Due to the humanization around the R408W mutation, this animal is a highly translatable model for gene editing for human PKU patients with at least one R408W allele, a prominent and debilitating isoform. Genetic targeting, such as via CRISPR or TALENs, intended for human use can be directly tested on this model without the need for development of disease model surrogates, which have varying relevance to the human product and are inefficient in both added cost and time.",
                        "Another interesting aspect to this model is the expression of PAH similar to wild type protein levels. Not only is this useful to model for any unanticipated effects of this expression in human disease and therapy, but it also reduces the potential for immunogenicity against a Pah transgene or the protein product of an edited Pah locus. In the case of R408W, function is eliminated by the substitution of a single amino acid in the transcript, which represents less than 0.3% variation from the expressed mutant protein. This theoretical attenuation of immunogenicity would be anticipated to benefit enzyme replacement therapy as well as both gene therapy approaches of gene delivery, which would add expression of a similar-yet-functional transgene, and gene editing, which would replace expression of some of the previously mutant translation product with functional PAH.",
                        "These R408W piglets are fragile in the neonatal period, and the fragility is difficult to completely ascribe to the PKU phenotype. Attempts were made in the earlier pregnancies to immediately attenuate circulating phenylalanine levels; however, as more pregnancies were supported the focus was placed entirely on maintaining piglet health since hyperphenylalaninemia is not acutely toxic in human patients, and this pig has characterized to be a high fidelity model of the human disease. This revised approach provided for the acute viability of a single founder. This animal has provided invaluable research materials such as primary PKU cells and data regarding maintenance of targeted circulating phenylalanine levels. Additional pregnancies are being performed to provide sufficient animals for herd breeding and preclinical testing of gene therapy and gene editing approaches.",
                        "Although the utility in PKU is appealing, the broader application of this animal model is the ability to show proof-of-concept for human gene editing platforms. This model can be investigated to demonstrate safety and efficacy of vectors and vehicles intended for human use to deliver human-translatable gene editing machinery in any gene editing platform.",
