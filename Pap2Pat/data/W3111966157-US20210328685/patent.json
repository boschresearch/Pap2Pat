Each defect consists of one or few atomic substitutions, vacancies, or combinations thereof in a semiconducting or insulating solid-state material. The electronic energy structure of the defect consists of at least one non-degenerate ground state and two excited states with orthogonal transition dipole moments from the ground state, where all the states are spatially localized within several angstroms of the defect site and localized in energy within the band gap of the solid-state material. When the defects are electric dipole-coupled by placing them at least several unit cells away from each other such that the localized orbitals of the defects do not hybridize (on the order of 2 to 200 nm), they can be prepared in a symmetric superposition of doubly excited product states. When this state de-excites, an entangled photon pair is emitted. The solid-state material may be 2D (for instance, mono-, few-, or stacked hetero-layers, such as hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides) or 3D (for instance, diamond, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide).",

More generally, any material with a non-zero band gap may be suitable for use as described herein, as may any materials with a bandgap of at least 15 eV. If the desired emission frequency of the photons is higher, then a larger band gap would be required to host the localized defect orbitals. The requirements of the defects themselves within the solid-state host are described elsewhere herein.",

The defects must may be created and selected and excited into the correct state, of which there are nine for a system with two defects that each have the minimum three states (one ground and two excited). Several methods may be used to stochastically create two nearby defects.",

These methods include, but are not limited to: ion implantation that creates defects with low spatial control; epitaxial growth of defects in crystals that involves growing a crystal via, e.g., chemical vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy in the presence of contaminants that form atomic defects; detonation of host material in the presence of defect constituents to create nanocrystals containing defects; high pressure-high temperature in the presence of defect constituents to create, e.g., diamonds with defects. More deterministic methods of creating defects include: scanning tunnel microscopy, a technique that allows for atomic-level imaging of surfaces and can be adapted to create defects on-demand with high spatial control; and high spatial resolution electron microscopy, where the electron beam can knock out atoms and create defects.",

The microscopic physical mechanism, the biexciton decay cascade, underlying their ability to emit entangled photon pairs is different from the defect-based approaches described herein. Semiconductor quantum dots are challenging to synthesize consistently, which affects the efficiency and fidelity of emitted photon pairs, and their integration on-chip is challenging.",

Either option will prepare the dipole-coupled defect pair (shown in FIG. 3) with the appropriate energy structure into the symmetric doubly excited state from which an entangled photon pair can be emitted.",

The binning can occur in either order, so both possibilities are drawn for a microcavity coupled to polarization (or frequency) beam splitters in FIG. 4.",

Semiconductor quantum dots are challenging to synthesize consistently, which affects the efficiency and fidelity of emitted photon pairs, and their integration on-chip is challenging.",
                        "In various embodiments, the dipole-coupled defect system is pumped from the ground state to the symmetric doubly excited state via two-photon absorption, where the light source comprises two lasers, one of which is x-polarized and the other is y-polarized. There are, in fact, two possible pathways from the ground state to the symmetric doubly excited state. In one of the two pathways, the x-polarized laser emits with frequency \u03c9X,1\u2212\u03b4 and the y-polarized laser emits with frequency \u03c9Y,2+\u03b4, where \u03b4 is some frequency detuning and can be negative or positive. In the other pathway, the x-polarized laser emits with frequency \u03c9X,2\u2212\u03b4 and the y-polarized laser emits with frequency \u03c9Y,1+\u03b4. The former pathway corresponds to climbing the left path in FIG. 5C, and the latter pathway corresponds to the right path in FIG. 5C. The lasers are detuned by \u03b4 so that only the symmetric doubly excited state is populated and not any of the intermediate states that would be pumped if \u03b4 were zero.",
                        "The binner in various embodiments spatially separates (bins) the emitted photons by frequency and polarization so that a user of the device knows that if a detector is placed at one of the outputs of the entangled photon pair source and the detector clicks, then a photon of a given polarization and frequency has been detected. The binner need not be separate from the detector. For instance, the detector may be able to resolve frequencies and polarizations itself. The binner has another important functionality (it also acts as a collector), and that is to collect the emitted photons and emit them in a given direction because otherwise, photons will be emitted everywhere. Whether a collecting mechanism and/or a binning mechanism is required depends on the application. In particular, whether the user of the entangled photon pairs would like to separate them by polarization and frequency, and the collection efficiency that the user desires will impact whether a binner is included in a given embodiment.",
                        "In an exemplary chip for quantum computing, there are qubits (quantum memories), mechanisms for implementing quantum gates, and mechanisms for initializing qubits. Some algorithms, such as entanglement swapping that can be used in quantum repeaters, require that the pairs of qubits are initially entangled with each other. This can be implemented by deterministically emitting an entangled photon pair according to the present disclosure, and each of the two qubits to be entangled absorbs one photon of the pair. To ensure efficiency absorption of the photon, the qubits may be coupled to the source via a waveguide, for instance.",
                        "Because achievable dipole splittings are on the order of tens of GHz (gigahertz, or tens of micro electronvolts, or millikelvin), then operating temperatures should be lower than these dipole splittings. These temperatures can be accomplished in dilution fridges, a common environment for defect-based quantum technologies. If defects are placed closer together and/or defects with larger transition dipole moments are used, then it is possible to increase the operating temperature, for example to 4 kelvin corresponding to liquid helium. The limiting factor of high-fidelity emission of entangled photon pairs is the linewidth of the emitted photons, which, for emission into free space, is on the order of 1 micro electronvolt, thus requiring millikelvin temperatures. However, if the linewidth were to be increased by coupling the defect to, say, a bad cavity that increases the emission rate of the photons via the Purcell effect, then higher temperatures may be used.",
                        "The minimum wavelength (maximum frequency) of the emitted photon is limited by how large the band gap is, as the transition frequencies must lie within the band gap. Hexagonal boron nitride, for example, has a band gap of 6 eV, so a defect may emit with up to 6 eV. Defects have been observed to emit from the IR range to the UV range, and so devices according to the present disclosure are able to emit photons within a similar frequency range depending on the exact defect chosen. The minimum frequency is limited by noise and is likely far below what is practically useful. For instance, quantum networking applications require IR/near IR photons that have frequencies substantially higher than thermal noise in dilution fridges and even liquid helium.",
                        "The present disclosure provides a scheme that uses a dipole-coupled emitter pair to deterministically emit polarization-entangled photon pairs. Based on this scheme, spectroscopic signatures are predicted and the entanglement is quantified with realistic material parameters. In addition, it is described how the Bell state fidelity and efficiency can be optimized by precisely tuning transition frequencies. It is discussed how defect emitters are natural candidates for the proposed scheme, offering numerous advantages including flexible on-chip photonic integration and tunable emission properties via external fields, electromagnetic environments, and defect selection.",
                        "Non-classical states of light are important resources for quantum technologies, such as quantum information processing, networking, and metrology. Entangled photon pairs, in particular, have applications in solid-state quantum repeaters, a crucial component of long-distance quantum networking that overcomes transmission loss by leveraging the effects of entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. Despite the diverse applications for such non-classical states of light, methods for generating them deterministically remain limited. Alternative approaches are based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion or spontaneous four-wave mixing with high performance. A major drawback of such methods is that the number of photon pairs generated follows a Poissonian distribution, rendering the pair generation efficiency too low for scalable quantum systems. Semiconductor quantum dots can deterministically emit entangled photon pairs via biexciton decay cascade with high fidelity and emission efficiency. This mechanism, however, requires careful engineering of quantum dots and pumping schemes that poses a technological challenge, motivating the search for alternative pathways to the generation pairs.",
                        "A basis is provided herein for a deterministic entangled photon pair source from a pair of dipole-coupled three-level quantum emitters. Each emitter consists of a ground state and two optically active electronic excited states with mutually orthogonal transition dipole moments. The emergent electronic structure of the composite system then allows for the implementation of a radiative decay cascade from a symmetric doubly excited state of the pair, which results in the emission of two entangled photons of orthogonal polarization. The resulting emission spectra are analyzed to note qualitative signatures of entanglement, especially in the cross-correlation spectrum.",
                        "To better quantify the entanglement of the emitted photon pairs in continuous frequency space, their entanglement entropy S and Bell state fidelity are calculated. Importantly, Bell state fidelity can be optimized at the expense of the entanglement entropy S by tuning the defect transition dipole moments and concentrating the probability density within the states of interest, or the ideal Bell state. In addition, the entanglement measures of the emitted photons are robust to relative differences in frequency between the intermediate states, while the fidelity in the presence of phonon-based dephasing is limited when the dephasing rate is on the order of the radiative rate or higher. A method is also provided of initializing the system with orthogonally-polarized continuous wave lasers that involves two-photon absorption to enable Rabi oscillations between the ground and symmetric doubly excited state of the pair.",
                        "This scheme has the advantage of requiring only emitters with well-understood singly-excited states that could be realized by a variety of physical systems, whereas accurate determination of the energetics of multiply-excited states from first principles remains a challenge. The applicability of defect emitters is discussed, given their fixed geometries enabling stable dipole-coupling, diverse symmetries that allow non-degenerate transitions with orthogonal transition dipole moments, and emission properties that can be tailored via external fields. In addition, the chemical selection space of defect systems is vast. The present scheme is, however, likely amenable to dipole-coupled quantum dots or molecules as well, although they may lack certain advantages of dipole-coupled defect centers. The ability to generate entangled photon pairs from defects would enable on-chip integration with quantum memories and emitters, minimizing the need to transduce photons from source to storage to emission in quantum technologies.",

Specifically, two three-level emitter systems are dipole-coupled, each with excited states with orthogonal transition dipole moments, to form a composite emitter system. When the composite emitter system is excited to a symmetric doubly excited state and subsequently de-excites in a radiative cascade, two entangled photons are emitted. The entanglement measures of the emitted photons are robust to relative differences in frequency between the intermediate states.

A use case that highlights their applicability is the experimental demonstration of memory-enhanced quantum communication for quantum repeaters.",

In addition, the chemical selection space of defect systems is vast, as the chemical identity of the defect and surrounding matrix can be permuted to discover the appropriate system for a specific application. Because accurately computing multiply excited states remains a significant challenge, the present scheme involving just singly excited states is more amenable to computational searches of defect system candidates. A current challenge of realizing defect-based quantum emitters, however, is the relatively low phonon-limited quantum efficiency, the highest of which has been observed to be 87%\u00b17% for single-photon emitters in hBN as compared to theoretical predictions of >96% phonon-limited quantum efficiency in semiconductor quantum dots with realistic experimental parameters. System imperfections of defect-based systems may be modulated by coupling defects to external fields, including electric, magnetic, and strain, as well as to waveguides and sculpted electromagnetic environments of cavities to improve fidelity and collection efficiency.",
