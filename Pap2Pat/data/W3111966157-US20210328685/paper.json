    "abstract": "Scalable quantum systems require deterministic entangled photon pair sources. Here, we demonstrate a scheme that uses a dipole-coupled defect pair to deterministically emit polarization-entangled photon pairs. Based on this scheme, we predict spectroscopic signatures and quantify the entanglement with physically realizable system parameters. We describe how the Bell state fidelity and efficiency can be optimized by precisely tuning transition frequencies. A defect-based entangled photon pair source would offer numerous advantages including flexible on-chip photonic integration and tunable emission properties via external fields, electromagnetic environments, and defect selection.",

                "Nonclassical states of light are important resources for quantum technologies, such as quantum information processing, networking, and metrology [1]. Entangled photon pairs, in particular, have applications in solid-state quantum repeaters, a crucial component of long-distance quantum networking that overcomes transmission loss by leveraging the effects of entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation [2][3][4][5][6][7]. Despite the diverse applications for such nonclassical states of light, methods for generating them deterministically remain limited. Currently, successful approaches are based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion [8][9][10] or spontaneous four-wave mixing [11,12] with high performance [13][14][15]. A major drawback of such methods is that the number of photon pairs generated follows a Poissonian distribution [16], rendering the pair generation efficiency too low for scalable quantum systems [3]. Semiconductor quantum dots can deterministically emit entangled photon pairs via biexciton decay cascade [2,[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] with high fidelity and emission efficiency. This mechanism, however, requires careful engineering of quantum dots and pumping schemes that poses a technological challenge, motivating the search for alternative pathways to the generation pairs.",
                "In this article, we provide the theoretical basis for a deterministic entangled photon pair source from a pair of dipole-coupled [25] three-level quantum emitters. Each emitter consists of a ground state and two optically active electronic excited states with mutually orthogonal transition dipole moments. The emergent electronic structure of the composite system then allows for the implementation of a radiative decay cascade from a symmetric doubly excited state of the pair, which results in the emission of two entangled photons of orthogonal polarization. We analyze the resulting emission spectra to note qualitative signatures of entanglement, especially in the cross-correlation spectrum.",
                "To better quantify the entanglement of the emitted photon pairs in continuous frequency space, we calculate their entanglement entropy S and Bell state fidelity F. Importantly, Bell state fidelity F can be optimized at the expense of the entanglement entropy S by tuning the defect transition dipole moments and concentrating the probability density within the states of interest, or the ideal Bell state. In addition, we find that the entanglement measures of the emitted photons are robust to relative differences in frequency between the intermediate states, while the fidelity in the presence of phonon-based dephasing is limited when the dephasing rate is on the order of the radiative rate or higher. We also present a method of initializing the system with orthogonally polarized continuous wave lasers that involves two-photon absorption to enable Rabi oscillations between the ground and symmetric doubly excited state of the pair.",
                "This scheme has the advantage of requiring only emitters with well understood singly-excited states that can be realized by a variety of physical systems, whereas accurate determination of the energetics of multiply excited states from first principles remains a challenge. We specifically discuss the applicability of defect emitters, given their fixed geometries enabling stable dipole coupling, diverse symmetries that allow nondegenerate transitions with orthogonal transition dipole moments, and emission properties that can be tailored via external fields. In addition, the chemical selection space of defect systems is vast. The present scheme is, however, likely amenable to dipole-coupled quantum dots or molecules as well, although they may lack certain advantages of dipolecoupled defect centers. The ability to generate entangled photon pairs from defects would enable on-chip integration [12] with quantum memories and emitters, minimizing the need to transduce photons from source to storage to emission in quantum technologies."

To understand the origin of this observation, in Fig. 3(c) we plot the first few Schmidt coefficients \u03bb n when: (i) d x = d y , corresponding to the state analyzed in Fig. 2, (ii) S and F are minimized, and (iii) both \u03b7 and F > 0.90. In (i), we see that \u03bb n come in pairs, mean-ing that this state is a superposition of many high-fidelity, polarization-entangled Bell states. In (ii), where S and F are minimized, \u03bb n decays more quickly than in (i). Nearly all of the population is concentrated in the first state, so there are fewer entangled states, lowering S. A balance is achieved in (iii) where probability density is concentrated within the first two pairs of entangled states, but \u03bb 0 = \u03bb 1 . Thus, by tuning the transition frequencies, we can optimize for F or \u03b7. The entanglement measures are robust to changes in \u03c9 X,1 -\u03c9 Y,1 , and F and S are relatively unaffected by up to an order of magnitude increase in \u03b3 g,y S , as shown in Appendix C. We also show that the fidelity in the presence of dephasing is limited by the radiative linewidth \u223c\u03b3 g,yS in Appendix D, suggesting optimal operation under dilution fridge conditions. Finally, we note that the emitted photon pairs can undergo entanglement distillation to further enhance the Bell state fidelity [34,[37][38][39][40]."

The fidelity F de in the presence of dephasing can be estimated as where |\u03c8 de (\u03c9 x S , \u03c9 y S , \u03c9 xy S ) is calculated just as |\u03c8 is in Eq. (11), except that the central frequencies of the emitters \u03c9 i are substituted by \u03c9 0 i in Eq. ( 7), where i \u2208 {x S , y S , xy S }. Explicitly, |\u03c8 = |\u03c8 de (\u03c9 x S , \u03c9 y S , \u03c9 xy S ) , as in Eq. ( 11). We assume that \u03c9 0",
                "x S , \u03c9 0 y S , and \u03c9 xy S belong to a probability distribution P. While the exact probability distribution depends on the microscopic physical mechanism underlying dephasing, we choose to represent P as a 3D Gaussian [74] i G i ( \u03c9 i , \u03c3 ), physically representing independent fluctuations of the energy levels of the relevant excited states following a Gaussian distribution. We plot the fidelity in the presence of phonon-based dephasing in Fig. 5, where \u03c3 i is the full width at half maximum, representing the dephasing rate and \u03c9 i = \u03c9 0 i -\u03c9 i .",

                "The fidelity in the presence of dephasing F de is limited by the radiative linewidth \u03b3 g,xS , suggesting ideal operation in dilution fridges for the rates described here. Lastly, we note that while we have considered the effect of phonon-based dephasing on the performance of the presently described scheme, we have not considered phonon-assisted transitions between, for instance, symmetric and antisymmetric states in the composite energy diagram in Fig. 1. These effects are known to have a major impact on the resulting collection efficiency of entangled photon pairs from the biexciton decay cascade of semiconducting quantum dots, as described in Sec. IV, and warrant further investigation upon selection of a candidate defect system."
