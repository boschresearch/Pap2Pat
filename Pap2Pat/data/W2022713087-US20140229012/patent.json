Since these systems integrate cooling, heating and power generation capabilities at one site, they result in potentially lower capital costs. The presence of multiple energy sources which characterizes these systems also provides a significant potential for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse emissions.",

Detailed models for CCHP components are available. However, integration of such detailed models for plant-wide optimization may result in large computation times and other practical concerns related to implementation.",

An exemplary embodiment of the CCHP plant is illustrated in FIG. 3. The CCHP plant includes seven electric chillers 211 that generate cold water (e.g., lowers temperature of water received) for cooling or for storage in a thermal energy storage (TES) tank 212. In an exemplary embodiment, the chillers 211 are electric chillers. The chillers 211 and the TES tank 212 form the source components of the cooling element 210 to meet cooling demands. The CCHP plant further includes a gas turbine 231 and a steam turbine 232 that provide electrical power. The thermodynamic energy of the exhaust from the gas turbine 231 is used to heat water in a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) 221 to produce steam to drive the steam turbine 232 and hot water to provide heat. Thus, the gas turbine 231 and the steam turbine 232 form the source components of the power supply element 230 to meet power needs. The HRSG 221 or the HRSG 221 in combination with the gas turbine 231 may be considered the source components of the heating element 220 to meet the heating demands.",

For example, the method can be applied to a plant that includes only a heating element, only a cooling element, only a power element, or various combinations thereof.",

The chiller 211 may include one or more underlying components, such as evaporators, condensers, compressors, cooling towers, and water pumps. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the evaporators and/or condensers are modeled using a Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD) approach, the compressors are modeled using a non-isentropic compression process with appropriate isentropic efficiency lookup maps, and the cooling towers are modeled using the Number of Transfer Units (NTU) framework. These models can be verified against experimental data available for the chillers 211. For example, if the coefficient of performance (COP), a chiller efficiency metric, of the experimental data matches well with predictions made by the selected model, the correct model has been chosen.",

It may be assumed that the tank 212 is well-insulated from the ambient and also that at any given time, the tank 212 is either charging or discharging. In the charging mode, a portion of the supply water from the chiller system is fed into the tank 212 for storage from the bottom. In the discharging mode, cold water from the tank 212 is used to meet cooling demands. The complex model may be verified if a temperature profile generated from experimental data compares well against the temperature profile of the complex model.",

When this assumption is made, the chilled water mass flow rate MCHW,i (e.g. kg/s) of chiller \u2018i\u2019 becomes the only independent variable input to the model. Thus, the amount of cooling QCHW,i (KW) provided by chiller \u2018i\u2019 can be represented by Equation 1 as follows:",

Using data obtained from the complex model of the chiller 211, a relationship between the compressor power consumption Wcomp,i and the amount of cooling QCHW,i may be obtained by performing a regression analysis on each of chillers 211. Table 1 shows examples of these relationships for each of the chillers in the CCHP plant.",
