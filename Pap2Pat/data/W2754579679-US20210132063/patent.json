                        "Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is one of five species of parasites that cause malaria in humans. This disease is marked by severe fever and pain, and can be fatal. The symptoms are caused by the parasite's infection, and destruction, of red blood cells in the subject. Infection of new subjects occurs when infectious mosquitoes take a blood meal from humans and inoculate parasites with their saliva.",
                        "Like one other species that infects humans, P. ovale, P. vivax has the ability to \u201chide\u201d in the liver of a subject and remain dormant\u2014and asymptomatic\u2014before (re-)emerging to cause renewed bloodstage infections and malarial symptoms. Transmission from humans to mosquitoes can only occur when the sexual stages of the parasite (gametocytes) are circulating in the blood. Liver-stage infection with hypnozoites is completely undetectable and asymptomatic, and transmission to mosquitoes is not possible. P. falciparum and P. knowlesi do not have this ability. P. malariae can cause recurrent infections but it remains unclear if these infections persist in the bloodstream, the liver or another organ. This ability to hide from the immune system in the liver for prolonged periods makes P. vivax and P. ovale particularly difficult to detect and treat.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows the overall life cycle of the P. vivax parasite (see Mueller, I. et al. Key gaps in the knowledge of Plasmodium vivax, a neglected human malaria parasite. Lancet Infectious Diseases 9, 555-566 (2009)). During a blood meal, a malaria-infected female Anopheles mosquito inoculates sporozoites into the human host (1). Sporozoites infect liver cells (2) and either enter a dormant hypnozoite state or mature into schizonts (3), which rupture and release merozoites (4). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony A), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony B). Merozoites infect red blood cells (5). The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing further merozoites into the blood stream (6). Some parasites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (7). Blood stage parasites are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease.",
                        "The gametocytes, male (microgametocytes) and female (macrogametocytes), are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal (8). The parasites' multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle (C). While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes (9). The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (10) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts (11). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (12), which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands. Inoculation of the sporozoites (1) into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle.",
                        "Diagnosis of subjects with P. vivax infections is of paramount importance to reducing or even eliminating transmission in a population. Such diagnosis would also significantly help individual subjects to receive proper treatment, including those that have only silent liverstage infections. Given the high degree of population mobility today, particularly in response to natural disasters or human conflicts, accurate and rapid diagnosis of all P. vivax infections has become even more important to controlling the disease. In addition, as transmission in countries decreases (as each population approaches elimination of the disease), population-level surveillance becomes increasingly important. This surveillance will aid in determining residual areas of transmission within a country, and can also be used to provide evidence for the absence of transmission indicating that elimination has been achieved.",
                        "Some proteins have been very well studied and characterized for diagnostic purposes. For example, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), in particular certain C-terminal MSP1-19 fragments and the N-terminal Pv200L fragments have been described as suitable diagnostic antigens. Some examples of prior publications related to this protein include U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,235, which focuses on a fragment of this protein for diagnostic purposes; WO9208795A1, which focuses on this protein for diagnosis; and US20100119539. Merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) is described with regard to a diagnostic tool in U.S. Pat. No. 7,488,489. MSP3.10 [merozoite surface protein 3 alpha (MSP3a)] is described as part of the family of merozoite surface protein 3 like proteins for diagnostic and other purposes in US20070098738. Rhoptry associated membrane antigen is described with regard to a diagnostic tool in EP0372019 B1. Many other proteins were described in relation to their immunogenicity and hence their therapeutic utility as part of a vaccine. Some non-limiting examples are given below.",
                        "Still other proteins have barely been described or characterized in the literature. In some cases, these proteins have not yet been described with regard to their stage in the P. vivax life cycle. In other cases, an initial determination of the stage has been made but their diagnostic or therapeutic utility is not known. A non-limiting list of some of these proteins is provided below. A further list is provided with regard to Appendix I, although optionally any annotated proteins from P. vivax in Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) or another suitable protein database could be included.",
                        "Very few attempts have been made to characterize the life cycle of the parasite within the body for diagnostic purposes, in terms of the dynamics of the proteins or antibody responses to specific proteins present in the blood. For example, an assay for determining a state of protective immunity is described in US20160216276. However, the disclosure relates to diagnostic assays for identifying individuals that are protected against Plasmodium falciparum caused malaria. As noted above, P. falciparum does not have a dormant liver stage with long-latency giving rise to relapses. This patent application does not mention P. vivax.",
                        "Other prior art disclosures for diagnostics focus only on the blood stage of P. vivax, which again prevents a complete picture of the dynamics of the infection in the subject from being determined. U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,861 and US20090117602 both suffer from this deficiency.",
                        "In other cases, where a plurality of antigens were examined for malarial diagnostics of P. vivax, the results still did not provide a complete picture of the dynamics of the infection in the subject. For example, \u201cGenome-Scale Protein Microarray Comparison of Human Antibody Responses in Plasmodium vivax Relapse and Reinfection\u201d (Chuquiyauri et al; Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 93(4), 2015, pp. 801-809) suffered from the following drawbacks:",
                        "i) It only features antibody signatures that differentiate between blood-stage infections that are thought to stem either from direct infections or relapsing infections;",
                        "ii) The phenotypes are of poor quality because they are focused on genotyping with only one gene, so may overestimate the number of new infections vs relapses;",
                        "iii) They are only looking at the presence and titer of antigens at one timepoint (i.e. at the time of infection).",
                        "In another example, \u201cSerological markers to measure recent changes in malaria at population level in Cambodia\u201d (Kerkhof et al; Malaria Journal, 15 (1), 2016, pp. 529, the authors calculated estimated antibody half-lives to 19 Plasmodium proteins, including 5 P. vivax proteins. These 5 proteins are well-known vaccine candidates (CSP, AMA1, EBP, DBP and MSP1), and the work included no formal antigen down-selection. A major limitation of this study is that individuals were only assessed for malaria prevalence every 6 months, and hence the estimated half-lives are not a true biological reflection of what occurs in the absence of re-infection. The authors only identified one P. vivax antigen, EBP, that had an estimated antibody half-life of less than 2 years."

                        "The present invention, in at least some embodiments, is of a system, method, apparatus and diagnostic test for Plasmodium vivax, to determine a likelihood of a specific timing of infection by P. vivax in a subject, and hence identify individuals with a high probability of being infected with otherwise undetectable liver-stage hypnozoites. According to at least some embodiments, the system, method, apparatus and diagnostic test relate to the identification of hypnozoites (\u201cdormant\u201d liver-stages), or at least of the likelihood of the subject being so infected. Optionally and preferably, the specific timing relates to recent infections, for example within the last 9 months. Without wishing to be limited by a closed list, the present invention is able to identify such recent infections, and not just current infections.",
                        "Non-limiting examples of elapsed time periods since an infection include time since infection ranging from 0 to 12 months, and each time period in between, by month, by week, and/or by day. Optionally and preferably a particular time period is determined as a binary decision of a more recent or an older infection, with each time point as a cut-off. As a non-limiting example, one such cut off could determine whether an infection in a subject was within the past 9 months or later than the past 9 months.",
                        "Optionally the timing of such an infection may also be determined, such that one or more of the following parameters may be determined. One such parameter is optionally whether the infection is a first infection in the patient, of P. vivax generally or of a particular strain of P. vivax. As there is no sterilizing immunity in malaria, immunity to one strain does not necessarily confer immunity to another, different strain. However, as described in greater detail below with regard to the examples, the present invention was tested by using samples from three different regions (including Brazil, Thailand and the Solomon Islands). These three populations are genetically highly diverse and represent the major part of the global genetic variation in P. vivax. Consequently, the present inventors believe, without wishing to be limited by a single hypothesis, that it will work anywhere in the world. Other parameters relate to time elapsed from the previous infection.",
                        "According to at least some embodiments, the antibody measurements may optionally be used to provide an estimation of elapsed time since last infection. An estimate of the time since last P. vivax blood-stage infection\u2014depending on the available calibration data\u2014can be defined either as the time since last PCR-detectable blood-stage parasitemia, or as the time since last infective mosquito bite. Time since last infection can be estimated continuously or categorically. Concurrent estimation of uncertainty will be important.",
                        "According to at least some embodiments, the antibody measurements may optionally be used to provide a determination of medium-term serological exposure, for example a frequency of infections during a particular time period and/or time since last infection.",

As described herein, detection of a dormant infection optionally comprises prediction from an indirect measurement of an antibody level.",
                        "During the life cycle of P. vivax, blood-stage forms of the parasite can initially be present at the same time as arrested liver forms, as described in the Background of the Invention. Even after the blood-stage infection has cleared, hypnozoites can still be present in the liver, and the parasite may still be indirectly detected via persisting antibody responses against the primary blood-stage infection. According to at least some embodiments, there is provided a system, method, apparatus and diagnostic test for detection of antibodies to malarial proteins that are present in the blood that indicate a high degree of probability of liver-stage infection.",
                        "According to at least some embodiments, there is provided a system, method, apparatus and diagnostic test for determination of the progression of infection by P. vivax in a population of a plurality of subjects. Optionally, it is possible to determine the rate of propagation of a particular Plasmodium species in a population not previously exposed to that species.",

Briefly, 57 symptomatic P. vivax patients were enrolled from either the Tha Song Yang malaria clinic or hospital. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and those aged younger than 7 years or more than 80 years were excluded. Patients were treated with chloroquine (25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) and primaquine (15 mg daily, for 14 days) according to the standard Thai treatment regimen. Anti-malarial drugs were given under directly-observed treatment in order to reduce the likelihood of treatment failure and the presence of recurrent infections during follow-up. Volunteers were followed for 9-months following enrolment, with finger-prick blood samples collected at enrolment and week 1, then every 2 weeks for 6 months, then every month until the end of the study. Blood was separated into packed red cells and plasma at the field site. All blood samples were analysed by both light microscopy and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the presence of blood-stage parasites.

For very large proteins, fragments were expressed that together cover the entire protein. These were treated as individual constructs in the down-selection process. The proteins were first produced at a small-scale with a biotin tag for the antigen discovery study, at Ehime University. A panel of 342 P. vivax proteins were assessed, including well-known P. vivax proteins such as potential vaccine candidates (i.e. MSP1, AMA1, CSP), orthologs of immunogenic P. falciparum proteins and proteins with a predicted signal peptide (SP) and/or 1-3 transmembrane domains (TM) (4). The genes were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pEU_E01 vector with N-terminal His-bis tag (CellFree Sciences, Matsuyama, Japan). P. vivax genes were obtained either from parent clones (4), using SAL-1 cDNA, or commercially synthesized from Genscript (Japan). The recombinant proteins were expressed without codon optimization using the wheat germ cell-free (WGCF) system as previously described (5). WGCF synthesis of the P. vivax protein library was based on the previously described bilayer diffusion system (6). For biotinylation of proteins, 500 nM D-biotin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was added to both the translation and substrate layers. Crude WGCF expressed BirA (1 \u03bcl) was added to the translation layer. In vitro transcription and cell-free protein synthesis for the P. vivax protein library were carried out using the GenDecoder 1000 robotic synthesizer (CellFree Sciences) as previously described (7, 8). Expression of the proteins was confirmed by western blot using HRP-conjugated streptavidin.",
                                "Large-scale protein expression for the down-selected candidates was then performed (CellFree Sciences Tokyo, Japan). Genes were synthesized by GenScript (Japan) and the products cloned into the pEU-E01-MCS expression vector. The sequence of all gene synthesis products and their correct insertion into the expression vector was confirmed by full-length sequencing of the vector inserts. Transcription was performed utilizing SP6 RNA polymerase (80 U/\u03bcl) and the SP6 promoter in the pEU-E01-MCS expression vector. For large-scale expression, a dialysis-based refeeding assay was used, with protein expression and solubility first tested on a 50 scale. The test results then enabled production on a 3 ml scale (maintained for up to 72 hours, 15\u00b0 C.) to produce at least 300 \u03bcg of each target protein, using the wheat germ extract WEPRO7240H. The proteins were manually purified one-time on an affinity matrix (Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow from GE Healthcare, Chalfont, United Kingdom) using a batch method (all proteins were expressed with a His-tag at the C terminus). The purified proteins were stored and shipped in the following buffer: 20 mM Na-phosphate pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 500 mM imidazole and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Protein yields and purity were determined using 15% SDS page followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using standard laboratory methods. In addition, proteins were also analyzed by Western Blot using an anti-His-tag antibody.",
                                "An additional 25 proteins were also used in the validation study. 12 proteins were produced using the wheat-germ cell free system described above at Ehime University, and were selected based on associations with past exposure in preliminary work conducted in a PNG cohort. The remaining 13 proteins were produced using standard E. coli methods, and were selected based on their predicted high immunogenicity (due to their status as potential vaccine candidates).

Plasma samples from the sub-set of volunteers (n=32 Thailand, n=33 Brazil) were used from four time-points, enrollment (week 0) and weeks 12, 24 and 36. Responses were measured against 342 P. vivax proteins. The assay was conducted as previously reported (9), with slight modifications. The protocol was automated by use of the JANUS Automated Workstation (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Science, Boston, Mass.). Reactions were carried out in 25 \u03bcl of reaction volume per well in 384-well OptiPlate microtiter plates (PerkinElmer). First, 0.1 \u03bcl of the translation mixture containing a recombinant P. vivax biotinylated protein was diluted 50-fold (5 \u03bcl), mixed with 10 \u03bcl of 4000-fold diluted plasma in reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.0], 0.01% [v/v] Tween-20 and 0.1% [w/v] bovine serum albumin), and incubated for 30 min at 26\u00b0 C. to form an antigen-antibody complex. Subsequently, a 10 \u03bcl suspension of streptavidin-coated donor-beads and acceptor-beads (PerkinElmer) conjugated with protein G (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass.) in the reaction buffer was added to a final concentration of 12 \u03bcg/ml of both beads. The mixture was incubated at 26\u00b0 C. for one hour in the dark to allow the donor and acceptor-beads to optimally bind to biotin and human IgG, respectively. Upon illumination of this complex, a luminescence signal at 620 rim was detected by the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer) and the result was expressed as AlphaScreen counts. A translation mixture of WGCF without template mRNA was used as a negative control. Each assay plate contained a standard curve of total biotinylated rabbit IgG. This enabled standardisation between plates using a 5-parameter logistic standard curve. All samples were run in triplicate. Reading the plates was conducted in a randomized manner to avoid biases."

The raw AlphaScreen data was converted based on the plate-specific standard curve, resulting in relative antibody units ranging from 0-400. Using the converted data, seropositivity was defined as a relative antibody unit greater than 0. For proteins that were defined as immunoreactive (more than 10% individuals seropositive at baseline, time of P. vivax infection), an estimated antibody half-life was determined using a mixed-effects linear regression model, described in detail below (see Statistical modelling). Using the metadata on immunoreactivity and half-life, an initial round of antigen down-selection was performed, with prioritisation of antigens that had similar estimated half-lives in both the Thai and Brazilian datasets (neither site more than double the other), high levels of seropositivity at baseline (more than 50% individuals seropositive, i.e. relative antibody units above 0), and low levels of error estimated in the model.

As shown in the process of FIG. 2A, antigens were first down-selected based on prioritization of metadata characteristics such as similar levels of estimated antibody longevity in Thailand and Brazil, high levels of immunogenicity at the time of infection and low levels of error estimated in the model. As shown in the process of FIG. 2B, using the initial down-selected antigens, further modelling was performed to identify the optimal combination of antigens able to accurately estimate the time since last infection.

The initial down-selection was followed by further model-based down selection. The model-based down-selection was used to determine the ability of various proteins to predict the time since last infection, utilizing the same datasets from Thailand and Brazil, and to determine the best combination of proteins to do so successfully (see for example FIG. 20 and its accompanying description). Antigens were excluded from selection if they had less than a 40% probability of inclusion in a 40-antigen panel that was able to accurately determine the time since last infection. Remaining antigens were then ranked according to a high probability of inclusion in a successful 20-antigen panel. When required, ranking in 30 and 40-antigen panels was also considered. Antigens were excluded if they had unfavorable protein production characteristics, such as low-yield in the small-scale WGCF expression or presence of aggregates. Three rounds of selection were performed: the first resulted in 12 proteins, the second in a further 12, and the third in an additional 31 candidates. A final list of 55 protein constructs (53 unique proteins) representing candidate serological markers of recent exposure to P. vivax infection was generated (two fragments were included from two different antigens).

For most proteins, there was a clear significant association with both past and current P. vivax infections, which is promising for the use of these antigens as serological markers. For others, there was a trend towards an association, which did not reach significance.

A classification algorithm can take a diverse range of input data and provide some binary or categorical classification as output. A regression algorithm can take similar input, but provides a continuous prediction as output. Table 2 provides an overview of some algorithms that can be used for classification problems. Four of these have been regularly described in the statistical learning literature: linear discriminant analysis (LDA); quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA); decision trees; and random forests. One of these has been specifically developed for the application at hand: combined antibody dynamics (CAD). The candidate algorithms are classified according to a number of factors. The degree of transparency describes the straightforwardness and reproducibility of an algorithm. A decision tree is considered very transparent as it can be followed by a moderately well-informed individual, as it requires answering a sequence of questions in response to measured data. This simple, logical structure makes decision trees particularly popular with doctors. Because of the transparency and ease of use, decision trees are sometimes referred to as glass box algorithms. At the other extreme, algorithms such as random forests are considered to be black box algorithms where there may be no obvious association between the inputs and outputs."
