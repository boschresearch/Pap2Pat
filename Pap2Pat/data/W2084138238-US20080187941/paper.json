    "title": "Trans-splicing as a novel method to rapidly produce antibody fusion proteins",
    "date": "2009-07-01",
    "abstract": "To cultivate the use of trans-splicing as a novel means to rapidly express various antibody fusion proteins, we tried to express antibody-reporter enzyme fusions in a COS-1 co-transfection model. When a vector designed to induce trans-splicing with IgH pre-mRNA was co-transfected with a vector encoding the mouse IgM locus, the expression of V(H)-secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as well as Fab-SEAP were successfully expressed both in mRNA and protein levels. Especially, the vectors encoding complementary sequence to Smu as a binding domain was accurate and efficient, producing trans-spliced mRNA of up to 2% of cis-spliced one. Since Smu sequence should exist in every IgH pre-mRNA, our finding will lead to the rapid production and analysis of various antibody-enzyme fusions suitable for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or antibody-dependent enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT).",

                "Recently, spliceosome-mediated trans-splicing is receiving considerable attentions both as an intriguing natural phenomenon and as a new means to repair/engineer natural pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) [1][2][3][4]. This is a kind of splicing by which exons from separately transcribed precursor RNA molecules are joined when an mRNA is generated. A gene on chromosomal DNA contains coding regions (exons) and is generally transcribed into a pre-mRNA containing intervening noncoding regions (introns). Such introns are removed from the pre-mRNA via a fine process referred to as splicing. Splicing is known to take place as an interaction coordinated by several small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and many protein factors that assemble to form an enzyme complex known as a spliceosome.",
                "In most cases, the splicing reaction takes place within the same pre-mRNA molecule, which is referred to as cis-splicing. Splicing that takes place between two independently-transcribed pre-mRNAs is referred to as trans-splicing. Trans-splicing was discovered for the first time in Trypanosoma [5,6] and then discovered in nematode, flatworm [7,8], and plant mitochondria [9]. To date, a method to restore the expression of a native protein in the protein-deficient cells by applying trans-splicing technique for gene therapy [1], or protein identification method that involve application of the technique to imaging within animals [2], or the method to express large amount of serum-albumin fused proteins in vivo [3] have been reported.",
                "Antibody fragments and their fusion proteins are indispensable tools as immunoassay reagents in diagnostics and molecular/cellular biotechnology. Especially, the fusion protein of antibody fragments and an reporter enzyme has become widely used in place of enzyme-labeled antibodies in immunoassays such as ELISA and Western blotting, since chemical conjugation needs many steps of reaction/purification that might affect the antibody activity. However, individual construction of an expression vector for each fusion protein needs tedious molecular cloning steps of at least two antibody variable region genes V H /V L , and more importantly, it is not always the case that the cloned genes show the same performance as the parent antibody. For example, the expression of cloned antibody genes by bacteria such as Escherichia coli with correct tertiary structure is not guaranteed because of the lack of proper folding machinery and/or post-translational modifications.",
                "To avoid such negative circumstance, the selection of positive clones by phage display or other selection method is often required. Moreover, frequently used bacterial alkaline phosphatase shows lower specific activity than the corresponding mammalian enzymes, which hampers its wider use as a detection reagent.",
                "As a potential technique to resolve the above problems, here we propose a method that enables the production of a fusion protein of antibody variable region and a reporter enzyme, within a short time without constructing individual expression vectors. As a result, we discovered that a target fusion protein could be produced conveniently within a short time by recovering fusion proteins generated within cells through the use of trans-splicing."

To further demonstrate the utility of this system for producing other types of antibody-fusion proteins, production of Fab-SEAP through trans-splicing was attempted. To this end, there were two possible ways: one was to make a TS vector that targets \u00b5CH 1 -\u00b5CH 2 intron. However, the length of this intron was rather short (110 bp), and the resultant TS vector would be class(IgM)-specific. The other was to use the same BD as for V H -SEAP, but supply C H1 domain sequence to the TS vector. Since this will allow higher TS efficiency without restriction of Ig class, we decided to take the latter approach, by inserting C H1 domain cDNA derived of human IgG 1 into the downstream of the 3' splice acceptor sequence of pTS-S\u00b51-SEAP.",
                                "Then the constructed vector pTS-S\u00b5C-SEAP was used to co-transfect COS-1 with pSV-V\u00b51 and a \u03bb1 expression vector pVCL. To confirm the existence of TS mRNA, cellular RNA was extracted as before, and used for RT-PCR to detect trans-and cis-spliced mRNAs (Fig. S2, A andB). As shown in Fig. S2A, a specific band of 700 bp, which was not observed for the RNA from the cells transfected with pTS-S\u00b5C-SEAP alone (lane 1) was clearly observed (lane 2). In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the band was also determined (Fig. S2C). A very clear chromatogram showing the expected V NP -h\u03b3C H1 joining was clearly observed.",
                                "From quantitative PCR, the amounts of cDNA from trans-and cis-spliced mRNAs were 8.50\u00d710 -6 and 4.82\u00d710 -4 (\u00b5g/\u00b5g total cDNA), respectively, for the triple transfectant. This result suggests a TS efficiency of 1.76%.",
                                "The culture supernatant one week after transfection was also used for SEAP assay as well as for ELISA that detects NP-specific AP activity. As a result, in both assays, significantly higher AP activities were detected than the other culture supernatants from the cells transfected with one or no plasmid 4)."

                        "TS had been implied as a potential mechanism in human-mouse chimeric immunoglobulin synthesis in transgenic mouse [16]. However, until now, no demonstration of artificially induced TS that utilize the IgH V-C intron has been reported. In this study, we constructed two types of TS vectors with and without C H1 domain. In both cases, the utility of S\u00b5 sequence as an antibody H chain-specific binding domain was suggested. The data presented by Puttaraju et al. [1] point to a strong correlation between the size of the binding domain and the frequency of TS, which peaks at around 150 bp and then sharply declines. This is in contrast to our result using more than 1 kb of BD. A possible reason is highly repeated nature of S\u00b5 region.",
                        "Our results demonstrate a new utility of S regions encoded in a rearranged IgH locus, especially S\u00b5. In our results, the secretion of each product protein (V H -SEAP and F ab -SEAP) to the culture supernatant as a result of pre-mRNA trans-splicing was strongly suggested. Especially, rapid production of V H -SEAP fusion protein will be useful in open-sandwich ELISA that measures antigen-dependent V H /V L interaction for antigen detection. [17,18] The possibility in immediate future is the direct expression of these TS vectors in hybridoma cells. We think this is quite feasible considering the previous report of successful trans-splicing from a transfected TS vector to endogenous IgH transcript in hybridoma [14]. In addition, recent report of in vivo experiment utilizing albumin transcript [3] suggests that when the target endogenous mRNA level is high, the level of targeted trans-spliced mRNA and the resultant protein production become significantly high. Since the transcription of immunoglobulin pre-mRNA in plasma cells is highly abundant, albeit less than that of albumin in hepatocytes, our finding will lead to the rapid production and analysis of various antibody-enzyme fusions suitable for ELISA, and also antibody-dependent enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) [19].
