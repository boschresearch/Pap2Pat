    "title": "The Concentration of Carbon Source in the Medium Affects the Quality of Virus-Like Particles of Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae",
    "date": "2014-04-08",
    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that virus-like particles (VLPs) recombinantly produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) are characterized by low structural stability, and that this is associated with reduced antigenicity and immunogenicity. However, little attention has been devoted to methods of improving the quality of the VLPs. Here, we investigated the effect of carbon source concentration in the medium on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 L1 VLPs expressed in S. cerevisiae from the galactose promoter. Media containing 2, 4, 6, and 8% carbon source, composed of both glucose and galactose in equal proportion, were used. VLP antigenicity was enhanced in cultures grown on media with 6 or 8% carbon source, compared to those from cultures with less than 6% carbon source. Moreover, the VLPs obtained from these cultures induced higher anti-HPV16 L1 IgG titers and neutralizing antibody titers in immunized mice than those purified from cultures with less than 6% carbon source. Our results indicate that the concentration of the carbon source in the medium plays a crucial role in determining the antigenicity and immunogenicity of HPV type16 L1 VLPs.",

                "The ongoing technological advances in genetic engineering and in the production of recombinant proteins have enabled the development of subunit vaccines that utilize as antigens monomeric proteins derived from pathogens [1]. Moreover, the development of peptide vaccines using synthetic pathogen epitopes has posed a considerable challenge [2]. Undoubtedly this challenge and others have contributed to the diversification of vaccine technologies and increased our understanding of mechanisms of infection. At the same time, however, a growing body of research suggests that both subunit and peptide vaccines have low immunogenicity, and that their ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies is quite limited [3], [4]. The low levels of pathogen-specific complexes and tertiary structures in these vaccines are regarded as the most problematic factors reducing their utility.",
                "Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multimeric protein complexes similar in shape to naturally occurring virions [5], [6]. They are noninfectious and safer than conventional inactivated or attenuated vaccines because they do not contain viral genetic material [7]. However, the most significant advantage of VLPs is that they possess capsid-specific neutralizing epitopes and a highly ordered structure resulting from the assembly of their subunit proteins [8], [9]. These repetitive conformational epitopes on the surface of the VLPs stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) more strongly than monomeric or disassembled antigens [8]. Moreover, due to their shape and size (20 \u2013 100 nm), these particles are preferentially taken up by APCs [9]. Consequently VLPs appear to have a greater ability to stimulate the immune system and evoke protective immunity than subunit or peptide vaccines.",
                "The recently developed strategy for producing VLPs has provided new insights into mechanisms protecting against pathogens, and yielded an innovative platform for developing high-efficacy vaccines. However, obtaining high-quality VLPs presents a challenge because of their structural complexity. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is one of the preferred expression systems used for producing VLPs [10]. It has been used to produce VLPs of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV), and the human papillomavirus (HPV) [10], [11], [12]; the HPV L1 recombinant proteins produced in S. cerevisiae possess the ability to self-assemble into VLPs. Another advantage of the yeast expression system is its low production cost. However, VLPs produced in this system are reported to have low structural stability [5], and this effect was correlated with decreased antigenicity and immunogenicity [13], [14].",
                "Many in vitro strategies for increasing VLP antigenicity and immunogenicity, such as redox refolding, VLP maturation, and salt treatment, have been tried with some success [13], [15], [16]. However, insufficient attention has been paid to strategies for improving the quality of the VLPs during cell culture, despite the fact that VLP bioprocessing in vivo relies on intracellular assembly. In this study, we compared the antigenicity and immunogenicity of HPV type 16 L1 protein (HPV16 L1) VLPs produced in the S. cerevisiae expression system with different concentrations of carbon source. Previously, we found that the concentration and composition of the carbon source used for S. cerevisiae producing HPV16 L1 protein significantly affect the yield of the HPV16 L1 protein [17]. In this study, we report that the concentration of the carbon source in yeast cultures substantially affects the quality of HPV16 L1 VLPs."

Fig 1A illustrates that the specific L1 protein production (mg L1/mg protein in lysate) increases with increasing carbon source concentration. Fig 1B is a graph showing the amount of L1 protein finally recovered after purification, which would be expected to increase as cell yield increases with cell mass in culture. These results indicate that the enhanced production of L1 protein in culture with 6% or 8% carbon source was reflected in the final yields of L1 protein (Fig. 1B).

As shown in Fig. 3, HPV16 L1 VLPs-6% and -8% had higher reactivity against H16.V5 and H16.E70 than HPV16 L1 VLPs-2% and -4%. It has been suggested that the hydrodynamic diameter of VLPs is inversely related to their antigenicity and immunogenicity [14], [24]. Figure S1 shows DLS plots for the four types of HPV16 L1 VLPs. The hydrodynamic sizes of the VLPs from cultures with 6% and 8% carbon source were smaller than in the remaining cultures.

Under these typical conditions, the preferred culture period is 48\u201372 h, because longer culture times can exhaust the energy source.",
                "In contrast with conventional fermentation strategies, in this study we obtained superior-quality HPV16 L1 VLPs from cultures containing 6 and 8% carbon source and after 6 days of culture. As shown in Fig. 1A, the yields of L1 protein increased with increasing concentrations of carbon source. Higher concentrations of L1 were previously found to facilitate the assembly of L1 proteins in vitro [27]. Therefore, the high L1 levels derived from the 6 or 8% carbon source cultures in our study may provide a favorable environment for the assembly of L1 into VLPs during cell culture and purification.",
                "Previously we found that the levels of conformational neutralizing epitopes on the surface of HPV16 VLPs increased with increasing culture duration when the culture contained more than 6% carbon source [17]. In the same study, we found that the proportion of soluble L1 protein in culture increased with longer culture duration [17]. These results demonstrated that in the yeast expression system longer culture periods may be necessary to obtain correctly folded L1 proteins that go on to form highly immunogenic HPV L1 VLPs. Based on our present findings, it appears that higher concentrations of carbon source make it possible to increase culture duration (due to the long stationary phase), which provides an opportunity for the yeast cells to make immunogenic L1 protein.",
                "Accumulating evidence suggests that the redox status of host cells plays a pivotal role in the infection and replication of viruses [28], [29]. Also, in vitro treatment of redox reagent affects VLP conformation and maturation [16]. Reduced glutathione (GSH) acts as a radical scavenger, with its redox-active sulfhydryl group reacting with oxidants to produce oxidized glutathione (GSSG) [30]. We have found that the levels of GSSG decreased in favor of GSH in prolonged cultures of S. cerevisiae producing HPV L1 (Figure S2), indicating that the intracellular redox state undergoes considerable change during the cell culture. The GSSG and GSH were measured as described previously [31]. Therefore, it is possible that a correlation exists between the folding and assembly of HPV L1 and intracellular redox status.",
                "Various culture conditions have been tested in an attempt to produce VLPs in the yeast expression system. Similarly, various types of purification protocols have been developed for VLPs. In previous reports we suggested that the choice of purification method could affect the structural integrity and immunogenicity of HPV16 L1 VLPs [13], [14]. Recently, Xie et al. suggested that column-purified VLPs have superior structural integrity to those purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation, a traditional purification method for viruses [32]. Our present results appear to confirm that culture conditions affect the quality of HPV16 L1 VLPs. Moreover, they suggest that the properties of VLPs are influenced by their in vivo and in vitro environments, indicating that much effort should be devoted to production protocols in order to achieve superior-quality VLPs. In the light of these findings, more diversified criteria for monitoring the quality of VLPs may be required. It is likely that further study of the changes in immunogenicity and structural integrity of VLPs as a function of culture conditions will provide valuable insights and help to develop high-efficacy and low-cost VLP vaccines."
