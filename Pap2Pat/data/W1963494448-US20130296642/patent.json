                        "The present invention relates to methods of predicting the occurrence of ventral hernias before initial surgery, and to methods of treating abdominal surgical incisions.",
                        "2. Description of Related Art",
                        "Incisional hernia repair comprises a significant proportion of a general surgeon's practice. The incidence of incisional hernias ranges from 2% to 11%, with a substantial recurrence rate reported between 10% and 50%. Based upon this estimate, 100,000 incisional hernia repairs are predicted to be performed each year costing $2.5 billion. While recurrence rates have decreased by using prosthetic mesh in the repair, a significant number of patients develop multiple recurrences with estimates in the literature ranging from 5% to 20%.",
                        "Several risk factors for developing incisional hernias have been identified including wound infection, abdominal distention, pulmonary complications, male gender, age, and obesity. Although risk factors for recurrent incisional hernias have also been evaluated, the literature is controversial with regard to many of these, such as body mass index, ascites, large hernias exceeding 10 cm in width or length, continued smoking, occupational lifting, and wound healing disorders (e.g., hematoma, seroma, infection).",
                        "Current data suggests that incisional hernias are commonly caused by failure of early surgical wound healing. Since collagen I provides tensile strength to connective tissue, and immature collagen III found in early wounds is weaker, investigations of the collagen I to III ratio have demonstrated a decreased ratio in patients with direct and indirect hernias as compared with controls. This decrease in the collagen I/III ratio was attributed to the relative increase in collagen III synthesis and was seen in incisional hernias. Moreover, a decreased collagen I/III ratio in incisional hernias supports the possibility of a high-risk group more susceptible to hernia formation. White and colleagues performed a preliminary immunohistochemical trial examining the skin and fascia of 16 incisional hernia patients for collagen I and III and compared the ratio to normal foregut collected from bariatric patients. They found a significant decrease in the ratio in the skin of the hernia patients but found no difference in the fascia. While patients with collagen and connective tissue diseases, such as Ehlers-Danlos, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Marfan's syndromes, are known to form hernias, there is no data on potential genetic predispositions to hernia formation in otherwise normal patients.",
                        "Thus, there remains a need for improved methods for diagnosing and predicting the risk of hernia occurrence of a particular patient before initial surgery, which provides guidance on treatment and incision healing for a particular patient."

                                "Biomarkers are detected by any methodology that can detect and distinguish the biomarker. A method for detection involves first capturing the biomarker and modified forms of it, e.g., with biospecific capture reagents, and then detecting the captured proteins by mass spectrometry. More specifically, the proteins are captured using biospecific capture reagents, such as antibodies, aptamers or Affibodies that recognize the biomarker. This method also will also result in the capture of protein interactors that are bound to the proteins or that are otherwise recognized by antibodies and that, themselves, can be biomarkers. Preferably, the biospecific capture reagents are bound to a solid phase. Then, the captured proteins can be detected by mass spectrometry or by eluting the proteins from the capture reagent and detecting the eluted proteins by mass spectrometry.",

Examples of supports include, but are not limited to, glass, silica chips, nylon (polyamide) membrane, polymer, plastic, ceramic, metal, coated on optical fibers, or infused into a gel matrix.",
                                "Preferably, the biospecific capture reagent is bound to a solid phase, such as a bead, a plate, a membrane or a chip. Methods of coupling biomolecules, such as antibodies, to a solid phase are well known in the art. They can employ, for example, bifunctional linking agents, or the solid phase can be derivatized with a reactive group, such as an epoxide or an imidizole, that will bind the molecule on contact. Biospecific capture reagents against different target proteins can be mixed in the same place, or they can be attached to solid phases in different physical or addressable locations. For example, one can load multiple columns with derivatized beads, each column able to capture a single protein cluster. Alternatively, one can pack a single column with different beads derivatized with capture reagents against a variety of protein clusters, thereby capturing all the analytes in a single place.

For example, in the skin of recurrent incisional hernia patients, many differentially expressed genes were found to be more abundant than expected in biologic processes such as: response to wounding; regulation of immune response; activation of plasma proteins during acute inflammatory response; lipid metabolic process; multicellular organismal development; and cell adhesion. Moreover, these analyses illustrate that many genes such as the collagen genes have diverse functions and appear in several BP categories. For instance, COL3A1 and FBN1 were associated with response to wound healing, blood coagulation, regulation of body fluids, as well as organ development. COL3A1 was also associated with regulation of immune response, regulation of multicellular organismal process, negative regulation of response to stimulus, cell-matrix adhesion, and negative regulation of immune system process.",

COL1A1 was overexpressed (2.33 fold) in the skin of recurrent incisional hernia patients as compared to NC, but was under expressed (0.34 fold) in the fascia. GREM1 was under expressed in both the skin (2.6 fold) and fascia (11.2 fold) of recurrent incisional hernia patients in comparison with NC (Online Resource 6). In order to explore the relationship between other relevant wound-healing genes, such as COL1A1 and COL3A1, a PCR array was used to measure gene expression on a subset of 15 remaining patient samples. Eighty genes on the PCR array were reliably expressed and were analyzed for differences. The PCR array results confirmed the microarray data as illustrated by the strong agreement of fold change (Pearson r=0.74, p<10-7) among the 39 genes common to both arrays which were detectable (FIG. 1). The 22 genes with large fold changes found by PCR array are reported in Table 5, with results for all genes on the PCR array presented in Online Resource 7.

                                "By microarray, COL1A1/COL3A1 ratio in skin of was slightly lower than NC patients, but was not significant (1.33 vs. 1.46, p=0.65). Similar but significant results were found for COL1A2/COL3A1 (0.59 vs. 0.79, p=0.02). Neither of these ratios were statistically different in the fascia. Immunohistochemistry on five patients demonstrated slightly greater staining intensity of COL3A1 than COL1A1 in the skin and fascia from RH patients in comparison with NC. Analysis by PCR array revealed that gene expression of COL3A1 was greater than COL1A2 (the second alpha chain of the collagen 1 molecule) in skin in both groups. According to the manufacturer, COL1A2 was selected because it was referenced more often in relation to fibrosis in public databases than COL1A1. Moreover, the ratio of COL1A2/COL3A1 was decreased in the RH group as compared to NC (1.51 vs. 2.26, p=0.058, one-sided t test). These results agree with reports in the literature [4-12].",
                                "The gene expression ratio of COL1A2/COL3A1, in conjunction with GREM1, was explored as a means of stratifying patients into NC or RH. We also considered COL1A2 and COL3A1 on their own (i.e., not in ratio form) in combination with GREM1. All pairwise combinations of these four markers were considered as means of classifying patients into their correct group (RH or NC) using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). QDA may be thought of as a method that yields the best curve (\u201cseparation boundary\u201d) that can be drawn in order to maximize the separation between the group means. We found that by using leave-one-out cross-validation, the combination of {GREM1, COL3A1} (FIG. 3) achieved the highest accuracy (86%), followed by either {COL3A1, COL1A2} or {COL1A2, COL1A2/COL3A1} at 73% accuracy, and {GREM1, COL1A2} or {GREM1, COL1A2/COL3A1} at 66% accuracy.",
                                "The molecular biology of hernia repair is largely unknown. Equally unclear is why incisional hernia repairs, either laparoscopic or open, frequently recur. We designed a pilot study, using microarrays, to identify potentially specific gene profiles in patients with recurrent incisional hernias (RH). We analyzed the skin and fascia from these patients and compared them to skin and fascia taken from patients who had no history of hernias (NC).",
                                "Our study was unique both in using a genomic-based approach (microarray and PCR array) and in taking skin and fascia samples away from the site of the incisional hernia. The acquisition of skin and fascia at the start of the procedure, prior to trocar placement, allowed us to avoid the confounder of biologic and pathologic processes occurring in the hernia (e.g., inflammation, wound healing) that could skew our results. Wound infection, for instance, has been widely reported as the most significant independent prognostic factor for incisional hernia [1, 20-22]. Although technical factors such as type of repair or use of mesh have been attributed to cause recurrence, they do not explain all hernia recurrences [1]. We theorized that variations in gene expression may play a role in wound healing and recurrence.",
                                "Our experiments have shown distinct gene expression profiles between the skin and fascia of RH and NC patients. When comparing active gene expression profiles, we found more statistically significant genes in the skin than the fascia. We found greater variability in gene expression in fascia than skin in our samples, which is apparent graphically (Online Resources 8 and 9). Since an increase in variance reduces the power to detect differences, this is the most obvious explanation for the shorter fascia gene list. The functions of the genes in the skin were diverse and included wound healing, transcription regulation, and immunology.",
                                "The sparse number of genes in the fascia precluded GO analysis. In the skin, GO analysis further expanded these to 53 BP functions, including regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses, organ development, and cell adhesion. GO analysis also revealed 10 CC and 18 MF categories, with most genes associated with the extracellular region and plasma membrane, and enzyme inhibitor activity and receptor binding, respectively. The relationship of these genes to known biologic functions can assist in our understanding of the basic science of hernia formation.",
                                "One of our most intriguing findings was altered GREM1 expression in the skin and fascia of RH patients. Originally isolated from the neural crest of the Xenopus as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist, GREM 1 is an important regulator of limb development and may play a role in regulating organogenesis, body patterning, as well as tissue differentiation [19, 23, 24]. High levels have been found in nondividing and terminally differentiated cells such as neurons, alveolar epithelial cells, and goblet cells [19, 24]. An earlier name of GREM1 was IHG-2 because its expression in glomerular mesangial cells was induced by high glucose, mechanical strain, and TGF-\u03b2 [25]. GREM1 has been suggested to be a modulator of mesangial cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation in diabetes and has been shown to have increased expression in various diabetic nephropathy models as well as being involved in the pathophysiology of progressive renal fibrogenetic diseases [26, 27]. Moreover, gene and protein expression have been reported in fibroblast cultures harvested from patients diagnosed with systemic sclerosis [28].",
                                "Although GREM1 has not been associated with hernia formation or wound healing, it has been found in the stromal cells of basal cell carcinomas [29]. This group also reported a concomitant expression of FOLLISTATIN (FST) in the stromal cells of basal cell carcinomas [29]. Interestingly, our data showed that FST-like 1 expression accompanied GREM1 expression in the skin of recurrent incisional hernia patients. The findings in the literature support a role for GREM1 in fibrosis of the skin and kidney and are suggestive of a role in hernia formation. The potential role of GREM1 becomes further substantiated when viewed from a perspective that defects in normal wound healing and mechanical strain are frequently cited as causes of hernia formation and recurrence. Although our microarray data were validated by qPCR and PCR array, we are in the process of further testing the role of GREM1 in an expanded population of patients.",
                                "More conventional genes of interest from our study were the eight genes directly involved with collagen synthesis and those associated with hernia formation, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome such as FBN1. Our data on COL1A1 and COL3A1 were validated by qPCR and PCR array. The ratio of collagen Ito collagen III decreased in the RH patients in comparison with NC as would be expected according to the literature [4-8]. These data are strengthened by the fact that a decrease was seen regardless of which collagen 1 alpha chain was analyzed. The clinical manifestations of Marfan's suggest that alterations in connective tissue stability may play an important role. Mutations in FBN1 are known to cause Marfan's syndrome and have been associated with tissue stability [30]. Recently, an immunohistochemcial study was performed on scar and nonscar regions of human skin and fascia [30]. The authors studied 22 patients who underwent repeated laparotomy: 12 had developed incisional hernia and 10 did not and were used as control. They found that FBN1 may be an important contributing factor to tissue stability and incisional hernia formation [30]."
