    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of biliary tract cancer (BTC) is important for curative surgical resection. Current tumor markers of BTC are unsatisfactory in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In a search for novel biomarkers for BTC, serum samples obtained from 62 patients with BTC were compared with those from patients with benign biliary diseases and from healthy controls, using the MALDI-TOF/TOF ClinProt system. Initial screening and further validation identified a peak at 4204 Da with significantly greater intensity in the BTC samples. The 4204 Da peak was partially purified and identified as a fragment of prothrombin by amino acid sequencing. The sensitivity of the 4204 Da peptide for detection of stage I BTC cancer was greater than those for CEA and CA19-9. Also, serum levels of the 4204 Da peptide were above the cut-off level in 15 (79%) of 19 cases in which the CEA and CA19-9 levels were both within their cut-off values. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the combination of the 4204 Da peptide and CA19-9 was significantly more sensitive for detection of stage I BTC cancer compared to CEA and CA19-9. These results suggest that this protein fragment may be a promising biomarker for biliary tract cancer.",

                "Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a neoplasm that accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers and 15% of all primary liver cancers. Over the last two decades, the incidence of BTC has risen, mainly due to an increase in the intrahepatic form [1, 2], which has a particularly high incidence in Northern Thailand [3]. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment and this requires an early diagnosis. Even in cases in which surgical resection with negative histological margins is achieved, the 5-year survival rates range from 20% to 40% [4, 5]. The mean one-year survival rate for unresectable cases is only 6 months [4]. Therefore, there is a need to establish a tool for early diagnosis of BTC. Currently, diagnosis of BTC depends on imaging of the biliary tree using computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in symptomatic subjects. Brush cytology during ERC can lead to morphological diagnosis, but the sensitivity is limited because of the highly desmoplastic reaction of BTC [5, 6]. For these reasons, tumor markers that can detect BTC with high diagnostic efficiency are urgently needed. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19-9) are tumor markers that are used for diagnosis of BTC, but their sensitivity and specificity are unsatisfactory [2, 7].",
                "Proteome analysis is increasingly being applied to cancer biomarker discovery. Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a proteomics technique used for high-throughput fingerprinting of serum proteins [8]. We have used this technology to identify diagnostic markers for alcohol abuse [9] and a prognostic marker for pancreatic cancer [10]. SELDI-TOF MS can be used to analyze many samples rapidly and simultaneously, but has drawbacks of high cost and difficulty with protein identification. More recently, high-throughput workflow with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) has been established for discovery and identification of serum peptides [11]. This method uses magnetic beads with different chemical chromatographic surfaces, instead of ProteinChip arrays. Proteins selectively bound to the magnetic beads are eluted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Compared with the SELDI-TOF MS ProteinChip system, the cost is low, and subsequent protein identification is relatively easy. We recently used the ClinProt system for MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to detect novel biomarkers for alcohol abuse that could not be detected using SELDI [12]. In the present study, we carried out a serum peptidome study to identify novel biomarkers for biliary tract cancer using the MALDI-TOF/TOF MS ClinProt system."

Clinicopathological data for all the subjects are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The BTC group (Table 2) included cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 17), Klatskin tumor (n = 7), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 16), tumor of the ampulla of Vater (n = 6), and gallbladder tumor (n = 16). The pathological stages of the BTC patients were defined according to the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer tumor node metastasis classification [13]. The patients with benign biliary diseases (Table 3) included cases of cholelithiasis (n = 24), benign fibrous stricture (n = 4), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 2). All the cases of BTC were diagnosed by radiological imaging. In 58 cases, cytology was also compatible with the diagnosis. All of the patients with benign biliary disease were diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and were followed up for more than 12 months to confirm that they had no malignancy. Serum samples were obtained and processed under standardized conditions that we have described elsewhere [14] and were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chiba University School of Medicine."

Each sample was duplicated, and quadruplicate spotting was performed using each eluate; eight spots were developed from each sample. The mean spectra from these eight spots were used for data analyses. These procedures from bead fractionation to spotting were performed automatically using the ClinProt robot (Bruker Daltonics) under strictly controlled humidity, as we previously described [14]."

The dried pellets were resuspended in buffer (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, vol/vol) and further separated by reversed-phase HPLC in an automated HPLC system (Shiseido Nanospace SI-2, Shiseido Fine Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). The concentrated flow-through sample (75\u2009\u03bcL) was directly loaded onto an Intrada WP-RP column (Imtakt, Kyoto, Japan).

However, the levels of mRNAs are not necessarily predictive of the corresponding protein levels. Indeed, a recent report indicated that the consistency between cDNA microarray and proteome-based profiles is limited for identification of candidate biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma [15]. Therefore, proteome analysis is a prerequisite for identification of novel biomarkers.",
                "Biliary tract cancer is a particularly lethal malignancy with a mean 1-year survival of only 6% for unresectable cases [4]. The lack of a sensitive and specific biomarker for early detection of BTC is one of the reasons for this limited survival. Cholangiocarcinoma often grows along the bile duct without forming a mass, and thus is often missed in CT and ultrasound. Serum biomarkers with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity are likely to be beneficial in the clinical management of this malignancy. There have been previous attempts to discover biomarkers for cholangiocarcinoma. Scarlett et al. conducted proteomic profiling of sera from cases of cholangiocarcinoma using SELDI-TOF MS and found that a serum peptide corresponding to a 4463\u2009m/z peak had superior discriminatory ability to CA19-9 and CEA, but did not identify the peak [16]. More recently, a membrane protein enrichment strategy coupled with 18O labeling-based quantitative proteomics was used to identify proteins that are highly expressed in cholangiocarcinoma tissues [17]. Golgi membrane protein, annexin IV, and epidermal growth factor were proposed as candidate markers. However, their diagnostic roles at the serum level were not described.",

In the present study, the sensitivities of CEA, CA19-9, and the 4204\u2009Da peptide for detection of all BTC cases were 50%, 61.3%, and 75.8%, respectively. It was of note that the sensitivity of 4204\u2009Da in stages I and II patients was far greater than those of the conventional markers and that serum 4204\u2009Da peptide levels were elevated in 79% of cases in which both CA19-9 and CEA were within their reference intervals. These findings suggest that this novel peptide is complementary to conventional markers in diagnosis of BTC. This is supported by the greater AUC with the combination of CEA, CA19-9, and the 4204\u2009Da peptide, compared to individual AUCs.",
                "The result obtained in identification of the 4204\u2009Da peptide was unexpected. The peptide was identified as a fragment of prothrombin, which makes it unlikely that the fragment originated from cancer tissues. It is possible that production of the fragment occurred in the cancer-tissue microenvironment. Alternatively, the 4204\u2009Da peptide might have been generated ex vivo by undefined degradative proteases during the clotting process [18]. The exact mechanism for production of the 4204\u2009Da peptide remains to be clarified. We also note that intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, and gall bladder carcinoma were analyzed together as BTCs in the present study. Separate analyses of these diseases on a larger scale are needed to discover biomarkers that are more specific for each form of BTC. Also, antibody-based verification will be necessary to further confirm the findings obtained in this study. Bile samples may also be an alternative for discovery of disease markers leaking from the biliary tree [19]."
