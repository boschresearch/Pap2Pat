                        "Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a neoplasm that accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers and 15% of all primary liver cancers. During the last two decades, the incidence of BTC is rising, mainly due to an increase in the intrahepatic form (Khan, S. A. et al., \u201cCholangiocarcinoma,\u201d Lancet, 366:1303-14 (2005); Patel, T. et al., \u201cCholangiocarcinoma,\u201d Nat Clin Pract Gastroentel Hepatol, 3:33-42 (2006)). North Thailand has the highest incidence (Shaib, Y. et al., \u201cThe epidemiology of holangiocarcinoma,\u201d Semin Liver Dis, 24:115-125 (2004)). Only chance to cure is complete surgical resection. For complete resection, diagnosis in early stage is important, but difficult. Even with margin free resection, 5-year survival figures only reach 20% to 40% (Jarmagin, W. R., et al., \u201cSurgical management of cholangiocarcinoma,\u201d Semin Liver Dis, 24:18 (2004); Gores, G. J., \u201cCholangocarcinoma: current concepts and insight,\u201d Hepatology, 37:961-969 (2003)). Unresectable disease usually shows 6-month to 1-year survival time (Jarmagin, W. R., et al., \u201cSurgical management of cholangiocarcinoma,\u201d Semin Liver Dis, 24:18 (2004)). Almost one-third of the patients of BTC is too late for resection. Therefore, there is a need to establish a diagnostic process at the early stage of BTC.",
                        "Currently, diagnosis of BTC depends on imagings of the biliary tree such as computed tomography or ultrasonography or endscopic retrogradal cholangiograpy (ERC) in patients having clinical symptoms. Brush cytology by ERC can make a tissue diagnosis, but sensitivity is poor because of rich desemoplasitc nature of BTC (Gores, G. J., \u201cCholangocarcinoma: current concepts and insight,\u201d Hepatology, 37:961-969 (2003); Abu-Hamda, E. M., et al., \u201cEndoscopic management of cholagiocarcinoma,\u201d Semin Liver Dis, 4:165-175 (2004)). Consequently clinicians often elucidate other diagnostic clues of malignancy, and tumor markers provide more information.",
                        "Serum tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbon hydorate antigen 19.9 (CA19-9) are used worldwide for diagnosis of BTC but they have poor sensitivity and specificity. Many reports represent the specificity of these markers are respectively 50% and 70% (Nehls, O. et al., \u201cSerum and Bile markers for cholangiocarcinoma,\u201d Semin Liver Dis, 24:139-154 (2004)). Therefore, there is a need for new markers of BTC. Before now, a proteomic technique has been used with a number of other malignancy to discover potential markers such as ovarian (Rai, A. J. et al., \u201cProteomic approaches to tumor marker discovery,\u201d Arch Pathol Lab Med, 126:1518-1526 (2002); Kozak, K. R., et al., \u201cIdentification of biomarkers for ovarian cancer using strong anion-ex-change Protein chip,\u201d 100:12343-12348 (2003); Petricoin, E. F., et al., \u201cUse of proteomic patterns in serum to identify ovarian cancer,\u201d Lancet, 359:572-577, (2002)), pancreatic (Rosty, C. et al., \u201cIdentification of hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/pancreatitis-associated protein I as a biomarker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by protein biochip technology,\u201d Cancer Res, 62:1868-1875 (2002); Koopmann, J, et al., \u201cSerum diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma using surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization mass spectrometry,\u201d Clin Cancer Res, 10:860-868 (2004); Yu, Y., et al., \u201cPrediction of pancreatic cancer by serum biomarkers using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-based decision tree classification,\u201d Oncology, 68:79-86 (2005), head and neck (Yu, Y. et al., \u201cPrediction of pancreatic cancer by serum biomarkers using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-based decision tree classification,\u201d Oncology, 68:79-86 (2005); Wadsworth, J.

At first, the low molecular peptide spectra obtained from biliary tract cancer was compared with those of normal controls and benign biliary disease (training set). Peak intensities of 23 peptides were significantly different in the BTC and normal control groups; of the 23 peptites, fifteen were upregulated and eight were downregulated in the BTC group (Table 2a). Then, the peptide profiling between BTC group and benign biliary disease group and normal control group (test set) was compared by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Peak patterns of BTC group and benign biliary disease group and normal control group were significantly different (FIG. 1). Among the 23 peptide peaks, which were different in BTC and normal benign biliary disease, and different in BTC and normal control group, the intensity of only one peptide peak with a m/z value of 4204 Da was significantly upregulated in the BTC group (Table 2b). FIG. 2 shows that serum level of the 4204 Da peptide significantly increased in BTCs sera (mean 388.84 AU: p<0.001), compared with normal control sera (mean 316.06 AU). In benign biliary disease, it was not increased (mean 317.36 arbitrary unit: p<0.01).",

The peak of the 4204 Da peptide relatively had a high mass spectrometric peak height, clear separation from other peaks, and significantly high expression in biliary tract cancer patients. To purify and identify the 4204 Da peptide, serum sample was fractionated on CM ceramic Hyper D F spin column. After the elute was precipitated by aceton, the sediment was resuspended with 0.1% TFA and applied to revease phase columns for further separation from other proteins, and the fractionation was carried out with stepwise gradient, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

                                "Matrix-associated laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is a proteomic technique that can identify a novel biomarker in serum and any biological fluid. This technique was used to identify new biomarkers of biliary tract cancer (BTC) because it is difficult to diagnose and has poor prognosis. Sera from 62 patient of BTC, and 30 benign biliary disease and 30 healthy volunteers were analyzed by ClinProt\u2122 system (Bruker Daltonics Inc). The most efficient protein peak to discriminate of patient with CC is mass-to-charge 4204 (p<0.05). m/z 4204 had superior discriminary ability to carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). (Area under the curve [AUC]=0.752, 0.732, 0.608). Sequential amino acid analysis identified this peptitde to be a prothrombin fragment. MALDI-TOF-MS accurately distinguished patients with BTC from patients with benign biliary disease and healthy volunteers was more accurate than traditional biomarkers in identifying BTC.",
                                "The need for better marker for the diagnosis of biliary tract cancer is an important target for clinical researchers. Proteomics represents a potentially powerful tool for the serologic recognition of protein profiles associated with cancer. The low molecular weight portion of the proteome, previously hidden by the limited resolution of 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, appears to carry an abundance of tumor specific information with the potential to improve both diagnosis and the understanding of tumor pathogenesis. MALDI-TOF MS, a proteomic approach searching the low molecular weight portion of the proteome, may by itself not only be used as a discovery tool, but also be diagnostic tool itself. In this study, using a MALDI-TOF MS analysis, novel serum biomarkers was found among low molecular weight peptides in biliary tract cancer, and this peptide was identified as a fragment of prothrombin with a molecular weight of 4204 Da.",
                                "Serum CA19-9 and CEA level have been used as markers for biliary tract cancer. Their use in BTC was recently evaluated by Nehls et al. (Nehls, O. et al., \u201cSerum and Bile markers for cholangiocarcinoma,\u201d Semin Liver Dis, 24:139-154 (2004)). They reported an average sensitivity of 71% and 51% and an average specificity of 78% and 88%. It is the most interesting discovery in this study that MALDI-TOF MS peak (m/z 4204) was as effective at discriminating cancer from benign serum such as the tumor markers CEA or CA19-9, and the combination of these markers significantly improved classification.",
                                "It is thought that biliary tract cancer arise on a background of continuous inflammation in biliary tree. The presence of gallstones, choledochal cyst, sclerosing cholangitis brings out this inflammation (Zheng, L. X. et al., \u201cExperience of congenital choledochal cyst in adults; treatment, surgical procedures and clinical outcome in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University,\u201d J Korean Med Sci, 19:842-847 (2004); Cullen, S. N. et al., \u201cReview article: current management of primary sclerosing cholangitis,\u201d Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 21:933-948 (2005)). Alterations in the serum protein profile would seem likely as a result of both the malignant process itself and secondary to the inflammatory response including release of cytokines and acute phase proteins from the liver. It was therefore important to have a control group of patients who did not have cancer but who had a variety of biliary inflammatory process with matched liver dysfunction.",
                                "Recently, many studies using proteomic approach such as MALDI-TOF MS and SELDI-TOF MS showed protein-expression of neoplasms, but these have not been developed to clinical application. Some studies have reported that biomarker panels with combination of some protein peaks have been useful. Biomarker panels were complicated and difficult to use at clinical situation. Therefore, a simple biomarker was elucidated and identified as a prothrombin fragment as m/z 4204 peptide.",
                                "Prothrombin, the precursor of \u03b1-thrombin, is synthesized in the hepatocytes and is gamma-carboxylated at its amino terminal end by a vitamin K-dependent carboxylase (Mann, K. G. et al., \u201cSurface-dependent reactions of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes,\u201d Blood, 76:1-16 (1990)). This carboxylation reaction is defective in hepatocelluer carcinoma (HCC) tissues and they secrete des-gammmacarboxy prothrombin (Kuromatsu, R. et al, \u201cUsefulness of ED036 kit for measuring serum PIVKA-II levels in small hepatocellular carcinoma,\u201d J Gastroenterol, 32:507-512 (1997)). DCP has been recently shown to act as a stimulant for hepatoma cell growth (Suzuki, M. et al., \u201cDes-\u03b3-carboxy prothrombin is a potential autlogus growth factor for hepatocellular carcinoma,\u201d J Biol Chem, 280:6409-6415 (2005)).",

It is possible that CC tissues secret a fragment of prothrombin such as DCP. Because 4204 Da peptide isn't affected by the time intervals between venipuncture and serum preparation, and freezing methods (Q), clinical application is hoped.",
