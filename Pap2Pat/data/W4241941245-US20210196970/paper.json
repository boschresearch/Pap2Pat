    "title": "The Synergistic Effect of Canady Helios Cold Atmospheric Plasma and A Folfirinox Regimen for The Treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma In Vitro",
    "date": "2021-01-11",
    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare biliary tract cancer with a low five-year survival rate and high recurrence rate after surgical resection. Currently treatment approaches include systemic chemotherapeutics such as FOLFIRINOX, a chemotherapy regimen is a possible treatment for severe CCA cases. A limitation of this chemotherapy regimen is its toxicity to patients and adverse events. There exists a need for therapies to alleviate the toxicity of a FOLFIRINOX regimen while enhancing or not altering its anticancer properties. Cold Atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a technology with a promising future as a selective cancer treatment. It is critical to know the potential interactions between CAP and adjuvant chemotherapeutics. In this study the aim is to characterize the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX and CAP in combination to understand potential synergetic effect on CCA cells. FOLFIRINOX treatment alone at the highest dose tested (53.8 nM fluorouracil, 13.1 nM Leucovorin, 5.1 nM Irinotecan, and 3.7 nM Oxaliplatin) reduced CCA cell viability to below 20% while CAP treatment alone for 7 min reduced viability to 3% (p < 0.05). An analysis of cell viability, proliferation, and cell cycle demonstrated that CAP in combination with FOLFIRINOX is more effective than either treatment alone at a lower FOLFIRINOX dose of 6.73 nM fluorouracil, 1.71 nM leucovorin, 0.63 nM irinotecan, and 0.47 nM oxaliplatin and a shorter CAP treatment of 1, 3, or 5 minutes. In conclusion, CAP has the potential to reduce the toxicity burden of FOLFIRINOX and warrants further investigation as an adjuvant therapy.",

                "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare and aggressive malignancy arising in the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary tract. It is often discovered in advanced late stages, and the prognosis is poor with a five-year survival rate under 20%1,2. Surgical resection or liver transplantation at an early stage are the best option for curative treatment of CCA3. However, CCA has a high recurrence rate after surgical resection4. Chemoresistance also presents a challenge in administering adjuvant chemotherapy and as a result, CCA is known for poor clinical outcomes5,6.",
                "For patients with recurrent CCA, gemcitabine and fluorouracil (5-FU) have been standard options as individual treatments or drug combination therapy for years7\u20139. The FOLFIRINOX protocol is a drug regimen consisting of fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The regimen is not yet standard clinical practice for CCA. In a phase two\u2013three clinical trial, FOLFIRINOX increased overall survival over gemcitabine treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer10. However the regimen was not well tolerated; the incidence of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia were significantly higher in FOLFIRINOX treatment patients10. To address this limitation, studies have focused on reducing dose or modifying the four components. Dosage iterations of modified FOLFOX-4, FOLFOX-5, and FOLFOX-7 have been used to treat pancreatic, colorectal, and bladder cancers11\u201313.",
                "Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been extensively studied in various biomedical fields. It is a novel approach to targeted cancer treatment and has demonstrated its anti-cancer effects in vitro14\u201317. The detailed mechanism have not been fully elucidated, however studies have established that CAP selectively induces apoptosis and DNA damage in tumor cells18\u201320. Further research indicates low doses of CAP does not damage normal tissue21\u201324. Recently, indirect CAP treatment was effective for the treatment of CCA in vitro, selectively killing CCA cells over normal hepatocytes25. Research on CAP in combination with other therapies has shown some potential synergism with anti-neoplastic agents in melanoma cells26, drug loaded nanoparticles in breast cancer cells27, gemcitabine in murine pancreatic cancer cells28, and temozolomide in glioblastoma cells29.",
                "The Canady Helios Cold Plasma System (CHCPS) paired with the Canady Helios Cold Plasma Scalpel has potential as an anti-cancer therapy (U.S. Patent No. 9999462)30. The CHCPS is currently subject to a phase I FDA Investigational Device Exemption Approval clinical trial in the United States and Israel. In this trial the Canady Helios Cold Plasma Scalpel delivers cold plasma at the surgical margins immediately after tumor resection. The temperature of our device during use ranges between 26 and 31\u00a0\u00b0C20. The CHCPS reduces viability of solid tumor cells and does not thermally damage normal tissue14,31. The system has shown efficacy in breast cancers representative of four molecular subtypes, and a 92\u201399% reduction in viability was achieved 48\u00a0h after CAP treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05)32.",
                "There is a need for investigation into therapies for CCA due to its poor prognosis, chemoresistance, and high recurrence rate. CAP is a potential adjuvant treatment. In this in vitro study dose-dependent experiments were performed on the human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICCA) cell line (KKU-055) to establish efficacy of CAP and FOLFIRINOX in combination. Various dose levels of both therapies individually and in combination were used to quantify changes in cell viability and cell cycle progression. FOLFIRINOX was administered as a first line therapy followed by CAP treatment to combine anti-cancer effects of both. We are the first to demonstrate the in vitro synergistic effects of FOLFIRINOX and CAP."

                        "Experiments were designed to measure cell confluence and cell cycle distribution after combining the 6.7\u00a0\u00b5M 5-FU dose of FOLFIRINOX (Table 1) and CAP at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0min. Cells were placed in the IncuCyte Live Cell imaging system immediately after CAP where confluence was monitored. Representative images of 0\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, and 48\u00a0h timepoints are shown to demonstrate cell confluence within treatment wells (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). In Fig.\u00a05, morphological differences can be seen between experiment conditions. No treatment and drug only treated cells are confluent at 48\u00a0h with most cells visibly fluorescent. In combination treatment wells, cells are not confluent and large clusters of cellular debris are visible 48\u00a0h after treatment.Figure 5(A\u2013H) Representative phase contrast images of fluorescently labeled KKU-055 cells 0, 24, and 48\u00a0h after no treatment, FOLFIRINOX (6.7\u00a0\u00b5M 5-FU, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5M leucovorin, 0.6\u00a0\u00b5M irinotecan, and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5M oxaliplatin), CAP at 120p (28.7\u00a0W) for 1, 3 or 5\u00a0min, and both in combination.",
                        "The number of cells in different phases of the cell cycle was quantified through fluorescence measurements. The quantifications of 0\u201324\u00a0h after CAP treatment at 1 and 3\u00a0min and 0\u20136\u00a0h after CAP for 5\u00a0min are plotted in Fig.\u00a06A\u2013H. In the no treatment and FOLFIRINOX only treated groups, most cells are in the mitotic phase (grey line), and the number of cells increases over time (Fig.\u00a06A,B). Also, the number of cells in S/G2/M phase (green line) increases in these wells. Conversely, cells treated with FOLFIRINOX and CAP were not proliferating. At a CAP dosage of 1\u00a0min, cells were moving through the cell cycle, as shown in the cyclic lines for all phases (Fig.\u00a06C). With a combination of FOLFIRINOX and CAP 1\u00a0min this progression is reduced, and the lines are less cyclic (Fig.\u00a06D). At CAP dosages of 3\u00a0min, the grey line of cells in M-G1 phase trended down after treatment as apoptosis occurred (Fig.\u00a06E,F). As shown in representative phase images Fig.\u00a05E,F cells started to die at the 24\u00a0h timepoint. CAP and FOLFIRINOX combination treatment hindered the cell cycle, and the number of cells in the mitotic phase was reduced compared to FOLFIRINOX or a low dose (1\u00a0min) of CAP alone. At CAP dosages of 5\u00a0min, apoptosis initiated immediately after treatment and dead cells aggregated within 6\u00a0h (data not shown) therefore cell cycle data were not plotted beyond this timepoint in Fig.\u00a06G,H. Cells treated with FOLFIRINOX and CAP in combination completely died within 24\u00a0h. Clusters of dead cells can be seen in Fig.\u00a05G,H 24\u00a0h after CAP treatment.Figure 6The FOLFIRINOX dosage of 6.7\u00a0\u00b5M 5-FU, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5M leucovorin, 0.6\u00a0\u00b5M irinotecan, and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5M oxaliplatin was combined with CAP at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0min to characterize the cell cycle response.

                "Cholangiocarcinoma treatment research aims to improve available chemotherapeutic options and FOLFIRINOX is promising as a novel, effective, yet toxic treatment. A clinical goal now is to establish a standard FOLFIRINOX dosage based on clinical trials. Multiple phase 1 and 2 studies are underway with encouraging results for FOLFIRINOX treatment in different doses over gemcitabine plus cisplatin, however there is no standard. The early issues in these studies are toxicity of FOLFIRINOX and early triumphs show that the regimen can be safe in patients who are able to tolerate it. These trials attempt to minimize toxicities by reducing or modifying drug doses11,33.",
                "CAP is a promising therapy for CCA because of its in vitro selectivity of bile duct cancer cells25. In a CCA mouse xenograft model, the application of CAP on the tumor did not produce systemic side effects, and was selective in the tumor microenvironment25. Systemic risks have not been extensively studied in human clinical cases due to limited CAP use on patients. The lack of severe side effects in humans has been documented in one cohort of 20 patients with oral cancer34.",
                "Strategies for integrating CAP treatment and chemotherapy have been emerging through in vitro combination studies over the last few years. CAP has already been combined in vitro and in vivo with gemcitabine treatment, a standard option in CCA and pancreatic cancer regimens28,35. In malignant melanoma cells, 24-h pretreatment with oxaliplatin before 30\u00a0s of CAP treatment had an additive effect to toxicity26. Another report examined breast cancer cells incubated with drug loaded nanoparticles for 24 or 72\u00a0h before CAP and saw synergistic inhibition of cell growth compared to individual treatments alone27. Strategies for combination experiments in vitro are crucial to understanding the interactions between CAP and drug therapies. These reports support a combined anti-tumor effect, demonstrating that CAP has potential to increase anti-tumor effectiveness of current medicines.",
                "In this study, CAP generated by the CCPCS was combined with a FOLFIRINOX regimen to treat cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro as there exists a need to examine interactions between CAP and novel chemotherapeutics. This study demonstrates that both CAP and FOLFIRINOX individually and in combination effectively reduce cell viability suggesting that FOLFIRINOX dosage can be reduced if paired with CAP for the treatment of CCA. Synergy was seen through MTT assays at various doses of FOLFIRINOX and CAP (Table 2). Confocal microscopy and IncuCyte imaging demonstrated a decrease in cell counts and changes in cell morphology after treatment which was consistent with the reduction in viability shown in Fig.\u00a02.",
                "The underlying mechanism of these synergetic results remains unknown. FOLFIRINOX treatment in vivo includes administration of multiple doses that may not be completed due to toxicity resulting in a lower or incomplete regimen. Surgical resection for CCA may not be an option for late-stage diagnosis due to the high recurrence rate3,4. Combination treatment strategies could increase the efficacy of surgical options for patients. In the JCRI-ABTS phase I FDA Investigational Device Exemption Approval clinical trial (G190165/R001) of CCPCS36, CAP is sprayed across the tumor bed immediately following resection. Here in the tumor microenvironment, CAP would interact with residual tumor cells and normal tissue. In CCA cases where recurrence is a concern, CAP has the potential to target the remnant microscopic tumor. For other cancers with high recurrence, CAP may benefit current chemotherapy regimens. However, the synergy reported in this data is limited to an in vitro model. The efficacy of combination treatment could be altered by other factors in vivo.",
                "This is the first study to investigate the synergistic interaction between CAP and FOLFIRINOX for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Our finding of synergism between CAP and chemotherapeutics has great potential. CAP and FOLFIRINOX can be combined to reduce cholangiocarcinoma tumor cell viability and proliferation. We determined the dosage combinations in which viability reduction could be enhanced by adding 1\u20135\u00a0min of low temperature plasma to a low dose of FOLFIRINOX (6.7\u00a0\u00b5M fluorouracil, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5M leucovorin, 0.6\u00a0\u00b5M irinotecan, and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5M oxaliplatin). A combination therapy would be advantageous for patients where an intense FOLFIRINOX regimen is too aggressive, and this warrants further clinical research. We focused on the low doses of FOLFIRINOX to reduce overall chemotherapeutic burden in vitro as a model of lower toxicity in vivo. If a lower dose of FOLFIRINOX is administered, patients with low performance status can have more treatment options. Knowledge of the interactions between CAP and chemotherapeutics is of clinical value and can lead to more personalized medicine and a lower chemotherapy burden on patients in the future."

                "The effectiveness of Canady Helios Cold atmospheric plasma in combination with a FOLFIRINOX regimen was explored. We found that a combination treatment can be significantly more effective than either CAP or FOLFIRINOX alone in reducing cholangiocarcinoma cell viability. We are the first to demonstrate the in vitro synergistic effect of a FOLFIRINOX treatment and CAP, and our data suggests CAP could be a possible adjuvant therapy for cholangiocarcinoma. It is important that CAP alone can selectively induce tumor cell death, however our results demonstrate that CAP can potentially reduce the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs needed for cancer patients. Future studies may examine the cellular pathways involved in these synergistic characteristics and identify the ideal dose of treatment that has the lowest feasible toxicity with the most productive outcome. This study provides insights for the clinical application of CAP for cholangiocarcinoma cancer treatment."
