However, since there is no way for measuring the line parameters of an operating power facility until now, a state of the power facility is estimated and used by attaching a plurality of sensors to the power facility and sensing changes in temperature, pressure and vibration, a partial discharge phenomenon and the like, which are secondary physical phenomena generated from the changes in the line parameters of the facility.",

                        "In addition, since there is a time delay until the secondary physical phenomena generated by the changes in the power facility itself are appeared, there is a limit to some extent in monitoring an abnormal state of the facility, and, particularly, in the case of a transmission line installed across a wide area, a plurality of sensors is installed, and thus it is impractical since there are a lot of difficulties in maintenance.",
