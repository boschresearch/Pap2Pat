    "title": "A Study on the Condition Monitoring of Transmission Line by On-line Circuit Parameter Measurement",
    "date": "2013-08-22",
    "abstract": "An on-line condition monitoring method for transmission line is proposed using electrical circuit theory and IT technology in this paper. It is reasonable that the circuit parameters such as resistance (R), inductance (L), conductance (g) and capacitance (C) of a transmission line expose the electrical conditions and physical state of the line. Those parameters can be calculated from the linear equation composed of voltages and currents measured by synchro-phasor measurement technique at both end of the line. A set of linear voltage drop equations containing four terminal constants ( \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 D , C , B , A ) are mathematical models of the transmission line circuits. At least two sets of those linear equations are established from different operation condition of the line, they may mathematically yield those circuit parameters of the line. The conditions of line connectivity including state of connecting parts or contacting parts of the switching device may be monitored by resistance variations during operation. The insulation conditions of the line can be monitored by conductance (g) and capacitance (C) measurements. Together with other condition monitoring devices such as partial discharge, sensors and visual sensing device etc., they may give useful information to monitor out any incipient symptoms of faults. The prototype of hardware system has been developed and tested through laboratory level simulated transmission lines. The test has shown enough evident to put the proposed method to practical uses.

                "ECHNOLOGY of design and manufacturing for the electric power equipment has been much improved, however the fault still occurs in the power system during operation due to the defective parts or deteriorated part of the equipment, so that unexpected large scale power loss and damage on the power equipment are happen from time to time. Nowadays on the other hand, the higher qualities of electricity are required to the consumer therefore higher degree of power system integrity is needed. So that powerful on-line monitoring devices or tools for power system and power equipment are strongly recommended in order to anticipate before the fault or failure of the power equipment.",

                "A proposed method is a condition monitoring of the transmission line by measuring four circuit parameters R, L, g and C of the lines. This method could be implemented by a simple computerized operating unit to perform some arithmetical operation and synchronized voltage and current measuring units at both side of the line and communication channel between them. The circuit parameters of the transmission lines by this time, actually has not been measured by on-line measurement during operation, but been only measured by off-line testing or laboratory testing."
