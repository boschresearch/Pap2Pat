    "title": "Tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells dictate reduced survival in premenopausal estrogen receptor\u2013positive breast cancer",
    "date": "2022-02-08",
    "abstract": "CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved survival in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) yet have no association with survival in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC. The basis for these contrasting findings remains elusive. We identified subsets of BC tumors infiltrated by CD8+ T cells with characteristic features of exhausted T cells (TEX). Tumors with abundant CD8+ TEX exhibited a distinct tumor microenvironment marked by amplified interferon-\u03b3 signaling-related pathways and higher programmed death ligand 1 expression. Paradoxically, higher levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ TEX associated with decreased overall survival of patients with ER+ BC but not patients with TNBC. Moreover, high tumor expression of a CD8+ TEX signature identified dramatically reduced survival in premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, patients with ER+ BC. Finally, we demonstrated the value of a tumor TEX signature score in identifying high-risk premenopausal ER+ BC patients among those with intermediate Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Scores. Our data highlight the complex relationship between CD8+ TILs, interferon-\u03b3 signaling, and ER status in BC patient survival. This work identifies tumor-infiltrating CD8+ TEX as a key feature of reduced survival outcomes in premenopausal patients with early-stage ER+ BC.",

                "In most cancer types, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) denotes reduced risk for relapse and increased overall survival (1). The prognostic impact of CD8+ TILs appears to be subtype specific in breast cancer (BC) (2, 3). CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells positively associate with survival in triple-negative BC (TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) overexpressed (HER2+) BC, but not in estrogen receptor\u2013positive (ER+) BC (4\u20136). This paradox is further complicated by differences in kinetics of disease progression among BC subtypes. As compared with patients with TNBC, patients with ER+ BC rarely have early relapse events but have a higher overall relapse rate more than 5 years after diagnosis (7). A better understanding of the relationship between TILs and patient outcomes is needed to guide therapeutic strategies for patients with ER+ BC, who compose approximately 70% of all patients with BC (8).",
                "Progress in dissecting the complexity of CD8+ TIL heterogeneity has shed light on the role of specific T cell subsets in antitumor immunity. We and others have shown that primary tumor-infiltrating resident memory T cells, a subset of CD8+ T cells that localize within peripheral tissue without recirculation, positively associate with increased survival in patients with TNBC (9, 10). Tumor infiltration of granzyme B+CD8+ TILs and an interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) signature also denote favorable outcomes in patients with TNBC (11). However, a detailed understanding of the relationship between CD8+ TIL subsets and ER+ BC patient survival characteristics is still lacking.",
                "More recently, the relationship between antitumor immunity and a CD8+ T cell subset termed exhausted T cells (TEX) has become better understood. CD8+ TEX are generally described as cells with reduced production capacity of cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 (12). CD8+ TEX also express elevated levels of immune checkpoint molecules, including programmed death 1 (PD-1), TIM-3 (encoding T cell Ig and mucin domain-containing protein 3), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte\u2013associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) (13, 14). PD-1 \u201chigh\u201d expression by T cells has long been regarded as a marker of T cell dysfunction and more recently has been recognized as a surrogate marker for tumor specificity (15\u201317). We previously showed that PD-1+ functional cells predominate the CD8+ tumor infiltrate in most primary breast tumors (18). In addition to PD-1, expression of the ectoenzyme CD39 has been reported to reliably mark CD8+ TEX in both cancer and infectious disease settings (19, 20). It has been further demonstrated that PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TEX are tumor specific, are associated with good prognosis in head and neck cancer patients, and predict response to checkpoint blockade in lung cancer patients (21, 22). Together, these reports have defined CD8+ TEX as important mediators of antitumor immunity and biomarkers of clinical significance.",
                "Here, we show that tumor-infiltrating CD8+ TEX are detectable in a subset of both ER+ and TNBC tumors. We show that BC patient tumors enriched with CD8+ TEX have distinct tumor microenvironment (TME) immune composition and increased IFN-\u03b3\u2013related activity. We demonstrate a CD8+ TEX signature that delineates patients with ER+ BC with marked differences in overall survival. Intriguingly, we find that high CD8+ TEX tumor infiltration identifies a subset of premenopausal patients with ER+ BC with decreased overall survival and relapse-free survival. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of complementing Oncotype DX scoring with TEX signature scoring to identify high-risk premenopausal patients with ER+ BC. Together, these findings unravel what we believe are previously unidentified relationships between CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and patient prognosis and highlight CD8+ TEX as a critical feature of ER+ BC patient outcomes."

                        "We examined BC patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), tumor-negative tumor-draining lymph nodes (T\u2013 LNs), tumor-positive tumor-draining lymph nodes (T+ LNs), primary tumors, and noncancerous breast tissue (NCBT) by flow cytometry for the presence of CD8+ T cells expressing T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and CD39 (Figure 1A; gating strategy in Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.153963DS1). Among antigen-experienced (CD45RA\u2013) CD8+ T cells, PD-1+ cells were common in all tissues, but frequencies of PD-1+CD39+CD8+ T cells were highest in primary tumors, followed by T+ LNs (Figure 1B). PD-1+CD39+CD8+ T cells were rarely detected in PBMCs and never in NCBT. Notably, T+ LNs and T\u2013 LNs displayed no significant differences in frequencies of PD-1+CD39+CD8+ T cells. We observed high variability in the frequency of PD-1+CD39+ within CD8+ TILs and a higher frequency on average in TNBC tumors than ER+ tumors (Figure 1C). Overall, the frequency of PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs did not correlate with Ki-67 status, tumor size (pathological T status), or patient stage (Supplemental Figure 2). Higher grade ER+ tumors tended to have increased frequencies of PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs as compared with lower grade ER+ tumors, but this observation lacked statistical significance because of high interpatient variability.",
                        "We next set out to elucidate the relationship between PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs, TME features, and patient survival using a multiomics approach (Figure 1D). Further characterization of BC patient PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs\u2019 protein expression was performed by flow cytometry to determine if they met canonical definitions of T cell exhaustion. PD-1 levels were significantly higher on PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs relative to PD-1+CD39\u2013CD8+ TILs (Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 3A), identifying them as PD-1 \u201chigh\u201d CD8+ T cells described in other tumor types (15). Relative to other CD8+ TILs, higher percentages of PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs expressed molecules TIM-3, T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), 2B4, and CD38 (Figure 2, B\u2013E, and Supplemental Figure 3, B\u2013E). Similarly, higher percentages of PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs expressed resident memory markers CD69 and CD103 as compared with other CD8+ TILs (Figure 2, F and G, and Supplemental Figure 3, F and G).",
                        "We then confirmed PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs as functionally exhausted compared with other CD8+ TILs by examining their capacity to produce effector cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 (Figure 2, H\u2013J, and Supplemental Figure 3H). PD-1+CD39\u2013 and PD-1\u2013CD39\u2013CD8+ TILs displayed no differences in IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, or IL-2 production capacity, highlighting our previous findings that PD-1 expression alone does not identify an exhausted phenotype (18). In contrast, PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs demonstrated marked loss in production capacity of both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2, while mostly retaining IFN-\u03b3 production capacity. Such functional data formally identify PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs in human breast tumors as CD8+ TEX with similar functional and phenotypic profiles of TEX described by others in the context of other cancer malignancies and chronic disease settings (16, 17, 21, 22).",
                        "Next, we examined expression of proteins CD127 (IL-7R\u03b1) and killer cell lectin like receptor G1 (KLRG1) to assess PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs for evidence of terminal differentiation (Figure 2K and Supplemental Figure 3I). CD127 expression is critical for homeostatic proliferation and maintenance of memory T cells, while KLRG1 expression signifies an effector T cell status (23). Loss of both CD127 and KLRG1 has been associated with a severe T cell exhaustion phenotype (24, 25). PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs primarily displayed a CD127\u2013KLRG1\u2013 phenotype. Comparatively, both PD-1+CD39\u2013 and PD-1\u2013CD39\u2013CD8+ TILs contained cell populations with mixed expression of CD127 and KLRG1. Taken together this phenotyping illustrates PD-1+CD39+CD8+ TILs found in BC tumors as highly activated cells with both exhausted and tissue residency characteristics."

                        "CD8+ T cell exhaustion has been demonstrated as a transcriptionally and epigenetically discrete functional state in various disease settings (26\u201329). To assess this in the context of BC, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing of patient CD8+ T cells from 10 patients with BC, including 9 primary tumors, 2 T+ LNs, 3 NCBTs, and 7 matched PBMC samples (Supplemental Figure 4). CD8+ T cells stained for PD-1, CD39, CD103, CD69, CD137, and CCR7 were single-cell index sorted for downstream whole-transcriptome analysis. Unbiased Seurat cluster analysis found CD8+ T cells to be composed of 4 major clusters with discrete gene expression patterns (Figure 3, A and B). As expected, PD-1+CD39+ T cells occupied a unique cluster, while surprisingly PD-1+CD39\u2013 and PD-1\u2013CD39\u2013 were indiscriminately found in all other T cell clusters and showed no major differences in gene expression (Figure 3, C and D).",
                        "Cell surface protein expression information collected by index sorting was then used to annotate the 4 CD8+ T cell clusters as TEX (PD-1+CD39+), resident effector memory T cells (CD39\u2013, CD103+, CD69+), effector memory T cells (CD39\u2013, CD103+/\u2013, CD69+/\u2013), and central memory T cells (CCR7+) (Figure 3E). CD137 was found almost exclusively in the exhausted T cell cluster. CD103 and CD69 expression across several clusters suggests the potential acquisition of a CD103+CD69+ phenotype as T cells transition through these phenotypes. Unsurprisingly, the CCR7-expressing central memory T cell cluster was largely identified in PBMC-derived T cells.",
                        "Analysis of gene expression differences between clusters revealed several key differences between T cell populations. The central memory T cell cluster, mostly of PBMC origin, expressed genes related to proliferation capacity (PASK, IL16) and antiapoptosis (BIRC2), along with the memory T cell\u2013associated gene S100A6 (30). The activated effector memory T cell cluster expressed genes linked to T cell activation (LMNA, ANXA1), effector function (FGFBP2, KLRB1), and T cell trafficking (SELL, KLF2) (31, 32). Intriguingly, the resident effector memory T cluster demonstrated highly differentiated upregulation of histone genes and regulatory elements (SERTAD1, ZNF331) that may play a role in cell cycle regulation. The resident effector memory T cell cluster also displayed upregulated GZMK, in contrast with GZMB and PRF1 upregulation in the exhausted T cell cluster. This observed T cell subset\u2013specific granzyme utilization likely reflects T cell differentiation stage\u2013specific changes in granzyme expression profiles observed by others (33). Finally, the exhausted T cell cluster showed transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with increased cytolytic activation (GZMB, PRF1), T cell activation (HLA-DRA), IFN response elements (IFI6, MX1, IFI27), and the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13. Additionally, we observed downregulation of activator protein 1 complex molecules JUNB and FOS; downregulation of these genes has been shown by others to mark chronically activated TEX (34, 35).",
                        "We next generated an exhausted T cell gene signature composed of genes significantly elevated in TEX relative to other CD8+ T cell populations. Log2 fold changes of genetic markers were considered the weights in the signature. Our exhausted T cell gene signature contains 25 genes, including CXCL13, GZMB, IFI6, HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DRB5, PRF1, and MX1. The full gene signature and relative gene fold changes are shown in Supplemental Table 3. We then compared our exhausted T cell gene expression signature to exhausted T cell gene signatures produced by other groups using GSEA. We found that our exhausted T cell signature shared significant similarities to those identified from lung cancer and melanoma TILs (Figure 3, F and G) (21, 36). We also verified that our exhausted T cell gene signature had significant overlap with those produced in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus murine models of T cell exhaustion (Supplemental Figure 5) (35, 37). Thus, the transcriptional signature of TEX in patients with BC shared common features to both those seen in other disease states and classically defined TEX. Together our single-cell data confirm CD8+ TEX as an activated, transcriptionally distinct CD8+ TIL population that has likely clonally expanded in response to cognate tumor antigens."

                        "Given that CD8+ TEX identified in BC patient tumors displayed a highly activated phenotype and largely retained the capacity to produce IFN-\u03b3, we next asked how their presence correlated with differences in TME features. ER+ tumors with known fractions of CD8+ TEX as identified by flow cytometry were curated into TEX \u201chigh\u201d (TEXhi) and TEX \u201clow\u201d (TEXlo) tumors as defined by above and below the overall median for percentage TEX of CD8+ TILs (8%), respectively. Pathologist assessment of CD8, CD20, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was then performed on these tumors with immunohistochemistry-stained slides (Figure 4A). CD8+ T cell infiltration was higher in several, but not all, TEXhi tumors (Figure 4B). In contrast, CD20+ B cell infiltration was higher in the majority of TEXhi tumors (Figure 4C). Although PD-L1 expression was found to be highly variable in samples, strikingly, all tumors with stroma scoring PD-L1+ of 5% or higher were found in TEXhi tumors (Figure 4D).",
                        "ER+ tumors with known abundance of CD8+ TEX from flow cytometry were assessed with the NanoString nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel for immune cell composition and differential gene expression. CD8+ TEX in tumors correlated with higher abundance of a variety of immune subsets, including B cells, overall CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, Tregs, and CD56dim NK cells as identified by standard NanoString signatures (Figure 4E). Given the association between activated T cells, IFN-\u03b3 production, and PD-L1 expression in the TME, we assessed the expression of the previously reported \u201ctumor inflammation signature,\u201d which is mainly composed of IFN-\u03b3\u2013regulated genes (38). Several of these genes were significantly correlated with the presence of CD8+ TEX, including CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9, STAT1, CD274 (PD-L1), and LAG3 (Figure 4F). Interestingly, CD276 and CXCL2 expression was not positively correlated with CD8+ TEX. Other genes significantly upregulated in TEXhi tumors included IFNG itself, TARP, GNLY, MX1, and TAP2. Notably, genes SPP1, CCL28, CXCL3, SELE, and CCL26 were all decreased in TEXhi tumors (Figure 4G).",
                        "To expand on our tissue-based observations of TEXhi and TEXlo ER+ tumors, we turned to the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) public data source for gene expression analysis in a larger cohort of BC tumors (39). We designated ER+ tumors as TEXhi (top 25%) and TEXlo (bottom 25%) based on expression of our exhausted T cell gene signature derived from single-cell sequencing and performed differential gene expression analysis. TEXhi tumors demonstrated significantly increased expression of numerous genes involved in immune surveillance and activation marked by increased expression of allograft rejection, inflammatory response, and interferon response Hallmark pathways (Supplemental Figure 6). In concurrence with NanoString analysis of our own tumor samples, these included IFN-\u03b3 signaling genes STAT1, CXCL10, and IDO1; antigen presentation molecules HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1; important T cell molecules GZMB and IL7R; and B cell\u2013related molecules CD79A and CXCL13. Next, we utilized CIBERSORTx to interrogate differences in immune composition between TEXhi and TEXlo tumors by assessing relative abundance of various immune populations (40). Notably, TEXhi tumors were composed of higher fractions of M1 macrophages, NK cells, \u03b3/\u03b4 T cells, and CD8+ T cells (Figure 4H). In comparison, TEXlo tumors were composed of higher fractions of M2 macrophages, M0 macrophages, mast cells, and naive B cells. In summary, TEXhi tumors display an \u201cinflamed tumor\u201d phenotype, with upregulation of numerous IFN-\u03b3\u2013associated genes, increased chemokines, antigen presentation\u2013related molecules, and antitumor immune subsets, such as M1 macrophages, NK cells, and effector CD8+ T cells."

                        "We next aimed to unravel the relationship between CD8+ TEX, BC tumor characteristics, and patient outcomes within the METABRIC data set. As expected, increased expression of CD8A was found in TNBC tumors compared with ER+ tumors (Figure 5A). We next found signature scores for TEX were higher in TNBC tumors as compared with ER+ tumors (Figure 5B), as also observed in our flow cytometry data. In line with these observations, PAM50 molecular classification of tumors demonstrated that exhausted T cell signatures were highest in basal tumors and slightly higher in luminal B tumors than luminal A tumors (Supplemental Figure 7A). As tumor-infiltrating TEX have been shown to be specific for somatic mutation\u2013derived neoantigens, we next investigated if increased tumor mutation burden coincided with increased TEX in patients with BC (41). Surprisingly, within both TNBC and ER+ METABRIC cohorts, TEXhi tumors had a statistically significant decreased number of somatic mutations detected (Supplemental Figure 7, B and C). However, the difference in mean mutation burden between TEXhi and TEXlo tumors was only 2 somatic variations. To confirm the lack of association between TEX infiltration and high tumor mutation burden, we next performed tumor mutation load (TML) analysis on our own ER+ tumor tissues using a targeted TML panel. Again, observed TML did not correlate in any way with the TEX frequencies of CD8+ TILs identified by flow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 7D). Taken together, these observations suggest that increased levels of TEX CD8+ TILs in patients with BC cannot necessarily be accounted for by increased tumor mutation burden, although we do not discount the possibility that TEX CD8+ TILs may be neoantigen specific.",
                        "CD8A expression and TEX signature expression showed a modest positive correlation in both TNBC (R = 0.6) and ER+ (R = 0.5) METABRIC tumors, revealing that high levels of CD8+ TEX could be found in tumors with both high and low levels of CD8+ T cells (Figure 5, C and D). To investigate potential divergent contributions of overall CD8+ T cell infiltration and CD8+ TEX infiltration, we stratified ER+ and TNBC tumors into CD8hi or CD8lo and TEXhi or TEXlo based on top 25% and bottom 25% cutoffs (Supplemental Figure 7, E, F, H, and I). As expected, TNBC patients with CD8hi tumors had marked increases in survival as compared with those with CD8lo tumors (Figure 5E). However, in ER+ BC, patients with CD8hi tumors and CD8lo tumors demonstrated no differences in survival (Figure 5F). TNBC patients with TEXhi (top 25%) tumors had no improved survival relative to those with TEXlo (bottom 25%) tumors (Figure 5G). In stark contrast, ER+ patients with TEXhi tumors had significantly reduced survival (Figure 5H).",
                        "We next set out to reconcile our observations regarding CD8+ TEX and overall CD8+ T cell infiltration by assessing survival in the context of both variables. For survival analysis in the context of both CD8+ T cells and TEX, we further stratified tumors into 4 groups: CD8hiTEXhi, CD8hiTEXlo, CD8loTEXhi, and CD8loTEXlo (Supplemental Figure 7, G and J). Patients with TNBC with CD8hiTEXhi and CD8hiTEXlo tumors demonstrated the best survival (Figure 5I). Strikingly, ER+ patients with CD8hiTEXlo and CD8loTEXlo tumors demonstrated the best survival (Figure 5J). We next performed multivariate analysis of these gene signatures to confirm our observed contrast in the contribution of CD8+ T cell infiltration and exhausted T cell infiltration to survival in patients with TNBC and ER+ BC. In patients with TNBC increased overall survival was primarily driven by increased CD8A expression and to a lesser degree expression of TEX (Figure 5K). In patients with ER+ BC, again survival had no association with CD8A expression and significantly decreased as expression of TEX increased (Figure 5L). For context we compared hazard ratios to gene expression of CD3G and PTPRC (CD45). We found our exhausted T cell signature to be more predictive of outcome than immune (PTPRC) or T cell infiltration levels alone (CD3G or CD8A) in patients with ER+ BC.",
                        "Increased expression of IFN response genes has been associated with worse patient outcomes in ER+ BC (42). We continued to explore the relationship between tumor IFN signaling, the presence of TEX, and survival in patients with ER+ BC. In METABRIC patients with ER+ BC, we found a strong correlation between the IFN-\u03b3 tumor signature and our exhausted T cell signature (Supplemental Figure 8A). In comparing TEXhi and TEXlo ER+ BC tumors by differential gene expression, several of the most upregulated genes in TEXhi tumors were involved in IFN-\u03b3 signaling and response, including CXCL10, CXCL9, IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, ISG15, MX1, OAS1, OASL, and STAT1 (Supplemental Figure 8B). We then assessed these IFN-\u03b3\u2013associated genes within cancer cells specifically by using internal single-cell sequencing data from ER+ BC tumors in which we knew the fraction of TEX CD8+ TILs as determined by flow cytometry. Again, we categorized tumors as TEXhi and TEXlo by being above or below the overall median for percentage TEX of CD8+ TILs (8%). All the 14 IFN-\u03b3\u2013associated genes we examined, with the exception of CXCL9, were found to be significantly elevated in cancer cells within TEXhi tumors (Supplemental Figure 8C). Finally, a hazard ratio analysis of patients with ER+ BC found a significantly increased risk for lower survival with increased tumor expression of IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, ISG15, MX1, OAS1, and OASL (Supplemental Figure 8D). In summary, we identify a strong connection between TEX CD8+ TILs, IFN-\u03b3 signaling in BC cells, and reduced overall survival in patients with ER+ BC."

Hallmark pathway analysis similarly found increased expression of several immune-related pathways in ER+ tumors, including allograft rejection, interferon responses, and inflammatory responses (Figure 6A). Intriguingly, our analysis of TEXhi ER+ tumors also identified increased expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and decreased expression of early estrogen response genes, potentially suggesting an association between TEX CD8+ TILs and more aggressive tumor features (Figure 6, B and C). Indeed, within the ER+ METABRIC cohort, we found that exhausted T cell signatures generally increased in ER+ tumors as the grade of the tumor increased, although high expression of TEX was still identified in both grade 1 and grade 2 tumors (Figure 6D). Furthermore, exhausted T cell signatures were increased in ER+ tumors with either Basal or Luminal B PAM50 subclassification and tended to have diminished progesterone receptor expression (Supplemental Figure 9, A and B). Importantly, we also found that as compared with TEXlo ER+ tumors, TEXhi ER+ tumors had a significantly increased proliferation signature (Figure 6E). No associations were identified between the presence of TEX CD8+ TILs, patient stage, tumor size, menopause state, or age (Supplemental Figure 9, C\u2013F).",
                        "Given the findings of a more aggressive tumor phenotype in TEXhi ER+ tumors, including decreased estrogen response\u2013related gene expression, we hypothesized that survival characteristics may be different in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with ER+ BC. Using the menopausal status as defined by METABRIC (cutoff of 50 years old), we separately examined overall survival and relapse-free survival in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with ER+ BC. In postmenopausal women, overall survival trended to be reduced in patients with TEXhi tumors (Figure 6F). However, no significant differences in relapse-free survival were found (Figure 6G). Similarly, dividing postmenopausal tumors into CD8hiTEXhi, CD8hiTEXlo, CD8loTEXhi, and CD8loTEXlo did not distinguish significant survival differences (Figure 6H). On the other hand, premenopausal women with TEXhi tumors had dramatically reduced overall survival and relapse-free survival as compared with premenopausal women with TEXlo tumors (Figure 6, I and J). Further analysis of CD8hiTEXhi, CD8hiTEXlo, CD8loTEXhi, and CD8loTEXlo groups showed again that diminished survival was strictly associated with a TEXhi phenotype, regardless of being CD8hi or CD8lo (Figure 6K). As clinical presentation of premenopausal and postmenopausal women may vary, we repeated and validated our survival findings in grade 1 and 2 only ER+ patients and stage 4\u2013excluded ER+ patients (Supplemental Figure 10). Within premenopausal patients, TEXhi tumors were increasingly composed of higher grade and Luminal B, HER2+, and basal molecular subset tumors, highlighting heterogeneity in the features of TEXhi tumors (Figure 6, L and M). More striking was a highly increased proliferation signature in premenopausal TEXhi tumors as compared with premenopausal TEXlo tumors (Figure 6N). A hazard ratio analysis of survival risk imparted by our TEX signature identified women aged 35\u201345 as a group with the lowest overall survival and that survival risk associated with TEX steadily declined with age (Figure 6O). Together these findings connect significantly reduced survival in younger premenopausal women that can be defined by high infiltration of TEX CD8+ TILs."

                        "Additional biomarkers to guide clinical care of patients with early-stage ER+ BC are needed. Gene expression testing to evaluate risk of recurrence is now standard of care for patients with early-stage BC. A prominent example of such gene expression testing is the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (BRS). Currently, treatment strategies for ER+ BC patients with intermediate BRSs are less clear. With this in mind, we next hypothesized that added stratification of ER+ tumors by our TEX signature could provide additional prognostication value in the context of patients with intermediate Oncotype DX BRS.",
                        "Without exact BRSs available, we utilized the gene expression of the Oncotype DX 21-gene assay to calculate a BRS signature (43). TEX signature expression and relative BRS were weakly associated (R = 0.3) in all, postmenopausal only, or premenopausal only METABRIC ER+ patients (Supplemental Figure 11). We did, however, observe that TEXhi tumors appeared to be a subset of tumors with an intermediate BRS, suggesting that the TEX signature could be used to further segregate these patients into distinct survival outcomes.",
                        "To investigate this, we next defined METABRIC ER+ patients as having a high (top 15%) Oncotype DX BRS (OncDXhi), intermediate (middle 70%) Oncotype DX BRS (OncDXint), or low (bottom 15%) Oncotype DX BRS (OncDXlo) based on observable distributions among patients and published frequencies of these clinical phenotypes (44). Within postmenopausal OncDXint patients, TEXhi and TEXlo tumors did not display significant differences in overall survival or relapse-free survival (Figure 7, A and B). Additionally, multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of TEX signature expression on overall survival (Figure 7C). In contrast, within premenopausal OncDXint patients, patients with TEXhi tumors demonstrated significantly reduced overall survival and relapse-free survival as compared with those with TEXlo tumors (Figure 7, D and E). Multivariate analysis further showed that increased TEX signature expression significantly associated with decreased overall survival and more so than patient age, tumor grade, tumor size, or even Oncotype DX BRS in premenopausal OncDXint patients (Figure 7F).",
                        "We next performed a stepwise model selection to prune the multivariate analysis to estimate hazard ratios for survival (Supplemental Figure 12). To ensure that the influence of our TEX signature was associated with survival independently of overall immune and T cell infiltration, we also included gene expression of CD8A, CD3G, and PTPRC in addition to patient age, tumor grade, tumor size, and LN status. Of all variables, TEX was found to be the most influential for both overall survival and relapse-free survival.",
                        "For overall survival, each additional unit of TEX signature was associated with a 91% (P value = 0.03) increase in risk for OncDXint patients. For relapse-free survival, each additional unit of TEX signature was associated with a 76% (P value = 0.01) for OncDXint patients.",
                        "Our findings demonstrated the value of using our TEX signature to further prognosticate OncDXint patients. We therefore next examined patient survival characteristics in the context of 4 subgroups distilled from Oncotype DX BRS and TEX signature expression: OncDXhi, OncDXint + TEXlo, OncDXint + TEXhi, and OncDXlo. In postmenopausal patients, OncDXhi patients and OncDXlo patients had the shortest and longest survival outcomes, respectively, but OncDXint + TEXhi patients did not demonstrate significantly different survival characteristics from OncDXint + TEXlo patients (Figure 7, G and H). In premenopausal patients, OncDXhi patients again had the shortest survival outcomes, but OncDXint + TEXhi patients demonstrated dramatically decreased survival characteristics as compared with OncDXint + TEXlo patients (Figure 7, I and J). Surprisingly, OncDXint + TEXlo patients had remarkably similar survival characteristics to OncDXlo patients. These findings establish a TEX signature as a useful means to further segregate high-risk and low-risk patients within premenopausal OncDXint patients."

                "In this study, we showed that CD8+ TEX occur within a subset of human breast tumors. These CD8+ TEX were identified by distinct phenotypic properties, including PD-1 and CD39 coexpression, increased checkpoint molecule expression, reduced CD127 expression, and reduced cytokine production capacity. Single-cell sequencing revealed that CD8+ TEX in patients with BC are transcriptionally unique. Furthermore, we showed that increased presence of CD8+ TEX occurs in immunologically distinct tumors with increased expression of IFN-\u03b3\u2013related genes, including PD-L1. We showed that despite signs of increased immune activation, ER+ BC patients with a high CD8+ TEX signature experienced decreased survival. Survival was found to be most dramatically reduced in premenopausal patients with ER+ BC, identifying an important connection between antitumor immunity and menopausal status. Last, we demonstrated the clinical utility in using our TEX signature to identify premenopausal OncDXint patients with decreased survival outcomes.",
                "BC tumors, which predominantly have a low mutation burden, are widely viewed as nonimmunogenic (45). We found that CD8+ TEX can be identified in a subset of both TNBC and ER+ breast tumors, suggesting tumor antigen recognition even in ER+ tumors. Phenotyping of these TEX corroborates robust activation and clonal expansion in response to antigen. Tumor immunogenicity is generally thought to be correlated with increased tumor mutation burden and the resulting neoantigen-driven T cell reactivity to cancer cells (46, 47). Indeed, tumor neoantigen\u2013specific and exhausted CD8+ T cells have been described (48). Somewhat surprisingly, we did not find a correlation between the presence of CD8+ TEX TILs and tumor mutation burden. These findings do not preclude the possibility that CD8+ TEX in patients with BC are neoantigen specific and highlight the need for further work to dissect antigen specificity in BC.",
                "Our data connect the presence of CD8+ TEX with an IFN-\u03b3\u2013rich TME and reduced survival in patients with ER+ BC. Other groups have also found evidence for immune activation in ER+ breast tumors. Wagner et al. showed that increased frequencies of PD-1+CD38+CD8+ T cells, which we demonstrate as CD8+ TEX, correlate with the presence of PD-L1+ tumor-associated macrophages in high-grade ER+ tumors (49). Mirroring our CD8+ TEX signature analysis, Thorsson et al. demonstrated IFN-\u03b3 signature\u2013enriched tumors to be most frequent in TNBC, followed by luminal B BC and then luminal A BC (50). We find that increased TEX associated with reduced overall survival in patients with ER+ BC but not TNBC. This further depicts ER+ BC and TNBC as having substantially different features of immune-cancer interaction. Standard-of-care therapy, average time to relapse, and cancer cell biology are clearly different between these BC subsets and may play a role in these differential outcomes (51). Further studies exploring the development of CD8+ TEX in the context of BC neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy regimens may reveal mechanisms for the survival characteristic differences between patients with ER+ BC and TNBC.",
                "Increased IFN-\u03b3 in the TME is generally considered to reflect an active antitumor immune response beneficial to patient outcomes. However, we demonstrate that high levels of CD8+ TEX and IFN-\u03b3 denoted poor outcomes in patients with ER+ BC, most significantly in premenopausal patients in which circulating estrogen levels are highest (52). Our evidence therefore lends support to other findings of the potential protumorigenic role of IFN-\u03b3 signaling (53). In support of this, increased expression of IFN response genes and JAK/STAT signaling genes has been found in both chemotherapy- and tamoxifen-resistant ER+ tumors (42, 54, 56). Additionally, phosphorylated STAT1 has been shown to be increased in premenopausal ER+ BC patients with worse survival (56). Although the exact mechanism for the relationship between increased tumorigenesis and IFN signaling in ER+ tumors is not yet clear, there is evidence that STAT1 and ER signaling may synergize for enhanced cancer cell proliferation (57). Our results suggest that tumor-infiltrating CD8+ TEX may therefore inadvertently yield a rich source of IFN-\u03b3 in the TME that is protumorigenic and prometastatic in the context of ER+ BC tumors. We demonstrate evidence for this by finding strong correlations between TEX, increased tumor proliferation, increased tumor grade, and decreased survival in patients with ER+ BC. A novel therapeutic strategy that targets IFN signaling may be a viable approach for TEXhi ER+ BC (58).",
                "Standard of care for patients with early-stage ER+ BC is currently guided by hormone receptor expression, pathological tumor features, and genomic testing, such as the Oncotype DX BRS (59). Patients with high Oncotype DX BRSs have significantly increased risk of relapse and benefit from chemotherapy intervention (43). However, treatment strategies for approximately 70% of ER+ BC patients with intermediate Oncotype DX BRSs are less clear, and clinical outcomes differ further between premenopausal and postmenopausal women (60). Here, we demonstrate the use of TEX gene signature to further select for high-risk patients among those categorized as premenopausal and OncDXint. Our results suggest that early-stage premenopausal OncDXint TEXhi patients are a high-risk cohort that may benefit from adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapies. Future preclinical and clinical studies are needed to dissect the relationship between CD8+ TEX, metastasis development, and response to therapy in the context of both hormone receptor status and menopausal status."

                        "FFPE tissue samples were sectioned at a thickness of 5 \u03bcm, baked, and placed on positively charged glass slides. Slides were loaded on a Ventana DISCOVERY ULTRA (Ventana Medical Systems, Roche Diagnostics) automated IHC staining machine for deparaffinization, rehydration, endogenous peroxidase activity inhibition, and antigen retrieval (pH 8.5). Antigens were sequentially detected and heat inactivation was used to prevent antibody cross-reactivity between the same species. Following each primary antibody incubation (CD8, clone SP57; PD-L1, clone SP263; CD20, clone L26), DISCOVERY anti-Rabbit HQ or DISCOVERY anti-Mouse HQ and DISCOVERY anti-HQ-HRP were incubated. The stains were then visualized with DISCOVERY ChromoMap DAB Kit, DISCOVERY Teal Kit, and DISCOVERY Purple Kit, respectively; counterstained with hematoxylin (Ventana); and sealed with coverslips. Slides were imaged using the Vectra 3 automated quantitative pathology imaging system (Akoya Biosciences). Slides were then scored for percentage tumor stroma infiltration by a board-certified pathologist. In order to normalize percentage TEX infiltration abundance for NanoString analysis in Figure 4, percentage TEX of tumor tissues was calculated as follows: (FACS %TEX) \u00d7 (IHC %CD8)."
