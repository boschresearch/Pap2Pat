                "The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is a spin-spin interaction that has finite values only in systems lacking inversion symmetry. Dzyaloshinskii proposed that the combination of low symmetry and spin-orbit coupling gives rise to an antisymmetric exchange interaction (1), and Moriya introduced how to calculate the antisymmetric exchange interaction for localized magnetic systems in a microscopic model (2). This picture was later used to successfully explain helical spin order and skyrmion lattices in the B20-type transition metal silicides and germanides lacking inversion symmetry (3,4). In addition, Fert and Levy (5) proposed a DMI mechanism that involves magnetic and nonmagnetic sites in spin glasses, which was extended to thin film surfaces and interfaces where inversion symmetry breaks along the surface normal direction (6).",
                "This DMI mechanism is now invoked to explain the stability of preferred chirality in a large variety of systems featuring noncollinear spin textures, such as spin spirals (7), skyrmions (8)(9)(10), or chiral domain walls (DWs) (11)(12)(13). Its energy term, -D ij \u2022 (S i \u00d7 S j ), indicates that the sign of the DMI vector D ij determines the chirality of spin textures, i.e., being right-or left-handed, and the interplay between the magnitude of DMI and other magnetic interactions influences the lateral size of spin textures (10). Intense experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to explore the material dependence of the interfacial DMI and to exploit the flexibility of interface choices and stacking orders to enhance the effective DMI, with the goal of optimizing thin film and multilayer systems for the design of spinorbitronic devices (8)(9)(10)14) based on chiral spin textures.",
                "Experimentally, most studies on interfacial DMI systems have focused on magnetic layers adjacent to heavy metals in the framework of the Fert-Levy model, such as hafnium (15), tantalum (15)(16)(17), tungsten (7,15,17,18), iridium (19)(20)(21), platinum (17,(19)(20)(21), palladium (22), or ruthenium (23), where large differences of the DMI magnitude among those elements were attributed to the distinct degree of hybridization between 5d and 3d orbitals near the Fermi level (17,24). Sizable DMI has also been found at certain metal/ oxide interfaces, such as Co 90 Fe 10 /oxide (25), CoFeB/TaO x (26), Co/ AlO x , or Co/GdO x (27). These results point out the correlation between the DMI and the orbital angular momentum (25) and suggest the origin of the voltage-tunable DMI to be the Rashba field at metal/ oxide interfaces (26), which was recently predicted (28). In addition, it is fundamentally interesting to explore the effects of elements with a low atomic number on the DMI. For instance, hydrogenationinduced skyrmion formation in Fe/Ir(111) at low temperatures has been reported (29). Furthermore, a large DMI was observed at the Co/graphene interface, which was attributed to the Rashba effect (23,30). DMI induced by oxygen chemisorption on Fe films, different from the aforementioned oxide systems, has also been theoretically predicted with the DMI mechanism related to the hybridization and charge transfer between atomic oxygen and metal (31). Chemisorbed oxygen on a 3d metal surface is an ideal system to test this picture, as well as the recent theoretical prediction of the relation between the DMI and the electric dipole moment (32), as the presence of atomic oxygen creates a strong internal electric field at the atomic oxygen/metal interface, because of the large difference of electronegativity between oxygen and 3d ferromagnets (oxygen has a Pauling electronegativity of 3.44, and 3d ferromagnets have a Pauling electronegativity of ~1.90), yet such experimental examinations are still missing so far.",
                "Here, we report the direct observation of a large DMI induced at room temperature by chemisorbed oxygen on Ni/Co/Pd/W(110) multilayers, using spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SPLEEM) (33). We first show that the effective DMI in the multilayer stack can be tuned by precisely controlling the Pd spacer layer thickness, d Pd , which is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Then, we monitor the oxygen coverage (d O )-dependent evolution of DW chirality in perpendicularly magnetized Ni/Co films on Pd/W(110). We find that the chemisorbed oxygen can switch the DW chirality when the effective DMI of the bare (oxygen-free) Ni/ Co/Pd/W(110) multilayer is Pd-like (left-handed), as a result of a relatively thick Pd spacer layer, but chemisorbed oxygen cannot switch the DW chirality when the Pd spacer layer is thinner and the effective DMI of the bare multilayer is tungsten-like (right-handed). A systematic measurement of the chirality in d Pdd O space allows us to quantify the DMI induced by chemisorbed oxygen. We find that the magnitude of the chemisorbed oxygen-induced DMI is comparable to those induced at ferromagnet/heavy metal interfaces, despite the low atomic number of oxygen. We demonstrate that this oxygen-induced DMI is sufficiently strong to tailor a skyrmion's winding number as well as its domain wall type at room temperature. The observed large magnitude of the DMI induced by oxygen may be useful for the development of applications in the field of spintronics and magneto-ionics."

                                "One of the approaches to quantify the DMI in a layered system is to measure the DW spin texture as a function of layer thickness, where the sign and magnitude of the DMI can be determined by measuring the critical thickness where DW transitions from chiral N\u00e9el to achiral Bloch textures (10). This can be done by using SPLEEM (13,19,23) or scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (34). If the addition of a new interface with unknown DMI to a layered system with calibrated DMI is found to switch the handedness of DWs, then the unknown DMI of the new interface can be quantified by comparison. For example, the observation of righthanded chirality in Co/Ru(0001) and left-handed chirality in graphene/ Co/Ru(0001) allowed unambiguous determination of left-handed DMI at the graphene/Co interface (23). The aim to generalize this experimental method motivates the development of DMI-tunable platforms that combine pairs of buried interfaces with opposite DMI (19,35) to provide magnetic surfaces with either left-or right-handed DW chirality, so that the sign of an unknown DMI at any new interface added to the structure can be unambiguously determined.",
                                "In this work, tungsten and palladium are chosen because the growth of Pd on W(110) results in high-quality epitaxial films (fig. S1). The strong LEEM image intensity oscillations associated with the layer-by-layer growth allow a precise determination of the Pd film thickness, which permits fine-tuning of the effective DMI in the Pd/W system. Ni/Co bilayers grown on top provide perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which allows the observation of DW chirality (19). The compound SPLEEM images (Fig. 1, A, C, andE) show the Pd thickness-dependent switching of the DW N\u00e9el chirality in Ni/ Co/Pd/W(110) multilayers. The histograms (Fig. 1, B, D, andF) of the angle \uf061 calculated from the SPLEEM images show the statistics of DW chirality (19,23). Note that the DW is aligned along the easy axis of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, i.e., the W[001] direction; this alignment is induced by the uniaxial strain in face-centered cubic (fcc) layers on W(110) (18). Therefore, the DW type (N\u00e9el, Bloch, or mixed wall) varies on the basis of the DW orientation with respect to the tungsten crystal orientation. While this may result in shifted peaks in the \uf061 histogram away from 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, the sensitivity of the N\u00e9el-component to the interfacial DMI persists (18). The d Pd -dependent chirality evolution (Fig. 1G (thick d Pd ) N\u00e9el chirality occurs near d Pd = 2.5 monolayers (MLs) (Materials and Methods). This chirality switching is attributed to the sign change of the effective DMI, which is supported by DFT calculations (Fig. 1H), where the W-like DMI is right-handed and the Pd-like DMI is left-handed. This tunable DMI, by simply varying the Pd thickness, provides an ideal platform to the quantitative study of the interface-induced DMI."

                                "Ni( 111) is an ideal surface to study the role of oxygen on the DMI, as the phase diagram of oxygen chemisorbed on Ni(111) is well understood from literature (36). Two-dimensional O/Ni(111) adsorbate layers can be realized in the range of 0 to 0.5 ML oxygen with respect to the planar atomic density of Ni(111), where oxygen atoms strongly bind to threefold hollow sites on the Ni(111) surface with an oxygen-nickel bond length of 1.88 \u00c5. At room temperature, the oxygen layer remains in a \"lattice gas phase\" (no long-range order) at a low coverage below 0.21 ML, as the interaction energy between the oxygen adatoms is an order of magnitude smaller than the binding energy (36) S2].",
                                "In this work, we focus on room temperature oxygen adsorption in the coverage regime up to 0.29 ML, where no formation of NiO is observed (see Materials and Methods) (36).",
                                "We find that the presence of adsorbed oxygen on Ni/Co/Pd/W(110) samples favors right-handed chirality. This is unambiguously demonstrated by using the tunability of the DMI in this multilayer, where the chirality of the magnetic layer can be adjusted from left-handed to achiral to right-handed, as a function of the thickness of the Pd spacer.  2H for d Pd = 2.60 ML, 2.76 ML, and 2.83 ML. This is because the effective left-handed DMI increases with the Pd layer thickness (19,37), and more O coverage is required to provide the balancing right-handed DMI. The role of the chemisorbed oxygen-induced DMI is also examined in systems without heavy metal, where the chirality switching from left-handed chiral N\u00e9el wall to achiral Bloch wall is observed in [Co/Ni] 3 /Cu(111) with 0.21 ML chemisorbed oxygen (fig. S3). This observation further confirms the large DMI induced at the chemisorbed oxygen/cobalt interface (38). Consequently, for sub-monolayer variations of the Pd layer thickness, we can approximate that the DMI varies linearly with Pd thickness. Under this approximation, the DMI change induced by a Pd layer thickness variation of \u2206d Pd = 0.37 ML is about 37% of the DMI change induced by a Pd layer thickness variation of \u2206d Pd = 1 ML, which, as described above, amounts to 0.41 \u00b1 0.17 meV/ atom. As our experiments show that the DMI variation induced by \u2206d Pd = 0.37 ML equals that induced by adding 0.24 ML oxygen onto the Ni surface, which is (0.41 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 0.37 = 0.15 \u00b1 0.06 meV/ atom, these measurements allow an estimate of the DMI induced by the chemisorbed oxygen as ( 0.41 \u00b1 0.17 ) \u00d7 0.37 _ 0.24 = 0.63 \u00b1 0.26 meV / atom for 1 ML of oxygen coverage."

Here, we compare only measurements derived using the experimental approach described in (10,19,23) to avoid potential systematic biases due to the use of different methods. Compared to another light element, the DMI at the oxygen/Ni interface is approximately four times larger than that at the graphene/Co interface, where D graphene/Co = 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 meV/atom (23).

In the following, we demonstrate experimentally that chemisorbed oxygen can be used to tailor the spin texture of magnetic bubbles. Compound SPLEEM images in Fig. 4 (A to F) highlight DW structures in a down-magnetized magnetic bubble with uniaxial anisotropy at various oxygen coverages in a Ni(1 ML)/Co(3 ML)/Pd(2.6 ML)/W(110) sample, where a complete chirality transition from left-handed (Fig. 4A) to achiral (Fig. 4D) to right-handed (Fig. 4F) is observed. Note that the deformation of the bubble shape is due to the oxygen-induced change of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. To demonstrate the role of oxygen-induced DMI on regular skyrmions, we also performed experiments on oxygen-assisted skyrmion evolution in the isotropic [Co/Ni] 3 /Cu(111) system, without any uniaxial anisotropy. The skyrmion shown in Fig. 4G is a left-handed hedgehog type. With increasing oxygen coverage (0.12 and 0.21 ML oxygen in Fig. 4, H andI, respectively), the skyrmion gradually evolves to the Bloch type. Note that the Bloch-type chirality is not defined by the interfacial DMI; therefore, a bubble with bigger diameter may exhibit achiral Bloch walls at the same oxygen coverage (fig. S3C). These results represent a new approach to tailor the inner structure of magnetic bubbles or skyrmions, which may influence the stability and dynamic properties of the initial bubble domain, due to possible changes of topological number or DW-typedependent current-induced dynamics (10)."

The large magnitude of the DMI induced by oxygen may be sufficient to stabilize magnetic chirality in a-few-nanometer-thick magnetic films; for instance, the chirality in typical perpendicular magnetic anisotropy multilayers [Co(1 ML)/Ni(2 ML)] n might be stabilized up to n = 5 (roughly 3 nm thick). The physical origin of the large magnitude of the oxygeninduced DMI is linked to the electric surface dipole moment induced by charge transfer and related hybridization between p-orbitals of oxygen and d-orbitals of ferromagnets (31). The charge transfer can be explained by the large difference in electronegativity, and therefore, our results provide experimental evidence for the recently predicted relationship between DMI and electronegativity (32). A large work function change (~0.7 eV) is observed for the Ni/Co/ Pd/W system upon oxygen chemisorption (fig. S5A), which confirms the oxygen adatom-induced dipole moment (36). This suggests that other adsorbates with strong electronegativity differences may also induce a sizable DMI."

                                "All calculations were based on DFT. Because of the preferred hexagonal growth of Ni, Co, and Pd, we approximated the whole system to follow this pseudomorphic growth. The lattice constant was chosen to be 250 pm. For the stacking order, we followed the preferred bulk ordering for each metal. This results in a reduced C 2v symmetry, in agreement with the real physical system. To most accurately model the W(110), we adjusted the W interlayer distances to obtain the correct experimental bulk volume. Structural relaxations have been performed to determine the remaining interlayer distances using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (44,45) using the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (46) for exchange and correlation effects and the projectoraugmented wave method (47). The magnetic properties were determined in the local density approximation (48), using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method as implemented in the FLEUR code (for the program description, see http://flapw.de). The charge densities of spin spiral states have been converged using a cutoff parameter for the basis functions of k max = 4.0 a.u. -1 and (32 \u00d7 32) k-points in the full two-dimensional Brillouin zone (2DBZ). The DMI was calculated by including spin-orbit coupling in first-order perturbation theory (49) with (64 \u00d7 64) k-points in the full 2DBZ on top of a scalar-relativistic spin-spiral calculation, as described in (50,51)."
