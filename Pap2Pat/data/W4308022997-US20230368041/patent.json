    "title": "EVENT TABLES FOR EFFICIENT EXPERIENCE REPLAY",
    "date": "2023-04-06 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Experience replay (ER) is an important component of many deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. However, uniform sampling from an ER buffer can lead to slow convergence and unstable asymptotic behaviors. Stratified Sampling from Event Tables (SSET), which partitions an ER buffer into Event Tables, each capturing important subsequences of optimal behavior. A theoretical advantage is proven over the traditional monolithic buffer approach and the combination of SSET with an existing prioritized sampling strategy can further improve learning speed and stability. Empirical results in challenging MiniGrid domains, benchmark RL environments, and a high-fidelity car racing simulator demonstrate the advantages and versatility of SSET over existing ER buffer sampling approaches.",

                                "Many recent deep reinforcement learning (RL) breakthroughs rely on Experience Replay (ER) and the corresponding buffer (an ERB) to store massive amounts of data that is re-sampled during training. Consider, however, a high-frequency car-racing simulator where an agent takes thousands of steps to complete a lap and where crucial events, such as passing another car, may occur on just a few of those steps. Uniform random sampling from an ERB populated with all the lap data is highly unlikely to focus on this key event. Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), which skews sampling based on temporal difference (TD) errors, might do better, but may also focus on states unlikely to be reached by the optimal policy.",
                                "Many approaches have been proposed for prioritized ERB sampling. The most widely used is Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), which prioritizes state/actions with the largest TD errors. However, PER does not specifically focus on states aligned with the optimal policy: indeed experiences that have zero TD error under one policy may never be sampled again even after the behavior policy has changed.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "To address these limitations of existing ER methods, aspects of the present invention provide event tables, ERB partitions that hold sub-trajectories leading to events, and a corresponding wrapper algorithm, Stratified Sampling from Event Tables (SSET), to build training samples for off-policy RL.",
                        "In large domains, simply over-sampling the small number of disconnected state/actions where events occur is unlikely to be beneficial since initial state values would still rely on uniform sampling of the states between event occurrences. Instead, embodiments of the present invention store the finite-length history that preceded the event in the corresponding event table. Intuitively, this data forms a \u201cfast lane\u201d for backups between event occurrences that chains back to the initial state(s). By sampling individual steps from each table, SSET avoids the instability of using temporally correlated data in mini-batches.",
                        "Aspects of the present invention provide a theoretical underpinning for the fast-lane intuition and show that, if the events are correlated with optimal behavior and histories are sufficiently long, SSET can dramatically speed up the convergence of off-policy learning compared to using uniform sampling or even PER. Even if those conditions fail, a bias correction term preserves the Bellman target, although convergence may be slowed. From empirical results, these properties translate to different off-policy RL base learners including double deep Q-network (DDQN), soft actor critic (SAC), and the distributional quantile regression-SAC (QR-SAC) algorithm.",
                        "While SSET is a new way to optimize sampling from an ERB, it is complementary to many existing prioritization approaches or behavior shaping techniques. Specifically, SSET can be applied based on known events with TD-error PER used within each table, thereby focusing on crucial states that also need value updates.",
                        "Aspects of the present invention can apply this \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d approach in many experiments and show that it performs better than using only one of the techniques. Similarly, SSET outperforms potential-based reward shaping in empirical experiments, but the combination of two approaches provides both better agent exploration and more efficient backups. Finally, viewing each event table as a data set for a particular skill, SSET can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in RL. Experiments, described in greater detail below, show this advantage in acquiring multiple skills and retaining skills over time.",
                        "Aspects of the present invention make several contributions for ER using Event Tables, including (1) Event Tables and the SSET framework is introduces; (2) theoretical guarantees are derived that quantify the sample complexity improvement with properly designed events and provide a bias correction that ensures the Bellman target is preserved; (3) the advantages of SSET over uniform sampling or PER in challenging MiniGrid environments and continuous RL benchmarks is empirically demonstrated, and it was found that combining SSET with TD-error PER or potential-based reward shaping can further improve learning speed; (4) results are provided in the highly-realistic Gran Turismo Sport\u00ae race-car simulator where SSET improves learning speed and policy stability.",
                        "The importance of sampling along \u201cgood\u201d trajectories was explored in classical RL through RTDP and in deep RL. The latter can cause unwanted data correlation in mini-batches. By contrast, SSET does not attempt to use data from the same trajectory in a mini-batch, instead relying on sampling to spread trajectories across many mini-batches, providing both stability and backups along a trajectory. Variants of Topological Experience Replay also attempted to prioritize backups along a trajectory using a graph embedding originating from goal states. By contrast, SSET does not require goal states or a discrete state embedding.",
                        "Event Tables generalize the ideas explored in several \u201cmulti-table\u201d partitioning schemes for ERB s. For example, different tables are used to store high (or high and low) reward transitions separately from common transitions and stratified sampling is used to construct mini-batches. By contrast, SSET allows for any state-based event to partition the ERB, and more importantly, stores trajectories that led to events, not just the events themselves, which is beneficial to ensure the sample complexity guarantees.",
                        "SSET can use prior knowledge to ensure a focus on key areas of the state space and therefore has connections to initial state selection and potential-based reward shaping. As described below, SSET can outperform reward shaping on comparable states, and it can be demonstrated that SSET and reward shaping can be used together to improve exploration (shaping) and focus value function backups (Event Tables).",

ER is an important component of many deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. However, uniform sampling from an ER buffer can lead to slow convergence and unstable asymptotic behaviors. A theoretical advantage is proven over the traditional monolithic buffer approach and the combination of SSET with an existing prioritized sampling strategy can further improve learning speed and stability.

                                "Following standard definitions, a reinforcement learning agent is considered acting in an episodic Markov Decision Process M=S, A, R, P, \u03b3, I, \u03b2 with state space S, action space A, reward function R:S, A\u2192Pr[], transition kernel P:S, A\u2192Pr[S], discount factor \u03b3\u2208[0, 1), initial state distribution I:Pr[S], and episode termination function \u03b2:S\u2192{0, 1}. At time step t, the agent uses its current behavior policy \u03c0t:S Pr[A] to select an action and then observes the reward rt\u2260R(st, at) and next state s\u2032 \u02dcP(st, at). If \u03b2(s\u2032)=1 or a horizon of T is reached, then the episode ends. The value function of a policy is defined by its long-term discounted return: Q\u03c0(s, a)=R(s, a)+\u03b3Es\u2032\u02dcP(s,a)[V\u03c0(s\u2032)], where V\u03c0(s)=Q\u03c0(s, \u03c0(s)). The agent is tasked with finding an optimal policy \u03c0* and the corresponding Q*(s, a) that maximizes the expected discounted return. Aspects of the present invention focus on model-free off-policy methods that learn Q*(s, a) directly from data through incremental updates, such as Q-learning's gradient-style update to the current value function Qk(s, a): Qk+1(s, a)=(1\u2212\u03b1)Qk(s, a)+\u03b1\u03b4 with learning rate \u03b1\u2208(0, 1] and temporal difference (TD)\u2212error \u03b4=r(s, a)+\u03b3Vk(s\u2032)\u2212Qk(s, a) for Vk(s\u2032)=maxa\u2032Qk(s\u2032, a\u2032).",

To update the value networks, model-free deep RL algorithms like DDQN make updates to Q(s, a|\u03b8k) along the gradient of the TD-error. To improve stability, deep RL methods typically utilize a fixed target network for computing Vk(s\u2032) that is only updated after a batch of updates.",

It can be said that an event occurs in state s if \u03c9(s) is true. Aspects of the present invention can assume event conditions are specified by domain experts or RL practitioners; where aspects of the present invention can provide guidance on selecting a default set of useful event conditions, as discussed in greater detail below. It can be proven that event conditions that are true only in states that are visited more often by the optimal policy than the behavior collection policy yield sample efficiency gains when paired with sufficiently long histories. Terminal goal states, high reward states, bottleneck states, or important rare states (e.g., passing another car) are all strong candidates. To avoid under-sampling any crucial states, histories \u03c4 can be long enough (in expectation) to reach back to a previous event occurrence, an initial state, or the horizon and chain together from I to the optimal policy's final state(s). Finally, outside of the core theory, when using function approximation, negatively rewarding states that are not often encountered by the optimal policy may be useful event conditions to avoid catastrophic forgetting of these possible outcomes from nearby states.",

Given n event specs {vi|i\u2208[1, n]}, the ERB is partitioned into n event tables, Bvi and a \u201cdefault\u201d table B0. Each Bvi holds only time steps where \u03c9i(s\u2032) was true or steps preceding the event occurrence in the \u03c4i-length history. The default table B0 holds all time steps, including those with event occurrences. Data is inserted into each table in a FIFO manner with table capacities governed by parameter and later used to construct training data for an off-policy RL algorithm A.",

If \u03c9i(st+1) is true (line 13), the experience and all the \u03c4i steps preceding the event that were not already sent to Bvi are added there as well. Intuitively, each table contains data necessary to train the value function in the area approaching an event occurrence and chain together to form a \u201cfast lane\u201d (see FIG. 1) for backups that will be over-sampled compared to monolithic ER. For simplicity Algorithm 1 assumes each event spec maps to a unique table (lines 4 and 14) but the mapping could also be surjective. Note that the (potentially overlapping) data stored in these tables can be managed efficiently by ERB implementations.",

                                "Like PER and other ERB prioritization schemes, SSET can introduce bias in stochastic environments. In the extreme case, if P(s, a) has equal probability for two terminal states s1 and s2 but only \u03c9(s1) is true, then sampling from the event table will skew the data distribution higher for s1 outcomes. To alleviate this error, line 19 of Algorithm 1 applies a weighted correction derived in Lemma 2. The full correction term applies a weight based on the probability of s, a not being in each event table, which can be computed in discrete domains by counting the number of times a (s, a) pair was not part of any event history. For continuous domains, a priority sum tree data-structure could be used, similarly to PER, by setting priorities for samples in the event buffer equal to (1+\u03b7) and samples outside to (1\u2212\u03b7). The correction weights for each transition inside the event tables would be priority-sum 1+\u03b7. However, this approach is aggressive and might slow down learning, as seen in PER. It should be noted that, for deterministic MDPs, the correction is not needed. In environments without non-goal terminal states, increasing \u03c4 may mitigate some bias by storing more non-event outcomes in the event table. According to mildly stochastic empirical studies, this longer \u03c4 approach can be used.",

Then, event conditions can be formally defined on the states with low optimal policy disparity or final states of the optimal policy. This definition can be extended to event sections and their corresponding tables that include sufficient history to (on expectation) reach back to a previous event or initial state. One can then quantify (Lemma 1) the over-sampling of experience in the event tables can be quantified (Lemma 1) and the convergence rate can be derived (Prop. 3) and the bias correction procedure (Lemma 2) can be derived. Finally, the resulting convergence bound is shown to be an improvement over uniform sampling."

A dense neural net architecture with hidden layers is used to encode the Q-functions and an E-greedy behavior policy for collecting data. In each experiment, SSET demonstrates improvements in sample complexity or decreased variance against uniform experience replay (Uniform ER), an off-policy version of an (on-policy) reverse sweep of updates from the goal (Reverse-sweep*; in the spirit of episodic backward update (EBU)), and TD-error prioritized experience replay (PER).",
                                "Proof of Concept: Three Room Grid World. It is first demonstrated the sample complexity speedup of SSET in a three-room world (see, FIG. 2A). The agent's observation is its 3D grid position and orientation (x, y, \u03b8) and its available actions are turn-left, turn-right and forward. The rewards are +1 at the green square and \u22120.1 otherwise. Two event conditions are used for SSET with a history length of 200: one that occurs at any gap state between two rooms, and another that occurs at the green square. FIGS. 2B and 2C show the mean and standard error (from 30 randomly initialized runs) of the learned Q-values summed across the entire state-action space and the resulting episodic return during the course of training. SSET performs best in terms of both sample efficiency and learning stability (lower variance between runs). The result against a reverse-sweep approach demonstrates the utility of the intermediate gap events, which serve as waypoints for the backups. FIGS. 2D and 2E compare SSET to PER and a combination of the two. PER speeds up learning compared to uniform sampling, but with considerably more variance across seeds than SSET, possibly due to overestimation bias. Combining SSET with TD-error prioritization yields the best of both worlds: providing reliable local Bellman target estimates and prioritizing samples with high error to those targets.",
                                "Comparison with Shaping Rewards. Potential-based shaping (PBS) provides a framework for adding rewards to speed up learning without affecting the optimal policy. Similar to PBS, SSET preserves optimality while providing an effective way to infuse domain knowledge. Here, the performance of SSET and reward shaping are compared, as well as their combination, in a grid-world domain similar to the previous experiment (see FIG. 3A). A shaping potential with \u03d5(s)=1 at the gap and 0 elsewhere is used to provide a reward component of (\u03b3\u03d5(s\u2032)\u2212\u03d5(s)) in addition to the environmental (goal) reward. SSET uses events that occur at the gap and the goal. FIGS. 3B and 3C show SSET outperforms both shaping and the no-shaping baseline. While reward shaping acts as a heuristic to speed up exploration, those rewards still need to be bootstrapped back to the initial states, which is the forte of SSET. Thus, when the two are combined, even better performance is realized as shaping guides exploration and SSET provides a \u201cfast lane\u201d to bootstrap the values. Comparisons to less ideal potential shaping functions and ablations of the \u03b70 parameter for SSET in this domain are discussed below.",

Based on the formal definition of event conditions (Def. 4), good events occur in states that are aligned along optimal trajectories. It is assumed that such event conditions are typically specified by domain experts or RL practitioners. In this section, the performance of SSET is evaluated when the event conditions are badly designed and this is compared against good conditions, along with other baselines such as uniform ER with different potential reward-shaping functions. Finally, is was studied how performance varies with changes to the default buffer's sampling probability (go).",
                                "FIG. 4A shows results from the 2D grid world domain used in the reward shaping comparisons. The task is to get to the destination square starting from an initial bottom-left grid position, which requires navigating through the gap between the rooms. Several potential reward-shaping functions were compared to pick a good baseline. FIG. 4B shows the statistical means (computed from 30 randomly seeded runs) of episodic-return during training using different potential shaping functions: gap (+1 at the gap grid position and zero everywhere), manhattan_goal (normalized manhattan distance between agent's position and the goal), manhattan_gap (distance to the gap), right-wall (normalized x-distance to the right boundary wall), left-wall (normalized x-distance to the left boundary wall) and no-shaping. Not surprisingly, the best performing shaping function is the \u201cgap\u201d function, which motivates the agent to get to the gap first. Others perform either similar or subpar to the experiment with no-shaping rewards.",
                                "Next, SSET performance was compared for different event conditions and \u03b70 0.7: two conditions (based on Def. 4) that trigger at the goal and gap (gap_goal), or goal alone (only_goal) with a sufficient history length (\u03c4=30). Three less-ideal conditions were selected that occur at positions near the goal (near_goal), at the gap (only_gap) and near the initial position (near_initial), respectively. FIG. 4C shows statistical means of the corresponding experiments along with the baselines of shaping (using the gap potential function) and uniform ER with no shaping. The plot shows that there is a significant improvement in learning efficiency for experiments using the well-defined events. The performance of SSET of near_goal event condition is not ideal, but still much better than the best shaping baseline. Experiments with only_gap and near_initial conditions perform similar to the Uniform ER (no-shaping) as learning relies significantly on transitions in the default buffer to bootstrap the value from the rewarding states (goal reward in this case) to the states where the events occur. Based on these results, it was concluded that both reward shaping and event tables show degradation when using poorly chosen shaping functions or event conditions but that even with poorly chosen events SSET often outperforms reward shaping in this domain.",
                                "Next, it was compared how SSET's performance varies with default-buffer's sampling probability (see FIGS. 5A through 5E). The plots show that experiments with good conditions are least affected by the changes in \u03b70. The experiment with the mediocre condition (near_goal) seems to benefit from fine-tuning (best at 0.7), and the experiments with bad conditions suffer (\u03b70<0.7) due to under-sampling the default buffer. For all practical purposes, it is recommend using higher values for 110 unless the event conditions are carefully designed.",
                                "Obstacle Course and Randomized Skill Environment. The more complex obstacle course environment includes multiple sections (see FIG. 6A) containing spikes with \u22121 reward (yellow squares), lava with \u22121 reward and episode termination (orange squares), and colored keys to open doors. The exact positions of lava, gaps in the walls, keys, doors, and key/door colors are randomly set in each episode but the ordering of the rooms is fixed (e.g., the spikes are always in the first room). The agent's task is to get to the green square starting from the top-left corner. The agent's observation include (a) an egocentric 5\u00d75 localized forward-view image that encodes a representation of obstacles around it, (b) a Boolean indicator for carrying an object, (c) a 2D representation (category, color) of the object it is carrying, otherwise (\u22121,\u22121), and (d) 3D grid position and orientation (x, y, \u03b8). The agent's action space includes 3 additional actions (pickup key, drop key, toggle door). Event conditions are used with a history length of 50 associated with each obstacle category (e.g., picked-up-a-key, opened-a-door, and the like). FIGS. 6B and 6C clearly illustrates the improved efficiency and stability of using event-tables over reverse-sweep and uniform ER. In comparison to TD-error prioritization (FIGS. 6D and 6E), again PER exhibits more variance across multiple seeded runs. Interestingly, in this domain, SSET performs equally well with or without additional TD-error prioritization.",
                                "Finally, a randomized multi-skill setup was considered where the agent must either avoid lava, go through a gap, or open the correct door to reach the goal (FIGS. 7A through 7C). The scenario (lava, gap, or open-door) and object positions/colors are sampled randomly for each training episode. This is a more challenging task than the obstacle course above because object locations don't follow a fixed sequential pattern. A square that contains a door in one episode may contain lava in the next one. Using uniform ER, value function learning is dominated by the easier skills (lava, gap) and the agent fails to acquire the difficult open-door skill. Learning using SSET performs much better, acquiring and maintaining all the skills compared to uniform sampling and even PER.",
                                "Catastrophic Forgetting in Obstacle Course. Here, it is illustrate how SSET avoids catastrophic forgetting that hampers even PER during extended learning in the obstacle course experiment presented above. At the end of each episode during training, the agent is always reset to the top-left corner (1, 1) of the environment. At a frequency of every 20 epochs during training, the performance of the agent was evaluated starting from a slightly shifted initial grid position (1, 4) as shown in FIG. 8A. FIG. 8B shows the number of successful episodes over the 30 seeded runs of the experiment for each evaluation checkpoint. An episode is considered successful if the agent is able to navigate through the obstacles and reach the green square. The plot shows that the agents with both uniform and TD-error prioritized experience replay learn how to complete the task early on, but forget the skill as the training continues. It was hypothesized that due to changing epsilon-greedy behavior policy, the Q-function updating with samples from a standard FIFO uniform (and even prioritized) replay buffer, quickly begins to over-fit trajectories starting from (1, 1) avoiding the nearby negative rewarding spikes. Over-fitting on these trajectories potentially leads to losing previously learned estimates for nearby transitions. On the other hand, with SSET and sampling from the at-spike event table that is unaffected by the updating behavior policy, the agent continues to improve its value estimates for those transitions over time resulting in a better behavior.",
                                "In the context of this particular experiment and similar RL domains, having robust performance against perturbations is not typically expected and therefore catastrophic forgetting may not be a serious issue. However, it becomes a challenging issue to tackle in realistic domains like racing games, such as Gran Turismo\u00ae, where the training and testing distributions can be different or the domain is simply so large that one can forget low probability events, like leaving the course, as described below.",
                                "Intermediate Events, Histories, and Sampling Weights. The proof of Theorem 1 shows that SSET improves sample complexity along transitions from the optimal trajectory that are, with high probability, stored in the Event Tables. This probability can be increased by either increasing the number of event conditioned tables n with short histories or having fewer tables with longer histories \u03c4i. However, the proof of Lemma 1 shows the latter is not as effective, especially in early learning when the histories leading to a far-off event may contain many sub-optimal actions, diluting the impact of that table until the policy is better optimized. Instead, when possible, it is best to have many events acting as waypoints in the environment as shown in FIG. 1. An empirical test is now presented, supporting this insight in the sparse-reward obstacle course environment presented above. The test doubles as a comparison to methods that partition an ERB based solely on reward conditions without corresponding histories.",
                                "SSET is compared with the intermediate events used above (pickup-key, at-door, and the like), each with a history length of 50 against only using a terminal rewarding event with different history lengths. FIG. 9 shows the statistical average curves of episodic return during the course of training computed from 30 random seeded runs. It is clear from the result that SSET with intermediate events outperforms the rest. Intuitively, intermediate events can be seen as waypoints on the fast lane for TD backups to the initial states, thereby improving the overall sample efficiency. The plot also highlights that just sampling terminal goal states (as in speech-emotion recognition (SER), \u03c4=1 in the chart) or transition sequences leading to them (as in teach by reinforcements (TER), EBU or Reverse-Sweep*, higher \u03c4 values) may not be sufficient to achieve improved efficiency in a sparse reward setting like the Obstacle Course.",
                                "Finally, in FIG. 10, SSET performance is compared for different sampling weights \u03b7i keeping the default table's sampling weight fixed (110=0.5). Handset \u03b7i are \u03b7I>0=0.5/6=0.083 are weights distributed equally across the six event tables, \u03b7door=0.4 assigns a large weight to the door event table and \u03b7done=0.4 assigns a large weight to the done table. The sampling is done such that there is at least one sample picked from each table. The results show that the performance is similar with the extreme sets showing some minor fluctuations at the end, but still performing better compared to using uniform experience replay. A general recommendation is to start with using equal weights across all events tables and if needed tuning them further to get a peak performance.",
                                "Conflict Averse Gradient Descent with SSET. Most temporal-difference RL algorithms, like Q-learning, rely on minimizing Bellman errors to local target estimates. With an increasing number of outer iterations, these local targets inch closer to the true global target Q*, thereby optimizing the RL objective asymptotically. During early training, stratified mini-batch sampling from event tables could result in local gradients that may conflict with each other. Using a standard average gradient descent approach, like SGD, might not be beneficial for uncommon or difficult-to-learn events as the average gradient would be skewed in the direction of the easier events. For example, in the randomized multi-skill experiment presented above (see FIG. 7), the agent takes longer to learn the open-door skill compared to the others. Previous multi-task learning work has proposed several approaches mitigating this problem, albeit in a multi-task pareto-optimal setting. Aspects of the present invention explore using one such recently proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm called Conflict-Averse Gradient descent (CAGrad) to see if this could boost up learning the difficult open-door skill.",
                                "FIGS. 11A through C show statistical results using CAGrad with SSET for different values for the algorithm hyperparameter c\u2208(0, 1), which controls the extent of minimizing conflicts between losses within a local ball centered around the average gradient. Therefore, setting c=0 reduces to the standard average gradient descent. The plots illustrate that higher values of c boost initial learning but result in lowering the asymptotic value. This can be explained by the fact that, as the local value function targets Qk move closer to the global target Q*, the conflicts between event-section losses minimize making conflict optimization redundant. It can be hypothesized that scheduling the parameter c from high values to zero during the course of training would improve the sample complexity and reach optimal asymptotic behavior."

For the LunarLander environment, two event conditions were used for SSET with a history length of 200: one that occurs when both lander's legs make contact between the flags, and another when the lander's position is close to the middle of the flags. For the MuJoCo suite, three event conditions were used that occur when the agent receives rewards greater than certain thresholds. Each of those events used history lengths of 200. The thresholds were manually selected for each environment based on the reward bounds. The state-of-the-art SAC RL algorithm was used to compare SSET against uniform experience replay and PER at different priority exponents. FIGS. 12A through 12E show the statistical mean and standard errors of empirical returns computed from 30 randomly seeded episodes evaluated at different epochs during training. The results definitively illustrate SSET improves sample efficiency (by roughly half the number of epochs) and achieves stable policies by bootstraping the salient rewards more rapidly. All four of the MuJoCo domains and LunarLander show similar patterns for SSET. PER performs at-best similar to the uniform experience replay and the performance degrades as the priority exponent is increased. It is suspected that this is because of the high density of shaping rewards, which makes the TD-Errors volatile, making them a bad match for PER.",

FIGS. 13A through 13D show the average episodic return (with std-error shown using the shaded regions) during the course of training computed from 30 random seeded runs. In MuJoCo domains, rewards are proportional to the continuous progress made by the agent and with events based on reward thresholds, sample histories for a higher threshold get stored in the tables corresponding to the previous threshold. The results of this study show SSET is again robust to \u2018non-optimal\u2019 history lengths, but still show the benefits from using sufficiently long history lengths. These results reinforce the use of longer history lengths in the absence of prior knowledge, and also show the history lengths can be tuned for a peak performance."

The environment is a relatively straight 1700 meter section of the course with the RL agent always launched behind (in training between [10, 40] meters) one built-in-AI from the game. To succeed, the agent needs to use the opponent's slipstream to accelerate beyond its top open-air speed and use the added momentum to slingshot by the opponent and hold it off to the end of the section.

As learning progresses, off-course events become very scarce compared to the roughly 1200 steps an agent takes per lap.

It should be noted that this is an extension of the formal event spec definition since the event condition here is based on a history of states, not just s\u2032. The results of this approach (blue labeled lines in FIG. 17A) show the oscillating behavior is replaced by consistent on-course laps, with 88.9% of SSET policies (up from 74.7% of uniform sampling policies) incurring no penalties after epoch 1000. Notably, the worst off-course percentage for the SSET runs is still better than the best percentage with uniform sampling. The minimum (out of 3 in each eval) lap times averaged across later epochs are also within 0.15 seconds. A second set of 5 runs using a is reestablish requirement with \u03c4=5s achieved virtually the same results (86.9% of policies on course with similar lap times).

In large domains like Mujoco and GT, there are already dense reward structures built into the canonical versions of the environments, so it is difficult to add \u201cyet another reward term\u201d in a meaningful way, but it is quite easy to use SSET and gain benefits from domain knowledge. As for the ease of specifying domain knowledge for SSET, the following guidelines are provided:",
                                "(1) For users that don't know their domain well, one can use a \u201cgoal\u201d event (see mini-grid experiments, above) or in a non-goal environment, use reward-threshold events (see Mujoco experiments, above) with a fairly long history and reap benefits, even without understanding the true subgoals.",
                                "(2) Even if the events are poorly chosen, the technique usually does only as badly as uniform sampling. The cases where it would actually hinder performance are relatively pathological (i.e., using the majority of the buffer for incorrect events) and are easily avoidable in practice by setting reasonable caps on the event table sizes (say no more than 30% total as indicated in FIGS. 5A through 5E with table size experiments with bad events).",
                                "(3) Event Tables in SSET only require unsigned integer indices pointing to the data that is already stored in the main buffer. The additional memory footprint expands with the number of tables times their sizes. The publicly available Reverb package already implements this data structure efficiently.",
                                "Beyond these guidelines for using user-specified events, the topic of learning a helpful set of events online is an open, but intriguing question. The difficulty in identifying events with no background knowledge is that by Definition 4, events correspond to states that are most likely on optimal trajectories, so in the extreme case knowing the perfect set of events means knowing the optimal policy's state distribution. However, in cases where some model information is known, subgoal discovery methods could be used to propose events. One could also over-specify a large number of events and attempt to learn the weights (\u03b7 and \u03ba) online, though the current work does not guarantee the convergence of such a meta-learner."

Specifically, it can be shown that the more correlated events are with optimal behavior, the larger the expected improvement. To ground the analysis and make use of existing results, tabular Q-learning with a target function is used. One can start from known finite-time convergence results in this setting. Specifically, Theorem 1 computes the lower bound of sample complexity (N) for learning an \u03b5-optimal solution using an iterative tabular Q-learning algorithm with target networks (Algorithm 2). It can be shown that the lower bound of the sample complexity for achieving \u03b5-optimal behavior is reduced by using event tables for sampling (Theorem 1).",

The state probability distribution (density) can be defined following a given policy to a finite horizon from an initial state and that can be used to define the state density disparity to the optimal policy (Definitions 2-3). Then, event conditions can be formally defined (Definition 4) on the states with low optimal-policy disparity or final states of the optimal policy. This definition can be extended to event sections and their corresponding tables that include sufficient history to (on expectation) reach back to a previous event or initial state (Definitions 5-6). Then, the over-sampling of experience in the event tables is quantified (Lemma 1) and the convergence rate is derived (Prop. 3) and bias correction procedure (Lemma 2). Finally, it can be shown that the resulting convergence bound is an improvement over uniform sampling (Theorem 1).",
