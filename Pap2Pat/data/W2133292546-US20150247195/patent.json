Examples of such outburst in Holstein-Friesian cattle include bovine leucocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD)(1) and complex vertebral malformation (CVM)(2). Calf mortality resulting from such defects causes important economic losses and raises welfare concerns.",
                                "Most inherited defects are autosomal recessive, and are typically due to loss-of-function mutations (symbol \u201cd\u201d) in essential genes. Matings between animals that are healthy but carry one copy of the mutation (genotype \u201c+/d\u201d, i.e. \u201ccarriers\u201d) will yield 25% of homozygous mutant animals (genotype \u201cd/d\u201d) that will be affected. A diagnostic test that allows the identification of +/d carrier animals, can be used either to cull carrier animals thereby eliminating the mutation and hence the defect from the population, or to avoid \u201cat risk\u201d matings between carrier sires and dams. The recent development of highly effective genomic tools, now allows for the rapid identification of the causative \u201cd\u201d mutations at the molecular level (3). Once identified, effective diagnostic tests can be developed using a range of generic DNA-based technologies that are well known by the people skilled in the art."

Affected animals are characterized by severely reduced body weight, growth retardation, severe vertebral malformations associated with a significant shortening of the spine (brachyspina) and long and slender limbs. In addition, affected animals exhibit inferior brachygnatism as well as malformation of the inner organs, in particular the heart, kidneys and testis. All reported cases traced back on both sire and dam side to a common ancestor, suggesting autosomal recessive transmission.",

Based on these findings, we developed an \u201cindirect\u201d diagnostic test on the basis of a panel of SNP markers spanning the brachyspina locus. Such an indirect test, often referred to as haplotype-based test, can and has already been used to detect +/d carrier animals. However, because the association between the disease causing \u201cd\u201d allele and the SNP alleles is not perfect, such indirect test suffer from a lack of senstivity and specificity. Some homozygous +/+ animals may erroneously be called carriers, while some +/d carrier animals may be missed. Improved diagnostic tests, ideally based on the detection of the causative mutation hence having near-perfect sensibility and specificity, are thus needed."

As the previously reported cases (f.i. 4), the six affected animals traced back, on sire and dam side, to Sweet Haven Tradition, a once popular artificial insemination (AI) Holstein-Friesian bull. Genomic DNA was extracted using standard procedures and genotyped using a previously described bovine 50K SNP array (3). Assuming that brachyspina is indeed inherited as a autosomal recessive defect and genetically homogeneous in Holstein-Friesian (as suggested from pedigree analysis), the six cases are predicted to be homozygous for a common haplotype encompassing the causative mutation. We performed autozygosity mapping using the ASSIST program (3) and 15 healthy Holstein-Friesian bulls as controls, and identified a single genome-wide significant peak (p<0.001) on chromosome 21 (BTA21). The shared haplotype spans 2.46 Mb (bTau4.0: 20,132,767-22,588,403) encompassing 56 annotated genes (FIG. 1)."

                                "Several of the 56 genes in the interval are known to cause embryonic lethality when knocked out in the mouse. We amplified the corresponding open reading frames (ORF) from genomic DNA of cases and controls but did not find any obvious disruptive DNA sequence variant (DSV). We then performed targeted sequencing of the entire 2.46 Mb interval. A custom sequence capture array (Roche Nimblegen) was designed based on the bovine bTau4.0 build, and used to enrich the corresponding sequences from total genomic DNA of two affected individuals prior to paired-end sequencing (2\u00d736 bp) on an Illumina GAIIx instrument. Resulting sequence traces were mapped to the bTau4.0 build using Mosaik (http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab). In the targeted region, the coverage of non-repetitive bases averaged 90.45 (range: 0-336) for the first sample, and 61.28 (range: 0-189) for the second, to be compared with 0.01 (range: 0-24) for the first and 0.01 (range: 0-104) for the second sample outside the targeted region. The proportion of targeted non-repetitive bases with coverage <10 was 0.12 for both samples. We used the GigaBayes software (Gabor T. Marth, Boston College, http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab) to identify DSV and detected 2,368 SNPs and 572 indels for a total of 2,940 DSVs. One thousand thirty two of these corresponded to DSV previously reported in breeds other than Holstein-Friesian, and were therefore eliminated as candidate causative mutations. Of the remaining 1,908 DSV only one was coding, causing a serine to glycine substitution in the L00516866 gene encoding a myosin light chain kinase-like protein. This DSV was not considered to be a credible candidate mutation underlying brachyspina.",
                                "We then generated mate-pair libraries from self-ligated 4.8 Kb (\u00b10.35 Kb) fragments of one brachyspina case and three unrelated, healthy controls and generated <3.7 Gb of sequence on a Illumina GAIIx instrument for each animal. Resulting traces were mapped to the bTau4.0 build using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)(10), and alignments visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)(11). Analysis of the reads mapping to the 2.46 Mb interval readily revealed a 3.3 Kb deletion removing exons 25-27 of the 37 composing the FANCI (Fanconi anemia complentation-group I) gene. The deletion was apparent from a cluster of 27 mate-pairs mapping \u02dc8 Kb apart on the bTau4.0 build, and from the complete absence of reads mapping to the deleted segment for the brachyspina case, contrary to the three controls showing normal, uniform coverage in the region. Retrospective analysis of the sequence traces captured from affected individuals confirmed the abrupt coverage drop at the exact same location. We designed a primer pair spanning the presumed deletion, allowing productive amplification of a 409 by product from genomic DNA of affected and carrier animals but not of unrelated healthy controls from the same or other breeds. Sequencing this amplicon defined the deletion breakpoints, confirming the 3,329 bp deletion (FIG. 2A). Retrospective analysis of the sequence traces captured from affected individuals identified several reads bridging and confirming the breakpoint. Conversely, primer pairs designed within the deletion did not yield any amplification from DNA of affected individuals compared to healthy ones.",
                                "Assuming that the deletion of exons 25 to 27 results in the juxtaposition of exons 24 and 28 in the mRNA, the 3.3 Kb deletion is predicted to cause a frameshift at amino-acid position 877 substituting the 451 carboxyterminal amino-acids with a 26-residue long illegitimate peptide. Moreover, the ensuing stop codon in exon 28 is expected to cause nonsense mediated RNA decay (FIG. 2B).",
                                "With its homologue FANCD2, the FANCI protein forms the ID complex that localizes to damage-induced chromatin foci. FANCI is essential for DNA interstrand crosslink repair. Like FANCD2, FANCI is monoubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase FA core complex, and phosphorylated by the ATM/ATR kinase (f.i. 12). Missense, nonsense and splice-site variants in the FANCI gene underlie \u02dc2% of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA) in human (12,13). FA patients exhibit heterogenous symptoms, including growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities, renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal and reproductive malformations (reminiscent of bovine brachyspina), as well as bone marrow failure, early onset of cancer and mortality at a young age.",

                                "We developed a 5\u2032 exonuclease genotyping assay that simultaneously interrogates the mutant and wild-type allele. The assay uses 5\u2032-TGT TAG CCC AGC AGA GGA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 3) and 5\u2032-ATT CTG AAT CCA CTA GAT GTC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 4) as wild-type PCR primer pair combined with 5\u2032-GCA CAC ACC TAT CTT ACG GTA C-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 5) and 5\u2032-GGG AGA AGA ACT GAA CAG ATG G-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 6) as mutant PCR primer pair, and 5\u2032HEX-AGT CCC AGT GTG GCT AAG GAG TGA-3\u2032IABkFQ (wild-type) (SEQ ID NO: 7) and 5\u2032FAM-CCA TTC CAC/ZEN/CTT TCT ATC CGT GTC CT-3\u2032IABkFQ (mutant) (SEQ ID NO: 8) as probes (Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium). Allelic discrimination reactions were carried out on an ABI7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems, Fosters City, Calif.) for 40 cycles in 2.5 \u03bcl volume with a final concentration of 250 nM for each probe, 500 nM for wild-type primers, 350 nM for mutant primers, Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix 1X (Applied Biosystems, Fosters City, Calif.) and 10 ng of genomic DNA. Typical results are illustrated in FIG. 3.",
                                "As expected, all available brachyspina cases were shown by these test to be homozygous for the deletion. The deletion proved to be absent in a sample of 131 sires healthy animals representing ten breeds other than Holstein. We then genotyped a random sample of 3,038 healthy Holstein-Friesian animals Carriers of the deletions accounted for 7.4% of the sample, while no animals were found to be homozygous. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the absence of homozygous animals in a sample of 3,038 individuals has probability <5%. This strongly suggests that homozygosity for the mutation is not compatible with normal health, i.e. that the 3.3 Kb FANCI deletion is causal."
