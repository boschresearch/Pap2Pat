    "title": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell engineering establishes a humanized mouse platform for pediatric low-grade glioma modeling",

    "abstract": "A major obstacle to identifying improved treatments for pediatric low-grade brain tumors (gliomas) is the inability to reproducibly generate human xenografts. To surmount this barrier, we leveraged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) engineering to generate low-grade gliomas (LGGs) harboring the two most common pediatric pilocytic astrocytoma-associated molecular alterations, NF1 loss and KIAA1549:BRAF fusion. Herein, we identified that hiPSC-derived neuroglial progenitor populations (neural progenitors, glial restricted progenitors and oligodendrocyte progenitors), but not terminally differentiated astrocytes, give rise to tumors retaining LGG histologic features for at least 6 months in vivo. Additionally, we demonstrated that hiPSC-LGG xenograft formation requires the absence of CD4 T cell-mediated induction of astrocytic Cxcl10 expression. Genetic Cxcl10 ablation is both necessary and sufficient for human LGG xenograft development, which additionally enables the successful long-term growth of patient-derived pediatric LGGs in vivo. Lastly, MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) treatment increased hiPSC-LGG cell apoptosis and reduced proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study establishes a tractable experimental humanized platform to elucidate the pathogenesis of and potential therapeutic opportunities for childhood brain tumors.",

                "Low-grade gliomas (LGGs; World Health Organization grade 1 and 2 astrocytomas) are the most frequently occurring cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) in children [41], accounting for one third of all pediatric brain tumors [44]. The most common pediatric LGG is the grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), which arises sporadically or in the context of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor predisposition syndrome. In contrast to gliomas in adults, pediatric LGGs are typically slow-growing neoplasms located in the cerebellum, brainstem, and optic pathway [61], with an overall 10-year survival rate of >\u200990% [19]. Importantly, PAs in children rarely progress to high-grade malignancy and infrequently result in death. As such, pediatric LGGs represent a chronic condition that causes significant life-long morbidity [5], including vision loss [16], neurologic deficits, and endocrine complications [18, 54].",
                "While preclinical mouse and pig models of NF1-associated optic pathway glioma (NF1-OPG [7, 29, 70]) and BRAF-driven [20] sporadic pediatric LGGs have helped elucidate the pathobiology of these tumors and served as platforms for therapeutic drug testing [22, 34], they only partially capture the essential properties of their human counterparts. Unfortunately, efforts to develop patient-derived pediatric LGG xenograft (PDX) models have been hindered by multiple factors, including their intrinsic slow growth rates [28], propensity to undergo premature senescence [30, 49], low clonogenic frequency [58], and heavy dependence on a supportive microenvironment [47]. In addition, the few existing human pediatric LGG xenograft models harbor genetic mutations (TP53/CDKN1A or CDKN2A/RB1 alterations) uncharacteristic of these childhood gliomas, especially PAs, which were specifically introduced to permit pediatric LGG cells to escape cellular senescence [55, 62]. In the current report, we leverage human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) engineering to generate humanized NF1-associated and sporadic KIAA1549:BRAF-driven pediatric LGG models, identify potential cells of origin for these tumors, and discover a CD4+ T cell-astrocyte Cxcl10 axis critical for LGG xenograft formation. Disruption of Cxcl10 expression established a new murine platform for in vivo patient-derived pediatric LGG xenograft modeling and therapeutic evaluation."

                        "To model NF1 loss of heterozygosity in pediatric LGGs arising in the NF1 brain tumor predisposition syndrome, we engineered two different hiPSCs lines, each with a distinct homozygous germline NF1 patient-derived NF1 mutation (c.2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212 and c.6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212; Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). Although the cell of origin for human pediatric LGGs is currently unknown, murine Nf1 LGGs of the optic nerve/chiasm (optic pathway gliomas; OPGs) arise from neural stem or neuroglial (progenitor) cells [36]. As such, we first differentiated NF1-null (c.2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212 and c.6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212) and control (isogenic iPSCs that have undergone identical CRISPR/Cas9 processing as the NF1-null iPSC lines, but without the introduction of a mutation) hiPSCs into multipotent human neural stem cells (iNPCs) capable of generating both neuronal and glial lineage cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S1a). Consistent with the established role of the NF1 protein, neurofibromin, as a negative RAS regulator [43], these NF1-null iNPCs had increased RAS activity (2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212, 9.2-fold; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212, 13.9-fold; 2041C\u2009>\u2009T+/\u2212, 2.2-fold\u2212; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A+/\u2212, 1.8-fold relative to CTL iNPCs; Additional file 1: Fig. S1b), but similar cAMP levels (2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212, 51% reduction; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212, 57% reduction; 2041C\u2009>\u2009T+/\u2212, 49% reduction; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A+/\u2212, 61% reduction; Additional file 1: Fig. S1c), relative to NF1-mutant iNPCs heterozygous for the same germline NF1 mutations, as we previously reported in mice [4]. In addition, to model sporadic pediatric LGGs resulting from genomic rearrangements involving the BRAF kinase gene [32, 67], we generated KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs. Both NF1-null and KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs had increased proliferation, as measured by BrdU incorporation (2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212, 7.9-fold; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212, 8.2-fold; 2041C\u2009>\u2009T+/\u2212, 3.3-fold\u2212; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A+/\u2212, 3.5-fold; KIAA1549:BRAF, 7.5-fold) and direct cell counting (2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212, 4.2-fold; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212, 4.6-fold; 2041C\u2009>\u2009T+/\u2212, 1.8-fold\u2212; 6513T\u2009>\u2009A+/\u2212, 2-fold; KIAA1549:BRAF, 3.1-fold), relative to control iNPCs (Additional file 1: Fig. S1d, e). Moreover, KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs demonstrated increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 relative to their isogenic controls, indicative of increased MAPK pathway activation (Additional file 1: Fig. S1f)."

                        "To determine whether NF1-null iNPCs generate LGGs in immunocompromised mice, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 to 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CTL or NF1-null iNPCs were implanted into the brainstems of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice at 0\u20133\u00a0days of age (PN0-3). We specifically chose the brainstem for several reasons: (1) it is the second most common brain location for pediatric LGGs arising in children with NF1 [21, 42], (2) we have previously used brainstem injections for murine Nf1-OPG stem cell tumor modeling [47], and (3) injections into the mouse optic nerve, the most common site for NF1-pediatric LGGs, create major tissue damage and induce a reactive immune microenvironment. Using established neuropathological criteria for pediatric LGGs [10], we defined a LGG as (1) a mass-occupying lesion with architectural distortion by standard H&E staining (and by MRI in a subset of cases), with (2) increased proliferation (Ki67 labeling index\u2009>\u20091%) and (3) immunopositivity for glial immunohistochemical markers used in the\u00a0routine diagnosis of human low-grade gliomas (e.g., GFAP and OLIG2). Based on these criteria and leveraging this hiPSC/murine platform, both NF1-null iNPC lines (2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212, 6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212) formed LGGs 1\u00a0month post-injection (mpi) in approximately 50% of mice injected with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 iNPCs and in >\u200985% of animals injected with 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 iNPCs (Additional file 1: Fig. S2a). Similarly, to model sporadic pediatric LGGs, we orthotopically transplanted 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs into the cerebella of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice, the most common location for sporadic PA with this molecular alteration. Over 85% of all Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice injected with KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs formed LGGs at 1mpi (Fig.\u00a01a, b). LGG sections were reviewed by an expert human neuropathologist (F.J.R.).Fig. 1Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice develop NF1-null and KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing low-grade gliomas (LGGs) a Injection of NF1-null iNPCs (2041C\u2009>\u2009T\u2212/\u2212, 6513T\u2009>\u2009A\u2212/\u2212) into the brainstems or KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs into the cerebella of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice result in the formation of LGGs detectable by MRI (denoted by red dotted lines). b Summary of injected Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice harboring iNPC LGGs. c LGGs are hypercellular (H&E staining) and immunopositive for Ku80 (human-specific antibody), Ki67, glial (GFAP, OLIG2) and neuronal (synaptophysin) marker expression, by 1\u00a0month post-injection (mpi). The tumors had both glial only (top panels) and mixed embryonal/glial (lower panels) histological characteristics. Scale bars: left, Ku80/ H&E panels, 1\u00a0mm; other panels, 100\u00a0\u00b5m. d LGGs contain CD133+, ABCG1+, PDPN+, BLBP+ and GFAP+ cells (white arrowheads).

                        "NF1-associated and KIAA1549:BRAF-driven lesions were also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (4.7-Tesla MRI, Fig.\u00a01a) and exhibited many of the histopathologic features of human pediatric LGGs. These tumors were composed of human cells (Ku80+ cells), were hypercellular, mostly parenchymal with exophytic components, either anterior or lateral to the midbrain/brainstem tissue (NF1-null iNPC tumors) or anterior to the cerebellum (KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPC tumors), and well-circumscribed (Fig.\u00a01c). The tumors contained GFAP- and OLIG2-immunopositive cells (Fig.\u00a01c), as seen in pediatric LGGs. All of the iNPC-lesions contained both glial areas, as determined by H&E, GFAP and OLIG2 (glial) immunopositivity, and embryonal-like hypercellular areas with neuronal (synaptophysin+) components, some of which contained neuroepithelial rosettes. Since the resulting tumors did not exhibit some histologic features routinely observed in pilocytic astrocytomas (eosinophilic granular bodies, Rosenthal fibers), they were classified as LGGs, which is the routine diagnostic approach in clinical practice. Moreover, the Ku80+ cells in these LGGs also expressed CD133 and ABCG1 (Fig.\u00a01d), markers of glioma stem cells [15, 59], but were immunonegative for SOX10 and p16 expression, which can be observed in some patient pediatric LGGs (Fig.\u00a01d). iNPC LGGs were negative for the OCT4 and NANOG hiPSC pluripotency markers, as well as for SMA and AFP endoderm and mesoderm markers, but were immunopositive for the Nestin neural stem cell marker (Additional file 1: Fig. S2b). Additionally, KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing LGGs demonstrated increased ERK1/2 activity relative to the surrounding non-neoplastic brain tissue (Additional file 1: Fig. S2c). Importantly, neither heterozygous NF1-mutant nor control iNPCs formed LGGs in Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Additional file 1: Fig. S2d), consistent with the requirement for NF1 loss of heterozygosity in NF1-LGG tumorigenesis.",
                        "RNA sequencing or methylation studies were not used to compare the humanized iNPC-LGGs with resected patient LGGs: iNPC-LGGs are composed entirely of human neoplastic cells and cannot be directly compared with human LGG biospecimens, in which 30\u201350% of the cells are monocytes, neurons, and T cells [13, 23, 50, 51, 57]. In addition, while methylation has proven valuable for separating classes of brain tumors, it is not as accurate in distinguishing subclasses of pediatric LGGs and glioneuronal tumors. This is due in part to the variable contributions of non-neoplastic elements, with the diagnostic standard involving histology, immunohistochemistry, and genetic analysis for the specific drivers involved (e.g., BRAF, NF1) [12, 52]. For these reasons, we employed two additional\u00a0complementary approaches to compare hiPSC-LGGs to their spontaneously arising clinical\u00a0counterparts. First, leveraging human bulk RNA sequencing data [46], we identified PDPN as a gene differentially expressed both in NF1-associated and sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas relative to control non-neoplastic brain tissue (Additional file 1: Fig. S2e). Second, we found that FABP7, which we previously showed to be overexpressed in mouse optic gliomas relative to control optic nerve by bulk RNA sequencing [15], was increased both in NF1-associated and sporadic pediatric LGGs relative to control non-neoplastic human brain (Additional file 1: Fig. S2e). Similar to their spontaneously arising pediatric LGG counterparts, both PDPN and BLBP (FABP7 protein) were expressed in the humanized NF1-null and KIAA1549:BRAF-associated LGGs in situ (Fig.\u00a01d).",
                        "As expected for pediatric low-grade tumors, and mirroring clinical observations, mice with hiPSC-derived LGGs did not exhibit increased mortality nor obvious abnormal\u00a0neurologic findings. To determine whether these lesions reflected the chronic non-malignant nature of pediatric LGGs, we assessed tumors at 1, 3 and 6\u00a0mpi (Fig.\u00a02). Using power calculations with a two-sided, two portions test, where power was set at 80% and significance at 0.05, we estimated that a minimum of 4, 4, and 5 mice would be required to detect tumor formation at 1\u00a0mpi, 3\u00a0mpi and 6\u00a0mpi, respectively. With appropriately powered cohorts, mice injected with NF1-null and KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing iNPCs formed LGGs that were histologically similar at 1, 3 and 6\u00a0mpi (Fig.\u00a02a). While these lesions grew in size over time, occupying on average 10\u201336% of the brainstem or 10\u201315% of the cerebellum, respectively (Fig.\u00a02b), they had similar proliferative indices (Ki67+ cells) at 1, 3 and 6\u00a0mpi (Fig.\u00a02c). The glioma tumor areas exhibited low proliferative indices (4\u20136% Ki67+ cells), within the upper range of proliferation rates seen in pediatric PAs [64], whereas the embryonal-like areas exhibited slightly higher proliferative rates (8\u201315% Ki67+ cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, c). There was no evidence of increased apoptosis (0.38\u20130.41% TUNEL+ cells; Fig.\u00a02d) or increased cellular senescence (0.3\u20130.4% \u03b2-galactosidase+ cells; Additional file 1: Fig. S2f) in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that iNPCs generate both NF1-associated and sporadic LGGs in vivo.Fig. 2Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice develop persistent LGGs a Percentage of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice harboring LGGs at 1, 3 and 6\u00a0mpi.

To identify mouse strains that permit LGG formation, NF1-null iNPCs were injected into the brainstems of a series of immunodefective mouse strains (listed in Fig.\u00a04a). Whereas LGGs readily formed in NOD/SCID, CD4-deficient and CD4/CD8-deficient mice at 1mpi, no tumors developed in CD8-deficient mice or strains deficient in the expression of microglia or T cell chemokine receptors (Cx3cr1, Ccr2) [45], components required for murine Nf1 optic glioma formation and growth (Additional file 1: Fig. S5a). To identify potential responsible molecular etiologies underlying CD4+ T cell deficiency-mediated LGG formation, we performed transcriptomal analysis on whole brainstems of wild type and Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.\u00a04b, c; Additional file 1: Fig. S5b). We initially identified eight downregulated transcripts and one upregulated transcript in Rag1\u2212/\u2212 relative to wild type mouse brainstems (Fig.\u00a04d). While three downregulated transcripts were validated in independently-acquired Rag1\u2212/\u2212 brainstem samples (Chil3, Cd59, Cxcl10; Fig.\u00a04e; Additional file 1: Fig. S5c), only Cxcl10 expression was decreased in all immunodefective mouse strains that permitted LGG formation.Fig. 4CD4+ T cells control iNPC LGG formation in a Cxcl10-dependent manner a  Mouse strains harboring NF1-null iNPC-derived LGGs at 1\u00a0mpi. b Schematic detailing the experimental design. c Heat map analysis of RNA sequencing performed on whole brainstem tissues from na\u00efve wild type (WT) and Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice reveals segregation of transcript expression. d List of >\u20093-fold differentially expressed transcripts from the brainstems of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to WT controls. e Relative expression (R.E.) of Cxcl10 transcripts in WT and immunodeficient (CD8-deficient, Rag1\u2212/\u2212, NOD/SCID, CD4/8-deficient and CD4-deficient) mice. n\u2009=\u20095; data are represented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test correction.

                        "Since Cxcl10, a cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family, is predominantly expressed by microglia and astrocytes [68], we next analyzed these cell types in uninjected wild type and immunodeficient mouse brainstems. Whereas microglia density and morphology was relatively unaltered in all uninjected mouse brains analyzed (Additional file 1: Fig. S6a), there were fewer GFAP+, EAAT2+ and ALDH1L1+ astrocytes in the brainstems of all immunodefective mouse strains that permitted LGG formation (Additional file 1: Fig. S6b). This finding suggested that LGG formation may require a deficit in astrocytes. Consistent with an astrocyte defect, astrocytes isolated from Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced Cxcl10 expression relative to wild type controls (86.3% reduction, Fig.\u00a04f). Importantly, incubation of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes with activated wild type mouse T cell-conditioned medium (TCM) induced Cxcl10 protein production. The greatest increase in Cxcl10 protein production was observed after induction of Rag1\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes with TCM from CD4+ (24.4-fold), relative to CD8+ (6.5-fold), T cells (Fig.\u00a04g). Taken together, these results indicate that reduced astrocytic Cxcl10 expression in glioma-bearing mouse strains likely reflects an absence of CD4 T cells, which induce Cxcl10 expression in astrocytes to hinder LGG growth in vivo."

                "Building upon prior studies using hiPSC-derived 2D and 3D organoid cultures to study high-grade gliomas [1, 35, 39, 53] and medulloblastoma [63], we developed a humanized xenograft platform to model sporadic and NF1-associated pediatric LGGs and elucidate the pathogenesis, cellular origins, and signaling pathway dependencies. Beyond the value of this system to PDX pediatric LGG future preclinical experimentation, this study raises several important points germane to human brain tumor pathobiology.",
                "First, leveraging hiPSC engineering for humanized tumor modeling represents an efficient system applicable to other low-grade nervous system tumor xenografts, which have been extremely challenging to establish in mice [28, 30, 49]. Relevant to pediatric LGGs, like NF1-PA and BRAF-driven PAs, the derivative tumor cells undergo oncogene-induced senescence [49] and display a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in vitro unless provided with fibroblast conditioned medium and ROCK inhibition [65] or senolytic inhibitors [11]. The fragility of these PA tumor cell cultures likely reflects their profound stromal (tumor microenvironment) dependence, as well as their limited intrinsic self-renewal capacity [59], as demonstrated using genetically engineered mouse models and murine pediatric LGG explant systems. In these studies, Nf1 optic glioma growth in mice requires T cell and microglia support through the elaboration of critical cytokines and growth factors, as Nf1 optic glioma stem cells cannot form glioma-like lesions in mice lacking these stromal cells [22, 47]. Similarly, KIAA1549:BRAF-expressing cerebellar stem cells cannot form tumors in mice lacking the T cell and microglia Ccr2 chemokine receptor [14]. Moreover, the SASP represents a cellular state characterized by the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and immune modulators, which may counter the pro-tumoral support provided by T cells and monocytes in the tumor microenvironment.",
                "Second, the hiPSC-LGG explant system provides a tractable platform to define the putative cells of origin for histologically distinct tumors, as well as histologically similar tumors arising in different locations. This is particularly important with respect to the cellular ontogeny of brain cancers. In this regard, previous mouse modeling experiments have demonstrated that multiple cell types, including differentiated cells (astrocytes [6], neurons [17]), can give rise to high-grade gliomas. Using other murine modeling approaches, NPCs [37, 45, 60], or their derivative progenitor cells [2, 8], have been shown to be the putative cells of origin, while restricted progenitors of the NPC lineage give rise to oligodendrogliomas [48] and proneural glioblastomas [40]. Moreover, additional cellular constraints, including the specific neuroglial progenitor population [60] and the particular brain location (third ventricle versus lateral ventricle germinal zone [36]) are critical determinants that dictate glioma formation and latency. In this report, we leveraged specific human neuroglial lineage cells to determine that not all lineages faithfully recapitulate LGG histological features. Whereas astrocytes do not give rise to these tumors, iGRPs, iOPCs and iNPCs with NF1 loss or KIAA1549:BRAF expression form LGGs within a month. It is intriguing to note that iGRPs give rise to more compact tumors with stronger GFAP than OLIG2 immunoreactivity, resembling optic pathway and brainstem gliomas, while the iOPC-derived lesions have looser stroma with microcystic changes and a higher density of OLIG2+ than GFAP+ cells, similar to many cerebellar human PAs. In contrast, Olig2+, NG2neg glial progenitors form Nf1 optic gliomas with delayed latency [60], which may reflect innate differences between neuroglial cell populations in humans and rodents and/or different potential cells of origin [38, 56].",
                "Third, the finding that humanized pediatric LGGs develop in a mouse strain not lacking immune cells opens a new avenue for the in vivo study of low-grade PDXs. Whereas some orthotopically injected high-grade PDXs grow in wild type mice [25], the majority of PDX studies leverage immunocompromised (usually athymic and NOD/SCID) mice, due to their inherent inability to reject engrafted human cells. However, even in these immune-impaired animals, not all tumors are able to grow [25, 31], possibly due to the lack of a trophic environment provided by a complete immune system. Since T cells present in human PAs [13] and Nf1 murine low-grade gliomas [22] establish a supportive microenvironment for low-grade glioma growth in vivo, it is important to use host systems with immune systems with limited immunologic impairment, such as Cxcl10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Additional studies are in progress to define immune function in Cxcl10-deficient mice.",
                "The relevance of Cxcl10 production to xenograft establishment and tumorigenesis is further strengthened by prior reports demonstrating that elevated CXCL10 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is associated with acute lung transplant rejection [26] and that viral CXCL10 gene therapy improves cervical cancer xenograft responses to radiotherapy [69]. In addition, increased Cxcl10 expression is inversely correlated with tumor growth and is associated with cardiac [24] allograft rejections in the PNS, such that enhanced systemic Cxcl10 expression is a prognostic biomarker of graft-versus-host disease [33]. Moreover, reduced Cxcl10 levels in HGG spheroids caused by long-term in vitro culture correlates with higher engraftment rate in immunocompetent rats [27]. Finally, CXCL10 is induced as part of the SASP [66], which limits primary human LGG cell growth in vitro through increased senescence [11, 49]. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CXCL10-mediated hiPSC- and patient-derived xenograft growth inhibition will be critical to the development of second-generation PDX models of pediatric LGGs."

                "It should be appreciated that this xenograft model system has some inherent limitations. Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice have impaired immune systems and the resulting LGGs lack some of the non-neoplastic cell types (e.g., T cells) important for murine LGG growth [3, 22, 46, 47]. Similarly, the impact of Cxcl10 loss on immune system function is unknown. Ongoing studies are focused on co-introducing hiPSC-derived monocyte populations, as well as defining the impact of Cxcl10 loss on non-neoplastic cell function. While additional work will be required to create preclinical models that fully recapitulate all of the elements of pediatric LGGs, we have generated an experimentally tractable in vivo platform for humanized orthotopic pediatric LGG modeling. Further refinement of this model has great potential to galvanize the study of a variety of different types of brain and nerve tumors, including previously unexplored low-grade subtypes, as well as advance our understanding of the molecular and cellular origins of these common brain tumors in children."

Basecalls and demultiplexing were performed with Illumina bcl2fastq software and a custom python demultiplexing program with a maximum of one mismatch in the indexing read. The analysis was generated using Partek Flow software, version 8.0. RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the mm10\u2014RefSeq Transcripts 83 assembly with STAR version 2.5.3a. Gene counts and isoform expression were derived from the annotation model output. Sequencing performance was assessed for the total number of aligned reads, total number of uniquely aligned reads, and features detected. Normalization size factors were calculated for all gene counts by CPM to adjust for differences in library size. Gene specific analysis was then performed using the lognormal with shrinkage model (limma-trend method) to analyze for differences between Rag1\u2212/\u2212 and control C57 mice.
