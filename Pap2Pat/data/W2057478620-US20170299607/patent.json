    "abstract": "The invention relates to a method of providing a prognosis for a pregnancy comprising subjecting a sample to direct mass spectral analysis, and comparing the spectra resulting from said analysis to spectra generated from samples obtained from 5 normal pregnancies. The invention describes subjecting a sample of maternal bodily fluid and/or fluids in which an embryo is cultured, or kept in, to direct matrix assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry and detection of spectral masses between 2,000 and 100,000 m/z. The changes in spectral masses, leading to changes in the profile of the spectra, are characteristic of disorders of fetal development and 10 pregnancy.",

                        "Maternal fetal wellbeing (obstetric care) is central to many world National healthcare services. The increased medicalization of pregnancy from assisted reproduction to emergency delivery due to complications of the pregnancy, such as eclampsia or fetal abnormality/distress, means that a significant proportion of any such budget is spent on Maternity and Reproductive Health. For example in the UK 3.2% of the National Health Service Budget (\u00a33.44 billion in 2010/11) is currently spent on assisted reproduction and obstetric care.",
                        "From an emotional and financial perspective (a complicated pregnancy and delivery costs an individual household 10 to 100 times more than that of an uneventful pregnancy), testing to see if the baby is \u201cnormal\u201d, progressing and \u201cunharmed\u201d is now an expectation of a healthcare service. The rise in GDP expenditure in healthcare over the last 50 years has been due in part to increased testing including that now associate with maternity. Alongside increased accuracy of such tests, there has been exponential rise in costs which have largely been ignored. There is now a need to develop pregnancy screening tests that have high efficacy but affordability to end users be they national health services, health insurance companies or individuals."

                                "Gestational Trophoblastic Diseases (GTD) covers a wide range of pregnancy-related disorders that are in many ways cancerous in nature but can also be considered forms of pregnancy with a spectrum of additional clinical features, morphologic characteristics and sometimes pathologies. GTDs were first described around 400 BC by Hippocrates but finally linked to pregnancy in 1895. GTDs present themselves as premalignant disorders of complete and partial hydatidiform mole or malignant cases such as invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, and the rare placental-site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT). Malignant GTD can be referred to as gestational trophoblastic tumours or neoplasia (GTT or GTN). The initial manifestations of GTD include, vaginal bleeding and vomiting. However, women with gestational trophoblastic tumours present with heavier abnormal vaginal bleeding, and amenorrhea, specifically in placental-site trophoblastic tumour.",
                                "As in normal pregnancy hCG tests form a major part of the diagnosis and monitoring of GTD. For many obstetricians a positive pregnancy test in the absence of a viable pregnancy (as confirmed by ultrasound) is immediately indicative of a potential GTD. In some cases, in particular choriocarcinoma, the tumour can be highly invasive and a rapid intervention by an oncologist is essential to preserve the chances of survival for the patient.",
                                "However, the management of GTD with hCG tests and ultrasound alone is insufficient to provide the full picture of varied and complicated disorders within the spectrum of GTD. Problems have already been identified in hCG assays which do not discriminate (or discriminate to much) the forms of hCG which can be detected and that in some cases false positives and false negatives have led to misdiagnoses and needless therapies. These issues have led to a better defining of hCG assays in terms of the epitopes recognized in each assay, but it has not circumvented the root problem underlying the metabolic differences resulting in the production of hCG variants. It has been suggested that the hCG form is of more significance than the absolute amount of total hCG. This qualitative problem needs a qualitative solution."

Therefore, it is not simply an exaggerated form of the classic \u2018morning sickness\u2019 which accompanies early pregnancy. Hypovolemic and metabolic derangement, especially that of thyroid function, are potentially life threatening to both the mother and developing fetus. In contrast, the experience of mild and self-limiting nausea and vomiting (morning sickness) are common occurrences in up to 80% of all women during pregnancy.",

Mortality rates from hyperemesis were considerable and as high as 159 deaths per million births, before the introduction of intravenous rehydration therapies. In the United States, the incidence of hyperemesis is much higher than in the UK, and represents an annual hospital admission of 38,000 women.",
                                "There is no universally accepted explanation or cure for hyperemesis, with management based on symptomatic approaches, including therapies such as intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, thiamine supplementation and psychological support. Nevertheless, early detection and intervention of the disorder is believed to improve management and a biochemical marker in this regard would be useful.",
                                "Although no direct link has yet been established, it has often been suggested that hCG could be the most likely cause of hyperemesis gravidarum during pregnancy. This is especially true in cases of women at risk of gestational trophoblastic diseases where hCG levels tend to be unexpectedly high. Older studies revealed that in 36% of the hyperemesis cases examined hCG levels were above the 97.5 percentile of the normal value; however, simply having high hCG is not always consistent with hyperemesis.",
                                "Biochemical hyperthyroidism, associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, has been attributed to a mechanism involving hCG cross-reacting agonistically with the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors and is identified as a risk factor of hyperthyroidism. Since, the alpha subunits of both TSH and hCG are identical they possess some agonistic effect especially at high circulating concentrations. These thyrotrophic effects of hCG are known to manifest as severe vomiting and nausea, which is the chief symptom of hyperemesis gravidarum; so much so that historically thyroid function tests were a determinant factor in pregnancy diagnosis and patient management. Furthermore, acidic isoforms of hCG have been speculated to be a causative factor in protracted cases of severe vomiting and nausea. The underlying explanation is that that acidic forms of hCG, due to the presence of additional sialic acid rich glycosylations, promotes a longer circulating half-life of the hormone, and thus an exacerbation of the thyrotrophic effects described. Significantly recent studies indicated that the involvement of hCG in hyperemesis might be structural rather than simply quantitative and a thyrotropic form of hCG has been suggested."

Despite its worldwide usage as an obstetric marker, hCG is often regarded as little more than a signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy through the subsequent maintenance of progesterone production. The hCG molecule has several isoforms attributed to varying degrees of glycosylation and stages of metabolic degradation, some of which may now have more specific functions different to that of \u201cnormal\u201d hCG. The normal or regular or intact hCG (as it is often referred, and subsequently indicated as hCG in this example) is the predominant form of hCG produced by the trophoblast during pregnancy, and is a heterodimer consisting of a hCG\u03b1, and hCG\u03b2 subunit; it is also often erroneously referred to as beta hCG and for the purpose of this example needs clarification, the beta subunit of hCG is distinct.",

There have been numerous studies on the expression and production of hCG by developing embryos in culture, however few have linked the production of specific hCG isomers to particular function or dysfunction, and only more recently suggested that variability of hCG concentrations in vitro may act as a marker for implantation potential. Several studies have suggested that measuring hCGh on its own can provide an accurate prediction of pregnancy failures. Others reported that hCGh can be used to identify a term pregnancy against failing pregnancy on the day of implantation with high accuracy. Thus, it can be useful to identify this hCG isoform in order to differentiate a successful pregnancy from that of a potential failure. It has also been noted that a correlation exists between early embryo proteomic, secretomic, and metabolic profiling, and successful implantation rates. Therefore, hCG isoform profiling in the secretome may be the key for identification of viable embryos, particularly in a non-invasive manner. This is important, considering that despite recent studies suggesting several metabolic and biochemical markers for predicting implantation, none have yet been found of any clinical value.",

For gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD), the preferred range for analysis is 35,000 m/z to 45,000 m/z. A mass shift of the peaks seen within 35,000 m/z to 37,500 m/z in a sample from patients with normal pregnancy occurs in GTD. A shift of the peaks to the range about 37,600 m/z to 39,200 m/z can be indicative of molar pregnancy and, a shift of the peaks to the range about 37,900 m/z to 39,600 m/z can be indicative of choriocarcinoma. In particular a peak around 38,405 m/z is seen in patients with a molar pregnancy and, a peak around 38,803 m/z is seen in patients with choriocarcinoma, as compared to that seen in normal pregnancy, which is around 36,687 m/z, as shown in FIG. 2.",

A computer can also be programmed with the suitable algorithm in order to provide an indication of the likelihood of a pregnancy disorder, or successful implantation.",
                                "Direct mass spectral analysis can be carried out by mass spectrometry. Suitable mass spectrometry techniques include fast atom bombardment (FAB), chemical ionization (CI), atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI), electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), Quadrupole mass analyzers, ion traps such as quadrupole ion trap, quadrupole ion trap, orbitrap, quadrupole ion trap, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTMS), Ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) or combinations of the above. Preferably, the direct mass spectral analysis can be carried out by MALDI-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.",

Direct MALDI has been applied successfully to the identification of bacterial in microbiology laboratories to great effect. In this study we also use a direct approach to analyse the spectra of urine in early pregnancy to predict the likelihood of a spontaneous abortion. Our approach disregards the identity of the proteins and peptides and looks instead at changes in profile patterns at certain HotSpots within the spectra. This variability between spectra can be used to create cut-off values. Spectral changes which indicate a future spontaneous abortion, which may lie above or below that cut-off, can be combined to build the algorithms. Therefore, by creating a decision tree involving just a few HotSpots we were able to predict outcomes with >99% accuracy and only one false negative. Variability in averaged urine spectra changes with gestational age and different mathematical approaches can be developed to optimise detection in very early pregnancy (5-7 weeks) when compared to later in the first trimester (8-10 weeks).
