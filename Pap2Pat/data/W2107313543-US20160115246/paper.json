    "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition is a potential novel strategy for treatment of CVD. Alirocumab is a fully human PCSK9 monoclonal antibody in phase 3 clinical development. We evaluated the antiatherogenic potential of alirocumab in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. Mice received a Western-type diet and were treated with alirocumab (3 or 10 mg/kg, weekly subcutaneous dosing) alone and in combination with atorvastatin (3.6 mg/kg/d) for 18 weeks. Alirocumab alone dose-dependently decreased total cholesterol (-37%; -46%, P < 0.001) and TGs (-36%; -39%, P < 0.001) and further decreased cholesterol in combination with atorvastatin (-48%; -58%, P < 0.001). Alirocumab increased hepatic LDL receptor protein levels but did not affect hepatic cholesterol and TG content. Fecal output of bile acids and neutral sterols was not changed. Alirocumab dose-dependently decreased atherosclerotic lesion size (-71%; -88%, P < 0.001) and severity and enhanced these effects when added to atorvastatin (-89%; -98%, P < 0.001). Alirocumab reduced monocyte recruitment and improved the lesion composition by increasing the smooth muscle cell and collagen content and decreasing the macrophage and necrotic core content. Alirocumab dose-dependently decreases plasma lipids and, as a result, atherosclerosis development, and it enhances the beneficial effects of atorvastatin in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. In addition, alirocumab improves plaque morphology.",

They were then sectioned perpendicular to the axis of the aorta, starting within the heart and working in the direction of the aortic arch. Once the aortic root was identified by the appearance of aortic valve leaflets and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) instead of collagen-rich tissue, serial cross-sections (5 \u00b5m thick with intervals of 50 \u00b5m) were taken and mounted on aminopropyl-triethoxy-silane (APES)-coated slides These sections were stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron (HPS) for histological analysis. For each mouse, atherosclerosis was measured in four subsequent cross-sections. Each section consisted of three segments. The average total lesion area per cross-section was then calculated (36, 37). For determination of lesion severity, the lesions were classified into five categories according to the American Heart Association classification (38): 0) no lesion, I) early fatty streak, II) regular fatty streak, III) mild plaque, IV) moderate plaque, and V) severe plaque. The percentage of each lesion type was calculated, where type I\u2013III lesions were classified as mild lesions, and type IV\u2013V lesions were classified as severe lesions (36, 37). Total plaque load in the thoracic aorta (from the aortic origin to the diaphragm) was determined after Oil Red O staining for lipids as described previously (39).",

Representative images of atherosclerotic lesions as illustrated in Fig. 3 show that alirocumab, atorvastatin, and their combination reduced lesion progression. To confirm a reduction in atherosclerosis development, we determined lesion area per cross-section (Fig. 4A) and calculated lesion severity (Fig. 4C). For the control group, total lesion area was 278 \u00b1 89 \u00d7 103 \u00b5m2 per cross-section.

                "The PCSK9 monoclonal antibody alirocumab has been shown to strongly lower LDL-C and non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) alone and on top of statin treatment (23\u201326) and is currently in phase 3 clinical development, which includes a large CVD outcome trial in hypercholesterolemic patients with relatively recent acute coronary syndrome treated with high-dose statins (42). It should be realized that the effectiveness of alirocumab on the cardiovascular end point will only be assessed in patients who also receive statins. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of alirocumab per se on atherosclerosis development and in combination with atorvastatin. Taken together, we have shown that alirocumab dose-dependently decreases plasma cholesterol and reduces progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, alirocumab improves lesion morphology and composition and enhances the beneficial effects of atorvastatin in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. This is the first study to show that a monoclonal antibody to PCSK9 reduces atherosclerosis development.",
                "Rescue of LDLR from intracellular degradation was verified by an increase in hepatic LDLR protein levels after alirocumab treatment. Consequently, alirocumab decreased TC (\u221237% to \u221246%) and TG (\u221236% to \u221239%) by a reduction in non-HDLs. The dose-dependent reduction in TC after alirocumab treatment was enhanced in combination with atorvastatin (\u221248% to \u221258%). These results support an improvement in cholesterol management by adding alirocumab to statin treatment. The dose-dependent cholesterol-lowering effects in our study are in accordance with results from phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials (23\u201326). In phase 1 trials, alirocumab administered as a single ascending dose (50 to 250 mg) in healthy subjects, and as multiple doses (50 to 150 mg) in statin-treated FH patients, decreased LDL-C by 33% to 46% and by 39% to 61%, respectively (23). Results from the latter study indicate an additive effect of alirocumab on statin treatment because similar reductions were observed with alirocumab monotherapy and in statin-treated patients.",
                "In a phase 2 trial in patients with hypercholesterolemia, addition of 50 to 150 mg alirocumab every 2 weeks to 10 to 40 mg/d atorvastatin decreased LDL-C by 40% to 72% and TC by 23% to 45% (25). In a phase 2 trial in patients with FH, addition of 150 mg of alirocumab every 2 weeks to a stable dose of statin, with or without ezetimibe, decreased LDL-C by 68% and TC by 44% (24). A multicenter phase 2 trial confirmed these findings with a 66% to 73% reduction in LDL-C and a 41% to 47% reduction in TC when adding alirocumab to either 10 or 80 mg/d atorvastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients (26). In the present study, a similar additive cholesterol-lowering effect on top of atorvastatin treatment (\u221236% to \u221248% reductions in TC as compared with atorvastatin alone) was found. The clinical trials also provide evidence for additional modest reductions in TGs and modest increases in HDL-C. However, baseline TG levels were low in the latter studies, which may explain the larger effect on TG found in our study.",
                "A higher (V)LDL clearance increases liver cholesterol exposure and may result in changes in hepatic cholesterol content and/or fecal excretion of cholesterol or, after its conversion, bile acids. However, alirocumab did not lead to hepatic lipid accumulation, whereas atorvastatin and the combination treatments significantly reduced cholesteryl ester content without changes in hepatic TG. Intriguingly, fecal output of bile acids and neutral sterols remained unchanged by the treatments (see supplementary data). In line with our data, full absence of PCSK9 was recently reported not to be associated with hepatic lipid accumulation or fecal excretion of cholesterol (43). However, contrasting data in PCSK9 \u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated increased LDL-C excretion via the transintestinal cholesterol excretion pathway and subsequently mildly increased fecal neutral sterol loss, with unfortunately no data on fecal bile acid loss (44). As opposed to PCSK9 inhibition by alirocumab in the present study, lack of PCSK9 was reported to increase fecal bile acid output (43). These data indicate that, despite the greater influx of cholesterol from the plasma compartment into the liver, hepatic cholesterol homeostasis is maintained, although the precise mechanism remains to be established.",
                "The lipid-modifying effects of PCSK9 inhibition provide indications for an atheroprotective effect. This notion is supported by data from a study where mice expressing high levels of PCSK9 had significantly more aortic cholesterol ester accumulation and developed severe aortic lesions, compared with wild-type and PCSK9 knockout mice when fed an atherogenic diet (11). In the same study, no differences were found in LDLR-deficient mice expressing no, normal, or high PCSK9 levels, suggesting that PCSK9 modulates atherosclerosis mainly via the LDLR. However, to date, the atheroprotective effect of pharmacological PCSK9 inhibition has not been investigated. Our study demonstrates for the first time that inhibition of serum PCSK9 with the monoclonal antibody alirocumab decreases plasma lipid levels and as a result reduces atherosclerosis development, as evidenced by a reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size and severity in the aortic root area and arch. This dose-dependent inhibitory effect of alirocumab on lesion size was strongly enhanced in combination with atorvastatin, where a considerable number of animals did not develop any severe lesions. Although pleiotropic effects of statin treatment may contribute to the reduction in CVD risk (45), results from our study emphasize the importance of cholesterol lowering per se in treatment of CVD. In our study, the effects of alirocumab alone and in combination with atorvastatin on lesion area were mainly predicted by the reduction in plasma TC levels as illustrated by the strong association (R2 = 0.84) between TC levels and the lesion area.",
                "In the present study, alirocumab, atorvastatin, and their combination reduced the circulating granulocytes/neutrophils and monocytes, in particular proinflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes (see supplementary data). Ly6Chi monocytes are proposed to be precursors of proinflammatory M1 macrophages (46), and studies in mice have shown that hypercholesterolemia induces Ly6Chi monocytosis (47). In addition, alirocumab decreased endothelial expression of ICAM-1 and consequently reduced monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium. In hypercholesterolemia, modified lipoproteins induce endothelium activation, thereby mediating the arrest and transmigration of circulating monocytes into the subendothelial space where they differentiate into macrophages (46).",
                "In addition to monocyte adhesion, alirocumab reduced other markers of vascular inflammation, including T-cell abundance in the aortic root area, as well as macrophage and necrotic content and cholesterol clefts of the lesions. Cholesterol crystals have been shown to be particularly proinflammatory and to trigger local and systemic inflammatory responses (48, 49). Moreover, increased macrophage content and a large necrotic core, as well as a thin, collagen-poor fibrous cap and decreased SMCs, are important characteristics of a vulnerable lesion that is prone to rupture (45). Alirocumab alone and in combination with atorvastatin reduced vascular inflammation and strongly improved the plaque morphology.",
                "The present study is a progression/prevention study that may pose a potential limitation with respect to translation to the clinic where patients with existing lesions are often treated. Nonetheless, data from this study may suggest beneficial effects on markers of atherosclerosis by reducing TC with alirocumab also in the human situation where new lesions are formed alongside existing plaques.",
                "PCSK9 has received a considerable amount of attention in the past decade as a possible target for treatment of CVD, and several approaches to inhibit the protein are currently being investigated (4). Efficacy and safety of alirocumab will be further investigated in large phase 3 clinical outcome trials, in patients with FH and in high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia on lipid-modifying therapy within the ODYSSEY program (42). These trials will reveal whether PCSK9 inhibition with alirocumab translates into clinical benefit."
