    "title": "Leaching of Rare Earth Elements from Central Appalachian Coal Seam Underclays",
    "date": "2020-06-26",
    "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REE) are necessary for advanced technological and energy applications. To support the emerging need, it is necessary to identify new domestic sources of REE and technologies to separate and recover saleable REE product in a safe and economical manner. Underclay rock associated with Central Appalachian coal seams and prevalent in coal utilization waste products is an alternative source of REE to hard rock ores that are mainly composed of highly refractory REE-bearing minerals. This study utilizes a suite of analytical techniques and benchtop leaching tests to characterize the properties and leachability of the coal seam underclays sampled. Laboratory bench-top and flow-through reactor leaching experiments were conducted on underclay rock powders to produce a pregnant leach solution (PLS) that has relatively low concentrations of gangue elements Al, Si, Fe, and Th and is amenable to further processing steps to recover and produce purified REE product. The leaching method described here uses a chelating agent, the citrate anion, to solubilize elements that are adsorbed, or weakly bonded to the surface of clay minerals or other mineral solid phases in the rock. The citrate PLS produced from leaching specific underclay powders contains relatively higher concentrations of REE and lower concentrations of gangue elements compared to PLS produced from sequential digestion using ammonium sulfate and mineral acids. Citrate solution leaching of underclay produces a PLS with lower concentrations of gangue elements and higher concentrations of REE than achieved with hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The results provide a preliminary assessment of the types of REE-bearing minerals and potential leachability of coal seam underclays from the Central Appalachian basin.",

                "Rare earth elements (REE) are essential for the development of low-carbon, renewable energy technologies. In the United States (U.S.), a lack of domestic REE production is forcing end-users in energy, high-end technology, and manufacturing sectors to seek overseas sources. Exploration and production of new domestic sources of REE and critical minerals (CM) is essential to meet future demands. The U.S. Department of Energy report-2017 Report to Congress on Rare Earth Elements from Coal and Coal Utilization Byproducts-on rare earth elements from coal and coal byproducts outlines the strategic plan for expanding the U.S. REE reserve base [1]. The plan calls for identification of coal and coal byproducts with the highest known concentration of REE and the development of cost-effective separation technologies to recover the resource. A diversified REE product slate that includes recovery of REE from domestic coal byproducts and various types of sedimentary geologic materials can contribute to supply security and help to limit risks to market disruptions [1,2].",
                "Production of REE in the United States, primarily sourced from bastnaesite and other accessory minerals, has increased between 2018-2019 from 18,000 to 26,000 tons, but is low compared to Chinese production (132,000 tons) [2]. The United States' domestic coal and coal utilization byproducts (CUB) are nevertheless promising sources of recoverable REE [1][2][3][4][5][6]. The term CUB includes a range of materials that are produced during coal utilization [1,[3][4][5][6]. Coal mining waste rock and coal preparation plant refuse are two types of byproduct that contain underclay, a clay-rich sedimentary rock that is found adjacent to a coal seam. Underclay is commonly categorized as roof or floor rock and it is exposed and sometimes excavated during the mining of a coal seam.",
                "Clay-rich horizons in Central Appalachian (CentApp) coal seams, for example, commonly contain higher concentrations of REE than the coal or other non-clay bearing rock adjacent to the coal seam [3,4]. In the CentApp region, there are approximately 840 coal refuse piles that overlie nearly 40 square kilometers of abandoned mines and coal fields. The amount of coal refuse in Pennsylvania alone is estimated to be 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 cubic meters [7]. Waste refuse piles, which plausibly contain a high percentage of clay minerals, may be heap leached or processed with limited beneficiation techniques (e.g., crushing and grinding, calcining, roasting, and floatation), compared to mineral bound ore. REE and CM can be leached from produced and stockpiled waste materials. With the availability of potential resource material, numerous studies have investigated REE recovery from coal-related materials, including coal fly ash [8,9], coal middlings [5,10], and underclays [3,4,10]. Underclays have an increased resource potential [4] as the rock is often subjected to previous diagenetic events and natural processes that transport and concentrate REE and CM in forms that may be easier to extract, compared to minerals bound in crystalline rock. Ease of extraction makes this type of material a more promising geologic source of REE and CM.",
                "Organic acids and their degradation products provide ligands and chelating agents for heavy metals [11]. The citric acid-citrate system forms a relatively stable complex with alkaline earth metals [12] as well as heavy metals and lanthanides. The citric acid molecule is composed of one alpha position hydroxyl and carboxyl group and two beta position carboxylic acid groups, together the molecule contains at least seven potential O-donor sites that are capable of coordinating metal ions [12,13]. Carboxyl groups of citric acid have been shown to complex with both bivalent and trivalent metal ions in biological systems [13,14] and during interaction with alkaline earth metal ions [12].",
                "Effects of organic acid on the leaching process of REE from ion-adsorbed clays was investigated by Wang et al. [15]. The leaching experiments by Wang et al. [15] showed REE recovery using citric acid was highest (10.4 mmol/kg) at pH range 3.5-4.0. The experiments were conducted at varying pH with the same carboxylic group concentration of 10 -4 mol/L. Rare earth element concentrations decreased in the solutions with increasing pH (from 2-6). Increased pH should lead to greater acid dissociation because of pKa shifts increasing the number of complexation sites for REE on the organic ligands. The results confirm that organic anions, including anions of citric acid, can act as assistant leaching agents both through the complexation of REE in solution and the interaction with the clay surface to promote changes in the zeta potential of the clay. This process can lead to greater leaching of sorbed cations from the clay surface or for better dispersion of individual clay grains [15].",
                "Citric acid anion recovery of REE from coal seam underclay is a promising method that may liberate higher concentrations of ion exchangeable REE from the clay compared to traditional lixiviants such as ammonium sulfate or sodium chloride. We chose to investigate the influence of organic acids on the recovery of exchangeable, or weakly bonded, REE ions from the surfaces of clay grains, as well as liberation of the nonexchangeable (stronger bonded) REE ions. Our selective approach of using pH buffered organic acid-based solutions amended with ionic constituents (e.g., (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 or NaCl) is designed to isolate and recover the exchangeable REE fraction type through partial dissolution of the Minerals 2020, 10, 577 3 of 20 clay matrix. The approach is based on previous studies which have shown that optimum recovery of REE adsorbed on clay minerals using ionic lixiviants occurs at the 3-4 pH range [15][16][17].",
                "A mildly acidic organic acid-based ionic recovery solution with the presence of a monovalent salt likely liberates clay surface adsorbed REE and some inorganic REE mineral phases embedded in the clay matrix. The leaching solution may be pH buffered for optimum recovery from different clay mineral assemblages. Clay grains have a high surface area typically with a negative net charge. Exchangeable and nonexchangeable ions are present on the surface of clay grains. The amount of cation exchange capacity (CEC) or anion exchange capacity (AEC) is dependent on the clay mineral type or presence of organic matter. Exchangeable ions are weakly held in contact with the clay solution and are readily replaced by ions in solution. Positively charged ions, such as Al 3+ , Ca 2+ , K + , and REE 3+ , may be present on clay surfaces as exchangeable ions. Nonexchangeable ions are typically adsorbed by strong bonds or held in inaccessible places within the clay matrix (e.g., K + between layers of illite). The use of organic acids can potentially increase the recovery of REE from clay-rich rocks by: (a) Maintaining a balanced charge on clay surfaces and increasing cation exchange capacity (CEC); (b) selectively dissolving matrix rock and increasing pore space connectivity and transmissivity of fluids; and (c) solubilizing phosphate bound REE [18,19].",
                "Rozelle et al. [3] identified clay-rich ore deposits that contain up to 90% of the total REE in the rock, bound as ion-adsorbed REE, with the balance existing as colloids (e.g., Fe, Mn-oxides) and crystalline minerals (e.g., REE-phosphates). In China, about 10,000 tons of rare earth oxide (REO) concentrate are produced annually from weathered elution-deposits derived from lateritic weathering of granitic rock and in situ aqueous mining yields ~200 tons of REE annually [17]. This study characterizes and tests the leaching behavior of underclay rock from geologic formations associated with coal production in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio."

The core samples were taken from strata associated with production coal seams-Lower Freeport, Middle Kittanning, and Pittsburgh No.5-in West Virginia.       A sample of approximately 200 g was either cut from the core or collected as chips and pieces. Each sample was pulverized first using a small jaw crusher then Zr-Ti lined shatter box to reduce the grain size to 149 \u00b5m or less. A mortar and pestle was used to hand-grind the material until it all passed through a 100 mesh (<149 \u00b5m) sieve. After grinding and sieving the powdered sample was homogenized using the cone and quarter technique [20]. The homogenized sample was split into specific subsamples for X-ray diffraction (30 g), elemental analysis (3 g), sequential digest (5 g), and leaching tests (0.5 g and ~40 g). Sample preparation for X-ray diffraction analysis included an additional step. The homogenized sample was ground for 60 s in a micronizing mill to achieve a grain size of <65 \u00b5m. The subsamples for the different analyses and tests were stored in chemical-free paper envelopes in a nitrogen purged desiccator until needed. The goal for sampling and sample preparation was to create a bulk homogenized underclay powder that could be used to test the recovery of REE from clay-rich material using different leaching solutions composed of organic acid anions. Bulk analysis and characterization of each sample was conducted to determine basic mineralogical and physical properties of the material. Rock chips or slices of core (3 cm \u00d7 2 cm) were used for electron microscopy imaging and X-ray microanalysis. Contextual information about the samples and core descriptions of the material are shown in Table 1. "

                        "The concentration of elements in the underclay samples, expressed as oxides, are shown in Table 4. Silicon (as SiO 2 ) and Al (as Al 2 O 3 ) are the dominant cations in all samples. The range of Al 2 O 3 concentrations (see Table 4) indicate the material comes from highly weathered crustal materials [26]. Additionally, low Ca, Na, and K values are also indicative of highly weathered horizons or zones of intense leaching. The exception is the Ca concentration in UC-06, withcalcite and siderite cement present throughout the rock matrix and visible in hand specimens (See Figure 1). The extensive network of carbonate cement throughout the clay matrix is due to late diagenesis. The presence of diagenetic calcite in sample UC-06 results in a high concentration of Ca (5.4%) compared to the other underclay samples analyzed <1.0%. Rare earth element concentrations in each sample are shown in Table 5. The four samples have REE concentrations ranging from 262-353 mg/kg (See Table 5). The results reported in Table 5 are from the powdered and homogenized samples used for characterization, sequential digest, and 1% solids leaching tests. The results from a subsequent analysis of powder samples used in the leaching tests under different pH conditions are shown in Table S1 of the Supplementary Materials. Sample UC-02, a flint clay/underclay from the Middle Kittanning formation, had the highest REE concentration. Scanning electron microscope images of polished samples (see Figure 2) and various powdered samples (data not shown) were used to evaluate the composition and texture of the rock samples. SEM images and EDS results were used to make putative identifications of primary and secondary minerals in the samples, including the REE-bearing phases present. Rare earth element phosphate minerals were observed in all samples using SEM backscatter mode. The predominant REE-bearing mineral phases observed were rhabdophane, apatite, churchite, monazite, xenotime, and crandallite sp. Examples of REE-bearing minerals observed in the underclay samples analyzed are shown in Figure 2. Yang et al. [27] provides a comprehensive characterization of all REE-bearing minerals in the samples discussed here, as well as other underclay samples from West Virginia coal seam strata.  In sample UC-04 trace concentrations (1-4 wt. %) of Ce, La, and Nd were detected in graincoating clay associated with pore filling framboidal pyrite and pyrite cement.

Illite and smectite are the most abundant clay minerals in the samples. Halloysite is present in minor (5-7%) abundance in all samples except UC-03. Clay minerals make up more than 55% of the bulk material in each sample. Semi-quantitative results for all non-clay and clay minerals identified are shown in the Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials. The samples are all composed of two-component mixed clays from the groups Kaolin (kaolinite and Halloysite) and Mica (illite). Kaolinite and halloysite were identified by evaluating changes to the 7 \u00c5 XRD peak present in the scans. In all samples the peak remained unchanged or there was a small increase in d-spacing following glycol treatment, both of which are attributed to the presence of kaolinite or halloysite. The distinguishing treatment was the destruction of the 7 \u00c5 XRD peak after heating to 550 \u2022 C. Further confirmation of the presence and classification of kaolinite and halloysite were made using electron micrographs. Kaolinite displays a hexagonal morphology whereas halloysite has a tubular morphology. Analysis of SEM images confirms the presence of grains with hexagonal and tubular morphology. Illite was confirmed through the presence of a 10 \u00c5 XRD peak that remains unchanged by glycol and heat treatments."

                        "The results of the sequential extraction of underclay powders and other leaching tests conducted on the samples in this study show that REEs are distributed across different mineral phases in the underclay. The results provided a basic screening of the distribution of REE in the bulk samples, specifically we were interested in the fraction of REE that was in the exchangeable phase. Other authors have presented results on ion-exchangeable clay from CentApp coal seam strata [2,18] and the results are not consistent across units in the basin [2,18,25]. Heterogeneity likely exists between individual clay units at the formation scale and plausibly within core samples collected from specific units. The samples may not be representative of an entire formation or basin, however, the results presented here are meaningful to evaluating different leaching solutions to recover REE from the material. The results of basic characterization efforts and leaching tests provide valuable information on not only the mineralogy and nature of REE-bearing minerals in the clay, but how the material responds to leaching with citrate solutions. In order to mature this technology and raise to a higher readiness level (TRL), currently at TRL 4-5, both the type and scale of sampling must be reconsidered, and the amount of material tested (e.g., scale) will have to be increased several fold. This is necessary due to the prevalence of heterogeneity and spatial variability of elements in geologic materials, as well as the presence of hot spots in such materials and within specific areas [28].",
                        "The samples discussed here and in Yang et al. [27] were taken from existing core samples. The characterization and analysis results reported here are from subsamples taken from the bulk, homogenized material prepared for the leaching tests. The results of basic sequential digest of the material, which can be considered a step-wise leaching test, are compared to the results of leaching using citrate. The results of the leaching tests are significant to evaluating alternative lixiviants (e.g., citric acid-citrate) and to compare the results to standard conventional mineral acid or salt leaches. The characteristics of the new solution, at minimum, should leach the ion-exchangeable fraction of REE from the samples, not produce excess liquid or solid hazardous waste, and be amenable to downstream processing to separate and recover REE in its pure form. Our leaching tests and demonstration of sorbent capture of REE from the citrate leachate demonstrate the potential of this technology.",
                        "We trialed a suite of different organic acids (e.g., acetic, indole-3-acetic, citrate) and formulations during our initial testing and development of an organic acid based lixiviant for recovering REE from clay [29]. Based on initial results we chose to pursue further testing and optimization of a citrate-based solution. A majority of the REE in the underclay samples analyzed here are bound in the residual phase (Table 7) and not extractable by exchange, or dissolution using 1 M HCl, or warm (70 \u2022 C) 1.2 M H 2 SO 4 . The complete set of analytical results for the sequential digests are shown in the Table S3 in the Supplementary Materials. The (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 exchangeable fraction of REE in the samples ranged from 0.3-7.5% and are low but generally fall within a range of other published values for ion-exchangeable REE in CentApp coal and coal byproducts [6,29,30], with the exception of the values reported by Rozelle et al.

Both samples contain ~25-35% of the total REE in the exchangeable and HCl leached fraction (Figure 3). This fraction is likely comprised of REE bound to the surface of clay minerals, carbonates, and Fe-oxides. While the remaining REE is bound to phosphatic minerals or within the structure of more recalcitrant phases and may only be recovered using hot sulfuric acid or more destructive dissolution techniques such as microwave digestion or treatment with hydrofluoric acid. The concentration of REE in the HCl extracts may be higher in these samples due to the abundance of metal oxides that may bind colloidal ions or carbonate that may have ion adsorbed/exchangeable REE (See Table 8). The concentration of REE and gangue elements in leachates recovered from sequential extraction were compared to bench-top leaching experiments with citrate, and the results are shown in Figure 3 and Table 8. Ammonium sulfate used for recovery of ion exchangeable leached ~10 \u00b5g of REE or approximately 7% of the total REE present in UC-02 (Figure 3 and Table 8), other samples tested had low recovery (<10% of the total REE) when using ammonium sulfate. Citrate leaching using a cycle of citrate solution amended with NaCl (pH 5) leached ~45 \u00b5g of REE into the PLS. This amount correlates to nearly 33% of the total REE in the clay sample. Two different slurry concentrations using sample UC-02, 1 and 10%, were leached with citrate + NaCl. The results of the comparison are shown in Table S5.",

One plausible explanation for the greater recovery of REE from citrate + sodium chloride treatment compared to ammonium sulfate is the effect of solution electrolyte concentration on dispersion of clay grains [31,32]. Sodium chloride amended citrate may balance surface charge and increase total dissolved solids (TDS) conductivity in the leachate that may enhance colloid and particle dispersion [32]. We hypothesize that an increase in clay particle dispersion would lead to increased solution-clay grain interaction and higher recovery. However, the citrate anion leaches a greater fraction of REE than simply the exchangeable fraction, determined by (NH4)2SO4. It is plausible that exchangeable RE concentrations in these samples are low and do not exceed more than 10% and that citrate liberates an additional fraction of the RE that is not exchangeable and not liberated by ammonium sulfate. Future work will be aimed at optimizing the solution in order to determine if additional mechanisms are at work where clay grains or RE mineral bearing phases are more susceptible to solubilization in the presence of citrate, compared to mineral acids or inorganic salts such as ammonium sulfate.",

                        "The concentration of REE and gangue elements in the different leachates from tests conducted on the Middle Kittanning underclay (UC-02) are shown in Table 8. The highest concentration of REE was released (during leaching using one single solution) by leaching with 0.1 M citrate solution amended with NaCl (solution RS-2). The high concentration of Al, Si, and Fe released from samples UC-01 and 06 during treatment with RS-2 leach solution indicates some dissolution of the mineral phases in these samples, as Si is not typically present as an exchangeable ion. The presence of weakly crystalline, amorphous phases and water-soluble species may also contribute to the higher release of these elements. Whether or not the solution can leach REE from refractory or phosphatic minerals such as monazite was not clear. Notably, the citrate PLS from leaching of UC-02 contained measurable P. Further testing is required to evaluate the leachability of these phases using a citrate or other organic acid-based solution. The recovery results for the different solutions tested indicate that the organic acid solution Na-citrate buffered citric acid (solution RS-2) leaches a greater mass of REE compared to ammonium sulfate (Table 8 and Figure 4), in some cases citrate leaching exceeds leaching with inorganic mineral acids (see Figure 4 and Tables S4 andS5).  Citrate + sodium chloride leaching solution (RS-2) and the other citrate-based solutions tested released a higher concentration of base cations-Al, Si, and Fe-than ammonium sulfate (SEQ-1) but far less than the concentrations of cations released by low-pH inorganic mineral acids (Table 8, Table S3). The ratio of REE to base cations in the leachate accounts for the proportion of REE recovered to the proportion of \"contaminants\" such as cations Si, Al, and Fe. In recovering 45.9 \u00b5g of REE, RS-2, a citrate solution at pH 5, had a REE to base cation ratio of 2.5, compared to a significantly lower value of 0.3-0.2 for the acid and heat-based recovery solutions tested during the sequential extraction. The citrate solution (RS-2) performed best, based on the quantity of REE recovered and the reduction in the concentration of base cations and radioactive Th in the leachate. The citrate + sodium chloride solution, had a significantly higher recovery of REE than (NH4)2SO4 from all three different underclay materials tested (Table 8, Tables S2 andS3). Citrate + sodium chloride leaching solution (RS-2) and the other citrate-based solutions tested released a higher concentration of base cations-Al, Si, and Fe-than ammonium sulfate (SEQ-1) but far less than the concentrations of cations released by low-pH inorganic mineral acids (Table 8, Table S3).

                        "The citrate solution leached greater than 30% of the total Ce, La, Nd, Eu, Gd, and Dy from samples 02 and 03. Leaching from UC-06 was significantly less than the other samples, apart from cobalt. For sample UC-02, both Cu, Y, and Pb are abundant in the leachate. Leaching of the radioactive element Th is low in PLS from samples UC-02 and 06, less than 3% of the total Th in the solid. Th leaching from sample UC-01 is nearly 8\u00d7 that from the other samples. The concentration of Th in UC-01 starting solid material was lowest of the samples tested, 14 \u00b5g/g, compared to the concentration of Th in UC-02 and 06 which was 22 and 24 \u00b5g/g respectively (see Figure 5 and Table S3). The difference in Th leaching between the samples may be due to the mineral associations of Th in the different clay strata or formations. Notably, there is evidence that Th leaching is minimum, with less than 3% of the total leached from the clay when using citrate for leaching. Reducing Th in leachates, as well as other elements such as U, can help to reduce costs associated with waste disposal and remediation.",

Conversely, calcium in the leachate increased with increasing pH. Sequential acid digestions indicate that a majority of the REE are bound in mineral phases in the residual pool and are not extractable by (NH4)2SO4, 1 M HCl, or 1.2 M H2SO4. The exceptions are for samples UC-02 and UC-03 which have a greater proportion of REE bound as exchangeable or extractable using hydrochloric and sulfuric acid. At different pH values, range 3-6, there is a reduction in the concentration of gangue in the leachates (Figure 6). The solution can be pH buffered across a range of pH vales from 3-6 which allows for selective leaching of elements from the material. Leaching of non-REE base cations decreases with increasing pH and provides a system to selectively leach REE and minimize leaching of Al, Si, and Fe. Increasing pH should yield greater chelation recovery due to the increase in the number of deprotonated anion sites associated with pKa values for citric acid [12,13]. This is likely due to the monodentate bonding of the REE-citrate complex which is typical of the citrate-metal ion complex [12][13][14]. This bonding regime is the strongest of the bonds associated with chelation/complexation to carboxylic acid, the functional group on the citrate molecule [14]. There is little change in the concentration of REE in the citrate leachate across pH range 3-6 (see Figure 5, Table S7), which crosses two pKa boundaries for citric acid (e.g., 3.1, 4.7). At pH 4.7, a second carboxylic acid group becomes deprotonated. If this functional group could attract an additional RE ion, there should be a commensurate increase in REE concentration observed between pH 4 and 5 leachates. However, since there is little to no change in REE concentration across the range of pH it is likely the complexation of REE-citrate is more influenced by other factors such as saturation of the We evaluated how the pH of the leaching solution impacts the release of REE and gangue elements from samples UC-02 and UC-03 at a range of pH values from 3 to 6.

                        "The preliminary results from the bench-top experiments indicate that citrate is a chemically effective lixiviant that can be used to generate a PLS from clay-rich sedimentary rock. Presumably, REE and other ionically bound base cations that are present on clay surfaces are solubilized via complexation/chelation with the carboxylic functional group on the citrate anion. Simple chelation/complexation using the citrate anion in solution at pH 5 reduces the potential for dissolution of crystalline mineral phases and concurrent release of elements gangue elements. Such is the case with refractory minerals such as monazite and xenotime that are not only sources of REE but also radioactive elements Th and U. The process presented here is not aimed at leaching of crystalline bound, phosphatic REE. Rather, REE is sorbed to the surface of mineral grains that can be recovered with basic hydrometallurgical leaching.",
                        "The citrate PLS generated in the experiments contains a relatively low concentration of gangue elements because of the limited mineral dissolution. The overall economics of the process cannot be assessed at this stage of the research or at the scale of this work. However, future experiments and analysis will be aimed at evaluating the economics of the process including subsequent steps to purify REE from the PLS. Currently there are few processes that have been developed at a higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL) on the extraction and recovery of REE from secondary products and wastes.    Increased recoveries of the REE in the effluent solutions of the underclay powders were evident after increased shut-in times. Peak concentrations increased from the initial start of fluid flow to the samples flowed at 24 h (after ~17-h shut-in period) to the samples flowed at 5 days. An example of the effect shut-in time has on the liberation of REE into solution is shown in Figures 6 and7.  Results from these initial flow-through experiments highlight the considerations and parameters that need to be optimized to maximize the extraction of REE from underclay feedstocks using an organic lixiviant such as a sodium citrate solution. The flow-through experiments demonstrate that the initial 20-40 min of flow is the most critical for recovering the highest concentrations of the REE. Additional flow beyond that initial 20-40 min recovers significantly lower concentrations of the REE and may not be economical. The relatively quick release of REE in the first 20-40 min of fluid flow is consistent with our hypotheses that the sodium citrate solution targets the sorbed/colloidal components of the underclays. Increased shut-in times of the fluid with the underclay sample at pressure also led to increased concentrations in the PLS. The highest concentrations of REE in PLS produced came after a 5-day shut-in period. Notably, after these extended shut-in periods, the highest concentrations of the REE were still observed as occurring in the first 20-40 min of fluid flow. We suggest that the mechanism of REE extraction remains the same as in the powder benchtop tests, i.e., desorption from clay surfaces and/or complexation of ions from colloidal phases, but that the  The highest concentrations of REE were observed in effluents after a 5-day shut-in period. In Figure 6, the initial opening of the reactor, after 5 days, occurs at 0 min. Subsequent measurements were taken at 20, 40, and 60 min after flow was established. The highest concentration of REE in the leachate occurred at 20 min after reestablishing flow (Figure 7). Additionally, the pregnant leach solutions exhibit middle-to heavy-REE enrichments.",

These observations are consistent between the powdered samples and the fractured core experiments. However, extraction efficiencies for the flow-through experiment were low, <1% of the total REE content, and likely due to the lower liquid-solid ratio and decreased contact between solution and material due to low transmissivity of the fluid through the material. Increasing the extraction efficiencies for flow-through applications remains an area of active research and further development and testing of a flow-through method that could eventually be employed at the field scale for in situ solution mining is necessary."

Sorbent capture is a promising technology for the recovery of a high purity REE fraction from PLS, including citrate-based solutions. In conventional mining operations of the REE, the PLS is subjected to a series of purification steps to remove impurities such as Fe, Al, P, and Th (i.e., gangue elements) before the REE can be recovered [33,34]. While these downstream processes are still an area of active research for the citrate solutions described herein, there are a number of potential pathways that include the use of a novel amine-based sorbent to selectively recover the REE. In order to process the pregnant leachate solution for the recovery of a high purity REE fraction, the leachate is passed over a bed of sorbent material [34]. After leaching, the PLS is passed over a bed of sorbent material [35]. During capture, alkali and alkaline earth elements, as well as the lixiviant, pass through the bed while gangue elements (e.g., Al, Si, Fe, and Th) and REE bind to the bed. Once bound to the sorbent bed, the REE is selectively eluted, away from the gangue elements to produce high purity REE fraction [33,35,36].",
                        "In a separate series of laboratory experiments we produced and tested the ability to capture REE from a citrate-based PLS and simultaneously remove gangue elements from the leachate. A citrate PLS-from the leaching of coal prep plant fines with the citrate leaching solution RS-2-was used. The initial, unoptimized sorbent capture test using the citrate PLS showed approximately 60-70% uptake of REE from the feed solution, up through holmium, with a bias toward the light and middle rare earth elements in the unoptimized recovery of bound REE from the sorbent. The overall recovery for the light and middle REE was found to be 80-100% for elements lanthanum to dysprosium, while the recovery ranged from 50-70% for MREE and HREE, with the greatest recovery in this subset occurring with holmium. These results show great promise toward the concentration of REE from a citrate-based PLS generated by leaching of clay-rich geologic material. Future work will be aimed at using the solid sorbent to remove all base metals and other elements from the citrate lixiviant in order to recycle the solution and reuse multiple cycles of leaching. Reuse of the lixiviant during sequential cycles will add cost savings to the process. When coupled with the use of solid polymer sorbents to recover and concentrate REE, citrate leaching may be a promising method for the leaching and concentration of REE from clay-rich coal mine waste rock and coal preparation plant refuse."

                "Underclay associated with coal seams in the Lower Freeport, Middle Kittanning, and Pittsburgh formations contain REE concentrations ranging from 250-353 ppm. Clay minerals such as illite, halloysite, and kaolinite are the predominant clay minerals that make up >55% of the total bulk mineralogy of the rock. The introduction of leaching solutions into underclay rock powder initiates chemical reactions such as ion exchange, hydrolysis, and mineral dissolution that result in the release of ion constituents into the citrate PLS. Bench-top leaching and flow-through experimental results indicate that citrate is a chemically effective molecule for leaching weakly bound REE or other elements of interest from clay-rich sedimentary rock. Rare earths and other metal elements may exist as water soluble, ion exchangeable, or ion/colloidal where the REE is adsorbed to clay or other minerals such as metal oxyhydroxides that are present in the rock. The properties of the citrate molecule provide an added benefit of pH-controlled selectivity against leaching gangue elements from the rock matrix. The process of using organic acid anions for chelation and complexation of target elements is a promising method to leach REE and other critical metals from a variety of different sedimentary lithologies (e.g., underclay, sandstone, and shale) and produced materials such as coal mining waste and coal preparation plant refuse. A chief advantage of the citrate leaching technology is the demonstrated ability to recover REE from feedstocks with minimal release of gangue and radioactive elements, using an environmentally benign and relatively cost-effective leaching solution.",

Bench top powder leach and the flow-through experiments conducted here provide first-order results on the efficacy of organic acid anions for leaching of REE and other elements. Additionally, the results provide observational data on the minimal impact the leaching has on the physical structure of the rock because of the likelihood that there is minimal dissolution of the rock matrix when leaching with citrate at a pH range of 3-6. Continuing work will be aimed toward maximizing the extraction efficiency of the organic acid-based citrate leaching solution. As described in the methods, a total accounting by mass of the extracted REE from flow-through experiments was not possible but estimates of the extraction efficiency of the system remain low, <1% of the total REE content for the underclay samples. Comparatively, benchtop experiments where powdered underclay samples were reacted with sodium citrate solution at 1% and 10% solids (e.g., Table S5) demonstrated leaching up to ~30% of the total REE. Future work using flow-through experiments will explore parameters such as increasing the leach solution ratio of fluids reacting with the underclay samples, the concentration of the sodium citrate solution, and sampling schemes such as a step-wise shut-in reaction. Information gained from these results and the guided work of future studies will aid in developing a technology economic evaluation of the process to determine costs associated with upscaling this technology for use in larger scale operations."
