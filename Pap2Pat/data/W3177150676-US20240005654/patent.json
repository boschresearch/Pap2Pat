The computation engine may execute the AI model to analyze the image to output a result.

AI models may utilize machine learning (ML), which typically involves training an AI model with training data to produce a trained model able to generalize properties of data based on similar patterns with the training data. Training the model may involve learning model parameters by optimizing an objective function, thus optimizing a likelihood of observing the training data given the model. Given variabilities in the training data, the extent of training samples within the training data, and other limitations to training, and the complexity of modern AI models, it is often difficult to explain certain results that appear erratic or fail to meet expectations."

                        "In general, the disclosure describes various aspects of techniques for facilitating evaluation of results produced by artificial intelligence. More specifically, various aspects of the techniques described in this disclosure may enable error-based explanations for artificial intelligence (AI) behavior (such as visual question answering (VQA) model behavior). Rather than simply providing an answer (in the example context of a VQA model), the VQA model may also identify which parts of an image were difficult for the VQA model to analyze (e.g., the parts of the image toward which the \u201cattention\u201d of the VQA model was erroneously drawn) in order to provide the answer, thereby potentially providing an error-based explanation that enables a user of the VQA model to evaluate a reason for the answer to assess confidence in the VQA model or otherwise gain a better understanding of limitations of the VQA model.",
                        "In addition, various aspects of the techniques may enable the VQA model to synthesize the error map with a so-called attention map in order to obtain a helpfulness metric. The VQA model may generate the attention map as a function of attention scores identified while processing the input image. The VQA model may overlay the attention map on the image to produce an attention map image that may identify which portions (e.g., image features) the VQA model identified as relevant in producing the answer. VQA model may also output this helpfulness metric to facilitate user understanding of how the VQA model reached the answer. As the VQA model produces this helpfulness metric in part based on the error map, the helpfulness metric may provide an additional form of error-based explanation.",
                        "In this respect, various aspects of the techniques may provide various benefits that improve operation of the VQA model. For example, by outputting the error-based explanation along with the answer, the VQA model may better explain how the answer to a given inquiry was determined, thereby providing a more comprehensive and/or informative user experience that facilitates user trust and understanding of the VQA model. Further, by revealing limitations in the form of an error map (which is one example of a form of error-based explanation), the VQA model may delineate where further training may be useful to improve operation of the VQA model itself (where, in some instances, the VQA model may automatically perform unguided training responsive to user feedback indicating a given answer is unsupported by the error-based explanation).",

                        "Machine learning may generally enable a computing system to analyze input data and identify an action to be performed or predict an output responsive to the input data (such as providing a given answer). Each machine learning model may be trained using training data that reflects likely input data. The training data may be labeled or unlabeled (meaning that the correct action to be taken based on a sample of training data is explicitly stated or not explicitly stated, respectively). The training of the machine learning model may be guided (in that a designer, such as a computer programmer, may direct the training to guide the machine learning model to identify the correct action in view of the input data) or unguided (in that the machine learning model is not guided by a designer to identify the correct action in view of the input data). In some instances, the machine learning model is trained through a combination of labeled and unlabeled training data, a combination of guided and unguided training, or possibly combinations thereof.",
                        "Even when the machine learning model undergoes guided training with labeled training data (which may represent what might be considered the most directed training that should result in more expected actions compared to unguided training using unlabeled training data or various combinations thereof), there are limits to training the machine learning model as such training is not often exhaustive (in terms of fully sampling each feature of the space defined by the input data). In other words, there may be limited training data that may not fully address the wider variability of the input data.",
                        "Further, a potential benefit of machine learning models is to avoid exhaustive and time-consuming comprehensive training but still produce a machine learning model that performs accurate action identification (which is another way of referring to a \u201cdecision\u201d) through limited sampled training. As such, the resulting machine learning module may operate erratically (selecting surprising or unforeseen actions) in the context of certain (possibly unforeseen or unlikely) input data for which there were only limited (or no) samples in the training data or for which training was not fully performed.",
                        "Given the complexity of the machine learning model, it may be difficult to explain in detail a basis upon which the machine learning model identified the various results, particularly when such actions appear to be erratic or unexpected. To illustrate, consider an example of a machine learning model that implements a deep neural network, which may include three or more layers of neural networks, and which is trained using training data to identify an action. Attempting to explain how each neural network layer of the deep neural network weighed each aspect of the input data to identify what may be considered an erratic action may entail significant analysis and understanding of the training data, the input data, or combinations thereof.",
                        "As another example, consider a virtual question answering (VQA) model that includes one or more machine learning algorithms configured to support different aspects of the VQA model. Generally, the VQA model may receive as inputs an image and a query regarding the image (typically in the form of audio data representative of speech defining the query). The VQA model may include a bidirectional encoder representations from transformations (BERT) model to encode the query and the image into respective query features and image features coupled with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the query features and the image features to identify a result (or, in other words, an answer). The VQA model may process the query features (which may also be referred to as keywords) relative to the image features to identify an answer to the query. The complexity of the CNN (and to a lesser degree the BERT model) and how each layer of the CNN weights each of the image features may be considered an erratic action that may entail significant analysis and understanding of the training data, the input data (both the audio data and the image), or combinations thereof.",
                        "That is, machine learning-based systems (which is another way of referring to an artificial intelligence model) may be considered to largely operate as a black box with little visibility into causes for operational outcomes output by the machine learning-based systems. Such operational outcomes may refer to diagnostic/prognostic decision in data analytics, control decision in autonomous systems and other predictive inferences or, in other words, results produced by such machine learning-based systems. Consider a so-called black-box machine learning system deployed in a car parts factory for product quality assurance by way of visual camera inspection. In this example system, an engineer may encounter a problem of certain products on the assembly line being classified as defective. The block-box machine learning system may not, however, provide evidence used in such decision. Likewise, some of the analyzed parts may be classified as acceptable by the black-box machine learning system, even though an engineer notices suspicious features and would like to inspect decision making processes of the black-box machine learning system.",
                        "Various aspects of the techniques described in this disclosure facilitate the explanation of artificial intelligence that operate according to machine learning models. The techniques may enable a computing system to provide one or more of error-based explanations, attention-based explanations, or a hybrid explanation that combines error-based explanations with attention-based explanations (which may be referred to as a helpfulness metric) for artificial intelligence behavior (such as visual question answering (VQA) behavior). Rather than simply provide an answer (in the example context of a VQA model), the VQA model may also identify which aspects of an underlying image were difficult to analyze (e.g., in error-based explanations), which aspects of the underlying image were relied upon to reach the answer (e.g., in attention-based explanations), or a combination of which aspects of the underlying image were both difficult to analyze and correctly relied upon to reach the answer.",
                        "In this manner, various aspects of the techniques potentially provide one or more of an error-based explanation, an attention-based explanation, and/or a helpfulness explanation. In each instance, various aspects of the techniques may enable a user of the VQA model to evaluate a reason for the answer to assess confidence in the model or otherwise gain a better understanding of limitations of the VQA model.",
                        "In this respect, various aspects of the techniques may provide various benefits that improve operation of the VQA model itself. For example, by outputting the error-based explanation along with the answer, the VQA model may better explain how the VQA model had difficulty generating the answer to provide a more comprehensive user experience that facilitates user trust and understanding of the VQA model. Further, by revealing such limitations, the VQA model may delineate where further training may be useful to improve operation of the VQA model itself. This may be particularly useful where, in some instances, the VQA model may automatically perform unguided training responsive to user feedback indicating a given answer is unsupported by the attention-based explanation.",
                        "In the car parts assembly example above, to provide a better context in which to assess the benefits, the various aspects of the techniques may provide an analytic explanation that potentially identifies features and/or components of the parts that form a basis for a faulty operation outcome output by the black-box machine learning system. Another use scenario may involve a physician assistant tasked with running a machine learning system for diagnosing medical conditions of a patient vital organs based on medical imaging data, e.g., a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image. The machine learning system may classify the image as normal, abnormal, and/or pathological. Counterintuitive or high-risk classification results would naturally cause a desire on the part of the user to understand the decision path that the system takes in order to produce the results.",
