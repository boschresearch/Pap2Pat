                "This invention relates to the treatment of tumours and cancer using a combination of chemotherapeutic agents and immunocytokines.",
                "Conventional cytotoxic therapies of cancer often do not discriminate between tumour and normal tissues. To achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in the tumour mass, large drug doses have to be administered to the patient, leading to a poor therapeutic index and unacceptable toxicities to healthy tissues N. The selective delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumour site using antibodies directed against tumour-associated antigens is a strategy to overcome the disadvantages of conventional cancer therapies [2, 3, 4]. Antigens that are expressed around the tumour neovasculature are especially attractive targets for antibody-based pharmacodelivery applications due to their inherent accessibility for blood-borne agents and to the fact that angiogenesis is a characteristic feature of virtually all aggressive solid tumours [5, 6, 7].",
                "Tenascin-C is a large hexameric glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix which modulates cellular adhesion. It is involved in processes such as cell proliferation and cell migration and is associated with changes in tissue architecture as occurring during morphogenesis and embryogenesis as well as under tumourigenesis or angiogenesis.",
                "A strong over-expression of the large isoform of tenascin-C has been reported for a number of tumours, and monoclonal antibodies specific for domains A1 and D, respectively, have been extensively characterised in the clinic [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Human monoclonal antibody fragments specific to tenascin-C are described in WO2006/050834 and shown to bind preferentially to tumour tissue relative to normal tissue. These antibodies are useful, for example, in delivering toxins, such as cytokines, specifically to tumour cells.",
                "Delivery of bioactive agents to the subendothelial extracellular matrix has been demonstrated using derivatives of monoclonal antibodies specific to splice isoforms of fibronectin or of tenascin-C [5, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In particular, promising results obtained with derivatives of the human monoclonal antibodies L19 (specific to the alternatively spliced ED-B domain of fibronectin) and F16 (specific to the extra-domain A1 of tenascin-C) have led to the clinical development of five immunocytokines and radioimmunoconjugates, based on these antibodies [7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22]. F16 is also known as 4A1-F16.",
                "L19 specifically binds the ED-B domain of fibronectin isoform B-FN, which is one of the best known markers of angiogenesis (U.S. Ser. No. 10/382,107, WO01/62298). ED-B is an extra domain of 91 amino acids found in the B-FN isoform and is identical in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and man. B-FN accumulates around neovascular structures in aggressive tumours and other tissues undergoing angiogenesis, such as the endometrium in the proliferative phase and some ocular structures in pathological conditions, but is otherwise undetectable in normal adult tissues (19, 23, 24). ScFv(L19) has been shown to be capable of selective tumour targeting in patients with cancer [16]. Use of immunocytokines comprising L19 conjugated with IL-12 is described in WO2006/119897.",
                "F16 and F16-IL2 have been shown to intensely stain aggressive cancer types and to preferentially accumulate at the tumour site following intravenous administration [22, 25]. Following observation of its excellent safety profile observed in cynomolgus monkeys, F16-IL2 is currently being studied in two phase Ib clinical trials in combination with doxorubicin or with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic cancer.",
                "Central nervous system tumours rank first among neoplasia types for the average years of life lost [26]. Approximately 13,000 deaths and 18,000 new cases of central nervous system tumours occur annually in the US [27]. Mortality rates are generally similar to incidence rates in most geographical areas [28].",
                "The standard of care for patients with glioblastoma includes surgery, radiotherapy and/or temozolomide-based pharmacotherapy. Nevertheless, the prognosis of glioblastoma continues to be dismal, in spite of progress made in the molecular characterisation of the most frequent genetic alterations found in this disease.",
                "Microvascular proliferation is a characteristic feature of glioblastoma [35]. A striking over-expression of the EDB domain of fibronectin in high-grade astrocytomas has been unequivocally established [29; 30] and the monoclonal antibody L19 has been shown to target glioblastoma in patients [31]. Furthermore, radiolabelled preparations of monoclonal antibodies specific to the A1 or to the D domain of tenascin-C have been investigated for the radioimmunotherapy of patients with glioblastoma [32].",
                "Bartolomei et al. [33] described treatment of glioblastoma patients with radioimmunotherapy, using biotinylated anti-tenascin murine monoclonal antibody, avidin and 90Y-biotin, in combination with temozolomide. Overall survival and progression free survival of patients receiving the combined treatment were observed to be higher compared with patients who received radioimmunotherapy without temozolomide.",
                "The inventors have observed that the combination of an alkylating agent with an antibody-IL2 conjugate targeted to a tumour-associated antigen of the tumour neovasculature exhibited more effective therapeutic action against the tumour compared with the use of the alkylating agent or the conjugate alone.",
                "F16-IL2 is shown herein to potentiate the therapeutic action of the alkylating agent temozolomide in mice models of human glioblastoma. A synergistic effect was observed for the combination of temozolomide and F16-IL2, which produced an anti-tumour effect much greater than would have been expected based on the effects of F16-IL2 or temozolomide alone. Subcutaneous U87 glioblastomas were completely eradicated in nude mice using the combination treatment, compared with only a minor retardation of tumour growth observed for F16-IL2 treatment alone and a recurrence of tumour growth following regression in mice treated with temozolomide alone.",
                "Aspects of the first development of the invention are as follows.",
                "Accordingly, a first development of the invention relates to the combined use of a chemotherapeutic alkylating agent and an immunocytokine for treating a tumour, where the immunocytokine comprises a cytokine (e.g. an interleukin such as IL2) conjugated with an antibody molecule, wherein the antibody molecule binds a target antigen, e.g. tumour-associated antigen and/or antigen of the tumour neovasculature.",

The glioma may be glioblastoma.",
                "As disclosed here, the inventors have discovered that a combination of a chemotherapeutic agent with an antibody-cytokine conjugate exhibits more effective therapeutic action against glioma compared with the use of the chemotherapeutic agent or the conjugate alone. By using a therapeutic regimen of combined administration of an immunocytokine with chemotherapy, the therapeutic activity of the immunocytokine and chemotherapeutic agent can be significantly increased. These findings are of particular value for therapy of glioblastoma, which is a devastating disease with very poor prognosis, and for which there is currently no definitive cure.",

Alkylating agents may attach alkyl groups, e.g. methyl groups, to DNA bases. This may result in DNA fragmentation, cross-linking between DNA strands and/or DNA mutation. Examples of alkylating agents include:",

As exemplified in the experimental examples herein, the alkylating agent may be temozolomide, i.e. (8-carbamoyl-3-methylimidazo[5,1-d]-1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4(3H)-one). Temozolomide is a prodrug and is chemically related to dacarbazine but, unlike dacarbazine, it spontaneously hydrolyzes to the intermediate species methyltriazen-1-yl imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC) MTIC above pH 7 without requiring metabolism by the liver. MTIC degrades to an active cation, which methylates guanines in DNA at the O6 position. Temozolomide and its use as a chemotherapeutic agent is described in ref. [34].",

SEQ ID NO: 11 is the precursor sequence including an N-terminal signal peptide of 20 amino acids. Mature human IL2, lacking the signal peptide is residues 21 to 153 of SEQ ID NO: 11, and this mature sequence is set out in SEQ ID NO: 19. The IL2 moiety of the immunocytokine may comprise a sequence of all or part of the IL2 amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 11, e.g. all or part of the IL2 amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 19. A preferred IL2 sequence comprises SEQ ID NO: 19.",

Sequence identity is commonly defined with reference to the algorithm GAP (Wisconsin GCG package, Accelerys Inc, San Diego USA). GAP uses the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm to align two complete sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. Generally, default parameters are used, with a gap creation penalty=12 and gap extension penalty=4. Use of GAP may be preferred but other algorithms may be used, e.g. BLAST (which uses the method of Altschul et al. [40]), FASTA (which uses the method of Pearson and Lipman [41]), or the Smith-Waterman algorithm [42], or the TBLASTN program, of Altschul et al. [40], generally employing default parameters. In particular, the psi-Blast algorithm [43] may be used. Sequence identity may be determined with reference to the full length of a sequence set out herein.",

In preferred embodiments, the immunocytokine may be a fusion protein comprising the cytokine, e.g. IL2, and the antibody molecule or a polypeptide component thereof (e.g. a heavy chain or a light chain of an antibody or multi-chain antibody fragment, such as a Fab). Thus, for example, the cytokine moiety may be fused to a VH domain or VL domain of the antibody. Typically the antibody molecule, or component thereof, and cytokine moiety are joined via a peptide linker, e.g. a peptide of about 5-25 residues, e.g. 10-20 residues, preferably about 15 residues. Suitable examples of peptide linkers are well known in the art. In some embodiments, a linker may have an amino acid sequence as set out in SEQ ID NO: 12. Normally, the linker has an amino acid sequence comprising one or more tandem repeats of a motif. Typically the motif is a five residue sequence, and preferably at least 4 of the residues are Gly or Ser. Where four of the five residues is Gly or Ser, the other residue may be Ala. More preferably each of the five residues is Gly or Ser. Preferred motifs are GGGGS, SSSSG, GSGSA and GGSGG. Preferably, the motifs are adjacent in the sequence, with no intervening nucleotides between the repeats. The linker sequence may comprise or consist of between one and five, preferably three or four, repeats of the motif.

                                "A dAb (domain antibody) is a small monomeric antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, namely the variable region of an antibody heavy or light chain [48]. VH dAbs occur naturally in camelids (e.g. camel, llama) and may be produced by immunizing a camelid with a target antigen, isolating antigen-specific B cells and directly cloning dAb genes from individual B cells. dAbs are also producible in cell culture. Their small size, good solubility and temperature stability makes them particularly physiologically useful and suitable for selection and affinity maturation. Camelid VH dAbs are being developed for therapeutic use under the name \u201cNanobodies\u2122\u201d. An antibody molecule of the present invention may be a dAb. The antibody molecule comprise a VH or VL domain substantially as set out herein, or a VH or VL domain comprising a set of CDRs substantially as set out herein.",
                                "As used herein, the phrase \u201csubstantially as set out\u201d refers to the characteristic(s) of the relevant CDRs of the VH or VL domain of antibody molecules described herein will be either identical or highly similar to the specified regions of which the sequence is set out herein. As described herein, the phrase \u201chighly similar\u201d with respect to specified region(s) of one or more variable domains, it is contemplated that from 1 to about 5, e.g. from 1 to 4, including 1 to 3, or 1 or 2, or 3 or 4, amino acid substitutions may be made in the CDR and/or VH or VL domain.",
                                "Bispecific or bifunctional antibodies form a second generation of monoclonal antibodies in which two different variable regions are combined in the same molecule [55]. Their use has been demonstrated both in the diagnostic field and in the therapy field from their capacity to recruit new effector functions or to target several molecules on the surface of tumour cells. Where bispecific antibodies are to be used, these may be conventional bispecific antibodies, which can be manufactured in a variety of ways [56], e.g. prepared chemically or from hybrid hybridomas, or may be any of the bispecific antibody fragments mentioned above. These antibodies can be obtained by chemical methods [57, 58] or somatic methods [59, 60] but likewise and preferentially by genetic engineering techniques which allow the heterodimerization to be forced and thus facilitate the process of purification of the antibody sought [61]. Examples of bispecific antibodies include those of the BiTE\u2122 technology in which the binding domains of two antibodies with different specificity can be used and directly linked via short flexible peptides. This combines two antibodies on a short single polypeptide chain. Diabodies and scFv can be constructed without an Fc region, using only variable domains, potentially reducing the effects of anti-idiotypic reaction.",
                                "Bispecific antibodies can be constructed as entire IgG, as bispecific Fab\u20322, as Fab\u2032PEG, as diabodies or else as bispecific scFv. Further, two bispecific antibodies can be linked using routine methods known in the art to form tetravalent antibodies.",
                                "Bispecific diabodies, as opposed to bispecific whole antibodies, may also be particularly useful because they can be readily constructed and expressed in E. coli. Diabodies (and many other polypeptides, such as antibody fragments) of appropriate binding specificities can be readily selected using phage display (WO94/13804) from libraries. If one arm of the diabody is to be kept constant, for instance, with a specificity directed against the antigen of the tumour neovasculature, then a library can be made where the other arm is varied and an antibody of appropriate specificity selected. Bispecific whole antibodies may be made by alternative engineering methods as described in Ridgeway et al., 1996 [62].",
                                "Various methods are available in the art for obtaining antibodies against a target antigen. The antibodies may be monoclonal antibodies, especially of human, murine, chimeric or humanized origin, which can be obtained according to the standard methods well known to the person skilled in the art.",
                                "In general, for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies or their functional fragments, especially of murine origin, it is possible to refer to techniques which are described in particular in the manual \u201cAntibodies\u201d [63] or to the technique of preparation from hybridomas described by K\u00f6hler and Milstein [64].",
                                "Monoclonal antibodies can be obtained, for example, from an animal cell immunised against the target antigen or one of its fragments containing the epitope recognised by the monoclonal antibodies. Suitable fragments and peptides or polypeptides comprising them are described herein, and may be used to immunise animals to generate antibodies against a target antigen. Said antigen, or one of its fragments, can especially be produced according to the usual working methods, by genetic recombination starting with a nucleic acid sequence contained in the cDNA sequence coding for the antigen or fragment thereof, by peptide synthesis starting from a sequence of amino acids comprised in the peptide sequence of the antigen and/or fragment thereof.",
                                "The monoclonal antibodies can, for example, be purified on an affinity column on which the antigen or one of its fragments containing the epitope recognised by said monoclonal antibodies, has previously been immobilised. More particularly, the monoclonal antibodies can be purified by chromatography on protein A and/or G, followed or not followed by ion-exchange chromatography aimed at eliminating the residual protein contaminants as well as the DNA and the LPS, in itself, followed or not followed by exclusion chromatography on Sepharose gel in order to eliminate the potential aggregates due to the presence of dimers or of other multimers. In one embodiment, the whole of these techniques can be used simultaneously or successively."

An antigen binding site engineered in a structural region may be additional to, or instead of, an antigen binding site formed by sets of CDRs of a VH and VL domain. Where multiple antigen binding sites are present in an antibody molecule, they may bind the same antigen (target antigen), thereby increasing valency of the antibody molecule.

Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after injection of F16-IL2 (10 \u03bcg, 3.6 \u03bcCi per mouse). Organs were weighed and radioactivity was counted with a Packard Cobra gamma counter.
