    "title": "Combination of temozolomide with immunocytokine F16\u2013IL2 for the treatment of glioblastoma",
    "date": "2010-08-24",
    "abstract": "Glioblastoma patients are still not cured by the treatments available at the moment. We investigated the therapeutic properties of temozolomide in combination with F16\u2013IL2, a clinical-stage immunocytokine consisting of human interleukin (IL)-2 fused to the human antibody F16, specific to the A1 domain of tenascin-C. We conducted three preclinical therapy studies, using subcutaneous and intracranial U87MG glioblastoma tumours xenografted in BALB/c nude mice. The same therapeutic schedule was used, consisting of five total administrations every third day, of 0.525 mg temozolomide, 20 \u03bcg F16\u2013IL2, the combination, or the control solution. Immunohistochemical analysis of U87MG xenografts and of human glioblastoma specimens showed selective tumour staining of F16. A quantitative biodistribution confirmed the preferential tumour accumulation of radiolabelled F16\u2013IL2. In the study with subcutaneous xenografts, the combination of F16\u2013IL2 with temozolomide induced complete remission of the animals, which remained tumour free for over 160 days. The same treatment led to a consistent size reduction of intracranial xenografts and to a longer survival of animals. The immunocytokine promoted the recruitment of leukocytes into tumours of both models. The combined use of temozolomide with F16\u2013IL2 deserves clinical investigations, which will be facilitated by the excellent safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys, and by the fact that F16\u2013IL2 is in clinical trials in patients with cancer.",

F16\u2013IL2 was administered i.v. at 20\u2009\u03bcg doses (corresponding to 6.6\u2009\u03bcg of IL2).",
                        "Monotherapy treatment with F16\u2013IL2 led to a minor tumour growth retardation, compared with the control group of mice treated with saline 10% DMSO, whereas all mice in the temozolomide group exhibited a strong tumour regression by day 30 (Figure 2A). However, by day 45, tumours started to grow again in three out of five mice. By contrast, mice treated with the combination of F16\u2013IL2 plus temozolomide exhibited a complete remission and remained tumour free for over 160 days.",
                        "The toxicity of pharmacological treatments in tumour-bearing mice is commonly evaluated by a constant monitoring of weight loss. In this study, mice of the control group did not exhibit weight loss, whereas mice of the temozolomide, F16\u2013IL2, and F16\u2013IL2 plus temozolomide treatment groups exhibited a comparable profile of weight loss, which was at all time points below 9% (Supplementary Figure 2A).",
                        "Encouraged by the tumour eradication obtained in subcutaneous xenografts, we studied the therapeutic performance of F16\u2013IL2 and temozolomide in an intracranial model of glioblastoma, obtained by stereotactic injection of 5 \u00d7 104 U87MG cells into nude mice. The treatment schedule and doses were as for the subcutaneous model, but all mice were killed on day 25 from the start of therapy to allow a comparative evaluation of tumour burden for the four treatment groups. This time point was chosen as the end of the experiment (i.e., after killing all mice), as the first animal in the control group started to show signs of neurological damage. Mice of the combination therapy (F16\u2013IL2+temozolomide) exhibited the strongest therapeutic benefit, with an average tumour volume of 14\u2009mm3, compared with those of temozolomide alone (33.5\u2009mm3), F16\u2013IL2 alone (36.8\u2009mm3), and the control group (52\u2009mm3). Pairwise comparisons between the combination therapy group and temozolomide alone (P=0.009), F16\u2013IL2 alone (P=0.001), and the control group (P<0.001) were calculated using the two-tailed Student's t-test and showed significant results (Figure 2B). No signs of distress were observed in the animals during the entire treatment period.",
                        "We performed a further therapy experiment with intracranial glioblastoma-bearing mice to better evaluate the therapeutic benefit of F16\u2013IL2 plus temozolomide on a survival basis. Four groups of mice were treated with the same doses and schedule as for the previous studies and were killed at the first appearance of neurological damage from tumour growth or on detection of any treatment-related toxicities. The Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve confirms the higher therapeutic benefit for the F16\u2013IL2 plus temozolomide combination group (Figure 2C), with no augmented toxicity (Supplementary Figure 2B). Comparisons of the F16\u2013IL2 plus temozolomide group with the other therapeutic groups were performed with the log-rank test and showed significant results (combo vs TMZ: P<0.002; combo vs F16\u2013IL2: P<0.002; combo vs control: P<0.0001)."

                "In this article, we have reported on the therapeutic performance of immunocytokine F16\u2013IL2 and of temozolomide, alone and in combination, in subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts of U87MG human glioblastoma.",
                "For both subcutaneous and intracranial U87MG xenografted mice, the combination of F16\u2013IL2 with temozolomide gave the best therapeutic results without additional toxicity, compared with the drugs as single agents (Supplementary Figure 2). In the case of subcutaneous glioblastoma, F16\u2013IL2 potentiated the action of temozolomide, leading to complete tumour eradication in all mice 40 days after beginning the treatment, and to the total remission of animals, which remained tumour free for over 160 days (Figure 2A). In addition, in the intracranial model, the combination treatment was more efficacious, resulting in a 73% decrease in tumour volume 25 days after the start of therapy (Figure 2B), as well as in a longer survival of the animals (Figure 2C).",
                "In both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts, immunocytokine F16\u2013IL2 promoted the recruitment of immune effector cells into glioblastoma lesions (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3), in analogy to that previously observed in other immunocytokine therapies of mice with solid and haematological malignancies (Carnemolla et al, 2002; Halin et al, 2002, 2003; M\u00e5rlind et al, 2008; Schliemann et al, 2009). The infiltration of leukocytes was not observed in normal organs from the same mice, thus excluding a nonspecific inflammation caused by F16\u2013IL2 (Supplementary Figure 4). The selective accumulation of F16\u2013IL2 around tumour vascular structures in both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts (Figure 4), the focal recruitment of immune effector cells (Figure 3), and the therapeutic effect on glioblastoma tumours of the F16\u2013IL2 plus temozolomide combination therapy (Figure 2) support the anticancer role of effector cells stimulated by the immunocytokine.",
                "Our group has previously shown that, surprisingly, the therapeutic effect of IL2-based immunocytokines against murine tumours is identical in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice, and that NK cells are mainly responsible for the therapeutic action (Carnemolla et al, 2002; Halin et al, 2003; Ebbinghaus et al, 2005). By contrast, immunocytokines based on other cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, IL12, interferon-\u03b3, IL15, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) exhibit a clear dependence on T cells (Borsi et al, 2003; Halin et al, 2003; Ebbinghaus et al, 2005; Kaspar et al, 2007). To document further possible mechanisms for the antitumour activity of the immunosuppressive reagent temozolomide in association with the immunostimulatory immunocytokine F16\u2013IL2, we have studied apoptosis and cell proliferation in glioblastoma xenografts after three doses of the four treatments: combination of F16\u2013IL2 with temozolomide, F16\u2013IL2 alone, temozolomide alone, and saline 10% DMSO. Results show a clear increase in apoptosis and complete suppression of proliferation in the combination treatment group, thus supporting a cytostatic plus cytotoxic explanation of therapeutic efficacy (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 6).",
                "In our study, F16\u2013IL2 seems to be more effective as a single agent in the intracranial model, whereas the combination of F16\u2013IL2 with temozolomide shows a higher efficacy in the subcutaneous model (Figure 2). We have conducted two independent therapy experiments with the intracranial model (Figure 2B and C), which have confirmed both the therapeutic activity of F16\u2013IL2 on its own and the additive therapeutic benefit observed in combination with temozolomide. There are a number of reasons why the same tumour cells (U87MG) may respond differently to therapy when implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically (in this case, intracranially). One first cause may be that the subcutaneous therapy study started when tumour masses were rather big (300\u2009mm3; Figure 2A). In the intracranial study, no magnetic resonance imaging monitoring of lesion size at different time points was possible, but control experiments with the same tumour model suggest that lesions of \u223c1\u20132\u2009mm3 were present at day 12 from tumour cell implantation (when our therapy started). Moreover, we have observed in other mouse models of malignancies (melanoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, breast, and kidney cancer) that IL2-based immunocytokines may show a minimal therapeutic activity on their own, but strongly synergise with other therapeutic regimens, leading to complete tumour eradication (Schliemann et al, 2009; Balza et al, 2010; Frey et al, 2010; Giavazzi et al, manuscript in preparation). In other studies, IL2-based immunocytokines showed a very potent therapeutic activity even when used as a single agent (Carnemolla et al, 2002; Menrad and Menssen, 2005; M\u00e5rlind et al, 2008). Finally, different therapeutic activities in subcutaneous and orthotopic models of glioblastoma have previously been reported by other groups (Friedman et al, 1995; Blouw et al, 2003; Graf et al, 2003; Yamini et al, 2007).",
                "Two IL2-based immunocytokines (L19-IL2 and F16\u2013IL2) are currently being investigated in phase I and phase II clinical trials in patients with cancer (Neri and Bicknell, 2005). These fully human immunocytokines can be studied in immunocompetent mouse models of cancer only in an acute setting, as they become immunogenic after a few injections (Carnemolla et al, 2002). Furthermore, although L19 reacts with equal affinity with its cognate human and murine antigens (Pini et al, 1998; Fattorusso et al, 1999), F16 recognises only human and monkey antigens (but not the rodent counterpart; Brack et al, 2006; M\u00e5rlind et al, 2008), thereby avoiding the therapy experiment in a syngeneic tumour model. The predictable effect of IL2-based immunocytokines in immunocompetent patients would be broader and stronger in tumour suppression, because of the involvement of T-cell and B-cell activation. With regard to the role of the blood\u2013brain barrier in brain tumours, we have documented that the tumour-targeting ability of immunocytokine F16\u2013IL2 is comparable in subcutaneous and intracranial mouse xenografts (Figure 4).",
                "The results of this preclinical therapy study may justify the clinical evaluation of F16\u2013IL2 in combination with temozolomide for the treatment of human glioblastoma. F16\u2013IL2 has exhibited an excellent safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys and is currently being studied in two phase Ib clinical trials, in combination with doxorubicin (breast and ovarian cancer) or in combination with paclitaxel (breast and lung cancer)."
