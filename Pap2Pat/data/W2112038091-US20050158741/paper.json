    "title": "Identification of inhibitors of ribozyme self-cleavage in mammalian cells via high-throughput screening of chemical libraries",
    "date": "2006-03-23",
    "abstract": "We have recently described an RNA-only gene regulation system for mammalian cells in which inhibition of self-cleavage of an mRNA carrying ribozyme sequences provides the basis for control of gene expression. An important proof of principle for that system was provided by demonstrating the ability of one specific small molecule inhibitor of RNA self-cleavage, toyocamycin, to control gene expression in vitro and vivo. Here, we describe the development of the high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that led to the identification of toyocamycin and other molecules capable of inhibiting RNA self-cleavage in mammalian cells. To identify small molecules that can serve as inhibitors of ribozyme self-cleavage, we established a cell-based assay in which expression of a luciferase ( luc ) reporter is controlled by ribozyme sequences, and screened 58,076 compounds for their ability to induce luciferase expression. Fifteen compounds able to inhibit ribozyme self-cleavage in cells were identified through this screen. The most potent of the inhibitors identified were toyocamycin and 5-fluorouridine (FUR), nucleoside analogs carrying modifications of the 7-position and 5-position of the purine or pyrimidine bases. Individually, these two compounds were able to induce gene expression of the ribozyme-controlled reporter \u223c365-fold and 110-fold, respectively. Studies of the mechanism of action of the ribozyme inhibitors indicate that the compounds must be incorporated into RNA in order to inhibit RNA self-cleavage.",

                "The ability to ''exogenously'' control the expressiono f genes in mammalian cells has been ap owerful toolo f biomedicalr esearch (Gossen and Bujard 2002). Gene regulation technology has already played ac ritical role in efforts to understand the role of specific genep roducts in fundamental biological processes, in development, and in disease states. In the future,t he technology offers the opportunityt oh ave am ajori mpact in new areas of researcha nd medicine. To date, most commonly used gene regulation systems rely on the control of transcription (Gossen and Bujard1 992;Wang et al. 1994;Rivera et al. 1996;S uhr et al. 1998). More recently, the discovery of RNA interference and siRNAs has led to the development of novel strategiesf or controlling genee xpression that rely on the targeting of RNA ( Fire et al. 1998;M cManus and Sharp 2002). In the hopes of extending the application and utility of gene regulation technology, we have been interested in the development of new methodsf or controlling genee xpression that rely on the modulation of RNA selfcleavage rather than transcription. The basis for such a system is the incorporation of sequences encoding selfcleaving RNA motifs( i.e., ribozyme sequences) into a mammalian transcription unit, such that upon generation of the resulting mRNA,spontaneous ribozyme self-cleavage should lead to destruction of the mRNAa nd therefore no gene expression. Administration of agents capableo f inhibiting RNA self-cleavage should result in preservation of the intact mRNA and therefore reinstate (i.e., ''induce'') genee xpression( Fig. 1A).",
                "The two essential requirements of such an RNA-only gener egulation system are the availability of ribozyme sequences capableo fe fficient self-cleavage in mammalian cells when embeddedi na nm RNA transcript, and the availability of small molecules capableo fi nhibiting such self-cleavage in mammalian cells.W ith regard to the first requirement, we have recently testedalarge numbero f natural and synthetic ribozyme sequences for their ability to function in mammalian cells when embeddedi na n mRNAt ranscript. We were able to identify and further developamodified version of ah ammerhead ribozyme, derived from Schistosoma mansoni (Sm1), that is capable of extremely efficients elf-cleavage in mammalian cells (Yen et al. 2004). This ribozyme,t ermedN 79,w as foundt o function in av ariety of commonly used mammalian cell linesa nd in primaryc ells in vivo. An important proof of principle for the use of inhibitors of RNA self-cleavage to control geneexpressionwas providedbythe demonstration of the ability of one specific small molecule inhibitor of RNAself-cleavage, toyocamycin, to control gene expression in vitro and vivo. Here, we describe the development of the high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that led to the identificationo ft oyocamycina nd other inhibitors of RNA self-cleavage. Rather than rely on in vitro screens of compounds, we chose to develop am ammalian cell-based screeni no rder to directly identify molecules capableo f functioning within cells. Since av ariety of aminoglycoside (Stage et al. 1995;Murray and Arnold 1996;Hermann and Westhof 1998;Tor et al. 1998;Jenne et al. 2001) and nonaminoglycoside antibiotics (Jenne et al. 2001)h ad been previously shown to be able to inhibit the self-cleavage of hammerhead ribozymes in the in vitro setting, we first screened such compounds in the cell-based assay.W et hen extended the studies to include the high-throughput screening of 58,076compounds. We report here the results of those screening efforts and the characteristics (and in some cases,the mechanism of action) of the inhibitors that were identified."

All members of this group contain at least am odified 7-position on the purine (Fig. 2A). Analogst hat have modifications other than at the 7-position, such as 2-amino, 3-deaza, 6-chloro, 9-deaza, lacked an inhibitory effect. In addition, the identified compoundsa ll contain a2 9 OH group on the sugar base, indicating that ar ibose is necessary fort heir inhibitory effects (Fig. 2 A). Similar analogs that lack 2 9 OH or are missing the ribosee ntirely produced no appreciable inhibition (29 -deoxy-tubercidin, 2 9 -deoxy-toyocamycin) (Fig. 2B). Of all the compounds, toyocamycin (Aszalos et al. 1966) was found to be the most potent ribozyme inhibitor, resulting in up to 365-fold luc inductionw hen applied to the stable cell line.T he effectiveness of the remaining compounds in this group was <60-fold (Table 2). Based on its apparent higher effectiveness, ad ose-response curve of toyocamycin on the stable cell line wasg enerated. As shown in Figure 2C, the inductionp eakedr apidly around1m Ma nd then dropped off sharply. This drop coincidedwith apparent cell toxicity observed by microscopy. In addition, adecrease of luc expressionf romc ells carrying inactive ribozymes, presumably due to the toxicity effects of the compound, was observed when the concentration of toyocamycin reached 0.5 m M. The dose-limiting toxicity of toyocamycin thus excludes its use at higher concentration or for longterm applications. Thesecondgroup of ribozyme inhibitors identified in the screenc onsists of uridine analogs, including 5-bromouridine, 5-fluorouridine (FUR), and 5-fluorouracil (5FU)(Fig. 3A). All contain a5 -position modification on the pyrimidine. Analogst hat contain an iodo, am ethyl, ah ydroxyl, an ethyl, or an aza group on the 5-position lack an inhibitory effect. In the case of this group of inhibitors, FUR was the most potent. However, replacing the 2 9 OH group of FUR by either 2 9 deoxy or 2 9 O-methyl, or by inverting the stereocentero ft he 2 9 -position (Fig. 3 B), resulted in loss of inhibition, indicating that, as with adenosine analogs, ar ibose is necessary for the inhibitory effects of uridine analogs. In contrast to toyocamycin, the dose-response curve of FUR reached aplateau of 110-fold at 50 m M, and the plateau was maintained for aw ide range of concentrations (Fig. 3C), suggesting that an efficient induction can be reached with al ower dosage before reaching severe toxicity.T he related molecule 5FU (Longley et al. 2003), however, has ad oseresponse curve resembling that of toyocamycin, reaching ap eak of 65-fold followedb yaquick drop-off (Fig. 3D). The effectiveness of 5FU was also significantly less, requiring ac oncentration of 500 m Mt or each 50% of the maximal induction, as compared to the 6 m Mr equired for FUR( see EC50 in Table 2). For both FURa nd 5FU, a decrease of luc expressionf rom cells carryingi nactive ribozymes was observed when concentrations reached 800 m M.",
                        "The thirdg roup of ribozyme inhibitors belongs to the family of RNA-binding dyes, and includes Syto-83, ethidium bromide( homidium bromide), and acridineo range (Fig. 4 A). These dyes were also far less potent inhibitors than the adenosine or uridine analogs( Table 2).",
                        "As mentioned earlier, the N79 ribozyme used in our cellbased assay was developed from Sm1o f S. mansoni (Ferbeyre et al. 1998), ahuman parasite that infects people in many areas of the world (Ross et al. 2002). It is intriguing that oneo ft he drugss uggested in the past as potential treatments for Schistosome infection was tubercidin (Jaffe et al. 1971;e lK ouni 1991), the same molecule identified in our screen as an Sm1 ribozyme inhibitor. This prompted us to test other molecules with known anti-Schistosomal effects for their inhibitory potential. These included nebularine, dipyridamole, benzylacyclouridine, metrifonate, oxamniquine, praziquantel, and artemether. However, only nebularine (also an adenosine analog) (el Kouni and Cha 1987) showed an inhibitory effect on ribozyme selfcleavage, albeit minimal (Table 2). Interestingly, unlike most of the adenosine analogs found in ours creen, nebularine contains am odification on the 6-butn ot the 7-position of the purine base (Fig. 2A).",

                        "To examinethe mechanismsresponsible forribozymeinhibition, we incubatedthe N79 ribozyme with either tubercidin or toyocamycin in an in vitro catalytic reaction. Surprisingly, neither tubercidin (Fig. 5A, lanes3-8)nor toyocamycin (Fig. 5B, lanes3-8)was able to inhibitribozymeself-cleavage in vitro,a si ndicated by the unaltered cleavage percentage over ab road range of compound concentrations. The lack of direct inhibition by these molecules indicatedt hat their mechanism of inhibition was not likely due to direct ribozyme-compound interactions.I nl ight of our findings that inhibitory activity appeared to always be associated with a2 9 OH group on the sugar base, we next asked whether covalent incorporation of these analogs into the ribozyme-containing RNA might be required for the inhibition of RNA self-cleavage. To test if covalent incorporationo fi dentifiedi nhibitory molecules can, indeed, lead to cleavage inhibition, tubercidin-triphosphatewas used in place of ATP in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate ribozyme RNAc arrying substitutions in all adenosinep ositions. As shown in Figure 5C, this substitution resulted in the complete loss of ribozyme self-cleavage (Fig. 5C, lanes 2-6), while the unsubstituted ribozyme cleaved efficiently under the samec onditions (Fig. 5C, lane 7).",
                        "Similarly, FUR (Fig. 5D) and 5FU (Fig. 5E) exhibitedno inhibitory effect when incubateddirectlywithN79 ribozyme at concentrations that would normally produce pronounced induction in the cell-based assays. Oura ttempts to examinet he effect of incorporating FUR into the N79 ribozyme were inconclusive due to the difficulty of generating full-length FUR-substitutedN 79 ribozyme by T7 polymerase. However, past studies using chemical synthesis to generate FUR-containing hammerhead ribozymes demonstrated that when incorporated at certaink ey positions of the ribozyme,F UR,i ndeed, impaireds elf-cleavage (Hammann et al. 2001).  Consistent with the mechanism of covalent incorporation of the compounds into the ribozyme-encoding cellular mRNA, it has been reportedt hat tubercidin (Acs et al. 1964), toyocamycin (Suhadolnik et al. 1967), 5-FUridine (Glazerand Lloyd1982),and 5-FU (Glazerand Lloyd1982) areable to enterthe ribonucleotide pool for RNA synthesis and can be found in the cellular RNAs of mammalian cells. This mechanism of inhibition of ribozyme function, dependent on inhibitor incorporation into RNA, may shed light on the basis for our identification of only adenosine analogs with am odified 7-position and uridine analogs with am odified 5-position as effective inhibitors and our inability to identify any analogous guanosine and cytidine analogs. While these findings might simply relate to the variable cell permeability of different molecules, or their ability to be recognized by RNAp olymerases for incorporation, they may suggest that structural interactions involving the 7-and 5-positions of Aa nd Ub ases, respectively, arep articularly important for N79 ribozyme function in vivo. Althoughthe 7-position of Adoesnot form hydrogen bondsi nt he standard Watson-Crick base pairs, the X-ray structures of hammerhead ribozymes, indeed,s howedi ts involvementi nf orming the nonstandard A-G basep airs in thec onserved core (A9-G12, A13-G8; see Fig. 2f or the nucleotide numbering) (Fu and McLaughlin 1992;Pley et al. 1994;S cott et al. 1995). The role of the 5-position of Uisless clear since it is not involved in hydrogen bonds of either the standard Watson-Crick or the G-U wobble base pairs. Nevertheless, it was shown that incorporating FUR at the U4 and U7 of the hammerhead core led to the impairment of self-cleavage (Hammann et al. 2001). Thus, modifying those Aand Ubases in the conserved core could lead to the graded loss of cleavage activity in vivo. Furthermore, the N79 ribozyme contains an unusually high percentageo fAand Ub ases in its loops Ia nd II. Substituting these bases could disrupt the critical interaction of the two loops required for the ribozyme to function in cells (De la Pena et al. 2003;Khvorova et al. 2003;Penedoe ta l. 2004;Yen et al. 2004)."

To address this question, varying amounts of each compoundw ere combined anda dded to HEK79 cells, and subsequently, the fold induction of luc expression was determined.

                "The work describedh ere represents the first cell-based screen aimed at identifying small moleculesc apableo f modulating ribozyme self-cleavage in vivo. By screening 58,076 compounds, we were able to identify two small molecules, toyocamycin and FUR, that can potently inhibit ribozyme functioni nm ammalian cells. It is of significant interest that the two most potent inhibitors of ribozyme function in cells that we identified appear to inhibit ribozyme self-cleavage via their covalent incorporation into the mRNA carrying the ribozyme sequences, as evidenced by the inability of these molecules to inhibit ribozyme selfcleavage in vitro and by the loss of self-cleavage activity when these molecules are incorporated. Based on the welldescribed interactionsb etween specific aminoglycosides and other small molecules and RNA (Stage et al. 1995;Murray and Arnold 1996;Hermanna nd Westhof 1998;Tor et al.1998;Jenne et al. 2001), we had expected that our extensive screen of compounds would have led to the identificationo fc ompounds that inhibit ribozyme selfcleavage by virtue of their direct binding to ribozymecontaining RNA. Ourinability to identify such compounds may suggest that the complexs tructure of mRNA molecules and their associated proteins present in mammalian cells greatly restricts the possibilities for the types of interactions between small moleculesa nd RNAs that can lead to the inhibition of RNA self-cleavage. The ability of morpholino oligonucleotides and several RNA-binding dyes to inhibit ribozyme activity in cells, however, suggests that appropriate interactions between specific small molecules and ribozymes that lead to inhibition of self-cleavage in vivo arei ndeed possible. We are hopeful that additional screening efforts will lead to the identificationo fn ew inhibitors of ribozyme function with improved toxicity profiles and more desirablep harmacokinetic properties. We had already madeu se of one of the molecules identified in the current study, toyocamycin, to provide acritical ''proof of principle'' for the ability to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivovia the modulation of RNA self-cleavage (Yen et al. 2004). As expected by the proposed mode of action of this inhibitor, we showed in that study that in the absence of toyocamycin, the ribozyme-controlled mRNA was not detectable in the nucleus or cytoplasm in cells carrying active ribozymes, consistent with the mechanism that ribozyme self-cleavage leads to rapid degradation of mRNAs. However, when these cells were treated with toyocamycin, the amounto fl uc mRNA increased to al evel comparable to that of cells carrying inactive ribozyme, which is consistent with the mechanism that inhibition of ribozyme self-cleavage leads to the generation of intact mRNAincells (Yen et al. 2004). In the present studies, we show that the combined administration of toyocamycina nd FUR to cells harboring ar ibozyme-regulatable expressionc onstruct leads to an improved induction of gene expression, relative to the use of toyocamycin alone.T his combined regimen requires lower concentrationso ft he twoc ompounds than must be used to achieve reasonable levels of inductionsusing either compound alone, and consequently results in al ess toxic effect on the cells. While it is hopeful that the use of such at wo-compound cocktail may enable more experimental applications of the ribozyme-based gene regulation system than arepossible with toyocamycin alone, the identification   genome copies/mL), or recombinant AAV carrying the inactive N79/luc transgene (titer of 5 3 10 9 genome copies/mL) were injected into the left or the right ear, respectively. Three weeks later, as ingle pulse of roughly 5 m Lo f cocktail containing 20 m Mo ft oyocamycin and 12 mM of FUR was injected in each ear (day 0). Animals were imaged as previously described (Yen et al. 2004) to determine the levels of luc expression prior to the addition of compounds, and 2dafter compound treatment. The figure shows ar epresentative animal of the threeanimal cohort. The induction in fold described in text was calculated based on the photon output in the left ear before and after cocktail treatment, and was normalized to the photon output from the right ear.",

                "In addition to the use of the ribozyme-based gene regulation system forthe controlofexpressionofgeneproducts, the finding that one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents,5 FU, can serve as ar ibozyme inhibitor in vivo raises the interesting possibility that one novela pplication of RNA-only gene regulations ystems might relate to the real-time ''sensing'' of the presence of specific compounds in vivo. In the specific case of 5FU, the abilityofthe molecule to induce expression of areporter genecould provide an important means of monitoring 5FU uptakeand retention by tumors and normal tissues, and/or facilitate efforts to developm ore optimalr outes of 5FU administration."

On the same day, cells were treated with compounds at afinal concentration of 4 m g/mL and 0.1% DMSO, followed by an incubation period of 48 hat37 \u00b0Cinahumidified incubator containing 5% CO 2 .Cells were then lysed, and luciferin was added to the cells at af inal concentration of 4 m g/mL; the amount of light output from each well was recorded on aPacker Fusion platereader. Induction of luc expression by ap articular compound was calculated by subtracting the signal with instrument background and background from untreated cells. All screens were performed in triplicate repeats."

                        "DNA templates containing aT 7p romoter and the ribozyme sequences were generated by PCR. 33 P-labeled RNA was then transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 50 m M blocking anti-sense oligonucleotides using Ambion's MEGAshortscript kit. The anti-sense oligonucleotide sequence used was 5 9 -GATAGCAGTGGAATCCAGGACGCAC-39 .I nt he absence of the anti-sense oligonucleotide, z 95% of the transcripts were cleaved during the 3-h in vitro transcription reactions. In the presence of the anti-sense oligonucleotide, the percentage of cleavage products dropped to 35%. To make ribozymes with incorporated tubercidin, transcription was carried out by substituting ATP with tubercidin triphosphate. Full-length RNAs were then purified by 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To determine the cleavage efficiency, ribozyme was incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 3m in at 95\u00b0Ca nd slowly cooled to 23\u00b0Ci n1 5m in. Selfcleavage reactions in the presence or the absence of inhibitory compounds were triggered by adding MgCl 2 to 1m Mo r1 0m M at 23\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5v olumes of stop solution (8 Mu rea, 50% formamide, 40 mM EDTA), and the cleaved fragments were separated by a1 0% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cleavage percentage was then quantified by PhosphorImager. We did not detect any cleavage products in transcription reactions when tubercidin triphosphate was used to replace ATP."
