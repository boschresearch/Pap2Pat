                        "Snapshot spectral imagers are known. Such imagers perform simultaneous (instantaneous) acquisition of spatial and spectral data in a single snapshot. The data acquired forms a \u201cspectral cube\u201d (also referred to as \u201cdata cube\u201d) of a source object (also referred to simply as \u201cobject\u201d or \u201cscene\u201d). A spectral cube includes light intensity data in two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension and is expressed as a three-dimensional (3D) matrix. An advanced SSI system based on a regular digital camera and a 1D disperser inserted in the optical path between an imaged object and the camera sensor chip is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,081,244, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Some embodiments disclosed therein further include a blurring element. U.S. Pat. No. 8,081,244 also provides additional background information.",
                        "Known snapshot SI designs are based exclusively on computed tomography spectral imaging (CTIS) designs, which use one of two disperser types: a rotating disperser (prism or grating), or a two-dimensional (2D) grating disperser (e.g. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,522,403 and 7,092,088). Disadvantages of CTIS imagers include complicated and expensive optical setups with high quality relay optics, some requiring moving parts, the need to process and output huge spectral cubes, an inherent \u201cmissing cone\u201d problem in data processing, a lack of miniaturization leading to relatively large sizes, and high cost.",
                        "Compressed sensing (CS) based spectral imaging is also known. One CS-SI approach uses a single pixel camera which incorporates a digital micro-mirror array (DMD) driven by pseudo random patterns and a single spectrometer (C. Li et al., IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 21(3), pp. 1200-1210, 2012). Other approaches employ variants of \u201ccoded aperture snapshot spectral imaging\u201d (CASSI). CASSI uses modulation of an image with a coded aperture and dispersive elements. CASSI variants include a single-shot compressive spectral imager having a dual-disperser architecture (DD CASSI), or a single disperser design (SD CASSI). A more recent approach, referred to as random convolution snapshot spectral imaging (RCSSI), is based on focal plane array measurements of spectrally dispersed coherent sources that have been randomly convoluted by two spatial light modulators. RCSSI requires coherent illumination, which restricts the imaging system considerably.",
                        "The known solutions to the problem of acquiring a full spectral cube in a snapshot involve much more complex and expensive hardware that that of a regular digital camera. Moreover, these solutions cannot be miniaturized. There is a therefore a need for, and it would be advantageous to have snapshot spectral imagers based on digital cameras, without any (or with just minimal) hardware changes to the cameras. It would be further advantageous to have such imagers miniaturized."

                        "The description next provides details of methods for SSI using essentially a digital camera and a RIP diffuser and various apparatus embodiments. Due to the optical properties of the RIP diffuser (see below), each pixel in a dispersed image obtained with such apparatus includes a linear mixture of spectral and spatial information from all pixels of a corresponding column in the dispersed image. For the reconstruction of the full spectral cube, each pixel of the dispersed image can be thought of as a linear equation with ML variables. Since there are MN equations and a total of MNL variables, this problem seems underdetermined. However, CS theory suggests a method to capture and represent compressible images at a rate significantly below the Nyquist rate, by exploiting the sparse nature of the image data in some mathematical basis. This may be done using non-adaptive linear projections which enable full reconstruction of the spectral cube of the source object. The full reconstruction is done using an optimization process to compensate for the underdetermined nature of the problem. The operator performing the linear projections can be described as a \u201csensing matrix\u201d that has fewer rows than columns and that operates on the spectral cube to form a dispersed image. The dispersed image has fewer elements than the original source object and is formed from a smaller number of equations than the total number of variables (voxels) in the spectral cube. The spectral cube can be reconstructed, with some accuracy, from the dispersed image by an iterative digital processing algorithm.",
                        "The reconstruction process guarantees full reconstruction of the source object if the sensing matrix satisfies a RIP condition. The RIP condition is expressed in Eq. (21) below. A RIP diffuser is designed so that the transfer function of the optical imaging system (which is identical with the sensing matrix) including the diffuser satisfies the RIP condition at each single wavelength (or at a band chosen around the single wavelength). Put differently, a RIP diffuser is a diffuser which obeys a mathematical RIP condition with a block-sensing matrix of the optical system, wherein each block of the block-sensing matrix corresponds to a single wavelength (or a band chosen around the single wavelength) in a spectral range of interest. In some embodiments, the block-sensing matrix may be of Toeplitz type. In particular, the RIP diffuser modifies a point spread function (PSF) of an imaging optical system at each wavelength, such that the resulting linear transform of the source object to a dispersed image satisfies the RIP condition, as required in compressed sensing based reconstruction, The RIP diffuser may be an optical element with a 1D or 2D random phase transmission function, amplitude transmission function or a combination thereof.",
                        "Due to the compressibility property of the source object, this object can be represented in a space in which it is sparse. The sparse representation of the source object can be reconstructed from the dispersed image by performing minimization with respect to a L1 difference criterion between a reconstructed sparse vector of the source object multiplied by the sensing matrix and the dispersed image. The L1 minimization process (with the constraint) can be exemplarily achieved via a linearized Bregman iteration process, see e.g. W. Yin et al., SIAM J. Imaging Sciences (hereinafter \u201cLB\u201d). Vol. 1(1), pp. 143-168, 2008, or via a split Bregman iteration process, see e.g. Z. Cai et al., SIAM J. Multiscale Modeling and Simulation, Vol. 8(2), pp. 337-369, 2009 (hereinafter \u201cSB\u201d). Both processes have been known to be efficient tools for CS reconstruction. The Bregman iteration (linearized or split) is an iterative algorithm which involves a closed loop, with the reconstruction constrained L1 error serving as the feedback to the loop, and with a shrinking operation that ensures a sparse reconstruction.",
                        "FIG. 1A shows schematically an embodiment of a method for SSI disclosed herein. In step 102, a dispersed image is obtained with an optical imaging system that includes a digital camera having an imaging lens and a pixelated image sensor, and a 1D or 2D RIP diffuser inserted in the optical path between an object and the image sensor. Optionally, the imaging system may also include a fixed 1D disperser as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,081,244. The RIP diffuser (and optionally the disperser) may be installed between the imaging lens and the scene, between the imaging lens and the camera sensor, or as a part of (inside) the imaging lens. After determination of the block sensing matrix corresponding to the RIP diffuser formulation above, a dispersed image at the camera sensor can be linearly related to the voxels of the spectral cube. Specifically, for a 1D RIP diffuser, each column of the dispersed image is a linear combination of all spectral and spatial data in the corresponding source object column. In step 104, the sensing matrix is used to perform a Bregman iteration process which is sequentially applied to columns of the dispersed image separately, to reconstruct spectral cube information corresponding to M voxels in each of N columns and L spectral bands of the source object cube. Details are given in FIG. 1B. The result of step 104 is a set of vectors, each vector including all spectral information for every pixel in the corresponding image column. In step 106, the results from all reconstructed image columns from step 104 are placed next to each other, thereby providing the entire spectral information for every pixel in the dispersed image. The result of step 106 is the reconstruction of a matrix X\u2032 defined in Eq. (1) below and which represents the full spectral cube. Finally, in step 108, the spectral cube is processed to obtain L separate spectral images of the object, i.e. each consecutive set of M rows in X\u2032 is taken to form the spectral image of that set's corresponding spectral band.",
                        "FIG. 1B shows details of step 104. It describes the process that each column j, which is taken from the sensor that contains the snapshot image, goes through. In step 120, the measurement (sensing) matrix A is multiplied by either a wavelet matrix or a framelet matrix \u03a8 to sparsify the sensing matrix. This yields a new sensing matrix \u0398. A linearized or split Bregman iteration using column j of the snapshot image (represented by a vector y) and \u0398 is performed in step 122 to approximate a vector \u015d. In step 124, \u015d is then transformed by \u03a8 to obtain x, a vector which includes all spectral information in each pixel of the column.",
                        "FIG. 1C shows details of step 122 for a linearized Bregman iteration as described in LB. Vectors \u015d and v are initialized in step 130. An approximation error between \u0398\u015d and y is found, and this approximation error is transformed by \u0398T and added to v (an auxiliary vector used in the Bregman iterations) in step 132. Each element of v is then compared to a threshold to obtain a more sparse vector \u015d in step 134.",
                        "FIG. 1D shows detail of step 122 for a split Bregman iteration as described in SB. Vectors u, d and b are initialized in step 140. To sparsify the source object data, a framelet transform, wavelet transform, a combination thereof, or K-SVD is applied to d-b in step 142. Appropriate framelet transforms may be found in A. Averbuch, P. Neittaanmaki and V. Zheludev, \u201cPeriodic discrete-time frames: Design and application for image processing\u201d, submitted to the SIAM J. on Imaging Sciences, 2012, and in A. Averbuch, P. Neittaanmaki and V. Zheludev, \u201cSpline-based frames in the space of periodic signals\u201d, submitted to Inverse Problems and Imaging, 2012. A linear equation is then solved to find a new value for vector u in step 144. An inverse framelet transform F\u22121{u} of u is calculated in step 146. Each element of F\u22121u+bv is compared to a threshold to obtain a new value for vector d in step 148. A new value for b is then calculated as bnew=b+(F\u22121u\u2212d) in step 150."

                                "FIG. 2A shows schematically an embodiment 200 of a snapshot spectral imager disclosed herein. Imager 200 includes a digital camera 202 and a RIP diffuser 204. The digital camera may be any known camera, for example a SLR camera, a video camera, a cell-phone camera or a miniaturized camera of the type used in gastroscopy or endoscopy. In an embodiment, the RIP diffuser may be one-dimensional (1D), see design below. In the embodiment shown, the RIP diffuser is inserted in an optical path between a source object 201 and an image sensor 206. For simplicity, all source objects in the following embodiments are marked with, and referred to by the same number, 201. Imager 200 further includes an imaging lens 208, a system aperture diaphragm 210, and, optionally, a 1D (or 2D) disperser 212 and a band-pass spectral filter 214. The image sensor provides a dispersed image 216. The RIP diffuser, (and optionally the disperser), may be positioned at the plane of the system aperture diaphragm. Such positioning allows the diffuser to function in an essentially plane light-wave mode, which minimizes inherent aberrations and improves image quality. In an embodiment, the RIP diffuser may be part of a lens block and placed inside the camera. In another embodiment, the RIP diffuser may be placed outside the digital camera, between the camera lens and the object. In yet another embodiment, the RIP diffuser may be placed inside the digital camera lens, between the lens and the image sensor. The design of the component lenses may be matched with the light dispersing properties of the diffuser (and, if present, of the disperser). The processing of the dispersed image and other information is performed by a processor 220, which may be integrated in the digital camera or may be external to the camera. A processor exists in all apparatus embodiments in FIGS. 2b and 3-7, but is not shown for simplicity. Since miniaturized digital cameras are known and since the RIP diffuser may be made in the form of a thin diffusive-diffractive optical element, an imager such as imager 200 can clearly be miniaturized, for example for use in a diagnostic pill.",

In other embodiments, there may be more than two apertures. In general, an apparatus disclosed herein may also use designs with two optical paths leading to a single image sensor, see e.g. US patent application No. 2007/0285554.

Alternatively the light is spectrally dispersed by the diffractive disperser One of the two split beams passes through the RIP diffuser and is imaged by the 2nd posterior block (or alternatively by the common posterior block) of the imaging lens to the dispersed image sensor (or to the double sensor), thereby providing a dispersed image on the dispersed image sensor. The other beam is imaged by the 1st posterior block (or alternatively by the common posterior block) of the imaging lens to the regular image sensor (or to the double sensor), thereby providing a regular image. The optional band-pass filter may be used in some embodiments to filter unwanted sections of the spectrum.
