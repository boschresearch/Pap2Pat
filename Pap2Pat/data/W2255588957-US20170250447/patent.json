                        "Due to the recent spread of portable (including wearable) electronic devices with compact designs, batteries for supplying electric power to those devices are required to be thinner, more flexible, and more stretchable. Energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to sustain large strains (much greater than 1%) under complex deformations (for instance, bending, tension/compression, and torsion) are indispensable components for flexible, stretchable electronics. Recently, wearable electronics, such as flexible displays, stretchable circuits, hemispherical electronic eyes, and epidermal electronics have emerged. Various approaches have been employed to achieve flexible and stretchable energy storage devices, such as thin film based bendable supercapacitors and batteries, buckling-based stretchable supercapacitors, and island-serpentine-based stretchable LIBs. Recently, an origami-based approach was adopted to develop highly deformable LIBs, where standard LIBs were produced followed by designated origami folding. The folding endows the origami LIB with a high level of deformability by changing the LIB from a planar state to a folded state. In this way, the LIBs are capable of being incorporated into portable and wearable electronic devices.",
                        "However, previously developed origami-based flexible and stretchable devices have two disadvantages. First, their stretchability is limited from the folded state to the planar state. Although it can be tuned by different folding patterns, the constraint is still prescribed by the planar state. As such, their deformability is limited and, as such, their use is limited. Second, the folded state involves uneven surfaces, which may introduce inconvenience when integrating with functional devices.",
                        "Therefore, there remains a need for a flexible and stretchable battery that is stretchable beyond its planar state while still remaining functional. Further, flexible and stretchable batteries that can be integrated within portable and wearable electronic devices are desired."

                        "The present invention provides flexible and stretchable batteries by combining folding and cutting to define patterns that form an even (or close to even) surface after stretching, whereby the stretchability is not limited by the planar state of the battery. The art of folding and cutting to form various shapes is known as kirigami. The principle of the invention is to utilize rotation and/or bending of the interconnection and structure to release the stress during stretching and twisting the system to produce stretchability. One way to produce such a battery is by folding the flat sheet battery, and then cutting the battery so that when the battery is unfolded it is able to stretch beyond its planar state. Alternative ways may include the process sequences of a combination of zero or multiple times of cutting, folding and unfolding following designed patterns. Any cutting patterns that allow for stretching of the battery beyond its flat planar dimension are appropriate. In this application, the word \u201cstretch\u201d includes deformation formats of stretching and contracting, and the word \u201cstretchability\u201d includes deformation capability of stretching and contracting.",
                        "Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a flexible and stretchable battery that contains a cutting pattern that enables the battery to stretch beyond its planar state in all dimensions. The flexible and stretchable battery includes an assembly having an anode side and a cathode side separated by a separator and sealed in a packaging. The assembly is in a folded configuration and contains at least one cut therein, such that when the assembly is unfolded, it is able to stretch beyond its flat planar state in all dimensions.",

The method involves forming an assembly having an anode side and a cathode side separated by a separator and sealed in a packaging. The assembly is folded and cut, such that when the assembly is unfolded, it is able to stretch beyond its flat planar state in all dimensions.",
                        "Alternatively, some methods involve providing a battery in a flat planar form, processing the battery with the sequence of combination of zero or multiple times of cutting, folding and unfolding following designed patterns to allow the battery to be stretched beyond its planar state in all dimensions. According to one aspect, the battery is folded into a corrugated pattern before cutting. The cutting is such that it produces a cutting pattern on the battery. The cutting is based on the art of kirigami which starts with a folded base which is then cut. The cuts are then opened and flattened to make the finished kirigami which contains symmetrical and repeated cutting patterns.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Five kirigami patterns are utilized, as illustrated in FIGS. 1(a)-(e), with (a) a zigzag-cut pattern, (b) a cut-N-twist pattern, (c) a cut-N-shear pattern; (d) a cut-N-rotate pattern; and (e) a spiral cut pattern. The first three patterns are the focus of the invention.",
                        "The zigzag-cut pattern (FIG. 1(a)) represents one of the most commonly seen kirigami patterns and is produced by cutting a folded stack of foil asymmetrically between the neighboring creases, which defines zigzag-like cuttings in the longitudinal direction. The zigzag pattern can be stretched beyond its length in the planar state, which is the desired advantage of kirigami. To accommodate stretching, the out-of-plane deformation (or equivalently, buckling) occurs at the vicinity of cuts. The level of stretchability depends on the length of the cut and is a function of buckling amplitude.",
                        "To eliminate the out-of-plane deformation, the cut-N-twist pattern (FIG. 1(b)) is utilized, in which a folded stack of foil is symmetrically cut at all creases, and then unfolded to a planar state, followed by twisting at the two ends. The twisted structure is shown in the bottom panel of FIG. 1(b) and is analogous to a twisted telephone cord. This pattern represents a locked structure in a sense that the out-of-plane deformation, induced by stretching, is constrained, and rotation and bending occurs at the cuts to accommodate stretching. The packing density of a cut-N-twist pattern is defined by the width of each face. Electrochemical and mechanical characterization results for LIB s using a cut-N-twist pattern show that the stretchability of a kirigami LIB is over 100% as compared to its most compact state. It should be noted that there is no significant change in the thickness (h) of this LIB between its most compact state (h=1.31 mm) and its most stretched state (h=1.07 mm).",
                        "To increase the packing density, the cut-N-shear pattern (FIG. 1(c)) is introduced, where folding is employed after symmetric cutting and then the folded structure is subjected to shear to form the cut-N-shear pattern as shown in FIG. 1(c). Thus, the packing density doubles compared with that for the cut-N-twist pattern. The stretching is also realized by the rotations and bending of the cuts and no out-of-plane deformation is involved.",
                        "Kirigami LIBs, specifically the LIBs using cut-N-twist, cut-N-shear, zigzag-cut patterns illustrated in FIGS. 1(a)-(c), are demonstrated. Conventional materials and approaches for LIB preparation were used, specifically utilizing graphite (available commercially from Fisher Scientific Inc.) and LiCoO2 (LCO, available commercially from MTI Corp.) as anode and cathode active materials, respectively. Conventional slurries of these active materials were prepared and used to coat the current collectors, where copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) served as the anode and cathode current collectors, respectively. The battery cells were assembled by following designated folding and cutting based on the kirigami patterns of FIGS. 1(a)-(c) in an argon-filled glovebox using polypropylene (available commercially as Celgard 2500), 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC:DEC(1:1:1) (available commercially from MTI Corp.), and aluminized polyethylene (PE) (available commercially from Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) as separator, electrolyte, and packaging materials, respectively. Extra care was taken to ensure no short circuits or leakage at the cuts during assembly.",
                        "FIG. 2(a) is a graph illustrating the electrochemical cycling results of the kirigami LIB disclosed in FIG. 1(b) (a cut-N-twist pattern) at its most compact state (for the 1st to 5th cycles), followed by that at its most stretched state (for the 6th to 10th cycles), then that at its most compact state again (for the 11th to 15th cycles), and then that at its most stretched state again (for the 16th to 20th cycles) under the current density of 50 mA g\u22121. Well-defined plateaus at around 3.7V are observed along with fairly stable charge/discharge behaviors under compact and stretched states. The present mass loading gives this kirigami LIB about 35 mAh energy capacity. The mass loading of LiCoO2 (LCO) (specific capacity of 145 mAh g\u22121) and graphite (specific capacity of 372 mAh g\u22121) were 0.12 g and 0.28 g, respectively, which gave the LIB the capacity of 35 mAh.",
                        "FIG. 2(b) is a graph illustrating the capacity and Coulombic efficiency as a function of the cycle number of a kirigami LIB prepared using a cut-N-twist pattern for a current density of 50 mAg\u22121. It shows the reasonable cyclic stability of the LIBs up to 20 cycles. It should be emphasized that this result represents the stability of this kirigami LIB at mixed states, i.e., both compact and stretched states. Another important point is that the energy density (in the unit of Wh/kg) in FIG. 2(d) is calculated using all materials in this LIB, including active materials, current collectors, electrolyte, and packaging. This energy density is comparable to the present commercially available LIBs. The mass accounts for all the materials involved in a cell, which is 1.49 g.",
                        "FIG. 2c shows the rate performance of a kirigami LIB prepared using a cut-N-twist pattern when the charge/discharge rate varied in the sequence of C/3, C/2, C and C/3 again at both compact and stretched state. When discharge rates increase, as expected, the capacity decreases from 29.3 mAh for C/3 rate to 26.5 mAh for C/2 rate, and 21.4 mAh for discharge rate C. However, the capacity recovered to the 27.6 mAh when the discharge rate resumed to C/3 after 30 cycles charge/discharge at the both compact the stretched state under varies C-rates, which indicates good rate performance of this kirigami LIB.",
                        "FIG. 2(d) provides the results for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies during the first discharge cycle at the most compact state before stretching and stretched state after 100 cycles of mechanical stretching for a kirigami LIB prepared using a cut-N-twist pattern. EIS studies were performed by applying a small perturbation voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. Typical impedance spectrum, with high-to-middle frequency range flat curve and a relative straight line representing the low frequency range, was observed. No obvious semicircle was observed because of the low internal resistance. There are no significant changes in the impedance before and after mechanical deformation.",
                        "The mechanical characteristics of the fully charged kirigami LIB using the cut-N-twist pattern of FIG. 1(b) are then examined. At different stretchability levels, namely, 0%, 40%, and 90%, the output voltage remained steady at 3.8 V. FIG. 2(e) shows the maximum output power of the kirigami LIB as a function of stretchability, \u03b5stretch, under different cycles of stretching. Here, the internal resistance of the battery was measured to be about 1.8 \u03a9. Over 1,000 stretching cycles and a stretchability \u03b5stretch of up to 90%, it is found that the output power is quite stable and shows no noticeable decay. The output power of 4.1 W is sufficient to operate commercial light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs driven by a kirigami LIB formed using a cut-N-twist pattern do not show noticeable dimming upon cyclic stretching, from 0% (its most compact state) to 30% stretching to 70% stretching.",
                        "FIGS. 2(f)-(g) show scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) for the anode current collectors (e.g., copper foil) at the cuts before charging, and after discharge and 100 cycles of mechanical deformation for the cut-N-twist pattern of FIG. 1(b). Similar SEM images are given for the cathode current collectors (e.g., aluminum foils), as shown in FIGS. 2(h) and 2(i). There appear to be no cracks after cyclic mechanical stretching, which contributes to the robust electrochemical and mechanical characterizations.",
                        "This phenomenon is consistent with the theoretical analysis and a simplified model as shown in FIG. 3(a), where two pre-existing cracks are presumably caused by initial folding and/or cutting, and are located at the present positions when a pair of concentrated moment M is applied at the end of the strip with length L and width H. The concentrated moment M is utilized to characterize the applied stretching deformation that causes bending about the folding creases. Angle \u03b8 is used to denote the relative positions of two strips with \u03b8=0 for the initially folded position. When the moment M is applied, there exist two modes of deformation. The first mode causes the growth of the pre-existing cracks from a to \u03b1+\u0394\u03b1, while maintaining the angle \u03b8 unchanged, which refers to \u201ccrack growth\u201d. The second mode leads to plastic deformation of the thin foil at the vicinity of the fold by altering \u03b8 to \u03b8+\u0394\u03b8, which refers to \u201cplastic rolling\u201d.",
                        "The critical condition for \u201ccrack growth\u201d is given by the Griffith's criterion. The driving force, or the release of the elastic energy due to the propagation of cracks, A\u03c32\u03b1/E equates to the resistance of the crack growth, defined by 2 \u03b3. Here A is a non-dimensional geometrical factor that depends on angle \u03b8, i.e., A=A(\u03b8); \u03c3 is the normal traction applied on the crack surface and related to the moment M by \u03c3=6M/H2; E is the elastic modulus; and \u03b3 [unit: Newton/meter] is the surface energy. Thus the critical moment for \u201ccrack growth\u201d is given by Mcrcrack growth=H2\u221a{square root over (E\u03b3/(2A\u03b1))}/3. For \u201cplastic rolling\u201d, the rate of energy dissipation due to the plastic deformation during the rolling about the creases provides the resistance, given by \u03b2H2(1+tan2\u03b8)/4; and the driving force is the rate of release of potential energy due to the increase of \u03b8, given by M/2. Here \u03b2 [unit: Newton/meter2] is the dissipated energy per unit area due to plastic rolling, which is related to the extent of the plastic deformation (i.e., hard crease versus soft crease) and can be associated with the yield stress of plastic materials. The critical condition for \u201cplastic rolling\u201d is given by Mcrplastic rolling=\u03b2H2(1+tan2 \u03b8)/2. When M is applied, the smaller one between Mcrcrack growth and Mcrplastic rolling is activated as the critical moment during deformation, which leads to either \u201ccrack growth\u201d mode, when Mcrcrack growth<Mcrplastic rolling, or \u201cplastic rolling\u201d mode, when Mcrplastic rolling<Mcrcrack growth.",
                        "Finite element simulations were conducted using the commercially available package ABAQUS to analyze these two deformation modes. Because in an LIB, Al foil tends to crack due to its low fracture toughness, the material parameters of Al were used in the analysis, with the surface energy \u03b3 0.868 N/m, elastic modulus E 69 GPa, and Poisson's ratio v 0.33. The geometry is H=3 mm, and L=10 mm to match with the experiments. The pre-existing crack is assumed small as compared with the width H. \u03b2, dissipated plastic energy per area, is calculated by folding a 10 \u03bcm-thick Al foil (the same thickness as that used in LIB) with different folding radius via finite element simulations.",
                        "FIG. 3(b) illustrates the \u201csafe zone\u201d (i.e., Mcrcrack growth/Mcrplastic rolling>1)and the \u201cfracture zone\u201d (i.e., Mcrcrack growth/Mcrplastic rolling<1) as a function of 0 for various \u03b1 and \u03b2. For example, \u03b1=0.03 mm (i.e., 1% of H, the width of strip) and \u03b2=20 MPa, corresponds to making a sharp crease of a 10 \u03bcm-thick Al foil with bending diameter of 70 \u03bcm (see FIG. 13), \u201csafe mode\u201d is activated for all angles of \u03b8. The results also show that for a larger \u03b2 (or equivalently shaper crease) or a (i.e., larger initial crack), \u201cfracture mode\u201d tends to occur. It is important to note from FIG. 12 that for the present battery setup (i.e., bending diameter ranging from 500 \u03bcm to 800 \u03bcm), \u03b2 is on the order of 1 MPa, which indicates that it is always the scenario to activate the \u201csafe mode\u201d. Thus, this analysis verifies that the robust electrochemical and mechanical performance of the kirigami LIB is due to the activated \u201csafe mode\u201d.",
                        "The stretchable kirigami LIBs disclosed herein are able to power an electronic device, e.g., a Samsung Gear 2 smart watch. The original LIB with an energy capacity of 300 mAh was removed from the Samsung Gear 2 device and a kirigami LIB using cut-N-twist pattern as disclosed herein was connected to the device. The mass loading for active materials are 0.26 g for graphite, 0.65 g for LCO, which gives the energy capacity 80 mAh. At the compact state, the kirigami LIB is 51.3 mm in length, 27 mm in width, and 2.6 mm in thickness. The produced kirigami LIB was sewn between two elastic bands at its two ends and wrapped around the wrist, allowing the elastic bands to function as an elastic watch strap. By sewing the kirigami LIB to the elastic band at the two ends, the LIB can be stretched and contracted, driven by the elasticity of the band. When the elastic band and the kirigami LIB were at their most compact states, the Samsung Gear 2 was just turned on (at the wrist of the user). Then, while the elastic band was stretched from the wrist to the upper arm, the Samsung Gear 2 was working normally. It is estimated from the circumferences of the wrist and upper arm, the kirigami LIB was subjected to a strain of 30%, lower than its full stretchability. While the elbow was bent and straightened, the smart watch was able to maintain normal functionality, and even display a video. During bending and straightening of the elbow, the biceps introduced an additional 15% strain to the kirigami LIB. Finally, the kirigami LIB was removed from the elastic bands and stretched directly while powering the smart watch. This experiment demonstrates the promises of using a kirigami LIB to replace present rigid and bulky batteries and to power a commercial smart watch, which has been a bottle-neck to develop compact wearable devices. It is worth mentioning that if the kirigami LIB is scaled up to cover the entire area of the elastic band (25 cm in length, 3 cm in width), the energy capacity is about 700 mAh, which significantly exceeds the current LIB used in most smart watches by using the space of the watch strap instead of using the limited space of watch body, and may disruptively impact the field of wearable electronics by offering extra physical and functionality design space. For a fully charged kirigami battery with 80 mAh capacity that was connected with a Samsung Gear 2 smart watch, the standby time was measured to be 24.5 hours. When the smart watch was paired with a Samsung Galaxy S5 cell phone with a Bluetooth connection when they were separated by 30 cm, the smart watch was able to make calls through the Bluetooth connection. The calling time was measured to be 90 minutes. To simulate the standby and calling tests, quantitative discharge characterizations were also conducted by applying the corresponding constant discharge currents for standby (2.9 mA) and calling (48 mA) using an Arbin electrochemical workstation. The stopping voltage of the smart watch was measured to be 3.6 V. As shown in FIG. 4(a) for the simulated standby test, the calling time (when the voltage drops to the stopping voltage 3.6 V) is 25.8 hours, which is consistent with the direct test. For the simulated calling test (FIG. 4(b)), the calling time is 90 minutes, which perfectly matches the direct test.",
                        "The demonstration of stretchable kirigami LIBs as set forth above only represents one application of this type of stretchable energy sources that fully utilize the mainstream manufacturing capability. Other applications may include smart bracelets and smart headbands among many others. It is expected that the kirigami LIBs are able to resolve one of the bottlenecks on the development of wearable devices by providing a scalable solution for a stretchable energy source. The competing mechanisms between \u201ccrack growth\u201d and \u201cplastic rolling\u201d also provide a much broader spectrum of employing the concept of kirigami to other fields, such as in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) where robust interconnects can be placed at the cut/fold locations and the functional devices are fabricated on the rigid faces, which leads to stretchable devices using standardized procedures. These areas appear promising for further research.",
                        "FIG. 5 outlines the assembly of the battery of the present invention. First, the battery is designed with a specific cut pattern. The separator, anode side, and cathode side of the battery are prepared separately according to the specific cut patterns. Those components are then assembled and sealed inside the packaging material. The battery is then folded and cut to the designed pattern.

                                "According to the Griffith's criterion for linear elastic fracture, potential energy takes this form \u03c0crack growth\u02dc\u03c32\u03b12/E, where \u03c3 is the normal stress on the crack, \u03b1 is the size of the crack and E is the elastic modulus. The energy releasing rate due to the crack growth is then given by J=\u2202\u03c0crack growth/\u2202\u03b1\u02dc\u03c32\u03b1/E. Here J is the J-integral which equals to the energy release per unit area. For the present scenario that has different geometrical setup as that in the Griffith's criterion, the geometry factors are taken into account. The form of J is speculated to be A\u03c32\u03b1/E, where A characterizes the geometrical effects and is determined by finite element simulations. A is assumed to be a function of \u03b8.",
                                "In finite element simulations using commercial package ABAQUS, the values of \u03c3, \u03b1 and E are fixed while \u03b8 changes from 0 to \u03c0/3. Plane stress model was applied as the structure has very low thickness compared to its in-plane dimensions. Mesh was refined around the crack tip, which is shown in FIG. 9 for \u03b8=\u03c0/4. About 200,000 CPS4R (4-node bilinear plane stress quadrilateral, reduced integration) elements were used to obtain accurate and converged results. J-integral was obtained by numerical integration along the elements on a circle with the crack tip as its center. After obtaining the values of J-integral for different angles \u03b8, the value of A can be calculated by the expression of J as mentioned above, i.e. J=A\u03c32\u03b1/E . Substitute A into the expression of Mcrcrack growth and the final expression of Mcrcrack growth is thus obtained.",

The area of the plastic zone is H2 tan\u03b8/4, so the critical moment Mcrplastic rolling for plastic rolling can be obtained by Mcrplastic rolling=\u2202\u03c0plastic rolling/\u2202\u03b8=\u2202(\u03b2H2 tan \u03b8/4)/\u2202\u03b8=\u03b2H2(1+tan2 \u03b8)/2.",

This problem was modeled by bending a thin film around a rigid circular die as illustrated in FIG. 11. The diameter of the rigid circular die corresponds to the folding thickness. The material parameters of Al were used in the analysis. Contact was defined between the deformable thin foil and the rigid die. 1,571 B22 (3-node quadratic beam) elements were used in the analysis. Once the thin foil enters the plastic zone, the plastic energy density was then calculated.",
                                "FIG. 12 shows \u03b2 as a function of the ratio between the folding thickness and foil thickness Hfolding/hfoil. It is found that as the ratio Hfolding/hfoil increases, \u03b2 decreases. For the real battery setup, Al foil is 10 \u03bcm in thickness, while the entire battery cell is 500 \u03bcm-800 \u03bcm in thickness depending on the mass loading of the active materials, which gives the ratio Hfolding/hfoil about 50 to 80.
