                        "Middle to heavy distillates from petroleum refineries contain hydrocarbon feedstock for diesels (C12-20) and lubricant base oils (C18-50). For applications in automobiles and machineries, the feedstock can be processed in order to improve its cold flow performance (e.g., low pour point and high viscosity index), stability (e.g., oxidation resistance and thermal stability), and, in the case of diesels, combustion quality (e.g., cetane number). This can be achieved by hydrotreating and hydrocracking, which can break down large molecules to branched, smaller alkanes, and remove impurities including sulfur, nitrogen, and metals, as well as the most reactive hydrocarbons such as aromatics and other unsaturated species. However, these hydroprocessing steps have little effect on linear alkanes that contribute to high pour points and low viscosity indices, and these linear alkanes then generally must be removed or converted in subsequent steps.",
                        "Linear alkanes were traditionally removed by solvent dewaxing, and later by catalytic cracking dewaxing. Both techniques can reduce the content of waxy alkanes, but at the same time can also lower the product value because of the reduced yield and less valuable cracked species. Dewaxing by solvent or catalytic cracking can be unacceptable for feedstock comprising essentially all linear alkanes, such as paraffinic feedstock derived from the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.",
                        "Crude oil remains the dominant source for transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks. Improving the efficiency of oil refining has the potential to help extend the supply and reduce the cost of current petroleum products. In the 1950s, crystalline zeolites containing sub-2 nm internal pores emerged as shape/size selective sorbents and catalysts, leading to dramatic improvements in numerous processes utilized by the petrochemical industry. For example, zeolites are used to catalyze the conversion of linear long-chain alkanes to slightly branched alkanes of similar molecular weight, with the goal of reducing the pour point and increasing the viscosity index of lubricant oils. Similar transformations can also be desirable for diesel and other fuel oils, in which shorter alkanes are involved. These hydroisomerization reactions depend on a delicate balance between the degree of framework confinement and the size of alkane molecules.",
                        "Zeolites play numerous important roles in modern petroleum refineries and have the potential to advance the production of fuels and chemical feedstocks from renewable resources. The performance of a zeolite as a catalyst can depend on its framework structure and the type or location of active sites. To date, 213 framework types have been synthesized and >330,000 thermodynamically accessible zeolite structures have been predicted. Hence, identification of optimal zeolites for a given application from the large number of candidate structures is attractive for accelerating the pace of materials discovery.",
                        "A bi-functional catalyst system comprising a high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, proton-exchanged zeolite and a supported group VIII metal can catalyze the hydroisomerization reactions of naphtha range distillates (C5-12) by converting linear alkanes into branched isomers, thereby increasing the octane number of product gasoline. This type of technology is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,301,917 with rare-earth-metal, proton-exchanged FAU-type zeolites and Pt as the catalyst, which does not prevent cracking. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,423,568 and 3,673,267 both use Pt and MOR-type zeolites, a catalyst more selective towards isomerization than cracking at low conversions. Similar technology to dewax feedstocks of heavier hydrocarbons is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,220, which uses Pt and BEA-type zeolites to treat C10+ species. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,302,279, 5,358,628, and 5,885,438 combine hydroisomerization with other technologies such as solvent extraction and hydrocracking to further improve lubricant base oil quality. U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,138 discloses the application of a new catalyst system consisting of Pt and silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites in a dewaxing process with substantially less cracking. The SAPO zeolites can be of the AEL, ATO, or AFO type, and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,485. Zeolites with high hydroisomerization selectivity continue to be reported, including combinations of zeolites of different framework types, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,990,371, 6,051,129, 6,652,735, 6,962,651, and 2007/0029230."

                        "A hydrocarbon feedstock for lubricant base oils can vary widely in its composition, with the content of waxy linear alkanes ranging from a few percent to over 90% in the case of Fischer-Tropsch-derived stock. Linear long-chain alkanes can crystallize at above room temperature and cause the pour point of the feed mixture to be much higher than most specifications (e.g., 243-263 K). Introducing branches to the alkane molecules can decrease the pour point. On the other hand, excessive branching can lower the viscosity index. In addition, molecules with branching at two nearby carbon atoms and in the center of a chain can be susceptible to cracking. Therefore, a hydroisomerization dewaxing process can be configured to control for the degree of branching. Other aspects about the feedstock can include the presence of impurities, such as unsaturated aliphatics and aromatics, which can have poor viscosity index and can be oxidized to start a series of reactions that can adversely affect the quality of the lubricant oils. These impurities generally need to be removed along with sulfur, nitrogen, and metals via hydrotreating or hydrocracking, or both, prior to hydroisomerization.",
                        "As noted above, zeolites have been used to catalyze the conversion of linear long-chain alkanes to slightly branched alkanes of similar molecular weight. However, as further noted above, the hydroisomerization reactions to convert long-chain alkanes depend on a delicate balance between the degree of framework confinement and the size of alkane molecules. Moreover, experimental testing of all existing known zeolites for a given application would be very time and labor intensive, sometimes even infeasible when a synthesis protocol for the material with the desired composition is not yet developed. In addition, the possible number of synthesizable zeolites is enormously large, with some of the structures found in the predicted crystallography open database (PCOD) possessing potentially much better characteristics. Selecting optimal candidate materials through predictive modeling is hence a very attractive proposition. Such screening studies have so far focused mostly on single-component adsorption of small, rigid, non-hydrogen-bonding molecules, such as H2, CH4, and CO2. Screening sorbents and catalysts for complex mixtures composed of large, articulated molecules, where advanced algorithms are required for sampling the distribution of thousands of conformers, or polar, hydrogen-bonding molecules, where an accurate description of electrostatics and the resulting mixture non-idealities are of paramount importance, has so far been an intractable problem. Enabled by a multistep screening workflow, efficient sampling algorithms, accurate force fields, and a two-level parallel execution hierarchy utilizing up to 131,072 computer cores on a supercomputer, the inventors have engaged in high-throughput-screening for conversion of linear alkanes and slightly branched alkanes of more moderate molecular weight, e.g., having 18-30 carbon atoms.",
                        "The inventors have identified, through a large-scale, multi-step computational screening process, promising zeolite structures capable of providing a catalyst system that can provide adsorption that is up to two orders of magnitude better than current technology for linear and slightly branched alkanes with 18-30 carbon atoms, such as those encountered in petroleum refining. A suitable zeolite can possess a high affinity for linear alkanes but low affinity for branched isomers, so that the desired mono-branched products are not being cracked into smaller species.",
                        "The present disclosure describes a dewaxing process that comprises contacting, under hydroisomerization conditions, the hydrocarbon feedstock with a bi-functional catalyst system comprising one or more zeolites and a hydrogenation component. The framework types of the one or more zeolites can be selected to minimize cracking while maximize the hydroisomerization of linear alkanes. The hydrogenation component can comprise at least one Group VIII metal, Group VIB metal, or Group IB metal. At least a fraction of the waxy linear or slightly branched alkanes or side chains can be converted by contacting with the catalyst system.",
                        "Zeolites in the catalyst system can provide Br\u00f8nsted acid functionality. The zeolites can be partially or fully proton-exchanged. The desired SiO2/Al2O3 ratio can be very high, so that the acid strength is weak and cracking is minimized. The zeolites selected can contain a channel system of medium pore sizes that can be constructed from 10-12 member rings and characterized by a roughly symmetrical shape and a pore diameter of from about 0.45 nanometers (nm) to about 0.7 nm. For example, zeolites useful in the conversion process of the present disclosure can include one-dimensional structures of CAN, EUO, GON, and VET framework type zeolites or three-dimensional structures of WEN and ITH framework type zeolites. Zeolites of different framework types can also be used together, either as mixtures, stacked layers, separated, or any other configuration in which the feedstock is brought into contact with all of the zeolites simultaneously or sequentially. In order to improve catalyst utilization, the form of the zeolites can be made as small crystals or hierarchical materials with mesopores.",
                        "The hydrogenation component (e.g., Group VIII metals, Group VIB metals, or Group IB metals) can provide hydrogenation functionality. In an example, the hydrogenation component can be selected from Group VIII metals, such as from Pt, Pd, or mixtures thereof. The metals can be incorporated into a zeolite by any of the known techniques, such as occlusion, impregnation, and ion exchange, in either elemental form or as oxides, sulfides, or mixtures thereof. The amount of the hydrogenation component can be small, for example ranging from about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, such as from about 0.2 wt % to about 1 wt % of the catalyst system.",
                        "The hydroisomerization process can be operated with added hydrogen, but can also be carried out in the absence of hydrogen. The reaction can occur at a temperature of about 473-773 K. The reaction can occur at a pressure of from about 0.1 MPa to about 20 MPa. The reaction can proceed at a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of from about 0.1 hr\u22121 to about 20 hr\u22121. The lower end of these values of temperature, pressure, and LHSV can promote isomerization, while the higher end of these value ranges can promote cracking. The base oil product of the hydroisomerization reaction can further be hydrofinished and additized.",
                        "There is also provided herein a method for systematic discovery of zeolite framework types that are suitable for processes such as the dewaxing processes described above. The method of systematic discovery can comprise assembling a group of a plurality of candidate zeolite structures. Each candidate of the plurality of candidate zeolite structures can be evaluated based on several key quantities, and finally a composite score can be formed for each candidate. In one example, the plurality of candidate zeolite structures can include experimentally synthesized zeolites such as those deposited in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database or the database maintained by IZA-SC. It further includes zeolite structures that have been predicted to be thermodynamically accessible but have not been synthesized yet, such as those deposited in the PCOD database and described in Pophale et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 13, 12407 (2011), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as if reproduced herein in its entirety. The group of candidate structures can be first pruned using a fast procedure, such as geometric analysis or short calculations, or both, in order to eliminate structures that are unattractive for the target application. The surviving candidates can then be subjected to careful evaluation, at representative reaction conditions (for example for a prototypical multi-component feed mixture, at a temperature of 573 K and a pressure of 3 MPa), of a few quantities that are chosen to reflect different facets of the isomerization conversion: high affinity towards linear alkanes as indicated by the equilibrium loading of n-octadecane (QnC18), high adsorption selectivity of linear over branched alkanes as indicated by Equation [1],",

Previously, Dubbeldam et al. screened about 100 nanoporous materials for the adsorption of hexane and heptane isomers. In this Example, >330,000 zeolite structures in the IZA-SC and PCOD databases were screened. To represent the complex hydrocarbon feed, an equimolar mixture of n-octadecane (C18), n-tetracosane (C24), n-triacontane (C30), 2-methyl and 4-methylheptadecane (2C17 and 4C17), and 2,2-dimethylhexadecane (22C16) was employed. Three factors are considered to contribute to performance: (i) high affinity towards linear alkanes as indicated by Henry's constant, kH,C18, at low pressure or loading, QC18, at P=3 MPa for C18; (ii) high selectivity for linear versus branched alkanes as indicated by SBn=3yC18/(y2C17+y22C16) where n=0 or 3 and y=kH or Q depending on state point; and (iii) low selectivity between linear alkanes of different lengths as indicated by SLn=(yC24yc30)1/2/yC18 so that a broad range of linear alkanes may be converted; the resulting performance metric is PHCn=yC18SBn/SLn.",

Screening the IZA-SC database reveals that six of the top-7 structures (ATO, MRE, MTT, AFO, MTW, and FER) are already known for isodewaxing. This strongly indicates that our screening procedure, although based solely on adsorption properties, is able to capture the essential characteristics responsible for high-performing hydroisomerization catalysts and can thus provide useful guidance for experimental synthesis of novel zeolite catalysts. Thus, the pool of candidate materials was expanded to include zeolite-like structures in the PCOD database. Materials that are among the top-64 in the IZA-SC database or top-1024 in the PCOD database in any of the three performance indicators (for a total of 103 and 2835 structures, respectively) are retained for longer simulations in the low-pressure limit and for an equimolar mixture of all six components at T=573 K and p=3 MPa, a typical operation condition for the hydroisomerization conversion.",
                                "FIG. 1a illustrates the relationships between kH and the adsorption enthalpy, \u0394Hads, for C18 adsorption in the low-pressure limit. A more favorable \u0394Hads generally leads to a larger kH, but the correlation is fairly weak. This reflects enthalpy-entropy compensation where a smaller entropic loss in a wider channel can compensate for a smaller enthalpic gain, as seen by data points for frameworks with larger free channel diameters being more frequently located toward the upper right corner in FIG. 1a. A strong affinity for C18, as indicated by large kH,C18, is well correlated with an even stronger affinity for C24 and C30, i.e., large SL0, but not correlated with a preference for linear versus branched alkanes, e.g., large SB0. It was found that SB0 is best correlated with the pore bumpiness, \u0394d=dincl\u2212dfree where the first and second terms are the diameter of the largest sphere that can be placed anywhere along a given channel, and the diameter of the largest sphere that can roam freely through the channel. As shown in FIG. 1b, a narrow and smooth channel yields high selectivity for linear alkanes, whereas a narrow but bumpy channel with \u0394d\u22480.3 nm leads to inverse selectivity where adsorption of the branched alkanes is preferred.",
                                "FIGS. 1c and 1d compares adsorption characteristics calculated in the infinite dilution limit and at hydroisomerization conditions. For both IZA-SC and PCOD structures, there is only a weak correlation between the low-pressure affinity and the high-pressure loading because larger pores allow for high loading but are not most favorable for individual sorbates (see FIG. 1a). The two selectivities exhibit markedly different trends as pressure is increased: SB remains nearly constant, whereas SL decreases significantly for the majority of zeolites. Longer alkanes have much smaller vapor pressures and, correspondingly, the free energy penalty for them to leave the liquid phase is larger than for shorter alkanes and compensates for the more favorable free energy of adsorption. As a result, SL reduces to around 1-10 at p=3 MPa. The complex pressure dependency of SL illustrates the shortcomings of using infinite-dilution data to extrapolate material performance at other conditions.",
                                "FIG. 1e compares the top-10 structures (as ranked by PHC3) from each database. Numerical values are provided in Table 1.",
                                "The top 3 (ATO, MRE, and AFO), and another four from the top 10 (AEL, MTT, FER, and TON) IZA-SC structures are known to excel for this petrochemical application; fourth and seventh ranked CAN and WEN* have performance indicators resembling the other structures, whereas EUO yields a lower SB3 that is compensated by a more favorable SL3. Top-ranked ATO features the highest QC18, the second lowest (favorable) SL3, and the fourth highest SB3. The largest variation among the top-10 IZA-SC structures is found for SB3 that range from 2-50, whereas QC18 and SL3 vary only by factors of 3 and 5. The top-10 PCOD structures exhibit PHC3 values that are about two orders of magnitude higher than those for the high-performing IZA-SC structures. This dramatically improved performance arises mainly from their exceptionally high SB3 values, whereas their QC18 and SL3 values tend to be slightly less favorable than for the IZA-SC structures (as indicated by the five structures labeled PCOD-S, there are also structures that match the QC18 and SL3 values of the top IZA-SC performers and still outperform them). The performance differences are much larger in the low-pressure limit where some PCOD structures yield kH,C18 and SB0 values that exceed those of the IZA-SC structures by 3 and 7 orders of magnitude, respectively (see Table 1 and FIG. 2).",
                                "In FIG. 3, the arrangement of the adsorbed hydrocarbons in ATO, MTW, and PCOD-8113534 are compared. As can be seen, the top-performing structures all possess one-dimensional 12-ring channel architectures and these systems are near saturation loading at p=3 MPa. ATO and PCOD-8113534 are the top-ranked IZA-SC and PCOD structure and also perform exceptionally well in the low-pressure limit. MTW is a framework type and is the sixth-ranked structure at low pressure, but only ranks 28th at p=3 MPa because of a large decrease in SB. The SB3 values for these three structures are 21, 2.8, and 16000, respectively. As expected from the large SB3, in PCOD-8113534's elliptic channels with a semi-minor axis length of only 0.47 nm the linear alkanes are highly confined with a preference to have their zig-zag plane aligned along the semi-major elliptic axis and exhibit very few gauched effects at the chain termini. ATO's channels possess a cross section resembling a regular hexagon with dfree=0.57 nm, and the zig-zag plane of the alkanes is free to rotate; in addition to end-gauche defects, kink defects (gtg\u2032) are also observed. The even larger elliptic channels in MTW afford sufficient room for few 22C16 molecules and gttg\u2032 kinks in linear chains."

In our simulations, the zeolite frameworks are assumed to be rigid, while sorbate molecules sample angle bending and dihedral motions. To improve computational efficiency, grid files for the interaction energy of a test particle with the zeolite were generated in a manner that contains the repulsive LJ, attractive LJ, and the short- and long-range Coulomb components, but is independent of the specific force field parameters for the sorbate molecule; therefore the same grid files can facilitate screening calculations for other applications. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the grand-canonical ensemble (CB-GCMC) were used to compute the sorbate loadings as function of the partial pressure for the alkanes using chemical potentials determined from liquid-phase simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. In the infinite-dilution limit, these CB-GCMC simulations also yield directly kH and \u0394Hads. To carry out the energy grid tabulation and CB-GCMC simulations in a high-throughput fashion, a two-level parallel execution hierarchy exploring simultaneously 27 to 214 zeolite structures and accelerating the simulations for each structure by spreading the computational load over 22 to 28 computer cores was employed.
