    "abstract": "The present invention concerns a method for functionalization, via topographical modification, of the surfaces of nanofibrillated (NFC) cellulose films into non-porous, water-resistant platforms, usable in diagnostic applications. The method includes a carboxylation of the NFC-film via TEMPO-mediated oxidation, and optionally an activation via EDS/NHS chemistry and, finally, the reactivity of the film can be tested using anti-human IgG.

                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "The present invention concerns a method for topographical modification of nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) films that have been activated with TEMPO-oxidation, as well as the use of these films as a platform for, e.g. diagnostical assays.",
                        "2. Description of Related Art",
                        "Polymeric materials (such as plastics) made of fossil sources have been utilized in different medical and diagnostical applications as a nonporous support material (see e.g. Wu P., et al., 2008; Yager P., et al., 2006; Lequin R. M., 2005). However, these plastics are non-renewable oil based materials, the commercial utilization of which in large scale must be considered harmful for the environment.",
                        "Cellulose and cellulose derivatives could be a viable alternative, due to their inherent properties such as non-toxicity, hydrophilicity, and chemical resistivity (see e.g. Sir\u00f3 I. and Plackett D., 2010; Pelton R., 2009), but they tend to have a high porosity that makes them unpractical. Of the cellulose derivatives, for example nitrocellulose has been used as a supporting material (see e.g. Mansfield M. A., 2005), here for conjugating antibodies in diagnostic assays. However, nitrocellulose has certain disadvantages such as non-optimal mechanical strength, flammability, and the affinity to adsorb proteins non-specifically, due to its cationic charge.",
                        "Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), produced from wood fibres via mechanical or chemical disintegration (such as in Saito T., et al., 2007; and P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6 M., et al., 2007), exhibits interesting properties such as high surface area, high hydrogen bonding ability, and good mechanical strength (see e.g. Syverud K. and Stenius P., 2009; and Yano H. and Nakahara, S., 2004). This material can be used to manufacture strong and chemically resistant materials.",
                        "Recently, NFC-gel has been used to manufacture nearly transparent and smooth films (see e.g. Karabulut E. and Wagberg L., 2011; Spence K., et al., 2010; and Nogi M., et al., 2009). These films can be improved by using low charged pulp as raw material. This significantly reduces the water impregnation, probably because of the small porosity and compact structure of NFC-films (Osterberg M., et al., 2013). Water resistant NFC-films would be useful in the diagnostical applications where the penetration of analyte in the supporting material is undesired. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of such NFC-films could be beneficial for reducing proteins non-specific adsorption (see e.g. Norde W., 1996).",
                        "Derivatisation of NFC via TEMPO-mediated oxidation is a technique that is used to selectively convert the primary hydroxyls of cellulose to their carboxyl form, which could be further utilized in various applications, such as immunoassays (see e.g. Saito T., et al., 2007; De Nooy A., et al., 1995; Isogai A. and Kato Y., 1998; Saito T., et al., 2006; Saito T. and Isogai A., 2004; Habibi Y., et al., 2006).",
                        "The oxidation reaction occurs more rapidly at the regions that are easily accessible for the oxidation chemicals. TEMPO-oxidized NFC-gel has been used in highly transparent films with low air permeability (see e.g. Fukuzumi H., et al., 2009), but unfortunately these films have quite low water resistance, due to the high homogenously distributed surface charge of the oxidized cellulose nanofibrils.",
                        "Surface specific oxidation of water resistant NFC-films could offer an alternative pathway to produce immunodiagnostic platforms with low porosity, high stability and suitable conjugation sites for immobilization of proteins. The compact and closed structure of these NFC-films limits the amount of diffused water which in turn diminishes the oxidation reaction inside the film's structure (see e.g. Spence K., et al., 2010).",
                        "Utilization of the inkjet printing technique on the deposition of biosensors and immunoassays on paper and other supports has been widely reported (see e.g. Abe K., et al., 2008; Hossain S. M., et al., 2009; Di Risio S. and Yan N. J., 2010; Lonini L., et al., 2008). The main advantages of the inkjet printing technique are the small demand of printing liquids (expensive purified antibodies and enzymes can be used; as in Delaney J. T., et al., 2009), and the lack of physical contact with the object, which reduces the risk of the surface contamination. Moreover, the small droplet size (in the scale of pico liters), allows for controlling the surface concentration of sensing molecules (see e.g. Rose D., 1999).",
                        "Traditionally, functionalized cellulose films are, however, still manufactured from prefunctionalized raw materials. This functionalization takes place also in the inner parts of cellulose film that promotes its stability in water, whereas a topographic surface modification would allow a functionalization of only the surface."

The reaction kinetics of the reaction is extremely fast that allows use short reaction time that prevents the diffusion of chemicals in the NFC-films. Also the structure of NFC-films decreases the accessibility of reaction chemicals to diffuse in the film.",
                        "Due to the fast reaction kinetics, a maximum amount of carboxyl groups should have been generated in less than 10 minutes, whereby the reaction can be stopped already after a time of, for example 10 to 300 sec. The reaction is stopped, for example by the addition of ethanol and by washing to remove the carboxylation chemicals.",
                        "According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, one or more further surface modification steps are carried out subsequent to the carboxylation.",

This reaction will change the NFC surface into a more amine-reactive form.",

                        "This esterification is generally carried out in an aqueous solution (including the EDC and the NHS) at a slightly acidic pH, such as a pH of 4-6, preferably about 5. The reaction is relatively fast, and a maximum amount of ester groups should have been generated in less than 30 minutes.",
                        "Subsequently, the thus activated NFC-films can be used for supporting materials for conjugated molecules. Thereby, an optional conjugation of DNA, antibodies or proteins on the activated NFC-films can be carried out, as demonstrated in the examples below using polyclonal anti-human IgG and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by inkjet and adsorption methods.",
                        "Thus, either alternatively or additionally (particularly subsequent to the optional esterification step), the further surface modification steps can include, for example a step wherein the prepared surface-reactive NFC film is modified by attaching amine-containing molecules, such as biomolecules (including proteins, DNA and antibodies) to the carboxyl groups formed on the surface of the film during the oxidative activation.",
                        "The amine-containing molecules can be selected from, e.g. biomolecules, preferably from proteins, DNA and antibodies, more preferably from either water-soluble proteins, such as albumins, or from monomeric immunoglobulins, such as IgG, IgD and IgE, most suitably from bovine serum albumin (BSA) or an immunoglobulin IgG. Generally, these amine-containing molecules will attach to either the carboxyl groups or the ester groups on the NFC surface.",

(1998). Briefly: 0.13 mmol TEMPO and 4.7 mmol NaBr were dissolved in 100 ml of MilliQ-purified water. Then 5.65 mmol NaClO was added in the solution, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by adding 1M HCl.

The NFC-films were kept in the solution varying times from 10 to 300 sec, and the oxidation reaction was stopped by an ethanol addition and washing with the large extent of MilliQ purified water, respectively, to remove carboxylation chemicals.

The wire markings from the filtration membrane are clearly visible, while no macroscale voids or pores were observed, suggesting a uniform NFC-film surface, with RMS roughness of about 6.8\u00b11.0 \u03bcm. The low porosity and the water resistance are expected to reduce the diffusion of biomolecules into the NFC-film, enhancing the specificity of the immunoassay.",
                                "The substantial increase of carboxyl groups on the surface of TEMPO-oxidized NFC-films was verified with by conductometric and contact angle measurements (FIG. 3). This analysis measures the hydrophilicity on the modified surfaces. The measurements were carried out using a contact angle goniometer CAM 200 (KSV instruments Ltd, Helsinki, Finland). Measurements were performed at room temperature with water as a probe liquid. The droplet volume of 6.5 \u03bcl was used with a recording time of 120 sec for measuring the time dependency of the contact angle. The contact angles were measured on the three different spots on each sample.",
                                "The contact angles were seen to decrease rapidly as a function of oxidation time. The contact angle of the unmodified NFC-film was 44\u00b0, i.e. similar to the values reported elsewhere (see Spence K., et al., 2010). However, after only 10 seconds of oxidation, the contact angle was reduced from 44\u00b0 to 19\u00b0 indicating quite hydrophilic surface. Furthermore, prolonged oxidation (over 30 seconds) was found to produce extremely hydrophilic surfaces pushing contact angle values well below the detection limit of 15\u00b0. This demonstrates the fast reaction kinetics of TEMPO-oxidation which allows for rapid carboxylation of NFC-film. The contact angles of the carboxylated NFC-films seemed to be even lower than in films which were prepared from TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (pre-oxidation; see Fukuzumi H., et al., 2009). A plausible reason for this could be the high surface carboxyl content of the NFC-film, and peeling reactions that have been found to open the structure of cellulose microfibrils increasing the effective surface area (see Hirota M., et al., 2010).",
                                "The changes on the total charge due to the TEMPO-oxidation were followed by conductometric titration (FIG. 3). This procedure measures the increase in the charged groups (carboxyls) on the NFC films after the TEMPO treatment. It is important to note here that only the total extent of weak acid groups (only carboxyls are observed) can be measured by the conductometric method.",
                                "The analysis was carried out using a conductometric titrator 751 GPD Titrino (Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland) following the standard SCAN-CM 65:02. The NFC-films (size 2.5\u00d72.5 cm2) were acid washed with 0.01 M HCl for 1 hour, and disintegrated in MilliQ-water with a blade type homogenizer Polytron PT 2000 (Kinematica Inc., NY, USA). The conductometric titration was performed by adding 0.02 ml of 0.1 M NaOH within 30 sec intervals. The amount of weak acid groups (carboxyls) was calculated as is described in the standard (SCAN-CM 65:02).",
                                "The charge of the unmodified NFC-film was 72 \u03bceq/g (reference), most likely due to the presence of hemicelluloses deriving from the hardwood pulp used for the NFC manufacturing process (see P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6 M., et al., 2007). This charge was elevated more than two-fold (169 \u03bceq/g) even after a short 30 sec oxidation period. Moreover, the charge curve from FIG. 3 reveals that after 2 min of oxidation, the charge increase slows down to a plateau, indicating complete oxidation. The highest charge was found after 5 min oxidation (237 \u03bceq/g) was interpreted to be close to the maximum carboxyl content that can be achieved without breaking the film's structure. This maximum was significantly lower than that of the individual TEMPO-oxidized nanofibrils (charge 1500 \u03bceq/g; see Saito T., et al., 2006), strongly suggesting that the carboxylation reaction mainly occurred at the surface of the NFC-film. The aldehyde content of the NFC-film was not measured since only the carboxyl groups were utilized for the following EDC/NHS activation reaction (see Hermanson G. T., 2008).",
                                "The water resistance of TEMPO-oxidized NFC-films was tested by immersing them in water for several hours. The films remained intact thus suggesting that the carboxyl formation likely occurred only on the surface of a NFC-film because the oxidation inside the film would result in swelling and subsequent disintegration of the film.",
                                "The activation of the TEMPO-oxidized NFC was first verified by using the on-line QCM-D technique with NFC-model surfaces. The frequency shifts observed in a QCM are related to the gain or loss of mass on the sensor. However, it is important to consider that the changes in frequency are also affected by water coupling to the film. Note that the data range on the frequency axis in the QCM isotherms is the negative change in frequency; so in these profiles an increment of the signal indicates mass being increased (adsorption or water coupling) and a decrease of the signal indicates the loss of mass (desorption or hydrolysis). The NFC model surfaces were first carboxylated for 2 min by feeding a solution containing the chemicals needed for TEMPO-oxidation. This treatment caused an instant drop on the QCM frequency curve that is likely related to the formation of new carboxyl groups with increased amount of coupled water (FIG. 4a). It should be mentioned here that simultaneously recorded dissipation curve also raised drastically, which is indicative of thickened layer of coupled water on the NFC-surface (data not shown). As expected, the MilliQ-water rinsing further decreased the frequency values (change from \u221275 Hz to \u2212130 Hz) and increased the dissipation values (change 35\u00d710\u22126). This indicates that the removal of salts and other chemicals from the bulk phase is neutralizing the charge which in turn promotes the swelling of the NFC-film. The mass of the coupled water after TEMPO-oxidation and MilliQ-water rinsing was found to be 25.3 mg/m2, which corresponds to the change of thickness of 25.3 nm if the water layer is assumed to be on a flat surface. However, the addition of sodium acetate buffer reduced the swelling of the NFC film which appears as an increase in the frequency curve. The EDC/NHS treatment of carboxylated NFC-surface decreased both the frequency (change over \u221225 Hz after buffer rinsing) and the dissipation values. This demonstrates the formation of NHS-esters and simultaneous decrease in anionic charge which reduces the swelling of the NFC-film. After buffer rinsing, the frequency and the dissipation curves quickly reached the plateau levels, which indicates stable attachment of NHS-esters on the NFC-surface. No desorption of NHS-esters was observed during the extended rinsing period. Next, the activated NFC-film was dried with nitrogen gas and stored overnight in a desiccator in prior to the reactivity test with BSA.",
                                "The TEMPO-oxidized NFC films before and after EDC/NHS activation were also analyzed by XPS. While the carboxylation of the NFC films could not be followed via XPS measurements (as reported by e.g. DiFlavio J., et al., 2007), most probably due to the medium-dependent surface adaptation of cellulose in dry medium (see Johansson L., et al., 2011), the esterification of the carboxyl groups leads to carbonyl groups, which are detectable (see e.g. Uschanov P., et al., 2011). Furthermore, the NHS-esters formed during film activation contain nitrogen not otherwise present in non-treated nor carboxylated film, so also nitrogen signal may be used as a fingerprint.",
                                "The topmost 10 nanometers of the films were examined using a Kratos Analytical AXIS 165 electron spectrometer with a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-Ray source at 100 W and a neutralizer. The XPS experiments were performed on the dry films, which were pre-evacuated overnight. At least three different spots of each sample were scanned. Spectra were collected at an electron take-off angle of 90\u00b0 from sample areas less than one mm in diameter. Elemental surface compositions were determined from low-resolution measurements (80 eV pass energy and 1 eV step) while the surface chemistry was probed with high resolution measurements (20 eV pass energy and 0.1 eV step). The carbon C1s high-resolution spectra were curve fitted using parameters defined for cellulosic materials (see Johansson L. and Campbell J. M., 2004), and all binding energies were referenced to the aliphatic carbon component of the C1s signal at 285.0 eV (see Beamson G. and Briggs D., 1992). According to the in-situ reference (100% cellulose ash free filter paper), measured along with each sample batch, the conditions in UHV remained satisfactory during the XPS experiments (see Johansson L. and Campbell J. M., 2004).",
                                "The XPS spectra in FIG. 5 shows that all the sample surfaces analysed were clean and had features characteristic of cellulose. Even the significant non-cellulosic C\u2014C component in the non-modified and carboxylated films is in good accordance with other reports. However, after the EDC/NHS activation there is a clear nitrogen signal, accompanied by a similar increase in the C 1s carbonyl component (FIG. 5 and Table 1).",
                                "The topographical changes at a nanoscale (images of 1\u00d71 \u03bcm2) were characterized by the AFM (FIG. 6a-c). In addition, images of 5\u00d75 \u03bcm2 are shown in the FIG. 7. On the unmodified NFC-film were cellulose nanofibril clusters clearly observable. Those clusters were originated from the mechanical homogenization that does not produce individual nanofibrils as can be obtained using the TEMPO-method (see Saito T. and Isogai A., 2004). No indications of large voids or pores were observed, which indicates that the natural affinity between cellulose fibrils lead to formation of a rather evenly distributed film. The roughness of the unmodified NFC-film was about 35.4 nm. After the TEMPO-oxidation the surface of the NFC-film was only slightly altered. The fibrillar structure was covered by a gel like layer that was also observable in the increased phase difference (see FIG. 8) corresponding to softening of the surface. Presumably this gel like structure was caused by carboxylated cellulose nanofibrils, which binds significant amount of water (see QCM-D data FIG. 4a) also from the room atmosphere, clinging the AFM tip to the film surface. The roughness of the TEMPO-oxidized NFC-film was about 44.5 nm. After NHS-activation, the fibrillar structure was clearly covered by coupled NHS-molecules. The EDC/NHS activation removes the charge of the NFC-film reducing the water binding capacity that can be seen in FIG. 7c, where the surface is similar compared to the unmodified NFC-film. The roughness of the activated NFC-film was about 49.6 nm. These results demonstrate that the coupled NHS-molecules were present on the NFC-film after the drying period.",
                                "The interaction and reaction analyses on NFC-surfaces were carried out in a QCM-D E4 instrument (Biolin Scientific AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). The principle of the QCM-D technique is described more detailed elsewhere (see e.g. H\u00f6\u00f6k F., et al., 1998; Rodahl M., et al., 1995). All measurements were performed using a constant 100 \u03bcl/min flow rate, fixed 25\u00b0 C. temperature, and all tests were repeated at least twice. The mathematical modeling to calculate the mass adsorption on the NFC-surfaces were carried out using the Johannsmann's model as is described by Johannsmann D., et al. (1992). Johannsmann's model is an iterative model using frequency overtones 3, 5, and 7 of the QCM-D crystal.",
                                "The TEMPO-mediated oxidation reaction with NFC-surfaces was tested in the QCM-D. The TEMPO-solution (0.13 mmol TEMPO, 4.7 mmol NaBr, and 5.65 mmol NaClO in MilliQ-purified water with fixed pH of 10) was allowed to flow over NFC-surfaces for 2 min. The oxidation reaction was then stopped by adding ethanol in the activation solution (10% from the volume of the activation solution), and then the solution was allowed to flow 2 min through the QCM-D chambers that interrupted the carboxylation reaction. Then the carboxylated NFC-surfaces were rinsed with a MilliQ-water treatment for 20 min to remove carboxylation chemicals. Finally, the surfaces were stabilized in 10 mM NaOAc at pH 5. The carboxylated NFC-surfaces were activated with a mixed solution of 0.1 M EDC with 0.4 M NHS in 10 mM NaOAc at pH 5 for 20 min that converts the carboxyl groups of TEMPO-oxidized NFC to amine reactive NHS-esters. Unused activation chemicals were then rinsed out with a buffer rinsing. The activated NFC-surfaces were finally dried with nitrogen gas, and stored in a desiccator if is not otherwise stated.",

                                "To demonstrate the amine reactivity of activated NFC, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was chosen to provide a weight marker that is easily detectable in QCM-D monitoring. BSA (0.1 mg/ml) was adsorbed at pH 5 on the unmodified, TEMPO-oxidized and NHS-activated NFC-surfaces and the resulting surfaces were sequentially rinsed with NaOAc (pH 5), 10 mM NaCl (pH 10) and NaOAc (pH 5) buffer solutions, respectively (FIG. 4b). The control experiment with unmodified NFC-surface revealed irreversible binding of BSA as observed by negative frequency shift (\u22128 Hz, 1.6 mg/m2). This is not totally surprising since at the isoelectric point (pI) of BSA (ca. pH of 5) rather large amounts of this biomolecule have been found to adsorb on cellulose surfaces (see Orelma H., et al., 2011). In general, similar observations for the adsorption of BSA on non-cellulosic surfaces have been noted elsewhere as a result of reduced solvency at the pI (see Su T. J., et al., 1998; and Malmsten M., et al., 1998). However, it is noteworthy that alkaline buffer rinsing did not remove the bound BSA as could have been expected based on the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged BSA and negatively charged NFC-surface. One possible explanation is the low negative charge of an unmodified NFC-surface.",
                                "Adsorption of BSA on a TEMPO-oxidized NFC-surface was found to be significantly higher (\u221235 Hz, 6.8 mg/m2) than that on the unmodified NFC-surface. However, the binding of BSA was reversible as the alkaline buffer rinsing completely removed the bound protein. This is likely due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged BSA (pI is 5; see B\u00f6hme U. and Scheler U., 2007) and negatively charged carboxylated TEMPO-oxidized NFC-surface (pI of carboxyls about 4.5; see Hoogendam C. W., et al., 1998). Furthermore, this demonstrates the regenerability of the carboxylated NFC-surface. The adsorption of BSA on TEMPO-oxidized NFC-surface was also tested at pH 7.4 and no adsorption was observed because of the electrostatic repulsion forces (data not shown). The initial adsorption of BSA on NHS-activated NFC-surface was found to be higher (\u221250 Hz, 9.8 mg/m2) than that on unmodified and TEMPO-oxidized NFC-surfaces. This can be explained by the esterification of free carboxylates which in turn reduces the negative charge of the NFC-surface, increasing the hydrophobicity of the surface that is beneficial for the adsorption of proteins (see Martin M. J., 1998). It can be seen from FIG. 4b that even after alkaline buffer rinsing approximately half (\u221225 Hz, 4.9 mg/m2) of the initially adsorbed BSA remains on the NFC-surface. This is most likely due to the hydrolyzation of NHS-esters groups in alkaline condition that increases the negative charge of the activated NFC-surface (see Hermanson G. T., 2008; Staros J. V., et al., 1986). This anionic charge with anionic charged proteins causes an electrostatic repulsion that removes electrostatically bound proteins. This clearly demonstrates that the EDC/NHS assisted activation of TEMPO-oxidized NFC-surface creates a topographical amine reactive platform, which can be used for the covalent conjugation of amine-bearing biomolecules.",
                                "The attachment of antibodies on the activated NFC-films was investigated by using an adsorption method with FITC-staining by the CLSM (FIG. 9). The fluorescence imaging was carried out using laser wavelength 488 nm, where fluorescein produces an emission at wavelength around of 520 nm. In addition, no any auto-fluorescence of activated NFC was observed. The 0.1 mg/ml stained anti-human IgG was allowed to adsorb on the unmodified NFC- and the activated NFC-film. The surfaces were then treated with ethanolamine and 10 mM NaCl at pH 10, respectively, for remove unused NHS-groups and electrostatically bound antibodies. On the unmodified NFC-film the adsorption of anti-human IgG was low (FIG. 9a), which can be seen in the small fluorescence emission (intensity is about 1.8). Whereas, on the activated NFC-surface (FIG. 9b) the bounding was drastically higher (intensity is about 18.76). This result demonstrates that the activation of the NFC-surface led to stable conjugation of antibodies. Whereas, electrostatically bound anti-human IgG was washed out from the unmodified NFC-film in the pH 10 solution washing. In addition, the lattice type marking was observed on the fluorescence image (FIG. 9b), which is originated from the manufacturing process of the NFC-film. The immobilization of anti-human IgG on surface activated NFC-films was also verified by XPS (see the above FIG. 5), where nitrogen was used as a fingerprint. Unstained anti-human IgG was adsorbed on activated NFC-film similarly as is presented above. The film was extensively rinsed with ethanolamine and pH 10 solution for removing electrostatically bound antibodies. The clear increase in the nitrogen content (up to 6 at %, see the above Table 1) confirms the presence of antibodies on NFC-films (FIG. 5). These results again verified the influence of the topographical activation of the NFC-films to conjugate irreversibly antibodies on the NFC-film.",
                                "The reactivity of the activated NFC-surfaces after a drying period (stored in a desiccator for one day) was tested in QCM-D. The pre-activated NFC-surfaces were first stabilized in 10 mM NaoAc at pH 5 for 1 hour, and then 100 \u03bcg/ml BSA in 10 mM NaoAc at pH 5 was adsorbed on the activated NFC-surface for 30 min. The conjugation reaction was confirmed by a sequential rinsing sequence; pH 5 NaOAc buffer, 10 mM NaCl at pH 10, and pH 5 NaOAc buffer, respectively. The alkaline buffer rinsing causes an electrostatic repulsion between BSA and carboxylated NFC that removes the electrostatically bound protein. The adsorption of 100 \u03bcg/ml BSA in 10 mM NaOAc at pH 5 on the unmodified and TEMPO-oxidized NFC-surfaces was tested as a reference similarly as is described above.",
                                "The conjugation of anti-human IgG on activated NFC-surfaces was verified in QCM-D. The NFC surfaces were first activated similarly as is presented above, and then 100 \u03bcg/ml anti-human IgG in 10 mM NaAc at pH 5 was allowed to adsorb on the activated NFC-surface for 30 min followed the buffer rinsing. Unused NHS-esters were then removed by rinsing with 0.1 M ethanol amine at pH 8.5 for 15 min. The non-specific binding of proteins on a biointerface was blocked by a 15 min Superblock treatment. The activity of the conjugated antibody of a biointerface was tested by adsorbing 100 \u03bcg/ml hIgG in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 10 min on the biointerfaces with and without conjugated anti-human IgG. The non-specific adsorption of anti-human IgG and human IgG on unmodified and TEMPO-oxidized NFC surfaces were tested at similar conditions as is presented above.",
                                "QCM-D was exploited to monitor the conjugation reaction of anti-human IgG on the activated NFC-surface and subsequent adsorption of hIgG (FIG. 10). The NFC-surface was first TEMPO-oxidized for 2 min and then activated by adding the EDC/NHS reagent solution. In next step, a solution of anti-human IgG (0.1 mg/ml) was adsorbed on the NHS-activated NFC-surface and rinsed with given buffer solution. The initial adsorbed amount of anti-human IgG after buffer rinsing was found to be approximately \u221290 Hz (18 mg/m2). However, the addition of ethanolamine (pH 8.5) significantly decreased the adsorbed amount which was leveled off to about \u221223 Hz (4.6 mg/m2) after ethanol amine treatment representing the amount of the conjugated anti-body.",
                                "The desorption of antibody during ethanolamine treatment is most likely caused by the conversion of unused carboxyls to corresponding ethylamides, which are somewhat hydrophobic. The increase in hydrophobicity may reduce the specificity of the biointerface due to the hydrophobic interactions between the surface and the proteins, but this was prevented by adsorbing a blocking agent, superblock, before antigen detection to reduce the adsorption of cationically charged hIgG (pI about 8; see Hamilton R., 1987) on the anionic NFC-surface. The adsorption of superblock on the surface where anti-human IgG was installed was low, indicating that the anti-human IgG was covered remarkably the given surface. On the reference surface, without anti-human IgG (see FIG. 11), the frequency change was much larger demonstrating that the superblock treatment altered also the amount of coupled water. As a reference, and to demonstrate the amount of non-specific binding, human IgG was adsorbed to ethanolamine treated NHS-activated NFC-surface. As can be seen from FIG. 11 the final amount of adsorbed human IgG to a reference surface is significantly lower than that of the anti-human IgG containing surface. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of covalently conjugated anti-human IgG in capturing the human IgG from a solution. The 0.1 mg/ml human IgG was adsorbed on the anti-human IgG interface and on the reference surface (without anti-human IgG) at pH 7.4. Human IgG adsorbed on the surface, where anti-human IgG was installed (adsorption about \u22125 Hz, 0.93 mg/m2), whereas on the reference surface no any adsorption was observed. These experiments demonstrate that after the conjugation of anti-human IgG on the NFC-surface via TEMPO-oxidation the antibody was detected specifically. Moreover, the negligible non-specific adsorption of human IgG on the NFC-surface after the superblock treatment enabled the use of NFC-films in immunoassay applications where positively charged target molecules are monitored. The amount of adsorption of human IgG on the anti-human IgG interface was over two-fold higher compared to earlier published data where anti-hIL-1ra antibodies were covalently conjugated on CMC-PEI hydrogel in QCM-D (see Carrigan S. D., et al., 2005).",

The printing conditions were selected using a CMYK color profile that allows printing from a selected cartridge. All other cartridges were filled with 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The anti-human IgG was fluorescence stained using fluorescence dyes of dansyl and FITC following procedures as is presented elsewhere (see Ronald B. J., 2001; Hermanson G. T., 2008). The stained antibody solution was further purified with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter tubes (The cut of Mw of 30 kM) with three pass of phosphate buffer (total rinsing volume of 6 times of the original sample volume). Finally, the stained anti-human IgG was diluted to the final concentration with 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and it was printed instantly on activated NFC-films. The printed NFC-films were then treated with 0.1 M ethanol amine at pH 8.5 for 15 min, and dried at the room temperature.

The 1 mg/ml dansyl stained anti-human IgG at pH 7.4 was printed on the activated NFC-film (FIG. 12a), and the film was then rinsed with ethanolamine to remove unused NHS-groups, which also removes partly the electrostatically bound antibodies. After drying, the dansyl stained anti-human IgG on the NFC-film was illustrated under the UV-light (366 nm), where dansyl has a blue fluorescence emission. It can be seen that the NFC-film produces significant auto-fluorescence under the UV-light (366 nm). However, the texture of the printed anti-human IgG was clearly observable indicating that printed antibodies were irreversible attached on the activated NFC-film. The inkjet printing of anti-human IgG on the activated NFC-film was further analyzed with FITC-staining by CLSM. After printing of the anti-human IgG texture on an activated NFC-surface, the surface was rinsed with ethanolamine and 10 mM NaCl at pH 10 for remove noncovalently bound antibodies. Due to higher magnification of a CLSM instrument only a border of printed texture can be shown.

The topographical changes on the activated NFC-film after printing of a texture of anti-human IgG were imaged by AFM (FIG. 12c).
