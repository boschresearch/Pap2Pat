Moreover, the classical binary computers have become progressively more powerful in recent years as integrated circuit minimum lateral feature sizes have approached 10 nm and smaller.

It has been appreciated that a paradigm shift in computer technology can allow increases in computing power to continue. This paradigm shift has resulted in the innovation of quantum computing systems that exploit quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to increase the computation speed compared to classical computers and enable solving computationally complex problems within timeframes suitable for practical applications."

As circuit feature sizes approach nanometre-scale, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum effects become more significant in integrated circuit design and operation. In the limit, using single particles, for example ions or photons, to represent data, namely in a form of qubits, represents a limit of miniaturization and provides a fastest computing performance, especially when phenomena such as superposition and entanglement are used; such an approach is used in contemporary quantum computers. A general introduction to quantum computation and quantum information is provided in a scientific publication \u201cQuantum computations and quantum information\u201d, Nagy et al., The International Journal of Parallel, Emergent and Distributed Systems, Vol 21, No. 1, Feb 2006, pp. 1-59.",
                                "In some cases, quantum computers and quantum computing systems may exploit the quantum nature of fields and particles to increase the computation speed compared to classical computers to enable solving computationally complex problems within timeframes suitable for practical applications. In classical processing of data, wherein the data is representative of real physical signals for example, many mathematical operations such as computations of means, correlations, Fourier transforms, Hadamard transforms and so forth are used for processing the data. The data to be processed may be considerable in size, for example Terabytes of information, even potentially Petabytes of information, for example acquired from sensor arrays, for example sequentially over a period of time. Processing time and associated latency for processing the data are important factors, for example in real-time control situations. A quantum computer is potentially capable of being configured to process large quantities of data in a highly efficient manner However, a challenging contemporary technical problem is how to configure quantum computers in a most optimal manner to implement such data processing. For example, given a level noise generated by different elements of a quantum circuit, how the quantum computer should be used to perform a computational task (e.g., quantum computational task) is a technical problem, such that the noise generated during the computations does not impose a limit on the minimum computational error that can be achieved.",
                                "It is known practice to use a combination of a classical computer and a quantum computer when seeking to solve extremely complex problems; in the present disclosure, such a combination will be referred to as a quantum computing system. The classical computer uses Silicon integrated circuit devices that are configured to operate at substantially room temperature (circa +20\u00b0 C.), whereas the quantum computer is configured to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures (circa \u2212273\u00b0 C.) in order to function most effectively. When tackling a given computing task, the task can be divided between execution on the classical computer and execution on the quantum computer. Moreover, for certain tasks, the classical computer will be more efficient than the quantum computer for handling simple computational tasks, whereas the quantum computer can potentially solve certain types of computation tasks that would be inefficient to perform on the classical computer. However, transferring tasks between the classical computer and the quantum computer has temporal overhead that is preferably reduced as much as possible in order to achieve an optimal computing performance for the quantum computing system.",
                                "When using such a tandem configuration of a classical computer and quantum computer, it is sometimes convenient, for example to enhance data processing throughput, to perform certain arithmetic computations on the quantum computer rather than on the classical computer. A technical problem that arises therefrom is how to configure a quantum computer most effectively for performing certain types of arithmetic computations in a manner that noise generated during the quantum computation does not impose a constraint on a total number of quantum operations that can be performed for a quantum computational task. Thus, some embodiments of the present disclosure are concerned with addressing a technical problem of configuring a classical computing system coupled in tandem with quantum computer in a manner to provides for more efficient computation of input data to generate corresponding processed output data, and also to reduce a computational error of the processed output data while keeping the quantum noise arising in the quantum computer below a threshold value."

                                "In FIG. 2, there is shown an illustration of an example quantum computing system 10. The quantum computing system 10 may include a control system 20 that is coupled to an array of qubits 30, for example to a given qubit 40. The array of qubits 30 are implemented, for example, using ion traps, Josephson junctions, photonic circuits and so forth. The control system 20 can be coupled to a configuration device 50 that is configured to set initial states of the array of qubits 30. Moreover, the control system 20 is coupled to a control system process control device 60 that is configured to apply a sequence of quantum operations to the array of qubits 30. Furthermore, the control system 20 is coupled to a measuring device 70 that is configured to sense and measure quantum states of the array of qubits 30 after the sequence of quantum operations have been applied to the array of qubits 30. The measuring device 70 may generate measurement data 80 comprising the outcomes of quantum measurements performed on processed qubits. In some cases, the control system 20 may receive the measurement data and send control signals to the configuration device 50 and the process control device 60, for example, to configure the array of qubits 30 and a quantum circuit 120 for a next quantum processing step (e.g., a step of an iterative computational process). In some embodiments, the control system 20, the configuration device 50, and the process control device 60 are included in a classical computing system. In some embodiments, the quantum computing system 10 can be an example of the quantum computing system 100 where the control system 20, is included in the classical computing system 110 and the array of qubits 30, the quantum circuit 120, and the measuring device 70 are included in the quantum computer 130. In some such embodiments, the configuration device 50 and the process control device 60 may be included in the quantum computer 130 or the classical computing system 110.",
                                "In the quantum computing system 10, information is represented by the array of qubits 30. A characteristic of the given qubit 40 is that it is destroyed as a measurement of its state is made using the measuring device 70. The array of qubits 30 are thus represented by the smallest unit of information storage that is feasible in the quantum computing system 10, for example each qubit is represented by a single photon or a single ion. When data is represented by qubits of such small magnitude in the quantum computing system 10, the quantum computing system 10 (e.g., the array of qubits 30, the quantum circuit 120) becomes vulnerable to external sources of noise and interference, as well as sources of noise that are internal to the quantum computer system 10 (e.g. pulse cross-talk, ZZ crosstalk between qubits and so forth). In order to reduce such sources of noise from adversely affecting operation of the quantum computing system 10, it is contemporary practice to cool the array of qubits 30, the quantum circuit 120, and the measuring device 70, to temperatures approaching an absolute zero temperature, namely 0 Kelvin, namely \u2212273.15\u00b0 C. Such low temperatures reduce, for example, a magnitude of thermal noise sources within the quantum computing system 10. Noise artefacts in the array of qubits 30 can also arise when the quantum computing system 10 is in operation on account of residual signalling (namely, crosstalk) between qubits; such residual signalling can be a function of the sequence of quantum operations that is applied to the array of qubits 30.",
                                "The quantum computing system 10, when implemented in a contemporary manner as a noisy intermediate scale quantum computing system (NISQ computer), has in an order of 50 qubits, although larger quantum computing systems including 1000 qubits or more are envisaged to become available within the next 5 to 10 years. As aforementioned, the array of qubits 30 are then optionally implemented as ion traps, superconducting Josephson junction devices or similar. Each qubit is configured in operation to have a quantum state between |0> and |1>.",
                                "Next, a method for using the quantum computing system 10 to execute a quantum computation will be described in overview with reference to FIG. 3. In a first step of executing the quantum computation on the array of qubits 10, initial values are assigned to the qubits of the array of qubits 30. In some cases, the initial values may be extracted from the input data 101. In some embodiments, such initial assignment of values is achieved by using, for example, an Ansatz that is generated using a Hamiltonian via operation of the configuration device 50. In some cases, the Hamiltonian may be determined based at least in part on the input data 101, the data stored in a memory of the control unit 20, or data received from user via a user interface of the quantum computing system 10. In a second step, a sequence of operations is executed on the array of qubits 30, wherein the operations can include interactions such as C-NOT gates, Hadamard transforms, rotations, entanglements and so forth, wherein executions of the operations are shown in respect of a temporal abscissa axis 45 in FIG. 3, namely from left to right, and wherein the qubits are represented by horizontal lines from left to right in FIG. 3, for example a line 35. The operations are, for example, executed on the qubits temporally in parallel. In a third step, when the sequence of operations has been completed, values of the array of qubits 30 are then read (measured) during a measurement phase using the measuring device 70. The number of operations in the sequence is referred to a \u201cdepth\u201d of a quantum circuit represented by FIG. 3, indicated generally by 120. As the depth of the of the quantum circuit 120 increases, there is risk of decoherence of the array of qubits 30 as well as errors occurring that are manifest as quantum noise. The quantum noise therefore determines a limit to a complexity of quantum algorithm (e.g., a number of quantum operation in a sequence of quantum operations of the quantum algorithm) that can be executed in the quantum computing system 10 on its array of qubits 30.",
                                "It will be appreciated that, in some cases, data representative of a given real physical system, for example sensor signals provided from a plurality of sensors coupled to the given real physical system to be monitored or characterized, can be processed to form to the aforesaid Ansatz to set initial states of the array of qubits 30, and the quantum circuit 120 can then be used to process the Ansatz to generate processed results representative of the given real physical system; the results are measured using the measuring device 70. The quantum circuit 120, for example, can be configured to perform special types of signal processing, for example to compute minimum energy states of the real physical system that provides insights, for example, into the stability of the real physical system, for example for safety purposes or optimal control purposes.",
                                "Some aspects of the present disclosure are concerned with measurements implemented at the measuring device 70. Whereas quantum errors accumulate in the array of qubits 30 as quantum operation are performed upon them, further noise can arise within the measuring device 70. At least part of the technical problem addressed by the disclosed systems and methods is to reduce a magnitude of the accumulated quantum errors and the further noise arising in the measuring device 70.",
                                "It will be appreciated that earlier methods involving techniques to reduce stochastic noise in sensed data representative of real physical systems have had patent rights granted in respect thereof; for example, reference is made to a granted United Kingdom patent GB2559437B, \u201cPrenatal screening and diagnostic system and method\u201d, (Applicant: Congenica Ltd.), wherein PCR genetic readout data generated using known PCR genetic readout apparatus is subject to mathematical operations to reduce stochastic noise in the readout data. In the case of this granted patent, stochastic noise reduction in sensed data was regarded by the UKIPO as being a technical effect and acceptable for patentability pursuant to section 1(2) Patents Act 1977.",
                                "In overview, referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, there is shown the quantum circuit 120 of the quantum computing system 10. The measuring device 70 is configured to measure states of the array of qubits 30 after the sequence of operations has been executed thereupon, for example by making single measurements, alternatively a plurality of measurements and then processing to try to reduce quantum noise in determinations of the states of the array of qubits 30.",
                                "In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the quantum noise generation during a quantum computational process may be controlled by reducing a maximum depth of the quantum circuits used for completing the quantum computational process to generate results having an error below a threshold error. In some examples, a series of quantum operations associated with the quantum computational process may be divided into a plurality of sequences of quantum operations, and the quantum state of the array of qubits 30 may be approximated (e.g., a variation method) after each sequence of the quantum operations. In some cases, where each sequence comprises a maximum likelihood amplitude estimation (MLAE) and the quantum state of the array of qubits is approximated using a variational approach, the corresponding quantum computational method may be referred to as Variational Quantum Amplitude Estimation (VQAE). In some examples, at least to sequence of the plurality of sequences of quantum operations may comprise the same number of quantum operations, or the same circuit depth. As such, in some cases, a circuit depth of the quantum circuit used for performing Variational Quantum Amplitude Estimation (VQAE) and generating results having an error below a threshold error, may be constant and independent of the threshold error. VQAE may enable performing certain quantum computational tasks on a NISQ computer.",
                                "It is contemporary known practice to use Monte Carlo (MC) estimation of the states of the array of qubits 30. In embodiments of the present disclosure, it is beneficial that the measuring device 70 in combination with the array of qubits 30 is implemented in a particular advantageous configuration, as will next be elucidated.",
                                "The measuring device 70 is beneficially configured to implement quantum amplitude estimation (QAE); in other words, with learning and by using fixed depth quantum circuit arrangements, it is feasible to implement quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) on a NISQ computer. In embodiments of the present disclosure, it is feasible to extend a speed-up of QAE to at least a further order of magnitude in precision of estimation values of the array of qubits 30 compared to other, non-variational approaches to determining the states of the array of qubits 30 after the aforesaid of quantum operations have been executed.",
                                "In embodiments of the present disclosure, exponential noise accumulation in the array of cubits 30 of the quantum computing system 10 is suppressed; in general, the exponential noise accumulation increases in magnitude as the depth of the quantum circuit 120 is increased. Embodiments of the present disclosure beneficially use fixed-depth quantum circuits that have a fixed depth, wherein the fixed-depth quantum circuits can be fine-tuned based on characteristics of quantum hardware of the quantum computing system 10. Thus, it is feasible to implement optimal hardware operations in the quantum computing system 10 that are susceptible to achieve a full theoretical speed-up when executing operations on the array of qubits 30; such a benefit of achieved by learning parameters of quantum gates that are applied to the array of qubits 30, despite sub-optimal quantum hardware control that may arise during operation of the control system 20.",
                                "In embodiments of the present disclosure, a level of quantum noise arising in quantum hardware of the quantum computing system 10 during a computational task (e.g., quantum amplitude estimation or amplification) may be reduced by using computational steps that allow performing the computational task while maintaining the depth of the corresponding quantum circuits constant. Moreover, in the embodiments, there is used a learning strategy that mitigates sub-optimal qubit control, wherein quantum noise otherwise grows exponentially as function of quantum circuit depth, wherein the quantum noise can potentially cause decoherence of the array of qubits 30, namely potentially a complete loss of quantum properties of the array of qubits 30. Furthermore, embodiments of the present disclosure improve sub-optimal control arising from operation of the control system 20 that would otherwise reduce a speed-up that is feasible based on theoretical noise limits.",
                                "It will be appreciated that, in embodiments of the present disclosure, input data 101 may comprise data generated by sensors that is representative of one or more real physical systems; for example, the input data 101 can be:\n\n\n- - (i) satellite data of captured images of the Earth's surface;\n  - (ii) aircraft movement data;\n  - (iii) projectile movement data when the quantum computing system\n    **10** is included as part of a military defence system,\n  - and so forth.",
                                "However, in embodiments of the present disclosure, it will be appreciated that the quantum computing system 10 is also susceptible to being used in use applications of a more abstract nature (that may be susceptible to patent protection in the USA pursuant to 35 USC 101), such as:\n\n\n- - (i) machine learning, for example for training generative models for\n    simulating real physical systems;\n  - (ii) in finance, for performing risk estimation, for pricing\n    portfolios, for performing value adjustments; and\n  - (iii) for performing quantum chemistry simulations, for example for\n    estimating observables in quantum simulations.",
                                "Embodiments of the present disclosure, when applied to the hardware of the quantum computing system 10, beneficially use adaptive variational quantum amplitude estimation (AVQAE) that is a special case of variational quantum amplitude estimation (VQAE). Optionally, the AVQAE makes use of a rescaling algorithm, that potentially provides an order of magnitude reduction in the variation cost of the VQAE, e.g., by rescaling a real valued function whose expectation value has to be determined by the quantum amplitude estimation.",
                                "Moreover, embodiments of the present disclosure may reduce quantum noise associated with a quantum computational task (e.g., quantum amplitude estimation) most effectively when the quantum computing system 10 is implemented as an ion-trap quantum computing system, for example as manufactured by Honeywell, that benefits from a high connectively between qubits of the array of qubits 30. Furthermore, such an ion-trap quantum computing system allows deeper quantum circuits (e.g., quantum circuits associated with a sequence of VQAE) to be used before running an optimisation or approximation step; such a manner of use potentially enables the quantum noise reduction to be improved a further order of magnitude in comparison to the quantum computing system 10 implemented in a known contemporary manner However, embodiments of the present disclosure can be used with other type of quantum computing systems, for example superconducting Josephson junction quantum computing systems as manufactured by IBM Corp. USA.",
                                "Next, a further description for VQAE and AVQAE will be provided. Variational quantum amplitude estimation (VQAE) is a combination of two concepts: firstly, an original quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm and, secondly, a variational quantum algorithmic (VQA) method. The original QAE algorithm is susceptible to providing an advantage of a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. However, this quantum algorithm has quantum hardware requirements that exceed capabilities of current NISQ computers. The VQA approach has established itself as a powerful set of tools to make the most of current quantum devices. In the present disclosure, an aim of synergistically combining QAE and VQA is to obtain a quantum algorithm for current NISQ computing technologies that achieves a quantum advantage over MC sampling.",
                                "To make the most of current NISQ computers, the noise arising when executing quantum calculations should be reduced. To this end, VQAE starts from the aforesaid original QAE algorithm and, firstly, replaces the deep and noisy quantum circuits used for the quantum Fourier transform by a classical inference procedure based on maximum likelihood estimation. Then, VQAE iterates the following two steps:\n\n\n- - (1) a first step of applying a finite number of Grover iterations,\n    during which the depth of the quantum circuit **120** and its\n    associated noise grows, to estimate an amplitude of the noise; and\n  - (2) a step of performing a variational optimization to reduce the\n    circuit depth and noise of the quantum circuit **120**.",
                                "The number of Grover iterations in the step (1) is chosen to be as large as possible according to a noise resilience of the available quantum hardware of the quantum computing system 10. Moreover, the step (2) replaces the deep and noisy circuit obtained after several Grover iterations by a more compact and less noisy circuit that represents a same quantum state of the circuit.",
                                "Adaptive VQAE (AVQAE) is a special, improved case of VQAE that has reduced computational requirements when executed on the quantum computing system 10. A naive VQAE implementation has a computational cost that exceeds a computation cost of a corresponding classical MC calculation. Such an increased computational cost arises due to the VQA part in VQAE; in other words, it is a cost of implementing the variational optimization. To reduce this cost, AVQAE adapts the problem and rescales the amplitude to be estimated. Then, variational optimization only needs to correct the current quantum state for a small deviation from the previous state. Such an approach can significantly reduce the computational cost, below the one of classical MC sampling, so that AVQAE can obtain a quantum advantage more easily than a naive VQAE realization.",
                                "After having completed the step (1) and (2) of VQAE or AVQAE, there is thereby obtained an empirical estimation of the expectation value that goes beyond what hardware noise allows standard QAE and with the same polynomial quantum advantage. The steps (1) and (2) can be repeated multiple times, namely in an iterative manner, for further refining the expected value estimation with quantum advantage. A more detailed description of operation of VQAE and AVQAE are described below.",
                                "Whereas quantum computing systems use Monte Carlo amplitude estimation when implementing the aforesaid measuring device 70 to determine states of the array of qubits 30 after executing of the quantum circuit 120 in the quantum computing system 10, the quantum computing system 10, when implemented pursuant to the present disclosure, implements a VQAE in the quantum circuit 120, wherein the VQAE is based on a maximum likelihood framework as proposed in reference with a linearly incremental sequence of iterations {m=1, 2, 3, . . . , M}, wherein m is an integer representative of iteration number and M is a maximum number of iterations. Such a framework has an advantage that the depth of the quantum circuit 120 used for m-time application of applying a quantum operator (e.g., the Grover operator Q) increases linearly with an increase in the integer m. However, to prevent the circuit depth of the quantum circuit 120 increasing indefinitely, there is included, as an innovation, a variational step during which a quantum state resulted from M application of the quantum operator (e.g., QM) of a depth of the order k is approximated by a quantum state of a constant depth smaller than M. Beneficially, the variational approximation is performed every k-th power of Q where 0<k<M. For all other iterations, a corresponding power of Q (i.e., Qk) may be applied to a variational quantum state (also referred to as variational state).",
                                "By configuring the quantum circuit 120 to implement VQAE therein to assist with determining states of the array of qubits 30 when measured using the measuring device 70, the state of the array of qubits 30 can be determined with less quantum noise. Often, the noise reduction can be an order of magnitude in comparison to Monte Carlo amplitude estimation.",
                                "In embodiments of the present disclosure, the quantum computing system 10 configured to implement VQAE can be further improved to reduce quantum noise arising therein by using adaptive variational quantum amplitude estimation (AVQAE); such AVQAE makes use of adaptive rescaling that is commonly used in Monte Carlo simulations [see reference 42], but has not hitherto been used for quantum noise reduction in the quantum computing system 10.",
                                "By using the AVQAE, it is feasible to configure the quantum circuit 120 in combination to using the measuring device 70 so that the sequence of quantum operations applied to the array of qubits 30 generates qubit output results from the measuring device 70 that are less noisy in respect of quantum noise in comparison to merely using known Monte Carlo amplitude estimation to implement the measuring device 70. By making the VQAE adaptive, up to an order of magnitude mitigation in quantum noise generated in the quantum computing system 10 can be feasible to comparison merely to using VQAE. VQAE is capable of providing up to an order of magnitude reduction in quantum noise relative to using known Monte Carlo amplitude estimation.",

In some cases, a series of squares in a row may represent a quantum state of one or more qubits (e.g., the quantum state of the array of qubits 30). The red (or darker) square may represent an initial quantum state (e.g., associated with an Ansatz), and the states that include the red (or darker) square and several grey (or lighter) squares may represent the quantum states of processed qubits, where a quantum state may be a result of a quantum operation (e.g., an operation comprising application of one or more Grover operators or Qs) on a previous state. The number of grey (lighter) squares in a state represent a number a quantum operation performed on the initial state to generate the corresponding state. Each step of the amplitude estimation process 400 may comprise performing a quantum operation on a previous state according to MLAE resulting in a linear incremental sequence of iterations as described above.",

Next, the resulting variational state may be used as the initial state for applying the next sequence of operators (e.g., k sequential application of the query operator).

                                "Below we numerically show that in the context of Monte Carlo integration, shallow circuits can accurately approximate many amplitude amplification steps. We combine the variational approach with maximum likelihood amplitude in the context of Monte Carlo integration, estimation [Y. Suzuki et al., Quantum Inf. Process. 19, 75 (2020)] in variational quantum amplitude estimation (VQAE). VQAE can exhibit a cubic quantum speedup over classical Monte Carlo (MC) sampling if the variational cost is ignored. If this cost is taken into account, VQAE typically has larger computational requirements than classical MC sampling. To reduce the variational cost, we propose adaptive VQAE and numerically show that it can outperform classical MC sampling.",
                                "Amplitude estimation [1] is a powerful algorithm that can achieve a quadratic quantum speedup over classical Monte Carlo (MC) methods [2]. It has a wide range of applications, e.g., in quantum chemistry [3, 4], machine learning [5-7], and finance [8-10] where it can help with tasks such as risk analysis [11, 12] and the pricing of financial derivatives [13, 14]. The original amplitude estimation procedure [1] has hardware requirements that are challenging for current quantum devices and, therefore, reducing these requirements is currently an active area of research. Important breakthroughs were obtained in recent proposals which succeeded in replacing the hardware-intensive components of traditional amplitude estimation\u2014controlled multi-qubit gates and quantum Fourier transform\u2014by classical post-processing [15-18]. Alternatively, one can systematically reduce the circuit depth by interpolating between classical MC methods and amplitude estimation [19]. Additionally, classical pre-processing can replace costly quantum arithmetic [20].",
                                "Here, in the present disclosure, there is addressed the question whether the quantum computational requirements for amplitude estimation can be further decreased by making use of variational quantum algorithms [21-23]. Moreover, in the following, there is presented variational quantum amplitude estimation (VQAE) in which the depth of the entire quantum circuit is kept below a desired maximum value by means of variational optimization. VQAE is based on maximum likelihood amplitude estimation (MLAE) [15]. Moreover, there is also presented a na\u00efve and an adaptive VQAE algorithm. Adaptive VQAE rescales the amplitude to reduce the cost of the variational optimization. The advantage of VQAE over MLAE is that the maximum circuit depth of VQAE is independent of the total number of MLAE steps, whereas in MLAE this depth grows linearly with the number of MLAE steps. The advantage of VQAE over classical MC sampling is that VQAE can have a lower computational cost.",
                                "In FIG. 6, there is shown an amplitude estimation error \u03b4\u03b8 as a function of the computational cost, i.e., the number of queries Nq. It is beneficial to compare adaptive VQAE (symbols with lines guide to the eye) to MLAE (dashed orange) 604 and classical MC sampling (dotted blue) 602. There is calculated the rescaled mean value of a shifted Lorentzian (red circles), Gaussian (green triangles), and log-normal (purple squares) probability distribution. In VQAE, the first ten (10) amplitude estimates are computed via MLAE, then one step of the variational optimization 606 is performed, which is followed by the next iteration of ten (10) MLAE steps. This procedure of variational approximation followed by MLAE is repeated three more times, resulting in a final error \u03b4\u03b8\u22486\u00b710\u22125. It will be appreciated that, for this error, Nq is up to an order of magnitude smaller in VQAE than in classical MC sampling. Throughout this calculation, VQAE's circuit depth may not exceed the depth of the initial state plus ten (10) times the depth of the query operator, whereas MLAE's circuits have the depth of the initial state plus, at the end, fifty (50) times the depth of the query operator. In FIG. 6, there is shown that, for the problems considered here, VQAE outperforms classical MC sampling and additionally keeps the overall circuit depth below a fixed value.",

It will be appreciated that this scaling is cubically better than the one of classical MC sampling. The second convergence regime is observed for larger values of M. In this regime, the error follows the MC scaling with \u03b4\u03b8\u02dc(Nq\u22121/2). One can understand this new scaling in terms of a one-dimensional classical random walk with an average step of length 2\u03b8 and some finite variance induced by variational approximations.

                                "It is anticipated that the efficiency of the VQAE algorithm can be further increased. Firstly, optionally, a local cost function\u2014which can help mitigate the negative effect of barren plateaus [49]\u2014improves the variational optimization and reduces the required number of variational queries. Secondly, the performance of our variational algorithm uses the maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Optionally, alternative approaches perform better, e.g., iterative QAE [18] or QoPrime AE [19]."
