    "abstract": "We propose to perform amplitude estimation with the help of constant-depth quantum circuits that variationally approximate states during amplitude amplification. In the context of Monte Carlo (MC) integration, we numerically show that shallow circuits can accurately approximate many amplitude amplification steps. We combine the variational approach with maximum likelihood amplitude estimation [Y. Suzuki et al., Quantum Inf. Process. 19, 75 (2020)] in variational quantum amplitude estimation (VQAE). VQAE typically has larger computational requirements than classical MC sampling. To reduce the variational cost, we propose adaptive VQAE and numerically show in 6 to 12 qubit simulations that it can outperform classical MC sampling.",

                "Amplitude estimation [1] is a powerful algorithm that can achieve a quadratic quantum speedup over classical Monte Carlo (MC) methods [2]. It has a wide range of applications, e.g. in quantum chemistry [3,4], machine learning [5][6][7], and finance [8][9][10] where it can help with tasks such as risk analysis [11,12] and the pricing of financial derivatives [13,14].",
                "The original amplitude estimation procedure [1] has hardware requirements that are challenging for current quantum devices and, therefore, reducing these requirements is currently an active area of research. Crucial breakthroughs were obtained in recent proposals which succeeded in replacing the hardwareintensive components of traditional amplitude estimation -controlled multi-qubit gates and quantum Fourier transform -by classical post-processing [15][16][17][18]. Alternatively, one can systematically reduce the circuit depth by interpolating between classical MC methods and amplitude estimation [19]. Additionally, classical pre-processing can replace costly quantum arithmetic [20] and Bayesian inference can be used to boost the algorithmic efficiency in the presence of device errors [21,22].",
                "In this article, we address the question whether the quantum computational requirements for amplitude estimation can be further decreased by making use of Kirill Plekhanov: kirill.plekhanov@cambridgequantum.com Figure 1: Amplitude estimation error \u03b4\u03b8 as a function of the computational cost, i.e. the number of queries Nq. We compare adaptive VQAE (symbols with lines guide to the eye) to MLAE (dashed orange) and classical MC sampling (dotted blue). We calculate the rescaled mean value of a shifted Cauchy-Lorentz (red circles), Gaussian (green triangles), and log-normal (purple squares) probability distribution. In VQAE, the first 10 amplitude estimates are computed via MLAE, then one step of the variational optimization is performed, which is followed by the next iteration of 10 MLAE steps. This procedure of variational approximation followed by MLAE is repeated three more times, resulting in a final error \u03b4\u03b8 \u2248 6 \u2022 10 -5 . We see that, for this error, Nq is up to an order of magnitude smaller in VQAE than in classical MC sampling. Throughout this calculation, VQAE's circuit depth is the depth of the initial state plus at most 10 times the depth of the query operator, whereas MLAE's circuits have the depth of the initial state plus, at the end, 50 times the depth of the query operator.",
                "variational quantum algorithms [23][24][25]. We present variational quantum amplitude estimation (VQAE) in which the depth of the entire quantum circuit is always kept below a desired maximum value by means of variational optimization. VQAE is based on maximum likelihood amplitude estimation (MLAE) [15]. We present a na\u00efve and an adaptive VQAE algorithm. Adaptive VQAE rescales the amplitude to reduce the cost of the variational optimization. The advantage of VQAE over MLAE is that the maximum circuit depth of VQAE is independent of the total number of MLAE steps, whereas in MLAE this depth grows linearly with the number of MLAE steps. The advantage of VQAE over classical MC sampling is that VQAE can have a lower computational cost. Figure 1 shows that, for the problems considered here, VQAE outperforms classical MC sampling and additionally keeps the overall circuit depth below a fixed value.",

Firstly, in Section 2, we define the problems considered here and explain the original quantum algorithm for amplitude estimation as well as the classical MC approach. Then, in Section 3 we present our variational methods, study variational errors of constant-depth quantum circuits, and develop na\u00efve and adaptive VQAE. We conclude this article and discuss potential next steps in Section 4."

For an exponential schedule {m = 1, 2, 4, . . . , 2 M }, this algorithm has the query cost N q \u223c O(1/ ). A linear schedule {m = 1, 2, 3, . . . , M } increases the query cost to N q \u223c O( -4/3 ). Note that in this case N q scales quadratically with the maximum circuit depth M . Following the same idea of reducing the hardware requirements, the authors of Ref. [19] present two algorithms with computational cost N q \u223c O(1/ \u03b2+1 ) for quantum circuits of reduced depth O(1/ 1-\u03b2 ). These algorithms are controlled by an external parameter \u03b2 which allows one to interpolate between the quantum regime at \u03b2 = 0 and the classical MC regime at \u03b2 = 1."

In this regime, the error follows the MC scaling with \u03b4\u03b8 \u223c O(N -1/2 q ). To understand this behaviour, we first notice that the MLAE error decreases with M , while the variational error increases instead. In the regime when the MLAE error is larger than the variational error, the scaling of \u03b4\u03b8 is the best achievable MLAE scaling \u03b4\u03b8 \u223c O(N",

After M steps of the algorithm, M/k = M (as k = 1 here) variational approximations were performed resulting in a final error of variance M \u03c3 2 .

To estimate the cost of a single variational update, we write down the number of circuits needed to be run for each variational update as N var/1 = 2n f n s n p where n p is the number of parameters of a PQC, n s is the total number of sweeps through all the parameters of the PQC, and n f is the number of Bernoulli trials per evaluation of the objective function. The factor 2 comes from the fact that two evaluations of the objective function are required for each evaluation of the gradient in Eq. (18). For the PQC in Fig. 2 with d = 4, the number of parameters is n p = 60. Additionally, we choose n f \u223c n s \u223c 100 so that N var/1 \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10 6 and N var \u223c 4.8 \u00d7 10 6 M . This large variational cost is the dominant part in the calculation of the total number of queries N q . Ultimately, it leads to a performance of na\u00efve VQAE that is worse than the one of classical MC sampling. Reducing any of n f , n s , or n p decreases the variational cost but also increases the variational error which then leads to a worse final amplitude estimation error. We see that the infidelity decreases with increasing d, due to the corresponding increase of the expressive power of the PQC. The infidelity increases linearly as a function of m slowly with a slope of \u2248 0.00017 that is approximately the same for the three distributions. These results are obtained via na\u00efve VQAE with k = 1, M = 50, and ns = 1000, using the numerically exact gradient without sampling and Adam with the initial learning rate \u03b2 = 0.1.

                        "To reduce the variational cost of VQAE, in the following we present the adaptive VQAE algorithm. In this algorithm, the function f is rescaled such that the k-th power of the Grover operator is close to the identity and only then the variational optimization is carried out. Then the PQC ansatz needs to be just slightly different from the initial state |\u03c6 init and the optimization needs fewer samples than na\u00efve VQAE.",
                        "To introduce the adaptive VQAE algorithm, we first note that the amplitude a = E p [f ] -see Eq. (1) -is linear in f , meaning that rescaling the function f with a proportionality constant r also rescales the amplitude a:",
                        "The rescaled function f can then be used to encode a new quantum state |\u03c7 0 n+1 and a new Grover operator Q , provided that 0 \u2264 f (x) \u2264 1 for all x, which is required for the successful state preparation via Eq. (7). Restricted by this constraint, the rescaling factor has to satisfy 0 \u2264 rf (x) \u2264 1 for all x.",
                        "To proceed further, we make the observation that the new Grover operator Q implements a rotation by an angle 2\u03b8 in the subspace H \u03c7 spanned by good and bad renormalized states, as shown in Eq. (9). Under the commensurability condition",
                        "applying the renormalized Grover operator Q k results in performing l full rotations in H \u03c7 . Such a commensurability condition can be achieved by fixing the renormalization factor as",
                        "where \u03b8 is uniquely determined by the choice of the desired power k and some integer number l. Hence, we conclude that for a proper choice of r satisfying 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1/ max x f (x), it is possible to rescale the function f so that the k-th power of the corresponding Grover operator acts as identity in the subspace of good and bad states, i.e. Q k = I \u03c7 in theory.",
                        "In practice, however, looking at Eq. (25) we see that finding the exact renormalization factor r requires exact knowledge of the initial amplitude a which, of course, we do not have. However, as we show in the following, a loose estimate a l , obtained from a moderate number of MC samples of the initial state |\u03c7 0 n+1 , is sufficient to get Q k \u2248 I \u03c7 and use it in adaptive VQAE. Assuming that such a loose amplitude estimate is provided, a loose renormalization factor can then be expressed as r l = a /a l , with a defined as in Eq. (24). Because of this imprecise estimation, the actual value of the amplitude after rescaling becomes a l = sin 2 (\u03b8 l ) = r l a and the Grover operator performs l full rotations only approximately, i.e. the previous exact identity transforms into Q k \u2248 I \u03c7 with a typical phase error per Grover rotation of",
                        "For an unbiased loose estimate with zero average, \u03b4\u03b8 can be interpreted as a random error of zero mean.",
                        "After k Grover rotations, this error becomes k times as large.",
                        "Next, we use the VQAE algorithm to estimate the amplitude a l by means of the Grover operator Q and the initial state |\u03c7 0 n+1 . The variational approximation is performed at every k-th step, when the overlap",
                        "is expected to be the largest. Here we use that \u03b8 l + \u03b4\u03b8 = \u03b8 = \u03c0l/k. Additionally, we assume that the PQC has the initial state |\u03c6 init n+1 = |\u03c7 0 n+1 so that the variational quantum state of Eq. ( 16) reads",
                        "Having the PQC initialized to the identity at the beginning of each optimization step, the only role of the variational quantum circuit is to correct the deviation of Eq. ( 26) originating from an imprecise value of the renormalization constant r l and to bring the overlap of Eq. ( 27) as close to one as possible. As a consequence, the variational optimization always starts from a good solution and therefore, in general, converges quicker to a better solution than na\u00efve VQAE. This leads to a significant reduction in variational cost of adaptive VQAE compared to the na\u00efve version of the algorithm. Finally, at the end of the calculation, a maximum likelihood estimation of a l = sin 2 (\u03b8 l ) = r l a is obtained. To go back to the original formulation of the problem and compare the results, we use the inverse transformation",
                        "where the renormalization constant r l has to be exactly the same as the one used for the function rescaling in order for the prior and posterior rescaling errors to cancel out. This last step concludes the adaptive VQAE algorithm which is summarized in terms of pseudocode as Algorithm 2. We analyze the performance of the adaptive VQAE algorithm with a simplified variational ansatz consisting of only six single-qubit rotation gates and four CNOT gates, as shown in Fig. 2 in dark blue color. This simplified ansatz has only six parameters in total, which significantly reduces the number of variational queries as well as the effects of the noise due to finite sampling. We determine the loose estimate of the amplitude a l via 5 \u00d7 10 5 MC samples. As a result, much smaller values of infidelity are achieved for n f being an order of magnitude smaller than in our na\u00efve VQAE computations. We also note that for smaller values of a, the initial MC estimation of a gets worse and, as a consequence, more sweeps are required to ensure the convergence of the variational ansatz.",
                        "Our results for adaptive VQAE are presented in Fig. 1, where we show the convergence of \u03b4\u03b8 as a function of N q for k = 10. The simulations use Adam with the initial learning rate \u03b2 = 10 -3 , n f = 100, n s = 100, and n p = 6, resulting in N var/1 = 2n f n s n p = 1.2 \u00d7 10 5 . As in Fig. 4 ). The major difference of the adaptive VQAE as compared to all previously studied methods is a large starting cost which corresponds to the amount of MC samples required for the evaluation of a l . This starting cost, however, represents only an additive contribution to N q and, hence, is insignificant in the regime of our interest when the number of queries gets large. Additionally, we find that, thanks to a significant improvement of the number of query calls and the overall precision of the variational state, the resulting final error \u03b4\u03b8 of the adaptive VQAE algorithm surpasses the classical MC error.",
                        "Interestingly, we observe that in the regime of small k, the performance of the adaptive VQAE algorithm decreases. This has several reasons. Firstly, the precision of the maximum likelihood estimation decreases when the angle \u03b8 = \u03c0l/k (where l = 1 in our case) becomes larger than \u03c0/4, i.e. for k \u2264 4. Hence, to perform an estimation with such small values of k, a different statistical inference technique has to be considered. Secondly, for small values of k, the rescaling factor can become much larger than one and then leads to more efficient classical MC sampling. Therefore, in calculations with C = 0.1 classical MC sampling performs better than adaptive VQAE for k \u2264 5, corresponding to r 7.508.",
                        "To understand how adaptive VQAE performs for increasing qubit counts n, we have run the same simulations as in Fig. 1 for n = 8, 10, and 12. The results for the Gaussian probability distribution are shown in Fig. 5. For the shifted Cauchy-Lorentz and lognormal probability distributions we obtained results (not shown) lying on top of the ones in Fig. 5. We find no significant dependence on n in any of our results. This is surprising as the cost function Eq. ( 14) is global and therefore the vanishing gradient problem [44] should lead to worse results for larger values of n. We conjecture that the equally good performance of adaptive VQAE for all considered values of n is due to the simple variational ansatz as well as the specific problems studied here. Adaptive VQAE uses the simple ansatz shown in Fig. 2 that consists of only 6 variational angles independent of n. Additionally, the ansatz is composed of nearest-neighbour CNOTs and single-qubit R y rotation gates, i.e. not exact local 2-designs as in [44]. The problems studied here are expectation value calculations where an increased qubit count n leads to an increased number of grid points 2 n for the discretized approximation, see Eq. (1). For the smooth functions considered here, we anticipate that the expectation value converges rapidly with increasing number of grid points."

                "In this article, we provide numerical evidence that variational quantum algorithms based on constantdepth quantum circuits can be more efficient than classical MC sampling in the context of amplitude estimation. The quantum circuits used for our numerical demonstrations, however, are still challenging for this generation of gate-based quantum computers. Therefore, an exciting next step is to find other problems and applications for which VQAE has low quantum hardware requirements and can be realized on actual quantum devices.",
                "We can imagine future applications for VQAE in several areas, including combinatorial optimization, quantum machine learning, and quantum chemistry. In the context of combinatorial optimization, VQAE enables us to use constant-depth quantum circuits to carry out Grover search, which can find the opti- mal solution with a quadratic quantum speedup over brute-force search. Here it is also enticing to study whether such a variational Grover search algorithm can benefit from filtering operators [45]. In relation to quantum machine learning, VQAE has the potential to make it possible for current quantum devices to accelerate inference in Bayesian networks [46], which can then be compared with state-of-the-art variational quantum algorithms for inference [47]. With regards to quantum chemistry, the concept of VQAE can be combined with variational quantum phase estimation (VQPE) [48][49][50] to realize VQPE with shallow circuits on actual quantum hardware. In this context, one interesting application is to use accurate quantum chemistry results obtained with a quantum computer to train an ansatz for the exchange-correlation energy in density functional theory by means of machine learning [51][52][53].",
                "We anticipate that the efficiency of the VQAE algorithm can be further increased. Firstly, it would be interesting to analyse whether a local cost function exists -which can help mitigate the negative effect of barren plateaus [44] -that improves the variational optimization and reduces the required number of variational queries. Secondly, the performance of our variational algorithm crucially depends on the maximum likelihood estimation procedure. It would be interesting to investigate whether alternative approaches perform better, e.g. iterative QAE [18] or QoPrime AE [19]."
