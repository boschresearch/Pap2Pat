    "title": "Transepithelial Transport of Fc-Targeted Nanoparticles by the Neonatal Fc Receptor for Oral Delivery",
    "date": "2013-11-27",
    "abstract": "Nanoparticles are poised to have a tremendous impact on the treatment of many diseases, but their broad application is limited because currently they can only be administered by parenteral methods. Oral administration of nanoparticles is preferred but remains a challenge because transport across the intestinal epithelium is limited. We show that nanoparticles targeted to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which mediates the transport of immunoglobulin G antibodies across epithelial barriers, are efficiently transported across the intestinal epithelium using both in vitro and in vivo models. In mice, orally administered FcRn-targeted nanoparticles crossed the intestinal epithelium and reached systemic circulation with a mean absorption efficiency of 13.7%*hour compared with only 1.2%*hour for nontargeted nanoparticles. In addition, targeted nanoparticles containing insulin as a model nanoparticle-based therapy for diabetes were orally administered at a clinically relevant insulin dose of 1.1 U/kg and elicited a prolonged hypoglycemic response in wild-type mice. This effect was abolished in FcRn knockout mice, indicating that the enhanced nanoparticle transport was specifically due to FcRn. FcRn-targeted nanoparticles may have a major impact on the treatment of many diseases by enabling drugs currently limited by low bioavailability to be efficiently delivered though oral administration.",

                "Nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to make a significant impact on the treatment of many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Many NP-based therapeutics are now entering clinical trials or have been approved for use (1,2), including targeted polymeric nanoparticles ((3), clinical trial NCT01478893) based on technologies that we have previously described (4). However, the impact of NPs in the clinic may be limited to a narrow set of indications because NP administration is currently restricted to parenteral methods. Many diseases that could benefit from NP-based therapeutics require frequent administration. Alternate routes of administration, particularly oral, are preferred because of the convenience and compliance by patients (5). Intestinal absorption of NPs is highly inefficient because the physicochemical parameters of NPs prevent their transport across cellular barriers such as the intestinal epithelium (6). To improve the absorption efficiency of NPs and to make the oral administration of NPs practical in the clinic, new strategies are necessary to overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier.",
                "The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) mediates IgG transport across polarized epithelial barriers (7,8). It was discovered as the receptor in the neonatal intestine that transports IgG in breast milk from mother to offspring (9). However, FcRn is expressed into adulthood at levels similar to fetal expression in the apical region of epithelial cells in the small intestine and diffusely throughout the colon (10). FcRn is also expressed in the vascular endothelium, blood-brain barrier, kidneys, liver, lungs, and throughout the hematopoietic system (11,12). FcRn interacts with the Fc portion of IgG in a pH-dependent manner, binding with high affinity in acidic (pH <6.5) but not physiological environments (pH ~7.4) (13). The intracellular trafficking of the IgG:FcRn complex has been conclusively demonstrated in the rat intestine using IgG Fc labeled with 1.4-nm gold as a contrast agent for electron tomography (14). The studies revealed that Fc is transported through a complex pathway involving a network of entangled tubular and irregular vesicles in order to reach the basolateral surface of the cell.",
                "We hypothesized that targeting NPs to FcRn using IgG Fc fragments would allow orally administered NPs to be transported across the intestinal epithelium in rodents (Fig. 1). In acidic sections of the intestine, such as the duodenum and portions of the jejunum (15), Fc fragments conjugated to NPs [Fc-targeted NPs (NP-Fc)] will bind to FcRn at the apical surface of absorptive epithelial cells, leading to receptor-mediated endocytosis (16). NP-Fc could also be taken up by fluid phase pinocytosis. During intracellular trafficking, NP-Fc and FcRn in the same acidic endosome compartments will bind with high affinity. FcRn can then guide bound NP-Fc through a transcytosis pathway, avoiding lysosomal degradation (17). On the basolateral side, exocytosis results in exposure to a neutral pH environment in the lamina propria, causing the release of NP-Fc (18). NP-Fc can then diffuse through the lamina propria and enter systemic circulation.",
                "Fc-fusion proteins have been used to overcome biological barriers: Fc fused with erythropoietin was measured in non-human primates (19) and humans (20) after pulmonary administration, indicating that using the FcRn is a valid transport pathway in humans; and follicle-stimulating hormone fused with Fc reached circulation after oral delivery in newborn rats (21). However, NPs offer several potential advantages over fusion proteins including (i) transport of many drug molecules with each transcytosis event; (ii) protection of drug molecules, particularly protein therapeutics, through encapsulation; and (iii) mitigation of the need for drug modification. Recently, 20-50-nm fluorescent NPs conjugated to IgG Fc were transported across an in vitro airway epithelial cell monolayer (22). Yet no studies, to our knowledge, have used drug-encapsulated NPs to target the FcRnfor oral drug delivery applications.",
                "Herein, we developed polymeric NPs surface-modified with Fc to target FcRn, resulting in transepithelial transport both in vitro and in vivo. NP-Fc demonstrated enhanced transport specifically mediated by FcRn across an intestinal epithelial monolayer in vitro. In mice, NP-Fc were imaged crossing the intestinal epithelium and entering the lamina propria after oral administration. NP-Fc were also measured in several organs after oral administration, indicating that NP-Fc were able to reach systemic circulation. Finally, NP-Fc encapsulating insulin as a model NP-based therapeutic for diabetes were administered orally and elicited a hypoglycemic response. These results demonstrate that NPs targeted to the FcRn are capable of crossing an epithelial barrier in vivo using a transcytosis pathway."

PEG is a biocompatible polymer that remains on the NP surface owing to its hydrophilic nature and forms the NP corona.

                        "Studies of NPs have shown enhanced intestinal uptake as particle size decreases (23,24). However, these previous studies on particle size have mostly focused on nonspecific uptake by M cells in the Peyer's patches as opposed to specifically targeting the NPs to a transcytosis pathway such as the FcRn-mediated pathway. Here, the nanoprecipitation selfassembly method (25)(Fig. 2A) was used to generate particles with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 55 nm and a polydispersity of 0.05 (Fig. 2B).",
                        "Polyclonal IgG Fc fragments were covalently conjugated to PEG using maleimide-thiol chemistry. 2-Iminothiolane was used to modify the Fc with thiol groups (Fc-SH). Fc-SH was incubated with NPs for conjugation (Fig. 2A). The amount of Fc conjugated to the NPs was measured for both Fc-SH and unmodified Fc (Fig. 2C). Unmodified Fc resulted in a lower ligand density than Fc-SH, indicating minimal nonspecific interactions between Fc and the NP surface and that the unbound Fc was successfully separated from NP using centrifugal filtration. The ligand density for Fc-SH was 32-fold higher than unmodified Fc, indicating that Fc was bound on the NP surface. In addition, the hydrodynamic diameter of the NP increased from 55 to 63 nm after Fc conjugation (Fig. 2B) -an increase consistent with the hydrodynamic diameter of IgG Fc (~3 nm) (26). The surface charge showed only a minor change from -4.3 \u00b1 0.4 for NP to -5.6 \u00b1 1.1 mV for NP-Fc (mean \u00b1 SD, n=3, p>0.05, Student's t test)."

Caco-2 cells endogenously express human FcRn and human beta-2-microglobulin, and have previously been used for IgG transcytosis studies (8,27). 3 H-labeled NPs were used to measure transport across the Caco-2 monolayer. Using this system with a pH gradient established from the apical to basolateral side of the Caco-2 polarized monolayer (to mimic the physiological pH of the duodenum and enhance apical binding), the transcytosis of nontargeted NPs (control) and NP-Fc was measured. 3 H measurements for NP-Fc on the basolateral side were twofold greater than non-targeted NPs after 24 h, indicating that Fc on the NP surface significantly enhanced transepithelial transport in vitro (Fig. 2D). When NP-Fc was combined with a 50-fold excess of free IgG Fc as a blocking agent for the FcRn transcytosis pathway, NP-Fc transport was significantly reduced, indicating that the enhanced transport of NP-Fc is at least partially receptor-mediated (Fig. 2D)."

Figure 3D shows representative images for both non-targeted NPs and NP-Fc. For the non-targeted NPs, the fluorescence from the NPs was not observed in the villi, suggesting that the NPs were unable to enter the villi. However, for the NP-Fc, fluorescence was observed inside the villi on the basolateral side of the epithelial cells, indicating that NP-Fc crossed the intestinal epithelium and entered the lamina propria(Fig. 3 D).",
                        "The biodistribution and absorption efficiency of both targeted and non-targeted NPs were quantitatively measured by radiolabeling the NPs with 14 C. Figure 4A shows the biodistribution of non-targeted NPs and NP-Fc over the course of 8 hours after oral administration to fasted wild-type mice. For the non-targeted NPs, a small amount of 14 C was measured in the organs. By contrast, a large amount of 14 C was measured in the spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs for NP-Fc, indicating that NP-Fc entered systemic circulation after oral administration and reached several organs known to express FcRn (11). The 14 C in the organs was transient, peaking at 2.5 h post-delivery and clearing from the organs at later time points (Fig. 4A). To ensure that the 14 C remained with the NPs over the course of the experiment, the release of 14 C from the NPs was measured and no release was observed over 24 h (Fig. 4B).",

Significantly higher amounts of 14 C were absorbed for NP-Fc at 1.5, 2.5, and 4 h compared with non-targeted NPs, indicating that Fc targeting enhanced absorption. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to calculate the oral absorption efficiency, which was 1.2%*h \u00b1 0.2 for non-targeted NPs and 13.7%*h \u00b1 1.3 for NP-Fc (mean \u00b1 SEM with n=5 mice per timepoint; P < 0.001, Student's t test). This difference in AUC suggests that IgG Fc targeting was responsible for an 11.5-fold increase in NP absorption."

                        "NP-Fc that are capable of encapsulating insulin were developed as a model NP-based therapeutic for diabetes that could be orally administered and evaluated for eliciting a pharmacologic response. Insulin NPs (insNP) were prepared using nanoprecipitation after dissolving insulin and PLA-PEG-MAL in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), resulting in an insulin load of 0.5% (w/w). The nanoprecipitation method allowed the particle size to remain small (mean hydrodynamic diameter, 57 nm) while still allowing insulin encapsulation. The release of insulin from insNP in PBS at 37\u00b0C demonstrated a strong burst release in the first hour followed by a controlled release (Fig. 5A). The insulin release profile was advantageous because it allowed all of the insulin to be delivered before complete clearance of the particles after 10 h. To determine the bioactivity, insulin released from insNP was collected and injected into fasted wild-type mice by tail-vein injection. The bioactivity was measured by monitoring the blood glucose and comparing the response to an equivalent dose of free insulin solution (3.3 U/kg). The released insulin generated a hypoglycemic response in mice (Fig. 5B), indicating that the encapsulated insulin was bioactive after release from the insNP.",
                        "The hypoglycemic response generated after oral administration of the targeted insNP (insNP-Fc) was tested using fasted wild-type mice and compared with the efficacies of nontargeted insNP, free insulin, and NP-Fc without insulin (Fig. 5C). The free insulin administered orally did not generate a glucose response in the mice, unlike the free insulin injected into the tail vein that was able to generate a glucose response (Fig. 4B). The NP-Fc without insulin also was unable to generate a glucose response. The glucose response generated by non-targeted insNP was not different from that generated by the control groups at any time point. However, insNP-Fc caused a significant hypoglycemic response in the mice, reducing the glucose during the first 10 h after administration. This is consistent with the biodistribution (Fig. 4A) and insulin release data (Fig. 5A), which demonstrated that the particles were cleared and the insulin was released within 10 h, respectively. The blood glucose level then increased and was similar to that of the control groups by 15 h. The insNP-Fc insulin dose required to generate the hypoglycemic response was 1.1 U/kg, which is clinically relevant (28) and lower than other oral insulin delivery systems that require 10-100 U/kg to generate a glucose response (29). When compared with the glucose response from free insulin administered by tail vein injection (Fig. 5B), the orally administered insNP-Fc resulted in a prolonged (15 h vs. 1.5 h) hypoglycemic response (Fig. 5C).",
                        "To demonstrate that the enhanced hypoglycemic response generated by insNP-Fc was due specifically to the IgG Fc ligand on the NP surface, several additional control groups were tested. The first control was to administer insNP-Fc concurrently with a 50-fold excess of free IgG Fc. The second control was to conjugate chicken IgY Fc fragments to insNP instead of human IgG Fc fragments. [Chicken IgY is the functional equivalent of IgG in non-mammalian species such as birds, but does not bind to mouse FcRn (30).] Both control groups had hypoglycemic responses that were significantly less than insNP-Fc (Fig. 5D), indicating that the use of the IgG Fc as a targeting ligand was responsible for the enhanced hypoglycemic response."

In contrast to the results in the wild-type mice (Fig. 5C), insNP-Fc did not generate a hypoglycemic response significantly different from the other three groups in the FcRn KO mice (Fig. 5F). In these FcRn KO mice, the response generated by insNP-Fc resembled the response generated by non-targeted insNP in the wild-type mice (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the benefit gained from using Fc was specifically due to FcRn."

In some cases, chronic diseases, such as cancer, that have been treated in the clinic with intravenous infusions are now increasingly being treated with oral therapeutics because patients prefer the convenience of oral administration relative to parenteral administration. For NP-based therapeutics to be a practical treatment of many diseases, NP formulations appropriate for oral administration are necessary. The most significant barrier to the effective oral administration of NPs is the intestinal epithelium, which limits the absorption of NPs. To date, there is no practical solution to this problem.",
                "There have been many attempts to develop oral drug delivery systems that overcome this barrier (29). For example, permeation enhancers have been used to open tight junctions to allow both paracellular and transcellular transport of drugs across the epithelium (31). Mucoadhesive biomaterials have been used to increase the retention time and local concentration of drugs near the apical surface of epithelial cells (32). Many oral NPs have been engineered for uptake by M cells in the Peyer's Patches, although this limits the surface area available for absorption and exposes NPs to underlying immune cells (33). Finally, a few NP formulations have targeted cell receptors, but they still suffer from low bioavailability and require high oral drug dosages (29,34).",
                "We have taken a novel approach to address this problem by developing drug encapsulated NPs capable of targeting FcRn for transepithelial transport and enhanced NP intestinal absorption after oral administration. FcRn has been shown to mediate the transcytosis of IgG across several epithelial and endothelial barriers (11), and more recently the transcytosis of fluorescent NPs was demonstrated across a monolayer of Calu-3 airway epithelial cells in vitro after adsorption of Fc on the NP surface (22). Harnessing the transcytosis pathway to cross the intestinal epithelium offers the advantage of leaving intact the integrity of the epithelial barrier, avoiding potential safety issues and adverse effects associated with manipulating the permeability of the intestine for paracellular or transcellular transport. An additional advantage of targeting the FcRn is that this receptor is expressed throughout the intestine, providing a significant increase in the available absorption surface area for NP-Fc, which is in contrast with other drug delivery systems that target only a specific portion of the intestine such as the Peyer's patches (6).",
                "We have demonstrated that targeting FcRn for transepithelial transport by modifying the NP surface with IgG Fc provides a successful approach for the oral delivery of NPs. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that FcRn enabled the NP-Fc to cross the intestinal epithelium and reach systemic circulation. The use of IgG Fc to target the NPs to FcRn resulted in absorption efficiency 11.5-fold higher than for nontargeted NPs, but the efficiency could potentially be higher, as some 14 C could have been absorbed in other tissues not measured in these studies. Furthermore, insNPs targeting FcRn, a model NPbased therapeutic for the treatment of diabetes, were able to generate a hypoglycemic response after oral administration at a clinically relevant insulin dose that is significantly lower than the doses required by other drug delivery systems designed for oral insulin delivery (29). Moreover, rodents significantly downregulate the FcRn expression in the intestine after weaning (35), but humans continue to express FcRn into adulthood. Therefore, while NP-Fc can increase transepithelial transport in mice, the transport in humans could potentially be even more efficient.",
                "There are some potential limitations to this technology that need to be investigated. For example, FcRn is expressed in many tissues in addition to the intestine. Using IgG Fc to target the FcRn could potentially result in uptake in tissues other than the targeted tissue. However, FcRn expression in tissues such as the vascular endothelium, blood-brain barrier, and lungs could also allow the technology to be expanded for drug delivery across other cellular barriers. Immunological responses to Fc on the NP surface need to be investigated as well. The presence of IgG Fc may result in faster blood clearance of the NPs due to interactions with Fc receptors. NP-Fc may also generate immunological responses and thus could potentially be used for oral vaccine applications (36).",
                "This technology may have a major impact on the treatment of several diseases by enabling NP-based therapies to be orally administered. In addition, the encapsulation of drugs or biologics that are currently limited by low bioavailability into NPs that target FcRn may enable markedly more efficient oral delivery of the therapies. The path forward for translation of this technology to the clinic is to test the NP-Fc in larger animal models such as pigs and non-human primates. Some key parameters that need to be understood for success in the clinic are the ideal release profile for an oral insulin formulation and how absorption varies based on diet and patient-to-patient variability."

Concurrently, 86 \u03bcg of purified human polyclonal IgG Fc prepared by papain digestion (Bethyl Laboratories) or 95 \u03bcg of chicken IgY Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA was reacted with 0.48 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL 2-iminothiolane (Traut's Reagent) for 1 h. The modified Fc was added to the NPs and mixed for 1 h to allow conjugation at 4\u00b0C. The NP-Fc were washed with PBS using Millipore Amicon Ultra 100,000 NMWL. The conjugation of IgG Fc to the NP surface was measured using a protein bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay from Lamda Biotech. Particle diameter and surface charge (zeta potential) were measured using dynamic light scattering with a Brookhaven Instruments ZetaPALS."

On the day of the transport experiment, the media was changed to HBSS pH 6.5 in the apical chamber and HBSS pH 7.4 in the basolateral chamber and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Prior to the experiment and at the end of the experiment, the monolayer integrity was checked by measuring the transepithelial resistance (TEER) using a Millicell-ERS (Millipore). TEER values were 900-1000 \u03a9/cm 2 for wells used in transport experiments and the TEER remained constant throughout the experiments. 3 H-labeled NPs were prepared by blending 50 \u03bcg 3 H-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (Perkin Elmer) with 1 mg PLA-PEG-MAL in 100 \u03bcL acetonitrile prior to nanoprecipitation in 500 \u03bcL water and then washed in HBSS pH 6.5 prior to the transport experiment. The apical solution was then replaced with a solution of 100 \u03bcg 3 H-labeled NPs or NP-Fc in 250 \u03bcL HBSS pH 6.5. The NP formulations were incubated for 24 h before measuring the 3 H content in the basolateral chamber. The basolateral solution was collected and added to a Hionic-Fluor scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer) before analysis using a Packard Tri-Carb Scintillation Analyser. At the end of the experiment, the TEER was measured again to verify monolayer integrity. For the IgG Fc blocking experiment, a 50x molar excess of IgG Fc relative to Fc on the NP-Fc surface was added concurrently with NP-Fc to the apical chamber, and the 3 H content in the basolateral chamber was measured after 24 h."
