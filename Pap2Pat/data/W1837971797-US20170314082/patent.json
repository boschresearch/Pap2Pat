                "The present invention relates in general to the field of recombinant protein production. In particular, the present invention relates to a method for selecting a suitable candidate cell clone for recombinant protein production and to a host cell for recombinant protein production, the host cell exhibiting artificially modified gene expression of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of: Hist1h2bc, Egr1, Bx842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, Vsnl1, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, and Ptpre.",
                "Production of recombinant proteins has become an important factor in modern biotechnology. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have become in many cases the host of choice because of their capacity for proper protein folding, assembly, and posttranslational modification. Moreover CHO cell lines have been well characterized and their history of regulatory approval for recombinant proteins produced from these cell lines is very well known. The most widely used expression system for recombinant protein production is the gene amplification procedure, which uses the CHO-Dhfr expression system. Moreover, CHO cells, just like many other host cell systems, are known to have a very unstable karyotype due to chromosome rearrangements arising from translocations and homologous recombination. Unstable recombinant protein production has been observed in 8-63% of all recombinant CHO cell lines, using DHFR/GS expression systems, in the presence or absence of selection pressure. Unstable recombinant protein production in turn leads to a loss in recombinant protein productivity. The exact molecular mechanism causing unstable recombinant protein production is not fully understood. Thus, the conventional methodologies involve empirically testing cell lines for long-term stable recombinant protein production and consequently require culturing said cell lines over extended periods of time (up to several months) prior to actual selection of cell lines for production purposes.",
                "Most publications in the art mainly focus on expression of the recombinant gene itself and its expression over time. Flow cytometry has also been used for identification of apoptotic cells which serve as a marker of unstable cells. For example, Dorai and colleagues have identified apoptosis as a possible cause of recombinant protein instability by using the flow cytometry method for identifying apoptotic cells (caspase 3 activity) in early cell line development. Examination by flow cytometry showed that caspase 3 and annexin V apoptotic markers could be used to identify cell lines with stable recombinant protein production (Dorai, H. et al., 2011, Biotechnol Bioeng, 109:1016-1030).",
                "In general, previous publications identified that instability of recombinant protein production during long term cultivation could result from recombinant gene loss during long term cultivation, especially when selection pressure is not present (Kim N S et al., 1998, Biotechnol Bioeng 60:679-688, Kim S J et al., 1999, Biotechnol Bioeng 64:741-749; Chuisanow J et al., 2009, Biotechnol Bioeng 102:1182-1196).",
                "However, there is still an immense need in the art for a means allowing identification of suitable, preferably long-term stable recombinant protein production, candidate cell clones early on in cell line development to avoid the need of long term cultivation and respective costs in terms of time and money.",
                "Thus, the problem to be solved by the present invention was to provide a means allowing identification of suitable, preferably long-term stable, candidate cell clones early on in cell line development. The inventor has solved said problem by way of the subject-matter set forth in the appended claims.",
                "In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a method for selecting a suitable candidate cell clone for recombinant protein expression, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n\n- - a) determining for at least two cell clones, preferably producing a\n    recombinant protein, the expression level of a gene selected from\n    the group consisting of:\n    - Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11,\n      Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1,\n      and Ptpre.\n  - b) selecting out of said at least two cell clones a cell clone for\n    further expansion, whose expression level of said gene is with\n    respect to the expression level of said same gene in at least one\n    other clone tested in step a):\n    - i) upregulated, if the gene is selected from the group of genes\n      consisting of:\n      - Hist1h2bc, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, AC115880.11, Fgfr2, Mmp10,\n        Vsnl1 and CU459186.17, or\n    - ii) downregulated, if the gene is selected from the group of genes\n      consisting of:\n      - Egr1, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, and Ptpre.",
                "In a preferred embodiment, Vsnl1 is not among the genes for which the expression level is determined, i.e. in such embodiments the expression level of a gene selected from the group consisting of:\n\n\n- - Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11,\n    Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, and\n    Ptpre  \n    is determined. This is reflected in the following by the indication\n    that Vsnl1 gene is optional, i.e. may or may not be in the group of\n    genes mentioned.",
                "The method according to the present invention allows a selection of a promising cell clone early on in cell line development without the need for long term cultivation and analysis. For this purpose the expression level of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1 (optional), and Ptpre is determined in step a) of the inventive method. If herein reference is made to determining the \u201cexpression level\u201d, then in particular the expression level of RNA expression is contemplated. While protein expression may theoretically also be used, said approach will usually be much less efficient. A person skilled in the art is readily familiar with determining expression levels, in particular of RNA. For example, as small aliquot may be removed from the candidate clone sample and quantitative RT-PCR may be used for determination of the respective expression levels. Moreover, determining the \u201cexpression level\u201d in the context of the inventive method refers to determining the \u201cexpression level\u201d of the endogenous gene(s) only, and not to determining the \u201cexpression level\u201d of the same genes if present as recombinant gene. For example, determining the expression level of Dhfr) means exclusively determining the expression level of the endogenous gene, e.g. hamster Dhfr (hDhfr), and not of Dhfr on a recombinant gene (recombinant Dhfr, rDhfr).",
                "Step a) refers to the determination of the expression level in at least two cell clones. Two cell clones are the minimum requirement to allow any comparison in expression level. Already for two clones it will be possible to decide with the method of the present invention, which of the two clones will most likely be the more promising candidate for cell line development. However, usually many more clones will be analysed. For example, the method of the invention may involve determining said expression level for at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 50, 75 or at least 100 candidate clones.",
                "The method of the present invention can be carried out prior to transfection, i.e. the cell clones need not yet express a recombinant gene (protein). In such scenario a pre-selection of a promising cell clone is already made by establishing clones of a given cell line and analysing them with the method of the invention. The selected clone or clones may then be used for transfection etc. Usually however, or even in addition, the expression level of the inventive group of genes is analysed after the host cell has been transfected or transformed and the respective culture has been plated to generate single cell clones. Then, the candidate clones express at least one recombinant protein. According to the invention, the type of recombinant protein expressed is not of relevance. It may be any type of recombinant protein. The recombinant protein may be for example an antibody, antibody light or heavy chain, a toxin, a cytokine, a growth factor, a growth factor receptor, an enzyme, or a hormone. Preferably, the recombinant protein is an antibody. As the type of recombinant protein expressed is not of particular relevance for the present invention, it is not a prerequisite, although preferred, that the clones (for which the expression level of a particular gene is determined in step a) of the inventive method) express the very same recombinant protein (see also further below). Ideally, they should however preferably at least express the same type of recombinant protein or a recombinant protein of comparable size. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the recombinant protein expressed by said clones is the same type of recombinant protein, such as an antibody.",
                "The method of the present invention may be carried out by determining the expression level of only one gene selected from the group consisting of: Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1 (optional) and Ptpre. In particularly preferred embodiments, the expression level of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c and Dhfr is determined. In other embodiments, the expression level of at least one gene selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, Mmp10 (optional) and Ptpre, or from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, and Ptpre is determined.",
                "However, while the invention may be carried out by determining the expression level of only one gene selected from said group, analysis of more than one gene may prove helpful for the selection decision. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the expression level of more than one gene selected from the group consisting of Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1 (optional) and Ptpre is determined. For example, an inventive method may involve determining the expression level of at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13 or all 14 genes of said group. It is particularly preferred if the expression level of at least three genes of said group are determined. More preferably, the expression level of at least three genes of said group are determined and the at least three genes encompass at least one gene selected from the group consisting of Egr1, Hist1h2bc and Dhfr or at least one gene selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, Mmp10 and Ptpre or at least one gene selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, and Ptpre. Even more preferably, the expression level of at least Egr1, Hist1h2bc and Dhfr is determined in step a) of the inventive method, or of at least three genes selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, Mmp10 and Ptpre or at least three genes selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, and Ptpre.",
                "In most embodiments of the present invention the expression level will be determined in step a) of the inventive method in parallel. However, that need not necessarily be the case. For example, there may be a first round of cloning, in which at least one clone is analysed as required by step a). The expression levels determined for said clone (or clones) may then serve for later cloning experiments as reference (the reference clone has still been analysed as required by step a) of the inventive method, albeit at a different point in time). Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the expression level for said gene or genes are not determined in parallel in step a) for said at least two cell clones. In particular, in such scenario it also becomes evident that the recombinant protein expressed by said at least two clones need not be identical (see above). For example, if in a first round of cloning a particular promising (or disappointing) clone for antibody A has been identified, the respective expression levels may serve as reference for later cloning experiments with clones for antibody B (see in this respect also further below the passage on selection of a candidate clone by indirect means). While the expression levels of the cell need not be determined in parallel, the conditions under which the expression levels are determined should of course be preferably identical. For example, step a) is preferably carried out after the same time span after cloning, e.g. within two weeks after cloning (e.g. in the time period of 48 hours to 14 days after cloning, 72 hours to 14 days after cloning, 48 hours to 10 days after cloning, 72 hours to 10 days after cloning, etc.), even more preferably within one week after cloning (e.g. in the time period of 48 hours to 7 days after cloning, 72 hours to 7 days after cloning, 48 hours to 4 days after cloning, 72 hours to 4 days after cloning, etc.). Furthermore, the expression level of said gene or genes is preferably determined for said at least two clones in early log phase (exponential phase) of growth. A person skilled in the art will be familiar with the respective cell culturing techniques and can ascertain said condition, e.g. by appropriate splitting of the cultures and replenishing of fresh media. General culture conditions should preferably be identical, except maybe for necessary deviations, e.g. with respect to antibiotic resistance selection, amplification with MTX etc. It is self-evident, that the cell background (e.g. CHO cell) of the clones analysed in step a) of the inventive method may not be different.",
                "The method of the present invention is not limited to a particular type of host cell. Since instability and associated loss in productivity is frequently encountered, the method of the present invention may be applied in principle to any type of host cell. However, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the cell clones used for the method of the present invention are mammalian cell clones, such as human or rodent cell clones. Particularly preferred are CHO cell clones, such as CHO-K1 cell clones or CHO-K1PD cell clones, which have been particularly analysed in the present case.",
                "As mentioned previously, in preferred embodiments of the present invention the determining of the expression level in step a) involves quantitative RT-PCR. A person skilled in the art will understand, that the present invention contemplates in particular the specific detection and determination of the expression levels of the specific gene or genes selected from the group consisting of Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1 (optional) and Ptpre. Thus, step a) of the method of the present invention does preferably not involve complete transcriptome profiling, at least not for all clones tested.",
                "The sequence of the genes selected from the group consisting of Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1 (optional) and Ptpre are known in the art and are publically available from respective databases. A person skilled in the art will be readily capable to design forward primers, reverse primers and probes in general for these genes and for the respective species of interest. For the Chinese hamster exemplary forward primers, reverse primers and probes are given for all 14 genes in table 1 further down below.",
                "Once the relative expression level for the gene or genes has been obtained it should preferably be log2 transformed, i.e., in preferred embodiments of the invention the expression level is compared and the clone is selected on basis of relative expression values (log2 FC). The expression values should be normalized based on housekeeping or reference genes (e.g. GAPDH or ACTB, for which the expression is considered to be constant under all conditions) to render the obtained values also comparable between different experiments. For the statistical analysis the relative quantification approach can be used. Preferably, the geometric means of the Cq values of all reference genes are used as the final reference gene values.",
                "In the inventive method, step b) requires selecting out of said at least two cell clones a cell clone for further expansion, whose expression level of said gene is with respect to the expression level of said same gene in at least one other clone tested in step a):\n\n\n- - i) upregulated, if the gene is a gene selected from the group of\n    genes consisting of:\n    - Hist1h2bc, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, AC115880.11, Fgfr2, Mmp10,\n      Vsnl1 (optional) and, CU459186.17, or\n  - ii) downregulated, if the gene is a gene selected from the group of\n    genes consisting of: Egr1, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, and\n    Ptpre.",
                "As mentioned previously, there may be more than two cell clones, e.g. the selection can be made in some embodiments from at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 50, 75 or at least 100 or more candidate clones. The selection of the respective clone in step b) is straightforward based on the respective expression level if only for one gene the expression level is determined. The \u201cat least one other clone tested in step a)\u201d may be the clone with the worst expression level among the clones tested for said gene. Consequently, the method of the present invention allows in principle to choose the second worst candidate. While choosing the second worst candidate clone may not seem to be the most logical choice, said choice is still better than choosing the clone with the worst expression levels. Moreover, the second worst candidate clone may still exhibit excellent expression level values. In other words, the present invention allows eliminating at least the worst choice. However, in most circumstances where more than two clones are analysed the person skilled in the art will usually not select the second worst candidate, but one of the best candidates if not the best candidate, i.e. the clone exhibiting the best expression level for the respective gene. In the latter scenario the selected clone does not only exhibit a better expression level vis-\u00e0-vis \u201cone other clone tested in step a)\u201d, but vis-\u00e0-vis all other tested clones. In preferred embodiments, the selected clone exhibits a better expression level vis-\u00e0-vis 50% of all other tested clones (above mean), more preferably 75% of all other tested clones, more preferably vis-\u00e0-vis 80% of all other tested clones, more preferably vis-\u00e0-vis 85% of all other tested clones, more preferably vis-\u00e0-vis 90% of all other tested clones, more preferably vis-\u00e0-vis 95% of all other tested clones, most preferably a better expression level than all other tested clones. Preferably, a clone is selected, whose expression level differs from the (mean) expression level of the same gene in the at least one other clone by at least a two-fold change (log2).",
                "In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method of the invention a clone is selected in step b), whose expression level for Egr1, Hist1h2bc or Dhfr is superior to the expression level of said gene in at least one other clone tested in step a). In a further particularly preferred embodiment of the method of the invention a clone is selected in step b), whose expression levels for three genes selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, Mmp10 or Ptpre taken together are superior to the expression level of said genes in at least one other clone tested in step a). Said group of genes has proven to be particularly useful, if MTX selection is applied.",
                "As will be easily understood, the term \u201cbest expression level\u201d (or \u201csuperior expression level\u201d) is a necessary relative term and its meaning will depend on the gene under scrutiny. For genes selected from the group consisting of Hist1h2bc, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, AC115880.11, Fgfr2, Mmp10, Vsnl1 (optional) and CU459186.17 (upregulation group), a clone is selected exhibiting an upregulated (i.e. higher) expression level in comparison to the \u201cat least one other clone tested in step a)\u201d. For genes selected from the group consisting of Egr1, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, and Ptpre (downregulation group), a clone is selected exhibiting an expression level which is downregulated (i.e. lower). For the upregulation group the value of the clone with the lowest expression value can be set as reference value and the results for the other clones may then be expressed as fold change (FC) vis-\u00e0-vis said expression value. For the downregulation group the value of the clone with the highest expression value can be set as reference value and the results for the other clones may then be expressed as fold change (FC) vis-\u00e0-vis said expression value.",
                "As mentioned above, while determining the expression level of one gene selected from the group consisting of Hist1h2bc, Egr1, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, Fgfr2, AC115880.11, Mmp10, CU459186.17, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, Vsnl1 (optional) and Ptpre is encompassed by the present invention, the present invention also contemplates determining the expression level of more than one gene. While in such scenario (more than one expression level determined) the subsequent selection decision can in principle be still be based on only one of the determined expression levels (i.e. not all expression levels determined need to be taken into account), said selection decision will usually be made by taking into account the results for more than one gene. As long as the genes are from the same group of genes (upregulation group: Hist1h2bc, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, Dhfr, AC115880.11, Fgfr2, Mmp10, Vsnl1 (optional) and CU459186.17; downregulation group: Egr1, E130203B14Rik, Cspg4, C1qtnf1, Foxp2, and Ptpre) the expression level results can be simply taken together. If the expression level of genes from both groups have been determined and are taken into consideration for the selection, then one must invert the algebraic sign for the values of one group, e.g. for the downregulation group (a \u22121.5 fold change in expression value (downregulation) is considered to be a (+) 1.5 FC), to allow combination of the expression values of the different groups. Eventually, a clone may be selected in such embodiments for further expansion, whose expression level taken together for said genes is superior to the level of said genes taken together in at least one other clone tested in step a).",
                "In a particularly preferred embodiment of the method of the invention a clone is selected in step b), whose expression level is for two, or more preferably even for three genes selected from the group consisting of Egr1, Hist1h2bc and Dhfr superior (i.e. downregulated for Egr1, upregulated for Hist1h2bc and Dhfr to the expression level of said genes in at least one other clone tested in step a).",
                "In other embodiments, a clone is selected in step b), whose expression level is for two, or more preferably even for three genes selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, Mmp10 or Ptpre (or selected from the group consisting of Fgfr2, BX842664.2/Hist1h3c, E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, or Ptpre) taken together superior (i.e. downregulated for E130203b14Rik, Cspg4, or Ptpre, upregulated for Fgfr2, or BX842664.2/Hist1h3c) to the expression levels of said genes in at least one other clone tested in step a).",

Thus, in an embodiment of the invention, a clone may be selected in step b) for further expansion, whose expression level for said genes is superior to the mean expression level taken together for said genes, respectively, as determined for two or more other clones tested in step a). Preferably, a clone is selected, whose expression level differs from the (mean) expression levels of the same genes in the at least one other clone by at least a two-fold change (log2).",
                "As previously discussed, the selection in step b) of the method of the invention is based on a comparison of the expression level (or levels) of the selected clone with at least one other clone tested in step a). The selected clone must exhibit a \u201csuperior\u201d expression level for the respective genes (up- or downregulated, depending on the gene(s) analyzed). However, the present invention also contemplates a selection of a clone on basis of an indirect comparison. In such scenario, a (first) clone may be selected indirectly on basis of a comparable or superior expression level for said gene (or expression levels taken together for said genes, respectively), as compared to at least one other clone tested in step a) (the second clone), provided said at least one other clone (the second clone) has been previously verified to have a superior expression level for said gene (or expression levels taken together for said genes, respectively), as compared to at least one further clone (third clone) tested in step a). In other words, if previously an advantageous clone (the second clone) has already been identified (advantageous vis-\u00e0-vis the third clone), then the new (first) clone can be selected already on basis of a comparable (or superior) expression level vis-\u00e0-vis the second clone, because the new (first) clone will inevitably fulfil the criterion of having an advantageously up- or downregulated expression level for the respective gene or genes vis-\u00e0-vis the third clone.",
                "The method according to the present invention is certainly not limited to selecting only one clone. Rather, more than one cell clone may be selected on basis of the prerequisites of step b) for further expansion.",
