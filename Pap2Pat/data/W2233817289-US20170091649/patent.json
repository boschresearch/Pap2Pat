    "abstract": "Example methods and mechanisms are described herein for implementing and adiabatically operating a topological quantum computing (TQC) phase gate that complements the existing Clifford operations, and thereby allows universal quantum computation with Majorana systems. Further embodiments include a testing system for the phase gate that is feasible with Majorana zero modes and demonstrates violations of the CHSH-Bell inequality. Further, the design used for the testing of the inequality leads directly to a practical platforms for performing universal TQC with Majorana wires in which explicit braiding need never occur. Thus, certain embodiments of the disclosed technology involve three synergistically connected aspects of anyonic TQC the context of the currently active area of using MZMs for topological quantum computation): a practical phase gate for universal topological quantum computation using MZMs, a precise protocol (using CHSH inequality) for testing that the desired gate operation has been achieved, and bypassing the necessity of MZM braiding (and so avoiding, e.g., problems of nonadiabaticity in the braids).",

                        "Certain example embodiments concern a method for operating an adjustable phase gate in a quantum circuit, the adjustable phase gate comprising a stationary pair of Ising anyons. Example implementations comprise the acts of causing a mobile Ising anyon to pass through the adjustable phase gate, thereby creating a targeted phase change in the stationary pair of Ising anyons; and controlling the mobile Ising anyon as the mobile Ising anyon passes through the adjustable phase gate so that the mobile Ising anyon has a complex amplitude during passage. Further, the controlling is performed such that the targeted phase change experienced by the stationary pair of Ising anyons is between 0 and \u03c0 or 0 and \u2212\u03c0. In particular implementations, the controlling comprises performing one or more of: (a) adjusting a gate voltage of one or more gates capacitively coupled to one or more superconducting islands that form the adjustable phase gate, (b) adjusting a capacitance of the one or more superconducting islands; or (c) adjusting a strength of at least one Josephson junction relative to at least one other Josephson junction, the Josephson junctions connecting two or more of the superconducting islands to one another. In some implementations, the method further comprises, in a first operational stage, altering a magnetic flux through the adjustable phase gate in a first direction, the first direction comprising either increasing the magnetic flux or decreasing the magnetic flux; and, in a second operational stage, altering the magnetic flux through the adjustable phase gate in a second direction that is opposite of the first direction. Further, in some examples, during either or both operational stages, the method can comprises adjusting a strength of a first Josephson junction at a first end of a superconducting region in the adjustable phase gate; and, during either or both operational stages, adjusting a strength of a second Josephson junction at a second end of the superconducting region in the adjustable phase gate, wherein h strengths of the first and second Josephson junctions are selected to create a relative difference that produces the targeted phase change in the Ising pair. In some examples, the adjustable phase gate comprises a plurality of superconducting regions arranged to form a superconducting loop, wherein adjacent ones of the superconducting regions are connected to one another via respective Josephson junctions, and herein one of the superconducting regions comprises a Majorana wire located on the one of the superconducting regions. In certain example embodiments, the adjustable phase gate is implemented in a transmission line resonator comprising three Majorana wires arranged to form a qubit between a bus and a phase ground of the e transmission line resonator. In some example embodiments, the method further comprises measuring one or more Pauli operators of the qubit by selectively controlling: (a) Josephson couplings between a first superconducting region on which a first Majorana wire is located and a bus and phase ground; and (b) Josephson couplings between a second superconducting region on which a second Majorana wire is located and the bus and the phase ground. In some example embodiments, the superconducting loop that is desirable for the phase gate is formed by the second superconducting region, the phase ground, and a third superconducting region containing no Majorana wire.",

In some implementations, the magnetic field generator and the capacitance of one lore of the superconducting components are controllable to draw a Josephson vortex into the superconducting loop. Further, in certain examples, the superconducting components comprise first and second superconducting islands connected to a bulk superconductor. In some implementations, for example, the first superconducting island is connected to the bulk superconductor via a first controllable Josephson junction, the second superconducting island is connected to the bulk superconductor via a second controllable Josephson junction, and the first superconducting island is connected to the second superconducting island via a third Josephson junction. In certain examples, only the first and second Josephson junctions are controllable. Still further, the phase gate can be part of a greater system. For instance, in some example embodiments disclosed herein, a microwave resonator system configured to implement a qubit register between a bus and a phase ground is disclosed, the qubit register comprising the phase gate as described above. In some implementations of such systems, the Majorana wire is a first Majorana wire, and the plurality of superconducting components arranged in a ring comprises: a first superconducting component coupled to the phase ground via a first controllable Josephson junction and coupled to the bus via a second controllable Josephson junction, the first Majorana wire being located on the first superconducting component; and a second superconducting component coupled to the phase ground via a third controllable Josephson junction and coupled to the first superconducting component via a fixed Josephson junction, the second superconducting component being disconnected from the bus. In some examples, the microwave resonator further comprises: a third superconducting component coupled to the phase ground via a fifth controllable Josephson junction and to the bus via a sixth controllable Josephson junction; a second Majorana wire located on the third superconducting component; a third Majorana wire located on a superconducting component connected to the bus, the first, second and third Majorana wires being positioned to create the qubit register with no braiding mechanism. In some examples, a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CISH) inequality or Bell inequality measurement system is disclosed, in which the system comprises the phase gate as described here.",

In some implementations, the regions are superconducting regions, and the regions form a superconducting loop. In certain implementations, the Josephson vortex produces a phase change to a qubit stored in a qubit register formed with the quantum circuit phase gate. In some implementations, the method comprises selectively varying the phase change between 0 and \u03c0 or 0 and \u2212\u03c0.",

                                "Implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation using physical qubits is a goal for developers of quantum computers. Unique among such efforts is so-called topological quantum computation (\u201cTQC\u201d), which utilizes exotic non-Abelian quasiparticles in storing the qubits. These anyons, the most prominent examples of which are zero-energy localized excitations(called \u201cMajorana zero modes\u201d) in the superconducting gaps of certain types of topological superconductors, are neither fermions nor bosons, obeying instead a non-Abelian statistics in two-dimensional systems. As nonlocal topological objects, these anyonic quasiparticles are immune to local perturbations in the system, and thus have the characteristic property of having little or no quantum decoherence, making them desirable from the perspective of quantum computation.",
                                "Disclosed herein are embodiments for addressing a current roadblock in carrying out anyonic TQC by providing mechanisms and methods for carrying out universal qua computation using Majorana qubits. Also disclosed are mechanisms and methods for connecting the anyonic TQC with fundamental aspects of quantum nonlocality through the observation of a particular variant of the Bell inequality using Majorana zero modes as a clear signal of the universality of the underlying topological quantum computing platform.",
                                "Universal quantum computation involves the operator having the ability to produce any quantum state in the computational Hilbert space, including in particular those that violate the limits imposed on local hidden variable theories by the Bell inequality or its variants such as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (\u201cCHSH\u201d) inequality. Even with the aid of measurement, however, a topological quantum computer based on the braiding of anyonic Majorana fermion zero modes (\u201cMZMs\u201d) cannot create such a state in a topologically protected manner. This is related to the fact that the braids and measurements of MZMs together form a representation of the Clifford group, which is classically simulable. This limitation of MZMs in carrying out universal quantum computation arises from the Ising (or SU (2)2) nature of the corresponding topological quantum field theory (\u201cTQFT\u201d) which enables only \u03c0/2 rotations in the Hilbert space of the qubits through braiding. (The surface code implementation in superconducting quints, which is one of the most promising practical approaches to quantum computation at the present time, also suffers from the of only supporting Clifford group operations in a natural way.)",
                                "While there are many theoretical proposals for going beyond MZMs (e.g., beyond the Ising anyon universality) which, in principle, could lead to universal topological quantum computation by utilizing richer TQFT (e.g. SU (2)3 or Fibonacci anyons), no such system has been experimentally demonstrated. Furthermore, these richer systems enabling universal TQC often require extremely complicated braiding operations involving very high overhead in order to approximate Clifford group operations, which themselves are useful for quantum error correcting codes.",
                                "It is therefore desirable to develop quantum computing approaches that specifically use MZMs (potentially some additional operations) to carry out inherently quantum-mechanical tasks beyond the constraint of the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In particular, it has been observed that the \u201cprotected\u201d operations of braiding and measurement on MZMs (and also the surface code) become universal for quantum computation when supplemented with a single qubit phase gate of small enough angle. The so-called \u03c0/8 phase gate (or T gate) e\u2212i\u03c0/8|00|+ei\u03c0/8|11| is often named as part of a universal gate set. In part, this is because of the \u201cmagic state distillation\u201d protocol that corrects errors in noisy T gates through the use of Clifford gates and measurement. See S. Bravyi and A. Kitaev, Phys. Rev. A 71, 022316 (2005), quant-ph/0403025. However, any single qubit phase gate that produces a phase difference 0 between be two qubit states with \u03b8\u2260n\u03c0/4 for integer n is sufficient for universal quantum computation as long as it can be produced consistently. (In fact, it would be useful for the reduction of overhead to be able to produce a phase gate of arbitrary angle, and there are now error correction algorithms designed this in mind.)",
                                "In this disclosure, example methods and mechanisms are described for implementing and adiabatically performing the phase gate that complements the existing Clifford operations, and thereby allows universal quantum computation with Majorana systems. In order to test such a gate, a quantum demonstration feasible with MZMs, namely, violations of CHSH-Bell inequality, is also disclosed. Further, the design used for the testing of the inequality leads directly to a practical platform for performing universal TQC with Majorana wires in which explicit braiding need never occur. Thus, certain embodiments of the disclosed technology involve three synergistically connected aspects of anyonic TQC (in the context of the currently active area of using MZMs for topological quantum computation): a practical phase gate for universal topological quantum computation using MZMs, a precise protocol (using CHSH inequality) for testing that the desired gate operation has been achieved, and bypassing the necessity of MZM braiding (and so avoiding, for example, problems of nonadiabaticity in the braids). Any one or more of these developments can be used alone or in combination with one another.",
                                "In designing the phase gate and the quantum computation platform, example embodiments disclosed herein take a \u201cblack box\u201d approach to the Majorana wire system itself, avoiding as much as possible the manipulation of parameters that might change the topological nature of the wire state, or tune couplings between the MZMs. This approach is advantageous due to the continuously-developing nature of the Majorana field. Particular embodiments focus on a universal aspect of the Majorana system: a well-developed degeneracy associated with the fermion parity of a given wire. This approach (based in \u201cmeasurement-only\u201d TQC) is entirely sufficient for producing and testing the adiabatic phase gate and (by extension) for universal quantum computation. See, e.g., P. Bonderson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 010501 (2008), arXiv:0802.0279, and P. Bonderson et al., Annals of Physics 324, 787 (2009), arXiv:0808.1933.",
                                "In Section III below, the CHSH inequalities are reviewed in the context of Majorana zero mode physics. A measurement of violations of the CHSH-Bell Inequalities is a useful step in demonstrating not only the fundamental quantum physics and non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes, but also the departure from the Clifford group that is necessary for universal quantum computation. In particular, it has been shown that operations capable of producing a violation of the CHSH inequality, when combined with Clifford operations, are sufficient for universal quantum computation. This may be thought of as a refinement of the usual error-correction bound given by magic-state distillation. Put another way, if a phase gate produces a violation of the CHSH inequalities then it falls within the error-correction bound. Thus, a CHSH measurement be used as a single-number benchmark of the quality of a gate, rather than relying on tomography of the entire produced state.",
                                "In Sections IV-V, embodiments of a new type of phase gate are introduced and analyzed. Other proposals for introducing a single qubit phase gate into a Majorana-wire based system have been fundamentally limited by timing errors due to the largely unknown relaxation rates involved in the detailed wire physics. In certain embodiments of the disclosed technology, however, these limitations are bypassed by eliminating timing errors entirely, and instead performing (or operating) the phase gate adiabatically. In some example implementations, the disclosed phase gate uses elements such as semiconductor Majorana wires, superconductors, magnetic fields, and Josephson junctions and may be integrated into designs that use these elements for various other purposes (e.g., for braiding and Majorana-based memory) without much additional overhead. For example, embodiments of the disclosed phase gate can be integrated with designs such as those described in T. Hyart et al., Phys. Rev. B 88, 035121 (2013), 1303.4379. For this reason, certain example embodiments disclosed herein are designs that are appropriate for corporation into such a system. However, these embodiments are not limiting, as the technology is adaptable for use in a variety of Majorana wire systems.",
                                "In Sec. VI below, example experimental setups for benchmarking the new phase gate using the CHSH inequalities are discussed, in contrast to various exotic proposals for going beyond MZMs and SU (2)2 TQFT, certain example experimental setups disclosed herein do not require building new experimental platforms, but use already existing and extensively experimentally studied semiconductor nanowire-based MZM platforms. Further, the experiments discussed below establish the non-Abelian nature of the Majorana zero modes as well as test example embodiments of the disclosed phase gate. In some examples, measurement-based procedures directly equivalent to Majorana braiding are performed in the same architecture. In fact, embodiments of the disclosed system provide a simpler platform for effectively braiding with nanowire MZMs than other proposals in the sense that no coupling needs to be fine-tuned between the various Majorana modes.",
                                "In Sec. VII, example embodiments of a scalable memory register capable of measuring any Pauli operator on a set of qubits are described. The architecture of particular example implementations disclosed herein use only one junction of Majorana wires per qubit, greatly simplifying fabrication requirements for a Majorana-wire platform. Combined with the phase gate of Sec. IV, this design enables universal fault tolerant quantum computation using nanowire MZMs. Embodiments of the disclosed technology were designed with elements in mind that are available now, but the principles behind the disclosed phase gate and memory design examples are adaptable to any known or future Majorana wire system."

FIG. 8 shows that the resonance in the dynamic range (corresponding to the degeneracy point for the quoit states) does not always occur exactly at Q1+Q2=0.25, Higher order corrections to the instanton calculation will detect the asymmetry in the system, leading to dependence of the resonance Q1\u2212Q2 and e.

Hassler et al. can be used. (See, e.g., F. Hassler et at New Journal of Physics 13, 095004 (2011), 1105.0315.) In particular, the measurement scheme allows the parity of a pair of Majorana fermions to be read out through a superconducting charge qubit in a trans transmission line resonator (a \u201ctransition\u201d). (See, e.g., J. Koch et al., Phys. Rev. A 76, 042319 (2007), URL http://link.aps.org/doi/10.11.03/PhysRevA.76.042319 for additional details concerning example transmon configurations that can be used with embodiments of the disclosed technology.)",

This is in line with the so-called \u201cMeasurement Only\u201d schemes for topological quantum computation. (See, e.g., P. Bonderson. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 010501 (2008), arXiv:0802.0279; and P. Bonderson et al., Annals of Physics 324, 787 (2009), arXiv:0808.1933.) In the illustrated arrangement, each of the islands containing Majorana wires is attached through a series of adjustable Josephson junctions to the larger superconducting region on either the top (Bus 950) or bottom (Phase Ground 952). It is assumed that the coupling between the three Majoranas at each of the trijunctions is strong compared with the charging energy of the islands, and is comparable to the Josephson energy at junction J8 during the performance of the phase gate. Due to this large coupling, the Majorana at the left end of the wire in FIG. 3 is effectively replaced by the zero mode of the trijunction.",

Again, the trijunction coupling is assumed to be large compared with the measurement scale so that the trijunctions are treated as effectively single MZMs. The X and Z components of the upper qubit may be measured by connecting the islands containing the corresponding MZMs strongly to the Bus while connecting all other islands to the Phase Ground, as illustrated in FIG. 11. Similarly, measurements of the lower qubit may be made by connecting the corresponding islands strongly to the Phase Ground, as illustrated in FIG. 12. Because the resonator measurement determines the total parity connected to the Bus, the parity of the islands connected to the Phase Ground may be inferred once the overall parity of the Majorana system is measured. In FIG. 10, this is labeled a \u201cTare\u201d measurement.",

In most cases, only two settings are needed for the Josephson junctions, strong connection EJ>>EC (On), and very weak connection EJ>>EC(Off). This switching can be controlled, for example, by threading half a flux between two strong Josephson junctions. The two Josephson junctions in the lower right of FIG. 9, labeled 7 and 8, adjust the phase gate in the manner described above, acting as control parameters for J1 and J2 . A strong Josephson coupling J3 is assumed between the two islands in the lower right. While the phase gate is being implemented, Junctions 2 and 3 should be off, allowing flux to pass freely between e island containing the lower right Majorana wire (\u201cy\u201d) and the remaining wires. The loop in the lower right now acts as the superconducting loop of FIG. 3 for implementing the phase gate around the y-axis. The remaining Josephson junctions should be on, so that no measurement path is open in the resonator system and all other islands have the superconducting phase inherited from the Phase Ground 952. In this case, the Josephson en of the lower trijunction acts to renormalize the coupling J1 in the phase gate design of FIG. 3.",

These tests of the CHSH inequality are no more daunting than tests of braiding, yet are better targeted toward the eventual implementation of quantum information processing in Majorana-based platforms. In fact,it has been shown that any operation capable of producing a violation of the CHSH inequality, when combined with Clifford operations, is sufficient for universal quantum computation. By contrast, the protocols described herein with reference to FIGS. 10-13 are not necessarily tests of quantum nonlocality itself, as it is unlikely that the qubits in the example configurations will be space-like separated. In any case, it is clear that nonlocality is not sufficient for universal quantum computation, as it may be achieved in Ising anyons through braiding alone (a system that does not even suffice for universal classical computation).",
