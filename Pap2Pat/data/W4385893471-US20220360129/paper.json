    "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated magnetics, insulation, and cooling architecture to improve the thermal performance of a high frequency permanent magnet (PM) motor. The proposed architecture can be used for any motor topology to improve its thermal and insulation performance. The proposed stator yoke design interleaves copper sheets between yoke core lamination to achieve better thermal conduction from winding to heat sink. A ceramic winding holder is integrated into the armature to introduce a parallel thermal conduction path from windings to the iron yoke and to provide additional insulation. The architecture is applied to a 300 kW slotless PM synchronous motor consisting of an outer rotor Halbach PM array, slotless stator, and heatsink. 3D electromagnetic finite element methods (FEM), 2D heat transfer FEM, and an analytical thermal circuit are used to analyze the architectures impact on torque production, eddy currents, and thermal performance when compared to the baseline motor. Finally, a pole-pair prototype was built as a proof-of-concept and to verify the performance benefits of the proposed architecture.",

                "LECTRIC vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft require compact, high power, high reliability electric motors and drives. Power demand on the electric aircraft propulsion (EAP) system during take-off and landing can be up to 3-10x cruise power [1,2], and copper loss during these flight phases rises due to increased current density. As a result, the temperature in the conducting region can grow quickly to levels that threaten insulation failure. This paper presents an embedded cooling architecture that enhances heat transfer from the coils to the heatsink and prevents excessive temperatures [3]. The proposed machine topology is a slotless permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) outrunner which achieves high electrical loading by extending the armature cross-section into area traditionally occupied by iron teeth [4,5], making it suitable for the operating profiles of eVTOL aircraft [6]. The slotless structure trades-off magnetic loading and associated iron loss for electrical loading and associated copper loss.",
                "Two critical features of the proposed integrated magnetics, insulation, and cooling architecture (MAGICA) are: a) To address the high loss concentration in the formwound coils of a slotless stator, thin copper sheets are interleaved within the iron lamination stack to provide a thermal shunt from coils to heatsink. b) Implement a ceramic coil holder which enhances both the side-wall thermal path and electrical insulation [7]. Several simulations were performed with a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) and a lumped element thermal equivalent circuit to confirm the modified motor's performance. The former is for obtaining electromagnetic performance including torque production, iron loss, and eddy current loss according to interleaved copper sheet thickness [8]. The latter is for estimating the thermal impact of the interleaved copper/iron yoke and ceramic holder. The combined performance is compared with a baseline motor with conventional iron core laminations and no coil holder [9]. Finally, a prototype is built and experimentally tested to demonstrate qualitative performance improvements. Results show the proposed architecture is feasible to construct, suitable for electric aircraft propulsion, and provides significant thermal performance benefits.",

                                "Thermal limits [10] and electrical insulation [11] are the two critical reliability concerns identified in these motors for EAP applications. Fig. 2 (a) shows a 2-D cross-section of the current slotless stator cooling architecture as implemented in both a 1-MW machine [12] and a 300-kW machine [13]. In comparison, Fig. 2 (b) shows a 2-D cross-section of the proposed MAGICA topology which improves the thermal and dielectric performance of the baseline motor, making it more robust and torque dense. MAGICA consists of three independent thermal improvements, each lowering separate elements in the series thermal impedance from winding to coolant. The first layer consists of a ceramic coil holder in which the form-wound Litz conductors are placed. This coil holder introduces an additional side-wall parallel heat path from the windings to the heat sink. Furthermore, the ceramic improves line-to-ground and line-toline insulation, reducing the risk of insulation failure and partial discharge activity. The second layer a yoke composed of interleaved iron and copper lamination. High thermal conductivity thin copper sheets are periodically inserted within the lamination stack to thermally shunt the flux-supporting magnetic iron and its relatively poor thermal properties. A third layer consists of an additively manufactured heat sink which improves air-side heat transfer over the baseline radial fin heat sink through increased surface area. Parallel thermal paths are marked on the lumped circuit model to demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed topology. The remainder of this paper will discuss in detail only the first two improvements of MAGICA, future work will focus on the design and optimization of an improved, axially-varying heat sink. Given the material properties tabulated in Table II, the thermal resistance of each lumped element can be calculated from the stator dimensions,"

                                "Two material candidates for the ceramic coil holder were identified; both Aluminum Nitride (AlN) and Boron Nitride  (BN) are machinable and have attractive thermal, electrical, and structural properties. The remainder of this paper will utilize the relatively less mature and more expensive AlN material, which promises better performance across the board when compared to BN. Choosing the dimensions of the coil holder is non-trivial due to the 'C'-shaped geometry. In general, the ceramic thickness at the base of the coil holder should be made as thin as possible to minimize its purely series thermal impedance and adverse consequences on EM performance from an increased airgap. However, there exist an optimal thickness of the coil holder fins (between conductors); too thick of ceramic fins reduces the available conduction area, increasing the current and loss density. Conversely, too thin of ceramic fins nullifies the parallel thermal path. An additional constraint is that there exists a lower limit for the machinable thickness of the ceramic material. A steady-state thermal FEA study was carried out in the open-source FEMM software to determine the optimal fin thickness for a given base thickness by minimizing \u0394\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 . The simulation setup is shown in Fig. 4 and only concerns the ceramic and conductor region. Heat is forced to dissipate through the base of the heatsink by including an insulating airgap. The results of the study are plotted in Fig. 5 for several base thicknesses and are used later in this paper when combined with results from ceramic test cuts to determine the final coil holder dimensions."

Using the numbers given in Table II, two curves are generated and shown in Fig. 6: one including the ceramic coil holder and one only including the interleaved copper laminations. The dashed horizontal line denotes the baseline thermal resistance, corresponding to 0% copper fill and no ceramics. Just by including interleaved copper sheets into the yoke stack, the equivalent thermal resistance from conductor to heatsink is reduced by 40% at just 20% copper fill. Including ceramics in the analysis, an additional 10% reduction in equivalent thermal resistance is observed. A saturation of the benefits is also observed at larger copper fills due to the form-wound Litz conductors becoming the thermal bottleneck. The next section will discuss the impact of copper fill on the motor's electromagnetic performance."

In this case, the machine core air-gap flux density was evaluated to be 1.06 T.

                                "The air-gap side edges of the iron laminations experience saturation due to fringing effects at the copper and iron interface. This leads to higher eddy current losses in the yoke and thus an increase in the yoke temperature. To study eddy currents at the lamination level, a 3D FEA model was setup with an iron lamination thickness of 0.01\" and copper lamination thickness of 0.005\" [15][16][17]. Eddy currents were evaluated by modeling one of each lamination, corresponding to a 33% copper stacking factor design. In radial flux motors significant eddy currents are generated in the axial direction of the core due to the radial flux lines between the rotor and stator. However, due to the fringing effect in the proposed design, flux can leak into the copper sheet as shown Fig. 10, thus generating eddy currents with a non-zero radial component. This is exaggerated near points of saturation. Due to this fringing impact, the peak eddy current density for the 16.6% copper lamination fill factor was evaluated to be 0.7 Arms/mm 2 and 2.3 Arms/mm 2 for a 33.3% copper stacking factor as shown in Fig. 11. These values are much smaller than the traditional current density limits of (17 Arms/mm 2 per copper). The total eddy current losses in the core are negligible compared to the iron losses: 0.1 W at 20.0% copper stacking factor and 2.0 W at 33.3% copper stacking factor. Therefore, a 20% copper lamination stack factor was chosen for prototype development as it does not generate significant eddy current loss or a significant reduction in torque production."

Waterjet cutting has minimal vibration and therefore presents the lowest risk of crack growth. The relatively higher in-plane than through-plane thermal conductivity of AlN means this method also maximizes the material performance. The thickest available AlN material (7 mm) was sourced to minimize the number of machining operations. Several test arrays with varying fin thicknesses were cut to calibrate the waterjet and determine minimum achievable dimensions. A minimum successful fin thickness of 0.015\" was achieved with no significant taper using a non-articulated waterjet head. However, final fin and base thicknesses of 0.030\" were chosen in consideration of thermal trade-offs discussed in Section III.C and to provide structural margin.

The copper laminations were made from 0.005\" thick Copper 110 alloy foil that was folded, compressed, and cut to the correct geometry via wire EDM. To achieve 20% copper fill in the lamination stack, one copper lamination was periodically placed for every two HF-10 laminations. Both sets of laminations were coated with EB-548 bonding epoxy prior to curing, however, the copper laminations also required a surface preparation.

The heat load was applied to the inner surface of each test article at T=0 s. A snapshot of the results after roughly 8.5 minutes is shown in Fig. 14 (b).
