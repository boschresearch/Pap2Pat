    "title": "An Improved Inactivated Influenza Vaccine with Enhanced Cross Protection",
    "date": "2018-08-09",
    "abstract": "Current inactivated influenza vaccines are strain-specific and poorly effective against variant or mismatched viruses. They are standardized based on their hemagglutinin (HA) or ability to induce strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies. The HA is known to undergo major conformational changes when exposed to the low pH environment of endosomes (pH5.0 and 37oC), which are required for membrane fusion during virus cell entry. In an effort to improve these vaccines, influenza antigens treated under various low pH conditions were evaluated for increased cross-reactive antibody response and cross protection. It was found that a full range of structural and antigenic changes in HA could be induced by varying low pH treatment conditions from the mild (low pH at \u226425oC) to the strong (low pH at \u226537oC) as determined by analysis of potency, HA morphology, protease sensitivity, and reactivity with an anti-HA2 domain (CD) antibody. Inactivated antigens of both H1N1 and H3N2 strains treated at mild low pH conditions (0-25oC) exhibited only moderate HA structural and antigenic changes and markedly increased antibody response against HA2, the highly conserved part of HA, and cross protection against heterologous challenge in mice by up to 30% in survival. In contrast, antigen treated with low pH at 37oC showed more extensive structural and antigenic changes, and induced much less of an increase in antibody response against HA2, but a greater increase with response against HA1, and did not provide any increased cross protection. These results suggest that the increased response against HA2 obtained with the mild low pH treatment is associated with the increased cross protection. These antigens treated at the mild low pH conditions remained capable of inducing a high level of strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies. Thus, they could readily be formulated as an inactivated influenza vaccine which not only provides the same strain-specific protection, but also an increased cross protection against heterologous viruses. Such a vaccine could be particularly beneficial in cases of vaccine mismatch.",

                "Current inactivated influenza vaccines, either trivalent or quadrivalent (TIV or QIV; H1N1, H3N2, and one or two B strains), are strain-specific and poorly effective against variant or mismatched viruses. They are only moderately effective against seasonal influenza with an efficacy of 59% in adults aged 18\u201365 as shown by meta-analysis of clinical studies over several influenza seasons (1). Their effectiveness can decrease significantly with mismatched viruses and be as low as 19% as recently occurred in the 2014\u20132015 season (2, 3). Such vaccine mismatch still occurs frequently despite an annual vaccine strain exchange intended to match the circulating viruses. It also occurred in the current influenza season (2017\u20132018) with an interim estimated vaccine effectiveness of 36% (3). This underscores the fact that influenza viruses undergo constant genetic and antigenic changes and highlights the urgent need to develop better vaccines with a broader spectrum of protection (4, 5). Toward this goal, a strategic plan for developing a universal influenza vaccine was recently published by NIAID of NIH (6).",
                "The hemagglutinin (HA) is the protective antigen in inactivated influenza vaccines (7). These vaccines are standardized based on specific amount of HA protein or potency as measured by the single radial diffusion (SRD) assay (8). They induce strain-specific antibody responses as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization. A HAI titer of 1:40 is considered protective in humans. The HA is a trimeric protein made of three identical subunits. Each subunit consists of two parts, HA1 and HA2. The HA1 constitutes the globular head of HA and is the major target of immune responses. It contains the cell receptor binding site and is therefore the basis for hemagglutination activity and HAI assay. It is highly variable, which is the primary cause of vaccine mismatch. On the other hand, HA2 makes up the bulk of HA stem and is less immunogenic, but highly conserved within subtype or closely related subtypes (9). It consists of several distinct domains including fusion peptide and C and D helixes or the long alpha helix (LAH) (10). During cell entry, the virus is taken up into endosomes following receptor binding where the HA is exposed to the low pH environment within the endosome (~pH 5 at 37\u00b0C). Under this low pH condition, HA undergoes drastic conformational changes including dissociation of the HA1 globular head and refolding and rising of the HA2 (11, 12). These conformational changes facilitate the membrane fusion and subsequent delivery of the viral genome into the cell cytoplasm.",
                "The HA2, being highly conserved, has been a major target for the development of a broad-spectrum or universal influenza vaccine. It forms the central part of HA stem. The current inactivated vaccines induce only a minimal level of anti-HA2 or HA stem antibodies (13). This is consistent with HA stem being masked by the HA1 globular head. However, antibodies induced against the HA stem, either neutralizing or non-neutralizing, can be broadly protective (13\u201316). The non-neutralizing antibodies against conserved domains have been increasingly recognized to play a significant role in cross protection via the antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) (15\u201317). Various approaches are being evaluated to enhance immune responses against HA2 or HA stem, including chimeric HA (18), HA stem constructs (19\u201321), and selected HA2 domains including the CD or LAH (22, 23). Based on exposure of the HA2 at low pH, inactivated antigens treated at pH 5.0 and 37\u00b0C have also been evaluated, but found to be incapable of inducing any increased cross-reactive antibody responses or increased cross protection (24).",
                "To further evaluate the potential of low pH-treated antigens for increased cross-reactive immune response and cross protection, we treated the antigens in a wide range of low pH conditions, characterizes them based on different antigenic and structural parameters (antigenicity, morphology, protease sensitivity and reactivity with an anti-CD antibody), and evaluated the antigens generated under different low pH conditions for immunogenicity and protection in mice. It was found that it was the antigens treated under the mild low pH conditions (at \u226425\u00b0C), but not that treated at the strong low pH condition (37\u00b0C) that could induce increased antibody response against HA2 and cross protection. These antigens exhibited only moderate structural changes in HA as compared to the one generated at the strong low pH condition (37\u00b0C). These results together potentially form the basis for an improved inactivated influenza vaccine with increased cross protection."

It is partially hidden in the normal HA conformation, but refolded and fully exposed when exposed to the low pH environment within endosomes (~pH 5.0 and 37\u00b0C) (11, 12). To further characterize low pH-induced HA structural changes, an anti-CD polyclonal antibody was used to react with treated influenza antigens. This specific antibody was generated in mice using the CD domain (H1 consensus) fused to a nanoparticle carrier protein (23). It has been shown to be protective against lethal challenge (23), thus confirming its ability in recognizing corresponding domains in native antigens.",

The antibody was used at a high dilution (\u22652,000) to limit the reaction level with the control or untreated antigens. A ~2-fold increase in the reaction was observed with the antigen treated at 0\u00b0C as compared to the untreated antigen, while the highest level of reaction was obtained with antigen treated at 37\u00b0C (>4-fold) (Figure 4A).",

The maximum level of reaction likely represented the full CD exposure or HA structural changes (11, 12). Thus, extent of the structural changes at various different conditions can be assessed against this maximum level of reaction for a given antigen (% maximum reaction). These results were obtained with both H1N1 NC IWV (Figure 4B) and a TIV (2011\u20132012) which contains the 2009 H1N1 strain (Figure 4C). In addition, this analysis could be performed with antigens coated on the plate and on-plate low pH treatment (Figures 4B,C), suggesting that this anti-CD ELISA could be a simple assay for evaluation of the low pH sensitivity of influenza antigens in a quick manner.",

This suggests that the antigenic or structural changes are not only quantitative but also qualitative under different low pH treatment conditions. Importantly, the increased reaction with HA2 also occurred with the heterologous antigen (H1N1 PR8) (Figure 5C). Together, these results suggested that antigens treated at low pH can induce increased antibody responses against HA2 of both homologous and heterologous strains, but a greater level of such antibody response could be obtained with those treated at mild low pH conditions (0 and 25\u00b0C) as compared to the strong low pH condition (37\u00b0C) (Figures 5C,D; Table 1).

These results were further confirmed with recombinant HA antigens. The recombinant HAs were first treated with trypsin to generate HA2 (28) before the immunoblot analysis. The results showed that the treated antigen also increased the antibody reaction with HA2 of all three recombinant HAs tested (H1N1 CA, H2N2 SG, and H5N1 VN) as compared to the untreated antigen (Figures 7C,D). This is consistent with the fact that H1, H2, and H5 subtypes are all in the same phylogenetic clade.

                "Currently available inactivated influenza vaccines are poorly effective against variant or mismatched viruses. The studies described here suggest a potential highly practical approach to improve these vaccines by increasing their ability to cross protect against mismatched viruses. This approach is based on the finding that antigens treated at mild low pH conditions can induce a higher level of antibody response against the more conserved HA2 and enhance cross protection against challenge by heterologous or mismatched viruses.",
                "The HA is one of the best studied viral membrane proteins. Exposure to the low pH environment within endosomes (~pH 5.0, 37\u00b0C) causes drastic conformational changes in the HA which are required for membrane fusion during viral cell entry (10, 12, 29). These changes include the disassociation of HA1 and refolding and rising of HA2, such that it bears little conformational resemblance to its native or original structure. Thus, antibodies generated against such changed antigens are likely not or less protective against virus bearing native HA as it is only the immune response against the native structure that could be highly protective. This is consistent with the observation that antigens treated at such strong condition (~pH 5.0 and 37\u00b0C) are incapable of generating any enhanced cross protection (ECP) even though the refolded HA2 is fully exposed as shown in the present studies as well as by others (24). By contrast, treatment at mild low pH conditions (low pH and \u226425\u00b0C) likely caused only moderate structural changes which include increased exposure of HA2, but in its more native conformation without refolding. This is supported by moderately increased reaction with anti-CD antibody and EM showing that the HA spike, although less well defined, remained upright. Thus, the resulting enhanced antibody response against HA2 could be reactive with native antigens and therefore protective. This suggested mechanism for the ECP by antigens treated at mild low pH conditions is schematically presented in Figure 8.",
                "The enhanced antibody response against HA2 by antigens treated at mild low pH conditions was clearly demonstrated by immunoblot in the present studies. This suggests that the linear epitopes on HA2 are likely involved. Antibodies specific to linear epitopes on HA can be highly protective as shown with monoclonal antibodies (30). Cross reactivity based on such epitope is likely more closely associated with amino acid sequence homology. On the other hand, no major increase in cross neutralization was induced by these antigens. Thus, these anti-HA2 antibodies are likely not strongly neutralizing and could mainly confer the ECP through ADCC. This is consistent with previous studies showing that non-neutralizing antibodies against HA stem are capable of protection against influenza via ADCC (15\u201317). In addition, inhibition of virus release could be another mechanism of protection by such antibodies (31).",
                "It appears that enhanced cross-reaction and protection could be obtained at most mild low pH conditions including those causing no apparent loss of potency. However, the largest increase in cross protection was obtained under the conditions yielding a potency loss of ~50%. This was observed with both H1N1 and H3N2 antigens. The treated antigens with a ~50% potency loss remained capable of generating a high HAI titer with no or \u22642-fold reduction as compared to the untreated antigens. The specific condition (pH and temperature) used to obtain the optimal antigenic and structural changes can be readily identified for a given virus strain by a simple screening of the treatment conditions. This can be facilitated by the anti-CD ELISA which yields results in direct correlation with SRD and is simpler and quicker to perform. It could also be performed using on-plate low pH treatment of coated antigens. As the CD or HA2 is well conserved within a subtype, the polyclonal antibody specific to CD domain of subtype consensus sequence can cross-react well with individual strains within the subtype as shown in the present study, making it more advantageous than a monoclonal antibody for such analysis. This anti-CD ELISA could potentially also lend itself for evaluation of inactivated vaccines and individual viruses for HA structural integrity and acid sensitivity.",
                "The antigens treated under the mild low pH conditions could therefore be used in an improved influenza vaccine with ECP. They could readily be formulated as the final vaccine to meet the potency standard with incorporation of additional treated or untreated antigens as necessary. The use of any additional antigens is likely well within the safety margin as there are already licensed high-dose inactivated influenza vaccines which contain four times the amount of the antigen used in the regular vaccines. It could also be formulated with an adjuvant without need for any additional antigen. For current inactivated vaccines, their potency (\u226515\u2009\u03bcg HA for each strain) as measured by SRD is correlated with the strain-specific HAI antibody titer and protection. A HAI titer of 1:40 is considered protective in humans. Thus, the improved vaccine with antigens treated at mild low pH conditions may not only provide strain-specific protection (the original vaccine indication) but also ECP. This improvement of the vaccine effectiveness could translate into significant reduction in influenza disease burden which could amount up to 35 million cases annually in the US alone (32, 33). This could be particularly true in light of that the effectiveness of current inactivated vaccines could be very poor or as low as 19% in recent years due largely to appearance of mismatched viruses (3). Incorporation of a low pH treatment step into vaccine manufacturing involves only use of simple acid and base for pH adjustment which does not introduce any impurities and can be performed without any major change of the manufacturing process.",
                "It is known that the HA1, where the receptor binding site is located, is primarily responsible for inducing strain-specific HAI antibodies. It is highly variable as compared to the more conserved HA2. Thus, the improved vaccine with antigens treated at mild low pH conditions takes advantage of a more balanced use of HA1 and HA2 by combining the strain-specific immune responses mediated by HA1 with cross-reactive immune responses provided by HA2. It is particularly well suited as a TIV or QIV since an even broader cross-reaction and protection could be obtained by incorporating treated antigens from both H1 and H3 subtypes. Such cross protection might possibly be extended to viruses from closely related subtypes."
