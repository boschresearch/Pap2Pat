                        "Bone tissue defects result in the need for more than two million bone graft interventions worldwide annually (with over 500,000 of these being required in the US alone, at a cost of over $2.5 billion). As daunting as these figures appear they are expected to double within the next several years, exacerbated by an increasingly aged and obese population. Common defects requiring surgical intervention span from simple fractures (suffering from non-union or delayed-union complications) to mass resection of bone tissue as a result of malignant tumor formation. Furthermore, bone grafts are often implemented alongside implanted devices, as a means to aid in their incorporation and mitigate the risk of immune rejection thereof. Such high demand, coupled with the low supply and complications associated with traditional graft sources necessitate the need for alternative graft sources.",
                        "Bone tissue engineering seeks to overcome the shortcomings of current bone graft sources via the production of constructs with enhanced osteogenicity, osteoconductivity, and osteoinductivity all while reducing the risks of graft rejection, disease transmission, and donor site morbidity.",
                        "However, as promising as bone tissue engineered grafts have proven in numerous animal models, there currently exist no products on the market for human clinical intervention due to FDA regulatory demands. Perhaps the biggest impediment to securing FDA approval of bone tissue engineered products is the requirement for the development of a robust program of quality control, necessitating sound methods for the real-time, non-destructive monitoring of such grafts in vitro prior to implantation. In fact, this is one of the main funding thrusts of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering in the field of tissue engineering.",
                        "Limited studies have addressed the concern of construct monitoring, though it is clear this is necessary for the advancement and clinical implementation of bone tissue engineering approaches. Many groups have investigated the use of biosensors for the monitoring of metabolites within cell culture media, though typically only as a means of modelling gradients or comparing responses to treatments. Some groups have gone so far as to predict cellularity from metabolic flux data, though only for non-differentiating cells with stable metabolism. A method in which cellularity and maturation (defined as differentiation and mineralization) of bone tissue constructs could be determined would be a significant advancement in the field."

                        "An ever-increasing demand for bone grafts necessitates the realization of clinical implementation of bone tissue engineered (BTE) constructs (also referred to herein as bone constructs). However, due to the lack of viable methods for the rigorous monitoring of the status of BTE constructs, the securing of FDA approval continues to be a predominant hurdle to implementation. The present disclosure sets forth, in at least one embodiment, a method for such monitoring based on the shifting metabolism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as they differentiate into osteoblasts in a BTE construct. The method comprises the real-time, non-destructive monitoring of a BTE construct cultured in vitro, to determine when the construct has matured. The method is based on the utilization of key metabolic rates, oxygen uptake and glucose consumption.",

                        "Returning to discussion of particular embodiments of the present disclosure, within biomedical engineering, the field of tissue engineering primarily addresses shortcomings in tissue damage repair and organ transplants. By developing techniques for in vitro tissue culture and development, tissue engineering presents solutions to tissue damage-related problems which are unavailable to purely in vivo treatments. In many cases, treatment for tissue damage involves direct autologous transplant of a similar tissue from another region within the body. This approach repairs critically damaged tissue at the cost of tissue strength and integrity from the donor site. The tissue engineering approach instead extracts adult stem cells from the host nondestructively. These cells are then cultured in vitro with scaffolding, media, and flow stresses which mimic an in vivo environment, allowing the stem cells to proliferate and then differentiate into cell types which effect the desired tissue. Once properly developed, the tissue matrix is reinserted at the location requiring tissue repair, providing both material to provide support and cells optimized to mend the damaged tissue.",
                        "Bone tissue engineering utilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow extract to produce osteoblasts, a key component in bone development and maintenance. Osteoblastic tissue constructs developed in vitro will be used as grafts for delayed union or nonunion bone fractures. Currently, about 1 million delayed union or nonunion fractures occur in the U.S. each year. Standard treatment for these conditions involve an autologous bone graft, usually bone material removed from the hip. This method creates significant risk of morbidity and infection at the donor site as well as reducing the mechanical integrity of the hip bone. Development of a similar graft from MSCs would circumvent these complications.",
                        "The properties of the scaffold which supports the stem cells play a significant role in cell growth and differentiation and tissue development. As the supporting structure, the scaffold needs an appropriate degree of rigidity for the target tissue. Bone tissue in particular requires rigid scaffolding. Additionally, scaffolding requires porosity or maximal surface area for nutrient transfer and cell expansion. Scaffolds should also promote cell adhesion or they would not be viable surfaces for cell culture. When exposed to the tissue's native conditions, the scaffold should degrade at a rate similar to tissue development into a non-toxic product.",
                        "Scaffolds are a necessity for supporting cells in in vitro applications of tissue engineering. For bone tissue engineering, the scaffold must allow the cells to not only attach and proliferate, but must also allow for mechanical stimulation, encourage bone cell migration, act as a substrate for osteoid deposition, and deliver bioactive molecules. Another aspect that is desired is biodegradability. If a tissue engineered construct is put into the body, the scaffold must degrade over time leaving only organic material that will retain natural levels of mechanical strength. The common scaffold types used for bone growth are natural polymers (fibrin and collagen), synthetic polymers (polycarbonates, polyanhidrides, poly(ethylene oxide), polyfumarates, and polyphosphazene), metals and ceramics. Examples of biodegradable polymers which have been used include poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA).",

The term \u201costeogenic differentiation media\u201d (ODM) may be used interchangeably herein with osteogenic induction media. OIM differs from regular culture media (e.g., \u03b1-MEM) in that it contains dexamethasone, beta-glycerophosphate, and ascorbic acid. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that has been found to facilitate bone differentiation and mineralization in cultures. Beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid roles are to provide phosphate and increase collagen fibril production, respectively. The OIM may also include growth factors to aid in osteogenic differentiation. For example, non-limiting examples of such growth factors include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2 to BMP-14), such as BMP-2 and BMP-7, are osteoinductive growth factors that are commonly used as growth factors to enhance mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts and may optionally be included in the OIM. BMP-2 is an important growth factor as it is involved in the TGF beta-signaling pathway, and aids in osteogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. Osteogenic peptides derived from the BMPs may be used as well, for example as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 8,066,980. Non-limiting examples of OIMs (i.e., ODMs) that may be used herein include, but are not limited to, those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,334,481; 9,339,520; 9,597,359; 9,808,558; and 9,814,803. Once the cells are ready to be used, they must be seeded onto the scaffolds. Although the procedure may vary, static and dynamic seeding are the two most commonly used seeding methods. Static seeding consists of injecting cells onto scaffolds that are sitting in a culture well plate. In dynamic seeding, the cells suspended in media are allowed to flow through the scaffold. In theory, this allows for a greater level of cell penetration.",
                        "Perfusion bioreactors have been shown to be the most effective systems for bone tissue engineering, and it has been found that they deliver a wide range of easily manipulated shear stresses to stimulate differentiation into bone cells. They usually comprise a pump, media reservoirs, scaffold chambers, and connecting tubes. There are two main types of perfusion bioreactors: scaffold perfusion, and perfusion column. Perfusion columns have space surrounding the scaffolds, through which the media can flow. By doing this, media is not required to flow throughout the scaffold and therefore the shear stresses are not as easily controlled, and nutrient delivery is lowered through the interior porosity of the scaffolds. Scaffold perfusion bioreactors give better control of shear stresses by flowing media directly through the scaffolds. This is accomplished by press-fitting the scaffold in a cassette that restricts fluid flow only through the pores of the scaffold. Assuming pore interconnectivity throughout the scaffold, fluid flow provides enhanced nutrient delivery to cells residing in all locations of the construct, and allow for better waste removal as well.",
                        "The main benefit for utilizing dynamic bioreactor culture is the mitigation of mass transport limitations. During extended culture, it is necessary to continually supply the cells with nutrients, such as oxygen and glucose, for them to continue to proliferate and differentiate. In static culture without media flow, nutrients are transported to the cells in the interior of the scaffold mainly by passive diffusion. Previous studies have shown that tissues above 600 \u03bcm suffer from large hypoxic areas. Therefore, only cells located near the periphery of the scaffold will have the nutrients required to proliferate. In order to culture constructs of clinically relevant size, it is necessary for bone tissue engineers to develop culture techniques that improve these undesirable nutrient gradients by adding convective mass transfer.",
                        "Perfusion bioreactors provide enhanced mass transport benefits. Due to the press fit cassettes, media is not only continuously supplied to the scaffold, but it also forced exclusively through the interior of the scaffold. By doing this, the nutrient gradient is mitigated, thus allowing cells to proliferate without experiencing severe hypoxic conditions. In addition to this, the unidirectional flow allows for continual waste removal from the scaffold. Examples of perfusions bioreactors which may be used in certain embodiments of the present disclosure include but are not limited to those shown in PCT application PCT/US2018/41972, published US patent applications 2011/0229970, 2012/0035742, 2016/0201037, 2016/0282338, 2016/0324642, and U.S. Pat. No. 8,367,059.",
                        "In the body, fluid flow induced shear forces give signals to mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate. As a force is applied to the bone, a pressure change occurs which leads to fluid flow inside the lacunae and canaliculi, leading to a signal transduction pathway resulting in these stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. In in vitro environments, previous research has shown shear stresses below 15 dynes/cm2 to have a stimulatory effect promoting osteoblastic differentiation, matrix deposition and calcification, cell proliferation, and osteogenic gene expression in 3D constructs. Osteoblastic differentiation is more pronounced in scaffold perfusion systems. Due to media being forced through the interior of the scaffold, the average flow induced shear forces are more controllable and more evenly distributed throughout the scaffold.",
                        "Cell seeding is the first step in the development of in vitro bone tissue engineered constructs. Before a tissue can be grown, it is necessary to adhere cells to the surface of the scaffold, so that they may proliferate throughout the construct. In most cases, it is preferable to have a homogeneous seeding distribution so that the tissue can grow evenly across the entirety of the scaffold surface area. This is especially true in bone tissue engineering, where the cells must not only proliferate, but also deposit mineralized tissue. In terms of cellular adherence, this is measured in seeding efficiency, which is the number of cells adhered at the end of a seeding protocol in comparison to the number of cells that were initially placed on the construct.",
                        "In light of the aforementioned goals, static seeding is largely unsuitable. In static seeding, cells are suspended in media and either pipetted onto the surface of the scaffold or the scaffold is placed into the suspension. There are many techniques employed, such as vacuum evacuation or shaker plates, to induce cellular migration to the interior of the scaffold; however, the results suffer from inconsistencies and more often than usual demonstrate extended inhomogeneities that are clearly undesirable. Similar to the mass transport limitations that plague static cultures, cells to inhabit the periphery of the scaffold leading to nonhomogeneous tissue development.",
                        "In dynamic seeding, the cells are added to media, and fluid flow is utilized in the bioreactor system to help the cells navigate to the scaffold surface and potentially to the interior. The addition of flow produces higher seeding efficiency and a more homogenous cell distribution. Although each of the discussed dynamic bioreactor designs may be used to accomplish this, the perfusion bioreactor is once again more efficient at completing this task. Oscillatory seeding comprises adding the cells to the media and then using a flow perfusion system to alternate the flow direction making sure that the residence time is adequate to permit cells to fully travel through the scaffold before flow direction is changed. By doing this, cells are forced back and forth, through the interior of the scaffold many times over. Using this method, seeding efficiencies are increased even more so than with unidirectional flow.",
                        "In at least one example of the work shown below, rat MSCs were seeded on porous spunbonded PLLA scaffolds. The seeded scaffolds were cultured in flow perfusion bioreactors with baseline or osteoinductive media, and levels of key physio-metabolic markers (oxygen, glucose, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin) were monitored throughout culture. Comparison of these non-destructively obtained values and current standard destructive analyses demonstrated key trends useful for the concurrent real-time monitoring of construct cellularity and maturation. Principle among these was the elucidation of the ratio of the rates of oxygen uptake to glucose consumption as a powerful quality marker. This ratio, supported on a physiological basis, has been demonstrated herein to be a reliable marker in the determination of both construct maturation (defined as osteoblastic differentiation and accompanying mineralization) and construct cellularity. Supplementary monitoring of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (OCN) are shown to provide further validation of such metrics."

Furthermore, the same figure demonstrates that the MEM group (cultured in basal media) does not show signs of osteo-maturation based on maintenance of steady ALP activity at basal levels and no significant increase in deposited calcium. Lower values of cellularity observed for the MEM group as compared with the Osteo group is potentially the result of decreased attachment potential of non-differentiating MSCs to an osteoconductive scaffold as compared with their osteo-differentiating counterparts.",

This distinction acknowledges the potential for non-zero-order kinetics (with respect to the species of interest) for each metabolic rate (i.e. the cell-specific rate of oxygen uptake may indeed be a function of the local concentration of oxygen). Based on the nature of the flow perfusion profile, gradients in the concentration of each species are inevitable, which could lead to variations in cell-specific metabolic rates. Furthermore, differences in differentiation status among cells within a construct could result in such variations as well. These effects were mitigated within the experiments detailed herein by the small concentration gradients (in space or time) resulting from the low cellularities employed.",

Indeed, this is a trend supported in the literature for the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. Much higher rates of oxygen uptake and glucose consumption are reported herein as compared with the literature (Table 1). A possible explanation of this discrepancy is the nature of the quantification of these values present in the literature wherein large quantities of cells were cultured in stagnant 2D flasks.

Indeed, higher sustained rates of OPG production were observed for the Osteo group as compared with the MEM group. Higher initial values of OPG production (at Day 1) in both groups are thought to be an artifact of cellular acclimation to a new environment. Resulting values of cell-specific OPG production rates are presented in Table 1. It is notable that, as a regulatory signaling molecule, production rates of OPG are highly likely to be dependent on local concentrations (in addition to other environmental cues).

                        "As noted, the ratio of the microscopic (i.e. cell-specific) rates of oxygen uptake to glucose consumption matches the ratio of the macroscopic (i.e. construct-specific) rates; in other words qO2,avg/qglc,avg=OUR/GCR. Though this equality may seem trivial, the functional impact is profound. This comes down to the fact that calculation of the former (microscopic rates) requires precise knowledge of the number of cells within a construct (a difficult task to achieve non-destructively in a 3D construct). Calculation of the later (macroscopic rates); however, is achieved much more easily, simply requiring measurement of a change in concentration (over space or time). Indeed, it is the power afforded by the utilization of a ratio of macroscopic rates (i.e., OUR/GCR) which circumvents the necessity of knowing the cellularity.",
                        "The correlation in time between the divergence (of the Osteo group from the MEM baseline) of the OUR/GCR ratio and the divergences of ALP activity and calcium deposition first suggested the potential of said ratio as a metric for construct quality (FIG. 3). This finding was reinforced by a physiological basis for said use wherein the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts is accompanied by a shift in metabolism (as described above). Further analysis of the correlation between the osteo-maturation markers (ALP activity and calcium deposition) and OUR/GCR revealed the existence of a threshold value in OUR/GCR of approximately 2.0 mol O2/mol glucose. Values above 2.0 mol O2/mol glucose correspond to mature/differentiating BTE constructs whereas values below 2.0 mol O2/mol glucose correspond to immature/undifferentiated constructs (FIG. 4).",
                        "Beyond the degree of maturation, the cellularity of a BTE construct is another aspect of its quality. As such, a good quality monitoring methodology must be able to estimate a construct's cellularity non-destructively as well. Although rates of oxygen, glucose, and other metabolites have been used previously by many labs to predict cellularity non-destructively, these analyses have only been employed for non-differentiating cells with unchanging metabolic profile. In order to accommodate shifting metabolic profiles, the approach employed herein was to develop correlations for the cell-specific rates of oxygen uptake and glucose consumption as functions of OUR/GCR and use these alongside their construct-specific counterparts as a means to predict construct cellularity. Said correlations were determined to be well approximated by linear regressions (Eqns. 5 and 6). The resulting positive slope for the regression of qO2,avg as a function of OUR/GCR demonstrates an increase in cellular oxygen uptake accompanying osteoblastic differentiation whereas the negative slope for that of qglc,avg as a function of OUR/GCR demonstrates a decrease in cellular glucose consumption accompanying said differentiation. These together suggest a metabolic shift as the immature MSCs, exhibiting a glycolytically-dominated metabolism, differentiate into osteoblasts benefiting more from oxidative phosphorylation for energy production.",
                        "Utilizing the regressions derived for the cell-specific oxygen uptake and glucose consumption rates along with their construct-specific rate counterparts, the cellularity of constructs was able to be determined (Eqns. 7 and 8). Comparison of these predicted values with those determined experimentally revealed the predictive capability of such approach (exhibiting r2 values near 0.80). Furthermore, good confidence in said predicted values was observed (to within 20% of the experimentally-determined values). The implications of these results suggest that simple measurement of the oxygen uptake and glucose consumption rates of each construct can be used to determine the cellularity thereof during differentiation and maturation, a method previously unreported in the literature.",
                        "The presently disclosed results demonstrate the ability of a simple means for the real-time, non-destructive monitoring of both the cellularity and maturation (including differentiation and mineralization) of bone tissue engineered constructs cultured in vitro based on the measurement of macro-scale oxygen and glucose concentrations. The use of the ratio of the construct-specific rates of oxygen uptake and glucose consumption has been proposed as a viable method for such determination, and said use is supported on a physiological basis. Furthermore, monitoring of the production rates of osteoprotegerin and osteocalcin (as measured in circulating culture media) is comprises a supplementary method for the monitoring of early-stage (in the case of OPG) and late-stage (in the case of OCN) osteoblastic maturation of a construct. These metrics are easily implemented, and readily usable as a method of quality control and determination of optimal implant timing. The principles established herein could easily be adapted for the monitoring of tissue engineered constructs other than bone, such as cartilage, with the substitution of any of the markers utilized herein with those more relevant to the changing physio-metabolic profile of the cells of choice."
