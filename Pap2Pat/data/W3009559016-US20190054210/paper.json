    "title": "Effects of Flow Rate on Mesenchymal Stem Cell Oxygen Consumption Rates in 3D Bone-Tissue-Engineered Constructs Cultured in Perfusion Bioreactor Systems",
    "date": "2020-03-08",
    "abstract": "Bone grafts represent a multibillion-dollar industry, with over a million grafts occurring each year. Common graft types are associated with issues such as donor site morbidity in autologous grafts and immunological response in allogenic grafts. Bone-tissue-engineered constructs are a logical approach to combat the issues commonly encountered with these bone grafting techniques. When creating bone-tissue-engineered constructs, monitoring systems are required to determine construct characteristics, such as cellularity and cell type. This study aims to expand on the current predictive metrics for these characteristics, specifically analyzing the effects of media flow rate on oxygen uptake rates (OURs) of mesenchymal stem cells seeded on poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds cultured in a flow perfusion bioreactor. To do this, oxygen consumption rates were measured for cell/scaffold constructs at varying flow rates ranging from 150 to 750 microliters per minute. Residence time analyses were performed for this bioreactor at these flow rates. Average observed oxygen uptake rates of stem cells in perfusion bioreactors were shown to increase with increased oxygen availability at higher flow rates. The residence time analysis helped identify potential pitfalls in current bioreactor designs, such as the presence of channeling. Furthermore, this analysis shows that oxygen uptake rates have a strong linear correlation with residence times of media in the bioreactor setup, where cells were seen to exhibit a maximum oxygen uptake rate of 3 picomoles O2/hr/cell.",

                "Current challenges in tissue engineering include finding reproducible means to create tissue-engineered constructs that are viable for transplants into humans. Existing methodologies require the destruction of constructs to determine their characteristics, such as cellularity and the development of extracellular matrices and cell phenotypes. The absence of appropriate predictive models has delayed the progress of tissue-engineered products from benchtop to market. While many solutions exist to determine characteristics in 2D systems, 3D systems lack predictive models that can accurately and consistently describe the important factors that will ultimately bring tissue-engineered bone constructs to a large-scale production. For perfusion bioreactor systems, several indicators of metabolic activity have shown predictive power, such as glucose consumption and oxygen consumption [1].",
                "Fluids 2020, 5, 30 2 of 14 Oxygen monitoring as an indicator of metabolic activity, cell proliferation, and culture progression is a promising method for the on-line measurement of tissue-engineered construct characteristics. Many 3D perfusion systems use a fluorescent material to monitor oxygen entering and exiting the construct [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Flow perfusion systems that measure oxygen uptake have successfully measured metabolic activity and cell proliferation in a 3D construct, allowing for the non-destructive monitoring of cells in vitro [3,5,7]. As cells differentiate, they have been shown to change metabolic pathways, often resulting in altered oxygen uptake rates (OURs). Oxygen monitoring in conjunction with other on-line monitoring systems can account for these changes and predict the onset and/or progression of differentiation [1]. However, it is important to first characterize additional factors that could alter oxygen uptake rate, such as flow rate and scaffold geometry.",
                "In the broadest sense, oxygen uptake rates by cells depends on oxygen availability. For 2D systems, where oxygen availability is mediated by linear diffusion through media, stem cell oxygen uptake rates have been shown to exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to oxygen concentrations [8]. In 3D static systems, oxygen availability is limited by diffusion alone, causing significant gradients for any system where cells are distributed throughout a 3D scaffold [9,10]. Three-dimensional flow perfusion bioreactors are associated with increased oxygen mass transfer rates (compared to static cultures) and mechanical stimulation due to the presence of shear forces. In these bioreactor designs, the media flows directly through the interconnected pores of a scaffold, mitigating most mass transport limitations [11][12][13]. The regulation of this mass transport phenomenon, alone, was found to improve control over cell behavior in larger tissue-engineered constructs [14,15]. Mechanical stimulation in the form of shear stress has been shown to have a positive effect on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts in systems where flow is present [11,14,16,17]. This combination of factors has led to flow perfusion bioreactors becoming the primary choice for bone-tissue-engineering applications.",
                "The indirect contribution of flow rate to oxygen uptake rate is often neglected when determining cell-specific models. Flow rate has the potential to change flow characteristics in the construct, thereby altering oxygen availability to the cells. Predictive models can be developed to determine the average observed cell oxygen uptake rate with respect to flow rate. Residence time of media in the construct is flow rate specific, and can potentially be used as a tool for cellularity and differentiation models to be expanded in order to address a variety of bioreactor and scaffold types. Since the residence time distribution analysis corresponds to the specific scaffold architecture and bioreactor design used, this study can serve as a methodology that can be adopted when alternative architectures are explored.",
                "We hypothesize that increasing the flow rate will yield an increase in the average observed cell-specific oxygen uptake rate due to the increased oxygen availability and diminished gradients in the direction of flow in the construct. Furthermore, changes in flow characteristics will likely alter the oxygen distribution in the construct, which will subsequently affect the average observed cell-specific oxygen uptake rate. Lastly, we hypothesize that we can associate the experimentally determined residence times found in this analysis to standard models found in literature. We can then use this comparable model as a means to efficiently determine the average observed cell-specific oxygen uptake rate for a particular flow rate without the need for additional studies to be conducted."

                "The average observed oxygen uptake rates for cells found in this experiment were an order of magnitude larger than those found in the literature. This could potentially be due to a multitude of factors. First, nearly all literature values obtained have been found in 2D systems, with maximum uptake rates of approximately 0.1 picomoles oxygen/cell/hour, compared to our findings of 3.02 \u00b1 0.07 picomoles oxygen/cell/hour [8,25]. However, the effects of dynamic versus static culturing systems have been shown to have a significant effect on the metabolic properties of mesenchymal stem cells in terms of glucose consumption [26]. These findings could be extrapolated to oxygen consumption, as well, since glucose and oxygen are the two primary indicators of metabolic rate. Additionally, cells could potentially have varying metabolic rates in high confluency environments in 2D systems, where many of these oxygen uptake rate values were observed. Our system had comparatively low confluency, potentially yielding higher net oxygen uptake rates.",
                "The overarching objective of this investigation was to determine a relationship between flow characteristics and the oxygen uptake rate of cells. Our results found a linear relationship between residence time and cell-specific oxygen uptake rates, and these results were consistent with findings of laminar flow characteristics in our system, where higher convective mass transfers of oxygen, associated with lower residence times, caused higher oxygen uptake rates. The theoretical values of mean residence time for fully developed laminar flow were consistently within the error for the experimental values found. Therefore, using the well described laminar flow model could be an option for those working with varying flow rates in this bioreactor type. Additionally, these correlations could be extrapolated using our model to determine a maximum oxygen uptake rate in conditions where there are no mass transport limitations, giving a potential maximum cell-specific oxygen uptake rate of approximately 4 picomoles/cell/hour. While these results may only be applicable in cases where no oxygen gradients are present, they provide insight to guide new bioreactor designs in terms of nutrient delivery to cells within a tissue-engineered construct. The predictive model could also serve as a corrective factor for other systems relying on on-line oxygen measurements to determine cellularity."
