Embodiments of the present disclosure identify a simplified text that includes original information from a complex text and additional information that is not in the complex text. Embodiments then compute an entailment score for each sentence of the simplified text using a neural network, wherein the entailment score indicates whether the sentence of the simplified text includes information from a sentence of the complex text corresponding to the sentence of the simplified text.

                        "Recently, NLP techniques have been used to convert complex texts into simplified texts. For example, some NLP techniques break up larger sentences into shorter sentences, and substitute complex (e.g., less commonly used) vocabulary for more common vocabulary. However, these simplification methods can generate content that wasn't in the original (i.e., hallucinations). For example, hallucinations can include new and or inconsistent information with respect to the original text. Such inconsistent information can carry significant consequences in areas such as legal documents and medical documents. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for systems and methods for text simplification that simplify text without hallucinations."

                        "The present disclosure describes systems and methods for simplifying text, removing hallucinations from the simplified text to produce a modified text, and presenting the modified text to a user. This allows a user to consume content from a complex text with reduced difficulty, while preventing the user from receiving incorrect, inconsistent, or redundant information.",
                        "Text simplification is the task of translating a complex piece of text into a simpler version that may be more easily read and understood by a reader. This can be helpful in enabling users in reading and consuming complex documents, such as legal contracts or medical documents. Text simplification methods are useful in many areas. For example, text simplification can be applied to legal contracts to assist users in understanding agreements they are party to. Text simplification can also be applied to any complex text, especially in areas that include a large amount of jargon, such as medical papers, legal papers, scientific papers, and the like.",
                        "Text simplification is useful in many domains. For example, text simplification can be applied to contract documents. Contracts are legal documents that are used in business workflows, and include employment agreements, licensing agreements, loan agreements, and so on. Prior to signing a contract, the parties involved read through the clauses contained in the contract to understand them and ensure the signees are aware of what they are agreeing to. Legal clauses can be lengthy and highly domain-specific. This can make the clauses difficult to read and understand for people without a legal background, which is often the case for small entities such as individuals or small businesses. Embodiments provided herein will be described in this legal context for better understanding, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and the embodiments may be applied to other domains as suggested above.",
                        "Many text simplification models are trained using datasets that are not suited to a target domain. For example, a text simplification model trained using a general language corpus may produce several hallucinations. The hallucinations may be related to the model's attempt to provide alternative meanings for a phrase to allow the user to better understand the phrase. However, the alternative meanings can be misleading or incorrect, especially when the trained model is applied to a domain that is different than its training dataset. There is currently a lack of availability in labelled domain-specific datasets, which results in text simplification models being prone to excessive hallucinations.",
                        "Some comparative systems attempt to address hallucinations by generating domain-specific training data. In some cases, the comparative systems generate synthetic data based on original data, where the synthetic data is altered to include labeled hallucinations. Then, the systems train simplification models to avoid these hallucinations. However, this uses significant time creating and training on the synthetic data, and the resulting models can still leave several residual hallucinations.",
                        "Some other comparative systems are designed specifically for the legal domain. For example, some process text from contract agreements in order to identify contractual elements. They are able to identify the main elements in a contract, and potentially compare them with other similar contracts to identify differences. When coupled with NLP techniques, these systems can generate concise summaries of contract documents. However, these summaries are intended only to outline the high level terms, and exclude many details. Further, they are designed for only legal contracts, and are not equipped to simplify text from other domains that include jargon such as medical, scientific, and others.",
                        "Accordingly, hallucinations and redundancies are expected in the output of the text simplification models. They may be reduced by identifying and removing inconsistent or redundant content from the output. For example, if there exists any detail or element in the simplified output text that does not entail any part of an input clause from the complex text, then it is factually inconsistent from the input.",
                        "The present disclosure describes systems and methods for generating modified text from a complex text, where the modified text includes minimal hallucinations. Embodiments include an algorithm based on textual entailment to reduce hallucinated and redundant text from outputs of a text simplification model. In some cases, the text simplification model is pre-trained in a supervised manner using an out-of-domain or generalized training set. In some cases, the text simplification model is trained in an unsupervised manner. In either case, embodiments described herein are configured to operate without domain-specific training data.",

Supervised learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is a machine learning technique based on learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. Supervised learning generates a function for predicting labeled data based on labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In some cases, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (i.e., a single value, or an output vector). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces the inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. In some cases, the learning results in a function that correctly determines the class labels for unseen instances. In other words, the learning algorithm generalizes from the training data to unseen examples. An embodiment of a text simplification model trained in a supervised manner will be described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 10.",

Unsupervised learning draws inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Unsupervised learning may be used to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. For example, cluster analysis is a form of unsupervised learning. Clusters may be identified using measures of similarity such as Euclidean or probabilistic distance. Self-supervised learning may be considered unsupervised learning, as self-supervised processes similarly do not involve supervised data. For example, a text simplification model that was trained in a self-supervised manner may generate a simplified text, then calculate a score for the generated text.

The modules comprise multi-head attention and feed forward layers. The inputs and outputs (target sentences) are first embedded into an n-dimensional space. Positional encoding of the different words (i.e., give every word/part in a sequence a relative position since the sequence depends on the order of its elements) are added to the embedded representation (n-dimensional vector) of each word.
