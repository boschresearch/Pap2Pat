    "abstract": "The present invention provides methods and systems for isotyping and quantification of antibodies based on immunocapture and/or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. These antibodies are induced by the administration of pharmaceutical products. The immunocapture method comprises contacting samples with a solid support, wherein the pharmaceutical product has been cross-linked directly to the solid support. The MS analysis includes conducting peptide mapping, selecting unique peptides and fragment ions to generate MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) transitions, optimizing collision energy, and determining a LLOQ (lower limit of quantification).",

FDA recommends adoption of a risk-based approach for evaluating and mitigating immune responses regarding adverse immunologically related responses associated with therapeutic protein products that affect their safety and efficacy. (Guidance for Industry: Immunogenicity Assessment for Therapeutic Protein Products, August 2014, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration)",

The highest frequency of reporting was for immunogenicity incidences. The clinical significance of ADAs was unknown. Overall, there was a striking concordance between an increase in systemic clearance of products and a reduction of efficacy associated with ADAs. (Wang et al., Evaluating and Reporting the Immunogenicity Impacts for Biological Products\u2014a Clinical Pharmacology Perspective. The AAPS Journal. 2016; 18(2): 395-403)",

Various ADAs which are capable of binding to different sites of the drugs can be present in patient's bodies, such as neutralizing or non-neutralizing ADAs. Neutralizing ADAs are capable of binding to the active site of the drug molecule, such as the binding site in drug molecule for binding to the drug target, or the variable regions of an antibody drug.

Relevant immunogenicity information includes the induction of binding antibodies, the induction of neutralizing antibodies, altered pharmacokinetics, reduced efficacy, and safety concerns. However, the clinical significance of ADAs was unknown. In addition, the limited available data may preclude a determination of the effect of ADAs. ADAs may associate with a concordance between an increase in systemic clearance of pharmaceutical products and a reduction of efficacy. Some drug products had drug-sustaining ADAs which resulted in a reduced clearance possibly due to the formation of ADA-drug complex, such as ADA binding of the drug.

In a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, a peptide sample is injected onto an LC coupled with a MS instrument. The first quadrupole can be used as a mass filter to isolate peptides with a targeted m/z. The second quadrupole serves as a collision cell to break the peptide into fragments. The third quadrupole serves as a second mass filter for specified m/z fragments from the initial parent peptide. As used herein, the term \u201ctandem mass spectrometry\u201d includes a technique where structural information on sample molecules can be obtained by using multiple stages of mass selection and mass separation. A prerequisite is that the sample molecules can be transferred into gas phase and ionized intact and that they can be induced to fall apart in some predictable and controllable fashion after the first mass selection step. Multistage MS/MS, or MSn, can be performed by first selecting and isolating a precursor ion (MS2), fragmenting it, isolating a primary fragment ion (MS3), fragmenting it, isolating a secondary fragment (MS4), and so on as long as one can obtain meaningful information or the fragment ion signal can be detectable. Tandem MS have been successfully performed with a wide variety of analyzer combinations. What analyzers to combine for a certain application can be determined by many different factors, such as sensitivity, selectivity, and speed, but also size, cost, and availability. The two major categories of tandem MS methods are tandem-in-space and tandem-in-time, but there are also hybrids where tandem-in-time analyzers are coupled in space or with tandem-in-space analyzers. A tandem-in-space mass spectrometer comprises an ion source, a precursor ion activation device, and at least two non-trapping mass analyzers. Specific m/z separation functions can be designed so that in one section of the instrument ions are selected, dissociated in an intermediate region, and the product ions are then transmitted to another analyzer for m/z separation and data acquisition. In tandem-in-time mass spectrometer ions produced in the ion source can be trapped, isolated, fragmented, and m/z separated in the same physical device.",

In order to select a suitable surrogate peptide for each antibody isotype, the surrogate peptide of each isotype should come from the constant region of the antibody. ADAs of the same isotype have different forms in terms of amino acid sequence in the variable regions, however they have the same constant region. In addition, the selected surrogate peptide is unique to each ADA isotype and should not be formed in any other isotypes. (Chen et al., Development of Immunocapture-LC/MS Assay for Simultaneous ADA Isotyping and Semiquantitation, Journal of Immunology Research, Volume 2016, Article ID 7682472, 14 pages) Furthermore, the surrogate peptides should not contain the amino acids of ADA allotype polymorphic residues (M.-P. Lefranc and G. Lefranc, Human Gm, Km, and Am allotypes and their molecular characterization: a remarkable demonstration of polymorphism, Methods in Molecular Biol-ogy, vol. 882, pp. 635-680, 2012).

Peptide sequences containing arginine-proline (RP) and lysine-proline (KP) are not preferable, since they are difficult to break down by digestion. The preferable peptide length is between 6 and 20 amino acids to minimize the number of ionization charge states, achieve efficient MS/MS fragmentation and high sensitivity, and obtain desirable chromatographic retention. It is also preferable to avoid peptide sequences containing glycosylation sites. (S. T. Wu, Z. Ouyang, T. V. Olah, and M.

Peptide separation was achieved with chromatography methods. The tryptic peptides with good LC-MS sensitivity were further evaluated. The specific peptides were identified by interpreting in silico tryptic peptides from each antibody isotype.

The preferred immunocapture and enzymatic digestion methods which were used to generate calibration curves for the determination of LLOQ include treating a serum sample containing ADAs with an acidic solution for acid dissociation of the components in serum, subsequently incubating the serum sample with a drug which was cross-linked directly to beads for immunocapture of ADAs, isolating the beads, washing the isolated beads with a washing solution, subsequently isolating ADAs from the beads with an elution solution, and subjecting the isolated ADAs to an enzymatic digestion to generate a combination of peptides. The combination of peptides were subjected to LC-MS analysis for isotyping and quantification of ADAs. The preferred immunocapture and enzymatic methods are outlined in FIG. 12 as an example.",
                                "As an example, the acid dissociation was performed by adding 50 \u03bcL of 600 mM acetic acid to 50 \u03bcL of a serum sample and incubating for 1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, the drug-beads were incubated with the serum samples at room temperature for 1 hour. As an example, 40 \u03bcL of 50 \u03bcg/mL of cross-linked drug was added to the serum sample which was diluted in 400 \u03bcL of 3% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in HBST buffer. Subsequently the beads were isolated. The isolated beads were washed with at least one washing solution at 0.5 mL, such as HBST buffer, and/or 3% BSA in HBST buffer. Subsequently the ADAs were isolated from the beads with an elution solution. As an example, 200 \u03bcL of elution solution, e.g., 0.1% formic acid/50% acetonitrile, was used to elude the ADAs from the beads. The isolated ADAs were dried down, such as using SpeedVac. The dried ADAs were suspended in denaturation solutions, such as 8 M urea. Subsequently, the isolated ADAs were subjected to enzymatic digestions, such as trypsin digestion, and LC-MS analysis for isotyping and quantification of ADAs.",
