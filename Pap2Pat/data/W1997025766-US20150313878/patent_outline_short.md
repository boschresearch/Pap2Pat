# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate prostate cancer diagnosis

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- outline invention methods

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- introduce soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) protein
- motivate cAMP-dependent signaling in cell proliferation and apoptosis
- describe role of sAC in prostate cancer cells
- provide method of inhibiting proliferation of prostate cancer cells using sAC inhibitor
- describe composition and administration of sAC inhibitor
- provide method for diagnosing prostate cancer by assaying sAC gene expression or protein production
- describe detection methods for sAC protein production
- describe sAC splice variants
- prepare antibody against sAC
- detect antibody binding to sAC
- identify overexpression of sAC gene or protein
- select treatment option for prostate cancer subject
- provide examples of the invention

### Example 1

- demonstrate sAC protein overproduction in prostate cancer cells

### Example 2

- demonstrate sAC protein overproduction in prostate cancer cells
- analyze sAC protein distribution in prostate cancer cells

### Example 3

- analyze sAC protein production in prostate cancer cell lines
- demonstrate inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation by suppressing sAC activity
- validate sAC knockdown methods for inhibiting prostate cancer cell proliferation

### Example 4

- demonstrate cell cycle arrest
- investigate sAC control of G2/M transition
- examine role of PKA and EPAC in proliferation control
