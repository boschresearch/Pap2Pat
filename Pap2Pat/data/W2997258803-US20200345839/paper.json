    "title": "Development of hypoallergenic variants of the major horse allergen Equ c 1 for immunotherapy by rational structure based engineering",
    "date": "2019-12-27",
    "abstract": "The use of recombinant allergens is a promising approach in allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT). Considerable limitation, however, has been the ability of recombinant allergens to activate effector cells leading to allergic reactions. Recombinant hypoallergens with preserved protein folding and capacity to induce protective IgG antibodies binding effectively to the native allergen upon sensitization would be beneficial for safer AIT. In this study, hypoallergen variants of the major horse allergen Equ c 1 were designed by introducing one point mutation on the putative IgE epitope region and two mutations on the monomer-monomer interface of Equ c 1 dimer. The recombinant Equ c 1 wild type and the variants were produced and purified to homogeneity, characterized by size-exclusion ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. The IgE-binding profiles were analyzed by a competitive immunoassay and the biological activity by a histamine release assay using sera from horse allergic individuals. Two Equ c 1 variants, Triple 2 (V47K + V110E + F112K) and Triple 3 (E21Y + V110E + F112K) showed lower allergen-specific IgE-binding capacity and decreased capability to release histamine from basophils in vitro when using sera from six allergic individuals. Triple 3 showed higher reduction than Triple 2 in IgE-binding (5.5 fold) and in histamine release (15.7 fold) compared to wild type Equ c 1. Mutations designed on the putative IgE epitope region and monomer-monomer interface of Equ c 1 resulted in decreased dimerization, a lower IgE-binding capacity and a reduced triggering of an allergic response in vitro .",

                "Currently, allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is based on allergen extracts obtained from natural sources. It has been argued over a decade that these extracts have shortages mainly because of their inconsistent characteristics and quality. Due to the inherent heterogeneous property of natural allergen sources and extract producing methods, the extracts contain individual allergens with variable content and concentration but also with undefined biological activity. In addition, extracts contain large variety of non-allergenic materials and contaminants which nature is usually unknown and which may have, for example, toxic or undesired immunomodulatory effects. Recombinant allergens produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP) and adequately characterized to show high purity and consistent quality offer several advantages over extracts as medicinal products, most importantly due to the accurate dose administration during AIT1.",
                "AIT causes various immunological changes especially in T cells leading to an early increase in allergen-specific IgE response, which decline later and an increase in the allergen-specific protective IgG response, especially subtype IgG4. Protective IgG antibodies capture invading allergen molecules before they reach the effector-cell bound IgE antibodies thus preventing activation of mast cells or basophils2.",
                "A number of clinical trials with recombinant allergens, their variants or allergen-derived peptides with or without carrier proteins have been conducted1. Peptides or their derivatives have been favored due to their minimal ability to activate effector cells that offers substantial safety factor. However, peptides are prone to rapid degradation by tissue and serum proteases and the use of peptide antigens in immunization experiments is consistently less effective compared to full length proteins3. The use of peptides in immunization generates antibodies which usually recognize denatured (unfolded) proteins whereas immunization with correctly folded proteins produce antibodies which bind to natively folded biologically active proteins3. One approach is to use a peptide carrier strategy which has been reported to induce allergen-specific antibodies that recognize also the peptides in the context of the complete allergens4.",
                "IgE epitopes are conformational consisting usually several non-continuous stretches (segments) of the polypeptide chain forming a specific three-dimensional structure on the surface of the allergen. The most accurate method to determine an IgE epitope is to co-crystallize the allergen in a complex with the Fab-fragment of patient-derived IgE-antibody5. Due to rather challenging techniques associated with isolation of allergen specific IgE antibodies and co-crystallization of protein complexes, only two such IgE/Fab-allergen complex structures have been determined so far; for bovine milk allergen Bos d 5 and for timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 2. Interestingly, in both of the studies the overall spatial shape of the IgE epitope was flat consisting mainly of secondary structure elements (\u03b2-strands) differing from IgG epitopes which are typically located in the protruding regions of allergens6,7.",
                "The immunocomplex structure of Bos d 5 revealed also that the allergen formed a dimer to which two identical Fab fragments were simultaneously bound indicating that two monoclonal IgE antibodies would be able to form a productive complex with a dimeric allergen to active mast cell or basophil6. In our subsequent studies involving a number of allergens with their crystal structures and mass spectrometric analyses, we have discovered that majority of the allergens are able to form weak or transient dimers depending on the allergen concentration8. We have proposed a sequential model for mast cell or basophil activation in which monomeric allergen binds first to the Fc\u03b5RI bound IgE on the cell surface and subsequent dimerization is strongly boosted due to dimensional reduction (delocalization) on the cell surface leading to a signal transduction9.",
                "The strategy to design hypoallergenic variants which have a diminished capability to form allergen-IgE complexes on the surface of an effector cell would thus include mutations on the flat IgE epitope and/or monomer-monomer interface. We have implemented these ideas in designing of two hypoallergenic variants of the major horse allergen Equ c 1. Horse allergy occurs in people who regularly work with horses, either professionally or for recreational purposes, and also in people indirectly exposed to horses. The prevalence of horse sensitization in occupational settings varies between 3.6 and 16.5% and people with a respiratory allergy have about 5% sensitization rate10. Horse allergy is induced by exposure to the horse allergens, such as Equ c 1, c2, c3, c4 and c 5. Of these Equ c 1, the major horse allergen, is a hair dander protein and the most important from a clinical perspective. Equ c 1 is responsible for about 80% of anti-horse IgE antibody response in patients who have been exposed to horse allergens11. Immonen et al. have also analyzed T-cell epitopes of Equ c 1 and found two major, partially overlapping epitopes covering the amino acid residues 140\u2013163 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S1)12.",
                "Equ c 1 belongs to the lipocalin protein family, which members typically transport small hydrophobic ligands13. The lipocalin family contains a number of animal dander allergens but also previously mentioned bovine milk allergen Bos d 5. Equ c 1 allergen consists of 187 amino acid residues and has one disulphide bridge. The crystal structure has revealed a dimeric structure with a large monomer-monomer interface (1025 \u00c52) suggesting that dimeric form is predominant14.",
                "In this study, hypoallergenic variants of Equ c 1 were designed by targeting mutations to the (I) putative IgE epitope region aiming to reduce the binding of IgE antibodies and to the (II) monomer-monomer interface aiming to reduce dimerization of Equ c 1 monomers bound to the IgE-Fc\u025bRI receptor complex yet aiming to preserve the three-dimensional fold highly resembling that of the wild type allergen. Two variants (Triple 2 and 3) of Equ c 1 having one IgE-epitope mutation and two mutations on the monomer-monomer interface allergen were designed. The recombinant Equ c 1 wild type (wt) and variants were produced in E. coli, purified to homogeneity and validated by size-exclusion ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-UHPLC) and ultra-high resolution (FTICR) mass spectrometry (MS). IgE-binding profiles of allergens were analyzed by a competitive immunoassay and biological activity by a histamine release assay (HRA)."

                        "Mutations were designed both on the monomer-monomer interface and the putative IgE epitope of Equ c 1. The three-dimensional coordinates of Equ c 1 wild type were downloaded from the protein data bank (code 1EW3). The crystal structure contained one molecule in an asymmetric unit. The other half of the Equ c 1 dimer was formed by using the crystallographic symmetry operator. The extensive monomer-monomer interface (area 1024 \u00c52) was studied by testing different mutations in the middle of the interface in silico. The effect of mutations were predicted by evaluating their ability to break molecular surface complementarity and hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds and charged interactions between protein molecules. Hydrophobic groups do not interact well with polar groups, especially with charged ones. Therefore, substitution of hydrophobic residues with charged residues or vice versa should have more substantial effect to diminish protein-protein interaction. It was concluded that V110E and F112K mutations would be the most effective to disrupt the dimer formation of Equ c 1. The IgE epitopes of Equ c 1 are undefined, hence the putative IgE epitope was deduced by searching flat areas on the molecular surface of either side of the two-fold axis of symmetry of the Equ c 1 dimer by using PyMOL. Similarly, it was predicted that mutations E21Y and V47K would be the most promising candidates to achieve the decreased binding of IgE antibodies to Equ c 1. Two variants were selected for further studies: Triple 2 (V47K\u2009+\u2009V110E\u2009+\u2009F112K) and Triple 3 (E21Y\u2009+\u2009V110E\u2009+\u2009F112K) (Fig.\u00a01A\u2013D). Triple 1 variant with mutations G20V (putative IgE-epitope) combined to V110E and F112K was also designed, expressed in E.coli and purified with similar protocols as Triple 2 and 3. Expression level of Triple 1 was good, but it was much more prone to precipitate during adjustment of pH and concentration steps compared to Triple 2 and 3 and thus was not characterized further.Figure 1Molecular structure of Equ c 1 dimer.

Similarly, the molecular masses of cytoplasmic Triple 2 (20,206.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009Da) and Triple 3 (20,211.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009Da) corresponded precisely with the theoretical masses calculated from the amino acid sequences of the hypoallergenic variants (20,206.02\u2009Da and 20,211.01\u2009Da for Triple 2 and Triple 3, respectively). The r Equ c 1 wt and Triple allergens were detected to be highly pure and homogeneous.Figure 2The high resolution mass spectra for rEqu c 1 wt in denatured (A) and native form (B), and for Triple 3 in denatured form (C) and in native form (D).

                        "Native mass spectrometry was used to study the oligomeric state of proteins and to investigate the correct folding of the hypoallergenic variants compared with rEqu c 1 wt. The native MS showed that at the protein concentration of 40\u2009\u03bcM, the rEqu c 1 wt allergen predominantly exists as a dimeric form, whereas the rEqu c 1 variants are mainly monomeric. The native ESI FT-ICR mass spectra displayed a limited number of low charge states, indicating that both the wild-type allergen and the variants have similar, tightly folded structures (Fig.\u00a02B,D).",

The fitted curve of the free monomeric allergen concentration against the total allergen concentration is shown in Fig.\u00a01F. The calculated dissociation constant Kd for rEqu c 1 wt dimer was 15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009nM which indicates strong tendency for Equ c 1 to dimerize but showing also a nature of this allergen to dissociate to monomers at nanomolar concentrations. It was not possible to perform similar measurements at different concentrations for Triple 2 and 3 because the signal for dimer was very low. However, by using intensities of monomer and dimer of Triple 3 at a single concentration (Fig.\u00a02D), it can be estimated that Kd for Triple 3 dimer would be roughly 0.8\u2009mM."

The wild-type Equ c 1 was used to capture anti-Equ c 1 IgE antibodies from a human serum sample as increasing amounts of soluble allergen (wt, Triple 2 or Triple 3) was used to inhibit the binding. Soluble allergen competed the binding of IgE antibodies to the immobilized wild type Equ c 1.

These values reflect strong binding of Equ c 1 to specific IgE antibodies of serum and is in agreement with previous studies which showed that IgE antibodies exhibit stronger binding to allergens (KD 10 to 100 pM) compared to IgG binding to antigens (KD 10 to 100\u2009nM)6. Both Triple 2 and Triple 3 variants showed consistently higher IC50 values compared to wild type, median values being 59 and 191 pM, respectively, except for the serum E which showed similar IC50 values between Triple 2 and wt. Reduced binding of allergen-specific IgEs to Triple variants 2 and 3 compared to wt allergen suggests that the mutations V47K (in Triple 2) and E21Y (in Triple 3) are located in the IgE epitope area of rEqu c 1 allergen. E21 seems to be more critical for IgE binding because its mutation produced consistently lower binding compared to V47 mutation. Both residues are located on the flat surface of the antiparallel \u03b2-sheet of Equ c 1 (Fig.\u00a01B,D). The differences in the results of the competitive immunoassay may reflect heterogenicity of IgE-response among allergic individuals.",
                        "This kind of flat or planar shape of an IgE epitope has previously been determined for Bos d 5 and Phl p 2 allergens from the immunocomplex structures between the Fab fragment of an IgE antibody and allergen6,7. Because mutations on this surface caused reduction in the IgE binding of sera from five different individuals, it could be argued that this deduced epitope located around V47 and E21 would be common or even generic for an IgE response among horse allergic individuals. Many recent studies have indicated that IgE response utilizes limited germline gene repertoire following somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation15\u201317. It is notable that different individuals seem to utilize similar type of sequences. This implicates that the number of IgE epitopes on the surface of an allergen is more limited compared to the number of IgG epitopes. Especially in the case of small allergens, as Equ c 1, dimer formation provides an optimal orientation of the IgE epitope(s) for recognition and binding by the IgE antibody-Fc\u03b5RI complex on the effector cell surface18. It has been earlier shown by Lascombe et al.14 that IgE binding of a serum pool of eight horse allergic individuals to Equ c 1 allergen was efficiently inhibited with only one anti-Equ c 1 monoclonal antibody mAb 220 indicating also that number of IgE epitopes of Equ c 1 is restricted."

Size-exclusion chromatography allows the separation of molecules in aqueous non-denaturing conditions based on their molecular size and shape, therefore enabling the separation of protein monomers from their dimers or aggregates without disrupting protein interactions. The native mass spectrometry and SE-UHPLC analyses indicate that rEqu c 1 wt exists predominantly in dimeric form in micromolar and higher concentrations but is able to dissociate to monomers at lower concentrations. These results are in agreement with the results of Gregoire et al.19 who used ultracentrifugation and gel-filtration chromatography and found the strong tendency for Equ c 1 to form dimer but also reported the dimers can be dissociated to monomers by decreasing the protein concentration or lowering the pH of the buffer solution. The strategy to introduce two alterations on the hydrophobic monomer-monomer interface by replacing two hydrophobic amino acid residues by charged amino acid residues proved to be successful since the dimer/monomer ratio of Equ c 1 was dramatically decreased in Triple 2 and Triple 3 as shown by SE-UHPLC and native mass spectrometric analyses. The very narrow charge state distribution in the native mass spectra shows that Triple 2 and Triple 3 are still very compactly folded. The used monomer mutations would thus be effective in the reduction of cross-linking of specific IgE-allergen complexes on the surface of basophils or mast cells."

On the other hand, the increase in IC50 values was smaller for Triple 2 (1.7 fold increase) and Triple 3 (5.5 fold increase) compared to EC50 values for Triple 2 (7.7 fold increase) and Triple 3 (15.7 fold increase). Because IC50 values reflects the binding of IgE antibodies, the higher increase in EC50 values can be explained by two mutations (V110E\u2009+\u2009F112K) on the monomer-monomer interface of Equ c 1.

                        "As reviewed recently by Valenta et al.1, recombinant allergen molecules have several advantages over natural extracts in AIT. In addition, it has been demonstrated that full length folded proteins are more effective in developing antibodies that recognize native structures3. It can be thus argued that natively folded recombinant allergen molecules or their derivatives with preserved native structure would be promising candidates in AIT. Phase II studies have been reached with recombinant wild type allergens from birch (Bet v 1) and timothy (Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, Phl p 6)1. The results have been positive but not so much superior that these products would have been further developed into market.",
                        "The key issues in the development of novel recombinant allergens or their derivatives for AIT are their efficacy and safety. One pathway forward to create a safe and efficient hypoallergen is to mutate a limited number of amino acids in allergen affecting its allergenicity yet preserving the genuine folded three-dimensional structure. Thus, the release of allergy mediators from mast cells and basophils and the consecutive appearance of allergic symptoms would be reduced. Instead, protective IgG antibodies against the wild type allergen would be induced. This would prevent mast cell and basophil activation and lead to the modulation of immunoresponse. However, this requires information on critical amino acid (hot spot) residues which especially contribute to the productive formation of allergen-IgE complex on the surface of mast cell or basophil.",
                        "Equ c 1 Triple 3 variant that contains three point mutations, one on the putative IgE epitope and two on the monomer-monomer interface, of the major horse allergen Equ c 1 has resulted in reduction of histamine release when using sera from five horse allergic patients. The mutations are not located in the region which was previously reported to include two major T-cell epitopes12. Amino acid sequence identity between Equ c 1 Triple 3 and wild type is extremely high, 98.4%, which considerably increases the possibility that IgG antibodies induced by Triple 3 would efficiently bind to Equ c 1 wt. Additionally as shown here, the Triple 3 was recombinantly produced and purified resulting in high purity, homogeneity and correct fold to support the steps toward consistent batch-to-batch manufacturing and safety of Triple 3 as medicinal product. Altogether this would make Triple 3 variant promising candidate for AIT in horse allergy. To evaluate the suitability of Triple 3 further for clinical studies, it would be important to test IgE-binding and histamine release with a wider panel of serum samples of individuals allergic to Equ c 1, to perform T-cell reactivity tests, and continue to animal studies."
