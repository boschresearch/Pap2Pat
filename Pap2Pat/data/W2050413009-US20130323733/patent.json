                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) is a non-suppurative inflammatory disorder of the canine central nervous system. Overrepresented in Pug dogs, NME also occurs in other small breeds including the Maltese and Chihuahua. The etiology of NME is unknown but non-Mendelian inheritance has been demonstrated in Pug dogs, suggesting a role for genetic risk factors in the development of disease.",
                        "As an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), NME primarily affects young to middle aged toy breed dogs. NME shares clinical similarities with atypical variants of multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans. Inflammation in NME is characterized by mixed mononuclear cell infiltrates within the cerebral hemispheres and cortical leptomeninges with common clinical signs including seizures, depression, behavior change, circling and visual deficits. Similar to severe non-prototypical forms of MS, such as the Marburg variant, NME is overrepresented in females, is rapidly progressive, and often carries a grave prognosis despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment.",
                        "NME initially was identified in Pug dogs in the late 1960s and is known to have a strong familial association in this breed. Purebred dog populations provide a unique opportunity for mapping genetic traits and recent technological developments have made it possible to leverage dogs as a model for the study of human genetic disease. Dogs and humans share similar physiology with over half of the known canine diseases having a similar phenotype to analogous human diseases. An evaluation of canine NME, a disorder having clinical similarities to atypical, fulminant variants of MS in human, is needed for identifying at risk and affected dogs, allowing development of targeted therapy and identifying similar genetic factors that are associated with the development of rapidly progressive MS in people.",
                        "Whether it is a human population or a canine population, the standard for measuring genetic variation among individuals in a population is the haplotype, which is an ordered combination of specific polymorphisms in the genome in a population. Because haplotypes represent the genetic variation across multiple loci, they provide a more accurate and reliable measurement of genetic variation than individual polymorphisms. In many cases, where an individual polymorphism may be found in a variety of genomic backgrounds, i.e., different haplotypes, no definitive coupling was shown between the polymorphism and the causative site for the phenotype (Clark A G, et al. (1998) Am J Hum Genet 63:595-612; Drysdale, et al. (2000) PNAS 97:10483-10488). Thus, there is an unmet need for information on what NME-associated haplotypes exist in the dog population. Since canine NME is a disorder having clinical similarities to MS in humans, canine NME haplotype information would be useful in improving the efficiency and output of NME and MS diagnosis, prognosis, and several steps in the drug discovery and development process, including target validation, identifying lead compounds, and early phase clinical trials of drugs for MS."

                        "The disclosure provides a method of assigning a subject to a necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) risk group in order to assess the likelihood of the subject being afflicted with the disease. This method can be employed to assess the risk at early stages of disease progression. The method includes providing a biological sample from the subject, detecting a marker in a biological sample, which can be a haplotype associated with NME and assigning the subject to the NME risk group based upon the presence or absence of the haplotype. The method involves directly or indirectly detecting the presence or absence of the marker. Multiple markers disclosed herein may be used in combination to improve the accuracy.",
                        "A haplotype refers to a segment of genomic DNA that is characterized by a specific combination of genetic markers (or alleles) arranged along the segment. A marker refers to a sequence characteristic of a particular allele. Detection of the disease also includes detection of the haplotype by SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) or other types of markers for the haplotype, but also indirectly through markers outside the haplotype by leveraging linkage disequilibrium to identify carriers of the haplotype. Examining haplotypes rather than individual SNPs gives much stronger signal in detecting disease association. In addition, haplotypes can represent a combined effect of several sites along the same chromosome that cannot be detected when these sites are tested one by one. In the present invention, in addition to determining a patient's relative risk for NME by haplotype, haplotype blocks, or tag SNPs, the diagnosis may include prescribing therapeutic regimens to treat, prevent or delay onset of NME.",
                        "A haplotype may be any combination of one or more closely linked alleles inherited as a unit with little genetic shuffling across generations. An allele includes any form of a particular nucleic acid that may be recognized as a form of the particular nucleic acid on account of its location, sequence, or any other characteristic that may identify it as being a form of the particular gene. Alleles include but need not be limited to forms of a gene (or, broadly, a nucleic acid sequence) that include point mutations, silent mutations, deletions, frame-shift mutations, SNPs, inversions, translocations, heterochromatic insertions, and differentially methylated sequences relative to a reference gene (or, broadly, a wild type nucleic acid sequence), whether alone or in combination. An allele of a gene may or may not produce a functional protein; may produce a protein with altered function, localization, stability, dimerization, or protein-protein interaction; may have overexpression, underexpression or no expression; may have altered temporal or spatial expression specificity. The presence or absence of an allele may be detected through the use of any process known in the art, including using primers and probes designed accordingly for PCR, sequencing, hybridization analyses. An allele may also be called a mutation or a mutant, in view of its wild-type. An allele may be compared to another allele that may be termed a wild type form of an allele. In some cases, the wild type allele is more common than the mutant.",
                        "A haplotype may comprise a specific combination of polymorphisms. The polymorphism may be a single nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic sequences of different individuals are remarkably similar. However, when the chromosomes of two humans are compared, on average, there is about one in every 1000 to 1,200 bases of the DNA sequences that differs. As such, one individual might have an A at that location, while another individual has a G, or a person might have extra bases at a given location or a missing segment of DNA. Differences in individual bases are the most common type of genetic variation. These genetic differences are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs associated with a nearby gene may be used as markers to locate or map the gene. Some SNPs are associated with each other, and may be inherited in blocks.",
                        "The difference of a single genetic variance such as a SNP can delineate a distinct haplotype. A \u201cSNP haplotype block\u201d or \u201chaplotype block\u201d is a nucleic acid sequence containing a group of SNPs or polymorphisms that do not appear to recombine independently resulting in reduced genetic variability, but are passed together from generation to generation in variable-length blocks. The combination of polymorphisms, haplotype patterns and haplotype blocks may be referred to as a \u201chaplotype\u201d or \u201chaplotype structure\u201d in a nucleic acid sequence of interest. For example, a haplotype can be a set of SNPs, alleles, or genetic markers on a single chromatid that are genetically linked, and thus, are likely to be inherited as a unit. \u201cLinked\u201d, \u201clinkage\u201d, or \u201callelic association\u201d means the preferential association of a particular allele or genetic marker with a specific allele or genetic marker at a nearby chromosomal location more frequently than expected by chance for any particular allele frequency in the population. For example, if locus X has alleles a and b, which occur equally frequently, and linked locus Y has alleles c and d, which occur equally frequently, one would expect the combination ac to occur with a frequency of 0.25. If ac occurs more frequently, then alleles a and c are in linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium may result from natural selection of certain combination of alleles or because an allele has been introduced into a population too recently to have reached equilibrium with linked alleles. A marker in linkage disequilibrium can be particularly useful in detecting susceptibility to disease (or other phenotype) notwithstanding that the marker itself does not cause the disease. For example, a marker (X) that is not itself a causative element of a disease, but which is in linkage disequilibrium with a gene (including regulatory sequences) (Y) that is a causative element of a phenotype, can be detected to indicate susceptibility to the disease in circumstances in which the gene Y may not have been identified or may not be readily detectable.",
                        "Haplotypes are the particular combinations of alleles observed in a population, and are regions over which there is a very small proportion (often less than 5%) of informative SNP pairs showing strong evidence of historical recombination. Haplotype patterns may be disrupted by forces other than recombination, such as, recurrent mutation, gene conversion, or simply genome assembly or genotyping errors, which accounts for the approximate 5% disruption. Generally, directly genotyping pedigrees and using molecular methods, such as allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) and somatic cell hybrids, in combination with genotyping can unambiguously assign alleles to chromosomes and thus determine the haplotypes. Other methods of determining or constructing a haplotype include statistical inference using various algorithms to process genotype data. Further, two or more alleles likely to be inherited as a unit is termed a haplotype block. Typically, a haplotype block refers to a chromosome region of high linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, and are regions of low recombination flanked by recombination hotspots (e.g., Cardon, L R and Abecasis, G R, Trends in Genetics, 19(3):135-140 (2003)). When one or more haplotype blocks are associated with a phenotypic trait, the haplotype block serves as a genetic marker represented by a genetic locus comprising one or more linked genetic variations that would be inherited as a unit, more frequently than not, in an individual having the associated phenotypic trait. In each block, a small fraction of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), referred to as \u201ctag SNPs,\u201d (also called \u201ctagging SNPs\u201d) can be used to distinguish a large fraction of the haplotypes. The main advantage of using haplotype blocks for phenotype association is that only a few tag SNPs need to be genotyped to represent haplotypes within a block.",
                        "Tag SNPs are those markers capturing the haplotype diversity to best represent the genetic variation of a haplotype. As such, genotyping a tag SNP would eliminate the need to genotype other markers in strong linkage disequilibrium with the tag SNP. Tag SNPs may be determined using various algorithms. Different algorithms may result in different sets of tag SNPs because of their various efficiency which is affected by the specificity, size of the population used for generating genotyping data, and the variability in haplotype diversity across the target genomic regions. Therefore, a chosen subset of SNPs may or may not represent the haplotype architecture observed when variation from the entire sequence is considered. In that situation, more SNPs may be ultimately required to be used as a combination of tag SNPs necessary for genotyping for haplotype determination. Therefore, tag SNPs, the haplotype block, or the haplotype, may be used to identify individuals from biological samples for traits of interest. The haplotype block may, in turn, be used to identify individual polymorphic sites, or candidate disease-associated genes for developing therapeutics and diagnostics. In the present invention, a DLA class II region comprising SEQ ID NO. 1 is identified as having significant association to the risk of NME. The haplotype comprising SEQ ID NO. 1 may be further described using 35 tag SNPs, or 19 haplotype blocks, some of which can be detected by one or more tag SNPs as disclosed. As disclosed in the present invention, the haplotype, the tag SNPs and the haplotype blocks are markers or marker combinations that can be used for NME identification and treatment. The present invention also discloses a STYX region containing a haplotype associated to the risk of NME.",
                        "Other additional markers that may also be used are those genetically linked to the markers disclosed herein. These additional markers, such as, SNPs or other polymorphic markers, are in close enough proximity to have a statistically significant association with the marker disclosed herein. Such statistically significant association may be defined by linkage disequilibrium, and the subject may be placed into a group either at higher or lower risk for NME depending on the presence of the additional marker, or a close isoform thereof, that is closely linked to higher or lower risk indicating markers.",
                        "Examples of methods for detecting the haplotype blocks are described herein and other suitable methods are well known to those of skill in the art. Suitable methods for detecting haplotypes in a sample include sequence analysis, hybridization analysis using a nucleic acid probe such DNA or RNA (e.g., Northern analysis, Southern analysis, dot blot analysis), and restriction digestion, genotyping the tag SNP(s) of the haplotype in each haplotype block.",
                        "In the methods of the invention, a sample can be obtained from the individual and used in the methods to detect the presence of the haplotype blocks. The haplotype block can be detected in any sample obtained from the individual that comprises the individual's DNA. For example, a haplotype block can be detected in a tissue sample (e.g., skin, muscle, organ, placenta), a cell sample (e.g., fetal cells), a fluid sample (e.g., blood, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, lymph) and any combination thereof. Methods of obtaining such samples or extracting nucleic acid from such samples are known to those of skill in the art.",
                        "The detection of the haplotype block in the individual can be compared to a control. Suitable controls for use in the methods provided herein are apparent to those of skill in the art. For example, a suitable control can be established by assaying one or more subjects which do not have NME. Alternatively, a control can be obtained using a statistical model to obtain a control value (standard value; known standard). See, for example, models described in Knapp, R. G. and Miller M. C. (1992) Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, William and Wilkins, Harual Publishing Co. Malvern, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "Various parameters may be used to assess how accurately the presence or absence of a marker signifies a particular physiological or cellular characteristic. Such parameters include a positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, odds ratio, and/or hazard ratio. In the case of a likelihood ratio, the likelihood that the presence or absence of the marker would be found in a sample with a particular cellular or physiological characteristic is compared with the likelihood that the presence or absence of the marker would be found in a sample lacking the particular cellular or physiological characteristic.",
                        "An odds ratio measures effect size and describes the amount of association or non-independence between two groups. An odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of a marker being present or absent in one set of samples versus the odds of the marker being present or absent in the other set of samples. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the event or condition is equally likely to occur in both groups. An odds ratio greater or less than 1 indicates that presence or absence of the marker is more likely to occur in one group or the other depending on how the odds ratio calculation was set up.",
                        "A hazard ratio may be calculated by estimate of relative risk. Relative risk is the chance that a particular event will take place. It is a ratio of the probability that an event such as development or progression of a disease will occur in samples in which a particular marker is present over the probability that the event will occur in samples in which the particular marker is absent. Alternatively, a hazard ratio may be calculated by the limit of the number of events per unit time divided by the number at risk as the time interval decreases. In the case of a hazard ratio, a value of 1 indicates that the relative risk is equal in both the first and second groups; a value greater or less than 1 indicates that the risk is greater in one group or another, depending on the inputs into the calculation.",
                        "When a SNP haplotype block is identified by a SEQ ID NO, the presence of SNPs detected in a given haplotype block disclosed herein in a dog is associated with a greater risk that the dog will develop NME, if it has not yet shown symptoms of NME; whereas the absence of SNPs detected in a given haplotype block disclosed herein in a dog is associated with a lesser risk that the dog will develop NME. A nucleic acid may be termed to be specific to a haplotype block or specific to a SNP within a haplotype block. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid specific to a haplotype block or a SNP within a haplotype block contains sequence that is complementary to one of the double stranded nucleic acid sequence of at least one SNP that is within the haplotype block. Yet, in another embodiment, a nucleic acid specific to a haplotype block may be complementary to a SNP outside of the haplotype block but is associated with haplotype block. Still, in another embodiment, a nucleic acid specific to a haplotype block may be complementary to any SNPs associated with the haplotype whether the SNP is part of the haplotype block or not.",
                        "In addition to markers such as, a haplotype block, or SNPs within the haplotype block, or nucleic acids specific to the haplotype block or SNPs thereof, which are identified to be associated with a particular phenotype, a marker may be any molecular structure produced by a cell, expressed inside the cell, accessible on the cell surface, or secreted by the cell. A marker may be any protein, carbohydrate, fat, nucleic acid, catalytic site, or any combination of these such as an enzyme, glycoprotein, cell membrane, virus, cell, organ, organelle, or any uni- or multi-molecular structure or any other such structure now known or yet to be disclosed whether alone or in combination. A marker may also be called a target and the terms are used interchangeably.",
                        "A marker may be represented by the sequence of a nucleic acid from which it can be derived or any other chemical structure. Examples of such nucleic acids include miRNA, tRNA, siRNA, mRNA, cDNA, or genomic DNA sequences including complimentary sequences. Alternatively, a marker may be represented by a protein sequence. The concept of a marker is not limited to the products of the exact nucleic acid sequence or protein sequence by which it may be represented. Rather, a marker encompasses all molecules that may be detected by a method of assessing the presence of the marker, whether through direct or indirect approaches.",
                        "Examples of molecules encompassed by a marker represented by a particular sequence or structure or allele include point mutations, silent mutations, deletions, frame-shift mutations, translocations, alternative splicing derivatives, differentially methylated sequences, differentially modified protein sequences, truncations, soluble forms of cell membrane associated markers, and any other variation that results in a product that may be identified as the marker. The following non-limiting examples are included for the purposes of clarifying this concept: If expression of a specific marker in a sample is assessed by RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction), and if the sample expresses an mRNA sequence different from the sequence used to identify the specific marker by one or more nucleotides, but the marker may still be detected using RT-PCR, then the specific marker encompasses the mRNA sequence present in the sample. Alternatively, if expression of a specific marker in a sample is assessed by an antibody and the amino acid sequence of the marker in the sample differs from a sequence used to identify marker by one or more amino acids, but the antibody is still able to bind to the version of the marker in the sample, then the specific marker encompasses the amino acid sequence present in the sample.",
                        "In the present invention, the marker represented by a group of linked SNPs, \u201chaplotype block,\u201d \u201chaplotype\u201d, or gene products, including mRNA and protein, produced from the genes within the haplotype may be detected by a variety of methodologies or procedures that are well known in the art including, but not limited to, nucleic acid hybridization, antibody binding, activity assay, PCR, SI nuclease assay and via gene chip or microarray, as well as any other assay known in the art that may be used for such detection.",
                        "Detecting the presence or absence of a marker disclosed herein or a close isoform thereof may be carried out either directly or indirectly by any suitable methodology. A variety of techniques are known to those skilled in the art. Those techniques, generally, involve receiving a biological sample containing DNA or protein from the subject, and then detecting whether or not the marker or a close isoform thereof is present in the sample, and then determining the presence or absence of the marker in the sample.",
                        "The marker may be detected by direct methods by determining the presence of an allele including, but not limited to, any form of DNA sequencing such as, Sanger sequencing, next generation sequencing, pyrosequencing, sequencing by ligation, sequencing by synthesis, single molecule sequencing, pooled and barcoded DNA sequencing or any other sequencing method now known or yet to be disclosed; PCR-based methods such as, real-time PCR, quantitative PCR, reverse transcription PCR or any combination of these; allele specific ligation; comparative genomic hybridization; or any other method that allows the detection of a particular nucleic acid sequence within a sample or enables the differentiation of one nucleic acid from another nucleic acid that differs from the first nucleic acid by one or more nucleotides.",

Solid-supports suitable for use in detection methods of the disclosure include substrates made of silicon, glass, plastic, paper and the like, which may be formed, for example, into wells (as in 96-well plates), slides, sheets, membranes, fibers, chips, dishes, and beads. The solid support may be treated, coated or derivatized to facilitate the immobilization of the SNP-specific oligonucleotide or target nucleic acid. Detecting the nucleotide or nucleotide pair of interest may also be determined using a mismatch detection technique, including but not limited to the RNase protection method using riboprobes (Winter et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:7575; Meyers et al. (1985) Science 230:1242) and proteins which recognize nucleotide mismatches, such as the E. coli mutS protein (Modrich (1991) Ann. Rev. Genet. 25:229-53). Alternatively, variant SNPs or variant alleles can be identified by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (Orita et at. (1989) Genomics 5:874-9); Humphries et al. (1996) in MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC DISEASES, Elles, ed., pp. 321-340) or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Wartell et al. (1990) Nucl. Acids Res. 18:2699706); Sheffield et al.

Such determination includes categorizing a cell as a particular normal or diseased cell type, as having a likelihood of having or not having one or more diseases, a likelihood that a present disease will progress, remain unchanged, or regress, a likelihood that a disease will respond or not respond to a particular therapy, or any other disease outcome such as, the likelihood that a cell will move, senesce, apoptose, differentiate, metastasize, or change from any state to any other state or maintain its current state.",
                        "One type of cellular or physiological characteristic is the risk that a particular disease outcome will occur. Assessing this risk includes the performing of any type of test, assay, examination, result, readout, or interpretation that correlates with an increased or decreased probability that an individual has had, currently has, or will develop a particular disease, disorder, symptom, syndrome, or any condition related to health or bodily state. Examples of disease outcomes include, but need not be limited to survival, death, progression of existing disease, remission of existing disease, initiation of onset of a disease in an otherwise disease-free subject, or the continued lack of disease in a subject in which there has been a remission of disease. Assessing the risk of a particular disease encompasses diagnosis in which the type of disease afflicting a subject is determined. Assessing the risk of a disease outcome also encompasses the concept of prognosis. A prognosis may be any assessment of the risk of disease outcome in an individual in which a particular disease has been diagnosed. Assessing the risk further encompasses prediction of therapeutic response in which a treatment regimen is chosen based on the assessment. Assessing the risk also encompasses a prediction of overall survival after diagnosis.",
                        "The skilled artisan understands how to utilize a selected marker or a plurality of selected markers that signifies a particular physiological or cellular characteristic. In diagnosing the presence of a disease, a threshold value may be obtained by performing the assay method on samples obtained from a population of patients having a certain type of disease (e.g., NME) and from a second population of subjects that do not have the disease. In assessing disease outcome or the effect of treatment, a population of patients, all of which may develop a disease such as NME, may be followed for a period of time. After the period of time expires, the population may be divided into two or more groups. For example, the population may be divided into a first group of patients who did develop NME and a second group of patients who did not develop NME. Examples of endpoints include occurrence of one or more symptoms of disease, death or other states to which the given disease may progress. If presence of the marker in a sample population statistically significantly aligns with one group relative to the other group, the subject from which the sample was derived may be assigned a risk of having the same outcome as the patient group that differentially displays the marker.",

Nucleic acids may include but need not be limited to RNA, cDNA, tRNA, mitochondrial DNA, plasmid DNA, siRNA, genomic DNA, or any other naturally occurring or artificial nucleic acid molecule. The sample may be any type of sample derived from the subject, including any fluid or tissue that may contain one or more markers associated with the haplotype.

                                "Haplotype analysis using Haploview (Barrett et al. 2005) identified 19 haplotype blocks across a 4.1 Mb region of DLA II on chromosome 12, all of which were associated with an increased risk for developing NME with P values ranging from 2.1\u00d710\u22123 to 1.13\u00d710\u22128 (FIG. 4 and Table 3). This 4.1 Mb region located from positions 4,713,392 to 8,834,652 of the genomic DNA sequence on Chromosome 12 (SEQ ID NO:1, available in the canFam2 Canine genomic sequence database) was shown in FIG. 4 with 19 haplotype blocks generated in Haploview (Gabriel et al. 2002). Negative log P values from single SNP associations were derived from genome-wide analysis after removal of population outliers and individual SNPs were plotted as circles. The horizontal dotted line represents the threshold for significant association after Bonferroni correction of \u2212log(P)>6.24. Each haplotype is described by a group of individual tagging SNP genotypes (or alleles) that are associated with risk. The presence of some or all of these alleles will determine the risk status. For example, the tagging SNPs in Table 1 that fall in a haplotype block in Table 3 can determine the presence of that block. Based on the tagging SNPs genotype, the risk status of the haplotype block can be determined. When look at the entire 4.1 Mb region, the presence of one or more risk associated haplotype blocks can determine the risk of NME. Further, among these 23 haplotype blocks (Table 3 and Table 4), Block 4 is further described, i.e. the risk status of the haplotype block can be determined, by a combination of tagging SNPs for which the risk alleles are at position 5166878=A, 5217389=G, 5227499=G and 5275229=A. Similarly, Block 5 contains tagging SNPs for which position the risk alleles are at 5622709=C; Block 6 contains tagging SNPs for which the risk alleles are at position 5710832=A, 5734305=A, 5791672=G, 5829667=A, 5843592=G, 5916360=A, 5931001=G, 5935549=A, 5992526=A, 6024841=T, 6028685=G, 6059850=A, 6064245=C; Block 7 contains tagging SNPs for which the risk alleles are at position 6149213=G, 6160615=A, 6164202=A, 6184107=G, 6197313=A, 6200280=G, 6218850=A, 6238545=A, 6257019=G, 6289014=G, 6299459=A, 6311277=C, 6320910=A, and 6342204=A; Block 8 contains tagging SNPs for which the risk alleles are at position 6653816=A, 6686088=G, 6793393=A, 6809061=A and 6832252=A; and Block 19 contains tagging SNPs for which the risk allele is at position 8822596=C (see Table 1 and Table 3).",
                                "Manually forcing all of these haplotype blocks into a single haplotype resulted in the creation of a 4.1 Mb haplotype containing 241 SNPs (SEQ ID NO: 1). This haplotype was common and strongly associated with an increased risk of developing NME at a case frequency of 85.1%, control frequency at 38.4% with significance p value at 7.97\u00d710\u22127. The strong association of the NME disease with DLA II supports an autoimmune etiology. Haplotype analysis of the DLA II region identified a large, common block strongly associated with altered disease risk. Polygenic loci with MHC II polymorphisms show the strongest disease association, as observed between DLA II and NME association."

Genotyping of 30 NME-affected Pug dogs and 68 healthy, control Pugs identified two loci associated with NME, including a region within dog leukocyte antigen class II on chromosome 12 that remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Our results support the utility of this high density SNP array, confirm that dogs are a powerful model for mapping complex genetic disorders and provide important preliminary data to support in depth genetic analysis of NME in numerous affected breeds."
