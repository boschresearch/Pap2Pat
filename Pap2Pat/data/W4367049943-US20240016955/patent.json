                        "Deafness and blindness are two of the most common and most devastating neurological disorders. In many cases, deafness and blindness result from single gene defects (e.g., PCDH15 mutation that causes Usher syndrome type 1F). However, effective therapy for treating Usher syndrome type 1F remains elusive.",
                        "Mutations in PCDH15 cause Usher 1F, a recessive syndrome characterized by profound congenital deafness and absence of vestibular function, and progressive blindness beginning in the second decade of life. Because patients who lack hearing and balance rely on vision for communication and mobility, the late-onset blindness is particularly devastating.",

Gene addition therapy could be an attractive treatment for those with homozygous recessive mutations. However, the PCDH15 coding sequence of \u02dc5.8 kb is too large to fit into a single AAV capsid, which is limited to \u02dc4.7 kb of transgene. There are no known methods to reconstitute wild-type PCDH15 expression in inner ear or eye cells currently."

As used herein, the term \u201cisolated\u201d means artificially produced. As used herein with respect to nucleic acids, the term \u201cisolated\u201d means: (i) amplified in vitro by, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (ii) recombinantly produced by cloning; (iii) purified, as by cleavage and gel separation; or (iv) synthesized by, for example, chemical synthesis. An isolated nucleic acid is one which is readily manipulable by recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art. Thus, a nucleotide sequence contained in a vector in which 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 restriction sites are known or for which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sequences have been disclosed is considered isolated but a nucleic acid sequence existing in its native state in its natural host is not. An isolated nucleic acid may be substantially purified, but need not be. For example, a nucleic acid that is isolated within a cloning or expression vector is not pure in that it may comprise only a tiny percentage of the material in the cell in which it resides. Such a nucleic acid is isolated, however, as the term is used herein because it is readily manipulatable by standard techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art.",

The PCDH15 gene is a member of the cadherin superfamily. Family members encode integral membrane proteins that mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Full-length PCDH15 includes (from N-terminus to C-terminus): a signal peptide, eleven extracellular calcium-binding domains (EC domains, EC1-EC11), a membrane adjacent domain (MAD12), a transmembrane domain, and a unique cytoplasmic domain. PCDH15 is expressed in several isoforms differing in their cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that alternative splicing regulates PCDH15 function in hair cells. There are three prominent splice isoforms of PCDH15 according to its unique cytoplasmic domain: CD1, CD2, and CD3. PCDH15 plays an essential role in maintenance of normal retinal and cochlear function. It is thought to interact with cadherin related 23 (CDH23) to form tip-link filaments.",

In some embodiments, an isolated nucleic acid comprises two adeno-associated virus (AAV) inverted terminal repeats (ITR). The isolated nucleic acid (e.g., the recombinant AAV vector) may be packaged into a capsid protein and administered to a subject and/or delivered to a selected target cell. \u201cRecombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors\u201d are typically composed of, at a minimum, a transgene, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). The transgene may comprise, as disclosed elsewhere herein, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein (e.g., a first portion of PCDH15 or a second portion of PCDH15). In some aspects, the dual-AAV vector system forms a full-length PCDH15 coding sequence in the target cell by trans splicing. In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides a first dual-AAV vector system including two isolated nucleic acids (e.g., a first 5\u2032 isolated nucleic acid and a first 3\u2032 isolated nucleic acid) in a way that the two isolated nucleic acids form a full length PCDH15 mRNA in a target cell by trans-splicing. Trans-splicing, as used herein, refers to a form of RNA processing where exons from a primary RNA transcript transcribed from concatemerized DNA (e.g., concatemerized rAAV genomes) are spliced together and processed into a mature mRNA. This process is mediated by the spliceosome. In some embodiments, the first 5\u2032 isolated nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a splice donor 3\u2032 to the nucleotide sequence encoding the first portion of PCDH15. In addition, the first 3\u2032 isolated nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a splice acceptor 5\u2032 to the nucleotide sequence encoding the second portion of PCDH15. In eukaryotic cells, mRNA splicing occurs at intronic sites. A splice donor (e.g., 5\u2032 end of the intron) and a splice acceptor (e.g., 3\u2032 end of the intron) are required for splicing. Once the first 5\u2032 isolated nucleic acid and the first 3\u2032 isolated nucleic acid are delivered to a target cell (e.g., by rAAVs), the two isolated nucleic acids undergo head to tail concatemerization from 3\u2032 ITR of the first 5\u2032 isolated nucleic acid and 5\u2032 ITR of the first 3\u2032 isolated nucleic acid, such that the first 5\u2032 isolated nucleic acid and the first 3\u2032 isolated nucleic acid are combined into one single nucleic acid (e.g., a single DNA molecule), which can be transcribed into pre-mRNA. The pre-mRNA comprises the PCDH15 first portion mRNA, splice site comprising the splicing donor and splicing acceptor, and PCDH15 second portion mRNA. As part of the RNA splicing mechanism, the spliceosome of the cell can splice out the splice site and stitches the PCDH15 first portion mRNA and PCDH15 second portion mRNA together to form a complete mRNA encoding a full-length PCDH15.",

In some embodiments, the second 5\u2032 isolated nucleic acid further comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a splice donor and a first recombinogenic sequence 3\u2032 to the nucleotide sequence encoding the first portion of PCDH15. In addition, the second 3\u2032 isolated nucleic acid further comprises a second recombinogenic sequence, and a nucleotide sequence encoding a splice acceptor 5\u2032 to the nucleotide sequence encoding the second portion of PCDH15.

                                "In some aspects, the disclosure provides transfected host cells. The term \u201ctransfection\u201d is used to refer to the uptake of foreign DNA by a cell, and a cell has been \u201ctransfected\u201d when exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell membrane. A number of transfection techniques are generally known in the art. See, e.g., Graham et al. (1973) Virology, 52:456, Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning, a laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York, Davis et al. (1986) Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, Elsevier, and Chu et al. (1981) Gene 13:197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous nucleic acids, such as a nucleotide integration vector and other nucleic acid molecules, into suitable host cells.",
                                "A \u201chost cell\u201d refers to any cell that harbors, or is capable of harboring, a substance of interest. Often a host cell is a mammalian cell. A host cell may be used as a recipient of an AAV helper construct, an AAV plasmid, an accessory function vector, or other transfer DNA associated with the production of recombinant AAVs. The term includes the progeny of the original cell which has been transfected. Thus, a \u201chost cell\u201d as used herein may refer to a cell which has been transfected with an exogenous DNA sequence. It is understood that the progeny of a single parental cell may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total DNA complement as the original parent, due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201ccell line\u201d refers to a population of cells capable of continuous or prolonged growth and division in vitro. Often, cell lines are clonal populations derived from a single progenitor cell. It is further known in the art that spontaneous or induced changes can occur in karyotype during storage or transfer of such clonal populations. Therefore, cells derived from the cell line referred to may not be precisely identical to the ancestral cells or cultures, and the cell line referred to includes such variants.",
                                "As used herein, the terms \u201crecombinant cell\u201d refers to a cell into which an exogenous DNA segment, such as DNA segment that leads to the transcription of a biologically-active polypeptide or production of a biologically active nucleic acid, such as an RNA, has been introduced.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cvector\u201d includes any genetic element, such as a plasmid, phage, transposon, cosmid, chromosome, artificial chromosome, virus, virion, etc., which is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements, and which can transfer gene sequences between cells. Thus, the term includes cloning and expression vehicles, as well as viral vectors. In some embodiments, useful vectors are contemplated to be those vectors in which the nucleic acid segment to be transcribed is positioned under the transcriptional control of a promoter. A \u201cpromoter\u201d refers to a DNA sequence recognized by the synthetic machinery of the cell, or introduced synthetic machinery, required to initiate the specific transcription of a gene. The phrases \u201coperatively positioned,\u201d \u201cunder control\u201d or \u201cunder transcriptional control\u201d means that the promoter is in the correct location and orientation in relation to the nucleic acid to control RNA polymerase initiation and expression of the gene. The term \u201cexpression vector or construct\u201d means any type of genetic construct containing a nucleic acid in which part or all of the nucleic acid encoding sequence is capable of being transcribed.",

The rAAV, preferably suspended in a physiologically compatible carrier (e.g., in a composition), may be administered to a subject, e.g., host animal. In some embodiments, the host animal is a mammal. In some examples, the mammal is a human. In other embodiments, the mammal can be a non-human mammal, such as a human, mouse, rat, cat, dog, sheep, rabbit, horse, cow, goat, pig, guinea pig, hamster, chicken, turkey, or a non-human primate (e.g., cynomolgus monkey).",

In some embodiments, the injection is to the ear through round window membrane of the inner ear, into a semicircular canal of the inner ear, into the saccule or the utricle of the inner ear, or topical administration (e.g., ear drops). In some embodiments, the injection is injection into the eye (e.g., intravitreal or subretinal injection) or topical administration (e.g., eye drops). Combinations of administration methods (e.g., topical administration and injection through round window membrane of the inner ear) can also be used.",

Suitable carriers may be readily selected by one of skill in the art in view of the indication for which the rAAV is directed. \u201cAcceptable\u201d means that the carrier must be compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (and preferably, capable of stabilizing the active ingredient) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients (carriers) including buffers, which are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. (2000) Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Ed. K. E. Hoover. For example, one acceptable carrier includes saline, which may be formulated with a variety of buffering agents (e.g., phosphate buffered saline). Other exemplary carriers include sterile saline, lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, gelatin, dextran, agar, pectin, peanut oil, sesame oil, and water. The selection of the carrier is not a limitation of the present disclosure.",
                                "The rAAV containing pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may further comprise a suitable buffering agent. A buffering agent is a weak acid or base used to maintain the pH of a solution near a chosen value after the addition of another acid or base. In some examples, the buffering agent disclosed herein can be a buffering agent capable of maintaining physiological pH despite changes in carbon dioxide concentration (produced by cellular respiration). Exemplary buffering agents include, but are not limited to, HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) buffer, or Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS) buffer. Such buffers may comprise disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium chloride, or potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium chloride.",

Suitable exemplary preservatives include chlorobutanol, potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, propyl gallate, the parabens, ethyl vanillin, glycerin, phenol, and parachlorophenol. Suitable chemical stabilizers include gelatin and albumin.",
                                "The rAAV containing pharmaceutical composition described herein comprises one or more suitable surface-active agents, such as a surfactant. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. Suitable surfactants include, in particular, non-ionic agents, such as polyoxyethylenesorbitans (e.g., Tween\u2122 20, 40, 60, 80 or 85) and other sorbitans (e.g., Span\u2122 20, 40, 60, 80 or 85). Compositions with a surface-active agent will conveniently comprise between 0.05 and 5% surface-active agent, and can be between 0.1 and 2.5%. It will be appreciated that other ingredients may be added, for example, mannitol or other pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles, if necessary.",
                                "The rAAVs are administered in sufficient amounts to transfect the cells of a desired tissue (e.g., inner hair cells, outer hair cells, or photoreceptors of the eye) and to provide sufficient levels of gene transfer and expression without undue adverse effects. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, direct delivery to the selected organ (e.g., the ear and the eye), oral, inhalation (including intranasal and intratracheal delivery), intraocular, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intratumoral, and other parental routes of administration. Routes of administration may be combined, if desired.",

One of skill in the art can readily determine a rAAV virion dose range to treat a patient having a particular disease or disorder based on the aforementioned factors, as well as other factors.",
                                "An effective amount of a rAAV is an amount sufficient to infect an animal (e.g., mouse, rat, non-human primate or human), target a desired tissue (e.g., the inner ear or the eye). The effective amount will depend primarily on factors, such as the species, age, weight, health of the subject, and the tissue to be targeted, and may thus vary among animal and tissue. For example, an effective amount of the rAAV is generally in the range of from about 1 ml to about 100 ml of solution containing from about 109 to 1016 genome copies. In some cases, a dosage between about 1011 to 1013 rAAV genome copies are appropriate. In certain embodiments, about 109 rAAV genome copies are effective to target inner ear tissue (e.g., inner hair cells, outer hair cells, or photoreceptors of the eye). In some embodiments, a dose more concentrated than 109 rAAV genome copies is toxic when administered to the eye of a subject. Therefore, in certain embodiments, no more than about 109 rAAV genome copies are effective to target inner ear tissue (e.g., inner hair cells, outer hair cells, or photoreceptors of the eye). In some embodiments, an effective amount is produced using multiple doses of an rAAV composition.",
                                "In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than once per calendar day (e.g., a 24-hour period). In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than once per 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days. In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than once per calendar week (e.g., 7 days). In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than bi-weekly (e.g., once in a two-week period). In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than once per month (e.g., once in 30 days). In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than once per six months. In some embodiments, a dose of rAAV is administered to a subject no more than once per year (e.g., 365 days or 366 days in a leap year).",
                                "In some embodiments, rAAV compositions are formulated to reduce aggregation of AAV particles in the composition, particularly where high rAAV concentrations are present (e.g., \u02dc1013 GC/ml or more). Appropriate methods for reducing aggregation may be used, including, for example, the addition of surfactants, pH adjustment, salt concentration adjustment, etc. (See, e.g., Wright et al., Molecular Therapy (2005) 12, 171-178, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.)",
                                "Formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carrier solutions is well-known to those of skill in the art, as is the development of suitable dosing and treatment regimens for using the particular compositions described herein in a variety of treatment regimens. Typically, these formulations may contain at least about 0.1% of the active ingredient (e.g., the rAAV or the isolated nucleic acids described herein) or more, although the percentage of the active ingredient(s) may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 1 or 2% and about 70% or 80% or more of the weight or volume of the total formulation. Naturally, the amount of active ingredient (e.g., the rAAV or the isolated nucleic acids described herein) in each therapeutically useful composition may be prepared is such a way that a suitable dosage will be obtained in any given unit dose of the compound. Factors such as solubility, bioavailability, biological half-life, route of administration, product shelf life, as well as other pharmacological considerations will be contemplated by one skilled in the art of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations, and as such, a variety of dosages and treatment regimens may be desirable.",

In other embodiments, the target tissue is an eye. The rAAVs in suitably formulated pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein are delivered directly to the eye (e.g., photoreceptors). However, in certain circumstances it may be desirable to separately or in addition deliver the rAAV-based therapeutic constructs via another route, e.g., subcutaneously, intranasally, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In some embodiments, the administration modalities as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,543,158; 5,641,515, and 5,399,363 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) may be used to deliver rAAVs.",

Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. In many cases the form is sterile and fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.",

These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous administration, intramuscular administration, subcutaneous administration, intraperitoneal administration, subretinal administration, intravitreal administration, and injection through round window membrane of the inner ear. In this connection, a suitable sterile aqueous medium may be employed. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the host. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual host.",

Generally, a mutation or mutations in PCDH15 account for Usher syndrome type 1F. In some embodiments, the PCDH15 mutation can be, but are not limited to, point mutations, missense mutations, nonsense mutations, insertions, or deletions. In some examples, the PCDH15 gene mutations associated with Usher syndrome, type 1F include, but are not limited to, mutations in Table 1 (ClinVar, NCBI). In some embodiments, the mutation in PCDH15 is c.733C>T. Mutations in a PCDH15 gene of a subject (e.g., a subject having or suspected of having Usher Syndrome type 1F associated with a deletion or mutation of PCDH15 gene) may be identified from a sample obtained from the subject (e.g., a DNA sample, RNA sample, blood sample, or other biological sample) by any method known in the art. For example, in some embodiments, a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RNA, or a combination thereof) is extracted from a biological sample obtained from a subject, and nucleic acid sequencing is performed in order to identify a mutation in the PCDH15 gene. Examples of nucleic acids sequencing techniques include, but are not limited to, Maxam-Gilbert sequencing, pyrosequencing, chain-termination sequencing, massively parallel signature sequencing, single-molecule sequencing, nanopore sequencing, Illumina sequencing, etc. In some embodiments, a mutation in PCDH15 gene is detected indirectly, for example, by quantifying full-length PCDH15 protein expression (e.g., by Western blot) or function (e.g., by analyzing structure, function, etc.), or by direct sequencing of the DNA and comparing the sequence obtained to a control DNA sequence (e.g., a wild-type PCDH15 DNA sequence).",

                                "An effective amount may also depend on the mode of administration. For example, targeting a cochlear (e.g., inner hair cells, and outer hair cells) tissue by injection through the round window membrane of the inner ear may require different (e.g., higher or lower) doses, in some cases, than targeting a cochlear (e.g., inner hair cells, outer hair cells) tissue by another method (e.g., systemic administration, topical administration). In other cases, targeting the eye (e.g., photoreceptors) by injection behind the eye (e.g., subretinal injection and intravitreal injection) may require different doses, in some cases, than targeting the eye (e.g., photoreceptors) by another method (e.g., systemic administration, topical administration). Thus, in some embodiments, the injection is injection through the round window membrane of the inner ear. In some embodiments, the administration is via injection, optionally subretinal injection or intravitreal injection. In some embodiments, the administration is topical administration (e.g., topical administration to an ear). In some embodiments, the administration is posterior semicircular canal injection. In some cases, multiple doses of a rAAV are administered.",

Accordingly, methods and compositions for treating hereditary hearing loss and/or vision loss are also provided herein.",

                                "Hearing loss, congenital, or acquired, affects \u02dc30 million people in the United States alone (Lin et al., 2011). Congenital hearing loss occurs in about 1/1,000 births (Mason et al., 1998); about half have a defined genetic cause. So far, >150 genes and more than 8000 mutations have been causally linked to hearing loss. For congenital recessive deafness, gene addition is possible, while congenital dominant forms might be treated either by silencing or by correcting the mutated allele. Because the cochlea is surgically accessible and relatively immune-protected, gene therapy using viral vectors is an attractive approach to treatment. Gene therapy also holds promise for genetically complex forms of deafness such as age-related hearing loss, by enhancing survival of hair cells or spiral ganglion neurons (Wise et al., 2011) or by inducing trans-differentiation of supporting cells into hair cells (Li et al., 2015).",
                                "Significant advances have been made in gene therapy for deafness, primarily with gene addition therapy for small genes whose coding sequence will fit in an AAV (Kohrman & Raphael, 2013; Sacheli et al., 2013; Lustig & Akil, 2018). However, many deafness genes encode large proteins with coding sequences that do not fit, and more creative approaches must be developed to express therapeutic proteins within the target cells. Also, although conventional rAAV are safe and are currently used in clinical trials, none has led to efficient expression in all hair cells. In previous studies, AAVs transduced inner hair cells (IHCs) efficiently (Akil et al., 2012; Askew et al., 2015; Al-Moyed et al., 2019), leading to striking success in animal models for genes used only by inner hair cells (e.g., Vglut3, Otof). But few outer hair cells (OHCs) are transduced by conventional rAAV, so they are not sufficient for most deafness genes. Recently, new variants of AAV (exoAAV1, Anc80, AAV9-PHP.B) have been developed that are far more efficient in transducing OHCs, and these have been used for gene addition to both IHCs and OHCs (Pan et al., 2017; Gy\u00f6rgy et al., 2017; Gy\u00f6rgy et al., 2018). Significant but incomplete rescue of hearing has been demonstrated in mice lacking functional LHFPL5, TMC1 or CLRN1, because the best capsid, such as AAV9-PHP.B, still do not transduce 100% of OHCs. Thus, two major challenges remain: AAV capsids capable of efficient transduction of inner ear cells (e.g., inner hair cell and/or outer hair cell) of many species are needed, and strategies for delivering of deafness genes that are too large to be packaged into single AAV genomes are needed.",
                                "Diseases of the eye have been an attractive target for gene therapy as well. Many involve progressive retinal degeneration, so that a decades-long window for treatment exists in the early stages. The eye is a closed compartment, so that a much smaller amount of viral vector is needed; it is thought to be immune-privileged, so that AAV will elicit a muted immune response; and the retina is easily viewed, so that progression or reversal of the disease is easily monitored. The remaining problems for gene therapy in the retina include, but not limited to, the delivery of a large gene which exceeds the packaging capacity of AAVs into the eyes.",
                                "Usher Syndrome type 1 (USH1) is a recessively inherited syndrome characterized by profound congenital deafness and absence of vestibular function, and progressive blindness beginning in the second decade. Because patients who lack hearing and balance rely on vision for communication and mobility, the late-onset blindness is particularly devastating. Mutations in the PCDH15 gene, which encodes the protocadherin-15 protein (PCDH15) cause Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F). In the ClinVar database, there are 80 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, however, a single, founder mutation (c.733C>T; p.R245X) accounts for 64% of cases (Ben-Yosef et al., 2003). In the United States about 40 children are born each year with Usher 1F and there are 2500-3500 patients total. There are perhaps 10,000-15,000 USH1F patients worldwide. Gene therapy, to replace or repair the mutant gene, could prevent or repair the blindness and deafness. There are mild mutations (e.g. R134G, G262D and V528D) that do not cause blindness or compromise balance (Ahmed et al., 2003; Doucette et al., 2009), and these are associated with later onset hearing loss that may be treatable. Progressive blindness can be targeted by Usher 1F therapy in that it occurs over several decades. It is likely that there is a large window of opportunity for treatment and a potential patient pool of about 1,000 who retain some vision. Any therapies that preserve hearing in mouse models are likely to prevent blindness in human.",
                                "In hair cells of the inner ear, the PCDH15 protein forms the \u2018tip link\u2019 between adjacent stereocilia (Kazmierczak et al., 2007), pulling directly on ion channels to initiate the electrical response to sound (FIG. 1B). PCDH15 is a large protein of up to 1955 amino acids, forming 11 link-like \u2018extracellular cadherin\u2019 (EC) repeats and a transmembrane domain (FIG. 1A) (Ahmed et al., 2001; Ge et al., 2018). The X-ray crystal structure of the PCDH15 extracellular domain has been solved, so the structure of PCDH15 is known at the level of single atoms (Sotomayor et al., 2012; Araya-Secchi et al., 2016; Powers et al., 2017; Narui and Sotomayor, 2018; De-la-Torre et al., 2018).",
                                "Usher 1F patients have profound deafness at birth, so it may be that hair cells in newborn human Usher 1F cochleas have already degenerated beyond repair and that the therapeutic opportunity for deafness is limited. On the other hand, the blindness in Usher 1F does not appear until the second decade and is often not complete before the fourth decade. It is characterized first by the loss of rod photoreceptor cells (used in dim light) causing night blindness, and by subsequent loss of the cone photoreceptors, producing complete blindness. There is thus a long window for treatment-perhaps 20-30 years\u2014and a potential patient population of 1500-2500 in the U.S. Therefore, it is meaningful to test the best strategy in the eye because the therapeutic possibilities for reversing blindness are great.",
                                "In the retina, PCDH15 is found in the photoreceptor cells, both rods and cones (FIG. 1C). These cells have an inner segment, which contains the nucleus and synaptic machinery, and an outer segment, which has the light-sensing opsin proteins. Inner and outer segments are connected by a narrow, fragile, cilium-based stalk. In humans, the outer segment is stabilized by \u201ccalyceal processes\u201d that emanate from the inner segment and form a cup- or basket-like structure around the outer segment (FIG. 1C-1D). It is thought that PCDH15 ties the processes to each other or to the outer segment, and that mutations in PCDH15 destabilize the outer segment.",
                                "Accordingly, the present disclosure relates to the development of two AAV vectors that together encode full-length PCDH15 for treating deafness and blindness (e.g., Usher syndrome type 1F).",

                                "Both trans-splicing and hybrid methods are used to recombine and express a split PCDH15 coding sequence (FIG. 2A). First two AAV vectors are produced. Vector 1 includes a promoter, the N-terminal half of PCDH15, and a splice donor site. Vector 2 includes a splice acceptor, the C-terminal half of PCDH15, an HA tag, and a poly-A segment (FIG. 2B). Vector 2 can also include an IRES and eGFR coding sequence following the C-terminal half of PCDH15. A WPRE sequence can also to be added between coding sequences and poly A segment (FIG. 2C). Once in the same cell, concatemerization of the ITRs can lead to the internal ITR flanked by mRNA splice sites and splicing that creates a full-length PCDH15 coding sequence (FIG. 2B-2C). This method has worked well for dual-vector expression of otoferlin in inner hair cells of the cochlea (Al-Moyed et al., 2018). FIGS. 2D-2E are schematic illustration of vector maps of AAV vector 1 and vector 2 for delivering full-length PCDH15 to cells.",
                                "Alternatively, a hybrid method is also tested, in which the splice donor of vector 1 is followed by a highly recombinogenic sequence from F1 phage (HR), and the splice acceptor of vector 2 is preceded by the HR sequence. In the same cell, the F1 sequence recombines creating an artificial intron, which is spliced out to create full-length coding sequence (FIG. 2F). This has also been used for otoferlin, with an efficiency similar to trans-splicing.",
                                "The dual vectors were packaged in the AAV9-PHP.B capsid. HEK cells were first transduced with both N- and C-terminal vectors and proper recombination with RT-PCR across the splice junction is evaluated. Expression of full-length PCDH15 was detected with an antibody to an HA tag introduced at the C-terminus (FIG. 2H). Proper membrane targeting of PCDH15 in HEK cells using live-cell labeling with the antibody to the extracellular N-terminal domain was then evaluated.",
                                "Expression of PCDH15 and rescue of function in knockout mice was then tested. The dual AAVs were injected into the cochleae of P1 conditional knockout mice, and expression of full-length PCDH15 was evaluated at P5 or P30. At P5, expression and localization of full-length PCDH15 in hair cells was evaluated with antibody labeling, using both light and electron microscopy. Efficiency of recombination can be tested by comparing the number of PCDH15-labeled cells in these cochleas, to the number in cochleas transduced with a single vector expressing a short, HA-tagged protein (LHFPL5; Gy\u00f6rgy et al., 2017). Rescue of hair-cell development was then tested with SEM. Finally, hair-cell mechanotransduction with FM1-43 loading and physiology was then tested. If virus-injected ears have hair cells that label with FM1-43, single-cell electrophysiology was used to test whether dye-labeled cells have functional receptor currents. In adult animals (P30, P60), hearing of injected mice were tested by ABR. Vestibular function was also tested with assays for circling and swimming.",
                                "First, dual AAV vectors for PCDH15 and a HA tag (FIG. 2H) have been produced that encode full-length PCDH15 and have been injected into the inner ears of postnatal Pcdh15fl/fl\u00d7Gfi1-Cre mice. The recombination and splicing in cochlea cells were test. Test expression and localization of full-length PCDH15 in hair cells. Rescue of mechanotransduction at was tested at P5, and rescue of hearing and balance was tested at P30. Full length PCDH15 expression was detected in hair cells of neonatal mouse (FIG. 3A). These vectors also show substantial rescue of hearing, as assessed by ABR recording (FIG. 3B). Electron microscopy shows that dual-vector delivery of PCDH15 rescued hair bundle morphology in the conditional knockout mouse model, as shown in FIG. 3C. The control mouse has well-developed hair bundles, seen at low (left) and high (right) magnification (top panel of FIG. 3C). The mutant shows disorganized bundles, lacking many stereocilia (middle panel of FIG. 3C). In a mutant injected with dual vectors encoding PCDH15, many of the hair bundles are normal (bottom panel of FIG. 3C).",

The AAV9-PHP.B capsid is used initially, and other enhanced capsid proteins for primates are also tested. Again, the PCDH15 coding sequence includes a small epitope tag (either 3\u00d7HA or tandem GCN) in the extracellular MAD12 domain. The dual vectors are injected through the round window membrane in Macaca fascicularis monkeys (Gy\u00f6rgy et al., 2018). After one month, animals are sacrificed and expression of tagged PCDH15 assessed with an antibody to the tag. Robust expression in hair cells, and antibody label near the tips of the shorter stereocilia is expected. Toxicity with ABR for hearing and histology for inflammation and cell death is assessed.",

It was confirm that the conditional Pcdh15R245X/R245X knockout mice of Usher 1F have vision loss. A variety of AAV capsids are tested (e.g., AAV8, AAV9, AAV-BP2 and AAV9-PHP.B) for effective transduction of photoreceptors. AAV-PHP.B worked well. Further, effective promoters for driving gene expression in photoreceptors were previously identified, and ProA6 promoter showed good efficacy (J\u00fcttner et al, 2019). These mice produce no functional PCDH15 protein so they are a good model for this strategy.",
                                "Two weeks after dual-AAV vector injection into retina, expression and localization of the PCDH15 protein was evaluated. Confocal microscopy and electron microscopy are used to assay expression and localization by immunoreactivity in photoreceptors, with antibodies to the tag or to PCDH15. Mouse photoreceptors do not have calyceal processes so localization to processes cannot be evaluated, but whether the PCDH15 protein is made by photoreceptors can still be assessed.",

At six months of age, mice lacking PCDH15 show moderate (\u02dc50%) reduction of the ERG amplitude (Haywood-Watson et al., 2006; Ahmed et al., 2008). Therefore, restoration of ERG amplitude in Pcdh15R245X/R245X photoreceptors is assessed six months after injection. The ERG amplitude is restored to nearly normal level.",

Zebrafish are an excellent model for studying Usher syndrome in the retina. The zebrafish retina is more like the human retina than is the mouse: zebrafish and human retinas have mostly cone photoreceptors (cone-dominated retina; 40% rods and 60% cones) (FIG. 4A), whereas mice have mostly rods. Zebrafish and human photoreceptors have calyceal processes, whereas mice do not. A further advantage is that zebrafish have functional retinas just 7 days after the egg is fertilized and retinas in the Pcdh15b knockout fish show pathology by that age, compared to six months in mice, so testing would be far faster and cheaper. They have the same USH genes and USH gene mutations produce retinal cell death. Phillips and Westerfield used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to delete Pcdh15b in zebrafish. WT and KO larva are shown in FIG. 4B. An electroretinogram of early development in WT larvae is shown in FIG. 4C. A robust ERG is present just 5-6 days after fertilization of the egg. Overall visual function with the opto-kinetic reflex (OKR) assay (FIG. 4D).",

Wild-type zebra fish showed well-formed parallel calyceal processes (arrows) surround the outer segments of photoreceptors (right panel shows higher magnification). Mutant zebra fish showed fewer processes with un-uniform diameter, and sometimes branched morphology. Outer segments are disorganized. Dual-AAV vector encoding the full-length PCDH15 is injected to Zebra fish retina using at the one-cell stage. Gene expression will be restricted to retinal photoreceptors by driving expression with the cone-specific ProA7 promoter. Rescue of function at 7 days post-fertilization is tested. The development of the retina is evaluated with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and retinal function is tested with ERG recording. Overall visual function with the opto-kinetic reflex (OKR), in which immobilized zebrafish will follow a moving visual pattern by moving their eyes",

PCDH15 expression is assessed in photoreceptor cells. Toxicity by ERG and histopathology is also evaluated. Subretinal injections of AAVs encoding epitope-tagged PCDH15 under the cone-specific ProA7 promoter is performed. After three weeks, animals are euthanized, and retinas obtained for histological analysis. Protein expression and localization to calyceal processes is assessed with an antibody to the epitope tag, to specifically label the delivered PCDH15 protein and distinguish it from endogenous. Immune response is evaluated by evaluating multifocal mononuclear cell infiltration. Toxicity is tested both with histology and with physiology. The ERG is measured from both eyes before the injection, and then just before euthanasia."

Hair bundles were labeled with phalloidin and antibody to the HA tag. With confocal imaging, strong anti-HA signal was detected at the tips of stereocilia in cochleas at ages P6 and P30 (FIGS. 6A and 6B). Immunogold SEM was also used to localize the HA-PCDH15 to the tips of outer hair cell stereocilia. Gold beads localized specifically at the position of the tip links (FIG. 6C). Multiple 12 nm gold beads (white dots) were detected in the SEM imaging, confirming that HA-tagged PCDH15 goes to the tips of stereocilia, and hence that the HA epitope tag does not adversely affect PCDH15 trafficking to the tips of the stereocilia."
