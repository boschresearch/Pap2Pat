    "abstract": "A method for maintaining a dialogue state associated with a dialogue between a user and a digital system includes receiving, by a dialogue state tracker associated with the digital system, a representation of a user communication, updating, by the dialogue state tracker, the dialogue state and providing a system response based on the updated dialogue state. The dialogue state is updated by evaluating, based on the representation of the user communication, a plurality of member scores corresponding to a plurality of ontology members of an ontology set, and selecting, based on the plurality of member scores, zero or more of the plurality of ontology members to add to or remove from the dialogue state. The dialogue state tracker includes a global-local encoder that includes a global branch and a local branch, the global branch having global trained parameters that are shared among the plurality of ontology members and the local branch having local trained parameters that are determined separately for each of the plurality of ontology members.",

                        "Neural networks have demonstrated great promise as a technique for automatically analyzing real-world information with human-like accuracy. In general, neural network models receive input information and make predictions based on the input information. For example, a neural network classifier may predict a class of the input information among a predetermined set of classes. Whereas other approaches to analyzing real-world information may involve hard-coded processes, statistical analysis, and/or the like, neural networks learn to make predictions gradually, by a process of trial and error, using a machine learning process. A given neural network model may be trained using a large number of training examples, proceeding iteratively until the neural network model begins to consistently make similar inferences from the training examples that a human might make. Neural network models have been shown to outperform and/or have the potential to outperform other computing techniques in a number of applications. Indeed, some applications have even been identified in which neural networking models exceed human-level performance."

                        "Dialogue state tracking is one class of problems to which neural networks may be applied. In dialogue state tracking applications, a user engages in a dialogue with an interactive digital system, such as a digital assistant, chatbot, a task-oriented dialogue system (e.g., a restaurant reservation system), and/or the like. To keep track of various objectives expressed by the user and/or responsive actions taken by the digital system over the course of the dialogue, the digital system includes or is associated with a dialogue state tracker that maintains a dialogue state associated with the dialogue. In particular, the dialogue state tracker may include a neural network model for updating the dialogue state at each exchange of the dialogue. For example, suppose a user asks the digital system \u201cFind me a good restaurant on the south side of town.\u201d Suppose further that the digital system replies \u201cCheap or expensive?\u201d to which the user replies \u201cCheap. Can you give me the phone number?\u201d In this scenario, the dialogue state tracker should maintain a comprehensive representation of the dialogue state that is cumulative of the dialogue up to that point (e.g., the user has requested a phone number of a restaurant that is cheap and on the south side of town).",
                        "The performance of dialogue state trackers may be compared or benchmarked by testing different models on a shared dataset, such as, for example, a dataset from the Dialogue System Technology Challenges (DSTC) series of shared tasks. Illustrative examples of tasks that adhere to the DTSC framework include the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) restaurant reservation task and the DSTC2 task. The accuracy of each model may be measured by evaluating one or more metrics, such as cumulative goal accuracy (e.g., the percentage of user goals correctly identified, determined cumulatively over the exchanges in a dialogue), turn request accuracy (the percentage of user requests correctly identified in a given exchanges of the dialogue), and/or the like. State of art dialogue state trackers achieve less than or equal to 73.4% cumulative goal accuracy and less than or equal to 96.6% turn request accuracy on DSTC2, and less than or equal to 84.4% cumulative goal accuracy and less than or equal to 91.6% turn request accuracy on WoZ. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop neural network models for dialogue state trackers that achieve higher accuracy than current state of art dialogue state trackers.",
                        "FIG. 1A is a simplified diagram of a digital system 100 with dialogue state tracking according to some embodiments. According to some embodiments, a user 110 may engage in a dialogue with digital system 100. For example, user 110 may communicate with digital system 100 using any suitable form of communication, including verbal communication (e.g., spoken utterances), written communication (e.g., alphanumeric text and/or symbols), visual communication (e.g., gestures), and/or the like.

Although processor 122 may include one or more general purpose central processing units (CPUs), processor 122 may additionally or alternately include at least one processor that provides accelerated performance when evaluating neural network models. For example, processor 122 may include a graphics processing unit (GPU), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a tensor processing unit (TPU), a digital signal processor (DSP), a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) processor, and/or the like. Generally, such processors may accelerate various computing tasks associated with evaluating neural network models (e.g., training, prediction, preprocessing, and/or the like) by an order of magnitude or more in comparison to a general purpose CPU.",

At each exchange of the dialogue (e.g., at each communication received from user 110 and/or system response provided by digital system 100), dialogue state tracker 130 may update dialogue state 132. For example, dialogue state 132 may be updated to include one or more goals and/or requests expressed by user 110 over the course of the dialogue. Additionally or alternately, dialogue state tracker 130 may maintain a context 134. For example, context 134 may include a history of one or more previous system responses by digital system 100 (e.g., previous actions taken), which provide context for a current communication received from user 110.",

For example, when user 110 expresses a desire to find a cheap restaurant, dialogue state tracker 130 may add the slot-value pair \u201cprice range=cheap\u201d to dialogue state 132. Similarly, dialogue state tracker 130 may determine zero or more ontology members to remove or replace in dialogue state 132. For example, dialogue state tracker 130 may replace the slot-value pair \u201cprice range=expensive\u201d with \u201cprice range=cheap\u201d if user 110 previously expressed a desire for an expensive restaurant, but then changed the preference to a cheap restaurant.",

Scoring model 150 may correspond to a neural network model that is evaluated by processor 122. In particular, scoring model 150 may include a plurality of neural network layers. Examples of neural network layers include densely connected layers, convolutional layers, recurrent layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and/or the like. In some embodiments, scoring model 150 may include at least one hidden layer that is not directly connected to either an input or an output of the neural network. Scoring model 150 may further include a plurality of model parameters (e.g., weights and/or biases) that are learned according to a machine learning process.

                        "One challenge associated with local trained parameters is that the use of local trained parameters limits the number of training examples in which the corresponding ontology member occurs. The challenge is particularly exacerbated for ontology members that occur rarely in practice (e.g., users may rarely request to eat at expensive restaurants, meaning training data sets tend to include very few examples in which a user communication expresses such a request). Large ontology sets are also likely to include a large number of ontology members, each of which is individually unlikely to occur in a given turn, but at least one of which is collectively likely to occur in a given turn. For example, a travel reservation system may be configured to handle requests for vast number of potential travel destinations around the world. Accordingly, the likelihood that a user's request identifies at least one destination is high, but the likelihood that the requested destination is a particular destination (e.g., \u201cParis, France\u201d) among all possible destinations is low. The problem may be quantified with reference to particular training data sets. For example, in the WoZ state tracking data set, although each slot-value pair occurs in 214.9 training examples on average, the set includes a number of rare slot-value pairs exist that occur in less than 20 training examples. Moreover, although such rare slot-value pairs are individually uncommon, they collectively occur frequently: 38.6% of turns in the WoZ dataset have a goal that contains a rare (fewer than 20 training examples) slot-value pair.",
                        "To address this challenge, encoder 300 may include global trained parameters that are shared among the ontology members of the ontology set. The use of global trained parameters may improve the performance of encoder 300, particularly with respect to rarely occurring ontology members, by expanding the scope of the training process to the full ontology set. However, overall accuracy may decline when using global trained parameters, as the global trained parameters are not tuned to particular ontology members.",
