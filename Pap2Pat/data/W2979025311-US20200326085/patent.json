                        "In buildings, thermal management is important for both energy consideration and thermal comfort. Thermal management to limit heat transfer through the building envelope (walls, roof, and foundation) has traditionally been performed with insulation materials. Alternative methods have been proposed, including an emphasis on thermal mass, solar control and shading, and ventilation. Vacuum insulation panels and aerogels are among a new generation of high-performance insulation materials being investigated. These materials can provide higher thermal resistance compared to current foam and fibrous insulation materials, but suffer from high cost, low durability, and diminishing savings. Accordingly, there remains a continued need for new thermal management systems for building envelopes, and in particular, thermal management systems that can be dynamically controlled to reduce peak energy demand, shape energy use, and redirect heat for thermal energy harvesting or thermal storage in existing and new buildings. Previously proposed dynamic systems primarily focus on controlling the heat transfer rate through the envelope by changing their thermal resistance, but are not able to redirect heat."

                        "In one embodiment, the thermal management system includes an anisotropic composite that is made of alternating layer(s) of thermal insulation material and thin layer(s) of thermally conductive material. The thermal management system also includes a thermal loop that serves as heat sink or source along a long edge or the entire perimeter of the anisotropic composite. The temperature of the fluid circulating in the thermal loop (referred to as fluid hereafter) is either dynamically controlled or is let to float. During cooling periods, the fluid in the thermal loop is maintained at a temperature that is lower than that of the outdoor ambient temperature. When the outdoor ambient temperature reaches a building balance point temperature (the building balance point temperature is the outdoor air temperature when the heat gains of the building are equal to the heat losses), for example, 12.78\u00b0 C. (55\u00b0 F.), the thermal loop can stop circulating a cooling fluid (i.e., temperature of the fluid is lower than outdoor air temperature) and optionally switches to circulating a heating fluid (i.e., temperature of the fluid is greater than outdoor air temperature).",
                        "In another embodiment, the thermal management system operates as part of the ceiling, roof, or ground floor to dynamically redirect, reduce, and/or shape heat transfer through the building envelope. The thin layer(s) of thermally conductive material includes a thickness of between 5 microns and 500 microns, inclusive, further optionally about 100 microns, and the polyisocyanurate foam or any insulation board includes a thickness of between 0.25 inches and 7 inches, inclusive, further optionally 0.5 inches. The thermal loop can include a pipe (e.g., copper, crosslinked polyethylene (PEX)) for circulating a fluid at a dynamically controlled or floating temperature. The thermal loop can switch between a heat sink mode and a heat source mode depending on the outdoor ambient temperature and can turn off circulation at other times. As set forth below, finite element heat transfer simulations and large-scale laboratory experiments of the thermal management system of the present invention demonstrated the feasibility of greater than 20% reductions in envelope-related cooling energy with a negligible increase in wall thickness when compared to a wall with exterior continuous insulation. The embodiments of the present invention are well suited for both new constructions and existing constructions across a variety of climates to (1) significantly reduce envelope-generated heating and cooling loads and (2) provide grid services such as decreasing peak loads and shaping energy use.",
                        "Energy from the thermal loop can be harvested and used for domestic hot water systems, heat pump systems, thermoelectric cloth dryers, or any appliances and equipment that needs thermal energy. Energy from the thermal loop can also be harvested and stored in thermal energy storage systems that use phase-change materials, chemical energy storage, or other thermal energy storage systems to use the thermal energy at later time. If no device is available to utilize the harvested thermal energy, it can be discarded in the ground or outdoor air. To operate the thermal loop as heat source, waist heat from appliances, equipment, and/or ground can be utilized.",

                        "Referring to FIG. 1, a thermal management system for a building envelope component is illustrated and generally designated 10. Though illustrated as a wall component, the thermal management system 10 is also suitable for use as a roof component and as a ground floor component. The thermal management system 10 generally includes an anisotropic composite 12 and a thermal loop 14 in thermal communication with the anisotropic composite 12 to re-direct, reduce, and shape heat flows through a building envelope. Each such feature of the thermal management system 10 is discussed below.",
                        "The thermal management system 10 includes an anisotropic composite 12. As used herein, an \u201canisotropic composite\u201d means a composite whose thermal conductivity is anisotropic, such that its in-plane thermal conductivity differs from its through-plane thermal conductivity. In the illustrated embodiment, the thermal conductivity (W/(m\u00b7K)) of the anisotropic composite 12 is greater in-plane than through-plane. To achieve this anisotropic thermal conductivity, the composite 12 is composed of alternating layers of a thermally conductive material 16 and an insulating material 18. The conductive material 16 is placed on the insulating material 18, being aluminum in the present embodiment, optionally with a thickness of between 5 microns and 500 microns, inclusive, further optionally 100 microns. The conductive material 16 can include other materials in other embodiments, for example copper foil. The insulating material 18 includes a polyisocyanurate foam board in the current embodiment. In other embodiments, the insulating material 18 includes rigid extruded polystyrene (XPS) or other foam insulation, for example extruded polystyrene foam, while in still other embodiments the insulating core material 18 can include fibrous insulation materials, for example polyester fibers or glass fibers. The composite 12 includes insulation boards a thickness of between 0.25 inches and 7 inches, inclusive, further optionally 0.5 inches.",
                        "Each anisotropic composite 12 is composed of alternating layers of an insulating material 18 and a thermally conductive material 16, which, during the cooling season, draws heat in-plane toward the thermal loop 14 and decreases the through-plane (inward) heat transfer to the building interior. The thermal management system 10 includes an anisotropic composite with three alternating layers of conductive and insulating materials 12 that are in contact with each other in the present embodiment. The anisotropic composite can be made of greater or fewer alternating layers of conductive and insulating materials in other embodiments. The thermal loop 14 is disposed along the side of the anisotropic composite 12, in direct contact with the edge of the conductive material 16. In other embodiments, the thermal loop 14 is disposed within a portion of the composite 12, between adjacent conductive materials, being entirely self-contained within the composite 12. In still other embodiments, one or more thermal loops 14 are disposed distal from the edges (as shown in FIG. 8), entirely within the interior of a panel 12. The thermal loop 14 operates as a heat sink when the building needs cooling and operates as a heat source when building needs heating. The thermal loop 14 extends along the long edge or the entire perimeter of the anisotropic composite 12.",
                        "In the current embodiment, the thermal loop 14 includes one or more copper pipes 20 circulating water 22 (depicted in box 14 in FIG. 1) at a dynamically controlled temperature. One pipe 20 is shown in FIG. 1, but a greater number of pipes 20 can be used if desired, for example one pipe 20 for each thermally conductive material (e.g., one copper pipe for each aluminum facing). When operating in a cooling mode, the water temperature within the thermal loop is regulated to be about 10\u00b0 C. lower than the outdoor ambient temperature. When operating in a heating mode, the water temperature within the thermal loop is regulated to be about 10\u00b0 C. greater than the outdoor ambient temperature. The same pipes 22 are used for both cooling and heating. In cooling operations, the thermal loop 14 runs water at 10\u00b0 C. less than the outdoor ambient temperature until the outdoor air temperature is 12.78\u00b0 C. (55\u00b0 F.), and thereafter turns off. Below this building balance point temperature, the thermal loop 14 is optionally switched to a heat source 14 with temperatures 10\u00b0 C. higher than outdoor temperatures. The thermal loop 14 is optionally operated in accordance with a closed feedback loop, in which a control action (e.g., control of thermal loop temperature) is determined by comparing a measured value (e.g., the temperature of the cooling fluid) with a reference value (e.g., outdoor ambient temperature minus a buffer, for example 10\u00b0 C.). The resulting difference creates an error signal, which is used to raise or lower the temperature of the cooling fluid to maintain a temperature of approximately 10\u00b0 C. below ambient. Though described above as circulating water, the thermal loop 14 can circulate other fluids (e.g., glycol, refrigerant) and temperature differences as desired. The thermal loop optionally uses Earth ground for regulating the temperature of the fluid 22. The outdoor ambient temperature measurements can be made periodically on an hourly basis, and as noted above, the building balance point temperature can be 55\u00b0 F. or some other value as desired.",
                        "The thermal management system 10 is disposed between conventional building materials along an exterior of the building structure. As shown in FIG. 1 for example, a 0.25\u2033 stucco 24 is spaced apart from a wall structure comprising oriented strand board (OSB) 26, cavity insulation 28, wood studs 30, and drywall 32. Though shown as part of a wall structure, the thermal management system 10 can constitute part of roofs or ground floors. The components of the anisotropic composite 12 can be pre-bonded to each other as a single construction, or separately applied to the OSB 26. Alternatively, the thermal management system 10 can be disposed between conventional building materials along the interior of the building structure.",
                        "A method for installing the thermal management system 10 for new constructions or as a retrofit includes positioning the anisotropic composite 12 between a wall structure (or roof structure) and its exterior cladding 24. The anisotropic composite 12 comprises of alternating layers of an insulating material, for example polyisocyanurate foam, and a thermally conductive material, for example aluminum sheets. Three alternating layers of 0.5-inch-thick insulation boards and 0.04-inch-thick aluminum sheets are used at each wall section, but greater or fewer panels and panels of varying thicknesses can be used in other embodiments. Once secured to the wall structure, for example OSB 26 that is opposite cavity insulation 28, the method includes running a thermal loop 14 along the long edge or the entire perimeter of the composite 12. The method then includes applying the outer cladding to the outermost layer of the composite 12. The method further includes operating the thermal loop 14 in a cooling mode to maintain its temperature lower than the outdoor ambient temperature or operating the thermal loop 14 in a heating mode to maintain it at greater than the outdoor ambient temperature. In some operations, the thermal loop 14 turns off. Below a building balance point temperature, the thermal loop can be switched to a heat source with temperatures 10 C higher than outdoor temperatures."

The room temperature was allowed to float between assumed heating and cooling set points (20-23.3\u00b0 C. or 69-74\u00b0 F.). Internal heat gains and losses were calculated at the interior surface of the wall. As shown in FIG. 3, calculated cooling loads were reduced by 69% with the PIR-Al composite as compared to the baseline 2\u2033 PR.

FIG. 5 compares the calculated heat flux (W/m2) on an hourly basis from annual simulations for a west-facing wall using Phoenix, Ariz., weather data. The differences in peak heat gains are readily observable. For FIG. 6, the same results are plotted for CI, PIR-Al(1), and PIR-Al(2) for shorter time periods during winter and summer. Both PIR-Al(1) and PIR-Al(2) geometries showed reduced peak summer heat gains compared to CI. During winter modeling, the PIR-Al(2) geometry showed lower peak heat losses compared to PIR-Al(1). Similar reductions in calculated peak gains during summer months were observed in simulation results using weather conditions from Baltimore, Md. FIG. 7 shows the calculated heat fluxes through a north-facing wall in Baltimore during winter and summer periods. Of note, for PIR-Al(3), the heat sink temperature was 10\u00b0 C. lower than outdoor temperatures when the outdoor temperature was higher than 12.78\u00b0 C. Below this building balance point temperature, the heat sink was switched to a heat source with temperatures 10\u00b0 C. higher than outdoor temperatures. All PIR-Al geometries showed a similar reduction in summertime peak heat games compared to the CI geometry. The simulation results show that with a suitable thermal loop, significant reductions in both heating and cooling loads can be obtained compared to the baseline scenario and even the CI geometry."

The meter chamber was surrounded on five sides by the guard chamber except for the side facing up, which is exposed to the test specimen. During testing, the edge of the meter chamber is sealed against the indoor side of the wall assembly and provides a measurement of the total heat flow through the 2.44 m\u00d72.44 m central measurement area of the test specimen. The LSCS serves as a guarded hot box apparatus and testing was performed in according with ASTM C1363.

Next, the baseline wall was upgraded by adding three layers of 1.3 cm thick XPS as exterior insulation to create the \u201cBase+XPS\u201d test wall. Finally, a third test wall (\u201cBase+TAC\u201d) was created by adding the TAC and Cu tubes to the baseline wall. Under summer conditions, the peak cooling loads were reduced by 43.4% with the \u201cBase+XPS\u201d wall and by 79.5% with the \u201cBase+TAC\u201d wall compared to the \u201cBase\u201d wall. Under winter conditions, the reductions in peak heating loads were 42.1% and 63.7% with the \u201cBase+XPS\u201d and \u201cBase+TAC\u201d walls, respectively. FIG. 10 compares the integrated cooling and heating loads over 72-hour summer and winter periods and the percent reductions in the loads with the addition of XPS only and the TAC+thermal loop to the baseline wall. The results showed that thermal anisotropic composite connected with a thermal loop can significantly outperform insulation materials of similar thickness. Under summer conditions, \u201cBase+TAC\u201d doubled the decrease in cooling loads compared to \u201cBase+XPS.\u201d Under winter conditions, \u201cBase+TAC\u201d increased the reduction in heating loads by 40% compared to \u201cBase+XPS.\u201d",
