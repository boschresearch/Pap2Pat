However, these methods are poor in reliability and give variation in diagnosis resulting from individual assessments or different assessment methods in medical institutes. In recent years, molecular diagnosis based on a gene or protein expressed in living bodies is examined as a standardized cancer diagnostic method with less variation in diagnosis by diagnosticians. As molecular diagnosis based on protein, various methods using a cyclin dependent kinase (also referred to hereinafter as \u201cCDK\u201d) have been proposed.",

According to this method, a risk of cancer recurrence can be predicted based on the CDK specific activity ratio between two CDKs from a cancer patient to be examined."

As a method using no labeling by radioactive substance, there is a method which comprises preparing a sample containing activated CDK of interest from a cell lysate of a subject, reacting the substrate with adenosine 5\u2032-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP-\u03b3S) to introduce monothiophosphate group into serine or threonine residue in the substrate protein, labeling the substrate protein by binding a fluorescent substance or a labeled enzyme to a sulfur atom in the introduced monothiophosphate group, measuring the amount of the labeled thiophosphorylated substrate (or the amount of the fluorescent substance in the case where the fluorescent substance is used), and quantitatively determining the phosphoric acid amount based on a standard curve previously prepared using standard samples.",

In the case where the activity of a specific cyclin dependent kinase (for example, cyclin A dependent kinase, cyclin B dependent kinase or cyclin E dependent kinase) is measured, the sample may be prepared using an anti-cyclin antibody. In both cases, CDK other than activated CDK is contained in the sample. For example, the cyclin-CDK complex to which a CDK inhibitor is bound may also be contained in the sample. When the anti-CDK antibody is used, CDK itself, a CDK-cyclin complex, a CDK-CDK inhibitor complex, and/or complexes of CDK and other compounds are contained. Accordingly, CDK activity value is measured in terms of the unit (U) of the phosphorylated substrate under the condition where various CDKs such as activated CDK, inactivated CDK, and various competitive reactive substances co-exist.",

For example, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a Western blot process may be used. The target protein (CDK) can be captured by using an antibody specific to the target protein.

For example, when the recurrence risk score RRS of a cancer patient to be examined is compared with a threshold value, and when the recurrence risk score (RRS) of the cancer patient to be examined is higher than the threshold value, the risk of cancer recurrence in the cancer patient to be examined can be judged to be high, while when the recurrence risk score (RRS) of the cancer patient to be examined is lower than the threshold value, the risk of cancer recurrence in the cancer patient to be examined can be judged to below, and therefore the risk of cancer recurrence can be judged.",

                                "The threshold value can be established by various methods. For example, tumor cells collected from a plurality of cancer patients having known malignancy grading judged by a medical pathologist are used to calculate the recurrence risk score RRS based on the above formula, and the recurrence risk score RRS by which the patients can be classified into 2 groups wherein one group is recognized to have cancer recurrence and the other group is not recognized to have cancer recurrence can be established as the threshold value. The recurrence risk can be judged to be \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d by judging the possibility of cancer recurrence by the threshold value established in this manner.",
                                "For example, the recurrence risk score RRS by which cancer patients having malignancy grading judged by a medical pathologist can be classified into 2 groups such that 80% of the cancer patients classified by the recurrence risk score RRS are cancer patients recognized to have cancer recurrence can be a threshold value. By establishing the threshold value in this way, the recurrence risk can be judged to be high when the cancer recurrence rate is 80% or higher. Alternatively, a plurality of threshold values may be established for different recurrence rates so that a risk of cancer recurrence can be evaluated and judged in stages.",
                                "The reason that the recurrence risk score RRS can be calculated from the formulas (5) to (7) is herein described.",
                                "First, the meanings of the CDK specific activity and specific activity ratio are described.",
                                "The CDK specific activity is expressed as the CDK activity value/CDK expression level ratio and thus refers to the ratio of the CDK activity value to the expression level. The CDK specific activity is a parameter that reflects the CDK enzyme activity per unit CDK protein mass contained in a sample, corresponds to the ratio of active CDK to CDK occurring in cells, and shows the CDK activity level based on the proliferating state of malignant tumor cells to be judged.",
                                "The specific activity ratio is expressed as the second CDK specific activity/first CDK specific activity ratio and thus refers to the ratio of the second CDK specific activity to the first CDK specific activity. The CDK specific activity ratio is the ratio between the activity levels of two CDKs each exhibiting an activity in a specific cell cycle, and is a parameter that reflects which of the CDK activities in cancer patient's cells is predominant (which degree of cells are in which stage of cell cycle).",
                                "Generally, since a cancer cell is out of normally controlled growth and proliferates rapidly, when the ratio of cells staying in the period between S phase (DNA replicative period) and G2 phase (period of from termination of DNA synthesis to initiation of mitotic division) is high, the cells can be estimated to become cancerous. The aneuploidity is considered to be caused by passing through an abnormal M phase (cell division stage), or proceeding to G1 phase and then S phase without undergoing M phase. Therefore, the sample in which the ratio of cells in M phase is low may be estimated to become cancerous.",
                                "Accordingly, it is preferable that for example, CDK1 showing an activity during shifting from G2 phase to M phase in cell cycle be used as the first CDK, and CDK2 showing an activity during shifting from G1 phase to S stage in cell cycle be used as the second CDK. By determining the CDK specific activity ratio based on these two CDKs, a numerical value reflecting how much the cells in the S or G2 phase occur relative to the cells in the M phase can be obtained. This numerical value can be used as a parameter reflecting the proliferating ability of the cells.",
                                "Then, the formulas (5) to (7) for calculating the recurrence risk score (RRS) are described.",
                                "As illustrated above, parameters correlated with the proliferating ability of cells (risk of cancer recurrence) can be obtained by obtaining the CDK specific activity ratio based on the first CDK specific activity and the second CDK specific activity.",
                                "However, there can be cases where the CDK specific activity ratio is not correlated with the proliferating ability of cells (risk of cancer recurrence). For example, when the CDK specific activity ratio is determined by using CDK1 as the first CDK and CDK2 as the second CDK as illustrated above, the CDK specific activity ratio is low when the CDK1 specific activity is abnormally high. But, from another viewpoint, this low ratio can be also considered attributable to abnormal activation of CDK1 by high expression of cyclin that has formed a complex with CDK1.",
                                "It is considered that even if the amount of CDK activated in a certain cell cycle is low, cells can proliferate by compensatory function of another specific CDK, so abnormal activation of specific CDK can be also considered attributable to abnormal cellular kinetics.",
                                "Accordingly, the inventors have estimated that a risk of cancer recurrence can be determined by two risk factors: (1) first CDK specific activity and (2) second CDK/first CDK specific activity ratio, and they have found a method of evaluating a risk of cancer recurrence based on these risk factors.",
                                "First, the probabilities of cancer recurrence based on the risk factors (1) and (2) respectively are expressed as risk score RS (1) and risk score RS (2) by using numerically evaluated scales. The probabilities of cancer recurrence resulting from the risk factors (1) and (2) are expressed as recurrence risk score RRS by using a numerically evaluated scale. As a consequence, the probability of cancer recurrence, that is, recurrence risk, is given by a product obtained by multiplying the probability of cancer recurrence resulting from the risk factor (1) by the probability of cancer recurrence from the risk factor (2), and therefore, the recurrence risk score (RRS) is given by a value proportional to the product of the risk score RS (1) and the risk score RS (2).
