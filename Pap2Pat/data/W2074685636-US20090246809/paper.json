    "abstract": "In a Japanese study, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) based risk determined by CDK 1 and 2 activities was associated with risk of distance recurrence in early breast cancer patients. The aim of our study was to validate this risk categorization in European early breast cancer patients. We retrospectively analyzed frozen breast cancer specimens of 352 Dutch patients with histologically confirmed primary invasive early breast cancer. CDK-based risk was determined in tumour tissues by calculating a risk score (RS) according to kinases activity and protein mass concentration assay without the knowledge of outcome. Determination of CDK-based risk was feasible in 184 out of 352 (52%) tumours. Median follow-up of these patients was 15 years. In patients not receiving systemic treatment, the proportions of risk categories were 44% low, 16% intermediate, and 40% high CDK-based risk. These groups remained significant after univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. Factors associated with a shorter distant recurrence-free period were positive lymph nodes, mastectomy with radiotherapy, and high CDK-based risk. There was no significant correlation with overall survival (OS). CDK-based risk is a prognostic marker of distance recurrence of patients with early breast cancer. More validation would be warranted to use of CDK-based risk into clinical practice.",

Expression of CDKs was detected quantitatively by sequential reactions with primary anti-CDK antibodies, biotinylated anti-rabbit antibodies, and fluorescein-labelled streptavidin. To measure kinases activity, each CDK molecule was immunoprecipitated from the tissue lysate. The thiophosphate of ATP-\u03b3S was transferred to the protein substrate during the on-bead kinases reaction. The introduced thiophosphate was labelled further with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and blotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The kinases activity was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the blot.",

Besides, recurrences were frequently observed in patients with a tumour with higher CDK1SA. The extent of the aberration was quantified as the ratio of CDK2SA relative to CDK1SA (CDK2SA/CDK1SA). The rate of recurrence monotonically increased with increasing ratio of CDK2SA/CDK1SA or CDK1SA. These plots approximated logistic curves (Equations (1) and (2)) and the RS was defined by combining these relational equations. Setting the cutoff value with the cases of the Japanese study; 40% of the patients in the high RS group, showed a significantly lower recurrence-free survival rate in 5 years after surgery (84.0%; 9 out of 58) compared with 40% of the low RS group (96.5%; 2 out of 58) (P=0.009).

CDK-based risk is a tangible prognostic marker for DRFP.",
                "Currently, risk-assessments with various prognostic and predictive markers are used for indication of systemic treatment, like tumour grade and nodal status for general systemic treatment choice, hormonal receptors for hormonal treatment, and HER2 expression for immunotherapy. However, these assessments are insufficient for optimal therapeutic decision, especially when applied to node-negative early breast cancer patients. Only few of these patients are considered at such a low-risk of relapse that systemic therapy can be avoided. At the same time, not all patients at high-risk experience a recurrence. Therefore, there is demand for more accurate prognostic markers for a more tailored definition of an individual patient's risk of disease recurrence and to identify indications for the best therapy.",
                "In 2007, the American Society of Clinical Oncology Committee recommended the following markers in clinical practice in patients with early breast cancer: ER, PgR, HER2, urokinases plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and certain genes detected with multiparameter gene expression assays (Harris et al, 2007). ER, PgR, and HER2 are widely used and should be determined in every patient with early breast cancer. uPA and PAI-1 are key factors in efficient focal proteolysis, adhesion, and migration of tumour cells (Andreasen et al, 1997; Schmitt et al, 1997; Bouchet et al, 1999; Duffy, 2002; Harbeck et al, 2002). Currently, the prognostic value of uPA and PAI-1 are being examined in the prospective Node-Negative Breast Cancer III (NNBC 3)-Europe Trial (Annecke et al, 2008). As another prognostic tool, the value of microarray-based prognostics and feasibility of its clinical application into clinical practice is in the process of evaluation by two major trials. The first prospective trial is the European Microarray in Node-Negative Disease May Avoid Chemotherapy Trial evaluating MammaPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), a 70-gene expression profile, in node-negative early breast cancer patients (van de Vijver et al, 2002; Cardoso et al, 2008). Its American counterpart, the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment, is aimed at validating Oncotype DX (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, USA), a 21-gene assay, likewise in node-negative patients (Palli et al, 1999; Sparano and Paik, 2008). The Oncotype DX profile can be determined using paraffin-embedded breast tissue; the MammaPrint profile makes use of fresh frozen material. Both profiles must be analysed centrally; no ready-to-use kit is available to determine the profile in local hospitals.",
                "In the ideal clinical trial setting, the above-mentioned prognostic factors, including CDK-based risk, should be determined in the same tumour sample to determine the best marker combination for optimal treatment decisions. Unfortunately it is not likely that such a large, long-lasting and costly trial will be actualised.",
                "From our results, it was shown that validation of CDK-based risk was feasible for European patients even though the RS was determined in Japanese patients. Despite the difference between the cohorts, it may be concluded that CDK-based risk is a new prognostic factor. However, before this CDK-based risk can be used in daily clinical practice, several aspects have to be considered. First issue is the high proportion of exclusion cases in this study; in almost 50% of tumours it was not feasible to determine CDK-based risk. This was related to weaknesses of the assay system, because the accuracy of the expression analysis is influenced by blood and OCT contamination. However, we believe these issues are not significant problems anymore. A washing step before tissue lysis markedly improved the efficacy of CDK expression analysis for cases with \u2a7e20% OCT contamination (data not shown). The crucial issue of the exclusion is low cellularity measured by CDK expression. In our study, 22% (79 out of 352) were excluded because of low cellularity. The Japanese retrospective study, which used snap-frozen tissues, found a lower rate of low cellularity (11%, unpublished data), and this value was judged as a clinically practical value. One challenge is to carefully determine the sufficient amount of a cryosection to apply CDK-based risk on OCT-embedded samples. Secondly, to enable general use for broad application, a feasible ready-to-use kit should be devised including the cell cycle profile system.",
                "In the association analysis of CDK-based risk to clinicopathologic factors, we found significant associations between the CDK-based risk and age, nodal status, and grade. Unexpectedly, a statistically significant association was not observed between CDK-based risk and Ki67 expression, known as a proliferation marker of tumour tissues. This discrepancy may be because of the technical issue of Ki67 immunohistochemistry procedure; the lack of an international standardisation method for antigen retrieval, staining procedures and scoring methods. To further address the significance of CDK-based analysis, cell biological interest for rate of cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution (G1/S/G2M-phase), check point regulation, and CDK-mediated cell death should be examined both in vitro and in vivo.",
                "In conclusion, our results showed that CDK-based risk is prognostic for DRFP in patients with early breast cancer, also after correction with other prognostic factors. Therefore, further studies are justified to develop this as a marker for more tailored treatment of early breast cancer patients."
