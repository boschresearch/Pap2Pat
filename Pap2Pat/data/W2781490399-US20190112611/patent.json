                        "Biofuels and bio-based chemicals derived from lignocellulose are promising alternatives to traditional petroleum-originating fuels and chemicals. The plant cell wall is a complex assembly of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, and proteins (Somerville et al. 2004). Breaking down this heterogeneic substrate into its constituent monomers and oligomers currently requires a combination of physical, chemical, and/or biological deconstruction methods. A variety of chemical pretreatment methods have been explored, including acids, bases, solvents, and oxidation (Silveira et al. 2015). For the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis steps to be both economically and environmentally viable, proteins that can remain active in the presence of residual pretreatment chemicals need to be identified. It would also be beneficial if these enzymes can be produced economically and at a large scale.",
                        "Ionic liquid (IL) solvents are used for biomass pretreatment (Yu et al. 2016). There has been a concerted effort to identify cellulose cocktail components that are IL-tolerant as current commercial mixtures are not. For example, a number of cellulolytic enzymes with thermophilic and IL-tolerant characteristics were identified from a switchgrass-degrading bacterial community (Gladden et al. 2011). However, many of the species producing these enzymes are not easily cultured. The predicted cellulolytic bacterial enzymes were produced either in vitro or from Escherichia coli in order to characterize their activity over a range of temperature, pH, and IL concentration (Gladden et al. 2014). To produce these enzymes at a larger scale, these sequences were cloned into the fungal host, Aspergillus niger (Campen et al.).",
                        "Filamentous fungi are commonly used for the commercial production of chemicals and enzymes. The ability of A. niger to grow aerobically over a wide range of both temperatures and pHs is advantageous in industrial settings (Schuster et al. 2002; Oliveira et al. 2001). In addition, the organism is non-pathogenic and does not produce the mycotoxins that are common in some other related fungal species. It is therefore categorized as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the US Food and Drug Administration, meaning that substances generated using A. niger are considered harmless as food additives (Schuster et al. 2002, van Dijck et al. 2003). Because of its established use in industry, numerous large-scale fermentation protocols for A. niger exist. Finally, A. niger has a well-developed molecular toolbox, including various auxotrophic and antifungal resistance markers, a fully sequenced genome, and various transformation protocols, thus making it conducive to genetic manipulation."

                        "A forward mutagenesis strategy was used to identify methods to enhance heterologous enzyme production in A. niger. A strain engineered to produce one of the IL-tolerant bacterial j3-glucosidases (BGs) was subjected to chemical mutagenesis and the resulting strains screened for increased enzyme production. Subsequent whole-genome resequencing of a dozen hyper-production mutants identified hundreds of genetic lesions, and bioinformatics analysis revealed several loci potentially associated with heterologous enzyme hyper-production, including those that appear to be specific to the heterologous protein expression construct used. One of the identified loci was annotated as a low-affinity glucose transporter, mstC. It is shown herein that the deletion of mstC improves the heterologous enzyme production driven by a glucoamylase promoter (PglaA), some examples by at least four-fold. This allows for increased production of heterologous proteins by Aspergillus species such as A. aculeatus, A. awamori, A. brasiliensis, A. carbonarius, A. flavus, A. foetidus, A. fumigatus, A. furnigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. oryzae, A. pseudoterreus, A. sojae, A. terreus, A. tubingensis, and A. wentii for industrial use. In addition, functional deletion of mstC increased glucoamylase production. Amylolytic enzymes are critical to ethanol production and methods to increase amylolytic enzymes can be used to decrease enzyme production costs.",
                        "Based on these observations, provided herein are isolated fungi, such as those in the class Eurotiomycetes (e.g., Aspergillus, such as A. niger) or Sordariomycetes (e.g., Neurospora or Glomerella, such as N. crassa) a species of, which include a genetic inactivation of a mstC gene or a homolog thereof, such as NCU01633. Such fungi can be recombinant (e.g., non-naturally occurring). In some examples, the mstC gene is genetically inactivated by nonsynonymous mutation or by insertional mutation. In some examples, the mstC gene that is genetically inactivated was a nucleic acid molecule having at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3 or to nt 82 to 1764 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (e.g., prior to its inactivation). In some examples, the mstC gene that is genetically inactivated encoded a protein comprising at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% amino acid sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 2 (e.g., prior to its inactivation). In some examples, the mstC homolog that is genetically inactivated is a NCU01633 gene, such as nucleic acid molecule having at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10 or to nt 652 to 2250 of SEQ ID NO: 10 (e.g., prior to its inactivation). In some examples, the NCU01633 gene that is genetically inactivated encoded a protein comprising at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% amino acid sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 11 (e.g., prior to its inactivation). Fungi containing a genetically inactivated mstC or homolog thereof can further include a glucoamylase promoter (e.g., a nucleic acid molecule having at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 8) operably linked to a heterologous (i.e., non-native) protein coding sequence, such as a heterologous enzyme (e.g., beta-glucosidase (BG), glycoside hydrolase, carbohydrate esterase, protease, lipase, liginase, cellulase, or hemicellulase), chimeric protein that includes a secreting signal sequence, or a chimeric protein including glucoamylase linked to a protein of interest. Such fungi can produce or express the heterologous protein. In some examples, fungi containing a genetically inactivated mstC or homolog thereof can further include one or more mutations in an AmyR gene, a mutation in an CreA gene, or both, wherein the mutations decrease expression and/or activity of AmyR and/or CreA.",

Such methods can include culturing one or more isolated (e.g., recombinant) fungi disclosed herein, under conditions that permit the fungus having a genetically inactivated mstC gene or homolog thereof and a heterologous protein coding sequence operably linked to a glucoamlyase promoter, to express the heterologous protein, thereby expressing the heterologous protein. In some examples, expression of a heterologous protein, such as a heterologous enzyme, is increased by at least 2-fold, such as at least 3-fold, or at least 4-fold, as compared to expression of the heterologous enzyme in a fungus containing a native (e.g., non-mutated and functional) mstC gene or homolog thereof.",

For example, such methods can include incubating the biomass with one or more fungi disclosed herein having a genetically inactivated mstC gene (or homolog thereof) and a heterologous protein coding sequence operably linked to a glucoamlyase promoter, under conditions that permit the fungus to express the heterologous protein (e.g., BG or other protein in Table 1) from the glucoamylase promoter, thereby degrading the biomass. In other examples, the method includes incubating a biomass with one or more heterologous proteins (e.g., BG or other enzyme or protein listed in Table 1, or combinations thereof, such as one or more heterologous proteins that can degrade the biomass) obtained from the AmstC fungi that include a glucoamylase promoter operably linked to a heterologous protein (for example enzymes secreted in the growth media of the mutant fungi and collected or isolated) under conditions that permit the secreted heterologous protein to degrade the biomass. For example, the biomass can be incubated with the one or more heterologous proteins in an appropriate liquid material, at an appropriate temperature and pH. The heterologous protein(s) obtained from the AmstC fungi degrade the biomass. Thus, the method can further include culturing the AmstC fungi and separating or isolating the heterologous protein(s) expressed in and secreted by the AmstC mutant strain, and then adding the separated heterologous protein(s) to the biomass. In some examples, the method further includes incubating the biomass with one or more ionic liquids, including, but not limited to, ethyl methylimidazolium acetate, cholinium lysinate, cholinium alpha-ketoglutarate, or combinations thereof.",

Different types of cells can respond differently to an identical signal. Expression of a gene also can be regulated anywhere in the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein. Regulation can include controls on transcription, translation, RNA transport and processing, degradation of intermediary molecules such as mRNA, or through activation, inactivation, compartmentalization or degradation of specific protein molecules after they are produced. In an example, the disclosed fungi having a genetically inactivated mstC gene (referred to as \u0394mstC) and a glucoamylase promoter operably linked to a heterologous protein coding sequence can be used to express the heterologous gene or protein (such as BG).",

The percent sequence identity is determined by dividing the number of matches either by the length of the sequence set forth in the identified sequence, or by an articulated length (e.g., 100 consecutive nucleotides or amino acid residues from a sequence set forth in an identified sequence), followed by multiplying the resulting value by 100. For example, a nucleic acid sequence that has 1166 matches when aligned with a test sequence having 1554 nucleotides is 75.0 percent identical to the test sequence (i.e., 1166\u00f71554*100=75.0). The percent sequence identity value is rounded to the nearest tenth. For example, 75.11, 75.12, 75.13, and 75.14 are rounded down to 75.1, while 75.15, 75.16, 75.17, 75.18, and 75.19 are rounded up to 75.2. The length value will always be an integer. In another example, a target sequence containing a 20-nucleotide region that aligns with 20 consecutive nucleotides from an identified sequence as follows contains a region that shares 75 percent sequence identity to that identified sequence (i.e., 15-20*100=75).",

The mutation can act through affecting transcription or translation of the gene or its mRNA, or the mutation can affect the polypeptide product itself in such a way as to render it substantially inactive.",
                                "Genetic inactivation of one or more genes (can be referred to as functional deletion) can be performed using any conventional method. In one example, a strain of Aspergillus or other fungus is transformed with a vector which has the effect of down-regulating or otherwise inactivating an mstC gene or homolog thereof. For example, control elements such as promoters and the like which control gene expression can be mutated, the coding region of the gene can be mutated so that any protein expressed is substantially inactive, or the mstC gene or homolog thereof can be deleted entirely. For example, an mstC gene or homolog thereof can be functionally deleted by complete or partial deletion mutation (for example by deleting a portion of the coding region of the gene), by insertional mutation (for example by inserting nucleotides into the coding region of the gene, such as a molecule of about 1-5000 nucleotides), or combinations thereof. Thus, the disclosure in some examples provides transformed or recombinant fungi that include at least one exogenous nucleic acid molecule which genetically inactivates an mstC gene (such as mutates the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3) or a homolog thereof (such as mutates the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 or 10). In one example, such a transformed fungus produces increased amounts of a heterologous protein, for example relative to a comparable fungus with a native, non-mutated mstC sequence or homolog thereof.",
                                "In one example, an insertional mutation includes introduction of a nucleic acid molecule that is in multiples of three bases (e.g., a sequence of 3, 9, 12, or 15 nucleotides) to reduce the possibility that the insertion will affect downstream genes. Mutations can also be generated through insertion of a foreign gene sequence, for example the insertion of a gene encoding antibiotic resistance (such as hygromycin or bleomycin) into the mstC gene or homolog thereof.",

In particular examples, about 5% to about 100% of the gene is deleted, such as at least 20% of the gene, at least 40% of the gene, at least 75% of the gene, or at least 90% of the mstC gene. In particular examples, about 5% to about 100% of the coding region is deleted, such as at least 20% of the coding region, at least 40% of the coding region, at least 75% of the coding region, or at least 90% of the mstC coding region (e.g., the coding region of shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, namely nt 82 to 1764 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or the coding region of shown in SEQ ID NO: 10, namely nt 652 to 2250 of SEQ ID NO: 10).",

In this technique, a double selection strategy is employed wherein a plasmid is constructed encoding both a selectable and counterselectable marker, with flanking DNA sequences derived from both sides of the desired deletion. The selectable marker is used to select for fungi in which the plasmid has integrated into the genome in the appropriate location and manner. The counterselecteable marker is used to select for the very small percentage of fungi that have spontaneously eliminated the integrated plasmid. A fraction of these fungi will then contain only the desired deletion with no other foreign DNA present.",
                                "In another technique, the cre-lox system is used for site specific recombination of DNA (for example see Steiger et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 77(1): 114, 2011). The system includes 34 base pair lox sequences that are recognized by the bacterial cre recombinase gene. If the lox sites are present in the DNA in an appropriate orientation, DNA flanked by the lox sites will be excised by the cre recombinase, resulting in the deletion of all sequences except for one remaining copy of the lox sequence. Using recombination techniques, the targeted gene (e.g., mstC or homolog thereof) can be deleted in the Aspergillus genome and replaced with a selectable marker (for example a gene coding for kanamycin or other antibiotic resistance) that is flanked by the lox sites. Transient expression (e.g., by electroporation of a suicide plasmid containing the cre gene under control of a promoter that functions in Aspergillus or other fungus) of the cre recombinase efficiently eliminates the lox flanked marker. This process can produce a mutant fungi containing the desired deletion mutation of mstC or homolog thereof and one copy of the lox sequence.",
                                "In another example, an mstC gene sequence (or homolog thereof) in a fungal genome is replaced with a marker gene, such as one encoding for green fluorescent protein, j3-galactosidase, or luciferase. In this technique, DNA segments flanking a desired deletion are prepared by PCR and cloned into a suicide (non-replicating) vector for the fungus. An expression cassette, containing a promoter active in the fungus and the appropriate marker gene, is cloned between the flanking sequences. The plasmid is introduced into wild-type fungi. Fungi that incorporate and express the marker gene are isolated and examined for the appropriate recombination event (replacement of the wild type mstC gene with the marker gene).",
                                "Thus, for example, a fungal cell can be engineered to have a disrupted mstC gene (or homolog thereof) using mutagenesis or knock-out technology.

USA 97: 6640-5, 2000; and Dai et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70(4):2474-85, 2004).",
                                "In another example, antisense technology is used to reduce or eliminate the activity of mstC (or homolog thereof). For example, a fungal cell can be engineered to contain a cDNA that encodes an antisense molecule that prevents mstC from being translated. The term \u201cantisense molecule\u201d encompasses any nucleic acid molecule or nucleic acid analog (e.g., peptide nucleic acids) that contains a sequence that corresponds to the coding strand of an endogenous mstC gene (or homolog thereof). An antisense molecule also can have flanking sequences (e.g., regulatory sequences). Thus, antisense molecules can be ribozymes or antisense oligonucleotides. A ribozyme can have any general structure including, without limitation, hairpin, hammerhead, or axehead structures, provided the molecule cleaves RNA. Further, gene silencing can be used to reduce the activity of mstC.",

Genet. 18:7-12, 1990; Sambrook et al., Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, New York, USA, third edition, 2001; and Becker and Guarente, Methods in Enzymology 194:182-7, 1991). An exogenous nucleic acid molecule contained within a particular cell of the disclosure can be maintained within that cell in any form. For example, exogenous nucleic acid molecules can be integrated into the genome of the cell or maintained in an episomal state. That is, the recombinant fungi cells can be a stable or transient transformant.",

                                "A fungus having an inactivated mstC gene (or homolog thereof) can be identified using any known method. For example, PCR and nucleic acid hybridization techniques, such as Northern and Southern analysis, can be used to confirm that a fungus has an inactivated mstC gene (or homolog thereof). Alternatively, real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) can be used for detection and quantification of targeted messenger RNA, such as mRNA of mstC gene (or homolog thereof) in the parent and mutant strains as grown at the same culture conditions. Immunohisto-chemical and biochemical techniques can also be used to determine if a cell expresses mstC (or homolog thereof) by detecting the expression of the mstC protein (or homolog thereof) encoded by mstC (or homolog thereof). For example, an antibody having specificity for mstC (or homolog thereof) can be used to determine whether or not a particular fungus contains a functional nucleic acid encoding mstC protein (or homolog thereof). Further, biochemical techniques can be used to determine if a cell contains a particular gene inactivation by detecting a product produced as a result of the expression of the peptide.",

Based on these teachings, one skilled in the art will appreciate that mutagenesis screen can be performed in other strains of Aspergillus.",
                                "The Aspergillus niger strain ATCC 11414 (WT) was engineered to produce a beta-glucosidase (BG) from the bacterium Thermobaculum terrenum, generating the strain J03. This enzyme was previously identified in a screen for thermophilic cellulose-degrading enzymes capable of functioning in the presence of the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3 methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) (Gladden et al. 2014). The fungal expression construct was designed using enzyme sequence codon-optimized to the genome of A. niger, driven by the A. niger glucoamylase promoter (PglaA) (SEQ ID NO: 8), and followed by a terminator from one of the Aspergillus nidulans tryptophan biosynthetic pathway genes (TtrpC) (Campen et al.). The A. niger J03 strain generated BG activity at moderately elevated levels compared to the parent (FIG. 1A) without significant change in the overall amount of protein secreted (FIG. 1B). It was possible to distinguish the activities of any native A. niger BG present in the culture supernatant samples from the heterologous bacterial enzyme through the inclusion of IL in the enzymatic assays: while the BG activity of both WT and GFP control strain are reduced to background levels in the presence of IL, the BG activity of the J03 strain is unaffected (FIG. 2C). A forward mutagenesis screen was designed using the J03 strain to identify loci that could enhance heterologous protein production.",
                                "Before carrying out the mutagenesis, a plate-based means of detecting secreted BG production was developed. First, a panel of colorimetric and fluorescent substrates was tested, including 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (X-Glc), esculin in combination with ferric citrate, indoxyl \u03b2-D-glucoside, 4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (MUGlc), and resorufin \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside. Culture supernatant from either J03 or the GFP control strain was spotted onto minimal media plates with these substrates infused into the agar: all but the indoxyl \u03b2-D-glucoside was found to allow for halo formation. However, when conidial spores from the same two strains were spread on the plates, only those containing X-Glc or esculin produced halos around the resulting colonies. Next, a solid medium containing high levels of peptone and maltose was found that produced the desired expression of recombinant BG from J03 while repressing the native BG secretion in the WT parent and GFP control strains. Finally, three colony-restricting compounds were tested: the detergent Triton X-100, the IL [C2mim][OAc], and ox-bile. Triton X-100 was effective in reducing colony size, but not at allowing for distinction between positive and negative (J03 and GFP, respectively) control strains while [C2mim][OAc] did not sufficiently restrict colony size, though it was effective at reducing native BG activity. Ox-bile (1% w/v) was chosen for the mutagenesis screen as it was most effective at limiting colony size while still allowing for clear BG halo formation.",
                                "Once a means of screening for BG hyper-secretors was optimized, conidia from the J03 strain were mutagenized using 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) to introduce point mutations in the genome and then spread onto plates with esculin, maltose, and ox-bile as detailed in Example 1. The spores were screened for large halo formation around colonies and stocks were made of those colonies with dark halo diameters exceeding that of the J03 parent strain. These strains were subsequently tested for BG activity by growing the strain in first small (5 mL) and then large (50 mL) liquid cultures and testing the supernatant using the substrate p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucopyranoside (pNPG) to confirm the BG hyper-secretion phenotype.",
                                "Mutagenesis of conidia from J03 generated 12 mutant strains with consistently increased BG activity relative to the parent strain. These strains were categorized according to their ability to generate native and/or heterologous BG (Table 3). J03-derivative strains that maintained increased BG activity in the presence of 10% (v/v) [C2mim][OAc] were categorized as strains over-producing the heterologous J03 BG (HET) whereas native BG hyper-production mutants showed no IL-tolerance (NAT). Of the twelve mutants, ten had increased J03 enzyme activity while two were native BG hyperproducers (strains J03 4.3 and J03 6.3). Of note were those strains that showed reductions of up to -50% BG activity in the presence of IL but did not reduce the activity to background as seen with the NAT strains. These strains\u2014J03 1.2, J03 2.8, J03 7.4, and J03 8.3\u2014were categorized as containing both elevated native and heterologous BG production (BOTH) relative to the parent.

Genomic DNA was sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and subsequently analyzed for mutations. Bcftools called 1,727 variants and GATK called 1,844 variants across all strains, and 1,694 and 1,326 variants passed fixed threshold filters, respectively. Among these, 962 variants called by both Bcftools and GATK were retained and subjected to annotation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertion/deletion (indel) calls were annotated using the filtered gene models of A. niger strain ATCC 1015 v4.0 (Aspni7 from the JGI). Variants in the coding regions, 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, and splice sites (overlapping the first or last two nucleotides of an intron) were annotated first, followed by variants in the promoter region (500 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream of the transcription start site). Larger structural variants were visually inspected and manually annotated. Synonymous mutations in the coding region and variants present in the J03 parent strain were excluded from further analysis. The results of this analysis are presented in FIG. 3.",

The one HET hyper-producer strains that does not have a mutation in mstC, J03 1.10, has a mutation in the promoter region of Transcript ID 1167209, a predicted amino acid transporter; this same promoter region was found to have a different mutation in one of the BOTH strains, J03 1.2.",

Based on these teachings, one skilled in the art will appreciate that mstC can be similarly deleted in other strains of Aspergillus.",
                                "To establish an association between the identified loci and hyper-production of heterologous enzyme, deletion of the mstC locus was pursued. Initially, the mstC locus was targeted for deletion in the same J03 background that the mutagenesis screen had been performed in. As shown in FIG. 4A, analysis of the BG activity of a J03 \u0394mstC strain found elevated levels of BG compared to the parental J03 strain and that this activity persisted in the presence of IL, indicating it was the heterologous J03 protein, as opposed to any native enzyme that was responsible for the increase in activity. As shown in FIG. 5, proteins found in the culture supernatants of both wild-type mstC and \u0394mstC strains yielded a similar banding pattern when examined by SDS-PAGE though the bands are more intense in the J03 \u0394mstC strain, reflective of the total secreted protein levels for these samples (FIG. 4B).",
                                "Next, it was determined whether the increased enzyme production in the absence of mstC was specific to the heterologous expression construct present in the original J03 strain. For this, strains in which the native glaA locus had been replaced by a bacterial BG from Thermotoga petrophila, A5 (Park et al. 2012), under control of one of several different promoters were utilized: \u0394glaA/PglaA-A5, \u0394glaA/PgpdA-A5, and \u0394glaA/Pecm33-A5 (see Example 1 for description of assembly). These strains differ from the J03 \u0394mstC strain in four respects: (1) expression of a distinct heterologous enzyme; (2) targeted as opposed to random integration of the expression construct; (3) deletion of the native glaA locus; and (4) use of additional constitutive promoters (PgpdA and Pecm33) were tested. As shown in FIG. 6A, the three different promoters allow for a small range of A5-associated BG activity (\u0394glaA/PglaA-A5>\u0394glaA/PgpdA-A5>\u0394glaA/Pecm33-A5). Deletion of the native mstC locus in these backgrounds resulted in an at least four-fold increase in heterologous BG activity in the \u0394glaA/PglaA-A5 strain but negligible differences in the \u0394glaA/PgpdA-A5 and \u0394glaA/Pecm33-A5 backgrounds. Interestingly, both the \u0394glaA/PgpdA-A5 \u0394mstC and \u0394glaA/Pecm33-A5 \u0394mstC strains show significantly increased total protein section compared to \u0394glaA/PglaA-A5 \u0394mstC (see FIG. 6B and FIG. 7) even though any change in A5 expression compared to the parent strain is minimal. Although the impact of \u0394mstC on protein production is apparently restricted to those heterologous loci placed behind the glaA promoter, it does not seem to be limited to a particular protein sequence as both the J03 and A5 enzyme activities could be elevated.",

As shown in FIG. 8A, analysis of the BG activity of a Pgla-A5 \u0394mstC strain found elevated levels of BG compared to the Pgla-A5 strain and that this activity persisted in the presence of IL, indicating it was the heterologous J03 protein as opposed to any native enzyme that was responsible for the increase in activity.
