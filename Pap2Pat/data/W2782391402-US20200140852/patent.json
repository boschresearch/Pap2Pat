                        "Naturally-occurring (standard) amino acids (SAAs) are the 20 unique building blocks composing all proteins derived from biological systems. Non-standard amino acids (NSAAs) have been developed bearing functional groups beyond those encoded by the 20 standard amino acids. To date, more than 70 non-standard amino acids (NSAAs) have been developed for in vivo protein translation. See Liu et al., Annual Review of Biochemistry 79:413-444 (2010). Methods of incorporating NSAAs into proteins using engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetases and transfer RNAs also inadvertently incorporate standard amino acids and non-target NSAAs due to promiscuity or nonspecificity of the engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetases and transfer RNAs corresponding to the NSAAs. Recently, in vivo Escherichia coli orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) having engineered tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs that reassign the amber stop codon (UAG) were developed to characterize the performance of these orthogonal translation systems (OTSs) with respect to the efficiency and accuracy of NSAA incorporation. It was shown that in vivo incorporation of amino acids into reporter proteins (and thus reporter synthesis) at reassigned amber codons may not discriminate between standard and non-standard amino acids. See Monk J W, et al. (2016) Rapid and Inexpensive Evaluation of Nonstandard Amino Acid Incorporation in Escherichia coli. ACS Synthetic Biology. One method of determining the fidelity of NSAA incorporation includes in vitro protein purification followed by low-throughput mass spectrometry. Such an approach confirms the promiscuity of at least one E. coli OTS system (Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (MjTyrRS)-derived orthogonal synthetases). See Young T S, Ahmad I, Yin J A, & Schultz P G (2010) An Enhanced System for Unnatural Amino Acid Mutagenesis in E. coli. Journal of Molecular Biology 395(2):361-374. Misincorporation of a standard amino acid for a nonstandard amino acid may be detrimental in the production of antibodies containing NSAAs for conjugation or the production of biomaterials containing NSAAs for tunable properties. The incorporation of SAAs instead of NSAAs represents the formation of impurities and the heterogeneous mixture lowers yields. Improvements in synthetase and tRNA specificity or selectivity can improve rate of NSAA incorporation. However, analyzing the polypeptide for rate of NSAA incorporation is laborious making modification of the synthetase or tRNA in response to experimental results a slow process. See Santoro S W, Wang L, Herberich B, King D S, & Schultz P G (2002) An efficient system for the evolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase specificity. Nat Biotech 20(10):1044-1048; and Amiram M. et al.

                        "The present disclosure provides a method for selectively degrading proteins having a standard amino acid at an amino acid target location within a mixture or collection or population of proteins including proteins having a nonstandard amino acid at the amino acid target location. In this context, the standard amino acid may be considered an undesired amino acid. The present disclosure also provides a method for selectively degrading proteins having an undesired non-target NSAA at an amino acid target location within a mixture or collection or population of proteins including proteins having a desired nonstandard amino acid at the amino acid target location. In this context, the undesired non-target NSAA may be considered an undesired amino acid. Aspects of the disclosure utilize methods and materials described herein to distinguish between different NSAAs at an amino acid target location when more than one NSAA is used during the synthesis procedure, such as when multiple different NSAAs are used simultaneously in vivo. According to one aspect, an in vivo methods are provided that can discriminate between NSAAs competing for incorporation at the same site of a protein.",
                        "According to one aspect, the methods may be carried out in vivo, i.e. within a cell. According to one aspect, methods of making target polypeptides having a non-standard amino acid substitution at an amino acid target location and methods of degrading target polypeptides having a standard amino acid substitution or an undesired NSAA (either referred to as an undesired amino acid) at the amino acid target location may be carried out in vivo, i.e. within a cell. According to one aspect, a target polypeptide is made which includes a non-standard amino acid at an amino acid target location using an engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and a transfer RNA corresponding to the non-standard amino acid. A removable protecting group is attached to the target polypeptide adjacent to the amino acid target location, such that when the removable protecting group is removed, an N-end amino acid is exposed at the amino acid target location. Should the engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and a transfer RNA add an undesired amino acid, i.e., a standard amino acid or an undesired NSAA, instead of the desired non-standard amino acid at the amino acid target location, methods are provided herein for degrading the target polypeptide including the undesired amino acid, i.e. a standard amino acid or an undesired NSAA, at the amino acid target location, such as by using the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation. According to one aspect, post-translational proofreading is used to distinguish correctly translated from incorrectly translated proteins. The disclosure provides a post-translational proofreading concept that results in protein degradation in a cell using the N-end rule unless the desired NSAA is incorporated at the N-terminus of the protein.",
                        "According to one aspect, the target polypeptide is made within a cell, i.e. in vivo, and the cell produces a protease and may also produce an adapter protein for the protease. i.e. a degradation system. Certain cells, such as E. coli, naturally produce the protease system ClpAP and the adaptor ClpS, and both components are present in order for the N-end rule degradation pathway to function. According to certain aspects, adaptor variants such as ClpS variants may be used which have different specificities than the natural ClpS. In this context, cell production of the natural ClpS be inactivated, for example, such as by gene modification where the ClpS gene sequence in the genome is modified to introduce premature stop codons. Such degradation systems are representative of a cellular system that degrades proteins according to the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation as is known in the art. According to the N-end rule, the half-life of a protein is determined by its N-terminal residue. An N-terminal residue is said to be destabilizing if it is recognized by a cellular degradation system, which in turn leads to degradation of the protein. If the N-terminal residue is not destabilizing, i.e, it is not recognized by a cellular degradation system, then the protein is not subject to the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation. Destabilizing amino acids may be natural amino acids. Destabilizing amino acids may be certain NSAAs. Destabilizing amino acids may be referred to as undesired amino acids. Stabilizing amino acids may be referred to as desired amino acids. Non-standard amino acids, such as analogs to natural amino acids, may be stabilizing or destabilizing amino acids. Certain non-standard amino acids, such as analogs to natural amino acids, may be resistant to degradation by cellular systems. In this manner, the method increases production (yield) of proteins having a desired amino acid, i.e., a stabilizing amino acid or an amino acid which is not destabilizing, such as certain non-standard amino acids, insofar as such a protein may not be subject to the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation. In this manner, the method decreases production (yield) of proteins having an undesired amino acid, such as a standard amino acid or a certain NSAA, insofar as such a protein may be subject to the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation. In this manner, the method determines successful desired NSAA incorporation to the extent that target polypeptides that include an undesired amino acid, such as a standard amino acid or a certain destabilizing NSAA (undesired NSAA), at the amino acid target location may be degraded and target polypeptides that include a desired non-standard amino acid at the amino acid target location remain and may not be degraded.",
                        "The present disclosure provides a method of optimizing production of proteins including a non-standard amino acid. Reaction conditions are provided for making a target polypeptide including a non-standard amino acid substitution at an amino acid target location using an engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and a transfer RNA as is known in the art. A removable protecting group is attached to the target polypeptide adjacent to the amino acid target location, such that when the removable protecting group is removed, an N-end amino acid is exposed at the amino acid target location. Should the engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and a transfer RNA add a standard amino acid or undesired NSAA instead of the desired non-standard amino acid at the amino acid target location, methods are provided herein for degrading the target polypeptide including the standard amino acid or undesired NSAA at the amino acid target location. The amount of proteins having a desired non-standard amino acid is determined. Given the amount of protein produced, the reaction conditions and/or the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and/or tRNA are altered and the amount of proteins having the desired non-standard amino acid is again determined. The process is repeated until the process is optimized for a desired yield of protein including desired NSAA. Exemplary reaction conditions which may be altered according to the present disclosure include changes of culture media or concentration of desired NSAA. Alterations or changes to the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and/or tRNA include one or more mutations that may improve performance of the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and/or tRNA. Such mutations may be made by methods known to those of skill in the art such as random mutagenesis approaches such as error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or directed approaches such as site-saturation mutagenesis or rational point mutagenesis.",

                        "The present disclosure provides a method of making a target protein using an amino-acyl tRNA synthetase engineered or designed to incorporate a target nonstandard amino acid (i.e., a desired NSAA) in the target protein at an amino acid target location, wherein a removable protecting group is adjacent the amino acid target location. The removable protecting group is removed to expose the amino acid target location in the presence of a degradation enzyme or degradation enzyme/adaptor complex. According to certain aspects, the adaptor discriminates between amino acids and accordingly whether degradation will occur by the degradation enzyme. According to one aspect, the degradation enzyme/adaptor complex degrades the target protein if a standard amino acid or undesired NSAA is present at the amino acid target location. If the desired nonstandard amino acid is present at the amino acid target location, then the degradation enzyme/adaptor complex is ineffective to degrade the target protein."

As used herein, the terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d include compounds that include amino acids joined together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acid residues. Exemplary cells include prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Exemplary prokaryotic cells include bacteria, such as E. coli, such as genetically modified E. coli. The method includes genetically modifying the cell to express the target polypeptide including a desired non-standard amino acid substitution at an amino acid target location using an engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and transfer RNA pair corresponding to the non-standard amino acid, and wherein the cell expresses the target polypeptide including a standard amino acid or an undesired NSAA at the amino acid target location when the engineered amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and transfer RNA pair non-selectively adds the standard amino acid or undesired NSAA at the amino acid target location. A removable protecting group is attached to the target polypeptide adjacent to the amino acid target location, such that when the removable protecting group is removed, an N-end amino acid is exposed at the amino acid target location. According to one aspect, the removable protecting group is orthogonal within the cell in which it is being used.",
                        "According to certain aspects, the cell includes a protease system for degrading the target polypeptide when the N-end amino acid is a standard amino acid. According to certain aspects, the cell includes a protease system for degrading the target polypeptide when the N-end amino acid is an undesired NSAA. According to certain aspects, the protease system includes an adapter protein and a corresponding protease. The adapter protein coordinates with the protease for degrading the target polypeptide when the N-end amino acid is a standard amino acid. According to one aspect, the protease system is endogenous. According to one aspect, the protease and adaptor can be expressed constitutively. According to one aspect, the protease system is exogenous. According to one aspect, the protease system is under influence of a promoter. According to one aspect, the adapter protein of the protease system is under influence of an inducible promoter. According to one aspect, the adapter protein is upregulated. According to one aspect, overexpression of adaptor to produce adaptor levels in excess of that found normally within a cell improves degradation of polypeptides having an undesired amino acid at the amino acid target location. According to one aspect, an adaptor protein is provided that facilitates N-end rule classification of an NSAA.",
                        "Because the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation is conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes, methods described herein are useful in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The removable protecting groups should be orthogonal in the cell within which it is being used. Ubiquitin is a suitable protecting group in prokaryotic cells because it is orthogonal but it is not a suitable protecting group in eukaryotic cells because it is not orthogonal. In eukaryotic cells, ubiquitin is N-terminally added to proteins often to initiate the process of protein degradation in the proteasome. In addition, the adaptor proteins in eukaryotic cells are homologs of ClpS known as Ubiquitin E3 ligases. According to the present disclosure, ubiquitin E3 ligase domain is altered in order to change the N-end rule classification of an NSAA.",

In this manner, the target polypeptide including a desired non-standard amino acid substitution, i.e. which is resistant to degradation, is enriched within the cell. According to one aspect, embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods that allow selective degradation of proteins having a standard amino acid or undesired NSAA instead of a desired nonstandard amino acid at their N-termini in a cell. The methods can be used for producing proteins with desired nonstandard amino acids at their N-termini with no detectable impurities.",

According to this aspect, the target polypeptide includes a detectable moiety attached to the C-end of the target polypeptide. In this manner, if the target polypeptide (and detectable moiety) that is made by the cell is not subject to degradation as described above, then the detectable moiety is detected as a measure of the amount of target polypeptide generated by the cell. Accordingly, a method is provided where a detectable moiety is present at the C-end of the target polypeptide, the removable protecting group is removed to generate an N-end amino acid, the protease (whether accompanied by an adapter protein or not depending upon the protease system being used) degrades the target polypeptide when the N-end amino acid is a standard amino acid or an undesired NSAA, for example, to thereby enrich the target polypeptide including a desired non-standard amino acid substitution, and the detectable moiety is detected as a measure of the amount of the target polypeptide including a desired non-standard amino acid substitution.",
                        "According to one aspect, a method is provided for engineering synthetases that are more selective for incorporating non-standard amino acids versus standard amino acids at a selected site in a protein. Since all or substantially all of proteins bearing a standard amino acid or an undesired NSAA at their N-terminus are degraded leaving only proteins with a desired nonstandard amino at their N-terminus, no or substantially no background signal due to standard amino acid or undesired NSAA incorporation results from the method. Synthetases can be evolved and their variants screened in a high-throughput fashion for their function of producing a protein incorporating a nonstandard amino acid, such as a desired NSAA. In this manner, those synthetases with improved function can be identified and modified further to further improve efficiency and selectivity.",

In general, a cell is genetically modified to include a nucleic acid sequence which encodes for the target polypeptide that includes one or more non-standard amino acids within its amino acid sequence. The cell can be genomically recoded, (\u201ca genomically recoded organsim\u201d) to the extent that one or more codons have been reassigned to encode for a non-standard amino acid. For each different non-standard amino acid, an amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair is engineered and the cell is capable of using the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair to add the corresponding non-standard amino acid (when present in the cell) to a growing peptide sequence. Materials, conditions, and reagents for genetically modifying a cell to make a target protein having one or more amino acid sequences are described in the following references, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.",
                        "Approaches to genomically recode organisms include multiplex automatable genome engineering (MAGE). (for example, as described in Wang, Harris H., et al. \u201cProgramming cells by multiplex genome engineering and accelerated evolution.\u201d Nature 460.7257 (2009): 894-898 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) and hierarchical conjugative assembly genome engineering (CAGE) (for example, as described in Isaacs, Farren J., et al. \u201cPrecise manipulation of chromosomes in vivo enables genome-wide codon replacement.\u201d Science 333.6040 (2011): 348-353 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In addition, portions of recoded genomes can be synthesized and subsequently assembled, as described recently in an effort to construct a 57-codon organism (for example, as described in Ostrov, Nili, et al. \u201cDesign, synthesis, and testing toward a 57-codon genome.\u201d Science 353.6301 (2016): 819-822 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The modification of an organism, whether recoded or not recoded, in order to express a polypeptide containing a site-specific non-standard amino acid has been described extensively in the literature (for example, as described in Wang, Lei, et al. \u201cExpanding the genetic code of Escherichia coli.\u201d Science 292.5516 (2001): 498-500; Chin. Jason W., et al. \u201cAn expanded eukaryotic genetic code.\u201d Science 301.5635 (2003): 964-967; Wang. Lei, and Peter G.

Jason W. \u201cExpanding and reprogramming the genetic code of cells and animals.\u201d Annual review of biochemistry 83 (2014): 379-408 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In brief, foreign nucleic acid sequences containing a gene encoding an orthogonal amino-acyl tRNA synthetase and an associated tRNA are introduced into an organism, typically in an expression vector. In addition, a desired non-standard amino acid is added to the cell culture medium. A nucleic acid sequence corresponding to a target protein is modified so that a free codon, such as the UAG codon, is formed at the target site of the gene encoding the target protein. In the presence of these four components\u2014aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein, tRNA, NSAA, and target protein mRNA\u2014the target protein containing the NSAA is made.",
                        "Basic to the present disclosure is the use of an amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair cognate to a nonstandard amino acid. Exemplary amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs cognate to a nonstandard amino acid are known to those of skill in the art or may be designed for particular non-standard amino acids, as is known in the art or as described in Wang, Lei, and Peter G.

                        "According to one aspect, the amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair cognate to a nonstandard amino acid is orthogonal to the cellular components of the cell in which it is used. The orthogonality (and therefore the suitability) of exogenous amino-acyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs is dependent on the type of host organism. Four main orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been developed for genetic code expansion: the Methanococcus janaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (MjTyrRS)/tRNACUA pair, the Escherichia coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (EcTyrRS)/tRNACUA pair, the E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS)/tRNACUA pair, and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNACUA pairs from certain Methanosarcina. The MjTyrRS/tRNACUA pair is orthogonal in E. coli but not in eukaryotic cells. The EcTyrRS/tRNACUA pair and the EcLeuRS/tRNACUA pair are orthogonal in eukaryotic cells but not in E. coli, whereas the PylRS/tRNACUA pair is orthogonal in bacteria, eukaryotic cells, and animals (see Chin, Jason W. \u201cExpanding and reprogramming the genetic code of cells and animals.\u201d Annual review of biochemistry 83 (2014): 379-408 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). To maintain orthogonality, the exogenous amino acyl tRNA synthetase should not recognize any native amino acids or native tRNA. To maintain orthogonality, the tRNA should not be recognized by any native amino-acyl tRNA synthetases. To maintain orthogonality, the non-standard amino acid should not be recognized by any native amino acyl tRNA synthetases. \u201cOrthogonal\u201d pairs meet one or more of the above conditions. It is to be understood that \u201corthogonal\u201d pairs may lead to some mischarging. i.e. such as insubstantial mischarging for example, of orthogonal tRNA with native amino acids so long as sufficient efficiency of charging to the designed NSAA occurs.",

As is known in the art, the synthetase catalyzes a reaction that attaches the nonstandard amino acid to the correct tRNA. The amino-acyl tRNA then migrates to the ribosome. The ribosome adds the nonstandard amino acid where the tRNA anticodon corresponds to the reverse complement of the codon on the mRNA of the target protein to be translated."

An exemplary removable protecting protein domain includes a self-splicing domain, such as an intein, or other cleavable domains such as small ubiquitin modifiers (SUMO proteins). An exemplary removable protecting group may be a protein cleavage sequence along with its cognate partner, such as the TEV cleavage site and TEV protease. In general, any of the strategies used to remove N-terminal affinity tags in protein purification can serve as alternative ways to expose the N-end target residue. An exemplary system to expose the N-end target residue includes a class of enzymes known as methionine aminopeptidases which can remove the first N-terminal residue, such as when the second residue is the amino acid target location which is the desired site of addition of a NSAA. According to one aspect, the amino acid target location may be the N-terminal location or it may be any location between the N-terminal location and the C-terminal location. Accordingly, methods are provided for removing a protecting group and/or all amino acids up to the amino acid target location, thereby rendering the amino acid target location being the N-terminal amino acid."

Such regulatory elements are described, for example, in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Regulatory elements include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences). Regulatory elements useful in eukaryotic cells include a tissue-specific promoter that may direct expression primarily in a desired tissue of interest, such as muscle, neuron, bone, skin, blood, specific organs (e.g. liver, pancreas), or particular cell types (e.g. lymphocytes).

A terminator sequence includes a section of nucleic acid sequence that marks the end of a gene or operon in genomic DNA during transcription. This sequence mediates transcriptional termination by providing signals in the newly synthesized mRNA that trigger processes which release the mRNA from the transcriptional complex. These processes include the direct interaction of the mRNA secondary structure with the complex and/or the indirect activities of recruited termination factors. Release of the transcriptional complex frees RNA polymerase and related transcriptional machinery to begin transcription of new mRNAs. Terminator sequences include those known in the art and identified and described herein."

                                "As used herein, the term \u201cSAA\u201d (standard amino acid) include one of the L-amino acids that typically naturally occur in proteins on Earth and includes alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, tryptophan, proline and valine. The standard amino acids that are naturally N-end destabilizing in most bacteria include tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, leucine, lysine, and arginine. According to one aspect, the amino acid at the amino acid target location is an NSAA that is stabilizing. When the natural analog of the NSAA is destabilizing and is present at the amino acid target location, degradation of the polypeptide occurs. Standard amino acids that are not naturally destabilizing via the N-end rule using natural ClpS, can be destabilizing when the ClpS is engineered to recognize such standard amino acid.",
                                "The N-end rule in bacteria may also be engineered to recognize isoleucine, valine, aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, and glutamine as destabilizing using methods known to those of skill in the art which is useful when the desired NSAA is an analog of these amino acids. For example, isoleucine and valine can be converted into N-end destabilizing residues by introducing a ClpS variant (M40A) that recognizes these amino acids as N-terminal destabilizing residues see (Rom\u00e1n-Hern\u00e1ndez G, Grant R A. Sauer R T, & Baker T A (2009) Molecular basis of substrate selection by the N-end rule adaptor protein ClpS. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106(22):8888-8893 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). In fact, we observe that by merely overexpressing ClpS, isoleucine and valine appear as N-end destabilizing residues (FIG. 3F). Aspartate and glumatate may be converted into N-end destabilizing residues by introducing a bacterial aminoacyl-transferase from Vibrio vulnificus (Bpt) that is a homolog of eukaryotic transferases and N-terminally appends a leucine (L) to peptides containing N-terminally exposed aspartate or glutamate (see Graciet E, et al. (2006) Aminoacyl-transferases and the N-end rule pathway of prokaryotic/eukaryotic specificity in a human pathogen. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 103(9):3078-3083 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The ability of Bpt to catalyze this reaction has been demonstrated in E. coli and shows that components of the N-end rule, which includes many more conditionally destabilizing residues in eukaryotes, can be transferred across kingdoms. Asparagine and glutamine can be converted into N-end destabilizing residues by using an N-terminal amidase from S. cerevisiae (NTA 1), which converts N-terminal asparagine into aspartate or N-terminal glutamine into glumate, respectively (see Tasaki T. Sriram S M, Park K S, & Kwon Y T (2012) The N-End Rule Pathway. Annual Review of Biochemistry 81(1):261-289 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Indeed, in many eukaryotic cells these amino acids and more are naturally conditionally N-end destabilizing. One of skill will understand that an N-end rule destabilizing pathway may be provided for all 20 standard amino acids as a basis for a system where a desired amino acid from among the 20 standard amino acids is N-end destabilizing in at least one context (see Chen, Shun-Jia, et al. \u201cAn N-end rule pathway that recognizes proline and destroys gluconeogenic enzymes.\u201d Science 355.6323 (2017): eaal3655 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). One of skill in the art can identify the eukaryotic proteins required for conferring expanded N-end destabilization and transfer them to prokaryotes as needed. Similarly, in eukaryotic cells one can constitutively express components required for conferring expanded N-end destabilization such that degradation of proteins containing N-end standard amino acids no longer remains conditional. One of skill will recognize that some amino acids rendered destabilizing may have adverse consequences for cell physiology. For example, most native proteins begin with methionine and if methionine is made N-end destabilizing then most proteins would degrade. Aspects of converting an N-end stabilizing amino acid to an N-end destabilizing amino acid can be tested in a particular organism."

                                "Advancements to genetic code expansion require accurate, selective, and high-throughput determination of non-standard amino acid (NSAA) incorporation into proteins. This example sets forth embodiments for engineering synthetic quality control for detection of NSAA incorporation with minimal incidence of false positives due to common misincorporation of related standard amino acids or undesired NSAAs. Post-Translational Proofreading (PTP) was achieved by targeting desired NSAAs for incorporation at a site subsequently exposed as the N-terminus of a reporter protein, which is stabilized by correct incorporation or destabilized by misincorporation. It has been shown that PTP is modular, generalizable, and highly tunable by engineering the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation to discriminate incorporation of different NSAAs from one another. Embodiments in this example illustrate PTP utility during evolution of the biphenylalanine orthogonal translation system (OTS) used for biocontainment. The more selective OTS confers lower escape frequencies and greater fitness to all three tested strains. This work presents a new paradigm for molecular recognition of competitive amino acids in target proteins.",
                                "The fidelity of translation relies on the selectivity of amino acyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases (AARSs), which catalyze esterification of tRNAs to their corresponding amino acids (1). Orthogonal AARS/tRNA pairs, together known as OTSs, enable site-specific NSAA incorporation into proteins, most often by suppressing amber (UAG) stop codons in targeted sequences (2, 3). Four primary site-specific OTS families have been developed for NSAA incorporation: Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (MjTyrRS)/tRNACUATyr: various Methanosarcina pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNACUAPyl; Escherichia coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (EcTyrRS)/tRNACUATyr; and E. coli leucyl-tRNA synthetase (EcLeuRS)/tRNACUALeu (4, 5). Another commonly used OTS is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (ScTrpRS)/tRNACUATrp pair (6-8) (FIG. 1A).",
                                "However, engineered OTS promiscuity for standard amino acids (SAAs) and for undesired NSAAs is a major barrier to expansion of the genetic code. The low fidelity of several OTSs is documented, revealing that even after multiple rounds of negative selection they misacylate tRNA with SAAs that their ancestral variants acted upon, such as tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W) (9-13). The problem of OTS cross-talk with SAAs is exemplified in the case of biocontainment, which was previously demonstrated based on the NSAA biphenylalanine (BipA) and its corresponding OTS (14) (FIG. 1B). Protease mutations were found in sequenced escapees that emerged in the absence of BipA, suggesting that redesigned enzymes intended to be destabilized by SAA misincorporation may transiently remain functional prior to degradation (15). Furthermore, genomic integration of the BipA OTS, which likely decreased misincorporation, reduced escape frequency. Given that OTS evolution efforts have not selected against activity upon undesired NSAAs, greater promiscuity is expected in the presence of multiple NSAAs. OTS promiscuity is of particular concern when using members of TyrRS/TrpRS/PylRS families together given demonstrated overlap of substrate ranges (16-18). Together, these concerns converge as we progress towards constructing a 57-codon E. coli strain anticipated to exhibit multi-virus resistance, to require biocontainment, and to serve as a platform for producing proteins containing multiple different NSAAs (19). Many other applications utilizing NSAAs, such as protein double labelling, FRET, and antibody conjugation, also require high fidelity incorporation to avoid heterogenous protein production.",
                                "Currently, the identity of incorporated amino acid can only be determined in low-throughput via protein purification and mass spectrometry. This approach was used initially to determine the identity of SAAs incorporated by the BipA OTS in the absence of BipA (90%+Y/L/F observed, with Q also present due to known OTS-independent near-cognate suppression (20, 21)) (FIG. 1C). SAA spiking experiments were also performed in minimal media and found that these too suggested Y and L incorporation (FIG. 4). To dramatically accelerate OTS engineering efforts, a system was sought to be developed with the following design criteria: (i) the ability to controllably mask and unmask misincorporation for a single reporter in vivo; (ii) compatibility with different reporter proteins; (iii) customizability for most commonly used NSAAs. Embodiments of the disclosure relates to the development of \u201cPost-Translational Proofreading\u201d (PTP) to discriminate NSAA incorporation in vivo. The N-end rule of protein degradation, a natural protein regulatory and quality control pathway conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes (22-24), was repurposed and altered for synthetic substrates. In E. coli, N-end destabilizing residues (Y/F/W/UK/R) result in protein half-lives on the timescale of minutes (23). It was observed that all SAAs corresponding to commonly used NSAAs are reportedly N-end destabilizing. The ability to optionally degrade proteins containing misincorporation events is expected to dramatically facilitate OTS directed evolution because positive screens with degradation can lower incidence of false positive misincorporation events and negative screens without degradation can screen against unmasked misincorporation.",
                                "To begin, a reporter consisting of a cleavable ubiquitin domain (Ub) followed by one UAG codon, a conditionally strong N-degron (25, 26), and a super-folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) with a C-terminal His6\u00d7-tag was genomically integrated into a recoded E. coli strain devoid of UAG codons and associated release factor (C321.\u0394A) (27), resulting in strain C321.Ub-UAG-sfGFP (FIG. 1D). The use of only one UAG codon increases assay sensitivity for promiscuity compared to the use of multi-UAG codon reporters (28), and genomic integration of the reporter increases reproducibility by eliminating plasmid copy number effects (29). Plasmids were used to express different combinations of the orthogonal tRNACUATyr, the BipARS, and an N-terminally truncated yeast Ub cleavase protein (UBP1) (30, 31). Overexpression of N-end rule pathway components already present in C321.\u0394A: clpS and clpP were also tested. ClpS is the adaptor protein that binds peptides containing primary N-end substrates (Y/F/W/L) and delivers them to the ClpAP AAA+ protease complex for unfolding and degradation (32).",
                                "In vivo GFP fluorescence normalized to optical density (FL/OD) was measured to approximate the amount of synthesized reporter protein containing NSAA per cell for these strains. Experiments with and without BipA (BipA+ or BipA\u2212) revealed that expression of the orthogonal tRNA alone was responsible for a moderate amount of FL/OD, but that together expression of the BipARS/tRNA pair resulted in BipA\u2212 FL/OD nearly as high as BipA+ FL/OD (FIGS. 1E-1F). Encouragingly, it was observed significant reduction of the BipA\u2212 FL/OD upon UBP1 expression, which is required for N-end exposure of the target residue. The decrease in only BipA\u2212 FL/OD supported our hypothesis that BipA would be N-end stabilizing. BipA\u2212 FL/OD further decreased upon overexpression of ClpS, suggesting that the rate of N-end discrimination was previously limiting.",
                                "Through the addition of another UAG codon internal to the GFP, it is verified that BipA incorporation at any position does not confer a stabilizing effect and that the N-end rule is behaving as expected upon substitution of the N-end UAG to UGG (serine, stabilizing) or UAC (tyrosine, destabilizing) (FIG. 5A). Additionally, it was demonstrated that the use of one N-terminal UAG in the reporter does not lead to significantly different results from the use of two UAGs (FIG. 5B). By replacing the sfGFP reporter with selectable markers that provide resistance to carbenicillin or chloramphenicol, it was verified that PTP can be easily extended to other target proteins (FIGS. 6A-6B).",
                                "It was next sought to characterize the promiscuity of the BipA OTS and several other MjTyrRS-derived OTSs for different NSAAs (FIG. 1B) and subsequently for SAAs. To examine OTS promiscuity for SAAs, the Ub-UAG-GFP reporter strain was used to implement an optional PTP \u201cOff\u201d or \u201cOn\u201d approach with co-expression of UBP1 and ClpS to provide insight about relative levels of SAA/NSAA incorporation in the absence or presence of NSAA (NSAA\u2212 or NSAA+) (FIG. 2A). The native ClpS and the ClpP protease were overexpressed to determine their effect on the kinetics of GFP reporter degradation. The abundance of the GFP was measured as green fluorescence normalized by optical density (FL/OD) using a standard plate reader for fluorimetric and spectrophotometric assays. Two different families of OTSs (MjTyrRS and ScTrpRS) without PTP were examined (FIG. 2B). Every OTS except for BipyARS/tRNACUATyr exhibited high NSAA\u2212 FL/OD. Confirming the generality of our PTP approach, significant decrease of NSAA\u2212 FL/OD for all OTSs with PTP \u201cOn\u201d was observed (FIG. 2C). However, significant decrease of NSAA+ FL/OD for two NSAAs: p-Azido-phenylalanine (pAzF) and 5-Hydroxy-tryptophan (5OHW) was also observed. Since ClpS is endogenous to E. coli, it need not be overexpressed. However, overexpression, such as by use of an inducible promoter, increases the concentration of ClpS and therefore the ability of ClpS to discriminate between desired nonstandard amino acids and undesired standard amino acids or undesired NSAAs.",
                                "It was next profiled incorporation of a more diverse set of NSAAs with PTP \u201cOff\u201d and \u201cOn\u201d to better understand their N-end classification for potential engineering (FIG. 3A). Based on the difference in FL/OD between \u201cOff\u201d and \u201cOn\u201d states using an OTS with limited activity on SAAs, we could learn whether an NSAA is N-end stabilizing or destabilizing. We began by using the BipyA OTS to screen several NSAAs because of its low NSAA\u2212 FL/OD. However, this OTS resulted in observable NSAA+ FL/OD for only 5 out of 11 tested phenyl-NSAAs, with preference for large hydrophobic side chains at the para position of phenylalanine.",
                                "Notably, NSAA+ FL/OD for these 5 NSAAs was unaffected by PTP. The pAcF OTS was used to test incorporation of the 6 remaining NSAAs and appeared to broadly increase FL/OD for all with PTP \u201cOff\u201d. We next observed a marked change in \u0394FL/OD between PTP \u201cOff\u201d and \u201cOn\u201d states based roughly on NSAA size. For p-Iodo-phenylalanine (pIF), FL/OD did not significantly change, and therefore pIF is N-end stabilizing. However, for p-Bromo-phenylalanine (pBrF) and other smaller or polar phenyl-NSAAs such as pAzF, FL/OD was significantly diminished when PTP was \u201cOn\u201d. The data suggest that smaller deviations from Y/F are tolerated by the ClpS binding pocket, making these NSAAs N-end destabilizing.",
                                "By examining the ClpS crystal structure, we hypothesized that we could engineer ClpS to alter N-end rule classification of these NSAAs. We targeted four hydrophobic residues in the ClpS binding pocket for single point mutagenesis covering F/L/I/V (FIG. 3B). Sequence alignments of ClpS homologs across prokaryotes and eukaryotes showed conservation of these residues among related hydrophobic amino acids (FIGS. 7A-7B). By screening the resulting 12 single mutants in a ClpS-deficient strain (C321.\u0394ClpS.Ub-UAG-sfGFP) with select NSAAs and the pAcF OTS, we identified a variant (ClpSV65I) that resulted in at least partial stabilization of all screened N-end phenyl NSAAs while maintaining low NSAA\u2212 FL/OD (FIG. 3C). In addition, we identified a variant (ClpSL32F) that resulted in complete degradation of all but the two largest screened N-end phenyl NSAAs (FIG. 8). This small rationally engineered library contained several variants with specificities for different sets of NSAAs, showcasing the remarkable tunability of PTP. We further asked whether library members could distinguish tryptophanyl analogs from tryptophan using the 5OHW OTS (FIG. 3D). Although 5OHW is N-end destabilizing with ClpS, we observed that ClpSV43I and ClpSV65I improved discrimination of 5OHW from W (FIG. 3E). This result confirmed that the 5OHW OTS could incorporate 5OHW and that the previously observed signal was not predominantly due to misincorporation of SAAs. Furthermore, our rational designs could distinguish small modifications on a variety of chemical templates. i.e. NSAAs with phenyl as well as indole sidechains. Given the desirable properties of ClpSV65I for our NSAAs of interest, we wanted to examine whether it alters N-end rule classification for SAAs. We substituted the UAG codon in our GFP reporter for codons encoding a representative panel of SAAs and found that ClpSV65I affects stability of these N-end SAAs no differently than ClpS (FIG. 3F). Interestingly, overexpression of either ClpS or ClpSV65I lead to degradation of N-end I/V. Though these are not normally classified as N-end destabilizing residues, no one has previously overexpressed ClpS in E. coli and it exhibits weak affinity for these substrates in vitro (33)."

The term \u201cV65I\u201d or \u201cV43I\u201d is a standard notation for describing a mutation where the amino acid I has been substituted for amino acid V at position 65 or 43. The ClpS_V65I and ClpS_V43I mutants were capable of distinguishing between standard amino acids and their nonstandard amino acid counterparts when positioned at the N-terminus of a protein for purposes of degradation. One aspect of the present disclosure is to inactivate endogenous ClpS if the ClpS_V65I or ClpS_V43I mutant is being used. Inactivation of ClpS prevents indiscriminate or nonselective degradation of proteins including smaller nonstandard amino acids. Another useful mutant is ClpS_L32F, which causes biphenylalanine (bipA) and p-benzoylphenylalanine (pBnzylF) to be N-end stabilizing and all other tested NSAAs to be N-end destabilizing. In other words, the ClpS_L32F mutant can be used to discriminate between incorporated bipA and all other incorporated NSAAs other than pBnzylF (see FIG. 8)."

If the standard amino acid corresponding to the sense codon is destabilizing by the N-end rule, all of the proteins which do not include a sense codon reassigned to a nonstandard amino acid will be degraded. As shown in FIG. 8 with respect to the UAC codon which normally encodes tyrosine, when expression of Ubp1/ClpS is induced, nearly all of the GFP containing tyrosine gets degraded.

This resulted in strain C321.Ub-UAG-sfGFP. Please see Table 1 for sequences of key constructs such as the reporter construct. Multiplex automatable genome engineering (MAGE) (48) was used to inactivate the endogenous mutS and clpS genes when needed and to add or remove UAG codons in the integrated reporter. For MAGE, saturated overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into 3 mL LBL containing appropriate antibiotics and grown at 34\u00b0 C. until mid-log. The integrated Lambda Red cassette in C321.\u0394A derived strains was induced in a shaking water bath (42\u00b0 C., 300 rpm, 15 minutes), followed by cooling culture tubes on ice for at least two minutes. These cells were made electrocompetent at 4\u00b0 C. by pelleting 1 mL of culture (16,000 ref, 20 seconds) and washing twice with 1 mL ice cold deionized water (dH2O). Electrocompetent pellets were resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of dH2O containing the desired DNA. For MAGE oligonucleotides, 5 \u03bcM of each oligonucleotide was used. Please see Table 2 for a list of all oligonucleotides used in this study. For integration of dsDNA cassettes, 50 ng was used. Allele-specific colony PCR (ASC-PCR) was used to identify desired colonies resulting from MAGE as previously described (49). Colony PCR was performed using Kapa 2G Fast HotStart ReadyMix according to manufacturer protocols and Sanger sequencing was performed by Genewiz to verify strain engineering.

AARSs used in this study were the following: BipARS (14), BipyARS (14), pAcFRS (38), pAzFRS (39), and NapARS (40). The pEVOL plasmids were maintained using chloramphenicol. Original plasmids harboring two AARS copies were used for synthetase promiscuity comparison experiments (FIGS. 2A-2C and 3A-3F). For generation and characterization of synthetase variants, plasmids harboring only one AARS copy under inducible expression were constructed using Gibson assembly (41). The ScWRS-R3-13 AARS was synthesized as codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and cloned into the pEVOL plasmid along with its associated tRNA (6, 8). In all cases, tRNA is constitutively expressed and AARS expression is either arabinose inducible or constitutive.",
                                "An N-terminally truncated form of the UBP1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30, 31) (ScUBP1trunc or simply UBP1) was synthesized as codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and cloned into the pZE21 vector (Kanamycin resistance, ColE1 origin, TET promoter) (Expressys). The E. coli genes clpS and clpP were PCR amplified from E. coli MG1655 and cloned into artificial operons downstream of the UBP1 gene in the pZE21 vector using Gibson assembly. Artificial operons were created by inserting the following RBS sequence between the UBP1 and clp genes: TAATAAAAGGAGATATACC. This RBS was originally designed using the RBS calculator (42) and previously validated in the context of another artificial operon (43). Rational engineering of ClpS variants was performed by dividing the clpS gene into two amplicons where the second amplicon contained a degenerate NTC or NTT sequence in the oligo corresponding to each codon of interest. The four initial positions of interest in the clpS gene correspond to amino acids 32, 43, 65, and 99. In each case. Gibson assembly was used to ligate both amplicons and the backbone plasmid. The pZE/UBP1/ClpS and pZE/UBP1/ClpS_V65I plasmids are available from Addgene.",

EP-PCR was performed using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Catalog #200550), following manufacturer instructions to obtain approximately an average of 2-4 DNA mutations per library member. To generate libraries of MjTyrRS-derived AARSs, roughly 175 ng of PCR template was used in each 25 uL of PCR mix containing primers that have roughly 40 base pairs of homology flanking the AARS coding region. The reaction mixture was subject to 30 cycles with Tm of 63\u00b0 C. and extension time of 1 min. Four separate 25 uL EP-PCR reactions were performed per AARS and then pooled. Plasmid backbone PCRs were performed using KOD Xtreme Hot Start Polymerase (Millipore Catalog #71795). Both PCR products were isolated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and Gibson assembled in 8 parallel 20 uL volumes per library. Assemblies were pooled, washed by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of dH2O, which was drop dialyzed (EMD Millipore, Billerica. Mass.) and electroporated into E. cloni supreme cells (Lucigen, Middleton, Wis.).

Prior to each round, the usual NSAA incorporation assay procedure was followed such that cells would express GFP reporter proportional to the activity of the AARS library member. One notable deviation from that procedure was the use of a higher and variable inoculum volume to screen the full library at each stage. Cells displaying the top 0.5% of fluorescence activation (50 k cells) were collected after Round 1, expanded overnight, and used to inoculate experimental cultures for the next round. Because the next round was a negative screening round, the desired NSAA was not added into culture medium. The rest of the NSAA incorporation assay procedure was followed in order to eliminate cells that remained fluorescence due to promiscuous AARS activity on standard amino acids. In the second sort, cells displaying the lowest 10% of visible fluorescence (500 k cells) were collected. Cells passing the second round were expanded overnight and used to inoculate the third and final round of sorting. The experimental cultures for the third round were treated as the first round and were sorted for the upper 0.05% of fluorescence activation (1 k cells). The final cells collected were expanded overnight and plated for sequencing and downstream testing. Libraries were frozen at each stage before and after sorting. FlowJo X software was used to analyze the flow cytometry data. Constructs of interest were grown overnight, miniprepped, and transformed into C321.\u0394A.Ubiq-UAG-sfGFP for further analysis in plate reader assays.",
