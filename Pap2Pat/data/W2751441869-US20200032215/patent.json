    "abstract": "The fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) has been recognized as a site of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). However, absence of relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture has hindered understanding of FTE transformation and initiation of HGSC. Here, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used to establish a novel 3-dimensional (3D) human FTE organoid in vitro model containing the relevant cell types of the human fallopian tube as well as a luminal architecture that closely reflects the organization of fallopian tissues in vivo. Modulation of Wnt and nodal/activin signaling pathways provided iPSC differentiation into M\u00fcllerian cells and subsequent use of pro-M\u00fcllerian growth factors promoted FTE precursors. The expression of M\u00fcllerian markers verified correct cellular differentiation. An innovative 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure, permitted final differentiation to a FTE lineage. This powerful human-derived FTE organoid model can be used to study the earliest stages of HGSC development and to identify novel and specific biomarkers of early fallopian tube epithelial cell transformation.",

                        "High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (\u02dc70%), has the highest mortality rate among all gynecological cancers. HGSC has a poor prognosis due to a combination of factors including late stage at diagnosis and a high predilection for developing drug resistance. It is now accepted that the majority of HGSCs arise from the secretory cells of the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE). The discovery of in situ lesions in the fallopian tube fimbriae, namely serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), supports the concept of the FTE origin of serous \u201covarian\u201d carcinoma. STICs are part of the high grade serous carcinogenic sequence and are believed to include early p53 mutations resulting in a \u201c53 signature\u201d that develops into invasive serous carcinoma of the fallopian tube, and that secondarily involves the nearby ovarian surface. The discovery of an extra-ovarian origin of ovarian cancer is a fundamental advance toward improving early detection, prevention and treatment of this lethal disease. However, the lack of relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture and study early alterations has hindered the further understanding of the mechanisms of FTE transformation as well as the initiation and progression of HGSC. Thus, there is a great need in the art for FTE cells, organoids and associated methods thereof.",
                        "Stem cell derived 3D organoid cancer models are emerging as powerful tools for understanding pathological processes at the molecular and cellular level, and they will be a critical platform to study the earliest stages of ovarian cancer development, which is poorly understood. By generating accurate organotypic human models of early-stage disease, the Inventors expect to be able to identify novel and specific biomarkers of early fallopian tube epithelial cell transformation. In the long term, this project could lead an identification of molecular targets for chemoprevention and thus significant reduction in the number of deaths from ovarian cancer each year.",
                        "Described herein is an iPSC-derived cellular model of fallopian tube epithelium development with numerous potential practical applications, including the identification of early biomarkers to stage disease progression and better classification of genetic risk factors. Methods and compositions for generating iPSC-derived FTE, including 3D organoids, offers a promising platform for validation of new drugs and targets, and modeling resistance to therapy within the tumor micro-environment in rapid, cost efficient manner. By generating iPSC-derived 3D FTE organoid model with various inherited mutant sample, one can elucidate specific mutant dependent response to treatment and can thereby predict the drug sensitivity of individual patients based on their unique spectrum of genetic mutations, allowing for guidance in treatment decisions and optimizing clinical outcomes in cancer patients."

                        "As described, it is now widely-understood that a majority of high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) arise from the secretory cells of the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE). What is needed to build upon these discoveries is relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture and study early alterations that lead to FTE transformation as well as the initiation and progression of HGSC.",
                        "Fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) is composed of a polarized columnar epithelium with multiple cell types including ciliated and secretory cells. Current fallopian tube models, including ex vivo and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models, demonstrate the importance of the polarity of cells in recreating secretory and ciliated cells. However, FTE cells in these models have a reduced proliferation rate due to induced senescence because of the lack of convoluted luminal architecture and the ectopic microenvironment. Mouse models, including patient-derived xenograft and genetically engineered mice, have overcome some of these limitations and yielded significant insights into the basis of cancer development. However, the complexity of a human tumor is not reliably represented in mouse models. Furthermore, it has been a challenge to engineer silent and expressed mutations with the correct expression timeframe as well as accurate targeting to specific tissue and cell types, such as the secretory cell of the fallopian tube. While biopsy derived 3D human fallaopian tube organoid models exists, such approaches are dependent on human biopsy and fallopian tissue with high-risk mutations including BRCA1 cannot be collected for research purposes.",
                        "Alternatively, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and 3D-tissue engineering provide powerful tools to recapitulate physiologically relevant aspects of disease progression in vitro and to enhance monolayer cell culture studies. Induced PSCs are generated by reprogramming somatic cells and can be subsequently differentiated into most any cell type. Recently, patient-derived iPSCs have been used to model several inherited human diseases and to successfully generate relevant cell types that displayed disease pathogenesis. However, remaining challenges with iPSC-based modeling include establishing direct differentiation protocols for desired cell types and integrating the cells into functional tissue structures.",
                        "Here, the Inventors describe a rapid and efficient method to create an iPSC-derived 3D model of human FTE with the desired cell types and luminal architecture. The female reproductive tract, including FTE, arises from the Mullerian duct in parallel to the urinary system from intermediate mesoderm (IM) of the urogenital ridge in the posterior primitive streak. As such, the Inventors have recapitulated Mullerian development in vitro by starting with established IM protocols and then pro-Mullerian growth factors were used to develop FTE precursors. Correct differentiation was monitored through the expression of cell-related markers such as PAX2, GATA3, OSR1, WT1, and OVGP1. Further differentiation to a FTE lineage was obtained on a 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure. Importantly, staining of secretory and ciliated cellular components demonstrated that these structures accurately model fallopian tube function. An iPSC-derived fallopian tube organoid model does not require patient biopsy because the Inventors can generate iPSC from blood cells or skin cells even with known genetic mutations.",
                        "Therefore, the Inventors believe the iPSC-derived FTE organoid system could be more beneficial and an ideal platform for identifying the molecular mechanisms leading to early pathogenesis and recapitulating ovarian cancer progression in a controlled environment with high risk mutations.",

                                "The mesoderm differentiates into the IM, in a sequential manner determined by the differential expression of specific transcription factors in response to signaling pathways, including WNT, Nodal/Activin and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) (FIG. 1a, b). The IM subsequently develops in parallel into both the FTE and kidney. At 6 weeks post-fertilization, mesonephric ducts are formed and develop separately into the M\u00fcllerian ducts. There are several protocols for kidney development, which primarily utilize signaling molecules in various temporal combinations (FIG. 1b). However, no successful protocol exists, to date, for iPSC development into fallopian tube.",
                                "In order to create a specific 3D iPSC-derived model of FTE, the Inventors used three different human iPSC lines (87iCTR-n3, 01iMEC-n4, 14iCTR-n6) that were reprogrammed initially from B-cells, mammary epithelial cells and fibroblasts, respectively. Each line demonstrated the molecular hallmarks of pluripotent cells, including morphology, normal karyotype, alkaline phosphatase expression and pluripotency markers (FIG. 4), and they were able to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers (data not shown). The ideal IM differentiation platform was first established by investigating three published protocols for directed differentiation of iPSCs into kidney progenitor cells21-23. To determine the efficiency of mesoderm induction, PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to assess early mesoderm specific transcription factors MIXL1 and BRACHYURY. A protocol with 100 ng/ml of activin A and 3 \u03bcM of CHIR99021 rapidly and efficiently specified human iPSCs (line 87iCTR-n3) into mesoderm, which recapitulates Mae et al (2013) (FIG. 1c). All three human iPSC lines (87iCTR-n3, 01iMEC-n4, 14iCTR-n6) showed a similar pattern, though the differentiation potential varied slightly between lines (FIG. 5). The peak of BRACHYURY and MIXL1 expression at day 2 followed by subsequent downregulation is consistent with the transient expression of these genes during gastrulation. In addition, BRACHYURY protein production showed a similar kinetic pattern during cell differentiation (FIG. 1d).",
                                "The BMP signaling pathway, known to regulate mesodermal cell determination, was next examined to further specify mesoderm differentiation into IM. While the Mae et al (2013) protocol uses BMP7, results here showed that exposure to 100 ng/ml of BMP4 provided optimal mesoderm differentiation into IM, based on expression levels of early IM markers PAX2, OSR1 and GATA3 (FIG. 1e). Once again, all three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern of differentiation based on PAX2 expression, with slightly varying levels of differentiation between lines (FIG. 6a). As in FIG. 1c, BMP4 provided the expected transient upregulation of BRACHYURY and MIXL1 seen during gastrulation, which was not recapitulated with BMP7 treatment (FIG. 6b). Importantly, BMP4 has been shown to regulate early ovarian follicle development and the creation of neonatal mouse uterine epithelium. Notably, BMP4-induced IM was more prone to differentiate towards FTE compared to BMP7, as suggested by the intermediate upregulation of markers primed for the female reproductive tract, namely WT1 (FIG. 1e). In parallel to mesoderm and IM gene induction, the expression of pluripotency genes POU5F1, SOX2 and TDGF1 was reduced (FIG. 1f). This new differentiation protocol that included BMP4 appears to be mostly specific for mesoderm, as there was no to very low detectable expression levels for the endoderm-marker SOX17 and the ectoderm-marker NCAM (FIG. 6c).",
                                "Collectively, these data show that human iPSCs can be differentiated into mesoderm and IM. Critically, compared to other tested protocols, this newly developed protocol with BMP4 yielded the highest level of mesoderm and IM differentiation.",

                                "Female tract differentiation requires WNT4 for initiation and elongation phases of M\u00fcllerian duct formation and subsequently requires the downstream component, Follistatin, to form the M\u00fcllerian duct. In order to differentiate IM into FTE, cultures were treated with 100 ng/ml of WNT4 on day 4 followed by 20 ng/ml of Follistatin on day 6 (FIG. 2a). M\u00fcllerian duct formation was confirmed by both PCR and immunocytochemistry, which showed upregulated expression over time of the fallopian tube precursor markers WT1 and OVGP1 (FIG. 2b-c). Importantly, this protocol was specific to M\u00fcllerian duct differentiation, given the lack of expression of the kidney markers SIX2 and FOXD1 (FIG. 2d, black bars), as well as the intestinal and lung markers CDX2 and NKX2-1, respectively (FIG. 7a,b). Interestingly, WNT4 along with prolonged CHIR99021 exposure led to the expression of early mesonephric duct markers HOXB7 and GATA3 (FIG. 8a,b). However, compared to WNT4 alone (FIG. 2b), FTE markers WT1 and OVGP1 did not show increased expression (FIG. 8c,d). Additionally, as with WNT4 alone (FIG. 2d), WNT4/CHIR did not induce expression of kidney progenitor markers SIX2 and FOXD1 (FIG. 8e,f). This suggests that continued CHIR99021 during WNT4 treatment might induce other WNT signaling factors that actually disrupt further M\u00fcllerian development.",
                                "Since M\u00fcllerian duct development occurs in parallel to nephric duct, the kinetics of kidney progenitor formation using the Inventors' new differentiation protocol were also characterized. Treating cultures with WNT3A led to increased expression of the renal marker SIX2 and FOXD1, suggesting the formation of the nephric duct and uteric bud and recapitulating published protocols (FIG. 2d, grey bars). Importantly, this protocol was specific to Mullerian duct differentiation, demonstrated by the lack of expression of the early kidney markers SIX2, FOXD1, and PAX8 (FIG. 2d, FIG. 11a black bars and FIG. 11b red channel). In contrast, WNT3A treatment did not yield differentiated M\u00fcllerian duct, based on the nearly 10-fold decreased levels of WT1 and OVGP1 compared to WNT4 treatment in FIG. 2b (FIG. 2e). Collectively these results demonstrate that activation of WNT4 followed by Follistatin can selectively differentiate IM into FTE precursor cells.",

                                "**Generation and Progressive Maturation of Fallopian Tube Organoid Over Time**",
                                "Remarkably, BMP4- and CHIR99021-treated cultures underwent morphogenesis that was similar to embryonic development. Between 3-5 days of treatment, flat cell sheets condensed into epithelial buds (FIG. 12). Once harvested, these buds formed spheroids, which were placed into Matrigel beads along with pro-M\u00fcllerian growth factors. Since optimal IM formed at day 4, spheroids were collected on days 3 to 6. Day 4 was ideal for collection of spheroids, as cells collected on day 3 were immature and grew with unstable structure in Matrigel and spheriods collected after day 6 did not persist in culture. When these spheroids were grown in Matrigel that contained phenol red, they formed an organoid structure (FIG. 9a). In contrast, when spheroids were grown in Matrigel not containing phenol red, they became branched and formed an unorganized matrix (FIG. 9b). As phenol red is a weak estrogen mimic, these results indicate the significance of estrogen on FTE differentiation and maturation",
                                "While the estrogenic properties of phenol-red initially improved organoid growth and organization, it was unable to sustain the organoids over longer periods. Steroid hormones, and estrogen in particular, are known to regulate development of the female reproductive tract, and estrogen has been shown to mediate cellular proliferation and differentiation during embryogenesis2. Therefore, to increase the architectural complexity and gain the structure of the plicae, fallopian tube organoids were exposed to estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) (FIG. 3a). In addition, conditioned media from FTE cells freshly isolated from patient tissue was used to provide other factors in the fallopian tube milieu that may be necessary for fallopian tube development.",
                                "This optimized protocol provided long-term organoids in matrigel that displayed luminal structures (FIG. 3a,b). Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that these fallopian tube structures contained ciliated (TUBB4A and FOXJ1) and secretory (PAX8) cellular components (FIG. 3c-e). However, these markers were found throughout the organoid, instead of in specific fallopian tube compartments as would be expected in mature FTE. In addition, there was no expression of the mature epithelial cell marker CHD1 (FIG. 3e). Also, immunocytochemistry confirmed the lack of expression of kidney marker SIX2, compared to WNT3a treatment as a positive control for kidney differentiation (FIG. 10a,b) Collectively, this suggests that while FTE precursor cells were detected in day 14 organoids, functional maturation of FTE required two months, similar to the timeline for human development.",
                                "To obtain functional maturation of FTE, the iPSC-derived FTE organoids were extended in culture in 3D Matrigel for an extended period with estrogen and progesterone supplemented media. Immunocytochemistry at day 30 showed that secretory cell marker PAX8 and ciliated cell marker TUBB4A, as well as the epithelial cell marker CDH1, exhibited similar expression patterns in FTE organoids model from two different iPSC lines (FIG. 13), Results at 45 days showed that the FTE cil ated marker, TUBB4A, and secretory cell markers, OVGP1 and PAX8 and the epithelial cell marker, CDH1, were now expressed in the expected sub-compartments seen in mature FTE, with TUBB4A being highly expressed along the lumen (FIG. 3f, FIG. 14). Importantly, the cellular expression and organization was comparable to fresh human fallopian tube tissue (FIG. 3f). The differentiation of iPSC-derived organoids into fallopian tube mature cells overtime was further demonstrated heat map analysis, which showed increased expression of fallopian tube-specific ciliated markers, FOXJ1 and secretory cell markers, OVGP1 that were similar to human fallopian tube tissue (FIG. 3g). Critically, iPSC-derived FTE organoids not only expressed both ciliated and secretory cell markers but also they formed visible cilia, further demonstrating that this novel model closely mimics the proper physiology and anatomy of the human FTE (FIG. 3h).",

                                "Human iPSCs are derived using technologies to reprogram adult cells back to a pluripotent state with the subsequent potential to differentiated into any cell type. Reprogramming to human iPSC possesses the essential advantages of eliminating the requirement for embryonic material while allowing for the generation of pluripotent cells with known genetic factor in a patient-specific manner. Moreover, combined with 3D cell culture techniques, 3D-iPSC derived organoid models can be developed which reconstitute features of organs, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of traditional monolayer cell culture systems by mimicking more closely the complex cellular heterogeneity and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions.",
                                "Intermediate mesoderm generates several components of the urogenital system, including reproductive tracts and also the kidneys, the gonads, and their respective duct systems. Priming the IM into only the desired cell fate has been a challenge for the iPSC-derived organoid model. To the Inventors' knowledge, all established iPSC-derived IM platforms have been developed to model the kidney formation using the combination of WNT, Nodal/Activin, and BMP signaling pathways. In this study, different WNT signaling pathways were modulated to successfully develop a novel differentiation protocol with key components to drive M\u00fcllerian duct and the female reproductive tract development rather than kidney. The most efficient differentiation platform to mimic embryonic fallopian tube development used CHIR99021 and activin A, along with BMP4 that was discovered to be critical for conversion of IM into female reproductive tract or M\u00fcllerian duct. To the Inventors' knowledge, this study presents the first iPSC-derived FTE in vitro model. The Inventors have demonstrated direct differentiation of human iPSCs into a fallopian tube-like precursor cells and, moreover, established iPSC-derived human fallopian tube organoids that recapitulate complexity of 3D architecture of FTE tissue.",
                                "During embryogenesis, WNT signaling pathways play a prominent role in regulating cell fate specification and in determining cell polarity and migration. WNT signaling is often correlated with cell proliferation and tissue repair after acute injury, rather than with differentiation of stem cells into adult tissues. However, recent human FTE organoid models with bi-potent FTE stem cells indicated the function of WNT3A in fallopian epithelial renewal and the regulation of stemness, suggesting the distinct role of WNT pathways in embryonic development and adult stem cell function. The current study found that activation of WNT4, instead of WNT3A, and activation of the downstream effector Follistatin were vital to specify IM differentiation into M\u00fcllerian duct and an FTE cell fate in vitro. Interestingly, the Inventors also showed that subsequent activation of WNT3A rather than WNT4 promoted nephric duct formation, which reflects the different molecular ability of WNTs to regulate specific cell fates.",
                                "Many fundamental cellular processes are differentially regulated between 2D and 3D cultures. Exposure of differentiated iPSCs to a 3D growth platform enabled them to self-organize into luminal structures that model fallopian tube function with secretory and ciliated cell components. Critically, the exposure to primary fallopian tube epithelial conditioned media is required for maintenance of 3D FTE luminal structure and architecture, indicating that there are unknown factors responsible for the organization of cellular structure of the fallopian tube.",
                                "In this study, the Inventors generated the basis platform for direct differentiation of iPSC into fallopian tube epithelial cell, however there is room for further improvement with regard to long term culturing and functional maturity. The growth and successful cultivation may dependent on different cell-matrix interactions and some other growth factors, which needs to further address.",
                                "Induced PSC-based in vitro models of cancer can help to understand pathological processes at the molecular and cellular level. In addition, they provide a critical platform to study drug resistance and to develop novel drug therapies. Importantly for ovarian cancer, iPSC-derived fallopian tube organoids can provide a faithful human cellular model to investigate the fallopian tube origin of serous carcinogenesis in ovarian cancer and to explore early cancer pathogenesis and progression. This platform can also be used study germline mutations that effect ovarian cancer development and to identify the critical steps and the order of genetic alterations involved with high grade serous carcinogenesis. In summary, iPSC-derived fallopian tube epithelium provides a powerful in vitro model of ovarian cancer that can be used to recapitulate early de novo genomic alterations, faithfully model disease progression and ultimately uncover novel treatments.",
