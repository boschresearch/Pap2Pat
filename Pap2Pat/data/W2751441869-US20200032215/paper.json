    "abstract": "The fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) has been recognized as a site of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). However, the absence of relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture has hindered our understanding of FTE transformation and initiation of HGSC. Here, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used to establish a novel 3-dimensional (3D) human FTE organoid in vitro model containing the relevant cell types of the human fallopian tube as well as a luminal architecture that closely reflects the organization of fallopian tissues in vivo . Modulation of Wnt and BMP signaling directed iPSC differentiation into M\u00fcllerian cells and subsequent use of pro-M\u00fcllerian growth factors promoted FTE precursors. The expression and localization of M\u00fcllerian markers verified correct cellular differentiation. An innovative 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure, permitted matured differentiation to a FTE lineage. This powerful human-derived FTE organoid model can be used to study the earliest stages of HGSC development and to identify novel and specific biomarkers of early fallopian tube epithelial cell transformation.",

                "High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (~70%), has the highest mortality rate among all gynecological cancers1. HSGC patients have poor prognoses due to a combination of factors including late stage at diagnosis and a high predilection for developing drug resistance. It is now accepted that the majority of HGSCs arise from the secretory cells of the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE). The discovery of in situ lesions in the fallopian tube fimbriae, namely serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), supports the concept of the FTE origin of serous \u201covarian\u201d carcinoma2\u20136. The discovery of an extra-ovarian origin of ovarian cancer is a fundamental advance toward improving early detection, prevention and treatment of this lethal disease. However, the lack of relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture and study early alterations has hindered the further understanding of FTE transformation as well as the initiation and progression of HGSC.",
                "Fallopian tube epithelium is composed of a polarized columnar epithelium including ciliated and secretory cells. Current fallopian tube models, including ex vivo and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models, demonstrate the importance of cell polarity in recreating secretory and ciliated cells7\u20139. However, FTE cells in these models have a reduced proliferation rate and induced senescence because of the lack of convoluted luminal architecture and the ectopic microenvironment7\u20139. Mouse models, including patient-derived xenografts and genetically engineered mice, have overcome some of these limitations and yielded significant insights into the basis of cancer development10\u201314. However, the complexity of a human tumor is not reliably represented in mouse models. Furthermore, it has been challenging to engineer silent and expressed mutations with the correct expression timeframe as well as accurate targeting to specific tissue and cell types, such as the secretory cell of the fallopian tube.",
                "Alternatively, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and 3D-tissue engineering provide powerful tools to recapitulate physiologically relevant aspects of disease progression in vitro. iPSCs are generated by reprogramming somatic cells and can be subsequently differentiated into various cell types15, 16. Recently, patient-derived iPSCs have been used to model several inherited human diseases and to successfully generate relevant cell types that display disease pathogenesis17\u201320. However, remaining challenges with iPSC-based modeling include establishing direct differentiation protocols for desired cell types and integrating the differentiated cells into functional tissue structures.",
                "Here, we describe a rapid and efficient method to create an iPSC-derived 3D model of human FTE with the desired cell types and luminal architecture. The female reproductive tract, including FTE, arises from the M\u00fcllerian duct in parallel to the urinary system from intermediate mesoderm (IM) of the urogenital ridge in the posterior primitive streak. We have recapitulated M\u00fcllerian development in vitro by inducing IM differentiation and further developed FTE precursors by adding pro-M\u00fcllerian growth factors. Correct differentiation was monitored through the expression of cell-related markers such as PAX2, GATA3, OSR1, WT1, and OVGP1 at each step. Further FTE lineage differentiation was obtained on a 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure. Importantly, staining of secretory and ciliated cellular components demonstrated that these structures accurately model fallopian tube architecture."

The IM subsequently develops in parallel into both the fallopian tube and kidney in humans (Fig.\u00a01a,b). At 6 weeks post-fertilization, mesonephric ducts are formed and develop separately into the M\u00fcllerian ducts. There are several protocols for kidney development, which primarily utilize signaling molecules in various temporal combinations21\u201323. However, no successful protocol exists, to date, for iPSC development into the fallopian tube epithelial cells.Figure 1Differentiation of Human iPSC into Intermediate Mesoderm-Like Cells.

                        "In order to create a specific 3D iPSC-derived model of FTE and study the cell of origin effect on FTE differentiation, we used three different female human iPSC lines (87iCTR-n3, 01iMEC-n4, 14iCTR-n6) that were reprogrammed initially from B-cells (from blood), mammary epithelial cells (from mammary epithelium biopsy), and fibroblasts (from skin biopsy), respectively (S1 Table). Each line demonstrated the molecular hallmarks of pluripotent cells, including morphology, normal karyotype, expression of alkaline phosphatase and pluripotency markers (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). The ideal IM differentiation platform was first established by investigating three published protocols for directed differentiation of iPSCs into kidney progenitor cells21\u201323. To determine the efficiency of mesoderm induction, PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to assess expression of early mesoderm specific transcription factors MIXL1 and BRACHYURY. Out of the three protocols tested, we found that 100\u2009ng/ml of activin A with 3\u2009\u03bcM of CHIR99021, a potent GSK-3b inhibitor and canonical WNT pathway agonist, rapidly and efficiently specified human iPSCs (line 87iCTR-n3) into mesoderm, which recapitulates Mae et al. (Fig.\u00a01c)21. All three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern, though the differentiation potential varied slightly between lines (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). The peak of BRACHYURY and MIXL1 expression at day 2 followed by subsequent downregulation is consistent with the transient expression of these genes during gastrulation. In addition, BRACHYURY protein production showed a similar kinetic pattern during cell differentiation (Fig.\u00a01d).",
                        "To optimize the efficiency of generating IM cells from mesoderm, we next examined the BMP signaling, which is known to regulate mesodermal cell type fate and further specification into IM24, 25. Importantly, BMP4 has been shown to regulate early ovarian follicle development and the creation of neonatal mouse uterine epithelium26, 27. While the Mae et al.21 protocol uses 100\u2009ng/ml of BMP7 with 3\u2009\u03bcM of CHIR99021, results here showed that exposure to 100\u2009ng/ml of BMP4 with 3\u2009\u03bcM of CHIR99021 provided a transient upregulation of BRACHYURY and MIXL1 that is seen during gastrulation, which was not recapitulated with BMP7 treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a). The combination of BMP4 and CHIR99021 also guided the optimal mesoderm differentiation into IM, which is shown by the expression levels of early IM markers PAX2, OSR1 and GATA3 (Fig.\u00a01e). Once again, all three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern of differentiation based on PAX2 expression, with slightly varying levels of differentiation between lines (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). Remarkably, BMP4-induced IM was more prone to differentiate towards FTE compared to BMP7, as suggested by the intermediate upregulation of markers primed for the female reproductive tract, namely WT1 (Fig.\u00a01e). In parallel, the induction of mesoderm and IM genes was complemented by the loss of pluripotency, as reflected by a reduction of expression of pluripotency genes POU5F1, SOX2 and TDGF1 (Fig.\u00a01f). Notably, a minimal amount of endoderm and ectoderm was also derived, demonstrated by low expression of SOX17 (endoderm) and NCAM (ectoderm) during differentiation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c). Collectively, these data show that this differentiation protocol with BMP4 appears to be mostly specific for mesodermal linages and yielded the highest level of mesoderm and IM differentiation."

                        "The canonical WNT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the embryo during development and FTE formation. A subset of WNT gene family members including WNT3a and WNT4 are required for the initiation and elongation phases of M\u00fcllerian duct formation as well as for suppression of male differentiation pathways28, 29. To complete our FTE differentiation protocol, we defined the role of these WNT signaling in our in vitro model. Our result showed that cultures that were treated with 100\u2009ng/ml of WNT4 on day 4 followed by 20\u2009ng/ml of its downstream component Follistatin, which binds and bioneutralizes members of the TGF-beta superfamily, were more prone to differentiate into FTE (Fig.\u00a02a). M\u00fcllerian duct differentiation was confirmed by both PCR and immunocytochemistry, which showed upregulated expression over time of the fallopian tube precursor markers WT1 and OVGP1 (Fig.\u00a02b,c). Importantly, this protocol was specific to M\u00fcllerian duct differentiation, demonstrated by the lack of expression of the early kidney markers SIX2, FOXD1, and PAX8 (Fig.\u00a02d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, black bars and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b red channel), as well as lack of the intestinal and lung markers CDX2 and NKX2-1, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a,b). Interestingly, WNT4 along with prolonged CHIR99021 exposure led to the expression of early mesonephric duct markers HOXB7 and GATA3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a,b). However, compared to WNT4 alone (Fig.\u00a02b), FTE markers WT1 and OVGP1 did not show increased expression in WNT4/CHIR99021 treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c,d). Additionally, as with WNT4 alone (Fig.\u00a02d), WNT4/CHIR99021 did not induce expression of kidney progenitor markers SIX2 and FOXD1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06e,f). This suggests that continued CHIR99021 during WNT4 treatment might induce other WNT signaling factors that disrupt further M\u00fcllerian development.Figure 2Differentiation of Intermediate Mesoderm into Fallopian Tube Epithelium Cells.

                        "Since M\u00fcllerian duct development occurs in parallel to the nephric duct, we also characterized the kinetics of kidney progenitor formation using our differentiation protocol. As in published protocols, treating cultures with WNT3A led to increased expression of the renal markers SIX2, FOXD1 and PAX8, promoting the formation of the nephric duct and ureteric bud (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, gray bars and 4c red channel)21, 30. In contrast, WNT3A treatment did not yield differentiated M\u00fcllerian duct, based on the nearly 10-fold decreased levels of WT1 and OVGP1 compared to WNT4 treatment in Fig.\u00a02b (Fig.\u00a02e). Collectively these results demonstrate that activation of WNT4 followed by Follistatin can selectively differentiate IM into FTE precursor cells."

                        "Remarkably, BMP4- and CHIR99021-treated cultures underwent morphogenesis that was similar to embryonic development. Between 3\u20135 days of treatment, flat cell sheets condensed into epithelial buds (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). Once harvested, these buds formed spheroids, which were placed into Matrigel beads along with pro-M\u00fcllerian growth factors. Since optimal IM formed at day 4, spheroids were collected on days 3 to 6. Day 4 was ideal for collection of spheroids, as cells collected on day 3 were immature and grew with unstable structure in Matrigel and spheroids collected after day 6 did not persist in culture (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). When these spheroids were grown in Matrigel that contained phenol red, they formed an organoid structure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a). In contrast, when spheroids were grown in Matrigel not containing phenol red, they became branched and formed an unorganized matrix (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08b). As phenol red is a weak estrogen mimic, these results indicate the significance of estrogen on FTE differentiation and maturation.",
                        "While the estrogenic properties of phenol red initially improved organoid growth and organization, it was unable to sustain the organoids over longer periods. Steroid hormones, and estrogen in particular, are known to regulate development of the female reproductive tract, and estrogen has been shown to mediate cellular proliferation and differentiation during embryogenesis31, 32. Therefore, to increase the architectural complexity and gain the structure of the plicae, fallopian tube organoids were exposed to estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) (Fig.\u00a03a). In addition, conditioned media from FTE cells freshly isolated from patient tissue was used to provide other unknown factors in the fallopian tube milieu that may be necessary for fallopian tube development.Figure 3Development and Characterization of an iPSC-Derived Fallopian Tube Organoid.

Immunocytochemistry at day 30 showed that secretory cell marker PAX8 and ciliated cell marker TUBB4A, as well as the epithelial cell marker CDH1, exhibited similar expression patterns in FTE organoids model from two different iPSC lines (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010), thereby demonstrating biological replicates between cell lines and technical replicates within the same cell line. Results at 45 days showed that the FTE ciliated marker, TUBB4A, and secretory cell markers, OVGP1 and PAX8 and the epithelial cell marker, CDH1, were now expressed in the expected sub-compartments seen in mature FTE, with TUBB4A being highly expressed along the lumen (Fig.\u00a03f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a011). The cellular phenotype and organization of the iPSC-derived FTE organoids were comparable to fresh human fallopian tube tissue (Fig.\u00a03f).

Reprogramming to human iPSCs possesses the essential advantages of eliminating the requirement for embryonic material while allowing for the generation of pluripotent cells with known genetic factors in a patient-specific manner. Moreover, combined with 3D cell culture techniques, 3D iPSC-derived organoid models can be developed to reconstitute features of organs by mimicking more closely the complex cellular heterogeneity and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of traditional monolayer cell culture systems.",
                "Intermediate mesoderm generates several components of the urogenital system, including reproductive tracts and also the kidneys, the gonads, and their respective duct systems. Priming the IM into only the desired cell fate has been a challenge for the iPSC-derived organoid model. To our knowledge, all established iPSC-derived IM platforms have been developed to model the kidney formation using the combination of WNT, Nodal/Activin, and BMP signaling21\u201323. In this study, different WNT signaling was modulated to successfully develop a novel differentiation protocol with key components to drive M\u00fcllerian duct and the female reproductive tract development rather than kidney. The most efficient differentiation platform to mimic embryonic fallopian tube development used CHIR99021 and activin A, along with BMP4 that was discovered to be critical for conversion of IM into female reproductive tract or M\u00fcllerian duct. To our knowledge, this study presents the first iPSC-derived FTE in vitro model. We have demonstrated direct differentiation of human iPSCs into fallopian tube-like precursor cells and, moreover, established iPSC-derived human fallopian tube organoids that recapitulate the complex 3D architecture of FTE tissue.",
                "During embryogenesis, WNT signaling pathways play a prominent role in regulating cell fate specification and in determining cell polarity and migration. WNT signaling is often correlated with cell proliferation and tissue repair after acute injury. However, recent human FTE organoid models with bi-potent FTE stem cells indicated the function of WNT3A in fallopian epithelial renewal and the regulation of stemness, suggesting the distinct role of WNT pathways in embryonic development and adult stem cell function33. The current study found that exposure to WNT4, instead of WNT3A, and activation of the downstream effector Follistatin were vital to specify IM differentiation into M\u00fcllerian duct and an FTE cell fate in vitro. Interestingly, we also showed that subsequent activation of WNT3A rather than WNT4 promoted nephric duct formation, which reflects the different molecular ability of WNTs to regulate specific cell fates.",
                "Many fundamental cellular processes are differentially regulated between 2D and 3D cultures8, 34, 35. Exposure of differentiated iPSCs to a 3D growth platform enabled them to self-organize into luminal structures that model fallopian tube structure with secretory and ciliated cell components. Critically, the exposure to primary fallopian tube epithelial conditioned media is required for maintenance of 3D FTE luminal structure and architecture, indicating that there are unknown factors responsible for the organization of cellular structure of the fallopian tube.",
                "In this study, we generated the basis of a platform for directed differentiation of iPSCs into fallopian tube epithelial cells, however, there is room for further improvement with regard to long-term culturing and functional maturity. Growth and successful cultivation may depend on different cell-matrix interactions and other growth factors that need to be further studied.",
                "iPSC-based in vitro models of cancer can help to understand pathological processes at the molecular and cellular level. In addition, they potentially provide a critical platform to study drug resistance and to develop novel therapies. Importantly for ovarian cancer, iPSC-derived fallopian tube organoids can provide a faithful human cellular model to investigate the fallopian tube origin of serous carcinogenesis in ovarian cancer and to explore early cancer pathogenesis and progression. This platform can also be used study germline mutations that affect ovarian cancer development and to identify the critical steps and the sequence of genetic alterations involved in high grade serous carcinogenesis. In summary, iPSC-derived fallopian tube epithelium provides a powerful in vitro model of ovarian cancer that can recapitulate early de novo genomic alterations, faithfully model disease progression and ultimately uncover novel treatments."
