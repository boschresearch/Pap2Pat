Some probes made in this fashion may be prone to failure due to delamination or a degradation of the adhesion. Depending on the materials used, some probes may fail due to a lack of tensile strength or due to repetitive stress and strain. Some probes have been found to cause tissue damage and/or trigger an immune response in patients or test subjects. Due in part to their size, some large probes can be difficult to place with a high degree of precision, which can lead to less accurate measurements, less accurate test results, and/or less effective therapies. Also due to in part to their size, large probes can also increase the likelihood of tissue damage and/or trigger an immune response in the patient or test subject.",

The mechanical strength of sample probes were measured using an Instron 1500HDX Universal Testing Machine (Instron, USA), where tensile load may be applied until failure, and the resulting extension measured. Probes with dimensions of 17 mm in length, 0.5 mm in width and 50 mm in thickness were used for the tests mechanical strength tests. Attachment of strain gauge extensometers directly to the probes was not practical because the devices were too thin. Instead, linear displacement due to the crosshead motion of Instron was used to obtain displacement values. Thread-rolled C-clamps with clamping capacity of 0-25 mm were used to grip the probes. The frame of C-clamps was then held between the jaws of the upper and lower clamps of the Instron machine. The cross-head extension rate was set to 0.5 mm/min. The probe was then loaded to failure at this rate and the load-deflection curve plotted. For comparison purposes, sample probes of similar geometry were used consisting of 200 nm thick metal (Pt) electrodes and wire traces, microfabricated through a standard metal lift-off process. Subsequently, the load-deflection curves and ultimate load carrying capacity of the thin-film metal probes were determined in a similar fashion. Young's Modulus was determined by taking the mean slope of ten points in the elastic region of the stress-strain curve. The modulus of plain Durimide insulating layer with no metal or glassy carbon traces and electrodes was also determined separately to de-couple its effect from the composite structure.",

                        "Electrical, Electrochemical, and Stability Characterizations. The electrochemical behavior of the electrodes was studied in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS; 0.01 M, pH 7.4; Sigma Aldrich, USA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to quantify capacitive charging and electrode stability while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the electrical properties of the sample probes over a large range of frequencies. In both CV and EIS tests, potentiostat (Reference 600+, Gamry Instruments, USA) was connected to a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum wire as a counter electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode. During CV tests, the working electrode potential was swept between 1.3 V and \u22120.9 V (water window of glassy carbon), maintaining a scan rate of 100 mV/s. The total charge storage capacity (CSC) was calculated from the time integral of a CV cycle. During EIS measurements, 10 mV RMS amplitude sine wave was superimposed on a 0 V potential with frequency sweep from 0.1 to 105 Hz. Equivalent circuit modeling of the EIS data was done through Gamry Echem Analyst Vn 7.05 software (Gamry Instruments, USA). For accelerated aging tests, including prolonged current stimulation pattern tests, cathodic-first charge balanced bi-phasic current pulses were used with 450 \u03bcA amplitude, 400 msec cathodic half-phase period and a frequency of 1 kHz in a saline solution (0.01 M PBS) using a Gamry Instruments Virtual Front Panel (Gamry Instruments, PA, USA). This accelerated aging test corresponds to charge density of 0.25 mC/cm2 and was applied over a period of 1000 hours. Voltage transient responses during stimulation were acquired using the same potentiostat (for example, PARSTAT 2273, available from Princeton Applied Research, USA) by simultaneously injecting stimulation current pulses and recording the corresponding voltage excursions between working and counter electrodes. In regular intervals, impedance was measured and the integrity of the electrodes checked. The buffer pH was measured regularly during accelerated aging test using pH/mv/ion benchtop meter (Jenco Electronics, TX).",

The duration of each scan was 9 ms (900 data points). Prior to the beginning of each experiment, the same voltage waveform was applied to the electrodes at 60 Hz for 1 hour for activating the carbon surface of the electrodes. Known concentrations of dopamine (10 nM-1 mM) were then infused over 5 seconds while changes in current were recorded for 20 seconds.",

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition) and approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 4265-01. Adult female Long-Evans rats (300 g) were used in this study and anesthesia was induced with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. The animal was placed in a stereotaxic frame and a craniotomy made 1.5 mm rostral and 4.5 mm caudal to the bregma and 1 mm lateral and 7 mm lateral to the midline, targeting the left forelimb sensorimotor cortex. A probe, as described herein, was then placed on the dura and stabilized by gel foam dental cement. A reference wire was connected to a screw on the right parietal bone while a ground wire was connected to a screw on the occipital bone. Throughout the entire procedure, body temperature of the animal was maintained with a heating pad placed under it.",
                        "Electrophysiology Recording. Brain signal recording sessions were carried out under anesthesia, 4 days after array implantation. An implanted aCG probe configured as an ECoG microarray was connected to a multichannel data acquisition system (Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL) through an active (unity-gain) head-stage. Sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were obtained by applying bipolar surface stimulation to the surface of skin of the right wrist of an anesthetized rat. Recorded data was digitized at 24.4 kHz and stored on a PC for further analysis. Subsequently, raw signals were bandpass filtered (1-450 Hz, 4th order Butterworth, zero-phase) and down-sampled to 1 kHz using Matlab software (Mathworks, Inc., MA). Low-frequency brain activity in evoked SEPs were eliminated by a high-pass filter (30 Hz, 4th order Butterworth, zero-phase). In each recording session, 15 single, bi-phasic, squared wave stimulation pulses (pulse width: 500 \u03bcs, pulse amplitude: 0.5 mA-2 mA, 0.5 Hz) were applied to the surface electrodes and evoked response from 5 ms to 55 ms after stimulation onset were averaged to obtain average SEPs. The extracted evoked response between 5 ms to 55 ms after stimulation onset was considered as an estimate for the signal, while the extracted spontaneous activity corresponding to 65 ms to 115 ms after stimulation onset was taken as an estimate for the background noise. Subsequently, SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of ECoG electrodes placed in six different positions across forelimb sensory cortex were evaluated. The SNR value for each trial was defined as the ratio between the variance of selected signal (evoked response) and the variance of selected noise (spontaneous activity). The calculated SNR (mean\u00b1standard deviation) of all channels was used as a useful indication of the quality of brain-signal recording. Furthermore, to show temporal-spectral representation of recorded data by glassy carbon electrodes, the spectrogram of each ECoG channel were computed by applying 256 ms Hanning window on each ECoG time-series. The corresponding short-time Fourier transform of each segment was then computed using 200 ms overlap.",

                        "For comparison purposes, tensile load tests were carried out on sample probes with thin-film metal (Pt) electrodes. The load carrying capacity for both types of probes was directly obtained from the load-deflection curves and the resulting failure planes in transverse direction were further investigated using SEM. The probes described herein failed at a tensile load of about 12 N at 1 mm extension with clearly defined elastic and plastic regions observed in the load-deflection curves. On the other hand, sample probes microfabricated with thin-film metal (Pt) electrodes and traces failed at an ultimate tensile load of 5 N at 0.7 mm extension. For both thin-film metal and glassy carbon traces, the failure plane as shown at 1660A-B passes through the traces with no jagged discontinuity, suggesting a strong bond between Durimide and the respective metal or glassy carbon layer. The Young's Modulus of the composite structure with glassy carbon electrodes and traces was calculated to be about 2.65 GPa whereas it was about 2.59 GPa for probes with Pt electrodes and traces. The modulus of probes was slightly higher than that of plain Durimide (2.5 GPa) suggesting a strong composite action between glassy carbon and polyimide. Optical observation revealed several micro-cracks in the thin-film metal traces near the failure plane (1660A), whereas only a single additional crack was seen in the otherwise intact glassy carbon trace 1660B), indicating different failure modes in the two types of probes. The extent of micro cracks in the thin-film metal electrodes suggests that they were progressively produced during loading resulting in earlier onset of electrical connection failure. For probes, failure in the traces under tensile load occurred at higher load levels preceding plastic failure as compared to other probes. Stiffness of probes in compression was determined through the Euler buckling load: Pcr=p2EI/(KL)2, where E=Young's modulus, I=area moment of inertia (500 mm width and 50 mm depth), K=effective length factor (usually 1) and L=length of probe. For the intracortical penetrating probes reported here, Pcr=2.13 mN, which is substantially higher than about 1.5 mN force required to penetrate the cerebral cortex of a rat.",

Both plots show the components that contribute to the voltage transients (for example, Va, Eipp, Emc and Ema). Eipp is the inter-pulse potential. Va is defined as the near-instantaneous voltage change at either the onset of the current pulse or immediately after the current pulse is terminated. It is associated with the Ohmic electrolyte resistance and overpotential terms. Maximum positive polarization Ema=Vmax,pos\u2212Va whereas the maximum negative polarization Emc=Vmax,neg\u2212Va. The values of Emc and Ema for glassy carbon and Pt probes are (\u22120.75 V, 0 V) and (\u22121.75 V, 0.75 V) respectively, indicating a lower overpotential and lower-threshold for electrochemical kinetics of glassy carbon electrodes.",

These indicate an excellent range for micro-ECoG recording applications. The corresponding EIS plots are reported at 1770A. As the phase plot at 1770A shows, impedances at frequencies higher than 4 kHz are dominated by almost exclusively a resistive component. The results of cyclic voltammetry of glassy carbon electrodes at 1770B demonstrate an approximately rectangular shape, characteristic of electrodes exhibiting a predominantly double-layer capacitance. This is consistent with the behavior of pure carbon materials, indicating that no faradaic reactions occur during the charging and discharging process. CSC, calculated as the time-integral of an entire CV cycle between the water oxidation and reduction potential limits, is 61.4\u00b16.9 mC/cm2 (mean and standard deviation, n=10).",
                        "This capacitive charge injection mechanism is also confirmed by the voltage transient shape (FIG. 17 at 1770C) illustrating the comparison of voltage transients between glassy carbon and Pt electrodes with the same dimension of 300 \u03bcm diameter and comparable impedance. Traces are in response to a biphasic, symmetric current pulse of 450 \u03bcA amplitude and 400 msec of half-phase period. Due to the capacitive charge injection mechanism of glassy carbon electrodes, the amplitude of voltage transient for the same current level applied to both types of probes is much less in glassy carbon electrodes, producing maximum negative voltage (Vmax,neg) of \u22121.03 V and maximum positive voltage (Vmax,pos) of 0.25 V. These correspond to Ema (most negative polarization voltage) across electrode-electrolyte interface of \u22120.75 V and Ema (most positive polarization voltage) close to 0 V. These values are safely within the maximum potential limits of water reduction and oxidation for glassy carbon electrodes (for example, \u22120.9 to 1.3 V; 1770B). In contrast, for Pt electrodes, the corresponding Vmax,neg, Emc, Vmax,pos and Ema values are \u22122.25 V, \u22121.75 V, 1.07 V and 0.7 V, respectively. These values are substantially outside the maximum potentials corresponding to the water window of Pt at \u22120.6 V to 0.8 V. Note that the maximum negative potential excursion (Emc) is calculated by subtracting the access voltage (Va) associated with the Ohmic electrolyte resistance and overpotential terms from the maximum negative voltage in the transient (for example, Emc=Vmax,neg\u2212Va and Ema=Vmax,pos\u2212Va). Va may be defined as the near-instantaneous voltage change at either the onset of the current pulse or immediately after the current pulse is terminated. In this condition, Va is 0.36 V for glassy carbon and 0.48 V for Pt (33% higher for Pt), suggesting a substantially lower overpotential to be overcome in glassy carbon electrodes (FIG. 1770C-D.)

The CSC values increased from 45 mC/cm2 to 180 mC/cm2 after 0.2-3.5 billion cycles of pulsing. This increase in capacitance is predominantly due to continued surface activation that is very common in carbon electrodes.

                        "Sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) caused by the bi-phasic stimulation pulses on the right wrist were recorded via the ECoG aCG probe, as described herein, implanted on the left forelimb sensory cortex of an anesthetized rat. FIG. 21 at 2188A shows the craniotomy made targeting the left forelimb sensorimotor cortex where the probes were implanted. Plots of brain activities sampled from six channels of electrodes implanted in the sensory cortex four days after the implantation surgery are shown in FIG. 21 at 2188B. To verify the quality of brain recording using glassy carbon electrodes, the average-SEP of different channels were calculated in response to the surface electrical stimulation of hand area. FIG. 21 at 2188C shows a typical average-SEP (mean\u00b1standard error) of a single ECoG channel for 5 ms to 55 ms after stimulation onset, with average-spontaneous activity of the same ECoG channel for 65 ms to 115 ms after stimulation onset. The time frame between 5 ms to 55 ms was considered adequate to cover the entire SEP response, as all SEPs were observed in this time range. The large positive and negative response corresponding to 15 ms after stimulation onset demonstrates that the ECoG electrodes successfully recorded early response of sensory neurons in somatosensory cortex in the presence of background spontaneous activity.",
                        "FIG. 21 at 2188D shows the power spectrum of the same six channels. As can be seen, all of the electrodes recorded brain activities in physiological spectral range without interference from non-physiological noise such as power line noise. Further, Supplementary Figure S6 shows that the spectrograms representing brain signals could be recorded across different frequency bands using glassy carbon electrodes. In Table 4, the mean (\u00b1standard deviation) SNR value (16\u00b16) and impedance of all ECoG channels are shown. Collectively, the in-vivo tests demonstrate that the ECoG microarray can successfully record multi-site, temporal and spectral brain information with high SNR.",
                        "FIG. 22 summarizes results obtained from a series of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) characterizations using penetrating glassy carbon probes with a net surface area of 500 mm2. FIG. 22 at 2288A depicts an example of dopamine signals detected using a standard pyramidal FSCV waveform in which the applied voltage was ramped from the holding potential of \u22120.5 V to the switching potential of +1.3 V and then back to \u22120.5 V at 400 V/s scan-rate. In particular, the color plots show changes in current following the injection of 10 nM of dopamine (DA) at t=15 secs first and subsequently an additional 10 nM at t=25 sec in the base phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer. These changes in currents occurred at the known reduction and oxidation peaks of DA (i.e., \u22120.18 V and 0.62 V), as clearly shown in the background subtracted CVs for 10 nM and 20 nM dopamine given in FIG. 22 at 2288B. Further, to determine a calibration curve over a wider range of concentrations, additional sets of FSCV were carried out at 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 700 nM and 1 mM concentration of dopamine in PBS. As shown in FIG. 22 at 2288C, the background subtracted CVs corresponding to these range of concentrations demonstrate reduction and oxidation peaks at (\u22120.18 V) and (0.62 V). In addition, the calibration curve for these concentrations of dopamine varying from 10 nM to 1 mM follows a linear trend as reported in FIG. 22 at 2288D. This low detection limit of dopamine at 10 nM represents one of the lowest reported limits in the literature. Further, the capability of this platform for selective detection of dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) was also investigated. Ascorbic acid typically occurs in much higher concentration than that of dopamine (100-1000 times) and strongly interferes with dopamine detection. Hence, the determination of dopamine with high selectivity and sensitivity in presence of ascorbic acid is desirable for diagnostic applications. Glassy carbon electrodes were able to detect 50 nM dopamine in the presence of 1 mM ascorbic acid with high resolution. Background subtracted CVs showing reduction (\u22120.2 V) and oxidation (0.6 V) peaks of 50 nM and 500 nM of dopamine in presence of 1 mM ascorbic acid in PBS are reported in FIG. 22 at 2288E. The corresponding calibration curve shows a linear trend (FIG. 22 at 2288F.) This capability uniquely underscores an additional strong asset of glassy carbon electrodes in neurotransmitter detection through FSCV, a capability that is not matched by thin-film metal or metal oxide electrodes.",
                        "Probes, as described herein, may allow long-term electrical stimulation with minimal or undetectable material corrosion of the electrode. Cross-section characterization through focused ion beam (FIB) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging show a strong attachment enabled by hydroxyl and carbonyl covalent bonds between glassy carbon microstructures and between the first and second insulating layers. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro tests have shown that probes may have a dopamine detection in the range of 10 nM. These probes in particular may offer an improved multi-modal platform for long-term applications of probe technology in both experimental and clinical neuroscience.",
                        "Brain stimulation applications may require electrodes capable of hundreds of millions of cycles of electrical stimulation pulses at clinically relevant charge densities, corresponding to probes that may be implanted for a very long period of time, for example, 3 to 5 years. Glassy carbon probes, according to example embodiments, may be able to deliver this level of performance with minimal or undetectable corrosion, minimal or undetectable tissue damage, and minimal or undetectable delamination of insulating layers. Probes implemented in accordance with example embodiments may thus enable the transition of probe technology from lab use to clinical use, including, for example, deep brain stimulation and spinal stimulation used for neuromodulation or induction of neuroplasticity.",
