    "title": "N-Linked Glycosylation on Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1 Is Essential for Seneca Valley Virus Infection",
    "date": "2021-04-28",
    "abstract": "Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is a picornavirus with potency in selectively infecting and lysing cancerous cells. The cellular receptor for SVV mediating the selective tropism for tumors is anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), a type I transmembrane protein expressed in tumors. Similar to other mammalian receptors, ANTXR1 has been shown to harbor N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular vWA domain. However, the exact role of ANTXR1 glycosylation on SVV attachment and cellular entry was unknown. Here we show that N-linked glycosylation in the ANTXR1 vWA domain is necessary for SVV attachment and entry. In our study, tandem mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ANTXR1-Fc revealed the presence of complex glycans at N166, N184 in the vWA domain, and N81 in the Fc domain. Symmetry-expanded cryo-EM reconstruction of SVV-ANTXR1-Fc further validated the presence of N166 and N184 in the vWA domain. Cell blocking, co-immunoprecipitation, and plaque formation assays confirmed that deglycosylation of ANTXR1 prevents SVV attachment and subsequent entry. Overall, our results identified N-glycosylation in ANTXR1 as a necessary post-translational modification for establishing stable interactions with SVV. We anticipate our findings will aid in selecting patients for future cancer therapeutics, where screening for both ANTXR1 and its glycosylation could lead to an improved outcome from SVV therapy.",

                "Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is a small, non-enveloped RNA virus belonging to the genus Senecavirus in the family Picornaviridae [1]. The 7280 nucleotide (nt) long positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of SVV comprises a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR, 666 nt) and an open reading frame (ORF, 6543 nt) followed by a shorter 3\u2032 UTR of 71 nt and a poly adenosine (poly(A)) tail of unknown length. The SVV ORF encodes a single 2181 amino acid long polyprotein, which is later cleaved into a characteristic picornaviral protein layout, L-4-3-4 [1]. In this layout, L stands for the leader protein and 4-3-4 represents the four structural proteins VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1 and seven non-structural proteins 2A\u20132C and 3A\u20133D. In the SVV life cycle, two forms of particles exist: mature capsid with a packaged genome, and native empty capsid without RNA [2]. In both capsids, VP1 is arranged around the 5-fold axis, while VP2 and VP3 alternate around the 3-fold axis. VP4 is located in the capsid interior, forming contacts with the RNA near the 5-fold axis [2,3].",
                "Since its serendipitous discovery, phylogenetic analyses of SVV over a span of two decades have shed light on the existence of three distinct clades [4]. SVV-001 is grouped as the lone member in clade I without any reported association to human or animal pathogenicity. SVV-001 selectively infects and replicates in tumor cells of neuro-endocrine origin and has shown promise in cancer therapeutics [5]. SVV-001 has been tested as a therapeutic agent in pre-clinical studies and in Phase I/II clinical trials for treating pediatric solid tumors and small-cell lung cancer [6,7,8,9,10]. In contrast, strains in clades II and III are linked to idiopathic vesicular disease (IVD) and epidemic transient neonatal losses (ETNL) in swine [11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. Indistinguishable characteristics between SVV-associated IVD and historical swine diseases raise caution against the possible event of a major outbreak in the agricultural industry. Thus, in-depth knowledge of the virus biology\u2014in particular virus structure and host cell-receptor interactions\u2014could provide beneficial information in further exploiting this virus as a cancer therapeutic or as a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine.",
                "To date, more than 20 cellular receptors have been identified and characterized among the members of the Picornaviridae family. Picornavirus receptors mainly fall into the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), the structure of which consists of a single transmembrane domain and tandem repeats of two to five Ig-like domains that form contacts with the canyon in the viral capsid [18,19,20]. In addition, non-IgSF receptors, heparan sulfate [21,22], sialic acid [23], and complement control proteins act as receptors for some picornaviruses [24,25]. The high-affinity cellular receptor responsible for SVV attachment is anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) [26], a type I transmembrane protein with three domains: an extracellular N-terminal von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain [27]. ANTXR1, also known as tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), is expressed in approximately 60% of tumors but not in non-malignant cells [26]. Its homologous receptor, ANTXR2, is expressed on both healthy and tumor cells and acts as the main cellular receptor for the protective antigen of anthrax toxin secreted by the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis [28]. The cryo-EM structure of SVV-ANTXR1 showed that despite a large degree of structural and sequence conservation between the two receptors, the sequence along the SVV binding footprint shows divergence, thereby limiting SVV attachment only to ANTXR1 [29].",
                "Picornavirus receptors have commonly been found to undergo post-translational modifications, specifically glycosylation [18]. This glycosylation can be grouped broadly into receptors with either N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, or both N- and O-linked glycosylation [30]. N-glycosylation is the most prevalent type, accounting for an average of 0.94 glycosylation sites per 100 aa in mammalian receptors [31]. N-glycosylation has been well-documented for poliovirus receptor CD155 [32], coxsackievirus-A-virus (CVA) receptors ICAM-1 [33] and KREMEN-1 [34], coxsackie-B-virus (CVB) receptor CAR [35], enterovirus 71 (EV71) receptor SCARB [36], and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) receptor \u03b1V\u03b26 [37]. Glycan moieties were speculated to be involved in integrin receptor interactions with FMDV surface-exposed loops [37], whereas sialylation of SCARB enhanced the interactions with EV71 [36]. On the contrary, CD155 N-glycosylation in the D1 domain was shown to decrease its binding affinity to poliovirus [38]. Similar to other picornavirus receptors, the vWA domain in ANTXR1 harbors multiple glycans, which play a role in proper folding and trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface [39]. However, the functional role of ANTXR1 glycosylation with respect to SVV attachment or entry remains unknown.",
                "In this study, we characterized the glycosylation of recombinant ANTXR1 extracellular domain fused to a fragment-crystallizable (Fc) region and its importance in SVV-ANTXR1 interactions and cellular infection. Glycopeptide analysis of the recombinant ANTXR1 recognized three N-linked glycosylation sites in total: two localized to the ANTXR1 extracellular domain and one located in the Fc region. Local cryo-EM map refinement of the SVV-ANTXR1 asymmetric unit further confirmed the presence of N-glycosylated sites at N166 and N184 in the ANTXR1 vWA domain. A combination of co-immunoprecipitation assays and cellular infection experiments showed the necessity of ANTXR1 glycosylation for successful SVV attachment and cellular entry. The findings from this study could provide valuable insights into selecting cancer patients for SVV treatments or in designing inhibitors that can specifically block N-linked glycans in ANTXR1 to prevent SVV infection in swine."

Once the cytopathic effect (CPE) was confirmed after 48 h, cells were subjected to 3 repeated cycles of freeze-thawing to lyse the cells and release the virus. Lysed cells and medium were subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 30 min at 22 \u00b0C to pellet down the cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000\u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C using a Beckman Coulter SW32Ti rotor.

To better visualize the glycosylation sites in ANTXR1-Fc bound to SVV we sought to perform a localized reconstruction of one asymmetric unit. To achieve this, imposed I4 symmetry in the particle stack from final 3D refinement was relaxed to C1 symmetry using the relion_particle_symmetry_expand command, thus resulting in a particle stack of 406,920 symmetry related copies. This particle stack was subjected to 3D classification in Relion-3.1 using a custom mask created by UCSF Chimera \u201cVolume eraser\u201d tool, to include one asymmetric unit in SVV-ANTXR1-Fc, masking out the remainder of the complex. A cryo-EM map of SVV-ANTXR1-Fc low-pass filtered at 30 \u00c5 resolution was used as the starting reference. 3D classes from the latter step were further subjected to masked 3D refinement and post-processing in Relion-3.1 using the same 3D mask as before.

ANTXR1-Fc from Sino Biological was expressed and purified from HEK293 cells and therefore, was subject to similar glycosylation modifications as endogenous ANTXR1. PNGase F acts as a broad-spectrum enzyme that cleaves all N-linked hybrid or complex oligosaccharides found in plants and mammals, except in the presence of a core \u03b11, 3 fucose connected to asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) [45,46]. In such instances, the prior denaturation of protein is essential for an efficient cleavage by PNGase F. Therefore, we treated separate aliquots of ANTXR1-Fc with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Glu-C. A combination of different proteases allowed us to obtain spectra of glycopeptide ions accounting for all potential N-glycosylation sites. A portion of each digest was deglycosylated with PNGase F in 18O water to convert the glycan-modified asparagine to an 18O aspartic acid residue, causing a subtle mass shift of 3 Da [47].",

These findings were in agreement with previously discovered N-linked glycosylation sites in both ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 [39]. In our analysis, N166 and N184 were found to be heavily glycosylated. All N166 sites showed 100% glycan occupancy, while N184 sites were mostly glycosylated (Table 1). These glycosylated sites in the vWA domain carried both bi-antennary and tri-antennary sialylated and fucosylated complex glycans. Notably, some of the glycans in latter N-linked sites contained a LacdiNAc antenna in the structure. In addition, one sulfated N-glycan was shown to be linked to N184. Overall, the high degree of LacdiNAc expression, heavy fucosylation, and sulfation observed here showed similarities to glycoprotein expressed in human cell lines [48]."

In the original cryo-EM reconstruction, imposing strict icosahedral symmetry averaging during the reconstruction process attenuated the signal of asymmetric or structurally heterogeneous features such as glycans due to their local variability. In order to overcome this issue, we used local symmetry expansion, followed by an established focused classification and orientation refinement approach to resolve these local glycan features more clearly. In this method, the particle stack from the final 3D refinement of SVV-ANTXR1 was symmetry-expanded [49], thus creating a stack containing symmetry related copies [50]. Then, we applied a soft-edged mask to cover one asymmetric unit of the reconstruction plus a distance of 12 pixels extended in all directions (Figure 1A). Initial 3D classification of the data set did not recognize any distinct structural heterogeneity and had similar features (Figure 1B), which led us to refine the entire data set to obtain the final cryo-EM map of the SVV-ANTXR1 asymmetric unit at 6.6 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 1C).",
                        "In agreement with our glycopeptide profiling, we observed two glycosylation sites at N166 and N184 in the extracellular vWA domain of ANTXR1 (Figure 1D,E). We could observe and fit the coordinates corresponding to a complex glycan profile, starting from the N-link up to its first bisection, a composition common to all of the glycans detected by LC-nSI-MS/MS analysis (red-dashed box, Table 1). Features in the cryo-EM electron potential map corresponding to N166 appeared to be better resolved compared to map detail at the N184 site as evident from the appearance of glycan branching at a lower threshold (contour level of 4 \u03c3 vs 3.4 \u03c3 above average). This suggested a higher degree of order within the glycans at N166 in comparison to N184, as shown by the MS analysis. In picornavirus receptors, N-linked glycans are not involved in direct interactions with the capsid, except in the case of interactions between \u03b1V\u03b26 and FMDV, where N266 linked glycan was shown to extend to the capsid surface, presumably bridging the integrin to the virus surface [37]. ANTXR1 vWA adopts a similar \u201cRossman fold\u201d to that of \u03b1V\u03b26 and interacts with the surface-exposed loops in VP1-VP3, reminiscent of FMDV- \u03b1V\u03b26 interactions. However, both N-linked glycans in the ANTXR1 vWA domain extend parallel to the capsid floor. Thus, neither N-linked glycan at N166 nor N184 was in close proximity to SVV surface-exposed loops, excluding a direct role of these glycans in mediating virus contact."

Visualization of SVV-GFP infected H446wt cells by fluorescence microscopy revealed that when SVV-GFP is pre-incubated with ANTXR1-Fc, all of the receptor binding sites on the SVV capsid become saturated, ergo blocking viral entry into cells. However, in the presence of PNGase F-treated ANTXR1-Fc, SVV is internalized into H446wt cells, clearly demonstrating loss of interaction with deglycosylated ANTXR1-Fc. In two control groups, we either treated H446wt cells with SVV-GFP alone or SVV-GFP incubated with PNGase F. Virus internalization was visible in both control groups and eliminates issues related to virus infectivity or H446wt receptor deglycosylation by partially inactivated PNGase F. We also performed co-immunoprecipation assays to examine the effect of PNGase treatment of ANTXR1-Fc (Figure 2B). We found that exposure of ANTXR1-Fc with PNGase F for 4 h induced a significant change in the molecular weight of ANTXR1-Fc due to deglycosylation. Additionally, we observed a time-dependent decrease in the amount of SVV protein bound to the PNGase F-treated ANTXR1-Fc. Alternatively, H446wt cells were directly incubated with PNGase F for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C prior to infection with 10\u22125 dilution of the SVV stock. Plaque formation assays (PFA) confirmed no visual plaques on PNGase F-treated cells compared to non-treated cells (Figure 2C). Even more, cryo-EM experiments aiming to observe SVV capsids decorated with deglycosylated ANTXR1 did not show any density corresponding to receptors (data not shown), suggesting that ANTXR1 adopts a different conformation incapable of binding with the SVV capsid. Collectively, these results show that ANTXR1 glycosylation is important for successful SVV attachment and entry."

                "Glycosylation in viral proteins or their receptors is a highly regulated posttranslational modification affecting their tertiary structure, function, stability, and downstream cellular signaling pathways. Viral protein or receptor glycosylation can generally be broadly categorized into two main groups: N-linked and O-linked. In N-linked glycosylation, glycans are attached to the asparagine residue in an Asp-X-Ser/Thr sequon, where X can be any amino acid except for proline. In O-linked glycosylation, the sugar moiety is attached to the oxygen atom of a serine or threonine residue. Viral protein glycosylation has been reported for enveloped viruses such as coronavirus spike protein [51], ebola virus glycoprotein [52], hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza virus [53], envelope glycoproteins of flaviviruses [54,55], and Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein [56]. Although multiple roles have been suggested for glycosylation with respect to viral pathogenesis, immune evasion by heavy glycan shielding or using shed/secreted glycoproteins remains the primary role [57]. Second to this role, glycans in viral envelope proteins act as attachment factors [57,58]. Alternatively, for non-enveloped viruses such as adenoviruses [59], rotaviruses [60], reoviruses [61], and picornaviruses [23,62], this mechanism reverses to utilize cell surface sialic acid/poly-sialic acid or glycans on cellular receptors as attachment factors.",
                "In picornaviruses, the usage of sialic acid as an attachment factor has been reported for members in the genus Enterovirus such as CVA24v, EV68, EV70, and EV71 [23,62]. Glycosylation sites observed in picornavirus receptors describe a rich geometry (Figure 3). For instance, N-linked glycans in \u03b1V\u03b26 integrin form additional contacts between the receptor and surface-exposed loops of FMDV capsid proteins [37]. Interestingly, heavy N-linked glycosylation in CD155 abrogates poliovirus infectivity [38], a testament to plausible steric hindrance by surrounding glycans when the receptor needs to reach the capsid floor to complete its interaction with the capsid, as opposed to forming contacts with surface-exposed loops. Hence, picornaviruses are a group of viruses in which receptor glycosylation can be expressed as a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d, rather than an exclusively beneficial receptor modification favoring viral entry in every case.",
                "To further our knowledge of the functional role of receptor glycosylation in picornaviruses, we investigated the glycosylation in the SVV receptor, ANTXR1. In agreement with previous literature, our 18O labeling experiment in conjunction with LC-MS analysis revealed two glycosylation sites at N166 and N184 in the extracellular vWA domain of ANTXR1 and one glycosylation site at N81 located in the fused Fc domain. N-glycosylation in ANTXR1 has also been shown to be essential for protein folding, stability, trafficking, and ligand binding [39]. This pattern of N-glycosylation in ANTXR1 is also observed in ANTXR2, albeit less dependent on its functional roles. The presence of N-glycans in the vWA domain in ANTXR1 was visible in its complexed state with SVV. Symmetry expanded reconstruction of the SVV-ANTXR1 asymmetric unit confirmed the presence of two N-glycosylation sites in the vWA domain, which extended parallel to the SVV capsid surface, therein demonstrating no contacts with surfaced-exposed loops. Despite the absence of any interactions between ANTXR1 glycans and SVV capsid, ANTXR1 deglycosylation was able to abrogate viral entry into the small-cell lung cancer cell line H446wt, highlighting its stringent effect on receptor function. While the effect of N-glycosylation on the conformational stability of ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 has not been extensively investigated, it has been shown that N-glycosylation is essential for conformational stability in extended open conformation of integrins [63]. The same observation presumably holds true for ANTXR1, ligand binding open conformation, which closely resembles the integrin open state. This could explain the complete loss of interactions, subsequent viral entry, and infection when ANTXR1 is deglycosylated by PNGase F.",
                "Our results immediately suggest two important therapeutic applications: (1) As a biomarker for screening for patients with glycosylated receptors in tumors, as we have shown that glycosylation is essential for SVV binding, entry and subsequent infection. (2) The specific role of ANTXR1 in swine remains unknown and this eliminates the possibility of using enzymatic cleavage of ANTXR1 glycans. Nonetheless, as shown with other viruses such as influenza and HIV, broad spectrum lectins can be directed against heavily fucosylated and sialylated glycans in ANTXR1 with the overarching goal of triggering a steric hindrance in the vicinity of the SVV binding site."
