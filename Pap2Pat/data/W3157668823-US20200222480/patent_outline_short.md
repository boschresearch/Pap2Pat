### Example 2: Genome-Wide Loss-of-Function Screens Identify ANTXR1 as Essential for SVV Infection

- identify ANTXR1 as essential for SVV infection

### Example 3: ANTXR1 is Necessary for Permissively in Neuroendocrine Cancer Cell Lines

- confirm loss of SVV permissivity in ANTXR1 KO clones

### Example 4: Defects in Innate Immune Signaling are Required for SVV Replication

- determine ANTXR1 expression level in cell lines
- identify down-regulation of interferon signaling genes in permissive cell lines

### Example 5: Re-Expression of ANTXR1 Rescues SVV Permissivity

- confirm rescue of SVV permissivity in ANTXR1 KO cells

### Example 6: Ectopic Expression of ANTXR1 is Sufficient to Induce SVV Permissivity

- induce SVV permissivity in non-permissive SCLC cell lines

### Example 7: ANTXR1 Interacts Directly with SVV

- demonstrate direct interaction between ANTXR1 and SVV

### Example 8: Soluble ANTXR1-Fc Chimera Blocks SVV Infection In Vitro

- block SVV infection with soluble ANTXR1-Fc chimera

### Example 9: Loss of ANTXR1 Protein Expression Abrogates SVV Binding to Permissive Cells

- demonstrate loss of SVV binding in ANTXR1 KO cells
- show TEX2 KO cells retain SVV binding ability
