                        "Seneca Valley Virus (SVV), a recently discovered oncolytic picornavirus, selectively infects cancers with neuroendocrine features, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and pediatric neuroendocrine solid tumors. These cancers constitute a major cause of morbidity and mortality\u2014SCLC alone is responsible for approximately 30,000 deaths annually in the US Relative to other oncolytic viruses in clinical evaluation, SVV is notable for its small size, exceptionally rapid doubling time, high selectivity for neuroendocrine cancer cells, and the absence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies in patients. Previous studies in multiple pre-clinical mouse models confirmed the ability of SVV to home to tumor through the vasculature, resulting in potent anti-cancer efficacy. Phase I clinical trials testing SVV as a virotherapy in patients with neuroendocrine cancers, including SCLC, showed high levels of sustained viral replication in SCLC patients, even after the production of neutralizing antibodies to SVV, and confirmed the ability of SVV to selectively infect cancer cells after intravenous administration. Clinical development of this agent has been hampered relative to that of other oncolytic viruses by a lack of understanding of cellular determinants of infection for this new virus, most notably including identification of the cellular receptor for SVV.",
                        "Defining determinants of SVV permissivity, including identification of the viral receptor, would substantially facilitate clinical development by focusing on patients who could ultimately benefit from SVV virotherapy. The present application discloses anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) protein as the receptor for SVV utilizing two complementary genome-wide loss-of-function screens. ANTXR1 interacts directly and specifically with SVV. This interaction is required for SVV binding to permissive cells, and ANTXR1 expression is essential for SVV infection. The present application defines a clinically tractable predictive biomarker of SVV permissivity, and identifies ANTXR1 as the high-affinity cellular receptor for SVV in neuroendocrine cancers."

                                "The ANTXR1 functions as one of the two receptors for the Bacillus anthracis toxin. SVV is unique among known viruses in using ANTXR1, or any related protein, as a primary receptor. In contrast to a number of previously identified receptors of other picornaviruses, ANTXR1 is not a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) of receptors. Although ANTXR1 shares common features to the IgSF receptors in being a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein, it may be unique in its role as a receptor to both a mammalian virus and a bacterial toxin.",
                                "As disclosed herein, ANTXR1 is frequently expressed on the surface of tumor cells compared to normal cells. Efforts to develop a therapeutic antibody targeting ANTXR1 expressed in tumor endothelium have been hampered by cross-reactivity of the antibody to ANTXR2. The exquisite selectivity of SVV for ANTXR1 and the medium resolution cryo-EM structure described herein will enable future therapeutic development in the antibody space for both anti-angiogenic purposes and a potentially novel target for select neuroendocrine cancers. The gene expression data herein that beyond expression of ANTXR1, cancer cell defects in the innate immune response are important determinants of successful SVV replication. This feature is not unique to SVV and may be a shared requirement for success of many oncolytic viruses. Defects in innate immune response pathways are common in cancers; SCLC in particular has been shown to frequently lack key components of MHC class I antigen presentation as well as decreased expression of immune stimulatory cytokines. Both result in decreased tumor cell recognition and removal by the immune system. These features, together with ANTXR1 expression, can define a category of cancers particularly amenable to treatment with SVV. An improved understanding of how cellular innate immune response pathways dictate permissivity can identify synergistic combination strategies with therapeutic agents targeting these pathways in cancer cells.",
                                "For SVV, ANTXR1 expression can serve as a predictive biomarker for future clinical development, facilitating the identification of patients most likely to benefit from SVV virotherapy. Predictive biomarkers to guide future clinical trials is a particularly acute need for patients with SCLC. This is a highly aggressive and nearly universally lethal cancer, for which few tractable therapeutic targets have been identified. Many large scale clinical trials, conducted without biomarker selection, have failed to advance the standard of care for this disease. Carefully defined markers that would focus novel therapeutic studies on the responsive subset of patients could change this field. The identification of ANTXR1, and possibly suppressed innate immunity, as selection criteria will help define the structure of our subsequent clinical trials.",

                                "Detection of expression of ANTXR1 or other biomarkers may be carried out at the transcription level or translation level using any methodology suitable for identifying an infectious agent-associated biomarker, including but not limited to immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, HPLC, FPLC, mass spectrometry (MS), protein sequencing, antibody array, RTPCR, quantitative RTPCR, nucleotide sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray and combinations thereof.",
                                "In some embodiments, the expression of ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers is detected by immunohistochemistry. Briefly, a biopsy sample from a subject is contacted with an antibody that specifically binds to ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers. After incubating the sample with antibodies, the sample is washed and the antibody-biomarker complex formed can be detected. This can be accomplished by incubating the washed sample with a detection reagent. This detection reagent may be a second antibody which is labeled with a detectable label, for example. Exemplary detectable labels include magnetic beads (e.g., DYNABEADS\u2122), fluorescent dyes, radiolabels, enzymes (for example, horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic beads.",
                                "In certain embodiments, ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers are detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which is typically carried out using antibody coated assay plate or wells. Commonly used ELISA assay employs either a sandwich immunoassay or a competitive binding immunoassay.",
                                "A sandwich ELISA may be used to capture, detect, characterize and quantify tissue cells from small quantities of tumor biopsy samples. A sandwich ELISA employs two antibodies, which bind to different sites on the antigen or ligand. The primary antibody, which is highly specific for the antigen, is attached to a solid surface. The antigen is then added followed by addition of a second antibody referred to as the detection antibody. The detection antibody binds the antigen to a different epitope than the primary antibody. Each of these antibodies may be directed to a different marker epitope on the same or different proteins, whereby the primary antibody captures the protein therefrom via the first protein and the detection antibody facilitates quantitation of a protein bound thereto. As a result, the protein therefrom is \u201csandwiched\u201d between the two antibodies.",
                                "The binding affinity for the antigen (via antibodies) is usually the main determinant of immunoassay sensitivity. As the antigen concentration increases the amount of binding agent bound increases leading to a higher measured response. The standard curve of a sandwich-binding assay has a positive slope. To quantify the extent of binding different reporters can be used. Typically an enzyme is attached to the secondary antibody which must be generated in a different species than primary antibodies (i.e., if the primary antibody is a rabbit antibody than the secondary antibody would be an anti-rabbit from goat, chicken, etc., but not rabbit). The substrate for the enzyme is added to the reaction that forms a colorimetric readout as the detection signal. The signal generated is proportional to the amount of target antigen present in the sample. The antibody linked reporter used to measure the binding event determines the detection mode. A spectrophotometric plate reader may be used for colorimetric detection. Several types of reporters have been developed in order to increase sensitivity in an immunoassay. For example, chemiluminescent substrates have been developed which further amplify the signal and can be read on a luminescent plate reader. Also, a fluorescent readout may be obtained where the enzyme step of the assay is replaced with a fluorophore tagged antibody. This readout is then measured using a fluorescent plate reader.",
                                "In some embodiments, the antibody is attached to a solid support to facilitate washing and subsequent isolation of the antigen-antibody complex, prior to contacting the antibody with a sample. Examples of solid supports include glass or plastic in the form of a microtiter plate, a stick, a bead, or a microbead. Examples of solid supports encompassed herein include those formed partially or entirely of glass (e.g., controlled pore glass), polysaccharides (e.g., agarose), polyacrylamides, silicones, and plastics such as polystyrene, polypropylene and polyvinyl alcohol.",
                                "In some embodiments, ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers are detected using an antibody microarray panel containing immobilized ANTXR1-specific and/or other biomarkers-specific antibodies on a substrate surface. The microarray can be used in a \u201csandwich\u201d assay in which the antibody on the microarray captures ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers in the test sample and the captured marker is detected by a labeled secondary antibody that specifically binds to the captured marker. In a preferred embodiment, the secondary antibody is biotinylated or enzyme-labeled. The detection is achieved by subsequent incubation with a streptavidin-fluorophore conjugate (for fluorescence detection) or an enzyme substrate (for colorimetric detection).",
                                "In another embodiment, the antibody microarray provides a competitive immunoassay. Briefly, a microarray comprising immobilized anti-marker antibodies is incubated with a test sample in the presence of a labeled ANTXR1 and/or other biomarker standard. The labeled ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers compete with the unlabeled ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers in the test sample for the binding to the immobilized antigen-specific antibody. In such a competitive setting, an increased concentration of ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers in the test sample would lead to a decreased binding of the labeled ANTXR1 and/or other biomarker standard to the immobilized antibody and hence a reduced signal intensity from the label.",
                                "In certain embodiments, ANTXR1 and/or other biomarkers are detected using an oligonucleotide microarray for detecting and quantitating mRNA expression level(s). An oligonucleotide microarray consists of an arrayed series of a plurality of microscopic spots of oligonucleotides, called features, each containing a small amount (typically in the range of picomoles) of a specific oligonucleotide sequence. The specific oligonucleotide sequence can be a short section of a gene or other oligonucleotide element that is used as a probe to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA sample under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by fluorescence-based detection of fluorophore-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target. The oligonucleotide probes are typically attached to a solid surface by a covalent bond to a chemical matrix (via epoxy-silane, amino-silane, lysine, polyacrylamide or others). The solid surface can be glass or a silicon chip or microscopic beads. Oligonucleotide arrays are different from other types of microarray only in that they either measure nucleotides or use oligonucleotide as part of its detection system.",
                                "A microarray panel can be processed in manual, semi-automatic or automatic modes. Manual mode refers to manual operations for all assay steps including reagent and sample delivery onto microarrays, sample incubation and microarray washing. Semi-automatic modes refer to manual operation for sample and reagent delivery onto microarray, while incubation and washing steps operate automatically. In an automatic mode, three steps (sample/reagent delivery, incubation and washing) can be controlled by a computer or an integrated breadboard unit with a keypad. For example, the microarray can be processed with a ProteinArray Workstation (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.) or Assay 1200\u2122. Workstation (Zyomyx, Hayward, Calif.). Scanners by fluorescence, colorimetric and chemiluminescence, can be used to detect microarray signals and capture microarray images. Quantitation of microarray-based assays can also be achieved by other means, such as mass spectrometry and surface plasma resonance. Captured microarray images can be analyzed by stand-alone image analysis software or with image acquisition and analysis software package. For example, quantification of an antigen microarray can be achieved with a fluorescent PMT-based scanner\u2014ScanArray 3000 (General Scanning, Watertown, Mass.) or colorimetric CCD-based scanner\u2014VisionSpot (Allied Biotech, Ijamsville, Md.). Typically, the image analysis would include data acquisition and preparation of assay report with separate software packages. To speed up the whole assay process from capturing an image to generating an assay report, all the analytical steps including image capture, image analysis, and report generation, can be confined in and/or controlled by one software package. Such an unified control system would provide the image analysis and the generation of assay report in a user-friendly manner."

Methods that utilize SW for cancer therapy include systemic, regional or local delivery of the virus at safe, developable, and tolerable doses to elicit therapeutically useful destruction of tumor cells. Even following systemic administration, the therapeutic index for SVV is at least 10, preferably at least 100 or more preferably at least 1000. In general, SVV is administered in an amount of between 107 and 1\u00d71011 vp/kg. The exact dosage to be administered is dependent upon a variety of factors including the age, weight, and sex of the patient, and the size and severity of the tumor being treated. The viruses may be administered one or more times, which may be dependent upon the immune response potential of the host. Single or multiple administrations of the compositions can be carried out with dose levels and pattern being selected by the treating physician. If necessary, the immune response may be diminished by employing a variety of immunosuppressants, so as to permit repetitive administration and/or enhance replication by reducing the immune response to the viruses. Anti-cancer viral therapy may be combined with other anti-cancer protocols. Delivery can be achieved in a variety of ways, employing liposomes, direct injection, catheters, topical application, inhalation, intravenous delivery, etc. Further, a DNA copy of the SVV genomic RNA, or portions thereof, can also be a method of delivery, where the DNA is subsequently transcribed by cells to produce SVV virus particles or particular SVV polypeptides.",

A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the virus that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a patient. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of viruses can be determined by standard procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population of animals or cells; for viruses, the dose is in units of vp/kg) and the ED50(the dose\u2014vp/kg\u2014therapeutically effective in 50% of the population of animals or cells) or the EC50 (the effective concentration\u2014vp/cell (see Table 1 for example)\u2014in 50% of the population of animals or cells). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50 or EC50. Viruses which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of viruses lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 or EC50 with little or no toxicity.

Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells. Science 343, 84-87 (2014); Sanjana, N. E., Shalem, O. & Zhang, F., Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening.

Due to the high efficiency of gene disruption in haploid cells, we performed a GeCKO screen in one of the only known human haploid cell lines, the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line HAP1, which we found to be permissive to SVV at relatively high MOI (Carette, J. E., et al. Ebola virus entry requires the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1. Nature 477, 340-343 (2011)). HAP1-Cas9 cells were transduced by the pooled GeCKO library lentivirus and challenged with an SVV infection at a high MOI to select for resistant cells (FIG. 1, panel a). Genomic DNA was extracted from the expanded surviving cell population and subsequently analyzed by high-throughput sequencing to determine changes in sgRNA representation compared to controls. Representation of non-targeting control sgRNAs was maintained from the plasmid pools until the end of the screen; however, notable changes were observed in targeting sgRNAs, reflecting loss of sgRNAs that target essential genes. The most significantly enriched sgRNAs in the SVV selected pool were found to target the ANTXR1 gene, which encodes the anthrax toxin receptor 1 (Bradley, K. A., Mogridge, J., Mourez, M., Collier, R. J. & Young, J. A. Identification of the cellular receptor for anthrax toxin. Nature 414, 225-229 (2001)). ANTXR1 and the testis expressed 2 gene, TEX2 were the only genes with multiple sgRNAs significantly enriched in the SVV resistant sample (FIG. 1, panel b). Highly enriched sgRNAs were individually tested for the ability to confer resistance to SVV to HAP1 cells (FIG. 1, panel c). 6 sgRNAs were observed targeting 3 different genes that conferred SVV resistance after gene knockout in HAP 1 cells, including three separate sgRNAs targeting the ANTXR1 gene. Both enriched sgRNAs targeting the TEX2 gene conferred resistance as well as 1 sgRNA targeting the NR2C2 gene.",
                                "To confirm the results in a cell line of immediate relevance to neuroendocrine cancers, the GeCKO screen was repeated in the highly SVV-permissive H446 SCLC cell line. GeCKO lentivirus transduced H446-Cas9 cells were challenged with SVV at an MOI of 1 vp/cell. The percentage of surviving cells after SVV infection was much lower than in the HAP1 screen, allowing isolation of individual cell colonies, instead of a pooled population. Genomic DNA from each colony was extracted and individual sgRNAs were identified by Sanger sequencing (FIG. 1, panel d). In 23 of 25 resistant colonies (92%) sgRNAs targeting ANTXR1 were present, and comprised three independent sgRNAs targeting ANTXR1. Each sgRNA identified in the H446 screen was tested individually in a secondary screen of parental H446 cells for the ability to confer SVV resistance (FIG. 1, panel e). All three ANTXR1-targeting sgRNAs identified in the screen were able to confer resistance to SVV; however, no other candidate sgRNAs altered SVV permissivity in parental H446 cells."

These indels would lead to a frame shift mutation and premature stop codon, predicted to result in a truncated ANTXR1 protein (FIG. 2, panel a). The loss of SVV permissivity of the ANTXR1 KO clones was confirmed using a cell viability assay with parental H446 cells and non-permissive A549 cells as positive and negative controls, respectively (FIG. 2, panel b). After a 72 h incubation period with SVV, a significant loss of viability was observed with increasing MOI of SVV in parental H446 cells. Indicative of highly SVV resistant cells, all ANTXR1 KO lines as well as A549 cells showed no significant change in cell viability with MOI of SVV over 5 logs higher than effective exposures for parental H446 cells.",
                                "To determine whether ANTXR1 is essential for SVV infection in additional neuroendocrine cancer cell lines, we generated ANTXR1 KO lines in the SCLC cell lines H446, LX22cl, and H82, as well as HAP1 and the SVV-permissive pediatric cancer cell lines Y79 and TC-71. Each ANTXR1 KO line was challenged with an infectious SVV reporter virus that expresses GFP within the viral polyprotein (SVV-GFP) (Poirier, J. T., et al. Selective tropism of Seneca Valley virus for variant subtype small cell lung cancer. J Natl Cancer Inst 105, 1059-1065 (2013); Poirier, J. T., et al. Characterization of a full-length infectious cDNA clone and a GFP reporter derivative of the oncolytic picornavirus SVV-001. J Gen Virol 93, 2606-2613 (2012)). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the corresponding parental cell line as a positive control (FIG. 2, panel c). As a negative control, we created an H446 cell line stably expressing an sgRNA targeting EGFP, to confirm loss of permissivity was due to the targeting ANTXR1 sgRNAs and not off-target effects. In all cases ANTXR1 KO profoundly decreased SVV-GFP infection?70% in the KO cell lines compared to the corresponding parental lines. ANTXR1 gene knockout leads to a loss of SVV permissivity in permissive cell lines of multiple tumor types.",
                                "Bystander cells lacking ANTXR1 expression were further examined to if they could be infected by neighboring cells through cell-cell spread in a mixed cell population containing both parental and ANTXR1 KO cells. First, an H446 ANTXR1 KO clone was created that stably expressed the mCherry fluorescent protein (ANTXR1 KO mCherry). Then, parental H446 and ANTXR1 KO mCherry cells were co-cultured at a 1:1 cell number ratio and the cells were challenged with SVV-GFP using pure parental and ANTXR1 KO mCherry cultures as controls (FIG. 2, panel d). As expected, only single GFP positive (GFP+) or mCherry positive (mCherry+) cells were observed but did not identify GFP+/mCherry+ cells in the admixed cell culture. Additionally, the above experiment was repeated in vivo with WT SVV-001 by engrafting immunodeficient nude mice with parental H446 cells, ANTXR1 KO mCherry cells, or a 1:1 mixture of parental and ANTXR1 KO mCherry cells (FIG. 2, panel e). Parental H446 tumors showed complete regressions upon administration of SVV-001 whereas the 1:1 parental:ANTXR1 KO mCherry tumor cohort showed only an initial delay in tumor progression. Furthermore, the resulting tumors that eventually progressed in the 1:1 parental:ANTXR1 KO mCherry SVV-001 cohort were significantly enriched in mCherry+ cells, indicating a loss of parental H446 cells (FIG. 2, panel f). As expected, ANTXR1 KO mCherry tumors were unaffected by the administration of SVV-001 compared to control."

                                "Whether ANTXR1 expression level in cell lines is predictive of permissivity was determined using publicly available gene expression data of the 1,037 cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (Barretina, J., et al. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity. Nature 483, 603-607 (2012)). First, an expression cutoff was determined based on the distribution of expression in the CCLE (Zilliox, M. J. & Irizarry, R. A. A gene expression bar code for microarray data. Nature methods 4, 911-913 (2007)). Approximately 37% of cell lines fell below the expression cutoff (FIG. 3, panel a). Of the cell lines in the CCLE, 81 have been previously assessed for permissivity. Of these lines, biased toward inclusion of neuroendocrine cancer lines, 20 were found to be permissive. ANTXR1 expression was significantly associated with permissivity (p=0.0023, Fisher's exact test). Most strikingly, none of the 20 permissive cell lines lacked expression of ANTXR1, supporting the hypothesis that ANTXR1 is a required host factor for SVV infection.",
                                "While ANTXR1 expression appears to be a requirement for SVV permissivity, the CCLE dataset suggests that it is not sufficient: 42/62 (67.7%) of ANTXR1-expressing cell lines analyzed for permissivity were reported to be non-permissive. Meaningful gene expression differences between ANTXR1-expressing permissive and non-permissive classes were identified. Competitive gene set enrichment was used to identify significantly differentially expressed gene sets from the Reactome database (Milacic, M., et al. Annotating cancer variants and anti-cancer therapeutics in reactome. Cancers 4, 1180-1211 (2012); Croft, D., et al. The Reactome pathway knowledgebase. Nucleic Acids Res 42, D472-477 (2014)). 7 gene sets were identified, all of which were significantly down-regulated in permissive cell lines expressing ANTXR1. The most significant gene set was INTERFERON_ALPHA_BETA_SIGNALING, in which 34/44 (77%) of genes were significantly down-regulated in permissive cell lines. The enrichment for this gene set (q=0.0046) can be visualized in FIG. 3, panel b. A sample-wise analysis of gene expression was performed to see whether the gene set enrichment we observed was driven by cell lines derived from a particular tumor histology. Lack of expression of these gene sets was found enriched among SCLC and neuroblastoma cell lines (FIG. 3, panel c). To determine whether this expression signature was operant in vivo, a similar analysis of human tumor xenograft data from the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) was performed and permissivity to SVV was found concordant with down-regulation of interferon signaling at baseline (Morton, C. L., et al. Initial testing of the replication competent Seneca Valley virus (NTX-010) by the pediatric preclinical testing program. Pediatric Blood Cancer 55, 295-303 (2010); Neale, G., et al. Molecular characterization of the pediatric preclinical testing panel. Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 14, 4572-4583 (2008)). Taken together, these results suggest that robust permissivity to SVV requires both expression of the cellular receptor ANTXR1 and down-regulation of expression of antiviral IFN signaling genes at baseline.",
                                "IFN pathway activity within ANTXR1-expressing cell lines was assessed. It was hypothesized that highly SVV permissive cells have significantly down-regulated IFN response pathways and therefore may not respond to exogenous IFN pathway activation. The ability of exogenous IFN\u03b2 to decrease SVV permissivity in the highly permissive SCLC cell lines H446 and H82 was tested, as well as SVV refractory H1618 cells (FIG. 3, panel d). Relative permissivity of each cell line correlated strongly with the degree to which exogenous IFN\u03b2 could limit SVV infection. Previous studies have shown that permissivity to other oncolytic viruses could be increased due to indirect IFN pathway repression by pre-treating cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as SAHA (vorinostat) or MS-275 (Nguyen, T. L., et al. Chemical targeting of the innate antiviral response by histone deacetylase inhibitors renders refractory cancers sensitive to viral oncolysis. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105, 14981-14986 (2008)). The ANTXR1-expressing non-permissive SCLC cell lines, H1618 and DMS79, were pre-treated with SAHA or MS-275 prior to challenging them with SVV-GFP and subsequent analysis by flow cytometry (FIG. 3, panel e-f). Compared to untreated cells, a significant increase in GFP+ cells was observed after HDAC treatment in both cell lines. Conversely, upon activation of the IFN pathways by pre-treatment with exogenous IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2 and subsequent SVV-GFP challenge, there was a decrease in SVV permissive, or GFP+ cells, for both cell lines. Additionally, the decrease in SVV permissive cells could be partially restored by pre-treating cells with IFN\u03b1/3 and a corresponding IFN\u03b1/l monoclonal antibody that could block the IFN activity. These results confirm that SVV permissivity can be further dictated in ANTXR1-expressing cells by the expression of IFN response pathways. Additionally the activity of these pathways within the cell at the time of infection can alter SVV permissivity, but only in cells where the pathways are not significantly down-regulated."

We co-transfected three H446 ANTXR1 KO lines with an ANTXR1-HA expression plasmid and an mCherry fluorescent protein expression plasmid and challenged the cells with SVV-GFP 16 h post transfection (FIG. 4, panel a). Compared to untransfected ANTXR1 KO cells that did not show any GFP+ cells, ANTXR1 KO cells transfected with the ANTXR1-HA expression plasmid consistently showed GFP+ cells, indicative of a productive SVV-GFP infection and rescue of SVV permissivity. To further test the importance of ANTXR1 expression in permissive cells, we co-transfected the H446 and LX22cl ANTXR1 KO lines with the ANTXR1-HA and mCherry expression plasmids, and subsequently incubated the cells with SVV-GFP. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and gated to select for transfected cells (mCherry+). Compared to parental mCherry+/GFP+ cells, we observed a significant decrease in the mCherry+/GFP+ population in ANTXR1 KO H446 and LX22cl cells that was rescued upon transfection with the ANTXR1-HA expression plasmid (FIG. 4, panel b). Expression of the ANTXR1-HA fusion protein was confirmed in each ANTXR1-HA transfected cell line by immunoblot using an HA tag specific antibody. Re-expression of ANTXR1 protein in ANTXR1 KO cell lines is sufficient to rescue SVV permissivity."

                                "As ANTXR1 is a transmembrane protein and required for SVV infection in various permissive SCLC cell lines, it was determined whether ANTXR1 interacts directly with SVV. An ANTXR1-Fc chimera or a control isotype IgG1 Fc protein was utilized for co-immunoprecipitation studies. After incubating Fc-bead complexes with SVV, all bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by Western blot using SVV rabbit antisera (FIG. 5, panel a). In all serially diluted ANTXR1-Fc samples incubated with SVV, viral protein bands were observed as well as a decrease in intensity of the bands corresponding to a decrease of bound ANTXR1-Fc protein. Any SVV protein bands were not detected in samples incubated with the IgG1 Fc isotype control or samples not incubated with SVV. After confirming a direct interaction, the ANTXR1-Fc chimera co-immunoprecipitation studies were repeated in the presence of increasing amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) to investigate the strength of the interaction in vitro under high ionic strength (FIG. 5, panel b). The intensity of viral protein bands did not change significantly with increasing salt concentration up to 2M NaCl. As ANTXR1 has high sequence similarity to the high-affinity anthrax receptor, ANTXR2, the co-immunoprecipitation was performed with the ANTXR2-Fc chimeric protein using the ANTXR1-Fc protein as a positive control (Bradley, K. A., Mogridge, J., Mourez, M., Collier, R. J. & Young, J. A. Identification of the cellular receptor for anthrax toxin. Nature 414, 225-229 (2001)). Any bands were not observed corresponding to viral proteins in ANTXR2-Fc samples incubated with SVV, indicating the absence of an interaction between the extracellular domain of ANTXR2 and SVV (FIG. 5, panel c). Bands corresponding to viral protein were observed only in ANTXR1-Fc samples. These results indicate that ANTXR1, and not ANTXR2, can directly interact with SVV in a high affinity and stable interaction.",
                                "Additionally it was investigated which region of the ANTXR1 extracellular domain was essential for the interaction with SVV and was therefore, essential for rescue of SVV permissivity in ANTXR1 KO cells. An N-terminal deletion series of ANTXR1-HA expression plasmids was created that deleted increasing regions of the extracellular domain sequence of the ANTXR1 protein while preserving the signal peptide sequence. The ability of the truncated expression plasmids to rescue SVV permissivity in one of the H446 ANTXR1 KO clones was then tested. Unlike full-length ANTXR1 protein, all ANTXR1 truncations were unable to rescue SVV permissivity when challenged with SVV-GFP. Full-length and truncated ANTXR1-HA protein expression was confirmed via Western blot. These results suggest there are required residues for the interaction of SVV and ANTXR1 located in the most N-terminal region of the ANTXR1 protein."

Parental H446 incubated with SVV-Cy5 showed a high level of fluorescence (mean fluorescence (MF)=2,373) compared to DMS114 cells incubated with SVV-Cy5 (MF=425). TEX2 KO H446 cells showed a similar fluorescence profile to parental H446 cells (MF=2,233), indicating there was no loss of SVV binding ability corresponding to loss of TEX2 protein expression. In contrast, ANTXR1 KO H446 cells showed a markedly diminished fluorescence profile similar to the negative control line, DMS114 (MF=358).

Picornaviruses have an icosahedral capsid formed by 60 copies of a protomer consisting of three major capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 and a fourth much smaller protein, VP4 positioned in the interior of the capsid. Copies of VP1 are assembled around the five-fold axis, while VP2 and VP3 alternate around the three-fold axis (Tuthill, T. J., Groppelli, E., Hogle, J. M. & Rowlands, D. J. Picornaviruses. Current topics in microbiology and immunology 343, 43-89 (2010)). The reconstruction matches the existing atomic model of the virus (Venkataraman, S., et al.

Additionally, the map displays the receptor subdomains distributed radially around the five-fold axis, in crown-like geometry similar to other picornaviruses, such as poliovirus (Strauss, M., et al. Nectin-like interactions between poliovirus and its receptor trigger conformational changes associated with cell entry. Journal of virology 89, 4143-4157 (2015)), rhinovirus (Kolatkar, P. R., et al.
