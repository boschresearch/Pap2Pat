    "abstract": "Direct ink writing enables the layer-by-layer manufacture of ordered, porous structures whose mechanical behavior is driven by architecture and material properties. Here, we incorporate two different gas filled microsphere pore formers to evaluate the effect of shell stiffness and T g on compressive behavior and compression set in siloxane matrix printed structures. The lower T g microsphere structures exhibit substantial compression set when heated near and above T g , with full structural recovery upon reheating without constraint. By contrast, the higher T g microsphere structures exhibit reduced compression set with no recovery upon reheating. Aside from their role in tuning the mechanical behavior of direct ink write structures, polymer microspheres are good candidates for shape memory elastomers requiring structural complexity, with potential applications toward tandem shape memory polymers.",

                "The 3D printing process employed in this work, also known as direct ink writing (DIW), enables the layer-by-layer manufacture of ordered, porous structures whose mechanical behavior is driven by architecture and material properties. We pursue hierarchical porosity as a means of lightweighting, tailoring mechanical response and introducing functionality into 3D printed silicones. Hierarchical porosity is achieved by a combining printed structural porosity with intrastrand porosity, obtained by adding hollow, gas-filled microspheres to the ink. Aside from their role in tuning the mechanical behavior of 3D printed architectures, polymer microspheres are good candidates for shape memory applications requiring structural complexity with the ability to achieve both open or closed cell porosity. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that shape memory can be achieved in 3D printed porous elastomers simply by the addition of polymer microspheres with controlled shell glass transition temperatures.",
                "Process development and fabrication of stochastic elastomeric foams is driven by diverse applications requiring advanced structural performance facilitated by both closed cells (e.g., shock absorption, acoustic damping and thermal insulation) and open cells (e.g., biocompatible membranes, tissue engineering scaffolds, semipermeable membranes for materials separation and food processing)1\u20136. This application space has benefitted from structural control, enabled by a family of emerging technologies, broadly known as 3D printing. Recently, 3D printing of silicones has been used to create mechanical energy absorbing materials with negative stiffness7, vascularized tissue constructs8, stretchable sensors9, soft robotics10, and shape morphing materials11. These advances are made possible by the flexible and stretchable nature of silicone elastomers, combined with the unique structural and compositional control enabled via 3D printing.",
                "Applications benefitting from structurally engineered porosity accommodated by 3D printing include engineered tissue scaffolds12, photolithographic patterned nanowire growth for tailored electronics13, 14, and nanolithography metamaterials with a negative refractive index for cloaking and superlensing applications15, engineered with unit cells smaller than the wavelength of light16. In addition to their predictability, repeatability and potential for architectural complexity, ordered porous structures are desirable over stochastic foams from a long-term mechanical performance standpoint, due to their minimization of local stress concentrations which can result in localized material failure17.",
                "Further spatial and temporal control can be achieved by 3D printing with shape memory polymers18. Since their development, in the 1960\u2019s19, polymers with shape memory behavior20 have found applications in self-repairing components21, high performance textiles22, and surgical medicine23. More recent advancements in this field include shape memory polymers with elastomeric behavior at elevated temperatures24 and very large strain and energy storage capacities have been reported25\u201327.",
                "In the field of net-shape processing, shape memory behavior can provide enhanced tunability and functionality to 3D printed objects, enabling controlled structural deformation to occur post-processing. Imbuing 3D printed objects with the ability to change their configuration in response to external stimuli is colloquially known as \u201c4D printing\u201d, where the fourth dimension is time28.",
                "Our 3D printing approach enables property-specific tailoring, resulting in mechanical metamaterials that are tuned with constituent material behavior, porosity and structure7. Examples of 3D printed metamaterials can be found in ceramic29\u201331 and metallic32, 33 hierarchical lattice structures34 with mechanical behavior outside that of conventionally processed materials achieved through tuning levels of hierarchy, porosity and material constituents."

The former is influenced by the applied pressure, die geometry and rheological response of the resin, while the latter is a function of gel strength, deposition speed, shear rate and resin density36. Here, we pursue intrastrand porosity using a silicone based ink comprised of polymeric shell, gas filled microspheres or microballoons to further enhance the compressibility of porous elastomeric structures.

Under oscillatory flow at a frequency of 10\u2009Hz (Fig.\u00a02a), the effect of microballoon addition manifests as an increase in storage and loss moduli, accompanied by a slight increase in yield stress in the case of the Tg44 resin, while maintaining printability. No permanent die swell was observed through either measurement of printed strands or in situ measurement of flow near the die exit. This is attributable to power law behavior due to wall slip/plug flow (Fig.\u00a02b), indicating that no configurational entropy is recovered upon nozzle exit.Figure 2Effect of microballoons on (a) rotational oscillatory response, (b) continuous flow behavior of the ink, and (c) response to compressive loading of the cast and printed structures.",

                        "Gas filled microballoons provide a means of tuning the mechanical performance of 3D printed elastomers, beyond architecture; the lattice is limited by nozzle diameter, ink rheology and available extrusion pressure. To isolate the effect of structural porosity from intrastrand porosity, both bulk (cast) and printed structures were evaluated. In neat siloxane structures, printed in cross-ply (alternating 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 layered structures referred to as face-centered tetragonal or FCT38, Fig.\u00a01d\u2013g) and cast without microballoons, two regimes of compression response are observed. In the first regime (<40% \u03b5 in Fig.\u00a02c), deformation is architecturally driven, accommodated by compaction and inlaying of upper layers in layers below. In the subsequent regime, deformation is driven by the strand material properties. The transition between the two will be referred to as structural \u201clock up\u201d. This initial deformation mechanism of strand nestling in FCT printed structures has been investigated previously using in situ images acquired during compression loading and numerical simulations7.",
                        "Note that the inclusion of the Tg44 microballoons minimally affects the first regime of response, yet substantially lowers the material stiffness in the second regime (above 40% strain). This is attributed to the Tg44 microballoon compressibility, observed in cast resin filled with 40\u2009vol% Tg44 microballoons. The cast resin filled with 40\u2009vol% Tg113 microballoons is stiffer than the cast resin filled with 40\u2009vol% Tg44 microballoons, indicating that the Tg113 microballoons are stiffer than the Tg44 microballoons. The bulk siloxane resin experiences comparatively little strain under applied loading, while cast siloxane filled with 40\u2009vol% Tg113 and 40\u2009vol% Tg44 microballoons undergoes 9% and 27% strain, respectively, under the same applied load. These strains are accommodated primarily through a nonlinear response at 1000 kPa and 300 kPa, respectively, attributed to yielding or breakage of the microballoons.",
                        "In the case of specimens cast with Tg113 microballoons, we attribute the lower stiffness observed above 0.5\u2009MPa to fracture of the glassy microballoon shell. In printed structures filled with 40\u2009vol% Tg113 microballoons, we observe a stiffer material response early on, leading us to conclude that, at 40\u2009vol%, the glassy, rigid particles inhibit structural motion/strand nestling. This behavior is lessened in the 25\u2009vol% Tg113 printed structure, which exhibits greater deformation below 600 kPa. The strain accommodated during the first regime is reduced, in this case, from ~40% to 35%. For 25\u2009vol% and 40\u2009vol% loading Tg113, the stiffness of the material above the lock-up stress (point at which structural porosity becomes very small) in the microballoon filled print is comparable to that of the neat resin print. Conversely, recall that the lower stiffness Tg44 microballoons do not increase structural resistance to compression; in fact, they result in a lower stiffness response throughout loading beyond structural lock up or interlayer compaction. These results are presented to illustrate the effect of microballoon mechanical properties on open cell printed structures."

Percent recovery was determined as a ratio of the recovered thickness to the compressive deformation. Neat siloxane prints exhibited a small but measurable compression set at 40% and 60% strain when held at 70\u2009\u00b0C for 70\u2009h (Fig.\u00a03c). This thickness change was somewhat recoverable after reheating to 70\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The addition of Tg113 microballoons resulted in 20% reduction in thickness, following the same heating schedule at 40% and 60% strain. None of this deformation was recoverable after reheating to 70\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min.

Shape recovery of the 40\u2009vol% Tg44 microballoon prints is dependent on soak and reheat temperatures (Fig.\u00a03d). This effect is most pronounced at temperatures above the Tg of the microballoons. The shape recovery is evidenced by recovery of structural porosity and retention of microballoon spherical shape (Fig.\u00a03b)."

                "Elastomeric structures with shape memory behavior, accommodated by polymer shell microballoons were 3D printed and their influence on printability and structural performance was explored. Specifically, two different gas filled microballoons were selected to probe the effect of shell stiffness and Tg on compressive behavior and compression set in 3D printed structures. Introducing another level of porosity in the printed strands themselves enabled alteration of the mechanical response which was dependent on the microballoon shell stiffness. In the Tg44 system, we observe significant compression set at short holds at temperatures above Tg. While substantial recovery is observed at lower temperature reheats, complete structural recovery occurs upon reheating at elevated temperature (110\u2009\u00b0C). This is attributed to re-expansion of the microballoons when heated above Tg, with shape retention accommodated by the cross-linked structure. We observe reduced compression set in the higher Tg system, and a lack of recovery upon reheating. In this way, we illustrate the ability to tune structural response using a hierarchical combination of open and closed cell porosity, in conjunction with variable Tg microballoon addition. The shape memory behavior exhibited by the Tg44 microballoon filled prints demonstrates their potential use in wearable protective padding and cushions with Tg optimized for human body temperature, in shape memory polymer matrices toward the development of tandem shape memory polymers capable of recovery in stages depending on the temperature42, 43. Future efforts to advance this work include multi-material printing and in-line mixing, to further tune structure, porosity and material properties."
