                        "However, stochastic foams may not provide long-term mechanical performance because stochastic foams have a tendency to result in higher local stress concentrations which thereby result in localized material failure. It would be desirable to create ordered porous structures that are predictable, reproducible, and have potential for architectural complexity.",
                        "A three dimensional (3D) printing process, also known as direct ink writing (DIW), can form layer-by-layer manufacture of ordered, porous structures whose mechanical behavior is driven by architecture and material properties. Recently, 3D printing of silicones has been used to create mechanical energy absorbing materials with negative stiffness, vascularized tissue constructs, stretchable sensors, soft robotics, and shape morphing materials. These advances are made possible by the flexible and stretchable nature of silicone elastomers, combined with the unique structural and compositional control enabled via 3D printing.",
                        "Applications benefitting from structurally engineered porosity created by 3D printing include engineered tissue scaffolds, photolithographic patterned nanowire growth for tailored electronics, and nanolithography metamaterials with a negative refractive index for cloaking and superlensing applications, engineered with unit cells smaller than the wavelength of light.",
                        "Further spatial and temporal control can be achieved by 3D printing with shape memory polymers. Since their development, polymers with shape memory behavior have found applications in self-repairing components, high performance textiles, and surgical medicine. Recently, shape memory polymers with elastomeric behavior at elevated temperatures have shown promise with very large strain and energy storage capacities.",
                        "In the field of net-shape processing, it would be desirable to incorporate the enhanced tunability and functionality of shape memory behavior to 3D printed objects, thereby enabling controlled structural deformation to occur post-processing. Moreover, it would be desirable to imbue 3D printed objects with an additional dimension, such as time, wherein the 3D printed objects change their configuration in response to external stimuli."

As such, skilled artisans will understand the presently described inks to exhibit appropriate rheological properties to allow the formation of monolithic structures via deposition of multiple layers of the ink (or in some cases multiple inks with different compositions) in sequence.",
                        "The following description discloses several preferred structures formed via direct ink writing (DIW), extrusion freeform fabrication, or other equivalent techniques and therefore exhibit unique structural and compositional characteristics conveyed via the precise control allowed by such techniques.",

Various inventive concepts described herein achieve hierarchical porosity by combining printed structural porosity with intrastrand porosity by adding hollow, gas-filled microballoons to the ink used in the 3D printing.",
                        "Unlike conventional shape memory polymers (SMP), inventive concepts described herein form porous elastomeric structures with shape memory behavior. Conventional SMP are programmed about an optimal glass transition temperature (Tg) such that the SMP is heated above the Tg, programmed (e.g., folded, compressed, manipulated), then cooled to final shape.",
                        "As generally understood by one skilled in the art, the glass transition temperature of a material is a temperature, or range of temperatures, at which an amorphous material transitions from a hard, relatively brittle glassy state into a viscous or rubbery state as the temperature is increased. In some approaches, the glass transition temperature may be associated with amorphous regions within semi-crystalline material and as the temperature increases, these amorphous regions transition from a hard glassy state to a viscous material. Moreover, the glass transition temperature of a material tends to be lower than the melting temperature of the crystalline state of the material.",
                        "Crystallinity may be used as a fixing state in SMPs resulting in the materials of the SMPs being rigid. Moreover, in some cases, the final form of the SMP is a glassy state, e.g. a rigid, brittle glass. The mechanical properties of SMPs in a rigid, crystalline state or a glassy state are limited. It would be desirable to impart a shape memory change such that the materials are elastomeric while in the secondary shape.",
                        "Various inventive concepts described herein introduce Tg-specific polymer microballoons in which the component imparting the shape memory, e.g. the shell of the microballoon, may be a minority component of the composite but may affect the material properties of the composite structure in a significant and desired way. The different temperature specifications of the elastomeric matrix and the Tg-specific microballoons thereby may allow, at targeted temperatures, shape memory characteristics in an elastomeric material.",
                        "In various inventive concepts, elastomers may be embedded with gas-filled, polymer shell microballoons with low glass Tg to form composites with shape memory behavior. When compressed, folded, or otherwise manipulated during thermal soak at temperatures near or above the Tg of the microballoon, the composite may undergo deformation and experience compression set. Full shape recovery of the deformed composite may be achieved by re-heating the composite without mechanical loading or constraint above the Tg of the microballoon for a set time required for the microballoons to expand (due to gas expansion upon heating). Full shape recovery can be achieved in this way.",
                        "Various inventive concepts described herein show that aside from their role in tuning the mechanical behavior of 3D printed architectures, Tg-specific polymer microballoons may be good candidates for shape memory applications in porous materials requiring structural complexity with the ability to achieve open and/or closed cell porosity.",
                        "Various inventive concepts described herein demonstrate that shape memory may be achieved in 3D printed porous elastomers simply by the addition of polymer microballoons with particularly selected shell glass transition temperatures.",

Further, the products 100 and 120 presented herein may be used in any desired environment.",

The structure may include a material having a plurality of gas-filled microballoons. In some approaches, the plurality of gas-filled microballoons may be a plurality of gas-filled polymer microballoons. Moreover, in some approaches, the structure may have hierarchical porosity. A structure having hierarchical porosity is defined as a structure having porosity across multiple lengthscales.",
                        "FIG. 1A is a schematic drawing of a product 100 of an elastomeric matrix material 102 that contains Tg-specific polymer microballoons 104. In one approach, as shown in FIG. 1A, a product 100 of elastomeric matrix material 102 with polymer microballoons may be cast (e.g. molded, formed, etc) into a bulk structure (e.g. monolith, mold, etc).",

The matrix material 102 may be an elastomeric material that provides dampening and cushioning but typically may not provide shape memory.",
                        "In various inventive concepts, the thin-walled Tg-specific polymer microballoons 104 may provide a shape retention component of the structure, for example, a structure printed with an elastomer matrix filled with thin-walled Tg-specific polymer microballoons allow imposition of shape memory behavior to an elastomer matrix.",
                        "In another approach, an open cell composite structure formed by 3D printing (as shown in product 120, FIG. 1B) may have elastomeric matrix material 102 that provides structural porosity, and the flexible, thin-walled Tg-specific polymer microballoons 104 provide intrastrand porosity as well as shape change memory. In other approaches, an open cell composite structure may be formed as a mold or cast by foam-forming processes in which open pores are imparted in the matrix material. As described with the closed cell composite above, the matrix material 102 may be an elastomeric material that provides dampening and cushioning but typically may not, by itself, provide shape memory. In various inventive concepts, the thin-walled Tg-specific polymer microballoons may provide a shape retention component of the structure, for example, a structure printed with an elastomer matrix filled with thin-walled Tg-specific polymer microballoons allow application of shape memory to an elastomer matrix.",
                        "In one approach, the matrix material 102 may be an energy dissipating material. In another approach, the matrix material 102 may also and/or alternatively be an elastomer material. Illustrative matrix materials 102 include rubbery polymers, siloxane, polysiloxane, polyolefins (e.g. ethylene-propylene, isobutylene, isoprene, chloroprene . . . rubbers), polyurethanes, fluorinated olefins, polyethers, and their copolymers; acrylics (poly-n-butyl acrylate, poly-ethyl acrylate, their copolymers), etc. In an exemplary approach, the matrix material 102 is a siloxane resin.",
                        "FIG. 1C shows a schematic drawing of the cross-sectional view of a Tg-specific polymer microballoon 104, according to one approach. The polymer microballoon may be referred to as microsphere, microbead, etc., as the shape of the microballoon may be spherical, but other shapes are also contemplated. In some approaches, the polymer microballoon may be an expandable microscopic sphere. In one approach, the polymer microballoon has a thermoplastic shell 106 that encapsulates a filling 108 that may include a gas with a low boiling point, e.g. isobutane. In various approaches, the shell 106 of the microballoon may be formed from copolymer material.",
                        "Flexible, polymer microballoons with a desired Tg may be obtained commercially or synthesized using methods known by those skilled in the art, e.g. emulsification techniques, micro-fluidic techniques, etc. In exemplary approaches, flexible, Tg-specific polymer microballoons mixed in with an elastomeric matrix allow shape change when heated above the Tg of the microballoons and retain the shape change at cooler temperatures. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the Tg-specific polymer microballoons are capable of counteracting the elastic force of the elastomeric matrix when certain conditions are met, such as application of heat to the microballoons, thereby resulting in a shape change memory of the typically elastomeric, porous matrix structure.",
                        "Polymer microballoons having any possible Tg may be used in various embodiments. The particular Tg may be selected based on the desired application.",
                        "In some approaches, the shell 106 may be a structured copolymer material that contributes to a Tg of the polymer microballoon where the Tg of the polymer microballoon is between a lower temperature that allows deformation of the structure containing the polymer microballoons and a higher temperature that allows recovery of the original shape of the structure containing the polymer microballoons. In an exemplary approach, the Tg of the polymer microballoon may be between about 40\u00b0 C. and about 60\u00b0 C. In one specific example, the Tg of the polymer microballoon may be preferably about 44\u00b0 C., referred to herein as Tg44.",
                        "The co-polymer microballoons may have any desired diameter. In some approaches, the size of the co-polymer microballoons may have a diameter in a range of about 20 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm, preferably 30 \u03bcm to about 50 \u03bcm. In some approaches, an upper limit may be determined by the structural dimensions of the polymer composite. In exemplary approaches, microballoons may be 5:1 or preferably, 10:1 the smallest length of the part for continuum-like behavior. Upper limits may be limited by localized effects that may dominate in the polymer composite with larger microballoons.",
                        "In some approaches, the volume % (vol %) concentration of microballoons in the matrix material may be in the range of from about 5 vol % to a maximum packing of the microballoons in the matrix material, where the maximum vol % of microballoons may vary depending on the type of matrix material and the type and size of microballoons. In an exemplary approach to enable shape change memory, the vol % of microballoons may be in the range of about 20 vol % to about 50 vol % of microballoons in the matrix material.",
                        "Various inventive concepts described herein, the porous 3D printed polymer structure may have at least 97% shape memory behavior compared to an original shape of the structure. The shape memory behavior may be defined as follows: compression of the structure, followed by heating near or above Tg, results in up to about 60% reduction in original thickness of the structure after cooling and removal of physical constraints; subsequent heating of this compressed structure above Tg results in at least 97% recovery of original thickness.",
                        "In some approaches, the porous 3D printed polymer structure following recovery from compression may have at least 97% structure porosity compared to the porosity of the structure before compression.",

As an option, the present method 200 may be implemented to form structures such as those shown in the other FIGS. described herein. Of course, however, this method 200 and others presented herein may be used to form structures for a wide variety of devices and/or purposes which may or may not be related to the illustrative embodiments listed herein.

In some approaches, the mixture may be an ink for additive manufacturing. In some approaches, the mixture may be an ink for three-dimensional (3D) printing. In some approaches, the mixture may be an ink for direct ink writing. In preferred approaches, the mixture may be a siloxane-based ink for direct ink writing.",

In some approaches, the plurality of gas-filled microballoons may include a shell having copolymer material. In other approaches, the plurality of gas-filled microballoons may include a shell having polymer material. Illustrative examples of shell material include polymethylmethacrylate, polystryrene, polystyrenedivinylbenzene copolymer, polycarbonate, polyacetal, polyethyleneterephthalate, polyethylenenaphthalate, etc. In one approach, the plurality of gas-filled microballoons may include a shell having phenol formaldehyde resin. In preferred approaches, the shell of the gas filled microballoons may include poly(vinylidene chloride-co-acrylonitrile-co-methyl methacrylate (e.g. as included in Expancel).",

The transition temperature in the microballoon shell allows the material comprised of the microballoons to take on a temporary shape at temperatures below the transition temperature.

The effect of the Tg113 microballoons was lessened in the 3D printed structure of 25 vol % Tg113 microballoons (dotted line) which exhibited greater deformation below 600 kPa.

Complete thickness recovery was observed upon reheating to 110\u00b0 C. for 2.5 hours (vertical bar).
