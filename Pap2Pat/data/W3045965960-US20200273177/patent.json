At present, the mechanical assembly industry in China is low in automation level. The assembly of a large number of customized products and complex mechanical products still relies on manual assembly. Due to the frequent change of product types and the large number of parts, the process and assembly accuracy are highly required. During the assembly, various events such as missing of parts and wrong assembly sequence occur easily, which affect the product assembly quality and efficiency. In order to better adapt to the new situation of the manufacturing industry and to meet the assembly of large-scale customized products, the conventional assembly workshop urgently needs an intelligent assembly monitoring system that can intelligently identify parts of the assembly body and monitor the assembly process.",

As a result, the components needed during the final assembly of products are not all in readiness, thereby affecting the production efficiency. Therefore, it is also necessary to monitor and coordinate the assembly progresses of components, thus to improve the assembly efficiency.",

The training process requires artificially designed deep differential features, and features cannot be learned automatically. This technical solution can only realize part identification and determine whether the part is wrong, and cannot further monitor whether the assembly position and assembly sequence of the part are wrong, so it is impossible to detect missing and misplacing in time."
