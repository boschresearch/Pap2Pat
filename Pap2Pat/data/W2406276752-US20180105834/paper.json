    "abstract": "Transgenic pigs play an important role in producing higher quality food in agriculture and improving human health when used as animal models for various human diseases in biomedicine. Production of transgenic pigs, however, is a lengthy and inefficient process that hinders research using pig models. Recent applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for generating site-specific gene knockout/knockin models, including a knockout pig model, have significantly accelerated the animal model field. However, a knockin pig model containing a site-specific transgene insertion that can be passed on to its offspring remains lacking. Here, we describe for the first time the generation of a site-specific knockin pig model using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and somatic cell nuclear transfer. We also report a new genomic \u201csafe harbor\u201d locus, named pH11 , which enables stable and robust transgene expression. Our results indicate that our CRISPR/Cas9 knockin system allows highly efficient gene insertion at the pH11 locus of up to 54% using drug selection and 6% without drug selection. We successfully inserted a gene fragment larger than 9 kb at the pH11 locus using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our data also confirm that the gene inserted into the pH11 locus is highly expressed in cells, embryos and animals.",

                        "An important factor for efficient transgene knockin and expression is the requirement of a \u201csafe harbor\u201d genomic locus that allows gene expression without disrupting internal gene function. Although the Rosa26 locus has been widely used in mice, humans and pigs, it is not ideal for some gene insertions where the Rosa26 promoter could interfere with transgene expression171819. An alternative genomic locus, the Hipp11 (H11) locus, was first described by Hippenmeyer et al.20 and further validated in transgenic mice21 and in human stem cells22. In mice, the H11 locus is located within an intergenic region between the Eif4enif1 and Drg1 genes, which are mapped close to the centromere of chromosome 11. In vivo experiments verified that integration and biallelic expression of the transgenes at the H11 locus did not interfere with mouse viability or fertility. The same study showed that the H11 locus displays a high level of global transgene expression and a higher rate of interchromosomal recombination when compared with the Rosa26 locus in mice. The H11 locus does not contain any promoter, thus allowing the gene of interest to be expressed under its own promoter, for example, a tissue-specific promoter to specifically express the transgene in that tissue. The H11 orthologous locus in humans is located on human chromosome 22q12.2, between the DRG1 and EIF4ENIF1 genes, approximately 700\u2009bp 3\u2032 to the 3\u2032 UTR of human EIF4ENIF1. Transgene expression at the human H11 (hH11) locus in human embryonic stem (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells was proven to be robust and ubiquitous. Given the data from transgenic mice and human stem cells, we reasoned that the H11 locus would likely support transgene expression in pigs and serve as a \u201csafe harbor\u201d and transcriptionally active genomic locus for transgene insertion.",
                        "To identify the H11 orthologous locus in the pig genome, we first located DRG1 and EIF4ENIF1 in pig chromosomes and identified the pig equivalent locus pH11 by its distance from these two genes. Pig DRG1 and EIF4ENIF1 are located on chromosome 14q. The distances between these two genes are very similar among mice, humans and pigs. The intron/exon organization of DRG1 and EIF4ENIF1 is also highly conserved among these three species. We screened the region and chose a site where primers could be readily designed for amplification of homologous arms. The pH11 site we identified is 3.7\u2009kb 3\u2032 of DRG1 and 1.3\u2009kb 5\u2032 of EIF4ENIF1 (Fig. 1A)."

                        "Three genome-editing approaches, TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas9n (nickase), were investigated to develop an efficient gene knockin system. According to the pH11 locus sequence, two sgRNAs for the CRISPR/Cas9 system (supplementary S1 Data), six pairs of TALENs (supplementary S2 Data) and one pair of sgRNAs for the CRISPR/Cas9n system (supplementary S3 Data) were designed. The overall strategy is shown in Fig. 1B. The targeting and DNA cutting efficiency by these three gene-editing methods was tested by a T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay and confirmed by sequencing. T7EI digestion assays indicated that the targeting/cutting efficiencies of the six pairs of TALENs and one pair of CRISPR/Cas9n system were <3% (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system that used two sgRNAs, Cas9-H11-g1 and Cas9-H11-g2, reached 50% and 34%, respectively (Fig. 1D). When sequencing was used to more precisely detect the gene targeting efficiency, Cas9-H11-g1 reached 64%, whereas Cas9-H1-g2 reached 57% (supplementary S1 Figure). To predict potential off-target activity, 10 and 13 putative off-target sites in the pig genome were identified and analyzed for Cas9-H11-g1 and Cas9-H11-g2, respectively (Fig. 2 and supplementary S1 Data). T7EI assays showed that none of the PCR products of the predicted off-target sites were digested by T7EI, suggesting that off-target cleavage did not appear to occur for the two sgRNAs in all the 23 highly similar sites predicted, at least within the detection scope of T7E1 digestion (Fig. 2). Thus, our CRISPR/Cas9 system is relatively safe for knockin at pH11. Cas9-H11-g1, which had the highest activity, was selected to target the pH11 locus."

                        "We first utilized a positive and negative selection method to insert GFP into the pH11 locus in pig primary fetal fibroblast (PFF) cell lines derived from Bama mini pigs. The targeting donor vector pLHG-H11-GFP-DTA contained a reporter cassette with neomycin resistance (Neo) and green fluorescence protein (GFP) genes driven by the CMV promoter, as well as the red fluorescence protein (RFP) gene without a promoter. The reporter cassette was flanked by a 0.8\u2009kb homologous arm to the pH11 locus on each side with the diphtheria toxin A (DTA) gene at the 3\u2032 end (Fig. 1B). The promoterless RFP was included to test if any adjacent promoters could initiate ectopic expression. The total size of the fragment between the two homologous arms was 4.2\u2009kb. The donor vector was linearized by BclI digestion and introduced into PFF cells along with the Cas9-H11-g1 and Cas9 vectors by nucleofection (Amaxa). After 3 days of culture, the PFF cells were plated at 10,000-20,000 cells per 10 cm dish. G418 selection for Neomycin started 2 days later and continued for 12 days. Green fluorescence was not detectable until day 8 after selection (Fig. 3A, left) and most clones reached a high level of green fluorescence 10 days after selection. To identify cell clones that had GFP inserted at the pH11 locus, clones with positive green fluorescence were picked and genotyped using 3 pairs of primers (two for the left arm (H11-P1-F and H11-P1-R, H11-P2-F) and one for the right arm (H11-P2-R, H11-P3-F and H11-P3-R) (Table S2) to amplify the PCR products. The PCR products were then sequenced. All 31 positive clones contained correct recombinants with the transgene inserted specifically at the pH11 locus (Fig. 3C,D, Figure S2). GFP expression in these pH11-GFP PFF cell clones was further observed by fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Robust green fluorescence was detected in all 31 positive clones (Fig. 3B). No red fluorescence was detected in any of the clones, indicating that adjacent promoters could not initiate expression.",
                        "As a delay in GFP expression was observed with the double selection method, we suspected that DTA might adversely affect gene insertion rate; thus, positive screening using only Neo selection was performed in the following experiments. The DTA gene was first removed from the pLHG-H11-GFP-DTA vector to create the donor vector puc-H11-GFP (Fig. 1B). Three days after nucleofecting PFF cells with the linearized puc-H11-GFP donor, Cas9-H11-g1 and Cas9 vectors, the cells were plated at a density of 1,000-2,000 cells per 10\u2009cm dish. Green fluorescence was detected after 3 days of culture in most PFF cells (Fig. 3A, middle image). Cells were then selected by adding G418 2 days later and maintained in culture for 12 days. Clones with site-specifically inserted GFP (pH11-GFP) were analyzed using the 3 pairs of primers described above for the positive and negative selection method (Table S2), and the PCR products were sequenced. All of the 104 positive clones fluoresced green and none fluoresced red (Fig. 3B, middle image and Figure S3).",
                        "In view of the high gene insertion efficiency of our CRISPR/Cas9 system, we predicted that the correct pH11-GFP clones could be obtained without any antibiotics/toxin selection. To test this prediction, linearized puc-H11-GFP vector was transfected into PFF cells with the Cas9-H11-g1 and Cas9 vectors by nucleofection. After 3 days of culture, green fluorescence was detected in most PFF cells (Fig. 3A, right). Cells were then plated at 50\u2013100 cells per dish for limited dilution. After genotyping and fluorescence observation, 22 clones were identified to be positive for site-specific insertion of GFP (Fig. 3C,D, Figure S2). All of the 22 clones expressed GFP and none expressed RFP.",
                        "To investigate whether the system would be suitable for inserting large DNA fragments, the GFP gene was replaced by a 9.4\u2009kb fragment containing the Neo resistance gene and some bacterial backbone DNA, resulting in the donor vector pLHG-H11-Long-DTA (Fig. 1B). The linearized donor, Cas9-H11-g1 and Cas9 vectors were then co-transfected into PFF cells, and selection was performed using the positive and negative selection method described above. A total of 23 positive clones with site-specific insertion of the 9.4\u2009kb fragment were obtained and confirmed by genotyping (Table 1)."

From our PCR and sequencing results (Table 1), a total of 31 positive clones were obtained out of 132 clones using positive and negative selection methods (23% efficiency). Interestingly, the efficiency with the positive selection method was higher at 54% (104 clones out of 192 total clones screened). One possible explanation for this result is that the DTA gene may reduce site-specific insertion efficiency through down-regulation of sgRNA and/or Cas9. DNA fragments as large as 9.4\u2009kb were efficiently inserted at the pH11 locus. A total of 23 out of 96 clones (24%) carried site-specific insertions of the 9.4\u2009kb fragment from the positive and negative selection method. This efficiency is similar to that of insertion of the smaller 4.2\u2009kb donor. Furthermore, a total of 22 positive clones out of 362 clones (6%) were obtained without any drug selection. All positive clones obtained from this study carried one copy of the inserted gene and they were all hemizygotes. Thus, our CRISPR/cas9 system with the Cas9-H11-g1 gRNA provides an efficient genome-editing tool for site-specific insertion of DNA fragments as large as 9.4\u2009kb."

As expected, homology directed recombination occurred at the pH11 locus with expected 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 PCR junction fragments and sequences (Fig. 4D,E).

As shown in Fig. 4, GFP was observed in 2-cell and 4-cell stage embryos prior to embryo transfer (Fig. 4A) and in the new-born transgenic piglet (Fig. 4C), and was later present in various tissue sections in the cloned piglet detected by immunochemistry staining. GFP expression was present in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and muscle tissues (Fig. 4G). GFP expression observed in 2 to 4-cell embryos may have originated from the cytoplasm of the donor cell. This is because the transition from the maternal to the embryonic expression of the genome is after the 4-cell stage in the pig."

                "In this study, we developed a novel strategy to achieve precise, site-specific gene integration in pigs by combining CRISPR/Cas9-assisted homology directed recombination (HDR) with a newly described pH11 locus for efficient gene insertion and expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9, gene integration efficiency as high as 50\u201360% can be achieved. Reporter GFP expression is present in both embryos and animal tissues. Our method offers many advantages over random transgene integration methods, such as no position effect, stability of single-copy insertion, and higher efficiency. This method is also considerably simpler, more rapid and efficient than targeted transgenesis using traditional homologous recombination (HR) in PFF cells or transposon-assisted method. Efficiency in targeted transgenesis using traditional HR is low at <6% with drug selection67. Construction of a traditional HR gene-targeting vector is technically challenging and time consuming due to its large size and many components10.",
                "In order to establish an efficient gene knockin system, we started out by investigating three genome-editing approaches, TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas9n (nickase). Our data showed that CRISPR/Cas9 has a higher efficiency in targeting and cutting DNA at the pig H11 locus compared to CRISPR/Cas9n or TALENs. This result was anticipated since CRISPR/Cas9 was shown in other published studies to be more efficient than the TALEN or ZFN system. For the pH11 locus, the one gRNA for Cas9 turned out to be effective in targeting the locus. On the other hand, the fact that we were only able to obtain heterozygous gene knockin is consistent with the notion that CRISPR/Cas9 is still not efficient for gene knockin. This is mainly because non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair over-competes homology-directed repair (HDR) once a DNA double strand break is made by Cas9. Previous studies have shown that the frequency of CRISPR/Cas9-assisted HDR could be improved by adding factors that inhibit NHEJ such as Scr72324. Small molecules that enhance CRISPR-mediated HDR have also been reported25. We intend to investigate the effects of these molecules on HDR in our future study.",
                "Our work demonstrated for the first time that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used efficiently in generating knockin pig models. As high as 50-60% targeting efficiency was achieved in pig PFF cells at pH11 using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted HDR. These numbers are higher than those previously reported using CRISPR/Cas9, suggesting that the pH11 locus may be in an open chromatin region and serve as a \u201chot spot\u201d for gene insertion. In addition, our knockin system is effective not only for knocking-in a 4.2kb fragment, but is also suitable for a large fragment of 9.4kb. The fragment size appeared to have no obvious impact on the gene insertion efficiency using this CRISPR/Cas9 system.",
                "We also generated pig PFF knockin cell lines with no drug selection at an efficiency of up to 6%. Although adverse effects from Neo and other drug selections to cells and animals have not been reported, the fact that drug selection may harm the cells or animals in ways that we currently do not understand or cannot detect cannot be dismissed. Additionally, leaving drug selection genes in the genome of genetically modified species when they are used as food is not ideal. Drug gene expression could also interfere with internal gene expression. Thus, in some cases, removing the Neo gene from transgenic pigs at the final step is necessary. Traditionally, the Neo gene is inserted into the genome flanked by two loxP sites and removed by Cre1926. Because PFF cell lines cannot sustain two rounds of selection, successive cloning is required to remove the Neo selection marker. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas system is efficient at generating \u201cclean\u201d (with no drug marker) knockin pigs in one step, and saves time and cost for safer transgenic animal production. We also learned that DTA selection lowered the efficiency in gene targeting possibly by inhibiting the function of the CRISPR/Cas9 system2728.",
                "With the one cloned piglet, we were able to show that the pH11 locus supports robust, ubiquitous GFP expression driven by the CMV promoter. Further studies with a tissue-specific promoter driving GFP expression are needed in order to verify if the pH11 is a true \u201csafe harbor\u201d locus. In addition, analysis showing that the nearby gene expression is not affected would further strengthen the notion that pH11 is a safe locus for gene insertion. It would also be informative to compare the pH11 locus in supporting gene expression with other known safe harbor locus such as the Rosa26 locus. In addition, more cloned pigs need to be generated and bred in order to confirm germline transmission.",
                "In summary, genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR represents a practical strategy for rapid and precise generation of transgenic pigs. Targeted transgene insertion at the transcriptionally active locus pH11 enables ubiquitous gene expression driven by a ubiquitous promoter such as CMV. Using this knockin system in pig PFF cells with a subsequent cloning step, transgenic pigs with confirmed insertion of any gene of interest can readily be obtained in as short as 6 months without the need of drug selection. We expect that our knockin system can be adopted and used to generate transgenic animals in other large animal species."

To remove DTA and generate the puc-H11-GFP plasmid, the pLHG-H11-GFP-DTA plasmid was digested with AscI and FseI to release the puc-H11-GFP fragment, which was then ligated to the puc19 vector. The pLHG-H11-Long-DTA vector was generated by replacing the fragment containing GFP in the pLHG-H11-GFP-DTA vector with a 9.4\u2009kb fragment containing the Neo gene."
