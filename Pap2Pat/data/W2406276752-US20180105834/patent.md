# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention belongs to the field of genetic engineering, in particular to a method of site-directed insertion to H11 locus in pigs by using site-directed cutting system.

## BACKGROUND ART

Known in biotechnology research, the target gene is inserted into the genome of the chromosome homologous by using the methods of homologous recombination or transposons, but the practice shows that the low efficiency of homologous recombination, difficult operation, and the original gene was destroyed because of the insertion of the target gene; using the method of transposons, there are some problems such as the site of insertion into the chromosome is random, and the transposase is expensive.

Therefore, due to the limitations of the use of these technologies, in the cultivation of improved varieties of pigs, the foreign genes are randomly inserted into the genome of pigs, thereby the obtained recombinant by using of the corresponding technology make the subsequent breeding and phenotypic analysis very cumbersome.

In 2010, Simon Hippenmeyer of Stanford University and his research team isolated and identified a good gene insertion site on the chromosome 11 in mice, named hipp11 sites, referred to as H11 locus. The H11 site is located in the gap between the two genes Eif4enif1 and Drg1, adjacent to the exon 19 of Eif4enif1 gene and the exon 9 of Drg1 gene, the size of about 5 kb. Because the H11 locus is located between the two genes, it has high security, no gene silencing effect, and has broad-spectrum activity of cell expression. Experiments confirmed that there is no difference in the growth and development between the wild-type mice and the mice modified by Hipp11 site-directed gene. Currently there is similar Ros26 locus, but the site is a gene whose promoter is a broad-spectrum systemic expression, difficult to achieve tissue-specific expression, however there are no similar difficulties in H11 sites, because it is located between two genes, and promoters do not exist, so you can select the desired test promoter to complete spatio-temporal-specific expression of a gene of interest, the better to achieve mission objectives. If the safe and effective genetic modification site such as hipp11 is located in the genome of the pig, it will be conducive to the stability of transgenic pig breeding technology system.

The main method developed in recent years is the precise gene modification based on the sequence-specific nuclease. The sequence-specific nuclease is mainly composed of a DNA recognition domain and an endonuclease domain capable of nonspecific cleavage DNA. The main principle is that the DNA recognition domain firstly recognizes and binds to the DNA fragment needed to transform, then the DNA is cutted by the non-specific enzyme structure connected with DNA, cause the Double-strand break (DSB) of the DNA, the DSB activates DNA's self repair and causes mutations of gene to promote homologous recombination at the site.

ZFN and TALEN targeting technology is two more mature site-directed mutagenesis techniques in the present study, Zinc finger nuclease technology (Zinc Finger Nuclease, ZFN) is the gene precise modification techniques as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, composed of a specific DNA recognition domain and a non-specific endonuclease. In the ZFN recognition domain, a zinc finger structure may specifically identify plurality (typically three) consecutive bases, and the plurality zinc finger could recognize a series of bases. Therefore, in the design process of ZFN, the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger recognition domain is the focus, in particular, how to design more lysine2-histidine 2 (Cys2-His2) zinc finger protein in series, and how to decide the specific nucleotide triplet identified by each zinc finger protein by altering the 16 amino acid residues of Î±-helix.

The feasibility of ZFN technology in gene targeting modification has made it widely used in the gene modification of individual level and cellular level. First of all, it was realized by using of ZFN technology to achieve the gene targeted modification of the cellular level. For example, company Sangamo for the first time achieved ZFN mediated gene targeting in cultured human cell lines in 2005, and achieved the targeted gene site insertion through homologous recombination genes by using the same ZFN in 2007. Recently, people used ZFN to achieve the targeted mutation of the gene in human iPS and ES cells.

In contrast, the transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) has more advantages, it is another new technology which can achieve efficient site directed modification of the genome following the zinc finger nuclease technology. Transcription factor activation effector family has a protein (TALEs) which can identify and combine DNA. The specific binding of TALE and DNA sequence is mainly mediated by 34 constant amino acid sequences in TAL structure. The TALEs is connected with the cutting domain of FokI endonuclease, to form the TALEN, so that the double chain of the genome DNA can be modified at the specific sites.

There is a repeating area in the center of the TALE, which is usually made up of the repeating units with a variable number of 33-35 amino acids. Repeat Domain is responsible for identifying the specific DNA sequences. Each repeat sequence is essentially the same, except for the two variable amino acids, that is Repeat-Variable Diresidues (RVD). DNA recognition mechanism of TALE is that the RVD on a repeat sequence can identify a nucleotide on the DNA target point, and then fuse FokI nucleic acid enzyme, to combine into TALEN. TALEN is a heterodimer molecule (TALE DNA-binding domain of the two units are fused to the catalytic domain of one unit), can cut two sequences which are close to each one, making specific enhancements, so that the specificity is enhanced. The enzyme has the advantages of high efficiency, low toxicity, short preparation period, low cost and so on, that become increasingly evident.

(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) is a kind of evolving immune defense mechanism of the bacteria and the ancient bacteria. In recent years, researchers found that CRISPR/Cas9 use a small RNA to recognize and cut DNA to degrade foreign nucleic acid molecule. Cong etc. and Mali etc. can also prove that the Cas9 system can carry out effective targeted enzyme digestion in 293T, K562, iPS cells and other kinds of cells, and the efficiency of non-homologous recombination (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR) is 3-25%, equivalent to the efficiency of the TALEN enzyme digestion. They also demonstrated that multiple targets can be simultaneously carried out targeted enzyme digestion.

The efficiency of traditional targeting is very low, which is completed mainly dependent on random exchange of intracellular homologous recombinant, the efficiency is very low. With the help of the above mentioned target cutting techniques, it will provide a good support for the research of gene function and breeding of animals and plants.

The PCR results of recombinant cells of said TALEN target cutting system and CRISPR/Cas9 target cutting system are identified with enzyme cutting by using T7 endonuclease I (T7 endonuclease I, T7E1) (NO: #E001L) of VIewSolid Biotech. Specific steps are:

(2) The PCR products of mutant DNA and wild type DNA are mixed with the following system, and the heat denaturation and annealing treatment are carried out (95Â° C. 5 min, naturally cooled to room temperature).

(3) The 0.5 ul T7E1 enzyme is added to the above reaction system, after reaction at 37Â° C. for 30 min, enzyme digestion results are detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, the electrophoretogram of the recombinant cells enzyme digestion results of the TALEN target cutting system is shown in FIG. 2, the electrophoretogram of the recombinant cells enzyme digestion results of the CRISPR/Cas9n target cutting system is shown in FIG. 3. Wherein, the Lane 1 in FIG. 2 is TALEN-H11-L1 and TALEN-H11-R1, the Lane 2 is TALEN-H11-L2 and TALEN-H11-R1, the Lane 3 is TALEN-H11-L3 and TALEN-H11-R1, the Lane 4 is TALEN-H11-L1 and TALEN-H11-R2, the Lane 5 is TALEN-H11-L2 and TALEN-H11-R2, the Lane 6 is TALEN-H11-L3 and TALEN-H11-R2, the Lane P is positive transfection Cas9n, the Lane N is control cell. If the TALEN is effective, the target will be cutted out of the 160 bp+230 bp band, target 2 will be cutted out of the 170 bp+220 bp band, the restriction fragment after cutting can be seen from the above figure, and the bands of 3, 4, 5, 6 combination are brighter, the cutting efficiency is higher than 1, 2 groups. Figure of T7EI enzyme digestion: the Lane 1 is TALEN-H11-L1 and TALEN-H11-R1, the Lane 2 is TALEN-H11-L2 and TALEN-H11-R1, the Lane 3 is TALEN-H11-L3 and TALEN-H11-R1, the Lane 4 is TALEN-H11-L1 and TALEN-H11-R2, the Lane 5 is TALEN-H11-L2 and TALEN-H11-R2, the Lane 6 is TALEN-H11-L3 and TALEN-H11-R2, the Lane P is positive transfection Cas9n (introduced in another patent), the Lane N is control cell. If the TALEN is effective, the target will be cutted out of the 160 bp+230 bp band, target 2 will be cutted out of the 170 bp+220 bp band, the restriction fragment after cutting can be seen from the above figure, and the bands of 3, 4, 5, 6 combination are brighter, the efficiency is estimated at about 2%-3%.

From the results of FIG. 3, if the sgRNA is effective, the target position 1 will cutted out the 160 bp+230 bp band, the target position 2 will cutted out the 170 bp+220 bp band, the fuzzy restriction fragment can be seen from the FIG. 3, so the pair of gRNA have certain activity. The specificity of the pair of sgRNA in the cleavage of H11 target site is very strong, which can effectively reduce the miss phenomenon existing in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, greatly increase the efficiency of the fixed point insertion of exogenous gene, and then reduce the impact of the mutation on the non target site of genome caused by nonspecific cleavage.

The identification procedures of cutting results of recombinant cells of CRISPR/Cas9 targeted cutting system are as follows: the PCR amplification product is connected with PMD-18T vector (Takara, No.: D101A), to obtain the connected products, the details of the operation procedures see the description of kit.

The obtained products are transformed into Escherichia coli. DH5a competent cells, and then coated on the LB solid medium plate containing 500 mg/ml ampicillin to culture, 40 clones are randomly selected from two groups respectively and sequenced, proportion of mutant clones in the total number of clones is calculated, so the efficiency of the recombinant plasmid Cas9/gRNA-H11-sg1 and Cas9/gRNA-H11-sg2 plasmid is calculated.

Experimental results are shown in FIG. 4, the results show that: the efficiency of Cas9/gRNA-H11-sg1 is 63% (7 mutants occurred in 11 clones), the efficiency of the Cas9/gRNA-H11-sg2 plasmid is 58% (23 mutants occurred in 40 clones). The results show that the sgRNA could identify the porcine H11 sites efficiently, and carry out fixed point cutting on this site efficiently with the aid of Cas9 enzyme. We can see from the mutation rate of the H11 site of the genomic DNA, for Cas9/gRNA-H11-sg1, its efficiency is 63%, it shows that there are H11 sites of 63 chromosomes in the H11 sites of the 100 chromosomes of the genome identified by the sgRNA, and cutted. In the same way, the efficiency of Cas9/gRNA-H11-sg2 is also very high. It has laid a solid foundation for high efficiency and fixed-point integration experiment to the porcine H11 site.
