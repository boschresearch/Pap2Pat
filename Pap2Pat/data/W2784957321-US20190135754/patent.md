# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

Synthetic methods for the generation of enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters are highly desirable given their prevalence as motifs in a wide variety of biologically active molecules of both natural and unnatural origin, and the pharmaceutical industries increasing recognition for the motif's applicability in drug design. Despite their importance, the number of highly enantioselective transformations that construct quaternary stereocenters under mild reaction conditions is limited, with respect to both cyclic and acyclic systems.

Since 1965, transition metal-catalyzed allylic alkylation has emerged as one of the most powerful methods for the construction of stereocenters. In particular, with the use of prochiral nucleophiles that proceed through tetrasubstituted enolates, the transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective allylic alkylation has proven to be a formidable strategy for accessing chiral quaternary stereocenters in catalytic enantioselective fashion. Although this transformation has been studied for more than 50 years, the use of α-substituted lactones or lactams as prochiral nucleophiles remains significantly under-developed.

It is particularly difficult to construct quaternary stereocenters in scaffolds containing an additional functional handle for further synthetic manipulation, such as α-acyl lactones and lactams. Lactone products could also provide access to acyclic quaternary stereocenters via ring-opening reactions and reduction of the lactam products would enable direct access to functionalized piperidine rings, the most prevalent nitrogenous heterocycle in drug molecules.

Recently, a palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative enantioselective allylic alkylation of enol carbonates derived from γ-butyrolactones was disclosed. Various enol carbonates were used to obtain diverse α-acyl quaternary butyrolactones in moderate to high levels of enantioselectivity. Nonetheless, the limited electrophile scope and challenging nucleophile synthesis limits the practicality of this transformation. In particular, the alkylation appears limited to γ-butyrolactone substrates and an allyl group, and the substrates require low-yielding, multi-step synthesis.

Therefore, the catalytic enantioselective construction of all-carbon quaternary centers represents a considerable challenge in synthetic organic chemistry due to the difficulties associated with effecting an enantioselective C—C bond formation in a sterically hindered environment.

Accordingly, there is a need to develop new reaction protocols that provide access to cyclic and acyclic α-quaternary carboxylic acid derivatives (i.e., acids, esters, amides).

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Overview

Described herein are the enantioselective allylic alkylation of α-acyl lactones and lactams by using an inexpensive nickel catalyst and easily accessible prochiral nucleophiles. The use of an intermolecular allylic alkylation simplifies the substrate synthesis and provides a more convergent approach to these α-quaternary products. Utilizing a commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligand, α-quaternary lactones and lactams can be constructed in good yield (up to 91% yield) and with high enantiomeric excess (up to 90% ee). A broad range of functional groups are compatible with the reaction conditions. A number of product derivatizations showed the synthetic utility of this methodology for constructing small chiral building blocks with multiple functional handles.

### Chiral Ligands

One aspect of the invention relates to the enantioselectivity of the methods. Enantioselectivity results from the use of chiral ligands during the allylic alkylation reaction. Accordingly, the nickel catalyst comprises a chiral ligand. Without being bound by theory, the asymmetric environment that is created around the metal center by the presence of chiral ligands produces an enantioselective reaction. The chiral ligand forms a complex with the transition metal (i.e., nickel), thereby occupying one or more of the coordination sites on the metal and creating an asymmetric environment around the metal center. This complexation may or may not involve the displacement of achiral ligands already complexed to the metal. When displacement of one or more achiral ligands occurs, the displacement may proceed in a concerted fashion, i.e., with both the achiral ligand decomplexing from the metal and the chiral ligand complexing to the metal in a single step. Alternatively, the displacement may proceed in a stepwise fashion, i.e., with decomplexing of the achiral ligand and complexing of the chiral ligand occurring in distinct steps. Complexation of the chiral ligand to the transition metal may be allowed to occur in situ, i.e., by admixing the ligand and metal before adding the substrate. Alternatively, the ligand-metal complex can be formed separately, and the complex isolated before use in the alkylation reactions of the present invention.

Once coordinated to the transition metal center, the chiral ligand influences the orientation of other molecules as they interact with the transition metal catalyst. Coordination of the metal center with a π-allyl group and reaction of the substrate with the π-allyl-metal complex are dictated by the presence of the chiral ligand. The orientation of the reacting species determines the stereochemistry of the products.

Chiral ligands of the invention may be bidentate or monodentate or, alternatively, ligands with higher denticity (e.g., tridentate, tetradentate, etc.) can be used. In preferred embodiments, the ligand is a bidentate ligand. Additionally, it is preferred that the ligand be substantially enantiopure. By “enantiopure” is meant that only a single enantiomer is present. In many cases, substantially enantiopure ligands (e.g., ee>99%, preferably ee>99.5%, even more preferably ee>99.9%) can be purchased from commercial sources, obtained by successive recrystallizations of an enantioenriched substance, or by other suitable means for separating enantiomers.

In certain embodiments, the chiral ligand is an enantioenriched phosphorous-based ligand. In certain embodiments, the enantioenriched phosphorus-based ligand is a bisphosphine ligand. In certain embodiments, the chiral ligand is selected from:

Preferred bisphosphine ligands include:

Bisphosphine ligand L8 is also known as (S)-C3-TunePhos.

In other preferred embodiments, the ligand is

Generally, the chiral ligand is present in an amount in the range of about 1 equivalent to about 20 equivalents relative to the amount of total metal from the catalyst, preferably in the range of about 1 to about 15 equivalents relative to the amount of total metal from the catalyst, and most preferably in the range of about 1 equivalent relative to the amount of total metal from the catalyst. Alternatively, the amount of the chiral ligand can be measured relative to the amount of the substrate.

In certain embodiments, the ligand is present under the conditions of the reaction from an amount of about 0.1 mol % to about 100 mol % relative to the substrate, which is the compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (IV), or (XII). The amount of the chiral ligand present in the reaction is alternatively referred to herein as “ligand loading” and is expressed as a percentage that is calculated by dividing the moles of ligand by the moles of the substrate present in a given reaction. In certain embodiments, the ligand loading is from about 1 mol %, about 1.1 mol %, about 1.2 mol %, about 1.3 mol %, about 1.4 mol %, about 1.5 mol %, about 1.6 mol %, about 1.7 mol %, about 1.8 mol %, about 1.9 mol %, about 2 mol %, about 2.1 mol %, about 2.2 mol %, about 2.3 mol %, about 2.4 mol %, about 2.5 mol %, about 2.6 mol %, about 2.7 mol %, about 2.8 mol %, about 2.9 mol %, about 3 mol %, about 3.1 mol %, about 3.2 mol %, about 3.3 mol %, about 3.4 mol %, about 3.5 mol %, about 3.6 mol %, about 3.7 mol %, about 3.8 mol %, about 3.9 mol %, about 4 mol %, about 4.1 mol %, about 4.2 mol %, about 4.3 mol %, about 4.4 mol %, about 4.5 mol %, about 4.6 mol %, about 4.7 mol %, about 4.8 mol %, about 4.9 mol %, about 5 mol %, about 5.1 mol %, about 5.2 mol %, about 5.3 mol %, about 5.4 mol %, about 5.5 mol %, about 5.6 mol %, about 5.7 mol %, about 5.8 mol %, about 5.9 mol %, about 6 mol %, about 6.1 mol %, about 6.2 mol %, about 6.3 mol %, about 6.4 mol %, about 6.5 mol %, about 6.6 mol %, about 6.7 mol %, about 6.8 mol %, about 6.9 mol %, about 7 mol %, about 7.1 mol %, about 7.2 mol %, about 7.3 mol %, about 7.4 mol %, about 7.5 mol %, about 7.6 mol %, about 7.7 mol %, about 7.8 mol %, about 7.9 mol %, about 8 mol %, about 8.1 mol %, about 8.2 mol %, about 8.3 mol %, about 8.4 mol %, about 8.5 mol %, about 8.6 mol %, about 8.7 mol %, about 8.8 mol %, about 8.9 mol %, about 9 mol %, about 9.1 mol %, about 9.2 mol %, about 9.3 mol %, about 9.4 mol %, about 9.5 mol %, about 9.6 mol %, about 9.7 mol %, about 9.8 mol %, about 9.9 mol %, about 10 mol %, about 10.1 mol %, about 10.2 mol %, about 10.3 mol %, about 10.4 mol %, about 10.5 mol %, about 10.6 mol %, about 10.7 mol %, about 10.8 mol %, about 10.9 mol %, about 11 mol %, about 11.1 mol %, about 11.2 mol %, about 11.3 mol %, about 11.4 mol %, about 11.5 mol %, about 11.6 mol %, about 11.7 mol %, about 11.8 mol %, about 11.9 mol %, about 12 mol %, about 15 mol %, about 20 mol %, or about 25 mol %. In preferred embodiments, the ligand loading is 12 mol %.

Where a chiral ligand is used, the reactions of the invention may enrich the stereocenter bearing the R1- and R2-connected fragments in the product relative to the enrichment at this center, if any, of the starting material. In certain embodiments, the chiral ligand used in the methods of the invention yields a compound of Formula (IX), (VI), (VII), (VIII), or (XI) that is enantioenriched. The level of enantioenrichment of a compound may be expressed as enantiomeric excess (ee). The ee of a compound may be measured by dividing the difference in the fractions of the enantiomers by the sum of the fractions of the enantiomers. For example, if a compound is found to comprise 98% (S)-enantiomer, and 2% (R) enantiomer, then the ee of the compound is (98−2)/(98+2), or 96%. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula (IX), (VI), (VII), (VIII), or (XI) has about 30% ee or greater, about 40% ee or greater, about 50% ee or greater, 60% ee or greater, about 65% ee or greater, about 70% ee or greater, about 75% ee or greater, about 80% ee or greater, about 85% ee or greater, about 88% ee or greater, about 90% ee or greater, about 91% ee or greater, about 92% ee or greater, about 93% ee or greater, about 94% ee or greater, about 95% ee or greater, about 96% ee or greater, about 97% ee or greater, about 98% ee or greater, or about 99% ee or greater, even where this % ee is greater than the % ee of the starting material, such as 0% ee (racemic).

In certain embodiments, the compound of formula (IX), (VI), (VII), (VIII), or (XI) is enantioenriched. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula (IX), (VI), (VII), (VIII), or (XI) is enantiopure.

In embodiments where the starting material has more than one stereocenter, reactions of the invention may enrich the stereocenter bearing the R1- and R2-connected fragments relative to the enrichment at this center, if any, of the starting material, and substantially independently of the stereochemical disposition/enrichment of any other stereocenters of the molecule. For example, a product of the methods described herein may have about 30% ee or greater, about 40% ee or greater, about 50% ee or greater, about 60% ee or greater, about 70% ee or greater, about 80% ee or greater, about 90% ee or greater, about 95% ee or greater, about 98% ee or greater, or even about 99% ee or greater at the stereocenter of the product bearing the R1- and R2-connected fragments.

### Example 1: Nickel-Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Lactones and Lactams with Unactivated Allylic Alcohols

**Summary**

The first nickel-catalyzed enantioselective allylic alkylation of lactone and lactam substrates to deliver products bearing an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter is reported. The reaction, which utilizes a commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligand, proceeds in good yield with a high level of enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee) on a range of unactivated allylic alcohols for both lactone and lactam nucleophiles. The utility of this method is further highlighted via a number of synthetically useful product transformations.

**Results and Discussion**

The enantioselective allylic alkylation between α-ethoxycarbonyl lactone 1a and allyl alcohol (2a) using Ni(COD)2 and (R)-BINAP in diethyl ether at 0° C. was investigated. Although the α-quaternary lactone product 3aa was obtained in good yield, only moderate enantioselectivity was achieved.

A wide variety of commercially available ligand scaffolds were investigated. Chiral bisphosphine ligands were discovered to exhibit superior enantioselectivity to other classes of ligands, including those commonly used in asymmetric allylic alkylations such as phosphinooxazolines (PHOX) or C2-asymmetric ligands. In the presence of Ni(COD)2 (10 mol %) and chiral bisphosphine ligands L1-L4 (12 mol %) in Et2O, the reaction proceeds with moderate levels of enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 1-4).

The highest enantiomeric excess (ee) was achieved with (R)-P-phos (L4), which delivers α-quaternary lactone 3aa in 82% yield and 82% ee (entry 4). Decreasing the catalyst loading to 5 mol % requires exceedingly long reaction time (entry 5).

An examination of different temperatures revealed that decreasing the temperature improves ee (entries 6-7), albeit with slightly diminished yields. Prolonged reaction time (48 h) at −10° C. affords product 3aa in 80% yield and 85% ee (entry 8). Importantly, a control experiment performed in the absence of the chiral ligand shows no background reaction (entry 9).

The scope of this asymmetric transformation was investigated (Table 2). The reaction of α-methoxycarbonyl lactone 1b, possessing a smaller alkyl group at the ester fragment, with allyl alcohol (2a) provides α-quaternary lactone 3ba in comparable yield and ee to the allylated product 3aa. Bicyclic lactone 1c could also be used to furnish product 3ca in slightly diminished yield and enantioselectivity. With respect to the electrophile scope, reactions between lactone 1a with various substituted allyl alcohols proceed with good ee (78-90% ee) at increased temperature (10° C.). Although a trend in enantioselectivity was not observed, the electronic nature of the aryl substituent does affect the reactivity. Electrophiles containing electron rich aryl substituents provide the corresponding products in greater yields than their electron-deficient counterparts (3ac-3ag). Furthermore, para- and meta-substituted aryl rings exhibited higher reactivity as compared to the ortho-substituted aryl ring (3ac, 3ah-ai vs. 3aj). Apart from the aryl-substituted electrophiles, heteroaryl substitution is also well-tolerated (3ak-3al). The reaction with an aliphatic electrophile affords product 3am in slightly diminished yield and ee. In addition, an alkenyl-substituted electrophile fares well under the reaction conditions, delivering product 3an in an excellent 91% yield and 88% ee.

The transformation of nitrogen-containing lactam nucleophiles was also investigated. Under modified reaction conditions using the same chiral bisphosphine ligand L4, α-ester lactams 4a-4b furnish products 5aa-5ba in good yields and with even higher enantioselectivity as compared to their lactone counterparts (Table 3). Reaction of α-ethoxycarbonyl benzoyl-protected lactam 4a with branched cinnamyl alcohol affords linear product 5ab in 74% yield and 90% ee.

In order to gain mechanistic insights into this transformation, the results from reactions using linear and branched cinnamyl alcohols (Table 4) were compared. Only the linear product was detected, indicating that a nickel π-allyl is likely an intermediate in the catalytic cycle. The ability of this catalyst combination to access a single product from two electrophilic coupling partners highlights its flexibility in potential synthetic applications.

To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the α-quaternary products, a number of product transformations on both α-quaternary lactone 3aa (Scheme 10) and lactam 5aa (Scheme 11) were performed. Selective reduction of the lactone functionality in 3aa provides diol 6 in 88% yield. Additionally, vinyl Grignard addition into lactone 3aa affords enone 7 in 67% yield with no erosion of enantioselectivity. These enantioenriched acyclic products 6 and 7 bearing a quaternary stereocenter are envisioned to be useful chiral building blocks as they contain multiple functional handles for further manipulations. For example, enantioenriched spirocycle 8 can be accessed via ring-closing metathesis followed by lactonization of enone 7.

Experiments to probe the reactivity of the α-quaternary lactam products were performed. Reduction of lactam 5aa with lithium aluminium hydride delivers chiral piperidine derivative 9, which is of potential value to medicinal chemists. Use of the aldehyde selective Wacker procedure (K. E. Kim, J. Li, R. H. Grubbs, B. M. Stoltz, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 13179-13182) affords aldehyde 10 in 75% yield. Lastly, cleavage of the benzoyl protecting group under basic conditions provides unprotected lactam 11 in 84% yield.

**Materials and Methods**

Unless otherwise stated, reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere using dry, deoxygenated solvents. Solvents were dried by passage through an activated alumina column under argon. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) or Agilent 1290 UHPLC-MS. TLC was performed using E. Merck silica gel 60 F254 precoated glass plates (0.25 mm) and visualized by UV fluorescence quenching, p-anisaldehyde, or KMnO4 staining. Silicycle SiliaFlash® P60 Academic Silica gel (particle size 40-63 nm) was used for flash chromatography. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 400 MHz or Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometers and are reported relative to residual CHCl3 (δ 7.26 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer (101 MHz) and are reported relative to CHCl3 (δ 77.16 ppm). 19F NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer (282 MHz). Data for 1H NMR are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ ppm) (multiplicity, coupling constant (Hz), integration). Multiplicities are reported as follows: s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, p=pentet, sept=septuplet, m=multiplet, br s=broad singlet, br d=broad doublet, app=apparent. Data for 13C NMR are reported in terms of chemical shifts (δ ppm). IR spectra were obtained using Perkin Elmer Spectrum BXII spectrometer or Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer using thin films deposited on NaCl plates and reported in frequency of absorption (cm−1). Optical rotations were measured with a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter operating on the sodium D-line (589 nm), using a 100 mm path-length cell and are reported as: [α]DT (concentration in 10 mg/1 mL, solvent). Analytical SFC was performed with a Mettler SFC supercritical CO2 analytical chromatography system utilizing Chiralpak (AD-H, AS-H or IC) or Chiralcel (OD-H, OJ-H, or OB-H) columns (4.6 mm×25 cm) obtained from Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained from Agilent 6200 Series TOF with an Agilent G1978A Multimode source in electrospray ionization (ESI+), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI+), or mixed ionization mode (MM: ESI-APCI+), or obtained from Caltech mass spectrometry laboratory. Low-temperature diffraction data (ϕ- and ω-scans) were collected on a Bruker AXS D8 VENTURE KAPPA diffractometer coupled to a PHOTON 100 CMOS detector with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.54178 Å) from an IμS micro-source for the structure of compound P17471. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS and refined against F2 on all data by full-matrix least squares with SHELXL-2016 using established refinement techniques. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were included into the model at geometrically calculated positions and refined using a riding model. The isotropic displacement parameters of all hydrogen atoms were fixed to 1.2 times the U value of the atoms they are linked to (1.5 times for methyl groups).

Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Strem, or Alfa Aesar and used as received unless otherwise stated.

### Example 2

In a nitrogen-filled glovebox, to an oven-dried 4 mL vial equipped with a stir bar was added (S)-C3-TunePhos (14.3 mg, 0.024 mmol, 12 mol %), Ni(COD)2 (5.5 mg, 0.02 mmol, 10 mol %) and Et2O (1.0 mL). The vial was capped with a PTFE-lined cap and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. A solution of the substrate (66.9 mg, 0.20 mmol) in Et2O (0.5 mL) was then added to the catalyst mixture. The substrate vial was rinsed with additional Et2O (0.5 mL) and added to the catalyst mixture. The reaction vial was sealed with a PTFE-lined cap, removed from the glovebox, and stirred at 25° C. for 48 h. The crude reaction mixture was filtered through a silica plug, rinsed with Et2O, and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue was subjected to a filtration over silica gel (20% EtOAc in hexanes) to remove unreacted starting material. After evaporation of solvents, the product was isolated as a mixture of diastereoisomers (24.0 mg, 0.07 mmol, 37% yield, 83:17 dr). Enantiomeric excess=70% ee (Chiralpak IC, 15% IPA in CO2).

Based on literature reference for the corresponding Et-ester (Kates, S. A.; Dombroski, M. A.; Snider, B. B. J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 2427-2436.), preliminary assignment for major diastereoisomer is shown below:
