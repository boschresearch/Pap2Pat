                        "Synthetic methods for the generation of enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters are highly desirable given their prevalence as motifs in a wide variety of biologically active molecules of both natural and unnatural origin, and the pharmaceutical industries increasing recognition for the motif's applicability in drug design. Despite their importance, the number of highly enantioselective transformations that construct quaternary stereocenters under mild reaction conditions is limited, with respect to both cyclic and acyclic systems.",
                        "Since 1965, transition metal-catalyzed allylic alkylation has emerged as one of the most powerful methods for the construction of stereocenters. In particular, with the use of prochiral nucleophiles that proceed through tetrasubstituted enolates, the transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective allylic alkylation has proven to be a formidable strategy for accessing chiral quaternary stereocenters in catalytic enantioselective fashion. Although this transformation has been studied for more than 50 years, the use of \u03b1-substituted lactones or lactams as prochiral nucleophiles remains significantly under-developed.",
                        "It is particularly difficult to construct quaternary stereocenters in scaffolds containing an additional functional handle for further synthetic manipulation, such as \u03b1-acyl lactones and lactams. Lactone products could also provide access to acyclic quaternary stereocenters via ring-opening reactions and reduction of the lactam products would enable direct access to functionalized piperidine rings, the most prevalent nitrogenous heterocycle in drug molecules.",
                        "Recently, a palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative enantioselective allylic alkylation of enol carbonates derived from \u03b3-butyrolactones was disclosed. Various enol carbonates were used to obtain diverse \u03b1-acyl quaternary butyrolactones in moderate to high levels of enantioselectivity. Nonetheless, the limited electrophile scope and challenging nucleophile synthesis limits the practicality of this transformation. In particular, the alkylation appears limited to \u03b3-butyrolactone substrates and an allyl group, and the substrates require low-yielding, multi-step synthesis.",
                        "Therefore, the catalytic enantioselective construction of all-carbon quaternary centers represents a considerable challenge in synthetic organic chemistry due to the difficulties associated with effecting an enantioselective C\u2014C bond formation in a sterically hindered environment.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need to develop new reaction protocols that provide access to cyclic and acyclic \u03b1-quaternary carboxylic acid derivatives (i.e., acids, esters, amides)."

                                "One aspect of the invention relates to the enantioselectivity of the methods. Enantioselectivity results from the use of chiral ligands during the allylic alkylation reaction. Accordingly, the nickel catalyst comprises a chiral ligand. Without being bound by theory, the asymmetric environment that is created around the metal center by the presence of chiral ligands produces an enantioselective reaction. The chiral ligand forms a complex with the transition metal (i.e., nickel), thereby occupying one or more of the coordination sites on the metal and creating an asymmetric environment around the metal center. This complexation may or may not involve the displacement of achiral ligands already complexed to the metal. When displacement of one or more achiral ligands occurs, the displacement may proceed in a concerted fashion, i.e., with both the achiral ligand decomplexing from the metal and the chiral ligand complexing to the metal in a single step. Alternatively, the displacement may proceed in a stepwise fashion, i.e., with decomplexing of the achiral ligand and complexing of the chiral ligand occurring in distinct steps. Complexation of the chiral ligand to the transition metal may be allowed to occur in situ, i.e., by admixing the ligand and metal before adding the substrate. Alternatively, the ligand-metal complex can be formed separately, and the complex isolated before use in the alkylation reactions of the present invention.",
                                "Once coordinated to the transition metal center, the chiral ligand influences the orientation of other molecules as they interact with the transition metal catalyst. Coordination of the metal center with a \u03c0-allyl group and reaction of the substrate with the \u03c0-allyl-metal complex are dictated by the presence of the chiral ligand. The orientation of the reacting species determines the stereochemistry of the products.",

                                "The first nickel-catalyzed enantioselective allylic alkylation of lactone and lactam substrates to deliver products bearing an all-carbon quaternary stereocenter is reported. The reaction, which utilizes a commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligand, proceeds in good yield with a high level of enantioselectivity (up to 90% ee) on a range of unactivated allylic alcohols for both lactone and lactam nucleophiles. The utility of this method is further highlighted via a number of synthetically useful product transformations.",
                                "**Results and Discussion**",
                                "The enantioselective allylic alkylation between \u03b1-ethoxycarbonyl lactone 1a and allyl alcohol (2a) using Ni(COD)2 and (R)-BINAP in diethyl ether at 0\u00b0 C. was investigated. Although the \u03b1-quaternary lactone product 3aa was obtained in good yield, only moderate enantioselectivity was achieved.",
                                "A wide variety of commercially available ligand scaffolds were investigated. Chiral bisphosphine ligands were discovered to exhibit superior enantioselectivity to other classes of ligands, including those commonly used in asymmetric allylic alkylations such as phosphinooxazolines (PHOX) or C2-asymmetric ligands. In the presence of Ni(COD)2 (10 mol %) and chiral bisphosphine ligands L1-L4 (12 mol %) in Et2O, the reaction proceeds with moderate levels of enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 1-4).",
                                "The highest enantiomeric excess (ee) was achieved with (R)-P-phos (L4), which delivers \u03b1-quaternary lactone 3aa in 82% yield and 82% ee (entry 4). Decreasing the catalyst loading to 5 mol % requires exceedingly long reaction time (entry 5).",
                                "An examination of different temperatures revealed that decreasing the temperature improves ee (entries 6-7), albeit with slightly diminished yields. Prolonged reaction time (48 h) at \u221210\u00b0 C. affords product 3aa in 80% yield and 85% ee (entry 8). Importantly, a control experiment performed in the absence of the chiral ligand shows no background reaction (entry 9).",
                                "The scope of this asymmetric transformation was investigated (Table 2). The reaction of \u03b1-methoxycarbonyl lactone 1b, possessing a smaller alkyl group at the ester fragment, with allyl alcohol (2a) provides \u03b1-quaternary lactone 3ba in comparable yield and ee to the allylated product 3aa. Bicyclic lactone 1c could also be used to furnish product 3ca in slightly diminished yield and enantioselectivity. With respect to the electrophile scope, reactions between lactone 1a with various substituted allyl alcohols proceed with good ee (78-90% ee) at increased temperature (10\u00b0 C.). Although a trend in enantioselectivity was not observed, the electronic nature of the aryl substituent does affect the reactivity. Electrophiles containing electron rich aryl substituents provide the corresponding products in greater yields than their electron-deficient counterparts (3ac-3ag). Furthermore, para- and meta-substituted aryl rings exhibited higher reactivity as compared to the ortho-substituted aryl ring (3ac, 3ah-ai vs. 3aj). Apart from the aryl-substituted electrophiles, heteroaryl substitution is also well-tolerated (3ak-3al). The reaction with an aliphatic electrophile affords product 3am in slightly diminished yield and ee. In addition, an alkenyl-substituted electrophile fares well under the reaction conditions, delivering product 3an in an excellent 91% yield and 88% ee.",
                                "The transformation of nitrogen-containing lactam nucleophiles was also investigated. Under modified reaction conditions using the same chiral bisphosphine ligand L4, \u03b1-ester lactams 4a-4b furnish products 5aa-5ba in good yields and with even higher enantioselectivity as compared to their lactone counterparts (Table 3). Reaction of \u03b1-ethoxycarbonyl benzoyl-protected lactam 4a with branched cinnamyl alcohol affords linear product 5ab in 74% yield and 90% ee.",
                                "In order to gain mechanistic insights into this transformation, the results from reactions using linear and branched cinnamyl alcohols (Table 4) were compared. Only the linear product was detected, indicating that a nickel \u03c0-allyl is likely an intermediate in the catalytic cycle. The ability of this catalyst combination to access a single product from two electrophilic coupling partners highlights its flexibility in potential synthetic applications.",
                                "To demonstrate the synthetic utility of the \u03b1-quaternary products, a number of product transformations on both \u03b1-quaternary lactone 3aa (Scheme 10) and lactam 5aa (Scheme 11) were performed. Selective reduction of the lactone functionality in 3aa provides diol 6 in 88% yield. Additionally, vinyl Grignard addition into lactone 3aa affords enone 7 in 67% yield with no erosion of enantioselectivity. These enantioenriched acyclic products 6 and 7 bearing a quaternary stereocenter are envisioned to be useful chiral building blocks as they contain multiple functional handles for further manipulations. For example, enantioenriched spirocycle 8 can be accessed via ring-closing metathesis followed by lactonization of enone 7.",
                                "Experiments to probe the reactivity of the \u03b1-quaternary lactam products were performed. Reduction of lactam 5aa with lithium aluminium hydride delivers chiral piperidine derivative 9, which is of potential value to medicinal chemists. Use of the aldehyde selective Wacker procedure (K. E. Kim, J. Li, R. H. Grubbs, B. M. Stoltz, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 13179-13182) affords aldehyde 10 in 75% yield. Lastly, cleavage of the benzoyl protecting group under basic conditions provides unprotected lactam 11 in 84% yield.",
