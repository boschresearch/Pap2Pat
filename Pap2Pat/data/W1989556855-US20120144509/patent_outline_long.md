### Isolation of Clinical Strains

- obtain clinical isolates
- resurrect isolates from glycerol stocks
- grow isolates on selective blood agar plates
- genotype isolates
- screen isolates for natural transformation

### Example 2

- test clinical isolates in mouse model
- challenge mice with bacteria
- determine level of colonisation
- identify colonising strains

### Example 3

- further investigate robustness of colonising strains
- select true colonising strains

### Example 4

- test long-term colonisation
- identify strains that establish chronic infection

### Example 5

- determine immunogenicity of colonising H. pylori strains
- test IgG antibody response in DBA/2J mouse model
- measure H. pylori-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA
- show immunogenicity of K6 and K8 strains

### Example 6

- screen H. pylori strains in C57BL/6 mouse model
- identify K4 and K12 strains as colonisers

### Example 7

- optimise H. pylori mouse model
- test effect of diet on colonisation
- show improved colonisation with casein-rich diet

### Example 8

- screen H. pylori strains in additional mouse models
- test colonisation in C3H, FVB/n, CBA, DBA/2, 129/s and Swiss mouse strains
- use semi-synthetic casein-rich protein diet and acidified water
- include X47 strain as comparator
- show K4, K8 and K18 strains as broad-spectrum colonisers
- show K11 and K12 strains as poorer colonisers
- depict results in Table 3 and FIG. 8
