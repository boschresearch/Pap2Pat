## BACKGROUND

- introduce bacterial delivery vehicles
- limitations of current systems

## SUMMARY

- introduce H. pylori strains
- characteristics of H. pylori strains
- embodiments of H. pylori strains
- provide specific H. pylori strains
- transform H. pylori strains
- use of H. pylori strains for delivery

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION

- define scope of invention
- incorporate prior art by reference
- describe conventional techniques
- introduce Helicobacter pylori strains
- define low pathogenicity
- describe virulence factors
- introduce chronic infection
- define mammalian subject
- describe natural transformation
- introduce isolated nucleic acid
- describe biologically active agents
- provide examples of biologically active agents
- describe integration of isolated nucleic acid into genome
- introduce method of identifying suitable strains
- provide examples of suitable strains

### Isolation of Clinical Strains

- isolate clinical strains
- screen for natural transformation

### Example 2

- test for colonisation in mouse model
- determine level of colonisation

### Example 3

- investigate robustness of colonisation

### Example 4

- test for long-term colonisation

### Example 5

- determine immunogenicity of colonising H. pylori strains
- compare immunogenicity to non-colonising strains

### Example 6

- identify clinical isolates that colonise the stomach in the H. Pylori C57BL/6 mouse model

### Example 7

- optimise the H. Pylori mouse model by testing modifications to diet and water

### Example 8

- screen H. Pylori colonising strains in additional mouse models
- test strains in C3H, FVB/n, CBA, DBA/2, 129/s, Swiss (ARC) and C57
- evaluate colonisation of stomach after 2-4 weeks
- determine colonisation frequency
- identify K4, K8 and K18 as broad-spectrum colonisers
- identify K11 and K12 as poorer colonisers
- test X47 as a comparator
- evaluate colonisation in various mouse strains
- determine bacterial load per group
- identify K4, K8 and K18 as robust colonisers
- identify K11 and K12 as weaker colonisers
- summarise results in Table 3 and FIG. 8
