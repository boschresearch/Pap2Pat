    "title": "Turning bubbles on and off during boiling using charged surfactants",
    "date": "2015-10-21",
    "abstract": "Boiling\u2014a process that has powered industries since the steam age\u2014is governed by bubble formation. State-of-the-art boiling surfaces often increase bubble nucleation via roughness and/or wettability modification to increase performance. However, without active in situ control of bubbles, temperature or steam generation cannot be adjusted for a given heat input. Here we report the ability to turn bubbles \u2018on and off\u2019 independent of heat input during boiling both temporally and spatially via molecular manipulation of the boiling surface. As a result, we can rapidly and reversibly alter heat transfer performance up to an order of magnitude. Our experiments show that this active control is achieved by electrostatically adsorbing and desorbing charged surfactants to alter the wettability of the surface, thereby affecting nucleation. This approach can improve performance and flexibility in existing boiling technologies as well as enable emerging or unprecedented energy applications.",

                        "We demonstrate our ability to actively control bubble nucleation to the extent of turning bubble formation \u2018on and off' (Fig. 1; Supplementary Movie 1). This is achieved by electrostatically adsorbing and desorbing charged surfactants using small electric potentials (\u22642\u2009V). We applied a constant heat input of 60\u2009W to boil deionized (DI) water with 2.6\u2009mM of negatively charged surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) within a 2 \u00d7 2\u2009cm area on a silver boiling surface (Fig. 1a). During boiling, we changed the electric potential applied between the surface and a counter electrode immersed in the fluid (Vcell=Vsurf\u2212Vcounter) from \u22120.1 to \u22122.0\u2009V, which resulted in bubble nucleation immediately subsiding (Fig. 1b). The more negative potential electrostatically repelled the negatively charged SDS away from the surface, diminishing the hydrophobic \u2018coating' on the surface, which increased wettability and suppressed nucleation. An illustration of the effect of wettability on nucleation is shown in Fig. 2, with more detailed explanation in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1. The weakening of the negative potential from \u22122.0 to \u22120.1\u2009V electrostatically attracted SDS to the surface, augmented the hydrophobic \u2018coating' and increased nucleation (Fig. 1c). Both nucleation suppression and promotion occurred rapidly (<600 and <300\u2009ms, respectively). The difference in settling times is attributed to nucleation hysteresis23. These results show that solid\u2013liquid adsorption/desorption plays a large role in nucleation."

                        "To investigate the adsorption/desorption mechanism in more detail, we quantified the electrical and thermal response during boiling of solutions of both the negatively charged surfactant SDS and the positively charged surfactant dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) to an applied square wave potential (Vcell ranged between \u22120.1 and \u22122.0\u2009V, 60\u2009s period; Fig. 3). We chose the electrode materials and potential range of \u22120.1 to \u22122.0\u2009V based on cyclic voltammetry experiments (Supplementary Fig. 2) to ensure that redox reactions were minimal and that the system behaved like a capacitor for adsorption/desorption behaviour (see Methods and Supplementary Note 2). All surfactants were at a low concentration of 2.6\u2009mM so as not to affect bulk physical properties. This concentration is below the critical micelle concentration of all surfactants in this study (Supplementary Note 3; Supplementary Table 1). The current response for SDS and DTAB (Fig. 3) confirmed capacitive behaviour with a steady-state current not exceeding 60\u2009\u03bcA\u2009cm\u22122. The thermal response was measured using embedded thermocouples under the boiling surface (see the Methods section) and the results support the adsorption/desorption mechanism. For negatively charged SDS, the temperature increased and the HTC decreased with more negative potential (repelling SDS) since more heat was dissipated through convection as opposed to vapour generation. Accordingly, the temperature was out of phase with potential while the HTC was in-phase with potential (Fig. 3a). In contrast, with positively charged DTAB, the opposite temperature and HTC response was obtained (Fig. 3b) as expected."

                        "Additional experiments where the potential input was a slow triangle wave (quasi-static change in potential) corroborated the square wave experiments (Supplementary Fig. 3). The oppositely charged surfactants SDS and DTAB had opposite thermal responses to the same voltage input. In addition, two negative controls were tested: sodium bromide (NaBr), which is a non-surfactant salt (counterions of SDS and DTAB), as well as n-decanoyl-n-methylglucamine (MEGA-10), which is a nonionic surfactant. There was no change in nucleation, temperature or HTC with potential for the negative controls (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4). Direct measurements of the advancing contact angles with NaBr, MEGA-10, SDS and DTAB under boiling conditions with different potentials (Supplementary Fig. 5) were consistent with the observed changes in nucleation. In fact, the contact angle of DTAB increased with voltage magnitude as expected; this demonstrates a phenomenon that is completely opposite from electrowetting. Furthermore, the contact angle measurements and triangle wave experiments rule out other mechanisms for actively controlled boiling, that is, EHD or electrolysis, both of which do not rely on charged surfactants (Supplementary Note 4). Moreover, the applied potentials remained in the purely capacitive region (\u22120.1 to \u22120.8\u2009V) and were three orders of magnitude smaller than that in EHD boiling24. Since the system is capacitive, the number of adsorbed charged surfactants, alteration of boiling nucleation, temperature and HTC (Supplementary Fig. 3) should gradually change with potential as was observed (that is, there is no critical voltage at which these changes suddenly occur). These results indicate that charged surfactants that electrostatically adsorb to the surface decrease wettability and increase nucleation."

                        "The performance and degree of field-induced tunability of boiling were quantified by obtaining and analysing boiling curves\u2014the relationship between q\u2032\u2032 and superheat (Fig. 4). In these experiments, 2.6\u2009mM of either NaBr, MEGA-10, SDS or DTAB was added to DI water and a Vcell was applied while the heater power was varied in a quasi-static manner. The boiling curves of NaBr and MEGA-10 at \u22120.1 and \u22122.0\u2009V did not change with potential (Fig. 4a,b), confirming the negative control results. Meanwhile, boiling curves at \u22120.1 and \u22122.0\u2009V for the ionic surfactants (SDS and DTAB) deviated from each other as expected. The boiling curve for SDS at \u22122\u2009V was shifted right compared with the baseline \u22120.1\u2009V curve due to increased wettability and decreased nucleation. The space between the \u22120.1 and \u22122.0\u2009V boiling curves represent the ability to actively control (tune) boiling where the HTC for SDS could be increased up to \u223c1,000% over its minimum value at \u22122.0\u2009V for a given superheat. This HTC increase can be seen in the vertical arrows at 8.7\u2009\u00b0C superheat in Fig. 4c, where the top arrow points to 41\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122 on the \u22120.1\u2009V curve and the bottom arrow to 3.7\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122 on the \u22122.0\u2009V curve. Furthermore, the temperature could be varied >2\u2009\u00b0C; the black horizontal arrows located at 17\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122 in Fig. 4c have a low superheat on the \u22122.0\u2009V curve of 7.5\u2009\u00b0C and a high superheat on the \u22120.1\u2009V curve of 10\u2009\u00b0C. The increase in CHF for SDS at more negative potential (not shown but inferred) is consistent with increased wettability due to surfactants leaving the surface. Conversely, applying a more negative \u22122.0\u2009V to positively charged DTAB decreased wettability to shift the boiling curve left, increase HTC at low q\u2033, but also decrease CHF compared with the baseline \u22120.1\u2009V (Fig. 4d). The HTC for DTAB could be increased from its value at \u22120.1\u2009V up to \u223c1,100% at a given superheat; the vertical arrows at 7\u2009\u00b0C superheat in Fig. 4d have a high heat flux on the \u22122.0\u2009V curve of 20\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122 and a low heat flux on the \u22120.1\u2009V curve of 1.6\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122. The temperature for DTAB could be varied up to nearly 2\u2009\u00b0C by voltage change; horizontal arrows at 3.8\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122 in Fig. 4d show a high superheat on the \u22120.1\u2009V curve of 7.8\u2009\u00b0C and a low superheat on the \u22122.0\u2009V curve of 6.1\u2009\u00b0C. The ability to shift the boiling curve left and right as well as modify CHF enables modulation and optimization of performance for a variety of conditions. For instance in Fig. 4d, the blue curve (\u22122.0\u2009V) is more desirable at lower heat fluxes while the red curve (\u22120.1\u2009V) is more desirable at higher heat fluxes (above the intersection of blue and red curves at 26\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122) owing to its higher CHF. This optimization scheme illustrates the opportunity to develop adaptable boiling devices."

                        "We extended our approach to demonstrate both temporal and spatial control of boiling (Fig. 5) based on our understanding of the mechanism. We fabricated a boiling surface with eight separately addressable gold electrodes insulated from each other, which were heated by platinum resistive heaters underneath (Fig. 5a). With 2.6\u2009mM DTAB, potentials of these electrodes were switched between \u22120.1 and \u22122.0\u2009V. We considered \u22122.0\u2009V the \u2018on' state since positively charged DTAB would adsorb to the surface and increase nucleation compared with the \u22120.1\u2009V \u2018off' state. On the backside of each electrode, a relatively uniform heat flux (constant heater power) of \u223c1.5\u2009W\u2009cm\u22122 was applied across the surface near the onset of bubble nucleation. Figure 5c\u2013j shows our ability to selectively activate bubbles in the area limited to the \u2018on' electrode and completely suppress bubbles at the \u2018off' electrodes with sub-second precision (Supplementary Movies 2 and 3). Gold electrodes were used due to ease of fabrication. However, we believe the phenomenon to be material independent as long as the potentials are in a capacitive charging regime. Limited testing of copper (Supplementary Fig. 6) has also been shown to produce the field-induced tunability effect."

                        "Our current investigation of the parameter space has shown that concentration plays a large role. For instance, a square wave test with a very low concentration of 0.2\u2009mM DTAB has a less pronounced effect than that of 2.6\u2009mM (Supplementary Fig. 7). This is attributed to the fact that the surface adsorption isotherm of surfactants is monotonic; therefore, surface concentrations would be smaller at lower bulk concentrations181925. In addition, lower concentration solutions are more electrically resistive, which would weaken the electric double layer effect (capacitive charging) due to an ohmic drop in the bulk. This ohmic drop may be quite significant as our testing has shown that tunability is dependent on counter electrode placement (more tunability was observed when the counter electrode was closer). The effect of concentration is also corroborated by superheat measurements of sodium decyl sulfate (S10S) at concentrations from 0 to 27\u2009mM (Supplementary Fig. 8), which show that the tunability effect becomes stronger with higher concentrations. As long as the concentration is below the critical micelle concentration when the boiling curve begins to shift right11 (which is the case for all surfactants tested), we expect the field-induced tunability effect to occur."

                "Our work demonstrates that accurate control of boiling is possible, spatially on the scale of a few millimetres and temporally in the sub-second range using charged surfactants with the application of an electric potential. This study focused on attaining the ability to have adaptable boiling devices; thus, attaining maximum performance in HTC or CHF was not the goal of this study. However, since the link between nucleation and wettability is fundamental and this work involves direct manipulation of wettability, our approach should be able to enhance existing high-performance boiling surfaces with structured9 or porous features7. Any surfactants adsorbed or desorbed would change the intrinsic contact angle of rough or structured surfaces; thus, the effect could be magnified by Wenzel's model26. A thorough parametric study of different materials, geometries, surfactants, voltages and concentrations would likely reveal even more optimal configurations. The pH of solutions is not expected to be a large factor since the zeta potential of metals is approximately several tens of millivolts27 and the potentials used here are approximately an order of magnitude higher. Because of this, and the fact that most metals and oxides have similarly low intrinsic contact angles, we do not believe the tunability behaviour is significantly dependent on the choice of material.",
                "A longer term study of overall system robustness would be necessary before electric fields and surfactants can be introduced in real applications. Although in our experiments, no evidence of degradation was observed. No noticeable changes in boiling behaviour were seen during the duration of >10\u2009h of our boiling experiments. Furthermore, no noticeable changes were observed even between experimental runs, which spanned as much as several weeks. Thermal decomposition was likely minimal since surfactants remained well below the thermal decomposition temperatures that are typically in the range of 400\u2009\u00b0C (ref. 28). For applications at elevated pressures near the critical point of water (Tcrit=374\u2009\u00b0C) such as in thermal power plants, surfactants with fluorocarbon tails could be thermally stable up to 600\u2009\u00b0C (ref. 29). Electrically, we did not observe any irreversible charging/discharing; thus, we believe the process to be nearly completely reversible, which is consistent with the electrical capacitor model. Furthermore, the use of electrical fields to move ions in industrial applications is not unprecedented as electrodialysis and capacitive deionization techniques are used for desalination purposes30. Even if degradation or other irreversible effects were appreciable, we believe that periodic replenishment could be a viable option since only very low concentrations of surfactants are required.",
                "The generality of this approach of surfactant boiling with electric fields suggests that this phenomenon could be utilized in a wide variety of applications. Implementation would be relatively easy since no complicated or micro/nanoscale structures need to be fabricated on the surface. Although our spatial control sample was created using microfabrication techniques, these were only used for millimetre-scale patterning of electrodes on the boiling surface or heaters on the backside and not to build structures that affect nucleation. Spatial control would be beneficial in flow boiling applications where the heat transfer performance and stability can be highly sensitive to the location of bubble nucleation31. Overall, temporal control of boiling would be advantageous for non-steady-state applications such as dispatchable power stations, electronics cooling32, distributed power33 or microfluidic actuators34."

These cartridge heaters were powered by a programmable high-power supply (KLP-600-4, Kepco). The top section of the copper block had a narrow 2 \u00d7 2\u2009cm square cross-sectional area and was insulated to provide one-dimensional (1D) conduction. A glass enclosure (for holding the fluid) was placed on top of the silver foil, sealed by an ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber gasket (Fig. 1a).
