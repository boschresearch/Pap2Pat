                        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are rapidly becoming a mainstay of in vitro human cell-based assays for both toxicology and drug discovery. This has been possible due to a slew of advances in the field, which include techniques for high efficiency homologous recombination using transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/cas9 system (Mali et al. Science 2013 339:823-826; Boch et al. Science 2009 326:1509-1512; Urnov et al. Nature 2005 435:646-651; and Moscou, M. J. & Bogdanove, A. J. Science 2009 326:1501), and the ability to make integration-free iPSC cost effectively from normal individuals and patients with monogenic and polygenic diseases. Combined with advances in differentiating iPSC into multiple cell types, this allows the same signaling pathways or the same mutation to be assessed in a common allelic background. The power of this approach has been demonstrated by multiple groups using human cells rather than the standard xeno models used in the past (Han et al. PLoS One 2009 4:e7155; Matsa et al. Science translational medicine 2014 6:239; Peng et al. Journal of biomolecular screening 2013 18:522-533; Sinnecker et al. Journal of cardiovascular translational research 2013 6:31-36). Other groups have used iPSC-based models to identify patients who might adversely respond to an approved drug therapy or discover new drugs to treat a disease (Laustriat et al. Biochemical Society transactions 2010 38: 1051-1057; Sinnecker et al. Pharmacology & therapeutics 2014 143: 246-252; Shtrichman et al. Current molecular medicine 2013 13:792-805; Kumar et al. Neurotoxicology 2012 33:518-529; Ananiev et al. PloS one 2011 6:e25255).",
                        "Although these efforts clearly demonstrate the utility of using iPSC-derived cells for screening and toxicology assays, several issues have constrained the widespread use of such cells. Some of these issues include the time periods required to differentiate iPSC into an appropriate phenotype, the purity of the differentiated cells, and the consistency of the differentiation process. Further constraints include the lack of isogenic lines to control for allelic variability, the difficulty in generating reporter systems, and the time required to select stable subclones for assays (Vojnits, K. & Bremer, S. Toxicology 2010 270:10-17; Fu, X. & Xu, Y. Genome medicine 2012 4:55; Ho et al. Cell transplantation 2012 21: 801-814; Sun et al. Expert review of cardiovascular therapy 2012 10: 943-945; and Tabar, V. & Studer, L. Nature reviews. Genetics 2014 15: 82-92).",
                        "Several groups have begun to develop techniques to address these problems. For example researchers have shown that ZFN, TALEN and CRISPRs/cas9 systems provide efficient gene targeting technologies and allow one to develop safe harbor or lineage specific reporter system (Wang et al. Genome research 2012 22:1316-1326; Holkers et al. Nucleic acids research 2013 41: e63; Luo et al. Stem cells translational medicine 2014 3:821-835; Maggio et al. Scientific reports 2014 4:5105). It has also been shown that it is possible to make GFP and luciferase reporter lines using a standardized targeting system for safe harbor sites where expression is not silenced during differentiation (Luo et al. Stem cells translational medicine 2014 3:821-835)."

                                "As shown herein, these sites can be targeted in multiple iPSC lines to generate reporter systems while retaining pluripotent characteristics. These sites have previously been shown not to be silenced (Luo et al. Stem cells translational medicine 2014 3:821-835; Macarthur et al. Stem cells and development 2012 21:191-205). Different promoters were evaluated and the CMV early enhancer/chicken beta actin (CAG) promoter appeared the most stable and was used for subsequent experiments. Additionally, two different reporters were evaluated: Nanoluc (luciferase) for quantitation and sensitivity, and copGFP for its fluorescence intensity and stability. Both reporters worked efficiently and a subset of the data is shown in FIG. 1.",
                                "The constructs and the schemas of generating knock in (KI) iPSC lines at the two safe harbor sites with the exemplary reporter copGFP driven by the constitutively active CAG promoter are illustrated in FIG. 1A-B. A well-characterized integration-free iPSC line, XCL1, was used as the parental line for all gene-targeting work described herein unless specified otherwise. The Chr 19 site was first targeted and 37 colonies were analyzed for AAVS1-copGFP line by PCR after drug selection and single cell colony cloning. Of these colonies, 12 clones were targeted on one allele and 25 were targeted to both alleles. Similar targeting efficacy was observed for the Chr 13 site. A representative example of a monoallelic (heterozygote) and biallelic (homozygote) is shown in FIG. 1C-D (homozygotes for the AAVS1-copGFP line and heterozygotes for the Chr13-copGFP line). Further sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the successful integration of donor constructs into appropriate genome loci (FIGS. 1C and 1D).",
                                "The reporter lines engineered by each of the safe harbor integration strategies were then validated. Genomic stability of a representative line, the AAVS1-copGFP line was determined. When directly differentiated toward the neural lineage, the copGFP reporter in this KI line was not silenced as evidenced by continuous expression of GFP in nestin-positive neural stem cell (NSC) (FIG. 1E). No gene silencing was observed during random differentiation via embryoid body formation as cells of the three germ layers differentiated from the AAVS1-copGFP line remained GFP-positive.",
                                "To confirm that this safe harbor KI approach can be generalized, similar reporters were created in another well-characterized integration-free line, XCL5 (NCRM5). As an example, a Chr13-Nanoluc-halotag line was generated, similar to the Chr13-copGFP line in which a Nanoluc/HaloTag reporter was used instead of copGFP. This line was differentiated to a pure population of neurons or astrocytes via directed differentiation. Further, no gene silencing in these lineages was confirmed. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate targeting at the safe harbor loci to be both reliable and efficient. The cell lines obtained were stable, karyotypically normal and the reporters did not silence on random or directed differentiations. In addition, both sites could be targeted simultaneously, and both monoallelic and biallelic subclones could be identified.",

                                "While ZFN and TALEN increased targeting efficiency several-fold compared to the traditional gene targeting methods, their efficiency may not be high enough to target non-pluripotent cells. This may be important when the differentiation process is very long or genes have toxic effects at some stages. Accordingly, in the present invention, the safe harbor site targeting strategy was modified by utilizing constructs with multiple Lox sites, which allowed for easy replacement of one reporter or promoter with another by Cre-recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). An nonlimiting example of such a vector design is illustrated in FIG. 2A. In this construct, the CAG promoter driving the copGFP reporter cassette was inserted between lox2272 and lox511 sites with the appropriate orientation for RMCE. In addition, a puromycin resistant gene flanked by two different loxP sites was inserted at the endogenous promoter of AAVS1. Two insulator sites were also added in this line to prevent copGFP silencing. To generate new reporter lines, daughter constructs containing any gene-specific or ubiquitous promoter driving a reporter gene can be inserted between a lox2272 and a lox511 site, and drug selection and loss of the previous insert can be used to identify appropriate clones.",
                                "This strategy was tested by replacing GFP driven by the ubiquitous CAG promoter in the AAVS1-copGFP line with a promoter-reporter construct using the neuronal lineage-specific promoter doublecortin (DCX) driving TagGFP (see FIG. 2) or Nanoluc. In the DCX daughter construct, DCXp-TagGFP, a DCX promoter driving TagGFP together with a PGK promoter driving Neomycin resistant gene was cloned between lox2272 and lox511 sites (see FIG. 2A). In order to induce the RMCE, DCXp-TagGFP construct was co-transfected with a plasmid expressing Cre recombinase by the PGK promoter, into an established AAVS1-copGFP (a homozygote clone) iPSC line. After RCME, colonies that had lost green fluorescence were identified and picked for PCR verifications. Using primers designed specifically for targeting the \u201cparental\u201d and \u201cswap\u201d sequences, iPSC clones were identified where cassette exchange had been successful (see FIG. 2B). Before cassette exchange, the master iPSC line AAVS1-copGFP constitutively expresses green fluorescence and is puromycin resistant. In the presence of Cre recombinase and DCX daughter construct, the puromycin gene was deleted via Cre-loxP mediated recombination, and \u201cCAGp-copGFP\u201d was replaced by the \u201cDCXp-TagGFP-PGKp-Neo\u201d cassette. Thus, the new reporter line, referred to herein as DCXp-TagGFP, is not puromycin but neomycin resistant and is not fluorescent at the iPSC stage (see FIG. 2C).",
                                "To confirm functionally appropriate expression in the DCXp-TagGFP reporter line created by cassette exchange, a directed differentiation protocol was used to induce neuronal differentiation in accordance with procedures described by Yan et al. (Stem cells translational medicine 2013 2:862-870). As the cells differentiated toward the neuronal lineage, GFP-positive cells appeared (see FIG. 2D). ICC staining 6 days after differentiation confirmed that all green cells were specifically located with DCX antibody positive neurons (see FIG. 2D), validating the specificity of the DCXp-TagGFP reporter line.",
                                "To further confirm the utility of the master iPSC line strategy, it was determined whether the RMCE can be extended to intermediate/progenitor stage cells as well. For these experiments, NSC were derived from the AAVS1-copGFP iPSC line, which maintained strong green fluorescence through differentiation (see FIGS. 1E and 2E). Following the same RMCE procedures as described for the iPSC (see FIG. 2A), DCXp-TagGFP daughter construct and Cre-expressing plasmid were co-transfected into AAVS1-copGFP NSC. No drug selection was used to enrich cells with successful RMCE, since the goal for this experiment was not to isolate single clones of NSC with correct cassette exchange. Instead, the entire cell population was analyzed and cells losing green fluorescence post transfection were identified by fluorescence microscopy, indicating the successful event of RMCE (see FIG. 2E). Junction PCR was used to confirm that cassette exchange was indeed correctly induced in a subset of the NSC (see FIG. 2F). Overall these results showed that isogenic subclones can be rapidly generated at multiple stages of differentiation, which should allow expression of deleterious genes at specific stages of development."

                                "Although lineage-specific constructs for some genes are available and some fragments are sufficiently small that they could be targeted to the safe harbor loci (see above DCX-copGFP reporter), a KI strategy in genes that are expressed in specific lineages is desirable as it allows for the development of assays to identify regulators of development. A Nanoluc-HaloTag construct (see FIG. 3) was selected to knock into the endogenous MAP2 locus, and the same reporter construct in endogenous GFAP allele. Monallelic lines were produced and the 3\u2032 prime end of the gene was targeted to allow expression of normal levels of the endogenous gene. Both KI reporter lines were made in the XCL1 iPSC line to show that isogenic subclones could be obtained. Further, the same construct has been used in other NCRM lines. Specifically, ZFN pairs targeting the C-term of GFAP or MAP2 genes were designed and optimized. One pair cutting at \u02dc130 bp after the stop codon of GFAP ORF and ZFNs targeting \u02dc90 bp before the stop codon of MAP2 gene were selected for these experiments (FIGS. 3A and 3B). A donor vector consisting of a reporter cassette of a P2A peptide, a Nanoluc luciferase gene fused with a HaloTag, followed by a neomycin resistance gene was designed to be in frame with the C-terminal of the targeted genes (see FIGS. 3A and 3B). After co-transfection with the donor vector and mRNA of the respective ZFN pair, and appropriate drug selection, 35 colonies from each line were picked for further analysis. Successful insertion of the reporter genes to either GFAP or MAP2 gene was confirmed by both PCR and sequencing analyses for 33 GFAP and 4 MAP2 clones (see FIGS. 3C and 3D). Four clones of each reporter line were selected and verified to be heterozygotes (see FIGS. 3C and 3D). One of each validated GFAP-Nanoluc-KI and MAP2-Nanoluc-KI clone was chosen for further analysis as described below.",
                                "The positive expression of pluripotency markers and a normal karyotype in prolonged culture of both GFAP-Nanoluc-KI and MAP2-Nanoluc-KI iPSC lines were first confirmed. Next neural differentiation was induced via NSC formation from these two iPSC lines and the expression of the reporter genes, Nanoluc and HaloTag, was tracked during lineage-specific differentiation (see FIG. 4). No luciferase signal was detected in GFAP-Nanoluc-KI or MAP2-Nanoluc-KI lines or NSC derived from them (see FIGS. 4A, 4C, 4D and 4F).",
                                "For GFAP-Nanoluc-KI NSC, the expression of luciferase and HaloTag during astrocyte differentiation was monitored using a well-established protocol (Shaltouki et al. Stem cells 2013 31:941-952). Starting from day 18 after the NSC stage, the luminescence intensity increased gradually as the cells differentiated to astrocytes (see FIG. 4A). In order to visualize expression of the reporter gene during differentiation, ligand that covalently binds to HaloTag was used to label live GFAP-Nanoluc-KI cells at different time points during astrocyte differentiation. HaloTag-labeled fluorescent cells were only observed after the differentiation, further confirming that the reporters were turned on specifically by the GFAP promoter as the cells differentiated into astrocytes (see FIG. 4C). The differentiated GFAP-Nanoluc-KI cells (D23 post differentiation) were then tested by immunostaining and co-localization of GFAP and HaloTag antibodies was found in nearly 100% of the cells, indicating that the reporter genes in GFAP-Nanoluc-KI only turned on in the GFAP-positive cells (see FIG. 4B).",
                                "Using a similar strategy, the expression of Nanoluc and HaloTag reporter genes was monitored in the MAP2-Nanoluc-KI cells during neuronal differentiation. A 2-week differentiation protocol was used to generate a pure population of mixed neurons from the NSC (Swistowska et al. Stem cells and development 2010 19:71-82). No detectable luminescence was observed until 12 days post differentiation (see FIG. 4D). No fluorescence was detected from HaloTag expression in MAP2 NSC prior to differentiation (see FIG. 4F). Expression of HaloTag was observed as more and more cells differentiated into neurons (see FIG. 4E). Importantly, HaloTag antibody only stained the MAP2-positive neurons, indicating the specific expression of the reporter from the endogenous MAP2 promoter. These results signify that a single luciferase or HaloTag gene is sufficiently sensitive to allow for live tracking of differentiation events.",
                                "To determine the minimal numbers of cells required for detectable level of Nanoluc, the luminescence level of both GFAP-Nanoluc-KI astrocytes and MAP2-Nanoluc-KI neurons was measured at different cell densities (see FIG. 4G). Less than 1\u00d7104 cells were required for either GFAP-Nanoluc-KI astrocytes or MAP2-Nanoluc-KI neurons to be detected by luminescence in a 96-well format. This result suggested that the GFAP-Nanoluc-KI and MAP2-Nanoluc-KI reporters can be used to effectively and accurately track astrocytes or neurons during differentiation with small numbers of cells and in a high-throughput manner.",
                                "To further demonstrate that clones with multiple reporters can be made rapidly, a stock of NSC was generated from the MAP2-Nanoluc-KI subclone targeting the safe harbor locus at the NSC stage. The targeted clone (the MAP2-Nanoluc-KI line) could be re-targeted and a dual reporter line could be readily generated. Even higher efficiency was obtained when the clone was targeted at the iPSC stage, which was comparable to those seen in an untargeted line.",
                                "Thus, as shown herein, by combining safe harbor gene editing, cassette exchange tools, and the identification of lineage specific gene loci, the present invention provides a useful means for rapidly developing single and multiplexed reporters that provide investigators the ability to develop a repertoire of assays using reporters appropriate for their particular need. Further, the Nanoluc-HaloTag reporter construct disclosed herein offers several advantages. For example, it allows for simultaneous quantitative assessment and fluorescent imaging on demand for time-lapse imaging. By using small molecule ligands to HaloTag, one also has the advantage of choosing fluorescent signals, as its labeling is transient, which allows for other imaging modalities to be used when necessary. In addition, antibodies to the HaloTag are available allowing antibody labeling in fixed cells for archival purposes.",
                                "Further, the limited availability of human cells of the central nervous system make iPSC derived neural derivatives a promising cell source for drug discovery and for improvement of existing drug development workflow, specifically for the evaluation of toxicity and efficacy of lead compounds. Most neural differentiation protocols currently available, however, produce a heterogeneous population of neuron and glial cells, making it difficult to interpret the mechanism of action of a given compound. Using the neural lineage-specific KI reporter approach of the present invention mitigates this problem through use of a donor vector containing dual reporters of luciferase and HaloTag attached to the C-terminal of an endogenous lineage-specific gene. For example, using this approach, the MAP2 gene was targeted for neuron-specific reporter and the GFAP gene was targeted for astrocyte-specific reporter. Lineage-specific expression of the reporters was then validated during lineage-specific differentiation. This MAP2-Nanoluc-KI line allows for real-time monitoring of neuronal differentiation, and the luciferase activity in the culture reflects the percentage of neurons. The non-disruptive assay format enables accurate and quantitative measurement of any compound on neurons specifically. Likewise, the GFAP-Nanoluc-KI line allows for tracking and quantitative measurement of astrocytes in culture. The fact that as few as 104 cells (neurons or astrocytes) from these KI lines were needed to detect the luciferase activity in culture media makes these reporters/assays applicable for high-throughput and high content screening.",
                                "Further, because drug selection is incorporated via a T2A site downstream of the lineage specific promoter in the present invention, it is possible to purify neurons and astrocytes for assays. Likewise, cells can be sorted using the fluorescent label allowing one to combine screening with gene expression analysis.",
                                "In addition, cassette exchange in iPSC and NSCs in accordance with the present invention showed that clones can be rapidly generated in multiple stages of development. While experiments described in detail herein were performed in the neuronal lineage, the platform of the present invention has also been demonstrated to work in mesenchymal stem cells and astrocyte precursors and is expected to work with any other intermediate progenitor as well. The ability to use multiple reporters in the same site for different purposes is an invaluable benefit to having to generate new reporters or new lines and test their specificity and quality each time.",
                                "An additional advantage of the present invention is that the same safe harbors, master and control lines can be used for other lineages. This will allow for development of a database of drug responses and effects of a mutation in a single pathway in multiple cell types from a single allelic background.",
                                "The following nonlimiting examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention."
