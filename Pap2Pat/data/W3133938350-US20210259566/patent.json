    "abstract": "The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for validating a continuously measuring, non-invasive blood pressure measuring system equipped with a plethysmographic system capable of obtaining\u2014in a measuring phase\u2014a plethysmographic signal v(t) at an extremity, having a control mechanism to which the signal v(t) from the plethysmographic system is fed, which varies the contact pressure pC(t) at the extremity via a control value u(t), and having an evaluation unit which continuously determines the arterial blood pressure curve pA(t) based on the resulting contact pressure pC(t). According to the invention, the blood pressure measuring system has a coupling interface via which\u2014in a validation or test phase\u2014a signal derived from a previously recorded blood pressure curve can be input into the blood pressure measuring system.",

                "The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for validating a continuously measuring, non-invasive blood pressure measuring system equipped with a plethysmographic system which is suitable for obtaining a plethysmographic signal at a limb, which is supplied to a control mechanism which varies a contact pressure at the limb, wherein the arterial blood pressure curve is continuously determined based on the contact pressure.",
                "The present invention describes test systems or simulators and the associated validation methods for continuously measuring, non-invasive arterial pressure monitors (Continuous Non-invasive Arterial Pressure CNAP). The measurement methods of CNAP devices are often also referred to as \u201cPe\u0148\u00e1z Principle\u201d, \u201cVascular Unloading Technique\u201d or \u201cVolume Clamp Method\u201d, although newer measurement methods described below go beyond these basic principles.",
                "These CNAP devices detect the blood pressure signal of a living being in real time without the need to insert a catheter into the arterial vascular system. The accuracy of these CNAP devices in comparison to the actual intra-arterial blood pressure has increased enormously in the recent past due to new types of measuring sensors and new methods (algorithms) and it is to be expected that in the future they will be indispensable in daily clinical use. For acceptance in clinical use it will be necessary to check the accuracy at regular intervals. In particular, standardized test systems, simulators and validation methods are necessary for regulatory approval and subsequently for the marketing of new CNAP devices or their algorithms (methods that are mapped in software).",
                "In CNAP systems for continuous blood pressure measurement, the blood pressure signal is recorded at one extremity (usually the finger) using a special procedure and device. The device has signal transducers for the acquisition of a so-called plethysmographic signal (volume signal) v(t) as well as means for changing the contact pressure (counterpressure) pC(t) of the sensor system.",
                "The measurement methods for these continuous CNAP systems essentially function according to the following logic: First, the contact pressure pCo(t) is determined, at which the pulsations in the volume signal v(t) become maximum. According to the so-called \u201coscillometric principle\u201d or \u201cprinciple of maximum amplitude\u201d, the contact pressure pCo(t) at this point corresponds to the mean arterial blood pressure mBP. The search for the maximum pulsations in v(t) and thus for mBP, wherein the contact pressure pC(t) is successively changed, is called \u201copen loop phase\u201d according to the state of the art.",
                "If pCo(t) is found, then the so-called \u201cclosed loop phase\u201d begins. In this actual measurement phase, the CNAP system attempts to continuously maintain the oscillometric principle by means of a closed control loop. Specifically, the contact pressure pC(t) of CNAP follows the natural fluctuations in actual arterial blood pressure pA(t), always maximizing the amplitude of pulsations.",
                "The known CNAP procedures now differ in how it is ensured that the system is at the point of maximum pulsation:",
                "The method for the bloodless determination of blood pressure was presented in 1973 by Jan PENAZ (Digest of the 10th International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering 1973 Dresden). The \u201cVascular Unloading Technique\u201d or \u201cVolume Clamp Method\u201d is therefore also named after its inventor \u201cPe\u0148\u00e1z Principle\u201d. In this method, a finger is transilluminated and a pressure is applied to the finger by means of a servo control in such a way that the originally pulsatile flow registered by the transillumination is kept constant with the aid of an electro-pneumatic control circuit. The \u201cprinciple of maximum amplitude\u201d can be maintained as long as no changes occur due to the smooth vascular muscles (vasomotor function).",
                "This disadvantage was eliminated according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,510,940 A (WESSELIG), wherein the \u201cclosed loop phase\u201d is regularly interrupted. In the following \u201copen loop phase\u201d a new short search for the maximum amplitudes according to given criteria is performed.",
                "Both PENAZ and WESSELING use only one control loop for their method, which is to correct all disturbance variables. U.S. Pat. No. 8,114,025 B2 (FORTIN) describes a new CNAP method in which interlocking concentric control loops are each responsible for a specific disturbance variable. In U.S. Pat. No. 8,814,800 B2 (FORTIN), the \u201cprinciple of maximum amplitude\u201d is further improved; after each heartbeat the correctness of the principle is checked by using a special property of the pulse shape to correct the operating point.",
                "In U.S. Pat. No. 10,098,554 B2 (FORTIN), a new CNAP principle is described, which differs from the simple \u201cVolume Clamp Method\u201d: the contact pressure pC(t) no longer has a pulsatile effect on the extremity, but only follows slowly the changes of the mean arterial blood pressure mBP. The pulsatile nature of the continuous blood pressure curve is obtained from the pulsatile plethysmographic signal v(t). In WO 2016/110781, a variant of a portable blood pressure monitoring system (CNAP-2-GO) is described.",
                "For all known systems, it is true that they only work if an extremity (e.g. the finger) of a living being is brought into contact with the measuring sensors.",
                "It is the object of the invention to improve a method and an apparatus for validating a continuously measuring, non-invasive blood pressure measuring system in such a way that no extremity (for example a finger) needs to be brought into contact with the device for the validation of the blood pressure measuring system.",
                "According to the invention, this is achieved by\u2014in a validation or test phase\u2014feeding a signal derived from a previously recorded blood pressure curve into the blood pressure measuring system via a coupling interface.",
                "Advantageous variants of the validation method according to the invention are set out in the dependent method claims 2 to 10.",
                "An apparatus according to the invention for the validation of a continuously measuring, non-invasive blood pressure measuring system equipped with a plethysmographic system which is suitable\u2014in a measuring phase\u2014for obtaining a plethysmographic signal v(t) at an extremity is characterized in that the blood pressure measuring system has a coupling interface via which\u2014in a validation or test phase\u2014a signal derived from a previously recorded blood pressure curve can be input into the blood pressure measuring system.",
                "Advantageous variants of the apparatus according to the invention are set out in dependent claims 12 to 15.",
                "The apparatus and method according to the invention are fundamentally different from known test systems used for the validation of, for example, intermittent blood pressure monitors. These intermittent blood pressure monitors usually measure the currently occurring blood pressure on the upper arm or wrist in a spot measurement without displaying the continuous curve. The cuff is inflated above the systolic blood pressure value and then the pressure is slowly released. Exactly one systolic, mean or diastolic value is obtained per inflation, which usually takes up to one minute. The evaluation procedures of intermittent blood pressure measurement methods are usually the auscultatory procedure according to Riva-Rocci (1896)/Korotkow (1905), in which the sounds in the crook of the arm are listened to with a stethoscope, or the oscillometric procedure, which is often used in automatically functioning devices.",
                "In literature, test systems for intermittent blood pressure monitors are described in which the oscillometric pulses or \u201cKorotkow tones\u201d are artificially brought into the blood pressure monitor to be tested in order to enable the measurement of a given blood pressure value. These test systems cannot be used for continuously measuring CNAP systems; they cannot close the control loop necessary for these CNAP systems nor can they simulate the physiological characteristics of the extremity (e.g. fingers).",
                "The initially described methods of the state of the art have one thing in common: in the \u201cclosed loop phase\u201d, the closed CNAP control system attempts to keep the volume changes v(t) or, according to U.S. Pat. No. 10,098,554 B2, specific frequency contents of v(t) (referred to as vF(t)) constant by changing the contact pressure pC(t). As will be described in detail later, v(t) or certain frequency contents vF(t) indicate how large the deviation between the actual contact pressure pC(t) and the actual arterial blood pressure pA(t) is, since the deviations pC(t)-pA(t) also result in volume changes. In the language of system and control engineering, v(t) or vF(t) corresponds to the control deviation, also known as error signal e(t). If the control deviation e(t) is sufficiently small, pA(t) can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy from pC(t)\u2014of course without having to determine pA(t) using an invasive catheter, which is the great advantage of these CNAP systems. With the newer methods according to U.S. Pat. No. 10,098,554 B2 and WO 2016/110781 A1, further frequency contents of v(t) are required in addition to pC(t) for the determination of pulsatile pA(t).",
                "A further essential feature of all CNAP systems is the fact that the comparative element of the controlled system\u2014i.e. the place where the \u201creference variable\u201d pA(t) is compared with the \u201ccontrolled variable\u201d pC(t)\u2014is located in the body or in the extremity of the living organism. From a control engineering point of view it is irrelevant where the so-called \u201ccomparator\u201d is located. In practice, however, this means that a conventional CNAP system only works if an extremity or finger of a living being is available\u2014i.e. even if the CNAP system is to be tested or validated.",
                "The CNAP system therefore does not have the exact reference variable\u2014i.e. the actual arterial blood pressure pA(t)\u2014at its disposal. It only receives the plethysmographic information, i.e. a signal corresponding to the changes in the volume v(t) of the artery. This information is usually obtained by a light procedure, in which a light source (e.g. LED) is attached to one side of the extremity (e.g. finger) and the transmitted signal is measured on the other side (e.g. using a photodiode). With all known systems, the light source emits a light with constant luminous intensity, or in most cases constant, rectangular light pulses are used. The use of light pulses allows on the one hand a higher energy density with reduced energy expenditure and on the other hand allows the detection of ambient light during the so-called blanking interval. Light systems for CNAP devices are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 8,343,062 B2 (FORTIN).",
                "Until now, the reference variable pA(t) could only be brought into a CNAP system if an extremity (e.g. finger) of a living being was present. Logically, only the current blood pressure of the test person can be measured. For regulatory reasons, this is a major disadvantage, as it means that no standardized, repeatable test measurements can be performed. Systematic examinations of the CNAP system are thus not possible. In contrast to other biomedical systems such as the ECG or the test systems for intermittent blood pressure monitors mentioned above, it is not possible to record signals once and test them repeatedly. Problematic blood pressure curves such as blood pressure drops during operations, asystole during tilting table examinations, changes during different pacemaker settings, etc. cannot be reproduced. Changes to the CNAP system must be validated for regulatory reasons. According to the state of the art, this is only possible by repeated test measurements on the patient in the clinic. Since such problematic blood pressure curves are unpredictable, measurements on a large number of patients are necessary to obtain statistically significant results.",
                "The present invention now enables standardized validation measurements to be carried out. In the following, several embodiment variants of apparatuses and methods for the validation of CNAP systems are described.",
                "A basic method of feeding the previously recorded blood pressure curve as a reference variable pA(t) is done by modulating the light, specifically by modulating the LED light pulses. With the apparatus according to the invention, the CNAP system can no longer distinguish whether the resulting light signal v(t) on the receiving side was generated by a simulation module of the apparatus or whether the modulation originates from a finger of a person. The CNAP system subsequently generates a contact pressure pC(t) via the described control system from which the arterial blood pressure pA(t) to be determined can be derived. The controlled variable pC(t) is in turn fed into the simulation module and compared with the continuing recorded reference variable pA(t). A new v(t) is generated and again fed into the system via modulation of the light and the control loop is closed.",
                "This makes it possible that a clinically recorded blood pressure curve\u2014more precisely, a patient's blood pressure signal once recorded\u2014can be fed into the CNAP system under test. The resulting measurement signal can then be compared with the input signal. It is irrelevant whether the patient signal originates from an intra-arterial catheter or from a CNAP device used during the clinical measurement.",
                "The invention further describes validation methods of CNAP systems which can be performed with the present test system or simulator as well as methods which can prove an equivalence of already approved CNAP systems with new, modified systems.",
                "FIG. 1 shows a state-of-the-art blood pressure measuring system 102 which uses the following control techniques for continuous non-invasive CNAP methods to determine the blood pressure signal pA(t): A plethysmographic system 103, 104, for example in the form of a finger cuff 105, is attached to an extremity 101 or a body part of a living being in which an artery A is located\u2014such as the finger 101, a wrist or temple\u2014and thus illuminated by means of a light source 103. The light that flows through this extremity 101 or is reflected by the bone lying in the extremity (e.g. carpal, temple) is registered by a suitable light detector 104 and is an inverse measure of the arterial blood volume in the extremity (plethysmographic signal v(t)). The more blood there is in the extremity, the more light is absorbed and the smaller the plethysmographic signal v(t).",
                "The signal v(t) is now fed to a control mechanism 106 and a control value u(t) is determined, which subsequently changes the contact pressure pC(t) at the extremity 101 generated by a pressure generating unit 108. The contact pressure pC(t) acts at that point where the plethysmographic signal v(t) is also determined. The condition of the control mechanism determines that v(t) or certain frequency contents of v(t) (referred to as vF(t)) are kept constant by the applied contact pressure pC(t). If v(t) thus wants to change, then the control mechanism 106 adjusts the pressure pC(t) via the control value u(t) in such a way that v(t) remains constant.",
                "If this control condition is met\u2014i.e. v(t) and thus the blood volume in the extremity 101 remains constant over time\u2014the pressure difference between the intra-arterial pressure pA(t) and the external contact pressure pC(t)\u2014the so-called transmural pressure pT(t)\u2014is zero. Thus the contact pressure pC(t) corresponds to the intra-arterial pressure pA(t) in the extremity. This contact pressure pC(t) provided by the pressure generation unit 108 can be measured by means of a pressure sensor or manometer.",
                "An essential component, namely the comparator of the controlled system is located inside the extremity (e.g. fingers). The so-called comparator is the comparison element in which the \u201creference variable\u201d pA(t) is compared with the \u201ccontrolled variable\u201d pC(t). If pA(t) changes compared to pC(t), volume fluctuations occur which are recorded via the plethysmographic signal v(t).",
                "The control loop according to FIG. 1 therefore only functions if the human comparator\u2014i.e. the extremity 101 or the finger\u2014is also introduced into the CNAP system. This human comparator in the form of a test person\u2014or more precisely, the comparator function\u2014had to be present in the past when the devices were tested or validated. The current blood pressure in the artery of the test person pA(t) is thus compared with the contact pressure pC(t) and the basic comparator function",
                "v(t)=f(pC(t)\u2212pA(t))\u2003\u2003(1)",
                "is generated. The current blood pressure in the artery pA(t) is also not directly available to the CNAP system, which is the advantage of this non-invasive CNAP system. However, in comparison to other test systems, such as for ECG or the test systems for intermittent blood pressure monitors mentioned above, it is not possible to simply introduce a biological signal at a measuring sensor and thus have the device under test generate a measured value. The biological signal available to a CNAP system is directly influenced and changed by the measuring method or the contact pressure pC(t).",
                "For the verification, testing and validation of CNAP systems, it is advantageous if the comparator function can be made available in a standardized way, which is described in the following using embodiment variants of validation methods and validation apparatuses.",
                "FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of the validation apparatus according to the invention. Instead of the extremity or finger, a simple finger dummy 201 is in contact with the plethysmographic system 203, 204. The plethysmographic signal v(t) is generated by the light source 203 and a light sensor 204. The signal v(t) is fed to the control mechanism 206 and a control value u(t) is determined, which subsequently changes a contact pressure pC(t).",
                "In this embodiment variant, care is taken to ensure that the same CNAP components are active as those used in accordance with the state of the art in FIG. 1. This is necessary for the validation proof described later. Ideally, the CNAP devices are designed in such a way that they are put into simulator mode and can thus virtually validate themselves. Thus the components of the blood pressure monitor 202 in FIG. 2 correspond to those of the blood pressure monitor 102 in FIG. 1; the light source 203 corresponds to the light source 103, etc. The supplementary system components are explained as follows in accordance with FIG. 2:",
                "The finger dummy 201 is primarily responsible for ensuring that the contact pressure pC(t) provided by the pressure generation unit 208 can actually occur in the blood pressure measuring system 202 by the contact pressure pC(t) meeting a counterpart. The contact pressure pC(t) is often generated by means of an inflatable finger cuff 205, this cuff could even burst if there is no counterpart.",
                "Furthermore, the finger dummy 201 should have similar haptic properties as an actual finger. Especially the viscosity properties shall be simulated, e.g. by using a gel or gelatine as material for the finger dummy 201, which is surrounded by an elastic skin. This is advantageous for simulating the coupling of the light source 203 and light sensors 204.",
                "The finger dummy 201 preferably has similar optical characteristics as an actual finger of a living being. For example, the absorption constant of the finger dummy 201 is chosen for the light wavelength occurring in the light source 203 as it occurs in a finger that is pressed down with a contact pressure pC(t) above the systolic blood pressure. The amount of light that is transmitted through a finger that is squeezed via the systolic blood pressure should at least also be able to be transmitted through the finger dummy 201, but not significantly more.",
                "The finger dummy 201 thus meets minimum haptic and optical requirements; however, in contrast to an actual finger, it does not have to modulate the light signal in order to bring the information about the arterial blood pressure curve pA(t) into the CNAP system.",
                "According to the invention, this is supposed to work by modulating the light source 203. In the measurement phase as shown in FIG. 1, light source 103 is always lit at constant light energy. It shall now be possible to change or modulate this light energy in a validation or test phase via a coupling interface 209. The light modulated in this way now flows through the finger dummy 201 and hits the light sensor 204, which receives the light regardless of whether the light modulations are caused by changes in the absorption in a finger or by modulations of the light intensity in the light source 203. The resulting signal v(t) is then fed to the control mechanism 206, which determines a control value u(t), and the contact pressure pC(t) is changed, which in turn acts on the finger dummy 201.",
                "Now the comparison element or comparator required for each control system is still missing, in which the reference variable pA(t) is compared with the controlled variable pC(t). A simulation module 210 is provided for this purpose, which receives as input parameters the contact pressure pC(t) of the blood pressure measuring system 202 on the one hand, and a blood pressure curve pA(t) previously recorded on a storage medium 211 on the other hand. The simulation module 210 calculates the plethysmographic signal v(t) according to equation (1)\u2014the so-called comparator function of the simulation module 210\u2014and feeds it to the coupling interface 209 to ensure the modulation of the light in the light source 203.",
                "FIGS. 3a and 3b show the changes in the control of light source 103 (FIG. 1: Measurement phase or state of the art) and 203 (FIG. 2: Validation phase of the invention), respectively, wherein LEDs are preferably used as light sources 103, 203. It is known that the signal yield of an LED is better if the LED is controlled with electronic pulses. It is possible to generate higher LED currents for a short time, although the total energy consumption of the LED is reduced. The information about the switch-on times of the pulses is transmitted to the light receiver 104, 204. FIG. 3a shows such electronic control pulses during the measuring phase. There are only control pulses which either switch the light source 103 on completely (state 1) or switch it off (state 0).",
                "FIG. 3b now shows how the energy of the switch-on pulses can be modulated. In order for the complete information of a blood pressure curve to be modulated and thus transmitted to the CNAP system via the light source 203, the height of the electronic pulse should be equipped with a minimum of 12 bit coding up to a maximum of approx. 16 bit coding. According to the invention, all other encodings are also possible.",
                "FIGS. 4a and 4b show a typical pressure-volume diagram (p-v diagram). This information is necessary to determine the function from equation (1) and thus describe the comparator function of simulation module 210 in further detail below. The p-v diagram is usually determined in the open-loop phase, i.e. at the beginning of each measurement, where the \u201coscillometric principle\u201d or the \u201cprinciple of maximum amplitude\u201d is used to search for the maximum pulsations and thus for the mean arterial blood pressure mBP.",
                "FIG. 4a shows that at the point:",
                "v(t)=maximum pulsations/contact pressure pCo(t)=mBP",
                "the operating point (setpoint) was found. For this purpose, the contact pressure pC(t)\u2014in this example using a ramp function\u2014was changed and the corresponding plethysmographic signal v(t) was determined. It can be seen that v(t) has a pulsatile component as well as a kind of \u201cconstant component\u201d. The pulsatile component is caused by the arterial blood pressure fluctuations and its frequency naturally corresponds to the heart rate. The so-called constant component, on the other hand, is caused by the absorption of light by bones, skin, tissue, venous blood, interstitial fluid and also by the degree of filling of the artery or arteries. The venous blood and the interstitial fluid can be displaced by the contact pressure pC(t), therefore the constant component of these components changes with the contact pressure pC(t). The constant component also changes significantly with the compression of the artery or arteries in the extremity, such as the finger.",
                "To determine the pulsatile component from v(t), the signal is filtered with a high-pass filter. Mathematically speaking, this process corresponds to the determination of the first derivative after time. As the pressure pC(t) increases, the amplitudes of the pulses first increase, only to become smaller again from a certain pressure\u2014as described above from the mean arterial blood pressure mBP or at the point pCo(t). The amplitudes of the pulses behave according to a bell curve. A typical picture of the \u201coscillometric envelope\u201d, as is also known from automatic intermittent blood pressure monitors, emerges.",
                "The constant component is smallest at low contact pressure pC(t), because the light is absorbed not only by bones, skin and tissue, venous blood and interstitial fluid, but also to a large extent by arterial blood, which\u2014averaged over the pulsations\u2014is located in the artery. With increasing pressure, the constant component also increases and at a contact pressure pC(t) far above the systolic blood pressure sBP, the arterial blood is completely displaced from the artery and saturation occurs. The light is only absorbed by bone, skin and tissue. The constant component reaches a maximum.",
                "FIG. 4b shows the same p-v diagram in more detail. The constant component of v(t) has been determined and you can see that it corresponds to an S-curve. This S-curve shaped constant component can also be determined by mathematically integrating the bell-shaped \u201coscillometric envelope\u201d. The maximum slope of the S-curve cmax corresponds to the maximum amplitude or height of the bell curve.",
                "The comparator function sought for the finger essentially corresponds to the S-curve shape of the constant component. The first derivative of this comparator function also corresponds to the oscillometric bell curve from the distribution of the pulse amplitudes. As shown in FIG. 4b, the extreme values Vmin (constant component if pC(t)=0) and Vmax (constant component if pC(t)>>sBP) and the operating point at V0/pCo(t)=mBP can be used to parameterize the S-curve in a present embodiment variant of the comparator function. The gradient at the point of the operating point corresponds to cmax according to FIG. 4b.",

                "According to the invention, other S-curve-shaped functions can also be used, such as the Areasinus hyperbolicus (arsinh) or the Gaussian distribution or sum function \u03a6, which can be applied in suitable variants of these functions.",
                "In further embodiment variants, the comparator function can be determined from other mathematical methods. For example, the measurement of the v(t) amplitudes at different contact pressures pC(t) is useful, wherein these v(t) amplitudes can then serve as support points for any kind of empirical function. The different v(t) amplitudes at different contact pressures pC(t) can be determined in an open loop phase at the beginning of the measurement.",
                "Experiments have shown that it is also advantageous to map other physiological properties of the comparator function. As described above, the constant component of v(t) is also dependent on the venous blood and the interstitial fluid, because both components are also dependent on the contact pressure pC(t). The proportion of venous blood disappears relatively quickly when the contact pressure rises above the venous blood pressure\u2014i.e. to pC(t)>>20 mmHg\u2014where the operating pressure of CNAP devices usually lies.",
                "The case is different with the proportion of interstitial fluid. Firstly, pulsatile changes in pC(t) cause a constant squeezing out and sucking in of interstitial fluid into the measuring finger. This has such an effect on v(t) that a hysteresis is formed.",
                "This hysteresis can be represented mathematically as follows:",
                "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{v_{hys}(t)} = {{v(t)} - {c_{hys} \\cdot {k(t)} \\cdot \\frac{d\\left( {{p_{C}(t)} - {p_{A}(t)}} \\right)}{dt}}}} & (4)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                "where vhys(t) is the plethysmographic signal subject to hysteresis and chys is a constant characteristic of the hysteresis. v(t) is the plethysmographic signal determined from one of the methods described above; k(t) is the first derivative dv(t)/dt.",
                "Secondly, experience shows that it takes up to five minutes for the interstitial fluid to be pressed out of the finger until a stable equilibrium is achieved. As long as the constant component drifts due to the interstitial liquid component, a kind of parallel shift of the S-curve comparator function occurs. Such \u201cfluid shifts\u201d can also occur again and again during operation, e.g. by repositioning the measuring finger or after the patient has taken in fluid by drinking, but also by infusions. It is therefore advantageous to re-measure the S-curve or its parameters at regular intervals. Vasomotor activity also influences the S-curve comparator function, which makes it useful to check and, if necessary, correct it.",
                "For checking and, optionally, correcting the comparator function during operation, it is conceivable to determine v(t) amplitudes at different contact pressures pC(t) in a short open-loop phase, but also evaluation sequences during the closed-loop phase.",
                "If the S-curve comparator function is present and this is also checked regularly and optionally corrected according to an embodiment variant, the control loop of the present simulator can be closed as described in FIG. 2. This control loop is summarized as follows: an arterial blood pressure curve pA(t) is stored on a storage medium 211. This is read out and fed to simulation module 210 in the correct time sequence, in which the S-curve comparator function is mapped. Furthermore, the contact pressure pC(t) is an input variable of the simulation module 210. The output signal of the simulation module 210 is the plethysmographic signal v(t), with which the light source 203 is now modulated. The light flows through the finger dummy 201 and hits the light sensor 204. Said light sensor 204 cannot distinguish whether the signal v(t) arriving at it was modulated by absorption in a finger or by the simulation module. The signal v(t) is fed to the control mechanism 206, which determines the manipulated variable u(t) and subsequently changes the contact pressure pC(t)\u2014which in turn acts on the finger dummy 201. The signal pC(t) is also fed to the simulation module 210, where it is again compared with the arterial blood pressure curve pA(t) on the storage medium 211.",
                "Nota bene: the simulation module 210 of these embodiment variants generates analog signals: both the light is modulated and thus generates a signal v(t), and the contact pressure pC(t) in the blood pressure measuring system 202, for example in the finger cuff 205, is also effective.",
                "In other embodiment variants, the control loop can also be digitally reproduced on a computer. In this case, certain electronic elements such as the plethysmographic system 203, 204 or the means for changing the contact pressure pC(t) must be reproduced digitally. This has the advantage that other important digital elements such as the control mechanism 206, which is mainly in the form of an algorithm in software codes, can be easily tested on a computer.",
                "FIGS. 5a to 5d describe possible methods for validation. It must first be mentioned that the test systems and simulators described here can only be used efficiently for validation purposes if the functionality of the test systems and simulators can also be validated. It must be demonstrated that the systems function with sufficient accuracy.",
                "For medical devices in general and for blood pressure monitors in particular, standards apply which have defined tolerance limits. These tolerance limits must be met by new devices compared to gold standard methods when they are introduced to the market. For example, intermittent blood pressure monitors have an average difference to the gold standard of 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of 8 mmHg. A separate standard for continuous blood pressure monitors is currently being developed.",
                "In order to prove that the test system at hand also complies with this standard and the tolerance limit, the following procedure could be applied: During the recording of a blood pressure curve, which can later also be imported into a CNAP simulator system, the true intra-arterial blood pressure (IBP) should be recorded simultaneously by means of a catheter (gold standard) and a non-invasive blood pressure curve (CNAP). Ideally, blood pressure curves should not only be recorded for one patient, but for a certain number of patients, as specified in the standard. From the statistical evaluation, a deviation between CNAP and the gold-standard IBP is obtained, which ideally lies within the prescribed tolerance limit.",
                "Exactly this CNAP system used for recording, including all associated components, is now being converted into a simulator. The comparator function of the respective patient is imported into simulation module 210 and with the corresponding IBP the first simulator recording is generated, designated in FIGS. 5a-d as \u201c1st SIMU\u201d. This is done for all patient files and a data set of 1st SIMUs is created. This dataset can now be compared with both the IBP dataset and the CNAP dataset. The sum of the datasets to each other must\u2014as shown in FIG. 5a\u2014be within a tolerance triangle with the side length \u201cMax Limit\u201d, wherein \u201cMax Limit\u201d describes the tolerance limit prescribed in a standard. FIG. 5b shows an illustration for an acceptable, validated simulator system that is within the tolerance triangle. All three data sets\u2014IBP (gold standard), CNAP and 1st SIMU\u2014have differences between them that are within the tolerance limits. This is not the case in FIG. 5c, where, for example, the difference between IBP and 1st SIMU is too large.",
                "Although the exact same CNAP components (sensors, light system, control system, contact pressure device, etc.) are used for the first simulations, the 1st SIMU blood pressure curve will not be completely equivalent to the CNAP curve. This is because the comparator function of the simulation module 210 was of course only simulated. The better the CNAP and 1st SIMU correlate, the more accurate the S-curve comparator function was simulated.",
                "However, the test system is not built to subsequently test the same CNAP components. FIG. 5d now shows how new CNAP systems or subsystems can be tested and, above all, which tolerance limits must be observed for validations. If a new data set with new CNAP components is created by importing IBP as the gold standard into the simulator with the new CNAP components, the new data system must have differences within the tolerance limits for all three data sets\u2014IBP (gold standard), CNAP and 1st SIMU. In other words, the new SIMU data set must lie within a tetrahedron which, according to FIG. 5d, spans the \u201ctolerance triangle\u201d with the side length \u201cMax. Limit\u201d known from FIG. 5a."
