    "title": "A novel art of continuous noninvasive blood pressure measurement",
    "date": "2021-03-02",
    "abstract": "Wearable sensors to continuously measure blood pressure and derived cardiovascular variables have the potential to revolutionize patient monitoring. Current wearable methods analyzing time components (e.g., pulse transit time) still lack clinical accuracy, whereas existing technologies for direct blood pressure measurement are too bulky. Here we present an innovative art of continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring (CNAP2GO). It directly measures blood pressure by using a volume control technique and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger-ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent blood pressure measurement performance in comparison with invasive reference measurements in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile blood pressure signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can self-calibrate and be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.",

                "The digital revolution is about to bring innovations to physiologic monitoring1. Innovative wearable sensors for monitoring of cardiovascular dynamics have the potential to revolutionize the monitoring of vital signs and their response to therapy in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings. Continuous real-time monitoring of cardiovascular dynamics\u2014including arterial blood pressure (BP) and advanced hemodynamic variables that are derived from its waveform (stroke volume, cardiac output (CO), and dynamic cardiac preload variables)\u2014is a mainstay of patient care in perioperative and intensive care medicine but, for the most part, still requires invasive or stationary noninvasive sensors2,3. With the availability of noninvasive and wearable sensors, advanced cardiovascular monitoring may become part of patient surveillance on normal wards4 and even outside the hospital5. Upgrading patient monitoring capabilities with wearable solutions designed for normal wards may help avoid intensive care unit overload (as seen during the COVID-19 crisis)6.",
                "For these clinical applications, wearable sensors have to fulfill all regulatory and clinical demands of medical-grade devices\u2014just as their stationary counterparts. Challenges for future developments in the field of wearable miniaturized monitoring sensors will be to provide measurements with clinically acceptable accuracy, precision, and reliability and to ensure clinical usability and patient safety. Ideally, miniaturized monitoring sensors measure in the background without user interaction. At the moment, wearable sensors for continuous BP monitoring still show poor measurement performance7 and have, therefore, not been adopted into clinical practice.",
                "Most current wearable BP monitoring systems estimate BP based on\u00a0time information. Pulse time interval or pulse velocity methods use a proximal and a distal sensor for the measurement of the pulse transit time or pulse arrival time8. Other time-based methods for BP estimation use sensors that decompose the pulse into a forward and a backward wave to analyze their time differences9,10. There are also attempts to use photo-plethysmographic (PPG)11 or piezoelectric12 pulse detection for the estimation of BP based on amplitude and time information. However, a direct translation of the pulse signal\u2014which is a surrogate for volume changes\u2014into continuous BP is challenging because of confounding effects of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomic nervous systems. By enhancing model complexity (e.g., using machine learning and neural network tools), the measurement performance of these approaches may be improved11,13,14. Although their sensor hardware is very simple, significant work is still needed to achieve clinically acceptable performance8,11,15,16. The difficulty with time-based approaches for wearable BP measurement devices seems to be that the variables of the mathematical models need to change along with changes in vasomotor activity of the vascular smooth muscles which are determined by the autonomic nervous system. All of these cuff-less attempts of continuous BP monitoring require frequent re-calibration, for example using cuff-based sphygmomanometers, rendering them unfeasible for wearable wireless monitoring17,18.",
                "Other wearable approaches based on the oscillometric principle provide BP values intermittently. For example, the HeartGuide (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) is a wrist-worn watch-type oscillometric BP monitoring device19. Another innovative approach measures oscillometric curves by pressing a finger on a cell phone screen20,21. While this research shows that oscillometric BP measurement at the finger is feasible, these methods need user interaction (keeping the sensor at heart level or pressing a finger on the screen) and automated continuous BP monitoring (including monitoring during night sleep) is not possible.",
                "Stationary finger cuff devices have been successfully introduced for direct continuous noninvasive BP monitoring in various medical fields, especially in critical care and anesthesiology22. These devices are based on the vascular unloading technique (VUT), also referred to as volume clamp or Pe\u0148\u00e1z method23\u201325. The VUT measures BP and derives the complete pulsatile BP waveform by controlling fast inflation and deflation of a finger cuff in combination with PPG. As with time-based technologies, the VUT is influenced by changes in vasomotor activity; different devices have found differing methods to detect and compensate for changes in vasomotor tone26\u201328. VUT devices do not necessarily need calibration for proper functioning. Instead, the Finapres (Ohmeda Monitoring Systems, Englewood, CO, USA) and successor devices use a heart level sensor and/or a transfer function to provide estimates of brachial BP values29,30. CNAP devices (CNSystems Medizintechnik, Graz, Austria) have a different approach: they routinely use an upper arm cuff for orthostatic/heart level correction and for calibration to brachial BP level31. A transfer function approach is also used as a temporary correction until the calibration is performed or if the user does not want to use the upper arm cuff.",
                "Existing VUT systems are, however, too bulky to be used for wearable monitoring devices because the systems consist of mechanical elements like pumps, valves, and air hoses to follow the pulsatile nature of BP with high fidelity.",
                "It was generally believed that, for correct BP measurement based on VUT, a constant (or clamped) blood volume in the finger over the complete period of pulsation and therefore full vascular unloading of the blood vessels is essential. Whether this is indeed physiologically or metrologically necessary was never examined.",
                "The basic idea behind our novel art of continuous noninvasive BP measurement, CNAP2GO, is to perform the blood volume control substantially more\u00a0slowly to be able to use slow-moving and, therefore, small-scaled hardware. Most importantly, such hardware requires neither a pump nor a valve. The basic principle of the CNAP2GO method is the volume control technique (VCT). In contrast to the VUT, which keeps the blood volume in the finger artery constant on a millisecond basis to accurately follow the full cardiac cycle, the VCT keeps the volume constant on a time scale of heartbeats. Blood volume is allowed to oscillate over heartbeats, balancing inflow and outflow of blood in the finger artery over each heart cycle. Controlling blood volume by VCT without fast oscillations poses a non-trivial control engineering problem, which is solved using a set of signal processing algorithms. Most importantly, as we will demonstrate, this method is resistant to changes in vasomotor tone.",
                "In this paper, we first describe the elements of CNAP2GO and how they interact to derive a continuous BP waveform from the directly measured mean BP (mBP) and the PPG signal. We show that the BP waveform can be used to estimate advanced hemodynamic variables. The VCT was implemented in software and placed on the hardware of an existing VUT-device that emulates slow VCT. The accuracy of the CNAP2GO software prototype was clinically validated in comparison with invasive BP measurements obtained using a radial arterial catheter in patients having surgery with general anesthesia. The CNAP2GO method can, in the future, be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger-ring utilizing a light transmitter (LED) and a receiver (photodiode). The contact pressure of LED and photodiode can be modified by an actuator changing the ring diameter with a rate-of-change as fast (or rather: as slow) as mBP.",
                "A wearable approach of an actuator is demonstrated and its feasibility is shown. This actuator is able to produce a typical oscillometric curve measurement including its envelope derived from the PPG signal v(t), which is the basis for VCT. Using this envelope, the method can automatically self-calibrate to oscillometric systolic BP (sBP) and diastolic BP (dBP). For a clinically meaningful continuous BP signal, an integrated heart level sensor utilizing an electronic XYZ-axis accelerometer and gyroscope in addition to a suitable transfer function will be applied. As user interaction is not required, CNAP2GO may be used in a broad range of medical applications."

                        "The CNAP2GO sensor is a PPG probe which comprises an LED and a photodiode. The contact pressure of these light elements to the skin can be modified. Even simple PPG probes (e.g., pulsoxymeter) have elements that couple the light components to the body with pressure: this is usually a spring, Velcro, or another simple clamp mechanism. A constant pressure (around 20\u201330\u2009mmHg) ensures good light coupling. Within CNAP2GO, a simple actuator can vary the contact pressure of the light elements as fast as mBP may change (Fig.\u00a01). As a consequence, the system wins an additional degree of freedom which is needed for continuous BP measurement as it can determine the oscillometric curve.Fig. 1Actuator within CNAP2GO.Within CNAP2GO, the element for constant pressure coupling is a simple, slow-moving actuator that can vary the contact pressure p(t) of the light elements (light-emitting diode and photodiode) as fast as mean blood pressure may change. v(t): light signal.",
                        "The basic idea of varying contact pressure is also implemented in all existing devices based on the VUT. When using the VUT, the speed and amplitude of the changes in contact pressure must match pulsatile arterial BP, requiring pressure changes of 30\u2013100\u2009mmHg per systolic upstroke of the beat to ensure high-fidelity pressure waveforms. For example, the pressure system of the CNAP devices can apply pressure changes with more than 1500\u2009mmHg/s."

Figure\u00a02 shows the block diagram and the signal flow of CNAP2GO. An LED-light (\u03bb\u2009=\u2009890\u2009nm) is directed through a finger and light absorption is measured by a photodiode with corresponding wavelength characteristics. The resulting PPG signal v(t) is an inverse surrogate for blood volume changes inside the finger artery: Rising blood volume increases absorption and therefore decreases the amount of light transmitted through the finger.Fig. 2Block diagram and signal flow of CNAP2GO.An LED-light is directed through a finger and its absorption is measured by a photodiode depending on arterial pressure pa(t).

                        "Closing the CNAP2GO control loop requires an initial open-loop phase to determine the initial value of mBP by altering the contact pressure and detecting the corresponding PPG pulse-amplitudes from the signal vPulse(t). Figure\u00a03 shows how a typical oscillometric curve including its envelope is obtained. Figure\u00a03a shows the resulting v(t) when a pressure ramp pc(t) is applied. The p-v transfer function corresponds to an S-shaped arcus tangent with superimposed pulses32. The upper asymptote of v(t), where pc(t) is far above sBP, corresponds to the maximum light that can be detected from the finger when all blood is squeezed out and no pulses can be detected. The lower asymptote is at pc(t) = 0 where no deformation of the finger and its artery occurs (although this is a theoretical point of measurement because a minimum contact pressure is needed for proper light coupling). The amplitudes of the v(t)-pulses are derived from the high-pass filtered vPulse(t). The amplitudes of vPulse(t) are fitted using a Gaussian-style envelope curve, as can be seen in Fig.\u00a03b. The peak of this envelope indicates mBP according to the maximum oscillation rule33, a principle which also holds true when using PPG signals34\u201336. After oscillometric envelope determination, the system applies mBP as initial contact pressure pc(t) and stores this value as the starting setpoint P0 and its PPG companion v0. For calibration purposes, sBP and dBP can be determined.Fig. 3Depiction of a typical oscillometric curve including its envelope.a The resulting v(t) (solid blue line) when a pressure ramp pc(t) is applied (ideal pressure ramp shown as the gray line). Averaged signal (dashed-dotted line).

                        "After the closed-loop phase, the mean cuff pressure pC(t) is located on the inflection point of the S-shaped p-v transfer function. As shown in Fig.\u00a04a, the ideal pulsatile vPulse(t) (light blue trace) has maximum amplitude and the integral of vPulse(t) over a full beat is zero. Thus, the main condition of the VCT, which keeps blood volume in the finger artery balanced over a heart cycle, is fulfilled.Fig. 4S-shaped p-v transfer function.a The optimum pulsatile light signal vPulse(t) (light blue trace) at optimal pressure p0 has maximum amplitude with an integral over a full beat of zero. Suboptimal signals at too high (p>) or too low (p<) pressure are either spiky (dark blue trace) or fat (purple trace), respectively. mBP: mean blood pressure. b Vasoconstriction alters the S-shaped p-v transfer function and with it the pulse shapes of the light signals (from the light blue trace to the orange trace)\u2013in particular the contributions of the positive (+) and negative (\u2212) half-waves. c The setpoint p0 and resulting pc(t) are altered after each heartbeat to p1,2,\u2026,n using the volume control technique (VCT). In particular, the pulse shape is restored by VCT after vasoconstriction (see dark blue trace).",
                        "As soon as BP or vasomotor changes occur, the situation becomes different. If pC(t) is lower than mBP (p<), vPulse(t) has a lower amplitude (purple trace) and differs in pulse shape: the pulses are fat. In contrast, if pC(t) is higher than mBP (p>), vPulse(t) has also a lower amplitude, but the pulses are spiky (dark blue trace).",
                        "Figure\u00a04b shows how vasoconstriction influences the p-v transfer function: while the upper asymptote for pC(t) >> sBP remains unchanged, the lower asymptote for pC(t) << dBP shows a higher v(t) because finger blood volume decreases during vasoconstriction. This results in a setpoint lower than the inflection point and a change from v0(t) to a smaller but fat v1(t) with the negative half-wave of the fat pulse being greater than the positive half-wave. On the other hand, vasodilation increases the setpoint over the inflection point, thus producing a spiky signal.",
                        "For both fat and spiky pulses, the integral of the pulsatile volume signal over a beat is no longer equal to zero. The CNAP2GO controller is responsible for restoring this condition of balanced volume control: in particular, the setpoint p0 and resulting pC(t) need to be altered after each heartbeat until balance is achieved (Fig.\u00a04c). A proportional-integral (PI) control approach results in an adaptive formula for setpoint correction as can be seen in the methods section below. The summation of the I (integral) part of the control approach is the memory for the setpoints p1,2,\u2026,n that allows for the reconstruction of long-term BP information (see also the Methods section for details).",
                        "This mechanism not only works for vasomotor changes but also for pure mBP changes. An increase in mBP\u2014which is a shift of the p-v transfer function to the right\u2014tends to move the setpoint towards the lower asymptote of the p-v transfer function. The integral over the beat will be negative resulting in an increase of the setpoint pn. Vasodilation shifts the S-curve in the opposite way and VCT decreases pn."

We chose a printable motor with an outer diameter of 30\u2009mm that can be integrated in the plate of a CNAP2GO finger-ring. This motor can change the volume in the fluid-filled bladder and thus contact pressure of the PPG elements via a gear from the motor. With a transmission ratio of the gear element higher than 20.27, this component has a high enough stall torque so that no energy is consumed as long as mBP is stable. With such a fluid-filled transmission system, the motor should theoretically change contact pressure for 1\u2009mmHg within 10\u2009ms. Assuming additional time due to control loops and further tolerances, we assume that a rate of pressure changes of up to 30\u2009mmHg/s could be achieved with this particular piezo motor.",

Then the VCT criteria are used to derive the resulting new pc(t). In the validation experiments, pc(t) was adjusted using the CNAP pressure system and the finger cuff. In miniaturized CNAP2GO, the fluid-filled actuator will be activated until the new pc(t) is applied to the finger. Then the actuator will stop and keep pc(t) constant, at best, without power until the next heartbeat is detected.",

Using small XYZ-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes, the orientation of human body segments and movements can be reconstructed and thus vertical difference (dv)\u00a0between the heart and the finger\u00a0can be measured41. As the density of blood is known, hydrostatic pressure can be calculated from dv and simply subtracted from pC(t). Although the measurement of dv during motion needs further research and validation, this form of heart level correction is implementable as opposed to analog corrections for time-based wearable approaches, where the influence of posture and arm movement on, e.g., pulse transition is evident but solutions are unclear42.",

Thus for better patient compliance, CNAP2GO will switch between a measurement mode and an interpolation mode. The measurement mode starts with the initial phase followed by the VCT-phase, where hemodynamic values are measured. These values will be\u00a0fed into a mathematical model, which can be sufficiently trained after a short period of measurement (approximately 2\u2009min). Afterward the external pressure can be reduced to a minimum, just high enough to ensure good light coupling. The trained mathematical model can then be used in the interpolation mode to estimate hemodynamic values from v(t) or vPulse(t) during this low pressure and low power consumption mode. The system will restart \u201cmeasurement mode\u201d, either periodically or triggered by physiological changes (e.g., if prominent changes are detected in the morphology of the PPG signal, a restart of the \u201cmeasurement mode\u201d might be required).

This will assure clinical accuracy of BP and CO for the entire measurement.",

                "Challenges of CNAP2GO are addressed in the article and reveal where further development has to be done:Hydrostatic correction between finger and heart level may be achieved by using small XYZ-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes.The lab tests show that CNA2GO is already resistant to motion artifacts. Artifacts may happen, but after stopping the movement, the system finds back to its correct trace. However, the system has not been tested during sport activities and other heavy movements.Miniaturization of the hardware components can be realized using PPG sensors with an LED and a photodiode. The contact pressure of the light elements to the skin is modifiable by a slow and thus low-energy actuator using a fluid-filled bladder, all of which make wearable CNAP2GO sensors feasible.A continuous external pressure has to be applied on the finger during VCT\u00a0measurement. Figure\u00a012 shows a mechanism how the system may reduce the duration of pressure exposure by using an interpolation mode.CNAP2GO can be self-calibrated by an oscillometric measurement at the beginning of the measurement phase. Further validation work with the self-calibrated system needs to be done to prove clinical accuracy.",
                "In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate that the CNAP2GO method enables mBP to be measured with clinically acceptable accuracy and precision, also during hypo- and hypertensive phases, in patients having surgery and subjects performing physiological maneuvers with hemodynamic activation. According to our experiments, this technique seems to be very well suited for wearable sensors integrated in a finger-ring, as shown in Fig.\u00a08. The resulting continuous BP signal allows for the calculations of advanced hemodynamic variables such as CO, systemic peripheral resistance, baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, and many more. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for BP and blood\u00a0flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings."

                        "The differential part of the controller, vdRhythm(f), takes care of pronounced BP changes (e.g., Valsalva maneuver, hyperventilation, blood loss, etc.). In order to follow the overall CNAP2GO principle, where actuator changes shall be slow, pulsatile blood volume is not clamped. Rather, the pulsatile frequencies are cut off, and the differential controller part acts as a second band-pass filter producing nonpulsatile vdRhythm(f).",

                        "The final CNAP2GO contact pressure is:\\(p_{C}(t) = P_{n} - y_{I} - y_{PD}\\) where cP, cD, and cI are constants for the proportional, differential, and integral approach of the continuous control system, respectively, that keeps pc(t) at the inflection point of the S-curve and thus makes it equal to mBP."

                        "The complex control system outlined above follows the inflection point and thus mBP is tracked by pC(t). As a result, the speed of tracking is limited to the cut-off frequency of vRhythm(f) and vdRhythm(f). This produces the control engineering problem that the stability of the system is reduced if the actuator is slow. Slow-reacting pC(t) creates a so-called pole in the z-plane indicating a tendency to oscillate. These oscillations especially occur when the patient calms down, parasympathetic tone increases, and the breathing frequency (about 0.2\u2009Hz to 0.3\u2009Hz) appears in the BP signal. A digital antiresonance system was developed that makes this pole ineffective. The basic considerations of this system were inspired by a method for suppressing mechanical resonance in high track density hard disk drives50.",
                        "From CNAP2GO\u2019s need for antiresonance we see that a benefit of pulsatile VUT control systems is to inhibit this kind of resonance: Even in very fast pressure generators, pressure in the finger cuff will always lag behind true pulsatile BP. However, the resulting pole in a VUT control system is ineffective as long as the system can be faster than the BP signal.",
                        "Our antiresonance system inhibiting the resonances also for nonpulsatile control is thus a leap forward in the development of miniaturized BP measurement devices with acceptable clinical accuracy. It works as follows: The resonance detector indicates frequency and amplitude of a resonance oscillation in pc(t), which typically occurs between 0.1\u2009Hz to 1\u2009Hz. This information tunes a high-sensitive IIR notch filter which eliminates resonance phenomena. Pseudocode of the antiresonance system is shown in Supplementary Method\u00a02."

We plotted mBP measured with the CNAP2GO system against invasively measured mBP values in scatter plots for visual assessment of the distribution and relationship of the BP data.

While it was not expected that the prototype CNAP2GO would result in identical curves as the reference CNAP Monitor HD, the quality of the relationship between cuff pressure and maximum light amplitude was investigated: visual assessment found that the fluid-filled bladder driven by the slow actuator (infusion pump) provided oscillometric envelopes with a quality comparable to those provided by the CNAP Monitor HD (see Figs.\u00a09, 10 and 11)."
