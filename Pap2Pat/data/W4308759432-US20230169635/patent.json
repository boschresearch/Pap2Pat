                                "Example embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to performing transformations of images using machine-learned model(s) and interpretable user-specified parameters that control the transformations. More specifically, the machine-learned model can be used to perform transformation(s) on an image based on different parameter(s) of a user-specified conditioning vector. The user can specify desired values for defined characteristics of a transformation (e.g., area of transformation, degree of transformation, etc.) for one or more transformations of the defined characteristic(s) (e.g., transforming summer to winter, transforming day-time lighting to night-time lighting, transforming location of a light source, etc.). The user-desired values can be parameterized in the user-specified conditioning vector. As an example, a user may wish to transform an image that depicts a summer environment to an image that depicts a winter environment. The user-specified conditioning vector can include parameters that indicate the type(s) of transformation(s) the user desires (e.g., summer to winter, etc.) and/or the degree of transformation desired (e.g., a full winter transformation, a partial winter transformation, etc.).",
                                "The machine learned model(s) can receive the input image and the user-specified conditioning vector and transform the input image based on the user's desired values for the defined characteristics of an output image. Specifically, the output image can correspond to the input image transformed to have the desired values for the defined characteristic(s). Thus, in the example given above, if the user-specified conditioning vector indicates a 60% transformation of the input image that depicts the summer environment, the output image can depict the same scene but transformed 60% into a winter environment. In such fashion, the machine-learned model can perform one or more transformations on an input image based on user-desired values for the defined characteristics of the transformation(s). Stated differently, a user can be provided with continuous fine-grained control of specific, interpretable characteristics of an image that is transformed.",
                                "More particularly, existing image transformation models generally fail to offer users control over desired values for characteristics of an image transformation. As an example, methods such as Pix2Pix offer binary image transformation (e.g., a full transformation or no transformation), but fail to provide more fine-grained control over characteristics of the transformation (e.g., degree of transformation, etc.) (See Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Alexei A. Efros, Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks, Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1125-1134 (2017)). Further, methods such as Pix2Pix necessitate the use of paired training data (e.g., paired training data with a known ground truth correspondence) (See Isola et al. above).",
                                "In response to these problems, the present disclosure proposes a machine-learned adversarial training approach in conjunction with the use of user-specified conditioning vectors to provide parameterized image transformations without the need for paired training data. More specifically, in one example, the disclosure proposes an adversarial network (e.g., a generative adversarial network, etc.) utilizing one or more machine-learned generator models and one or more machine-learned discriminator models. The one or more machine-learned generator models can be configured to receive an input image and a user specified conditioning vector. The user specified conditioning vector can parameterize one or more desired values for one or more defined characteristics of an output image. The machine-learned generator model can be configured to perform, based at least in part on the user-specified conditioning vector, one or more transformations on the input image to generate the output image with the desired values for the defined characteristics.",
                                "The one or more machine-learned discriminator models can be configured to receive the output image, a target image, and the user specified conditioning vector. The discriminator model(s) can be further configured to generate a discriminator output that selects one of the output image and the target image as having the one or more desired values for the one or more defined characteristics. At least one of the machine-learned generator model(s) can be trained based at least in part on the discriminator output. Thus, in such fashion, the machine-learned generator model(s) can be trained to apply one or more transformations to the input image according to the desired values for the defined characteristics(s) of the output image.",
                                "More particularly, one or more machine-learned generator models can be configured to receive an input image and a user-specified conditioning vector. The user-specified conditioning vector can parameterize one or more desired values for one or more defined characteristics of an output image. In some implementations, the user-specified conditioning vector can be a real and continuously valued vector. As an example, the vector can include values (e.g., parameterized user-desired values) that are both real and continuous (e.g., 0.5, 1, 0.2235, \u22125, etc.), the values corresponding to one or more desired characteristics of the output image.",
                                "In some implementations, the user-specified conditioning vector can describe a degree to which the one or more transformations are applied to the input image. As an example, the user-specified conditioning vector can include parameterized user-desired values (e.g., 1, 0, 0.5, etc.) that describe one or more transformations to perform and the desired degree to which the transformation(s) (e.g., transforming day-time lighting characteristics to night-time lighting characteristics, etc.) should be performed. For example, the conditioning vector can describe a nighttime to daytime transformation that is to be applied at a value of 0.5, resulting in a partially transformed output image. As another example, the conditioning vector can describe a summer to winter transformation to be applied at a value of 1.0, resulting in a fully transformed output image.",
                                "The one or more machine-learned generator models can be configured to perform, based at least in part on the user-specified conditioning vector, one or more transformations on the input image to generate the output image with the one or more desired values for the one or more defined characteristics. The user-specified conditioning vector can specify the transformation(s) to be performed on the input image. As an example, the user-specified conditioning vector can specify a summer-to-winter transformation (e.g., transforming the environment depicted in the input image from a summer environment to a winter environment) to perform to the input image. As another example, the user-specified conditioning vector can specify a summer-to-winter transformation and a day-to-night transformation (e.g., transforming the time of day depicted in the input image from daytime lighting characteristics to nighttime lighting characteristics). The user-specified conditioning vector can describe a plurality of transformations and a plurality of defined characteristics associated with each respective transformation.",
                                "In some implementations, the user-specified conditioning vector can specify one or more areas of the input image to which the one or more transformations are applied. As an example, the user-specified conditioning vector can include value(s) that specify that the transformation(s) should be applied to a top half of the input image. As another example, the user-specified conditioning vector can include value(s) that specify that the transformation should be applied to a bottom left portion of the input image. It should be noted that the user-specified conditioning vector can be multi-dimensional and can therefore specify one or more areas of the input image in one or more dimensions. As an example, the user-specified conditioning vector can, in some implementations, describe a transformation that applies a light source to an image. The user-specified conditioning vector can further specify the location of the light source in three dimensions (e.g., an x coordinate, a y coordinate, a z coordinate, etc.).",
                                "The defined characteristics of the output image can describe one or more feature(s), style(s), content(s), or any other aspect(s) of the output image. In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include a style characteristic that describes one or more stylistic transformation(s) to perform on the input image. As an example, a digital image generated by a digital camera can be transformed to a painting (e.g., an image to painting transformation). The machine-learned generator model can be trained so that the style transformation can replicate various styles of known artists (e.g., Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, etc.). For example, a digital input image generated by a digital camera can be transformed to an output image that replicates the style of Picasso. It should be noted that the aforementioned style transformation can also be performed by the machine-learned generator model in reverse (e.g., transforming a Picasso painting to a \u201cdigital image\u201d style). Both of the aforementioned style transformations can be applied to the input image to a certain degree. For example, an image to painting transformation can be applied to an input image with a desired value of 0.5, which can produce an output image that is partially transformed to a painting style. The style characteristic can describe any sort of subjective and/or objective transformation to apply to the image (e.g., painting style, drawing style, animation style, camera focal length/focal point, etc.).",
                                "In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include light characteristics and/or light source location characteristics. As an example, a digital image depicting a human face can be transformed so that a light source is present in the image projecting light at a certain intensity. As mentioned previously, the light source can be placed three-dimensionally during the transformation. For example, the desired values for the light source may place the light source behind the human face at an intensity of 0.2. For another example, the desired values for the light source may place the light source in front and to the right of the human face at an intensity of 0.8. In such fashion, the light source transformation can illuminate and/or darken various aspects of an input image in a three-dimensional manner. It should be noted that a plurality of light sources can be included in the light source transformation based on the desired values for the defined light source transformation characteristics.",
                                "In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include color characteristics. As an example, an input image lacking color (e.g., black and white, grayscale, etc.) can be transformed to an output image containing color (e.g., RGB image, CMYK image, etc.). In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include environmental characteristics. Environmental characteristics can include any sort of weather effect (e.g., rain, snow, hail, etc.), seasonal effect (summer, autumn, winter, spring, etc.), or any other sort of environmentally-related transformation (e.g., transforming a body of water to ice during the winter, etc.). As an example, an environmental transformation can add rain, snow, or other weather effects to an image. As another example, an environmental transformation can change the seasonal environment of an image from summer to winter (e.g., adding snowfall, changing the color of foliage and/or vegetation, freezing bodies of water, changing the angle and intensity of sunlight and/or shadows, etc.).",
                                "In some implementations, the environmental characteristic(s) of the output image can include a time of day. More particularly, the environmental characteristic(s) can determine the lighting of the environment depicted in an output image. As an example, an input image taken in an outdoor environment at 2:00 pm (e.g., with day-time lighting conditions) can be transformed to an output image of the same outdoor environment taken at 10:00 pm (e.g., with night-time lighting conditions). In such fashion, the environmental characteristics can transform a \u201cdaytime\u201d image to a \u201cnighttime\u201d image and vice-versa. It should be noted that the time of day can be transformed in conjunction with other environmental characteristics of the output image. As an example, a summer daytime image can be transformed to a winter nighttime image. As another example, a winter image without rain can be transformed to a summer image that depicts rainfall.",
                                "In some implementations, the defined characteristics of the output image can include feature characteristics. Feature characteristics can include features (e.g., objects, people, environments, organisms, text, etc.) depicted in the input and/or output image. As an example, an input image may depict a horse in a rural environment. The feature characteristics of the output image may include the coloring of the horse. In such fashion, the coloring of the horse can be changed, for example, to the coloring of a zebra, or any other sort of coloring pattern. As another example, an input image may depict a vehicle (e.g., an automobile, helicopter, etc.) in the background. The feature characteristics of the output image can include changing the color of the vehicle (e.g., red to blue), the type of vehicle (e.g., changing the vehicle from a first type of automobile to a second type of automobile), or removing the vehicle. The feature characteristics of the output image can include any aspect of any feature of the output image.",
                                "In some implementations, the one or more machine-learned generator models can include an encoder portion and a decoder portion. The user-specified conditioning vector can be provided to the decoder portion of the one or more machine-learned generator models. More particularly, a series of layers in the encoder portion (e.g., convolutional layers in a convolutional neural network) can encode the input image into a compressed representation that can be used as inputs to a series of residual blocks (e.g., residual blocks of a residual neural network(s)). A stack of connected layers can learn to transform the raw values of the user-specified conditioning vector to an alternative representation. At the lowest layer of the machine-learned generator model(s) (e.g., the bottleneck layer), the image representation and the alternative representation of the user-specified conditioning vector can be mixed by concatenation to one or more areas along the feature dimension of the image. A series of convolutional layers can decode the combined (e.g., concatenated) data into an output image.",
                                "The one or more machine-learned generator models can be or otherwise include one or more neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) or the like. Neural networks (e.g., deep neural networks) can be feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and/or various other types of neural networks. In some implementations, the one or more machine-learned generator models can be residual neural networks including connections (e.g., skip connections) between individual layers of the residual neural networks. The connections between layers can be utilized to send the user-specified conditioning vector to a matching layer (e.g., a mirrored layer) of the network before the user-specified conditioning vector is reduced to a lowest alternative representation. In such fashion, a training signal (e.g., an optimization function) can be more effectively backpropagated through the machine-learned generator models.",
                                "The machine-learned discriminator model can be configured to receive the output image, a target image, and the user-specified conditioning vector. A target image can be an image from a set of target images representative of the desired output image. As an example, if an output image has been transformed to include defined style characteristics of a Picasso painting, the target image can be an image from a set of Picasso paintings. As another example, if an output image has been transformed to include defined environmental characteristic of a winter environment, the target image may be an image from a set of images depicting a winter environment.",

The machine-learned discriminator model(s) can account for the inclusion of the user-specified conditioning vector in the transformation. More particularly, the machine-learned discriminator model(s) can, based at least in part on the user-specified conditioning vector, select one of the output image and the target image based on the defined characteristics of the output image.",
                                "In some implementations, the one or more machine-learned discriminator models can contain a plurality of layers configured to evaluate different aspects of the discriminator output. As an example, an initial layer (e.g., a convolutional layer of a convolutional neural network) of the discriminator model(s) can operate solely on the output image to extract a suitable deep representation (e.g., a latent space representation of the output image). The machine-learned discriminator model(s) can transform the user-specified conditioning vector through a series of fully connected layers (e.g., convolutional layers of a convolutional neural network) in a similar fashion to the machine-learned generator model(s). The learned representations of the input image and of the user-specified conditioning vector can be mixed by concatenation to spatial location(s) along the feature dimension in a manner similar to the machine-learned generator model(s). A series of layers (e.g., convolutional layers of a convolutional neural network) can operate on the concatenated representation to produce a classification score for the patch(s) of the output image. The selection output can be obtained by analyzing the patch(s) of the output image (e.g., performing a mean average pooling operation(s), etc.).",

In some implementations, the machine-learned discriminator model(s) and machine-learned generator model(s) can be trained in an adversarial fashion (e.g., a generative adversarial network). The specific training signal(s) used to train or retrain the machine-learned models and the methods utilized to do so will be discussed in-depth in the following figures.",

Alternatively, or additionally, in some embodiments, the user-specified conditioning vector can be input at other points of the network architecture. As an example, the user-specified conditioning vector can be input to the same layer as the input image. As another example, the user-specified conditioning vector can be concatenated to the output of some other layer(s) (e.g., after the transformation(s) have been applied to the image, etc.). In such fashion, a training signal (e.g., an optimization function) can be more effectively backpropagated through the machine-learned discriminator model(s).",

As one example technical effect and benefit, the systems and methods of the present disclosure enable a significant advancement in image transformation techniques compared to other approaches. While other methods known in the art are generally limited to binary image transformations (e.g., full day-time lighting, full night-time lighting, etc.), the present disclosure allows transformations to be applied to an input image to a certain degree that is specified by a user. This functionality provides users significant control over the application of transformations. As an example, a user can apply a day-to-night transformation to a lesser degree to reproduce the lighting characteristics of a sunset. As another example, a user can apply a summer-to-winter transformation to a lesser degree to reproduce the environmental characteristics of an early winter.",
                                "As another technical effect and benefit, the generalized machine-learned generator model(s) of the present disclosure allow for training without specifically paired training data. More particularly, the model(s) of the present disclosure can be trained using training images with labels that only determine a set identity (e.g., a set of images depicting various winter environments). Other models known in the art necessitate the use of paired training data (e.g., an image of an environment taken in the summer and a paired image of the same environment taken in the winter). Paired training data for the transformations performed by the model(s) of this disclosure can prove almost impossible to gather (e.g., a winter to summer transformation would necessitate waiting for seasonal changes to gather paired training data, etc.). Thus, the proposed model(s) can eliminate the requirement to spend significant time and resources gathering paired training data to train generator model(s).",
                                "As another example technical effect and benefit, the systems and methods of the present disclosure allow for generalized machine-learned generator model(s), which in turn allow for the application of multiple transformations to an input image. Other approaches known in the art can generally only be trained to apply one transformation to an input image, or can only be performed in an unintuitive fashion. However, the present disclosure enables machine-learned generator model(s) to be trained to apply a plurality of transformations to an input image. As an example, a model can be trained to transform an input image from day-time lighting characteristics and summer environmental characteristics to night-time lighting characteristics and winter environmental characteristics. In such fashion, the model can be trained to provide more realistic and complete image transformations compared to other methods known in the art. Further, the capability to perform multiple transformations with one model reduces the number of machine-learned models required, therefore reducing computing resource usage (e.g., processor usage, memory usage, etc.) associated with training multiple models.",

For example, the conditioning vector 404 can describe a nighttime to daytime transformation that is to be applied at a value of 0.5, resulting in a partially transformed output image. As another example, the conditioning vector 404 can describe a summer to winter transformation to be applied at a value of 1.0, resulting in a fully transformed output image.",

In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include a style characteristic that describes one or more stylistic transformation(s) to perform on the input image 406. As an example, an input image 406 (e.g., a digital image generated by a digital camera) can be transformed to a painting (e.g., an image to painting transformation). The machine-learned generator model(s) 408 can be trained so that the style transformation can replicate various styles of known artists (e.g., Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, etc.). For example, a digital input image 406 generated by a digital camera can be transformed to an output image 412 that replicates the style of Picasso. It should be noted that the aforementioned style transformation can also be performed by the machine-learned generator model(s) 408 in reverse (e.g., transforming a Picasso painting to a \u201cdigital image\u201d style), as will be discussed in greater detail with reference to FIG. 5. Both of the aforementioned style transformations can be applied to the input image 406 to a certain degree. For example, an image to painting transformation can be applied to an input image 406 with a desired value of 0.5, which can produce an output image 412 that is partially transformed to a painting style. The style characteristic can describe any sort of subjective and/or objective transformation to apply to the image (e.g., painting style, drawing style, animation style, camera focal length/focal point, etc.).",

As an example, a digital input image 406 depicting a human face can be transformed so that a light source is present in the image projecting light at a certain intensity. As will be discussed in greater detail with reference to FIG. 6B, the light source can be placed three-dimensionally during the transformation. For example, the desired values for the light source may place the light source behind the human face at an intensity of 0.2. For another example, the desired values for the light source may place the light source in front and to the right of the human face at an intensity of 0.8. In such fashion, the light source transformation can illuminate and/or darken various aspects of the input image 406 in a three-dimensional manner.

As an example, an input image 406 lacking color (e.g., black and white, grayscale, etc.) can be transformed to an output image 412 containing color (e.g., RGB image, CMYK image, etc.). In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include environmental characteristics. Environmental characteristics can include any sort of weather effect (e.g., rain, snow, hail, etc.), seasonal effect (summer, autumn, winter, spring, etc.), or any other sort of environmentally-related transformation (e.g., transforming a body of water to ice during the winter, etc.). As an example, an environmental transformation can add rain, snow, or other weather effects to an output image 412. As another example, an environmental transformation can change the seasonal environment of an input image 406 from summer to winter (e.g., adding snowfall, changing the color of foliage and/or vegetation, freezing bodies of water, changing the angle and intensity of sunlight and/or shadows, etc.).",

More particularly, the environmental characteristic(s) can determine the lighting of the environment depicted in the output image 412. As an example, an input image 406 taken in an outdoor environment at 2:00 pm (e.g., with day-time lighting conditions) can be transformed to an output image 412 of the same outdoor environment taken at 10:00 pm (e.g., with night-time lighting conditions). In such fashion, the environmental characteristics can transform a \u201cdaytime\u201d image to a \u201cnighttime\u201d image and vice-versa. It should be noted that the time of day can be transformed in conjunction with other environmental characteristics of the output image. As an example, a summer daytime image can be transformed to a winter nighttime image. As another example, a winter image without rain can be transformed to a summer image that depicts rainfall.",

As an example, an input image 406 may depict a horse in a rural environment. The feature characteristics of the output image 412 may include the coloring of the horse. In such fashion, the coloring of the horse can be changed, for example, to the coloring of a zebra, or any other sort of coloring pattern. As another example, an input image 406 may depict a vehicle (e.g., an automobile, helicopter, etc.) in the background. The feature characteristics of the output image 412 can include changing the color of the vehicle (e.g., red to blue), the type of vehicle (e.g., changing the vehicle from a first type of automobile to a second type of automobile), or removing the vehicle. The feature characteristics of the output image 412 can include any aspect of any feature of the output image 412.",

The input image can be a digital image (e.g., a digital image captured by a digital image capture device, etc.). The user-specified conditioning vector can parameterize one or more desired values for one or more defined characteristics of an output image. In some implementations, the user-specified conditioning vector can be a real and continuously valued vector. As an example, the vector can include values (e.g., parameterized user-desired values) that are both real and continuous (e.g., 0.5, 1, 0.2235, \u22125, etc.), the values corresponding to one or more desired characteristics of the output image. At 706, the method 700 can include generating, using the one or more machine-learned generator models, an output image having the one or more desired values for the one or more characteristics. The defined characteristics of the output image can describe one or more feature(s), style(s), content(s), or any other aspect(s) of the output image. In some implementations, the defined characteristics can include a style characteristic that describes one or more stylistic transformation(s) to perform on the input image. As an example, a digital image generated by a digital camera can be transformed to a painting (e.g., an image to painting transformation). The machine-learned generator model can be trained so that the style transformation can replicate various styles of known artists (e.g., Monet, Van Gogh, Picasso, etc.). For example, a digital input image generated by a digital camera can be transformed to an output image that replicates the style of Picasso. It should be noted that the aforementioned style transformation can also be performed by the machine-learned generator model in reverse (e.g., transforming a Picasso painting to a \u201cdigital image\u201d style). Both of the aforementioned style transformations can be applied to the input image to a certain degree. For example, an image to painting transformation can be applied to an input image with a desired value of 0.5, which can produce an output image that is partially transformed to a painting style. The style characteristic can describe any sort of subjective and/or objective transformation to apply to the image (e.g., painting style, drawing style, animation style, camera focal length/focal point, etc.)."
