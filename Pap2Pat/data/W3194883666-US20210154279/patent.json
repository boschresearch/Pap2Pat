                        "The mammalian immune system has evolved a variety of mechanisms to protect the host from cancerous cells. An important component of this response is mediated by cells referred to as T cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are specialized T cells that primarily function by recognizing and killing cancerous cells or infected cells, but they can also function by secreting soluble molecules referred to as cytokines that can mediate a variety of effects on the immune system. T helper cells primarily function by recognizing antigen on specialized antigen presenting cells, and in turn secreting cytokines that activate B cells, T cells, and macrophages. A variety of evidence suggests that immunotherapy designed to stimulate a tumor-specific CTL response would be effective in controlling cancer. For example, it has been shown that human CTL recognize sarcomas (Slovin et al., 1986), renal cell carcinomas (Schendel et al., 1993), colorectal carcinomas (Jacob et al., 1997), ovarian carcinomas (Peoples et al., 1993), pancreatic carcinomas (Peiper et al., 1997), squamous tumors of the head and neck (Yasumura et al., 1993), and squamous carcinomas of the lung (Slingluff et al., 1994; Yoshino et al., 1994). The largest number of reports of human tumor-reactive CTLs, however, has concerned melanomas (Boon et al., 1994).",
                        "The ability of tumor-specific CTL to mediate tumor regression, in both human (Parmiani et al., 2002; Weber, 2002) and animal models, suggests that methods directed at increasing CTL activity would likely have a beneficial effect with respect to tumor treatment.",
                        "Colorectal cancer (CRC), commonly also known as colon cancer or bowel cancer, is a cancer from uncontrolled cell growth in the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine), or in the appendix. Symptoms typically include rectal bleeding and anemia which are sometimes associated with weight loss and changes in bowel habits. Most colorectal cancer occurs due to lifestyle and increasing age with only a minority of cases associated with underlying genetic disorders. It typically starts in the lining of the bowel and if left untreated, can grow into the muscle layers underneath, and then through the bowel wall. Screening is effective at decreasing the chance of dying from colorectal cancer and is recommended starting at the age of 50 and continuing until a person is 75 years old. Localized bowel cancer is usually diagnosed through sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon are often curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely around the body is usually not curable and management then focuses on extending the person's life via chemotherapy and improving quality of life. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, but it is more common in developed countries. Around 60% of cases were diagnosed in the developed world. It is estimated that worldwide in 2008, 1.23 million new cases of colorectal cancer were clinically diagnosed, and that it killed 608,000 people.",
                        "In Europe, the five year survival for colorectal cancer is less than 60%. In the developed world, about a third of people who get the disease die from it. Survival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers. For example, patients with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have an average 5-year survival of 100%, while those with an invasive cancer, i.e. T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) cancer have an average 5-year survival of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor, yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average 5-year survival of approximately 70%. Patients with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average 5-year survival of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have an average 5-year survival of approximately 5%.",
                        "According to the American Cancer Society statistics in 2006, over 20% of patients present with metastatic (Stage IV) colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and up to 25% of this group will have isolated liver metastasis that is potentially resectable. Lesions which undergo curative resection have demonstrated 5-year survival outcomes now exceeding 50%. Nevertheless, additional therapeutics that are safer and more effective than current therapies are in high demand.",
                        "In order for CTL to kill or secrete cytokines in response to a cancer cell, the CTL must first recognize the cancer cell (Townsend & Bodmer, 1989). This process involves the interaction of the T cell receptor, located on the surface of the CTL, with what is generically referred to as an MHC-peptide complex which is located on the surface of the cancerous cell. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded molecules have been subdivided into two types, and are referred to as class I and class II MHC-encoded molecules. In the human immune system, MHC molecules are referred to as human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Within the MHC complex, located on chromosome six, are three different loci that encode for class I MHC molecules. MHC molecules encoded at these loci are referred to as HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. The genes that can be encoded at each of these loci are extremely polymorphic, and thus, different individuals within the population express different class I MHC molecules on the surface of their cells. HLA-A1, HLA-A2, HLA-A3, HLA-B7, HLA-B14, HLA-B27, and HLA-B44 are examples of different class I MHC molecules that can be expressed from these loci.",
                        "The peptides which associate with the MHC molecules can either be derived from proteins made within the cell, in which case they typically associate with class I MHC molecules (Rock & Goldberg, 1999); or they can be derived from proteins which are acquired from outside of the cell, in which case they typically associate with class II MHC molecules (Watts, 1997). The peptides that evoke a cancer-specific CTL response most typically associate with class I MHC molecules. The peptides themselves are typically nine amino acids in length, but can vary from a minimum length of eight amino acids to a maximum of fourteen amino acids in length. Tumor antigens may also bind to class II MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells and provoke a T helper cell response. The peptides that bind to class II MHC molecules are generally twelve to nineteen amino acids in length, but can be as short as ten amino acids and as long as thirty amino acids.",
                        "The process by which intact proteins are degraded into peptides is referred to as antigen processing. Two major pathways of antigen processing occur within cells (Rock & Goldberg, 1999). One pathway, which is largely restricted to professional antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, degrades proteins that are typically phagocytosed or endocytosed into the cell. Peptides derived from this pathway can be presented on either class I or to class II MHC molecules. A second pathway of antigen processing is present in essentially all cells of the body. This second pathway primarily degrades proteins that are made within the cells, and the peptides derived from this pathway primarily bind to class I MHC molecules. Antigen processing by this latter pathway involves polypeptide synthesis and proteolysis in the cytoplasm, followed by transport of peptides to the plasma membrane for presentation. These peptides, initially being transported into the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell, become associated with newly synthesized class I MHC molecules and the resulting complexes are then transported to the cell surface. Peptides derived from membrane and secreted proteins have also been identified. In some cases these peptides correspond to the signal sequence of the proteins which is cleaved from the protein by the signal peptidase. In other cases, it is thought that some fraction of the membrane and secreted proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm where processing subsequently occurs. Once bound to the class I MHC molecule, the peptides are recognized by antigen-specific receptors on CTL. Several methods have been developed to identify the peptides recognized by CTL, each method of which relies on the ability of a CTL to recognize and kill only those cells expressing the appropriate class I MHC molecule with the peptide bound to it. Mere expression of the class I MHC molecule is insufficient to trigger the CTL to kill the target cell if the antigenic peptide is not bound to the class I MHC molecule. Such peptides can be derived from a non-self source, such as a pathogen (for example, following the infection of a cell by a bacterium or a virus) or from a self-derived protein within a cell, such as a cancerous cell. The tumor antigens from which the peptides are derived can broadly be categorized as differentiation antigens, cancer/testis antigens, mutated gene products, widely expressed proteins, viral antigens and most recently, phosphopeptides derived from dysregulated signal transduction pathways. (Zarling el al., 2006).",
                        "Immunization with cancer-derived, class I or class II MHC-encoded molecule associated peptides, or with a precursor polypeptide or protein that contains the peptide, or with a gene that encodes a polypeptide or protein containing the peptide, are forms of immunotherapy that can be employed in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Identification of the immunogens is a necessary first step in the formulation of the appropriate immunotherapeutic agent or agents. Although a large number of tumor-associated peptide antigens recognized by tumor reactive CTL have been identified, there are few examples of antigens that are derived from proteins that are selectively expressed on a broad array of tumors, as well as associated with cellular proliferation and/or transformation.",
                        "Attractive candidates for this type of antigen are peptides derived from proteins that are differentially phosphorylated on serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and/or tyrosine (Tyr; Zarling et al., 2000). Due to the increased and dysregulated phosphorylation of cellular proteins in transformed cells as compared to normal cells, tumors are likely to present a unique subset of phosphorylated peptides on the cell surface that are available for recognition by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). Presently, there is no way to predict which protein phosphorylation sites in a cell will be unique to tumors, survive the antigen processing pathway, and be presented to the immune system in the context of 8-14 residue phosphopeptides bound to class I MHC molecules.",
                        "Thirty-six phosphopeptides were disclosed as presented in association with HLA-A*0201 on cancer cells (see Table 1 of Zarling et al., 2006). Parent proteins for four of these peptides (\u03b2-catenin, insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), tensin-3, and Jun-C/D) are associated with cytoplasmic signaling pathways and cellular transformation.",
                        "Until the present disclosure, no studies have examined MHC class-I-bound phosphopeptide displayed on primary human tumor samples and, there is only limited evidence of a human immune response against class-I-restricted phosphopeptides."

                                "The presently disclosed subject matter relates in some embodiments to post-translationally modified immunogenic therapeutic target peptides, e.g., phosphopeptides and optionally phosphopeptides comprising modified amino acids including, but not limited to phosphohomoserine, for use in immunotherapy and diagnostic methods of using the target peptides, as well as methods of selecting the same to make compositions for immunotherapy, e.g., in vaccines and/or in compositions useful in adaptive cell transfer.",
                                "In some embodiments, the target peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter are post-translationally modified by being provided with a phosphate group, (i.e., \u201cphosphopeptides\u201d including, but not limited to peptides comprising phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, and derivatives thereof including but not limited to phosphohomoserine).",
                                "The target peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter are in some embodiments not the entire proteins from which they are derived (i.e., are fragments and/or subsequences of larger polypeptides). They are in some embodiments from 8 to 50 contiguous amino acid residues of the native human protein. In some embodiments, they can contain exactly, about, or at least 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 amino acids. The peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter can in some embodiments also have a length that falls in the ranges of 8-10, 9-12, 10-13, 11-14, 12-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, and 45-50 amino acids. In some embodiments, exactly, about, or at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or more of the amino acid residues within a recited sequence of a target peptide is phosphorylated and/or contains a modified phosphoamino acid including, but not limited to phosphohomoserine.",
                                "Target peptides can be modified and analogs (using for example, \u03b2-amino acids, L-amino acids, N-methylated amino acids, amidated amino acids, non-natural amino acids, retro inverse peptides, peptoids, PNA, halogenated amino acids) can be synthesized that retain their ability to stimulate a particular immune response but which also gain one or more beneficial features, such as those described herein below. Thus, a particular target peptide can, for example, have use for treating and vaccinating against multiple cancer types.",
                                "Substitutions can be made in the target peptides at residues known to interact with the MHC molecule. Such substitutions can have the effect of increasing the binding affinity of the target peptides for the MHC molecule and can also increase the half-life of the target peptide-MHC complex, the consequence of which is that the substituted target peptide is a more potent stimulator of an immune response than is the original target peptide.",
                                "Additionally, in some embodiments the substitutions have no effect on the immunogenicity of the target peptide per se, but rather prolong its biological half-life and/or prevent it from undergoing spontaneous alterations which might otherwise negatively impact on the immunogenicity of the peptide.",
                                "The target peptides disclosed herein can have differing levels of immunogenicity, MHC binding, and ability to elicit CTL responses against cells displaying a native target peptide (e.g., on the surface of a tumor cell).",
                                "A phosphopeptide as disclosed herein is in some embodiments modified such that its immunogenicity and/or its binding is enhanced. In some embodiments, the modified target peptide binds to an MHC class I molecule about or at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100, 110, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 375, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000% or more tightly than its native counterpart.",
                                "However, given the exquisite sensitivity of the T cell receptor, it cannot be foreseen whether such enhanced binding and/or immunogenicity will render a modified target peptide still capable of inducing an activated CTL that will cross react with the native target peptide being displayed on the surface of a tumor. Indeed, it is disclosed herein that the binding affinity of a target peptide does not predict its functional ability to elicit a T cell response.",
                                "Target peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter can in some embodiments be mixed together to form a cocktail. The target peptides can be in an admixture, or they can be linked together in a concatamer and/or in other arrangement as a single molecule. Linkers between individual target peptides can be used; these can, for example, be formed in some embodiments by any 10 to 20 amino acid residues. The linkers can be random sequences, or they can be optimized for degradation by dendritic cells.",
                                "In certain specified positions, a native amino acid residue in a native human protein can be altered to enhance its binding to an MHC class I molecule. These occur in \u201canchor\u201d positions of the target peptides, often in positions 1, 2, 3, 9, or 10. Valine, alanine, lysine, leucine tyrosine, arginine, phenylalanine, proline, glutamic acid, 5 threonine, serine, aspartic acid, tryptophan, and methionine can also be used as improved anchoring residues. Anchor residues for different HLA molecules are listed below in Table 1.",
                                "In some embodiments, the immunogenicity of a target peptide is measured using transgenic mice expressing human MHC class I genes. For example, \u201cADD Tg mice\u201d express an interspecies hybrid class I MHC gene, AAD, which contains the \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-2 domains of the human HLA-A2.1 gene and the \u03b1-3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse H-2Dd gene, under the transcriptional control of the human HLA-A2.1 promoter. Immunodetection of the HLA-A2.1 recombinant transgene established that expression was at equivalent levels to endogenous mouse class I molecules. The mouse \u03b1-3 domain expression enhances the immune response in this system. Compared to unmodified HLA-A2.1, the chimeric HLA-A2.1/H2-Dd MHC Class I molecule mediates efficient positive selection of mouse T cells to provide a more complete T cell repertoire capable of recognizing peptides presented by HLA-A2.1 Class I molecules.",
                                "The peptide epitopes presented and recognized by mouse T cells in the context of the HLA-A2.1/H2-Dd class I molecule are the same as those presented in HLA-A2.1+ humans. This transgenic strain enables the modeling of human T cell immune responses to HLA-A2 presented antigens, and identification of those antigens. This transgenic strain is a preclinical model for design and testing of vaccines for infectious diseases or cancer therapy involving optimal stimulation of CD8+ cytolytic T cells.",
                                "In some embodiments, the immunogenicity of a modified phosphopeptide is determined by the degree of Interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) production of T cells from ADD Tg mice immunized with the target peptide, e.g., by immunization with target peptide pulsed bone marrow derived dendritic cells.",
                                "In some embodiments, the modified target peptides are about or at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100, 110, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 350, 375, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 5000% or more immunogenic, e.g., in terms of numbers of IFN\u03b3- and/or TNF-\u03b1-positive (i.e., \u201cactivated\u201d) T cells relative to numbers elicited by native target peptides in ADD Tg mice immunized with phosphopeptide-pulsed bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). In some embodiments, the target peptides are modified target peptides. In some embodiments, the modified target peptides are able to elicit CD8+ T cells that are cross-reactive with the modified and the native target peptide in general and when such modified and native target peptides are complexed with MHC class I molecules in particular. In some embodiments, the CD8 T cells that are cross-reactive with the modified and the native target peptides are able to reduce tumor size by about or at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% in a NOD/SCID/IL-2R\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 knock out mouse relative to IL-2 treatment without such cross-reactive CD8+ T cells.",
                                "The phrase \u201ccapable of inducing a target peptide-specific memory T cell response in a patient\u201d as used herein relates to eliciting a response from memory T cells (also referred to as \u201cantigen-experienced T cell\u201d), which are a subset of infection- and cancer-fighting T cells that have previously encountered and responded to their cognate antigen. Such T cells can recognize foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses, as well as cancer cells. Memory T cells have become \u201cexperienced\u201d by having encountered antigen during a prior infection, having encountered cancer, or via previous vaccination. At a second encounter with the cognate antigen (e.g., by way of an initial inoculation with a target peptide of the presently disclosed subject matter), memory T cells can reproduce to mount a faster and stronger immune response than the first time the immune system responded to the invader (e.g., through the body's own consciously unperceived recognition of a target peptide being associated with diseased tissue). This behavior can be assayed in T lymphocyte proliferation assays, which can reveal exposure to specific antigens.",
                                "Memory T cells comprise two subtypes: central memory T cells (TCM cells) and effector memory T cells (TEM cells). Memory cells can be either CD4+ or CD8+. Memory T cells typically express the cell surface protein CD45RO. Central memory (TCM) cells generally express L-selectin and CCR7, and they secrete IL-2 but not IFN\u03b3 or IL-4. Effector memory (TEM) cells, however, generally do not express L-selectin or CCR7 but produce effector cytokines like IFN\u03b3 and IL-4.",
                                "A memory T cell response generally results in the proliferation of memory T cells and/or the upregulation or increased secretion of factors such as CD45RO, L-selectin, CCR7, IL-2, IFN\u03b3, CD45RA, CD27, and/or IL-4. In some embodiments, the target peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter are capable of inducing a TCM cell response associated with L-selectin, CCR7, IL-2 but not IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 expression and/or secretion. See e.g., Hamann et al., 1997. In some embodiments, a TCM cell response is associated with an at least or an about 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98\u00b0, 99%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, 1000%, 1500%, 2000% or more increase in T cell CD45RO/RA, L-selectin, CCR7, or IL-2 expression and/secretion.",

As such, the target peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter can in some embodiments be referred to as \u201cneo-antigens.\u201d Although target peptides might be considered \u201cself\u201d for being derived from self-tissue, they generally are only found on the surface of cells with a dysregulated metabolism (e.g., aberrant phosphorylation), and they are likely never presented to immature T cells in the thymus. As such, these \u201cself\u201d antigens act are neo-antigens because they are nevertheless capable of eliciting an immune response.",

Moreover, in some embodiments about or at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more of the serine, homoserine, threonine, or tyrosine residues within the recited sequence is phosphorylated. The phosphorylation can be with a natural phosphorylation (\u2014CH2\u2014O\u2014PO3H) or with an enzyme non-degradable, modified phosphorylation, such as but not limited to \u2014CH2\u2014CF2\u2014PO3H or \u2014CH2\u2014CH2\u2014PO3H.

                                "The chemical structure of a phosphopeptide mimetic appropriate for use in the presently disclosed subject matter can in some embodiments closely approximate the natural phosphorylated residue which is mimicked, and also be chemically stable (e.g., resistant to dephosphorylation by phosphatase enzymes). This can be achieved with a synthetic molecule in which the phosphorous atom is linked to the amino acid residue, not through oxygen, but through carbon. In some embodiments, a CF2 group links the amino acid to the phosphorous atom. Mimetics of several amino acids which are phosphorylated in nature can be generated by this approach. Mimetics of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine can be generated by placing a CF2 linkage from the appropriate carbon to the phosphate moiety. The mimetic molecule L-2-amino-4 (diethylphosphono)-4, 4-difluorobutanoic acid (F2Pab) can substitute for phosphoserine (Otaka et al., 1995). L-2-amino-4-phosphono-4, 4-difluoro-3-methylbutanoic acid (F2Pmb) can substitute for phosphothreonine, and L-2-amino-4-phosphono (difluoromethyl) phenylalanine (F2Pmp) can substitute for phosphotyrosine (Smyth et al., 1992; Akamatsu et al., 1997). Alternatively, the oxygen bridge of the natural amino acid can be replaced with a methylene group. In some embodiments, serine and threonine residues are substituted with homoserine and homothreonine residues, respectively. A phosphomimetic may also include vanadate, pyrophosphate or fluorophosphates.",

IRS proteins are adapter proteins that link signaling from upstream activators to multiple downstream effectors to modulate normal growth, metabolism, survival and differentiation. It is disclosed herein that phosphorylated IRS-2 is broadly displayed on multiple cancer types and the resulting phosphopeptide is endogenously processed and presented at levels that allow strong immune responses to be generated against it. Phosphopeptide-specific CD8+ T cells can be generated from HLA-A2 transgenic mice upon immunization with the pIRS2 phosphopeptide and these T cells are capable of recognizing and killing human melanoma and breast tumors in vitro and controlled tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model system.",

EGF activates TNS4 and down-regulates TNS3 which results in capping the tail of ITGB1. TN3 also seems to be involved in mammary cell migration and may be involved in cell migration and bone development. The Tensin 3 phosphopeptide (VMIGsPKKV, SEQ ID NO: 27) of the presently disclosed subject matter has been surprisingly discovered to be capable of inducing a strong phosphopeptide-specific memory T cell response in a patient.

To ensure efficacy, mammalian recipients should express the appropriate human HLA molecules to bind to the target peptides. Transgenic mammals can be used as recipients, for example, if they express appropriate human HLA molecules. If a mammal's own immune system recognizes a similar target peptide then it can be used as model system directly without introducing a transgene. Useful models and recipients can be at increased risk of developing metastatic cancer, such as metastatic colorectal cancer.

Antibody fragments thus include but are not limited to Fab fragments, Fab\u2032 fragments, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, Fv, and single-chain antibodies including but not limited to single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies. An antibody is said to be \u201cmonospecific\u201d if each of its paratopes is identical and/or binds to the same epitope. Similarly, \u201cbispecific\u201d or \u201cbifunctional\u201d antibodies comprise paratopes that bind to different antigens and/or epitopes.

The term \u201cHLA\u201d as used herein will be understood to refer to Human Leukocyte Antigens, which is defined as the histocompatibility antigens found in humans. As used herein, \u201cHLA\u201d is the human form of \u201cMHC\u201d. IN murine species, the MHC is referred to as the \u201cH-2\u201d complex.",

Structurally, class I molecules are heterodimers comprised of two noncovalently bound polypeptide chains, a larger \u201cheavy\u201d chain (\u03b1) and a smaller \u201clight\u201d chain (\u03b22-microglobulin or \u03b22m). The polymorphic, polygenic heavy chain (45 kDa), encoded within the MHC on chromosome human 6 is subdivided into three extracellular domains (designated 1, 2, and 3), one intracellular domain, and one transmembrane domain. The two outermost extracellular domains, 1 and 2, together form the groove that binds to antigenic peptides and/or other epitopes. Thus, interaction with the TCR occurs at this region of the protein. Domain 3 of the molecule contains the recognition site for the CD8 protein on the CTL. This interaction serves to stabilize the contact between the T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The invariant light chain (12 kDa), encoded on human chromosome 15, consists of a single, extracellular polypeptide. The terms \u201cMHC light chain\u201d, \u201c\u03b22-microglobulin\u201d, and \u201c\u03b22m\u201d are used interchangeably herein.",

Epitopic determinants typically consist of chemically active surface groups of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and generally have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody or antibody-like molecule is said to \u201cspecifically\u201d bind an antigen when the dissociation constant (Kd) is in some embodiments less than about 1 \u03bcM, in some embodiments less that about 100 nM, and in some embodiments less than about 10 nM. Interactions between antibodies and antibody-like molecules and an epitope can also be characterized by an affinity constant (Ka). In some embodiments, a Ka of less than about 107/M is considered \u201chigh affinity\u201d.",
                                "The term \u201cantibody\u201d is used in the broadest sense, and covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific and/or trispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments (including but not limited to Fab, F(ab\u2032)2 and Fv fragments) as well as antibody-like molecules provided that they exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g., antigen binding). Antibodies (Abs) and immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoproteins that in some embodiments have the same structural characteristics. The term is also meant to encompass \u201cantibody like molecules\u201d and other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily including, but not limited to T cell receptors, MHC molecules, and other polypeptides that contain one or more antigen-binding regions and/or variable regions including, but not limited to complementary determining regions (CDRs) that specifically bind the target peptides disclosed herein.",

These antibodies can mimic the specificity of a T cell receptor (TCR) but can have higher binding affinities such that the molecules can be employed as therapeutic, diagnostic, and/or research reagents. Methods of producing a T cell receptor mimic of the presently disclosed subject matter in some embodiments comprise identifying a target peptide of interest, generating and isolating CD8+ T cells specific for the target peptide, and cloning gene sequences that encode the target peptide-specific TCR.",

An effective amount of the immunogen is in some embodiments administered to a host to elicit an immune response in the host, and serum collected from the host can assayed to determine if antibodies that recognize a three-dimensional presentation of the target peptide in the binding groove of the MHC molecule have been produced. The desired antibodies can in some embodiments differentiate the target peptide/MHC complex from the MHC molecule alone, the target peptide alone, and/or a complex of MHC and an irrelevant peptide (in some embodiments, a peptide having the same amino acid composition as a target peptide but wherein the amino acids are in a different order that in the target peptide). Finally, in some embodiments the desired antibodies can be isolated.",

See e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0119149, which is incorporated by reference. Such soluble TCRs can in some embodiments be conjugated to immunostimulatory peptides and/or proteins, and/or moieties such as but not limited to CD3 agonists (e.g., anti-CD3 antibodies). The CD3 antigen is present on mature human T cells, thymocytes, and a subset of natural killer cells. It is associated with the TCR and is involved in signal transduction of the TCR. Antibodies specific for the human CD3 antigen are well known. One such antibody is the murine monoclonal antibody OKT3 which was the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA. OKT3 is reported to be a potent T cell mitogen (Van Wauve, 1980; U.S. Pat. No. 4,361,539) and a potent T cell killer (Wong, 1990). Other antibodies specific for the CD3 antigen have also been reported (see PCT International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2004/106380; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0202657; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,750,325; 6,706,265; United Kingdom Patent GB 2249310A; Clark et al., 1989; U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,509; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0117102). Immune mobilizing mTCR Against Cancer (ImmTAC; Immunocore Limited, Milton Park, Abington, Oxon, United Kingdom) are bifunctional proteins that combine high-affinity monoclonal T cell receptor (mTCR) targeting with a therapeutic mechanism of action (i.e., an anti-CD3 scFv).",
                                "Native antibodies and immunoglobulins are generally heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons (Da) composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by a covalent disulfide bond. Disulfide bonds also link the heavy chains of intact antibodies, although the number of disulfide bonds between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes can vary. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains (Clothia et al., 1985; Novotny & Haber, 1985).",
                                "An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is one which has been identified and/or separated and/or recovered from a component of the environment in which it was produced or otherwise present. Contaminant components of its production environment are materials that in some embodiments interfere with diagnostic and/or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and in some embodiments can include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, an antibody can be purified as measurable by one or more of the following methods: 1) to greater than 50%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method; 2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 10 or 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator; or 3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, in some embodiments, silver stain. Isolated antibodies include an antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibodies will be prepared by a method that comprises at least one purification step.",
                                "The terms \u201cantibody mutant\u201d and \u201cantibody variant\u201d refer to antibodies that relative to a reference antibody comprise one or more amino acid sequence differences, wherein one or more of the amino acid residues have been modified such as but not limited to substitution and/or deletion. Such mutants and/or variants comprise in some embodiments less than 100%, 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, or 75% sequence identity and/or similarity to the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain amino acid sequence of the reference antibody.",
                                "The term \u201cvariable\u201d in the context of variable domain of antibodies, refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, sequence variability is generally not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. Typically, sequence variability is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions (CDRs; also known as hypervariable regions) both in the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.",
                                "There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al., 1991); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Chothia et al., 1989). The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al., 1991) The constant domains are generally not involved directly in binding between antibody and antigen, but exhibit various effector functions such as but not limited to participation of the antibody in antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.",
                                "The term \u201cantibody fragment\u201d refers to a portion of a full-length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, and Fv fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called the Fab fragment, each with a single antigen binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, so-called for its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab\u2032)2 fragment that has two antigen binding fragments which are capable of cross-linking antigen, and a residual other fragment (which is termed pFc\u2032). As used herein, the phrase \u201cfunctional fragment\u201d with respect to antibodies refers in some embodiments to a fragment that contains at least one antigen-binding domain (referred to as a \u201cparatope\u201d), and thus includes, but is not limited to Fv, F(ab) and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments.",
                                "An \u201cFv\u201d fragment is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a heterodimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in a tight, non-covalent or covalent association (VH-VL dimer). It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site (paratope) on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six CDRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, in some embodiments even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.",
                                "The Fab or F(ab) fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains have a free thiol group. F(ab\u2032) fragments are produced by cleavage of the disulfide bond at the hinge cysteines of the F(ab\u2032)2 pepsin digestion product. Additional chemical couplings of antibody fragments are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.",
                                "The light chains of antibodies (immunoglobulin) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (\u03ba) and lambda (\u03bb), based on the amino sequences of the corresponding constant domain.",
                                "Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domain of their heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are at least five (5) major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses or isotypes (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, etc.). The heavy chains constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha (\u03b1), delta (\u0394), epsilon (\u03b5), gamma (\u03b3), and mu (\u03bc), respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.",
                                "The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that can be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In additional to their specificity, monoclonal antibodies can be advantageous in that they are typically synthesized from hybridomas and thus can be isolated in a form that is uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. Methods for generating hybridomas are known in the art. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. By way of example and not limitation, monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter can be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler & Milstein, 1975, or can be made by recombinant methods (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Harlow & Lane, 1988). In some embodiments, the monoclonal antibodies for use with the presently disclosed subject matter can be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., 1991 and/or Marks et al., 1991.",
                                "Utilization of the monoclonal antibodies of the presently disclosed subject matter can in some embodiments comprise administering one or more monoclonal antibodies to a subject, such as but not limited to a human subject. However, when the monoclonal antibodies are produced in a non-human animal, such as a rodent, administration of such antibodies to a human patient can elicit an immune response, wherein the immune response is directed towards the administered antibodies themselves. Such reactions can limit the duration and effectiveness of such a therapy. In order to overcome such a problem, the monoclonal antibodies of the presently disclosed subject matter can in some embodiments be \u201chumanized\u201d, that is, the antibodies are engineered such that antigenic portions thereof are removed and like portions of a human antibody are substituted therefor, while the antibodies' affinity for specific peptide/MHC complexes is retained. This engineering can involve a few amino acids, or can include the entire framework regions of the antibody, leaving only the complementarity determining regions of the parent antibody intact. Several methods of humanizing antibodies are known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,370; 6,054,927; 5,869,619; 5,861,155; 5,712,120; and 4,816,567, the entire disclosure of each of which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                                "Humanized forms of antibodies are thus chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2 or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that are principally comprised of the sequence of a human immunoglobulin, but that contain at least some subsequences derived from a non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization can be performed following the method of Winter and co-workers by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (Jones et al., 1986; Riechmann et al., 1988; Verhoeyen et al., 1988; see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539). In some embodiments, Fv framework residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with corresponding non-human residues from an antibody of interest. Humanized antibodies can also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin (Jones et al., 1986; Riechmann et al., 1988; and Presta, 1992).",

For example, a treatment protocol that can be utilized in such a method includes a single dose, generally administered intravenously, of 10-20 mg of humanized mAb per kg (see e.g., Sandborn et al., 2001). In some cases, alternative dosing patterns can be appropriate, such as the use of three infusions, administered once every two weeks, of 800-1600 mg or even higher amounts of humanized mAb (see e.g., Richards et al., 1999). However, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not limited to the treatment protocols described herein, and further that other treatment protocols that are known to one of ordinary skill in the art can be employed in the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter.",
                                "In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter further relates to fully human monoclonal antibodies against specific target peptide/MHC complexes. Fully human antibodies essentially relate to antibody molecules in which the entire sequence of both the light chain and the heavy chain, including the CDRs, arise from human genes.

No. 4,714,681; PCT International Patent Application Publication No. WO 1999/047929); the human B-cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor et al., 1983), and/or the EBV hybridoma technique (see Cole et al., 1985). In some embodiments, human monoclonal antibodies can be utilized in the practice of the presently disclosed subject matter and can be produced by using human hybridomas (see Cote et al., 1983) or by transforming human B-cells with Epstein Barr Virus in vitro (see Cole et al., 1985). In addition, human antibodies can also be produced using additional techniques, such as but not limited to phage display libraries (Hoogenboom et al., 1991; Marks et al., 1991). Similarly, human antibodies can be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. Upon challenge, human antibody production is observed, which closely resembles that seen in humans in all respects, including gene rearrangement, assembly, and antibody repertoire. This approach is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,661,016, and in Marks et al., 1992; Lonberg et al., 1994; Fishwild et al., 1996; Neuberger, 1996; and Lonberg & Huszar, 1995.",

See PCT International Patent Application Publication No. WO 1994/02602. In some embodiments, endogenous genes encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains present in the non-human animal have been deleted or otherwise inactivated, and nucleic acids encoding human heavy and light chain immunoglobulins have been inserted into the host's genome. The human genes are incorporated, for example, using yeast artificial chromosomes containing the requisite human DNA segments. An animal that provides all the desired modifications is then obtained as progeny by crossbreeding intermediate transgenic animals containing fewer than the full complement of the modifications.",

The antibodies can be obtained directly from the animal after immunization with an immunogen of interest, as, for example, a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, or alternatively from immortalized B cells derived from an immunized animal, such as hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, the genes encoding the immunoglobulins with human variable regions can be recovered and expressed to obtain the antibodies directly and/or can be further modified to obtain analogs of antibodies such as, for example, single chain Fv molecules.",

Such a non-human animal can be obtained by a method that comprises deleting the J segment genes from at least one endogenous heavy chain locus in an embryonic stem cell, thereby preventing rearrangement of the locus and formation of an RNA encoding a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. In some embodiments, the deletion can be effected by a targeting vector that contains a selectable marker, Thereafter, a transgenic animal (e.g., a mouse) having somatic and germ cells containing the gene encoding the selectable marker can be produced from the embryonic stem cell. The transgenic animal would be expected to be unable to rearrange its endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, and thus would be expected to be unable to produce endogenous immunoglobulins.",

This modification is of particular relevance because it is associated with a variety of cellular control processes, some of which are dysregulated in cancer cells.

Thus, post-translationally modified phosphopeptides that are differentially displayed on cancer cells and derived from source proteins objectively linked to cellular transformation and metastasis allow for more extensive anti-tumor responses to be elicited following vaccination. Target peptides are, therefore, better immunogens in peptide-based vaccines, as target peptides are derived from proteins involved with cellular growth control, survival, and/or metastasis, and alterations in these proteins as a mechanism of immune escape might interfere with the malignant phenotype of tumors.",

In some embodiments, such target peptides bind the MHC class I molecule more tightly than their non-phosphorylated native counterparts. Moreover, such target peptides might have additional binding strength by having amino acid substitutions at certain anchor positions. In some embodiments, such modified target peptides will remain cross-reactive with TCRs specific for native target peptide MHC complexes.",

In particular, there was a significant response (\u02dc2% of TILs, equivalent to the EBV peptide response) to the HLA-B7-associated phosphopeptide from LISCH7, which was also the most abundant phosphopeptide found on the tumor. There were, however, TIL responses from other tumors to some of the tumor-specific phosphopeptides, particularly those MHC class-I-associated phosphopeptides whose HLA specificity is unknown. These phosphopeptides have been found on many tumors from patients of differing HLA-types. Additionally, responses were seen to the phosphopeptide from RASSF6, a key oncoprotein involved in MAPK signaling, suggesting that these oncogenic proteins may be good targets for tumor immunotherapeutics."
