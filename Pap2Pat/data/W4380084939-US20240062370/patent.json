                        "Esophageal disorders can deteriorate the quality of life and in serious cases, can be life-threatening. It is therefore important to improve current diagnosis technologies for esophageal disorders. Currently, most functional diagnostic techniques like manometry are invasive, while some of the non-invasive techniques such as fluoroscopy are limited in their applicability due to their 2D visualizations. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) is a popular medical imaging technique that generates 3D image sequences of the flow of a contrast agent inside various tissues and organs and can be a better alternative to fluoroscopy. But its application to imaging bolus transport through the esophagus is relatively unexplored.",
                        "Dynamic MRI is a popular non-invasive technique for visualizing flows in tissues such as blood flow in the arteries. But it has not been applied extensively to analyze esophageal transport. This is because the dynamic MRI provides only a qualitative estimate of the nature of bolus transport by visualizing the shape of the bolus inside the esophagus. In comparison, the current invasive tests such as manometry provide quantitative estimates of esophageal function. MRI-MECH bridges this gap by providing a quantitative estimate of the state and functioning of the esophagus from MRI. These would widen the applicability of MRI machines to diagnose esophageal diseases."

In general, a machine learning model is used to process geometric or other spatiotemporal parameters of a bolus imaged with medical imaging in order to estimate quantitative parameters of the bolus and/or esophagus, such as cross-sectional area, fluid velocity, and fluid pressure. From these values, other parameters can be computed, such as esophageal stiffness and active relaxation.",

Advantageously, the proposed framework can enhance the resolution of dynamic MRI at specific locations to increase its applicability to clinical practice. The systems and methods can also be adapted to analyze tubular organs in the human body other than the esophagus.",
                        "Advantageously, the systems and methods described in the present disclosure provide a more robust analytical framework than current pure physics-based tools for analysis of esophageal transport that works with fluoroscopy, since the disclosed systems and methods can predict with missing information in the medical images.",
                        "In general, the systems and methods described in the present disclosure provide a hybrid computational framework (e.g., based on deep learning and fluid mechanics) that enhances the capability and increases the applicability of dynamic MRI, or other imaging modalities, for diagnosing esophageal disorders. As a non-limiting example, when applied to dynamic MRI, the framework may be referred to as a mechanics-informed MRI (\u201cMRI-MECH\u201d) framework. The disclosed systems and methods can predict esophageal wall properties and motility, such as active relaxation, which that locally reduces bolus pressure. Unlike other analysis techniques that work with fluoroscopy, the disclosed systems and methods also predict missing information in dynamic MRI or CT image series, thereby improving the resolution as well as the functionality of the medical imaging modality.",
                        "In a non-limiting example applied to dynamic MRI, the disclosed MRI-MECH framework is a computational framework that enhances the capability and increases the applicability of dynamic MRI for diagnosing esophageal disorders. Simple fluids, such as pineapple juice, can be used as the swallowed contrast agent for the dynamic MRI and the generated image sequence can be used as input to the MRI-MECH framework described below in more detail. The MRI-MECH framework models the esophagus as a flexible one-dimensional tube, and the flow through it is governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum conservation equations and the elastic tube walls follow a linear tube-law. These equations are solved using a physics-informed neural network (\u201cPINN\u201d). The PINN minimizes the difference between the measurements from the MRI and the predictions as well as ensures that the physics of the fluid flow problem is always followed. MRI-MECH calculates the fluid velocity and pressure during the esophageal transport, followed by the estimation of the mechanical health of the esophagus by calculating the esophageal wall stiffness and active relaxation. Additionally, MRI-MECH can also predict missing information about the lower esophageal sphincter (\u201cLES\u201d) during the esophageal emptying process, thus, demonstrating its capability of being to scenarios with missing data or poor image resolution.",
                        "Generally, the LES cross-sectional area is very difficult to visualize in MRI because it is significantly smaller than the cross-sectional area at the esophageal body. In this regard, MRI-MECH enhances the capability of the dynamic MRI by calculating the LES cross-sectional area during the esophageal emptying. The mechanics-based analysis with detailed three-dimensional visualization of the bolus in MRI leads to significantly better prediction of the state of the esophagus compared to two-dimensional x-ray imaging such as esophagram and fluoroscopy, and can be readily extended to other medical imaging techniques such as CT.",
                        "In the MRI-MECH framework described in the present disclosure, transport through the esophagus is modeled as one-dimensional fluid flow through a flexible tube. The mass and momentum conservation equations in one dimension are as follows:",

                        "where A is the cross-sectional area of the esophageal lumen, U and P are the velocity and pressure in the bolus fluid, respectively; x represents the distance along the length of the esophagus from the mouth to the stomach; and t represents time. The total time for bolus transport in an example analysis was 6.95 seconds. The quantities \u03c1 and \u03bc are the density and dynamic viscosity of the transported fluid, respectively.",
                        "The fluid pressure developed inside the esophagus is linearly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the esophageal lumen in the absence of any neuromuscular activation. Using this information, a pressure tube-law can be constructed as follows:",

Typically, the inactive cross-sectional area is in the range 7-59 mm2. In an example case, the inactive cross-sectional area, Ao, was 27 mm2. The activation parameter, \u03b8, takes the value of 1 in the inactive state of the esophagus. It can be seen from Equation 3 that in the inactive state, when the cross-sectional area of the esophageal lumen is equal to Ao, the pressure inside the esophagus is equal to Po. Due to the lack of information about the thoracic pressure, it can be assumed that Po=0 mmHg. An activation is induced when \u03b8<1, raising the pressure locally. On the other hand, \u03b8>1 decreases the bolus pressure and estimates the active relaxation of the esophageal wall. Thus, the parameter \u03b8 captures the effect of the esophageal motility.",
                        "When the dynamic MRI data have low spatial and/or temporal resolution, the dynamic MRI data can be interpolated to smaller spatial and/or temporal scales. The measured volume Vm of the bolus from the proximal end (x=0) to any point x>0 can be calculated as follows:",

                        "The boundary conditions of this problem can be specified to capture the physiological conditions of normal esophageal transport. The upper esophageal sphincter (\u201cUES\u201d) at the proximal end of the esophagus opens to allow the bolus into the esophagus, closes once the fluid has passed through it, and remains closed thereafter. Hence, zero velocity at x=0 can be specified for all time instants. This condition also ensures that Vm=0 at x=0 at all time instants and is consistent with Equations 4 and 6. The distal end of the esophagus, on the other hand, remains open to allow emptying into the stomach. Since the pressure term in Equation 2 contains a single derivative with respect to x, only one boundary condition for P needs to be specified. The boundary pressure can be specified at the distal end, which can be equal to a typical value of gastric pressure (e.g., 7 mmHg). For initial conditions, zero velocity can be set at all points along x at t=0.",
                        "Low spatial resolution the dynamic MRI can pose a problem of accurately identifying the lower esophageal sphincter (\u201cLES\u201d) cross-section. This is because the LES opening is narrower compared to the esophageal body and does not distend very much because of the greater wall stiffness at the esophagogastric junction (\u201cEGJ:). Although this could be improved by focusing the MRI only at the LES, the state of the esophagus proximal to the LES cannot be estimated in such a scenario. The LES can be identified in only one or two time instants when the LES has greatly distended due to a bolus flow through it. The LES cross-sectional area measured at this time instant can act as a valuable reference to identify the bolus behavior proximal to the LES.",
                        "As described above, since pressure can be specified as a Dirichlet boundary condition at the distal end of the esophagus, the intrabolus pressure prediction can depend on the accurate measurement of the LES cross-sectional area. FIG. 1 shows the intrabolus pressure calculated using a numerical approach with different LES cross-sectional areas. The pressure shown is non-dimensional and the pressure at the distal end was specified zero as a reference in this case. The total length of the esophagus considered here is the sum of the centerline length (9.65 cm) and the LES length (2.78 cm). Thus, the proximal and distal location of the bolus were 9.65 cm and 12.43 cm, respectively. In non-dimensional form, the proximal and distal locations were \u03c7p=6.87 and \u03c7L=8.81, respectively. The quantities \u03c7p and \u03c7L can be advantageous locations as described below. As shown in FIG. 1, the intrabolus pressure proximal to the LES depends on the LES cross-sectional area, so, assuming a constant LES cross-sectional area (measured at one time instant) would lead to an incorrect prediction, making it important to know the instantaneous LES cross-sectional area to accurately predict intrabolus as well as to understand LES functioning during emptying.",
                        "The problem of missing data for the LES cross-sectional area (and consequently obtaining accurate intrabolus pressure values) can be solved using a physics-informed neural network (\u201cPINN\u201d). The problem description is schematically shown in FIG. 2. The final interpolated volume V(x, t) was used to calculate A(x, t) and U(x, t) using Equations 5 and 6, and after non-dimensionalization, \u03b1(\u03c7, \u03c4) and u(\u03c7, \u03c4), respectively. These values of \u03b1(\u03c7, \u03c4) and u(\u03c7, \u03c4) can then used to calculate p(\u03c7r,\u03c4r) at the specific time instant when the LES cross-section was visible by solving Equation 8 using a finite volume method. The non-dimensional time, \u03c4r, corresponds to the time instant when the LES was visible in MRI. The point \u03c7r can be selected near the proximal end of the LES. This point can be selected because the pressure at points proximal to \u03c7r are of similar magnitude as p(\u03c7r,\u03c4) as shown in FIG. 1. Additionally, when \u03c7r is selected to be very close to the LES the effect of active relaxation as observed in the esophageal body can be minimal. In the example study referenced above, the values of \u03c7r and \u03c4r were 6.76 and 8.57, respectively. The pressure p(\u03c7r,\u03c4r) can be viewed as the correct estimate of the intrabolus pressure when the LES cross-sectional area is accurately known. This pressure can be referred to as the reference pressure, pr=p(\u03c7r,\u03c4r). Using the tube-law in Equation 9, the stiffness, kr, at \u03c7r can be calculated as follows:",

                        "Note that there is no \u03b8 in Equation (10) since it can be assumed that \u03b8=1 at \u03c7r. With the stiffness at \u03c7r, the pressure pt=p(\u03c7r,\u03c4) can be calculated at other times with the tube-law according to Equation 9 as follows:",

The typical length of an adult esophagus is 18-25 cm. The average velocity of a normal peristalsis is approximately 3.3 cm/s. Thus, an average swallow sequence usually takes 5-8 seconds.

This can be done in two steps. The first step is to generate a center line along the length of the esophagus. The bolus shapes observed at different time instants can be superimposed and then cross-sections of the superimposed shape at different horizontal planes from the proximal to the distal end of the superimposed shape can be generated. The centroids of these cross-sections can be connected to form the center line. The length of the center line in the example study mentioned above was 9.65 cm. In the second step, after extracting the center line, planes perpendicular to the centerline are generated, as shown in FIG. 6. The segmented voxels associated with the bolus and which lay near these perpendicular planes are projected onto these planes. These projected points can be connected using Delaunay triangulation, as shown in FIG. 6.

An example of the variation of the predicted cross-sectional area (in its dimensional form) is shown in FIG. 7A for all values of x and t. The values of the cross-sectional areas inside the bolus proximal to the LES were obtained from measurements and their prediction was based on the minimization the measurement loss as described by Equation 13.",
                        "The cross-sectional areas proximal to the bolus cannot be visualized in MRI because the fluid contrast media was completely displaced by the peristaltic contraction and the dynamic MRI cannot distinguish the esophagus from surrounding tissue. Hence, the inactive cross-sectional area, Ao, can be assigned to the esophagus proximal to the bolus. This assignment does not impact the prediction of any of the physical quantities using PINN. This is because the velocity (and flow rate) proximal to the bolus is automatically predicted as zero (as shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B) with this assignment, and since the pressure boundary condition is specified at the distal end, the pressure calculation inside the domain does not depend on the behavior proximal to the bolus. The variation of LES cross-sectional area can be seen below the dashed line in FIG. 7A. The LES cross-sectional area does not vary along x and only varies along t. This is because the constraint as described in Equation 12 has been enforced.",
                        "The variation of the LES cross-sectional area is shown more clearly in FIG. 7B. The prediction of Ales depends on the reference LES cross-sectional area observed at a single time instant, the conservation laws, and the reference pressure prediction at \u03c7r. Ales has the greatest magnitude near the instant when the LES cross-sectional area was observed in the MRI and has lesser values farther away from that instant. This matches the observation from the MRI images that the LES could not be visualized most of the time. Hence, since the effectiveness of esophageal transport depends on how effectively the esophagus empties, the LES cross-sectional area is an important physiomarker of esophageal function. Greater LES cross-sectional area facilitates esophageal emptying while it is becomes unnecessary for the LES to have large cross-sectional area when the bolus has almost completely emptied. Similar LES behavior can be observed in FIG. 7B where it was greater during the emptying process and minimal when bolus emptying was nearly complete.",
                        "The variation of bolus fluid velocity and flow rate are shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, respectively. It can be seen that there are two major high-velocity zones. The first high-velocity zone is near x=6 cm and t=2 sec. Comparing this region with the FIG. 7A it can be observed that the cross-sectional area at that location and time was less than at its adjacent regions. The second high-velocity zone was in the LES. This corresponds to low cross-sectional area as well. Thus, the velocities are greater at lower cross-sectional areas which is intuitive for low viscosity fluids. The flow rate is the rate at which the bolus is emptied out of the esophagus and zones with high flow rate are similar to those with high-velocity. However, there is a smoother transition of flow rate from the esophageal body to the LES compared to the velocity field. This is because the LES cross-sectional area was much smaller than that of the esophageal body requiring that the fluid velocity needed to increase more to maintain the same flow rate.",
                        "The variation of fluid pressure is shown in FIG. 9. The pressure gradients along x drives the fluid through the esophagus. On comparing FIG. 8A and FIG. 9, it can be seen that the high-pressure gradients match the high-velocity zones. This is because the high-pressure gradients locally accelerate the fluid. Note that the pressure variations are minimal compared to the magnitudes of the pressure. An intragastric pressure of 7 mmHg was used as a boundary condition for pressure at the distal end which is in the normal range for a healthy subject. The thoracic pressure was assumed to be 0 mmHg. Thus, the intrabolus pressure should be greater than the intragastric pressure to empty into the stomach. The major portion of this pressure (\u02dc7 mmHg) is developed by the elastic distention of the esophageal walls. A small portion of the total intrabolus pressure (\u02dc0.01 mmHg) is attributable to the local acceleration or deceleration of the bolus fluid. Since the MRI shows only the movement within an already distended esophagus, the calculated pressure variations are minimal and correspond to local acceleration or deceleration of the fluid.",
                        "Esophageal wall stiffness (along with the effect of active relaxation) was estimated by the parameter K/\u03b8. The minimum value of K/\u03b8 corresponds to the lower bound of the effective stiffness of the esophageal walls when distended. Since the cross-sectional area of the esophagus is not visible in MRI, any prediction regarding the stiffness at those locations would be inaccurate. Hence, predictions of wall stiffness can be made at regions where the esophagus is distended (e.g., at the location of the bolus). However, the distended esophageal walls also undergo active relaxation to accommodate an incoming bolus as well as minimize intrabolus pressure. The combined behavior of the passive elastic distention of the esophageal walls and active relaxation is captured by the parameter K/\u03b8.",
                        "Since K/\u03b8 as described by Equation 27 estimates the lower bound of the effective esophageal stiffness, the most accurate estimate of K/\u03b8 occurs when the esophageal walls are most distended. The maximum distension corresponds to the minimum value of K/\u03b8, which is shown in FIG. 10. The minimum K/\u03b8 at each x was calculated for all values of t. Note that the high value of (K/\u03b8)min near x=6 cm in FIG. 10 matches with the low cross-sectional area region in FIG. 7A. This makes sense because the esophagus would distend less at locations of greater stiffness. It should be noted that although the stiffness appears high at x=6 cm, it is does not necessarily mean that the esophageal tissue is stiffer at that location. When the esophageal wall comes in contact with surrounding organs, it appears stiffer due to the effect of those organs on the esophagus.",
                        "The parameter \u03b8 quantifies the amount of active relaxation of the esophageal walls to facilitate distention, and consequently, decrease the local intrabolus pressure and increase the flow rate. The variation of the active relaxation parameter \u03b8 is shown in FIG. 11. As described by Equation 28 and comparing FIG. 11 and FIG. 7A, it can be seen that the locations of the high values of \u03b8 match the location of the high values of A, and, similarly lower values of \u03b8 match the lower values of A. Note that \u03b8 quantifies the active relaxation in the esophageal body and not the LES. Comparing FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 shows that locations of greater stiffness correspond to locations of lower active relaxation and vice-versa. Similar to (K/\u03b8)min as described above, the impact of tissues and organs outside the esophagus impacts the prediction of \u03b8 as well. Hence, the low value of \u03b8 near x=6 cm does not necessarily mean a lack of active relaxation, but most likely the influence of structures outside the esophagus. Hence, it is contemplated that the greater values of active relaxation are closer to the actual active relaxation of the esophageal walls.",

A differentiating feature of the 3D U-Net is that instead of operating on the 2D images that the U-Net expects as input, the former operates on volumetric (3D) data. Automatic segmentation using the 3D U-Net is viable due to the repetitiveness of the structures and variations of the input images, especially for volumetric biomedical data.",

To prepare the training masks, segmentation via manual delineation is performed, where voxels in the images were given a label of 1 if they were determined to be part of a bolus, and 0 if they were not. For the benchmark case, the images were manually segmented with intervals of 2, 4, and 2 slices respectively in the x, y, and z directions. In order to determine the effects of the sparsity of the annotation on the training of the model as well as the accuracy of the prediction, manual segmentations were made on the same set of images using the same method, except with intervals in the x, y, and z directions of (4, 8, 4), (4, 8, 8), in addition to a training set with only one segmentation slice in each direction to represent a more extreme case of sparse annotation. Another image/mask set was used for validation during training, and the 7th set was for testing to compare prediction accuracy among the different cases. The amount of data used in the training of the model is adequate, as in many biomedical volumetric image classification situations, only two images are required to attain reasonable accuracy, along with a weighted loss function and data augmentation.",

                        "For the segmentation problem, the weighted Sorensen Dice Coefficient was used to measure the similarity between the predictions and the training set. The weighted dice coefficient loss was used as the loss function during training.",
                        "Several hyperparameter tuning trials were conducted to find the optimal hyperparameters and conditions for training the model. Through experimentation, it was found that training for 1000 epochs with an initial learning rate of 10-2 using a learning rate scheduler to decrease the learning rate by a factor of 3 every 250 epochs proved to be the most reliable. The training was conducted using Keras, a high level neural network API of TensorFlow, and the optimization algorithm used was stochastic gradient descent (SGD). A maximum weighted dice coefficient of 0.8575 was attained at epoch 282 during training. The predictions were converted to their binary forms with voxels with values greater than 0.05 classified as 1 (bolus), and those equal to or below 0.05 is set to 0 (background).",
                        "Retaining the same hyperparameters, trials were also run with different levels of annotation sparsity. Denoting the number of slices in the x, y, and z directions as (Nx, Ny, Nz), the benchmark trial had (2,4,2), and saw a final validation weighted dice coefficient of 0.7679. The final weighted dice coefficient for the (4,8,8), (4,8,4), and (1,1,1) cases were respectively 0.4608, 0.5289, and 0.3655. Thus, in this trial, the benchmark case of (2,4,2) yielded the highest accuracy.",
