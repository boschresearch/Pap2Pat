    "title": "In vitro testing of a funnel-shaped tip catheter model to decrease clot migration during mechanical thrombectomy",
    "date": "2020-01-20",
    "abstract": "One limitation of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is clot migration during procedure. This might be caused by abruption of the trapped thrombus at the distal access catheter (DAC) tip during stent-retriever retraction due to the cylindrical shaped tip of the DAC. Aiming to solve this problem, this study evaluates the proof-of-concept of a new designed funnel-shaped tip, in an experimental in vitro setting. Two catheter models, one with a funnel-shaped tip and one with a cylindrical-shaped tip, were compared in an experimental setup. For MT a self-made vessel model and thrombi generated from pig\u2019s blood were used. MT was performed 20 times for each device using two different stent-retrievers, 10 times respectively. For the funnel-shaped model: for both stent-retrievers (Trevo XP ProVue 3/20 mm; Trevo XP ProVue 4/20 mm) MT was successful at first pass in 9/10 (90%), respectively. For the cylindrical-shaped model: MT was successful at first pass in 5/10 (50%) with the smaller stent-retriever and in 6/10 (60%) with the larger stent-retriever. The experiments show a better recanalization rate for funnel-shaped tips, than for cylindrical-shaped tips. These results are indicating a good feasibility for this new approach, thus the development of a prototype catheter seems reasonable.",

                "Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has become the standard technique in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in large vessel occlusion (LVO). Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated a safe and efficient use of MT in comparison to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) use alone1\u20136.",
                "Recently updated international and national guidelines7,8 recommend MT for patients suffering from acute stroke up to 24\u2009hours after the onset of symptoms, as well as for patients with wake-up strokes with an unknown time window, thus emphasizing the increasing relevance of endovascular treatment. The so-called \u201cbig five\u201d1\u20135 reports for MT in LVO show a good recanalization rate of 71%. A meta-analysis of 12 studies reports a successful recanalization rate (TICI 2b/3 score) of 81% for MT with stent- retriever in acute M2 occlusion9. Different techniques are possible for MT, like Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique (ADAPT), Stent-retriever Assisted Vacuum-locked Extraction (SAVE) or primary combined approach (PCA) of an aspiration catheter and stent-retriever6,10.",
                "Even though MT in combination with IVT is the state-of-the-art treatment for LVO, there are still limitations. Balami et al.11 report an embolization to new vascular territories in 1\u20138.6% for most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in 1\u201312.5% for the non-RCTs. This can be caused by clot migration to proximal vessels during the retraction of the stent-retriever or persistence in the same vessel. Furthermore, the clot can break and dissipate in multiple smaller vessel branches during the procedure12. The risk of embolization to a new territory (ENT) increases during MT of a proximal clot13.",
                "A different reason for clot migration or fragmentation might be the distal shape (tip shape) of the DAC, which is cylindrical in the commonly used DACs. Parts of the clot might abrupt at the DAC\u2019s wall during retraction of the stent-retriever and dissipate into distal vessels, causing ENT. Even though flow arrest with an inflated balloon guide catheter (BGC) is frequently applied during MT14, a distal blood flow may remain, increasing the risk of dissipation of the broken clot with the blood flow into peripheral small branches.",
                "To improve recanalization rates and to overcome the well-known limitations of endovascular MT, different alternative techniques for mechanical thrombectomy have been proposed and tested6,10. However, to the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated differently shaped tips of the DAC.",
                "This study is evaluating the proof-of-concept of a funnel-shaped tip in an experimental in-vitro setting, using thrombi made from pig\u2019s blood and a shortened intravenous (IV) line as a middle cerebral artery (MCA) model. Recanalization rates and clot migration were assessed and compared with MT results of a cylindrical-shaped tip.",
                "This future catheter could either fit into commercially used, cylindrical shaped DACs such that the funnel shaped tip will be released at the distal end of the DAC as soon the catheter is outside of DAC\u2019s lumen.",
                "Or the catheter itself is used as a DAC and a flexible cover is used to hold the cylindrical shaped tip in place until the occluded vessel is reached. Once the occluded vessel is reached, the cover might be removed and the funnel shaped tip released."

One limitation of MT is clot fragmentation and migration.Our approach to improve MT at first pass and to hinder clot fragmentation is to modify the established cylindrical-shaped tip of DACs into a self-expanding funnel-shaped tip.",
                "The development of a prototype is cost-intensive and preliminary research results are needed to find a partner interested in the idea and to support further product development. Therefore, an experimental in vitro set-up was used for proof- of principle, hereby respecting and reflecting the diameters of a real catheter and cerebral blood vessels. The inner diameter of a standard DAC (e.g. SOFIA\u00ae, MicroVention Inc. Aliso Viejo, California, USA, with 5F (ID 1.39\u2009mm (0.055 inch) or 6F 1.78\u2009mm (0.070 inch), is reflected by the used model (cylindrical tip: 1.5\u2009mm). Average diameter of the MCA is reported with 2.5\u20133\u2009mm in the literature22, this was reflected by the study concept (funnel shape with 2.5\u2009mm and silicon tube (simulating a vessel) with 3\u2009mm diameter.",
                "Commercially available 3D silicon MCA models could not be used since vessel lengths of anatomical models distinctly exceed the length of the introducer sheaths used for MT. In comparison to a standard, cylindrical-shaped tip, the novel funnel-shaped tip showed promising advantages in the study at hand. We observed a 90% recanalization rate at first-pass, showing no abruption of the clot at the model wall, regardless of the stent-retriever size. MT failed two times, however not due to abruption of the clot but rather to a thrombus loss during stent retraction before reaching the tip. In our in vitro setting we could observe that the thrombus was not trapped sufficiently in the stent-retriever. This might happen during real MT as well. The cylindrical-shaped tip showed lower recanalization rates, with 50% for the smaller stent-retriever size (3/20\u2009mm) and 60% for the larger stent-retriever size (4/20\u2009mm). In four, respectively in two cases, the clot was lost due to abruption at the DAC wall. We were able to observe that in larger stent-retrievers the number of exceeding parts of the clot was less than in smaller stent-retrievers. This might change depending on the size of the clot. Since the clot size in the study at hand was standardized to 20.0\u2009mm (length) \u00d7 0.8\u2009mm (diameter), an increased overlap of clot for the smaller stent-retriever was observed leading to higher potentials of clot abruption, which is emphasized by our results (4 times abruption of the clot with the 3/20\u2009mm stent- retriever vs. 2 times with the 4/20\u2009mm).",
                "The catheter model used in this study was not tested in terms of navigation. Thinking of a funnel-shaped tip, it might be difficult and dangerous to reach the target vessel. Two options to reach the cerebral vessel might be possible. Firstly a thin cover (like a guide catheter) could be an option to hold the self expanding funnel shaped tip in place, until the target vessel is reached. After the catheter has been positioned, the cover could be retracted and the funnel shape could be released, hereby occluding the vessel. The self-expanding power ensures a flexible shape, which can adapt to various vessel diameters, hereby sealing the vessel lumen and preventing clot fragments from stripping off during retraction of the stent-retriever. The funnel-shaped tip will be foldable, using the guide catheter, if the DAC has to be repositioned. This ensures a save transportation to even distal blood vessels with small lumen without damaging the vessel walls. Alternatively the commonly used DAC might be the guiding catheter for the self-expanding funnel shaped tip. After the stent retriever is released, the funnel shaped tip catheter could reach the target vessel, through the standard DAC and when the DAC is removed, the funnel shape will be released. With this no navigation would be necessary and the normal DAC itself could be used as a sheath. Both options might be assessed, when a prototype catheter is eligible for in vitro and in vivo experiments.",
                "The application of a funnel-shaped aspiration catheter may also be beneficial during acute thromboembolic occlusion of vessels other than cerebral arterial vessels, like mesenteric arteries. Commonly, no stent-retriever is used during endovascular recanalization in acute mesenterial ischemia; the clot is removed through aspiration with a so called aspiration catheter, only23. The use of an aspiration catheter with a self-expanding funnel-shaped tip would occlude the vessel, enabling easier aspiration and diminishing the risk of clot migration. This hypothesis has not been evaluated yet and has to be tested in in vitro and in vivo settings with a prototype.",
                "A general limitation of the study is the single in vitro experimental setting, with missing in vivo experiments. The reason for this is the not yet feasible prototype of the novel DAC for in vivo experiments. To show the safety and the efficiency of our proposed modification and before using the new funnel-shaped tip DAC in humans, further in vitro and in vivo animal studies are needed.",
                "Additionally, only one clot type was used, with high proportion of fibrin. Since different clot types and clot sizes may have an influence on recanalization rates and clot migration, different clot types have to be included in further studies. Apart from that, in patients with acute ischemic LVO recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is applied intravenously before endovascular treatment, which can change clot character. The influence of rtPA during MT using a funnel shaped DAC, has to be evaluated in future studies.",
                "The limited number of attempts and the evaluation of only one MT technique (PCA), limited this study. A restricted amount of pig\u2019s blood available allowed only the production of a small amount of thrombi. Therefore, we decided to evaluate only one the combined MT technique.",
