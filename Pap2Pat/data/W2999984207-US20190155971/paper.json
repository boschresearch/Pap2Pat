    "date": "2020-01-01",
    "abstract": "We developed a simple and efficient way to simulate stress from arbitrary shape dislocations within the finite element method (FEM) framework. The new method is implemented as a single-step FEM simulation using analytic solutions in an infinite medium as input terms of FEM solver with special internal boundary treatment. It is fundamentally equivalent to the multistep \u201cimage method\u201d proposed by Van der Giessen and Needleman [Modell. Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 3, 689 (1995)], but the force equilibration is achieved by a single step FEM method. The singularity at the dislocation core line is removed without mesh modification, which removes many technical difficulties to couple the dislocation stress model to other process/device simulation models.",

                "Mechanical stress plays an important role in both detrimental 1 and beneficial 2,3 ways in modern semiconductor device fabrication and, thus, improving stress simulation capability, especially dislocation stress model, has been of great interest in the technology computer-aided design (TCAD) community for decades. However, there has been no practical dislocation stress simulation methodology applicable to routine semiconductor modeling activity.",
                "In principle, solving stress distribution generated by dislocations is Eshelby's inclusion problem, 4 which has a history longer than a half century. Zhou et al. 5 provided a review on the research history of the inclusion problem. Early research on the inclusion problem focused on the analytic solution in special geometries and boundary conditions. In 1993, Lubarda et al. reduced Eshelby's inclusion problem in a finite size domain with traction-free boundary conditions to a boundary value problem, 6 which was extended to the general boundary conditions by Van der Giessen and Needleman 7 and led to several different types of finite element method (FEM) solutions. [8][9][10][11] To our knowledge, four major FEM methodologies have been published so far for dislocation stress simulation in a multidomain structure. The first method by Van der Giessen needs four calculation steps: (1) calculate analytic solution in the region, \u2126 1 in Fig. 1, enclosing a dislocation and the accompanied Volterra cutplane, 12 (2) solve FEM for the remaining region \u2126 2 in Fig. 1 with the displacement boundary condition at the interface, (3) calculate the sum of traction from the previous steps and solve FEM equations by applying the negative traction to the interface, and (4) sum up solutions from all the previous steps. Although the idea is straightforward, solving FEM stress equations in subdomains of a complex structure separately with the specified boundary conditions and merging the results require complicated correction processes depending on the configuration of the external boundary and internal interfaces. 8 The second method is to insert an \"eigenstrain\" inclusion plate and let boundary conditions be taken care of by the FEM solver. 9,13 Although this method can successfully calculate the stress distribution in a complex structure, it still has a limitation for practical application because defining a thin region and refining mesh are time-consuming and can cause bad convergence. In addition, it is hard to superpose multiple dislocations. In the third  "

Their method also requires a special mesh prepared by users to avoid singularity near the dislocation core line. Finally, the extended-FEM (XFEM) uses displacement discontinuity at the Volterra cut-plane, which requires a significant change to the standard FEM. 11 Other variations such as \"homogenization method\" 14 and \"thermoanalog model\" 15 also require strain averaging and fine regular mesh preparation, respectively, near the Volterra cut-plane. All four methods produce good results for the tested structures, but they require either special mesh preparation or significant extension to the standard FEM, which can be a hurdle in coupling the dislocation stress model to other general semiconductor process/device simulation models. Therefore, we developed a simple and efficient method compatible with the standard FEM."

The displacement continuation at the internal boundary is critical to get the correct stress distribution from dislocations. A different boundary condition, \u0394\u03b5 continuation, where \u03b5 is the strain, is used for most other cases to keep the process history during multistep process simulations. For example, when a new amorphous layer is deposited on top of stress equilibrated layers containing dislocations, dislocation stress will not affect the new layer.
