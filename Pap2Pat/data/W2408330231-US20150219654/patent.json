    "abstract": "This invention relates to substrates and methods for the visualization of intracellular organelles, such as the lysosome, peroxiosome, nucleus, Endoplasmic Reticulum and Golgi Apparatus, based upon organelle enzyme activity. Such compounds represent a novel combination of chemically distinct enzyme substrates with targeting and detection substrates which are activated by enzyme activity inside target organelles to produce a detectable signal. The organelle targeted enzyme substrates of this invention are designed to provide high fluorescence at lower pH values found in some organelles and can be used for monitoring enzyme activity inside cells at very low concentrations.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Acidic organelles are present in all cells and tissues of mammalian, plant, yeast and fungal cells, except red blood cells. Many bacteria also contain acidic compartments. These acidic organelles are often involved in metabolism and catabolism of foreign molecules that are brought into the cell by endocytosis. They are often the first line of defense against foreign bacterial or viral infection. The acidic pH of endosomes is critical to the process by which lipid-enveloped viruses enter the cytoplasm after their cellular uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process where extra cellular particles such as bacteria, are engulfed in the cell and then fused to lysosomes for digestion. Acidic organelles have also been shown to be responsible for digestion of high molecular weight proteins, oligosaccharides, glycolipids or peptides by the cell. In addition, they are often involved in therapeutic drug metabolism. Among the cellular organelles that have been found to mediate their enzyme activities by acidification are lysosomes, acidic endosomes, phagosomes, clathrin-coated vesicles and Golgi vescicles.",
                        "The Golgi Apparatus and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) are dynamic organelles involved in the synthesis, processing and sorting of cellular proteins and lipids. The Golgi and ER are also involved in a great number of cellular processes including proprotein activation, glycoconjugate modification, glycolipid synthesis, phosphorylation and sulfation of proteins and sugars as well as sorting and trafficking of newly synthesized proteins internally or as part of the secretory pathway. Both organelles have been implicated in defense against pathogens, cholesterol homeostasis, metabolism, apoptosis and cell signaling. As such, the Golgi and the ER contain a great number of metabolic and regulatory enzymes that are involved in ordered function and processing of nearly all proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in the cell. And more information is continually accumulating that functional deficiencies or mutations in these enzymes are indicative of a number of disease states, particularly those that affect the nervous system such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, ALS, Lowe Syndrome, I Cell Disease, Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy, Adrenoleukodystrophy, Niemann-Pick Disease, Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Mannosidosis and Cystic Fibrosis as well as proliferative diseases, viral infections and neoplastic growth and metastasis.",
                        "Prior stains, methods and assays for visualizing acidic organelles are not useful for monitoring enzyme activities in living cells. For example, weakly basic amines have been shown to selectively accumulate in cellular compartments with low internal pH. When further linked to chromogenic or fluorogenic probes, they can be used to label these compartments. Among these is the frequently used acidotropic probe, N-(3-((2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino)propyl)-N-(3-aminopropyl)methylamine, dihydrochloride (hereafter referred to as DAMP). The fluorescent dyes neutral red and acridine orange are also commonly used for staining acidic organelles, but they lack specificity and are not well retained in the organelles, particularly after fixing and permeabilization.",
                        "In particular, methods to analyze Golgi aid ER enzyme functional activity within living cells have been hampered by the inability to monitor such activity inside individual organelles. The instant invention intends to address this problem by the use of new, organelle-targeted, live-cell assay systems for Golgi and ER enzyme activities that can be used for discovery and testing of new therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative, proliferative, cardiac diseases or infections. Many ER and Golgi enzymes are under investigation as drug targets for affecting intracellular processing and synthesis mechanisms and thereby provide novel therapeutics for the mentioned and other related diseases.",
                        "Tools for staining the Golgi or ER using fluorescence microscopy include recombinant fluorescent proteins that have luminal targeting peptide sequences for the Golgi and ER as well as dye derivatives (e.g. Brefeldin A (BFA) conjugates) that are selectively localized on the cytosolic face of the Golgi and ER in many different cell lines. The peptide sequences identified to target recombinant proteins have also been used to target fluorophores to the Golgi and ER in live cell assays. These dyes are retained in the Golgi and ER due to the presence of specific C-terminal signal sequences such as KDEL (SEQ ID NO:1) or SDYQRL (SEQ ID NO:2) or related sequences that are inserted into the luminal face of the ER or trans-Golgi network. Fluorescently labeled peptides containing these sequences can visualize intracellular processes and molecular interactions at a single-cell level. Protein systems containing these targeting sequences have been used to measure the intra-organelle pH of the ER and Golgi (Wu, et al., 2000). Many other peptide sequences have also been identified for targeting to other organelle structures within living cells. The present invention proposes to utilize these established systems to target fluorogenic enzyme substrates to specific organelles for live-cell analysis of enzyme activity.",
                        "The present invention utilizes fluorogenic enzyme substrates for the labeling and tracing metabolic and defective activities in these organelles in live cells or in cell-free systems. These new substrates selectively accumulate in cellular compartments based upon selective targeting sequences and can be used to investigate the enzyme levels responsible for biosynthesis, degradation and recycling of cellular components and for measuring specific enzyme defects involved in a number of human diseases linked to enzyme activity in particular organelles within live cells.",
                        "Peptide motifs that can be used to target proteins or even small molecules to various locations within cells are known in the art. For example, the nuclear targeting sequence from the SV40 large T antigen PKKKRKV SEQ ID NO:3 has been used to localize exogenously delivered macromolecular conjugates to live cells as well as recombinant proteins expressed after plasmid or viral DNA transfection/transduction.",
                        "Peptide localization motifs have also been described for organelles other than the nucleus. For example, the four amino acid sequence KDEL (SEQ ID NO:1) at the amino terminus of a protein is a well-established ER-retention sequence while the carboxy-terminal sequence of amino acids containing SKL has been identified for peroxisomal targeting. These and other targeting sequences have been used for fluorescent labeling of specific organelles in live cells as an orthogonal method to cell staining by conjugation to small molecule organic dyes. These peptide sequences are known to be actively transported into living cells by the method of retrograde transport",
                        "Recently these same peptide motifs have been cloned into fluorescent proteins for specific staining of individual organelles when expressed inside living cells. While such targeting peptides or proteins have been used as research tools for staining specific organelles their potential for real time analysis of enzyme activity within living cells or tissues remains unexplored.",
                        "The organelle targeted enzyme substrates of this invention are designed to provide high fluorescence at lower pH values found in some organelles and contain further derivatized groups to support membrane permeation through both outer and organelle membranes of intact cells. They can be used for monitoring enzyme activity in cells at very low concentrations and are not toxic to living cells or tissues. The instant dyes, substrates and methods for their use are described herein for investigating metabolism, monitoring enzyme activities associated with diseases, for analysis of the biogenesis or degenerative states of organelles, the development of, investigating development of cells or cultured neurons, and detecting pH gradients. The current invention is also useful for labeling non-mammalian cells that possess the targeted organelles, including bacteria, yeast, spermatozoa and plant cells, or for the labeling and analysis of enzyme activity in symbiotic or invasive bacterial species that predominantly partitions to specific organelles within living cells."

Chem. 272: 19554-19561; Majoul I V, Bastiaens P I, S\u00f6ling H D (1996) J. Cell Biol. 133(4):777-789.]",
                        "The staining characteristics of the preferred substrates are generally not reversed or are only partially reversed by subsequent treatment of the cells with additional cell-permeant compounds. In some cases, the staining is preserved even after fixation and/or permeabilization of the cells. The examples indicate the permanence of the staining parameters available to the practitioner practicing the invention.",
                        "The probes of the present invention are utilized by preparing a labeling solution containing one or more of the dyes of the present application, introducing the labeling solution into the sample containing or thought to contain the specific organelle and enzyme(s), incubating the sample for a time sufficient to produce a detectable fluorescent staining pattern, and observing or analyzing the staining pattern in the sample. The sample may be a cell or cells that contain organelles or the sample may contain isolated organelles (i.e. not incorporated in a cell), or the sample may be two solutions separated by a semi-permeable membrane.",
                        "The degree of staining of the organelles is a reflection of the enzyme activity in the organelle at the time of staining, i.e., the degree of staining is indicative of whether or not the organelle contains the enzyme at the time of staining, the amount of enzyme that is present, and the performance of the enzyme (enzyme function) as well as the length of the labeling time (enzyme kinetics). The analysis of mutations in enzymes due to genetic diseases is a specific embodiment of the present invention. While the dyes of the present invention are typically used for staining the organelles of live cells, the present invention is also useful for staining isolated (i.e. cell-free) organelles, provided the organelles are not disrupted and the enzyme still exists and is active in the isolated organelle or in the medium in which it is suspended. While in general the presence of organelles can be considered an indicator of cell viability, it is possible to render a cell non-viable, while still retaining organelles in the sample (cell fixation). The substrates of the present invention may also be useful in the analysis of enzyme activity when staining is followed by lysis of the cell and analysis of the fluorescent or chromogenic signal using standard techniques (e.g. fluorescence microtiterplate reader, fluorometers, UV/Vis spectrometer).",
                        "Furthermore, the substrates of the present invention can be made from fluorescent dyes that have the property of modifying their fluorescence spectrum as a function of pH upon enzyme turnover. Among the reporter dyes that exhibit changes in signal dependent upon the pH environment at the site of activity are the courmarins, fluoresceins, naphthfluoresceins, carbocyanines and rhodamines.",
                        "Preparation of a Labeling Solution",
                        "The pure substrates may have limited solubility in water at high concentrations. Typically a stock solution is prepared by dissolving a known mass of the pure substrate in an organic solvent and then diluting this stock solution with buffer or media for live cell analysis. Preferred organic solvents for preparation of the stock solutions are DMSO, DMF, N-methylpyrrolidone, acetone, acetonitrile, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methanol or ethanol or other completely water-miscible solvents. Alternatively, the substrate is dispersed in a water immiscible solvent or oil, or is evaporated from an organic solvent leaving a thin film. The stock solutions should be protected from light at all times due to the potential for photobleaching, common for fluorophores. The labeling solution is prepared by diluting an aliquot of the stock solution into an aqueous or partially aqueous buffer or into media or plasma to the desired labeling concentration. In one embodiment of the invention, two or more dyes of the invention are present in the labeling solution, having distinct spectral properties, which can be monitored simultaneously (providing multiplexed analysis).",
                        "In general the amount of substrate added in the labeling solution is the minimum amount required to yield detectable staining of the target organelles present in the sample within a reasonable time, with minimal background fluorescence or staining of other organelles or cellular structures. The amount of substrate required for staining eukaryotic cells depends on the sensitivity required for staining the intracellular organelles, the number of cells present, the permeability of the cell membrane to the substrate, and the time required for the probe to localize to the organelles and present a detectable signal. The required concentration for the labeling solution is determined by systematic variation in labeling concentration until a satisfactory fluorescent labeling is accomplished. Typically, the amount of substrate required for staining animal cells is 1 to 100 uM, preferably below 500 uM.",
                        "In addition, since the enzyme assays are kinetic in nature, the length of time used for staining can provide a method of adjusting differential staining parameters. Low concentrations of dye require longer incubation times for equivalent fluorescent brightness to be reached. Typically cells incubated in 10 uM labeling solution require about 1 hour to attain an arbitrary level of fluorescent staining that is reached in about 15 minutes using a 200 uM labeling solution. Monitoring the staining over these incubation times can be used to monitor kinetic parameters of the enzyme or enzymes being interrogated. For those embodiments where the organelles to be stained are present in plant cells, yeast or other fungal cells, a higher concentration of dye is typically used, due to the lower permeability of the plant, yeast or fungal cell membranes. Typically, when staining fungal cells, a dye concentration of 1 mM is satisfactory to give good staining results.",
                        "Staining concentrations less than about 100 \u03bcM give good staining of organelles in live animal cells. At higher concentrations of stain, background fluorescence increases in live cells, but resolution of acidic organelles after fixation is improved. Staining of isolated (cell-free) organelles typically requires lower concentrations of substrates.",
                        "The exact concentration of substrates to be used is dependent upon the experimental conditions and the desired results and optimization of experimental conditions is required to determine the best concentration of stain and duration of incubation to be used in a given application.",
                        "Sample Types",
                        "The sample optionally comprises cell-free isolated organelles or cells that contain the target organelles. Any cells that contain the desired organelles can be used, including but not limited to, fresh or cultured cells, cell lines, cells in biological fluids, cells in tissue or biopsy samples, yeast cells, fungal cells, plant cells and sperm cells. Where the sample contains cells, the cells are optionally abnormal cells, such as tumor cells or other cancer cells, where the abnormal cells are present in vitro or in vivo, or primary cells derived from patients with specific disease. Target organelles of interest that are stained using the present method of staining include, but are not limited to, the Endoplasmic Reticulum, the cis- and trans-Golgi Apparatus, Secretory Protein Trafficking Vesicles, tubulovesicular transport intermediates, intracellular membrane transport structures or the like. In one embodiment of the invention, the staining method is used to label multiple organelles in the same sample. Typically, the organelles that are stained are the ER and Golgi apparatus.",
                        "In addition, certain bacterial species including, but not limited to, Legionella pneumophila, Brucella, Cholera, Chlamydia or malarial infections, are known to sequester within individual organelles in living mammalian cells Celli J, Tsolis R M (2015) \u201cBacteria, the endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response: friends or foes?\u201d Nature Reviews Microbiology 13:71-82.1. The substrates of the present invention are also useful in detection of enzymes produced by these infecting bacteria and may also find utility in the analysis or diagnosis of bacterial or viral disease infecting living mammalian cells.",
                        "Staining the Sample",
                        "The sample is typically stained by passive means; that is the labeling solution is combined with the sample being analyzed and incubated for a length of time. The substrates of the present invention are introduced into the sample organelles by incubation of the sample in the labeling solution. Where the sample contains a cell or cells, the cells are similarly stained by incubation of the cell or cells in the labeling solution, typically while the cells are being grown under standard sterile culture conditions. Alternatively, the sample is stained by direct uptake of the substrate from a thin film of the substrate applied to a plate, microplate or cell well, or by adhering the substrate to a latex bead or polymer matrix that is introduced into the sample. Any other method of introducing the substrates into the sample cell, such as microinjection of a labeling solution, can be used to accelerate introduction of the substrates into the cellular cytoplasm. Typically the substrates will be introduced into the sample cell by incubation in the labeling solution, or by microinjection. Preferably the substrate is introduced to the sample by incubation in the labeling solution for a fixed period of time. Microinjection of substrate solution is used when labeling of the organelles within a single cell is desired, within a colony of other complex arrangement of sample cells.",
                        "A number of reagents and conditions are known to affect the uptake of the substrates into the target organelles, and therefore affect the staining by the substrates of the invention, including but not limited to nutrients (for example carbohydrates such as glucose), surfactants and selected drugs that are also included herein by example.",
                        "The substrates of the present invention are generally non-toxic to the living cells and organelles being labeled. Sample cells have been incubated in a 200 uM substrate solution for 24 hours without observable changes in morphology, viability or other harmful effects. Stained cells have been observed to undergo normal cell division, producing daughter cells that also possess stained organelles.",
                        "Preparation for Observation",
                        "Optionally, the cells or isolated organelles are washed to improve the results of the staining procedure. Washing the sample cell or cells after incubation in the labeling solution, or optionally after fixation or permeabilization, can greatly improve the visualization of the stained organelles. This is largely due to the decrease in non-specific background fluorescence after washing. Satisfactory visualization of organelles is possible without washing by using low labeling concentrations (for example <10 uM).",
                        "The sample can be observed immediately after staining of the organelles becomes evident. After staining, the cells or isolated organelles in a sample are optionally fixed with common reagents known in the art. Selected embodiments of the substrates described above are well retained in cells, and sample cells stained with these substrates retain considerable fluorescent staining after fixation. A number of fixatives and fixation conditions are suitable for practicing this invention. Useful fixatives include, but are not limited to, formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, formalin, glutaraldehyde, cold methanol and 3:1 methanol acetic acid. Typically, cell fixation is accomplished by incubating the stained cells in a 3.7% solution of paraformaldehyde for about 15-30 minutes. Fixation is typically used to preserve cellular morphology and to reduce biohazards when working with pathogenic samples.",
                        "Fixation is optionally followed or accompanied by permeabilization, such as with acetone, ethanol, DMSO or various detergents. Permeabilization is utilized to allow bulky additional detection reagents such as labeled antibodies to enter the cellular space that would ordinarily be impermeant to an intact cellular membrane. A large variety of fixatives, fixation conditions, and permeabilization agents are known in the art, and other methods of fixing or permeabilizing sample cells in conjunction with the stains of the present invention will be obvious to one of ordinary skill.",
                        "The use of antifade mountants for increased signal intensity and minimized photobleaching or imaging buffers formulated to lower background fluorescence, maintain proper pH and osmolarity during long duration staining at 37\u00b0, provide an energy source and preserve fluorescent signals are compatable with staining using the substrates of the present invention and can be incorporated into staining protocols without affecting results.",
                        "Additional Detection Reagents",
                        "The use of the organelle stains of the present invention is optionally combined with the use of an additional detection reagent. An additional detection reagent is a reagent that produces a detectable response due to the presence of a specific cell component, intracellular substance, or cellular condition. One or more additional detection reagents may be used in conjunction with the stains of the present invention, before or after fixation and/or permeabilization. The additional detection reagent may be used to stain the entire cell, or a cellular substructure. The fluorescent signal of the organelle stains of the present invention and the detectable response of the additional detection reagent may be observed simultaneously or sequentially. The observation of organellar staining and a detectable response that are spatially coincident indicate that the additional detection reagent is associated with the target organelles. A variety of measurements can be made within organelles in this manner, even when the additional detection reagent does not itself localize selectively within the target organelles.",
                        "One class of appropriate additional detection reagents are fluorescent nucleic acid stains. A wide variety of appropriate nucleic acid stains are known in the art, including but not limited to, Thiazole Orange, ethidium homodimer, propidium iodide, Hoechst 33342, and DAPI. Additional useful nucleic acid stains are described in WO 93/06482; U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,134; U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,130; U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,030; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,437,980. The use of an appropriate nucleic acid stain in conjunction with the dyes of the present invention can be selected to allow simultaneous observation of the target organelles in conjunction with nuclear DNA, cellular RNA and/or mitochondrial DNA. Of particular utility is an additional detection reagent that is a cell-permeant nucleic acid stain, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,134, allowing simultaneous visualization of acidic organelles and the cell nucleus. Use of these additional nucleic acid stains in conjunction with the organelle stains of the present invention provide a direct means of counting the number of cells present in a specific sample, since there is typically only one nucleus per cell. In this manner the number of stained organelles per cell can also be calculated as well as the relative intensity of the organelles per individual cell or between different cell types. This data can be used to indicate the level of enzyme activity per cell or between different individual cells.",
                        "Other appropriate additional detection reagents include selected fluorescent metal ion indicators described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,517 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,975.",
                        "In another embodiment of the invention, an appropriate additional detection reagent is any probe that selectively stains a cellular organelle such as the cell membrane, nucleus, lysosome, and mitochondrion or is a second organelle probe for the same organelle or for the ER or Golgi apparatus.",
                        "Specific examples of additional detection reagents include mitochondria-targeted stains, such as Rhodamine 123. Additional fluorescent stains specific for mitochondria are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,268. The above mitochondral stains accumulate in mitochondria, and are fixable therein, allowing simultaneous visualization of both mitochondria and the ER or Golgi organelles in fixed and permeabilized cells. Additional lysosomal stains are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,460,862.",
                        "In one embodiment, the additional detection reagent comprises: a) one member of a specific binding pair or a series of specific binding pairs, and b) a means for producing a detectable response. A specific binding pair member can be a ligand or a receptor. As used in this document, the term ligand means any organic compound for which a receptor naturally exists or can be prepared. A receptor is any compound or composition capable or recognizing a spatial or polar organization of a molecule, e.g. epitopic or determinant site. Ligands for which naturally occurring receptors exist include natural and synthetic peptides and proteins, including avidin and streptavidin, antibodies, enzymes, and hormones; nucleotides and natural or synthetic oligonucleotides; lipids; polysaccharides and carbohydrates; lectins; and a variety of drugs, including therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse and pesticides. Ligands and receptors are complementary members of a specific binding pair, each specific binding pair member having an area on the surface or in a cavity which specifically binds to and is complementary with a particular spatial and polar organization of the other.",
                        "The additional detection reagent may be used in conjunction with enzyme conjugates to localize cellular receptors; to localize hybridization probes; or to probe cells and tissues that do not express the enzyme, for example, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or enzyme-mediated histochemistry or cytochemistry, or other enzyme-mediated techniques. Enzyme-mediated techniques take advantage of the attraction between specific binding pairs to detect a variety of analytes. In one embodiment, the additional detection reaction comprises an enzyme substrate to produces a fluorescent precipitate in the presence of the appropriate enzyme, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,316,906 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,986.",
                        "In general, an enzyme-mediated technique uses an enzyme attached to one member of a specific binding pair or series of specific binding pairs as a reagent to detect the complementary member of the pair or series of pairs. In the simplest case, only the members of one specific binding pair are used. One member of the specific binding pair is the analyte, i.e. the substance of analytical interest. An enzyme is attached to the other (complementary) member of the pair, forming a \u201ccomplementary conjugate\u201d. Alternatively, multiple specific binding pairs may be sequentially linked to the analyte, the complementary conjugate, or to both, resulting in a series of specific binding pairs interposed between the analyte and the detectable enzyme of the complementary conjugate incorporated in the specific binding complex.",
                        "The additional detection reagent also incorporates a means for producing a detectable response. A detectable response means a change in, or occurrence of, a parameter in a test system which is capable of being perceived, either by direct observation or instrumentally, and which is a function of the presence of a specifically targeted member of a specific binding pair in a cell sample. Such detectable responses include the change in, or appearance of, color, fluorescence, reflectance, pH, chemiluminescence, infrared emission, or the deposition of an electron-rich substrate. Appropriate labels to provide a detectable response include, but are not limited to, a visible or fluorescent dye, an enzyme substrate which produces a visible or fluorescent precipitate upon enzyme action (for example, the action of horseradish peroxidase upon diaminobenzidine), visible or fluorescent labeled latex microparticles, or a signal that is released by the action of light upon the reagent (e.g. a caged fluorophore that is activated by photolysis, or the action of light upon diaminobenzidine).",
                        "Observation",
                        "At any time after or during staining, the sample is illuminated with a wavelength of light that results in a detectable fluorescence response, and subsequently observed with a means for detecting the detectable response of fluorescent labeled organelles, if present. In one embodiment of the invention, the fluorescently labeled organelles are observed after the cell or cells have additionally been fixed and/or permeabilized. Observation is accomplished using visible light microscopy, or alternatively, observation of the sample comprises illuminating the stained sample with a wavelength of light appropriate to generate a fluorescent response, and visually examining the sample by use of a microscope, or confocal microscope.",
                        "The sample is optionally illuminated at a wavelength of ultraviolet, visible or infrared light specific for optimal excitation of the fluorophore dye present in the sample after enzyme action to remove the BLOCK group. Where the sample contains more than one BLOCK, or contains an additional detection reagent, illumination occurs at a wavelength that generates a detectable fluorescence response in each fluorescent dye or additional detection reagent, where said dyes and detection reagents possess overlapping excitation maxima.",
                        "Typically, the dyes of the invention typically possess a strong absorbance at visible wavelengths, typically at greater than 450 nm, preferably at greater than 500 nm, yet more preferably at greater than 600 nm. The preferred dyes of the invention exhibit an extinction coefficient greater than 10,000/cm M, preferably at greater than 30,000/cm M. The fluorophores of the invention typically possess quantum yields of fluorescence emission that are greater than 0.3, preferably greater than 0.7.",
                        "Optionally, the sample is observed using instrumentation. For example, where the sample contains a cell or cells, observation of the sample is accomplished by illuminating the stained cell or cells with a wavelength of light appropriate to generate a fluorescent response, and electronically detecting and optionally quantifying the fluorescent emission of the stained organelles using an appropriate instrument, such as a fluorescence microscope, a digital camera, a fluorimeter, a fluorescent microplate reader, or a flow cytometer. These instruments routinely contain specific filters to reduce incident or extraneous light wavelengths but allow the emitted light to be interrogated.",
                        "The observation of the fluorescent response of the sample optionally includes selecting or sorting the stained organelles in cells based upon their fluorescent response. Typically the sample comprises cells having stained organelles, and the cells of the sample are sorted based upon the overall staining of the individual cells. The step of sorting is typically accomplished using a flow Cytometer, fluorescence activated cell sorter or a suitably equipped fluorescence microscope.",
                        "Photodynamic Therapy",
                        "The use of simple fluorescent dyes as sensitizing agents to enhance photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,189,029 and 5,446,157. Photodynamic therapy refers to the process wherein illumination is utilized to destroy cells, typically abnormal cells, that have previously been labeled with a dye. Several references, including Geze, et al. (Photochem. Photobiol. 20, 23-35 (1993); and Berg et al. (Int. J. Cancer 59, 814-822 (1994) have previously indicated that the photolysis of dyes that are localized to lysosomes destroys tumor cells. Furthermore, the lysosomes of tumor cells are generally considered to have a lower pH than normal lysosomes. Selective uptake of PDT dyes into tumor cells in preference to normal cells is an important property allows selective photodestruction of abnormal cells in the course of PDT treatment, while minimizing the destruction of normal cells.",
                        "The method of the current invention has utility for photodynamic therapy, as described above, as the greater activity of enzymes in the organelles of tumor cells will result in greater uptake of the targeted substrates into tumor cells. Photolysis of the stained cells will then result in destruction of the target tumor cells without affecting neighboring normal cells and tissues. Although cells and tissues stained according to the present method are potential PDT targets, preferably the long wavelength fluorescent dyes used for PDT targeting of cells are those that absorb beyond 600 nm, more preferably those that absorb beyond 650 nm, due to the enhanced penetration of light through tissues at these wavelengths. Particularly preferred are the dyes of the invention having fused aromatic substituents that are further substituted by a LINK-T moiety. Additional preferred dyes of the invention for PDT are those having bromine or iodine substituents such as eosin and erythrosine.",
                        "Preferred dye concentrations for labeling cells for PDT are those concentrations that have been determined to produce the greatest selective uptake of dye into abnormal cells without detriment to normal cells, such that photolytic activity is maintained in the abnormal cells. As described above, micromolar concentrations of dye are effective in staining specific organelles of live cells. The dyes are applied to cells for PDT by means well understood in the art, including local or systemic injection, topical application, incorporation into liposomes or other means. Dye uptake into cells is by passive diffusion or receptor-mediated uptake. Selective accumulation in the ER or Golgi is facilitated by the process of retrograde transport. Photolysis is performed with any excitation source that is capable of producing light that can be absorbed by the dye, including lasers and light sources that produce near-infrared or infrared irradiation. This light may be delivered either directly to the cells that contain the dye, or delivered indirectly such as through an optical fiber. Fluorescence properties of the dye can be used to guide and determine which cells are to be irradiated.",
                        "As described herein, targeted substrates of the present invention may be used with high-throughput screening systems to quickly and accurately assess the effect of gene regulation or secondary drug application on organelle (Golgi, peroxisome, nulear or ER) enzyme function. No prior attempt has been made to utilize the described combination of enzyme substrate targeting to the specific organelles such as the Golgi or ER with specific organelle enzyme activity detection in living cells.",
                        "The instant systems are useful for specific medical applications. In particular, the targeted substrates shown to be effective for monitoring enzymes in live cells representing disease can be used in existing high content drug screening systems, for the analysis of physiological conditions known to influence organelle (Golgi, ER, etc.) enzymes and for the identification and validation of treatment modalities that are either existing or under development. In addition, use of the instant reagents and methods and allied protocols in combination with other detection modalities in vivo, will provide tools for general analysis by the pharmaceutical and general biology research communities for use in monitoring new systems, especially in neurodegenerative diseases research. The resulting tools will have wide applications for the analysis of and selection for cell types or cells with various levels of enzyme activity by methods such as Flow Cytometry and Fluorescence Activated Cell sorting (FACS). Finally, the instant reagents and methods will find application to the diagnosis of disease.",
                        "The therapeutic options for treating many of the diseases affecting the ER and Golgi are relatively limited; in fact, there are currently no available therapies for many of these disorders. The problem is further compounded by difficulties in delivering therapeutic agents to the central nervous system, which is where the pathology is frequently manifested and monitoring the effectiveness of treatment regimens is problematic. To date, therapeutic efforts have mainly focused on strategies for augmenting enzyme concentrations to compensate for the underlying defect. These strategies include allogenic bone-marrow transplantation, enzyme-replacement therapy, substrate deprivation, gene therapy or progenitor cell infusion. The instant sensitive and specific assays for monitoring organelle enzyme activities in living cells will be of significant value in monitoring the success of current therapies and for discovery of new therapeutic strategies for diseases of specific organelle origin.",
                        "The organelle stains and substrates of this invention are further designed to allow free permeation through the plasma and organelle membranes of intact cells and can be used for staining cells at very low concentrations necessary for high-content screening and analysis. Further, they are non-toxic to living cells or tissues. The instant dyes, substrates and methods are also useful for investigating the biogenesis of organelles, the development of autophagic vacuoles, secretory mechanisms, investigating retina and cultured neurons, monitoring changes in organelle enzyme activities, evaluating the relative levels of enzymes in both normal and diseased states and detecting pH or ion gradients within the targeted organelles. The current invention is also useful for labeling specific phenotypic cell types that possess these organelles, including mammalian, bacterial, yeast, spermatozoa and plant cells, and may provide new methods of characterizing infectious or invasive species.",
                        "Among the enzymes that are present in these organelles and that can be detected using the substrates of the present invention are those listed in Table 11 (Golgi Enzymes) and Table 12 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Enzymes) below given as a descriptive embodiment of the present invention but not intended to be a complete list of possible enzyme activities which may be detected using the substrates and methods of the present invention.
