    "title": "Fluorogenic Substrates for Visualizing Acidic Organelle Enzyme Activities",
    "date": "2016-05-26",
    "abstract": "Lysosomes are acidic cytoplasmic organelles that are present in all nucleated mammalian cells and are involved in a variety of cellular processes including repair of the plasma membrane, defense against pathogens, cholesterol homeostasis, bone remodeling, metabolism, apoptosis and cell signaling. Defects in lysosomal enzyme activity have been associated with a variety of neurological diseases including Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Lysosomal Storage Diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Fluorogenic lysosomal staining probes were synthesized for labeling lysosomes and other acidic organelles in a live-cell format and were shown to be capable of monitoring lysosomal metabolic activity. The new targeted substrates were prepared from fluorescent dyes having a low pKa value for optimum fluorescence at the lower physiological pH found in lysosomes. They were modified to contain targeting groups to direct their accumulation in lysosomes as well as enzyme-cleavable functions for monitoring specific enzyme activities using a live-cell staining format. Application to the staining of cells derived from blood and skin samples of patients with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Krabbe and Gaucher Diseases as well as healthy human fibroblast and leukocyte control cells exhibited localization to the lysosome when compared with known lysosomal stain LysoTracker\u00ae Red DND-99 as well as with anti-LAMP1 Antibody staining. When cell metabolism was inhibited with chloroquine, staining with an esterase substrate was reduced, demonstrating that the substrates can be used to measure cell metabolism. When applied to diseased cells, the intensity of staining was reflective of lysosomal enzyme levels found in diseased cells. Substrates specific to the enzyme deficiencies in Gaucher or Krabbe disease patient cell lines exhibited reduced staining compared to that in non-diseased cells. The new lysosome-targeted fluorogenic substrates should be useful for research, diagnostics and monitoring the effect of secondary therapeutic agents on lysosomal enzyme activity in drug development for the lysosomal storage disorders and allied diseases.",

                "Lysosomes are acidic cytoplasmic organelles that are present in all nucleated mammalian cells. Lysosomes have been found to be involved in a variety of cellular processes including repair of the plasma membrane, defense against pathogens, cholesterol homeostasis, bone remodeling, metabolism, apoptosis and cell signaling. To date, more than 50 acidic hydrolytic enzymes have been identified that are involved in ordered lysosomal degradation of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Functional deficiencies in these lysosomal enzymes are indicative of a number of disease states. Lysosomes are also involved in metabolism and catabolism of foreign molecules that are brought into the cell by endocytosis, acting as a first line of defense against foreign bacterial or viral infection. The acidic pH of lysosomes is critical to the process by which lipid-enveloped viruses enter the cytoplasm after their cellular uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Acidic organelles have also been shown to be responsible for digestion of high molecular weight proteins, oligosaccharides, glycolipids or peptides by the cell. In addition, they are often involved in therapeutic drug metabolism.",
                "The lysosomal storage diseases are a family of genetic human metabolic diseases that, in their severest forms, cause mortality due to a variety of conditions such as progressive neurodegeneration, organ failure or cardiac arrest. They are caused by mutations in the genes encoding lysosomal glycohydrolases that catabolize glycosphingolipids within the lysosome, activator proteins or integral membrane proteins. When there is a lysosomal enzyme deficiency, the deficient enzyme's undegraded substrates gradually accumulate within the lysosomes causing a progressive increase in the size and number of these organelles within the cell. This accumulation within the cell eventually leads to malfunction of the organ and to the symptoms of a lysosomal storage disease, with these symptoms depending on the particular enzyme deficiency. More than fifty distinct, inherited lysosomal storage diseases have been characterized in humans.",
                "Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease in humans, is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (hGCB; GBA1; glucosylceramidase; acid \u03b2-glucosidase; EC 3.2.1.45). This deficiency leads to an accumulation of the enzyme's substrate, glucocerebroside in cells and tissues, leading to anemia, bone deterioration, and in the case of type II and III seizures and brain damage. Recent developments have also indicated a probable link between Gaucher disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease where both carriers of a GBA1 mutation and disease sufferers show earlier onset and more severe symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. Krabbe disease (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare, often fatal degenerative lysosomal disorder that causes storage of unmetabolized lipids that affect growth of the nerve's protective myelin sheath. It is caused by a deficiency in galactosylceramidase (GALC; ED 3.2.1.46). New, sensitive and specific assays for monitoring such lysosomal enzyme activities in living cells will be of significant value in monitoring the success of current therapies and for discovery of new therapeutic strategies for diseases of lysosomal origin.",
                "Weakly basic amines have been shown to selectively accumulate in cellular compartments with low internal pH. When further linked to chromophores or fluorescent probes, they can be used to label these compartments. Among these is the frequently used acidotropic probe, N-(3-((2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino)propyl)-N-(3-aminopropyl)methylamine, dihydrochloride (referred to as DAMP). DAMP is not fluorescent and requires fixation and permeabilization of the cell, followed by the use of anti-DNP antibodies conjugated to a fluorophore, an enzyme or ferritin in order to visualize the staining pattern. The fluorescent probes neutral red and acridine orange are also commonly used for staining acidic organelles. In addition, fluorescently labeled latex beads and macromolecules, such as FITC-dextran, have been used to label lysosomes or record lysosomal pH, but they lack specificity and are not well retained in the organelles, particularly after fixing and permeabilization. Dansyl cadaverine has been described as a lysosomotropic reagent [1,2]. But recent reports also describe it as a useful label for autophagic vacuoles, as it fails to label either endosomal compartments or lysosomes [3]. Perfluorobenzylamides and chloromethyl derivatives of fluorophores have also been utilized for monitoring lysosomal metabolism in live cells, but their staining patterns are often non-specific. Finally, certain dipyrrometheneboron difluoride (BODIPY) fluorophores linked to a weak base that is only partially protonated at neutral pH have been used for general labeling of lysosomes [4]. However as none of these probes have shown utility for monitoring specific enzyme activities within lysosomes, they are not useful for analysis of enzyme defects resulting in pathogenic conditions or of the effect of secondary drug administration on lysosomal enzyme activities in live cells.",
                "Of the numerous lysosomal storage assay diagnostic systems that have been reported, the majority utilize either fluorescent (4-methylumbelliferyl) substrates, chromogenic (nitrophenolic glycosides), glycolipids labeled with fluorescent dyes or radioactive substrates for detection of lysosomal glycosidase activities. These methods, however, utilize either cell lysate from cells or tissue homogenates, HPLC or TLC separation of enzymatic products and UV or fluorescent analysis or other complex analysis techniques that are not transferable to a live cell format. None of these assays, therefore, are well designed for live-cell high-content systems detection, and require either cell lysis or extensive cell preparation steps. In addition, the fluorescent dyes used in these assays are often not amenable to the low pH environment of the lysosome and therefore do not permit imaging in the lysosome in its native environment.",
                "We herein describe a series of fluorogenic enzyme substrates (Fig 1) derived from fluorophores with low pKa values that show utility for labeling and tracing enzyme activity within acidic organelles, and in particular in lysosomes, within living cells. These new probes contain weakly basic amine targeting groups that allow them to selectively accumulate in acidic organelles with low internal pH and show promise for use in investigating the specific enzyme levels responsible for biosynthesis, degradation and recycling of cellular components and for measuring specific enzyme defects involved in a number of human diseases associated with abnormal enzyme activity in lysosomes within live cells."

Captured images were then quantified using Cell Profiler (Broad Institute, Boston MA). Objects in the blue and green channels were identified using Global Otsu Two-Class thresholding method and the intensity of the pixels contained within those objects measured for the green channel and the number of objects measured for the blue channel. The average green intensity per cell was calculated for each image and the average per cell over all images calculated."

As seen (Figs 2 and 3) both the LAMP1 antibody staining patterns and the LysoTracker\u00ae Red DND-99 staining distribution were found to co-localize with the esterase substrates (5) and (6), exhibiting a high degree of co-localization in all cases. LysoTracker\u00ae Red DND-99 exhibited some additional staining in other acidic vesicles, most likely early phagocytic, autophagosome and endosome vesicles, as is documented in the literature [6,7]. The esterase substrates presumably exhibit somewhat more specific staining patterns as their distribution is linked to enzymatic activity present in lysosomal or mature fused lysosomal organelles rather than merely due to pH partitioning. Similar, albeit less defined colocalization was observed with the other lysosomal stains, such as acridine orange and neutral red (data not shown)."

First, chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent typically found as its diphosphate salt (pKa 8.5) was examined as a general inhibitor of lysosomal enzyme activity. The unprotonated form of chloroquine rapidly diffuses across cell and organelle membranes where it preferentially accumulates in lysosomes. Once in the lower pH environment of the lysosome (pH 4.6) chloroquine becomes protonated and unable to diffuse again across the lysosomal membrane [8], acting to raise the intralysosomal pH [9]. This accumulation has also been shown to lead to general inhibition of lysosomal enzymes [10], as well as preventing fusion of endosomes and lysosomes. Interestingly, treatment with chloroquine has also been shown to result in the increased number and size of lysosomes as well as autophagosomes as monitored by LysoTracker\u00ae staining [6] most likely due to buildup of unprocessed substrates in the lysosomes.",
                        "Since the targeted lysosomal substrates only become fluorescent upon enzymatic activity, treatment of cells with chloroquine should act to inhibit enzymatic activity and reduce staining. Fig 4 illustrates staining patterns after treatment with chloroquine where combined application of the esterase substrate (5) exhibited significantly reduced staining in lysosomes despite increased lysosomal size. This data indicates the esterase substrate is not simply staining lysosomes, as with LysoTracker\u00ae dyes, but is useful in monitoring changes in intracellular enzyme activity upon inhibition.",

CBE has been widely used to inhibit the lysosomal glucosylceramide-degrading enzyme (glucocerebrosidase, GBA) in live cells and has even been used as a method of mimicking certain genetic metabolic disorders such as Gaucher disease [11, 12]. As seen in Fig 5, treatment of healthy donor fibroblast cells with CBE at different concentrations exhibited a dose-response change in staining using the lysosomal targeted \u03b2-glucosidase substrate (4) indicating that this targeted glucosidase substrate is capable of monitoring lysosomal \u03b2-glucosidase enzyme activity and measuring residual levels of enzyme activity after inhibition. Residual activity at higher concentrations may be attributed to background detection during cell profiler analysis as no staining is visible in the images prior to analysis, it has also been reported that after similar 16 hour incubation periods there is still some residual GCase activity [13]."

Staining with the peracetylated versions of the substrates, compounds (2) and (4), provided specific, punctate staining patterns in live cell format, as is shown in Fig 6. Ubiquitous intracellular esterase activity in the lysosome is presumably able to remove the acetate permeabilizing groups releasing the free sugar which is then available for measurement of desired glycosidase activity in the cell. Although the enzyme reaction kinetics are somewhat slower using these peracetate versions of the substrates, careful monitoring of time versus staining intensities can be used to provide effective quantitative data of relative enzyme activity."

Fixation can also trap the cells at a specific state of differentiation or growth and is therefore particularly useful in high-throughput screening applications. Fluorescent probes that can withstand standard fixing and permeabilization conditions are therefore of added utility. Since the LysoTracker\u00ae probes have been shown to be amenable to fixation conditions [15], the ability of the targeted lysosomal substrates to withstand fixation (4% formaldehyde/1% glutaraldehyde in PBS) and permeabilization (0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS) conditions was examined. Fig 7 shows a triple labeling experiment wherein the cell lysosomes were labeled with (5) for 1.5 hours and then fixed and co-stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) to label the nuclei as well as TAMRA-SE (red) to label cell membranes. Staining of the lysosomes remained robust even after the fixation and permeabilization conditions of this method. Similar fixing and permeabilization prior to staining with primary and secondary antibodies (see Fig 2) were also found to be amenable to the substrate staining procedure. The preferred method was to label for the lysosomal enzymes prior to fixing, since the fixation conditions may affect enzyme activities."

Measurement of lysosomal \u03b2-glucosidase enzyme activity in Gaucher I cells is diagnostic of the disease and is usually performed by cell lysis techniques using analysis with MUG (4-methylumbelliferyl \u03b2-D-glucopyranoside). The MUG assay is performed at low pH with added sodium taurocholate to provide specificity for the lysosomal glucosidase (GCase) levels. Staining data obtained by incubating Gaucher I cells with the targeted \u03b2-glucosidase substrate (4) followed by image analysis using the CellProfiler program [16] with data obtained by standard MUG assay [17] as well as with data obtained from staining with (4) and analysis by flow cytometry (Fig 8), demonstrated that the levels of staining using the new lysosomal targeted substrate were in good correlation with those obtained using the other two methods, supporting the hypothesis that the targeted substrates measure enzyme levels in the lysosome.

                "We have developed a series of targeted lysosomal enzyme substrates based upon fluorophores with low pKa values for optimum fluorescence in the low pH environment found in the lysosome. In addition, these fluorogenic substrates contain a weakly basic targeting group, similar to that used with other lysosomal stains such as the LysoTracker\u00ae dyes, that acts to sequester their localization to this organelle. Finally, these substrates contain an enzyme cleavable group that is specific for the enzyme being examined. Further permeabilizing groups on these substrates were found to help with cell loading as well as localization to the target organelle.",
                "The addition of the enzyme cleavable group renders these fluorogenic substrates either non-fluorescent, in the case of fluorescein-based substrates, or weakly fluorescent (with shifted emission) in the case of the resorufin-based substrates. This property makes them ideal for quantitative measurement of activity and potentially even kinetic analysis of defective or mutant enzyme reaction rates inside living cells. Since these new substrates can be produced from multiple fluorophores, each with well separated excitation and emission spectral properties, the promise of multiplexed analysis of several enzyme activities simultaneously within the same cells becomes feasible. Because individual genetic mutations do not always directly correspond to disease progression, these methods hold the promise of measuring lysosomal enzyme activity to study the effect of a mutation or the relationship between enzyme activity and disease progression between several patient samples, in real time, and potentially relating this data to more precise treatment regimens.",
                "We were surprised to find that, for measurement of glycosidase activities, use of the native sugars for conjugation in the substrates (e.g. (1) and (3)) was found to result in limited staining, even after overnight incubation. Additional permeabilization techniques were required. It is known in the literature that acetate-protected sugar moieties can more easily pass across the cell membrane [19], where they accumulate inside the cell and are deblocked by the action of ubiquitous intracellular esterases. Using this method, we were able to increase staining for the glycosidase substrates by use of peracetate protected glycosidase substrates. In addition, peracetate substrates were found to be more stable in cell culture conditions and even seemed to show greater organelle specificity. Excellent staining with (5) and (6) indicated that there was abundant esterase activity in the lysosomes, even in disease cell lines.",
                "An interesting question surfaced concerning trafficking of the substrates in the cell and the order of activity. Since there are known to be additional glycosidase or esterase activities outside of the lysosome, it is of interest to evaluate whether the targeted substrates are partitioned to the lysosome prior to enzymatic release of the fluorophores, or whether enzyme activities in the cytosol or other organelles can produce the targeted dyes which are then partitioned to the lysosome.",
                "Three lines of support seem to point to the former mechanism, namely that the intact substrates are quickly partitioned first to the target organelle where the enzyme activity of interest releases their fluorescent signal. First, our attempts to stain cells, even at very high concentrations, with the base targeted dyes (7) and (11) resulted in essentially no staining. Apparently, due to the positive charge of the targeting group, these base dyes are not very permeant to the cell membrane. Secondly, time lapse photomicroscopy (S1 Fig) of the staining patterns observed for these substrates exhibited steadily increasing fluorescence staining specifically in the lysosomes, with virtually no cytosolic or other organelle staining. Finally, the correlation of the staining levels to those obtained by independent techniques measuring lysosomal enzyme activities, indicate that the substrates appear to be predominantly measuring the enzyme activity in the target organelle and not cell-wide activities.",
                "A microplate based assay system was developed to utilize intact, living cell lines and provide an accurate analysis of enzyme activity for high content screening. Originally our intention was to use adherent cells for analysis, since they would be amenable to washing and staining protocols. However in order to obtain an appropriate number of cells for analysis in a timely and effective manner we chose to instead use immortalized B-Lymphoblast cells [20] for our primary analysis and restrict use to fibroblasts to those analyses requiring detailed imaging.",
                "Because the leukocytes are much smaller than fibroblasts, it was necessary to place many more cells in each well in order to get acceptable signal intensities over noise; and as they are non-adherent there was a need for a no-wash, simple additive assay. Washing steps requiring removal of supernatant media often led to loss of cells. Also, since leukocytes are known to clump in culture, we utilized several declumping techniques including physical re-pipetting of culture solutions to remove more dense clumps as well as addition of Accutase. In order to count the cells in situ as well as determine cytotoxicity, a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae assay was employed. Finally, we observed that some few leukocytes in each well routinely exhibited very high staining levels, which we attributed to possible ongoing cell division where those cells exhibited increased number, size and enzyme activity in their lysosomes. We found that they were more amenable to growth in large numbers in smaller volume flasks, presumably due to release of certain growth co-factors at higher density. CellProfiler analysis, however, was made more difficult because of the small cell size and clumping properties of the leukocytes.",
                "The use of leukocytes, however, was advantageous in flow cytometry, since the cells are small and do not need preparation (trypsinization, etc.) prior to analysis. In addition, the cytometric data obtained was routinely considered to be more accurate than microplate results, since dead or dying cells were channel separated by co-staining with DRAQ7\u2122, a membrane impermeant far-red nucleus staining fluorescent dye. And since the data is averaged based on staining of individual cells, plate reader artifacts can be reduced. The effects of other cell states, such as apoptotic, necrotic, cells undergoing replication or antibody staining for specific cell types could also be sorted or co-analyzed. Flow cytometric analysis may potentially offer the most accurate prospect for use of these substrates for diagnostic analysis of disease progression or even response to treatment methodologies.",
                "CellProfiler image analysis (Broad Institute) of the cells after staining was routinely employed as a method of final assessment of enzyme activity (Fig 12). However, setting up the pipelines for this method involved determining certain parameters that could change in each experiment. In order to validate the data, three image sets were first analyzed manually to ensure that primary object identification, or segmentation, of the nuclei was occurring accurately. The pipeline had to be adjusted for the variation of staining intensity or microscope light intensities used in each experiment, and was addressed by adding illumination correction modules in the pipeline. The images rendered from the illumination correction were then used to allow the segmentation of objects of interest. Data was interpreted as a percentage of the healthy cells\u2019 staining intensity on a per cell basis, using Hoechst nuclear staining to quantify cell number (nuclei) and the bright-field image to select the outer edge of each cell. The cell edges were identified by first transforming the bright-field image into a binary image, which separated the foreground from the background. The nuclei were identified using the global maximum correlation thresholding (MCT) method and clumped objects were distinguished with a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) transformation.",
                "The same illumination correction and threshold parameters placed upon the nuclear images were applied to the images containing the staining of interest to segment the punctate staining and isolate it from the background. After identifying the staining regions of interest, the objects\u2019 intensities were measured within the confines of the identified regions, but using the original images. Fibroblasts and leukocytes required slightly different pipelines because of the differences in the size of their nuclei and general cell shape. Once a pipeline was developed, it was used for analysis of all cells in that experiment in order to ensure accurate correlation."

                "Intracellular enzyme activities are known to be involved in numerous metabolic activities as well as being implicated in various disease states. Defects in lysosomal enzymes have been associated with a number of genetic diseases. These include mutations within the GBA1 gene encoding acid beta-glucosidase involved in Gaucher Disease as well as deficiency of lysosomal \u03b2-galactosidase in Krabbe disease. Recent evidence has also implicated a link between the levels of glucocerebrosidase activity (GCase) and disease progression in other diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease. But methods to determine intracellular enzyme activities using a live cell format for diagnosis or for drug discovery are limited by often involved and complex cell preparation methods or are based upon selective inhibition, indirect or special analysis techniques. These often preclude their use in high-content or high-throughput analysis methods. We have developed a series of targeted enzyme substrates that can be used in a live cell format to measure lysosomal enzyme activities. We believe the use of the new lysosomal targeted substrates in a live-cell, HCS/HTS platform could be a valuable tool in the search for new therapeutics, not only for Gaucher I and Krabbe diseases, but also other metabolic diseases involving lysosomal enzymes."
