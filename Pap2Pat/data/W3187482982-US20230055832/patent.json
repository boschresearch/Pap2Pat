                        "The ability to comprehensively profile proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules in intact tissue in situ is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, neuroscience, and stem cell biology. The differences between individual cells in complex biological systems may have significant consequences in the function and health of the entire systems. The precise location of multiple, varied biomolecules in a tissue or cell is critical for understanding the spatial organization, gene expression regulation, and interactions of diverse cell types in complex multicellular organisms. However, most of the existing methods for in situ analysis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules can only quantify a small number of different molecules in a biological sample. Conventional protein imaging methodologies such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) only allow a handful of proteins to be detected in one tissue sample, and the methods may miss transcripts present at low copy numbers. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for highly sensitive and multiplexed approaches to in situ protein and nucleic acids analysis."

As described herein, this development provides for in situ analysis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules in intact tissues with single-molecule sensitivity.",

In certain embodiments, a detectable label such as a fluorophore is tethered to tyramide via a cleavable linker. Preferably, the cleavable linker is a chemically cleavable linker. As described herein, to enable signal removal (e.g., fluorescent signal) after protein staining the cleavable detectably labeled tyramide preferably comprises a fluorophore tethered to tyramide through a chemically cleavable linker. An important aspect of the technology of this disclosure is efficient cleavage of the detectable label in a cellular environment while maintaining protein antigenicity. Additionally, it is preferred that the linker is small enough to permit recognition of CLT by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and to avoid compromised diffusion of a short-lived tyramide radical. In some embodiments, the cleavable linker comprises the structure of Formula III, wherein R comprises a detectable marker and T comprises tyramide:",

Further examples of suitable linkers and cleavage mechanisms are described by Milton et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 7,414,116) and by Leriche et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2012, 20:571-582), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

                        "In another aspect, provided herein is a method for multiplexed in situ analysis of biomolecules in a tissue. As used herein, the term \u201cmultiplexed\u201d refers to the detection of multiple signals (e.g., two or more signals), such as, for example, analytes, fluorescent signals, analog or digital signals, that are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The term encompasses the detection of multiple signals simultaneously in a single sample or single reaction vessel, as well as the combining of images of multiple signals to obtain one image that reflects the combination.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1A, the method comprises three steps in each analysis cycle. First, for analysis of a protein in a tissue, the tissue is contacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody configured to bind specifically to the protein target. For analysis of nucleic acids in a tissue, the tissue is contacted with a HRP-conjugated oligonucleotide probe configured to hybridize to the nucleic acid target. In some embodiments, the HRP-conjugated targeting agent is configured to bind directly to the target biomolecule of interest. In some embodiments, the HRP-conjugated targeting agent binds to an intermediate, e.g., binds to a primary antibody or a primary oligonucleotide that binds directly to or hybridizes directly to the target biomolecule.",
                        "The tissue is also contacted with a detectably-labeled, cleavable tyramide. HRP catalyzes the coupling reaction between the cleavable tyramide and tyrosine residues on an endogenous protein target in close proximity. In the second step, fluorescence images are captured to generate quantitative protein expression profiles. Finally, detectable labels attached to the cleavable tyramide are chemically cleaved in step that simultaneously deactivates HRP, which allows for initiation of the next analysis cycle. Through reiterative cycles of target staining, fluorescence imaging, fluorophore cleavage, and HRP deactivation, a large number of different target biomolecules with a wide range of expression levels can be quantified in single cells of intact tissues in situ.",
                        "In exemplary embodiments, the method comprises (a) contacting the tissue with a plurality of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated targeting agents that are configured to specifically bind or hybridize to the target biomolecule in the contacted tissue, wherein the second contacting step occurs under conditions that promote binding or hybridization of the targeting agents to the target biomolecule; (b) contacting the tissue with the cleavable detectably-labeled tyramide (CLT) compound of Formula I, under conditions that promote conjugation of the cleavable labeled tyramide to the target biomolecule; (c) imaging the tissue thereby detecting the detectable marker; (d) contacting the tissue sample with a composition comprising 1,3,5-Triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at about 40\u00b0 C. for about 30 minutes; and (e) repeating steps (a)-(d), as necessary, depending on the number of biomarkers to be detected.",
                        "The targeting agent will vary depending on the type of target biomolecule. In some cases, the target biomolecule is a protein or peptide. In such cases, the targeting agent will be an antibody that specifically binds to the target protein or peptide. For example, if the target biomolecule is protein Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), the target agents comprise anti-HDAC2 antibodies conjugated to HRP. Antibodies suitable for the methods include, without limitation, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof. HRP-conjugated antibodies can be used to detect other target biomolecules such as lipids and metabolites.",
                        "In other cases, the target biomolecule is a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RNA). In such cases, the targeting agent will be a HRP-conjugated oligonucleotide having sequence complementary to the target nucleic acid sequence. Under appropriate conditions, the HRP-oligonucleotide will hybridize to the target nucleic acid sequence. In some cases, multiple cycles of the method are performed to detect multiple target biomolecules using targeting agents that are HRP-conjugated antibodies, HRP-conjugated oligonucleotides, or a combination thereof.",
                        "In some cases, the target biomolecule is a carbohydrate. In such cases, the targeting agent can be a HRP-conjugated lectin that is capable of binding carbohydrate. As used herein, the term \u201clectin\u201d refers to a protein or glycoprotein that binds to specific carbohydrate structures to form a lectin-carbohydrate complex. The term encompasses lectins derived from animal and plant sources, and which bind carbohydrates by affinity. The term \u201clectin\u201d as used herein also encompasses glycoproteins and proteins not normally termed lectins but which immunologically bind carbohydrates, such as antibodies, e.g., monoclonal antibodies. Since lectins bind selectively to some but not all carbohydrates (e.g., monosaccharides, such as mannose, GleNAc, gelatose, a-fructose or sialic acid) to different degrees, it will be understood that the type of lectin conjugated to HRP will vary depending on the target carbohydrate of interest.",
                        "Any appropriate method of preparing antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugates can be used. Exemplary protocols for preparation of an HRP antibody conjugate are known in the art. By way of non-limiting example, HRP can be activated for conjugation by treatment with a 100-fold molar excess of a bifunctional PEG linker having a maleimide group and an active ester group. Antibodies to a protein of interest can be prepared for conjugation by introducing thiols using, for example, DTT. A thiolated antibody can be contacted to a molar excess of HRP comprising a bifunctional PEG linker for conjugation.",
                        "Likewise, methods of preparing an oligonucleotide probe conjugated to HRP are well known in the art and can be commercially obtained.",
                        "In some cases, the HRP-conjugated detection agent (e.g., antibody, oligonucleotide) and cleavable detectably labeled tyramide are contacted in the presence of a tyramide signal amplification buffer. In some cases, the amplification buffer comprises an aqueous phosphate-buffered, borate-buffered, or other buffered solution to which low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are added. In some cases, the amplification buffer comprises 0.0015% H2O2 and 0.1% triton X-100 in 0.1 M boric acid, pH=8.5. Commercial tyramide signal amplification buffers are available from several manufacturers including, for example, PerkinElmer, ThermoFisher, and Biotium.",
                        "In some embodiments, the signal from the detectable marker is removed in a \u201cremoving step.\u201d In some embodiments, the removing step comprises chemically cleaving the detectable label. Any appropriate means of removing a detectable signal or detectable label (e.g., a fluorophore) can be used according to the methods provided herein. Methods of removal can include without limitation one or more of photobleaching, chemical deactivation, chemical cleavage of the fluorophores (see the Examples below), enzymatic cleavage of the fluorophores, DNA/RNA strand displacement, chemical or heat denaturing of an intermediate fluorescent oligonucleotide, and the like. Since photobleaching can be a time-consuming step, in some cases the methods provided herein comprise efficiently removing fluorescence signals by chemical deactivation or chemical or enzymatic cleavage of detectable labels.",
                        "In some cases, the methods provided herein comprise chemical inactivation of fluorophores. For example, fluorophores can be inactivated by oxidation. Protocols for oxidation of dyes with hydrogen peroxide, which can be catalyzed using either acidic or basic conditions, or reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to those practitioners in the art for changing the fluorescent properties of dyes and fluorescent proteins.",
                        "In some embodiments, the detectable marker is removed by chemical cleavage of the linker joining the tyramide and the detectable marker. In some embodiments, the linker is cleaved by contacting the sample with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and 1,3,5-Triaza phosphaadamantane (PTA), either as separate components or as a composition. In some embodiments, the contacted sample is incubated at a temperature of about 30\u00b0 C., 31\u00b0 C., 32\u00b0 C., 33\u00b0 C., 34\u00b0 C., 35\u00b0 C., 36\u00b0 C., 37\u00b0 C., 38\u00b0 C., 39\u00b0 C., 40\u00b0 C., 41\u00b0 C., 42\u00b0 C., 43\u00b0 C., 44\u00b0 C., 45\u00b0 C., 46\u00b0 C., 47\u00b0 C., 48\u00b0 C., 49\u00b0 C. or about 50\u00b0 C. The time of incubation is about 10 to about 120 minutes, 20 to about 90 minutes, 30 to about 60 minutes, or about 30 minutes. In some embodiments, the sample is washed prior to the next cycle.",
                        "When fluorescently labeled tyramide is used, fluorescence photomicroscopy can be used to detect and record the results of consecutive in situ analysis using routine methods known in the art. Alternatively, digital (computer implemented) fluorescence microscopy with image-processing capability may be used. Two well-known systems for imaging FISH of chromosomes having multiple colored labels bound thereto include multiplex-FISH (M-FISH) and spectral karyotyping (SKY). See Schrock et al.

                        "To minimize issues of autofluorescence or background signal, oligonucleotide targeting agents can be designed to hybridize to a target nucleic acid at multiple places on the target nucleic acid sequence. Thus, an increased number of oligonucleotides will hybridize to each target nucleic acid sequence (e.g., transcript) to enhance signal to noise ratio. As used herein, the terms \u201cbinding,\u201d \u201cto bind,\u201d \u201cbinds,\u201d \u201cbound,\u201d or any derivation thereof refers to any stable, rather than transient, chemical bond between two or more molecules, including, but not limited to, covalent bonding, ionic bonding, and hydrogen bonding. The term \u201cbinding\u201d encompasses interactions between polypeptides, for example, an antibody and its epitope on a target protein. The term also encompasses interactions between a nucleic acid molecule and another entity such as a nucleic acid or probe element. Specifically, binding, in certain embodiments, includes the hybridization of nucleic acids. In some cases, the methods further comprise a blocking step to reduce background signal. The term \u201cblocking\u201d as used herein refers to treatment of a sample with a composition that prevents the non-specific binding of the target substance to the sample. Typically a blocking composition comprises a protein, such as casein or albumin, and may additionally comprise surfactants. The function of the blocking protein is to bind to the sample to prevent the non-specific binding of assay reagents.",

The term \u201cstripping\u201d encompasses using heat, a buffer, denaturing agent, detergent, temperature condition, pH condition, osmolarity agent, or any combination thereof. Non-limiting examples of stripping include boiling a sample or subjecting a sample to a boiling solution, subjecting a sample to a very low pH (e.g. pH 2) or high pH (e.g. pH 10), and/or subjecting a sample to a denaturing agent or detergent, such as, e.g., subjecting a sample to SDS, a glycine buffer, glycine SDS, and/or boiling a sample in citrate buffer. Heat-induced stripping may optionally be accomplished by microwaving a sample or subjecting a sample to solution which has recently been microwaved or otherwise brought to its boiling point. For example, heat-induced stripping encompasses subjecting a sample to a 100\u00b0 C. condition for at least about 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or greater. Stripping may optionally be accomplished using a combination of heat-induced stripping and another agent or condition, such as, e.g., a buffer, pH condition, osmolarity agent, detergent, denaturing agent, or any combination thereof.

                                "Abstract: Understanding the composition, function and regulation of complex cellular systems require tools that quantify the expression of multiple proteins at their native cellular context. Here, we report a highly sensitive and accurate protein in situ profiling approach using off-the-shelf antibodies and cleavable fluorescent tyramide (CFT). In each cycle of this method, protein targets are stained with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibodies and CFT. Subsequently, the fluorophores are efficiently cleaved by mild chemical reagents, which simultaneously deactivate HRP. Through reiterative cycles of protein staining, fluorescence imaging, fluorophore cleavage, and HRP deactivation, multiplexed protein quantification in single cells in situ can be achieved. We designed and synthesized the high-performance CFT, and demonstrated that over 95% of the staining signals can be erased by mild chemical reagents while preserving the integrity of the epitopes on protein targets. Applying this method, we explored the protein expression heterogeneity and correlation in a group of genetically identical cells. With the high signal removal efficiency, this approach also enables us to accurately profile proteins in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues in the order of low to high and also high to low expression levels.",
                                "Introduction: Highly multiplexed protein profiling in their native spatial contexts holds great promise to reveal the composition, regulation and interaction of the various cell types in complex cellular systems [1,2]. Protein microarray [3] and mass spectrometry [4] are well-established methods for proteomic analysis. However, as these approaches do not quantify proteins in their original cellular environment, the location information of the proteins are lost during analysis. Immunofluorescence is a powerful tool for in situ protein quantification. Nonetheless, due to the spectral overlap of the common fluorophores, immunofluorescence only allows a small number of varied proteins to be profiled on each specimen [5].",
                                "To allow multiplexed in situ protein analysis, several techniques [6-14] have been explored. In these approaches, the fluorophores or metal isotopes directly conjugated antibodies are applied as detections tags. Without further signal amplification, these approaches suffer from low detection sensitivity, which limits their applications for analysis of low expression proteins or studying highly autofluorescent specimen, such as formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues [7]. Recently, some signal amplification methods have been developed for multiplexed protein imaging [15,16]. However, these approaches require a chemical or oligonucleotide tag to be conjugated to primary antibodies. To prepare those tag conjugated primary antibodies can be time-consuming and expensive. More importantly, the bulky chemical or oligonucleotide tag can interfere with the binding affinity and specificity of the primary antibodies.",
                                "To enable highly sensitive and multiplexed protein imaging with off-the-shelf antibodies, our group developed a reiterative protein staining approach using cleavable fluorescent tyramide (CFT) [17]. We demonstrated its sensitivity is improved by about two orders of magnitude compared with other existing methods. As a result, its imaging time is dramatically reduced, and the sample throughput is significantly enhanced. However, some non-ideal factors still exist. For example, the carbamate group in the first-generation CFT could potentially react with the nucleophiles in the cellular environment or during storage, which may lead to side reactions or short shelf life. Additionally, with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) as the signal removal reagent, the first-generation CFT requires 65\u00b0 C. to remove \u02dc95% of the staining signals. Nevertheless, this relatively high reaction temperature could damage the integrity of the epitopes [17].",
                                "Here, we report a highly sensitive and multiplexed in situ protein analysis method using high-performance CFT. In this approach, protein targets are recognized by antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and then stained with CFT. Without the carbamate group in this newly designed CFT, it avoids the potential side reactions with the cellular nucleophiles. Additionally, over 95% the staining signals can be efficiently removed using 1,3,5-Triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA) and TCEP at 40\u00b0 C. And simultaneously, HRP is also effectively deactivated under this mild condition. Through reiterative cycles of target staining, fluorescence imaging, signal erasing and HRP quenching, we demonstrated at least 10 reiterative immunofluorescence cycles can be successfully carried out in cultured cells. With the generated multiplexed single-cell in situ protein profiling data, we explored the protein expression heterogeneity and correlation in a population of genetically identical cells. We also showed the significantly improved signal removal efficiency of our approach enables the accurate quantification of multiple proteins in the order of low to high and also high to low expression levels in FFPE tissues.",

First, the protein of interest is recognized by over-the-shelf antibodies labeled with HRP, which catalyzes the coupling reaction between the tyramide in CFT and the tyrosine residues on the proteins proximal to the antibodies. Second, the specimen is imaged under a fluorescence microscope to generate quantitative single-cell in situ protein expression profiles. In the last step, the fluorophores tethered to tyramide are efficiently removed by chemical cleavage, and HRP is simultaneously deactivated. With continuous cycles of staining, imaging, cleavage and HRP deactivation, highly multiplexed and sensitive protein profiling can be achieved in single cells in situ.",

Additionally, the linker tethering the fluorophore and tyramide must be cleaved efficiently under a mild condition by a bioorthogonal reaction. Our group recently has developed cleavable fluorescent oligonucleotide for comprehensive RNA and DNA in situ profiling [18]. The azide-based linker used in that method satisfies the two requirements for successful CFT. Therefore, that linker is applied to couple the fluorophore to tyramide in high performance CFT. Most tissues exhibit stronger autofluorescence in the green and yellow emission channels than in the red channel [19]. Thus, to minimize the impact of autofluorescence on the accurate protein analysis, we applied Cy5 as the fluorophore in CFT under the current study.",

                                "One consideration for the success of the multiplexed protein imaging approach is to efficiently remove the staining signals without loss of protein antigeneity. In this way, the signal leftover generated in the previous cycles can be minimized, and other protein targets can still be successfully recognized by antibodies in the following immunofluorescence cycles. To assess the fluorophore cleavage efficiency of the high-performance CFT, we stained protein ILF3 in a human tonsil FFPE tissue (FIG. 2A). To facilitate the efficient signal removal in different microenvironment, we applied the positively charged phosphine PTA in combination with the negatively charged phosphine TCEP to perform fluorophore cleavage. After incubating with PTA and TCEP at 40\u00b0 C. for 30 min, over 95% of the signals were removed (FIG. 2B, C). Compared with the first-generation CFT, the reaction temperature of 65\u00b0 C. is required to achieve the similar cleavage efficiency. However, that high cleavage temperature leads to the partial loss of protein antigenicity. The results here suggest that the fluorophore in the high-performance CFT can be very efficiently removed under a relatively low cleavage temperature.",
                                "We next investigated whether the epitope integrity is preserved under this cleavage condition. Previously, we have shown that the TCEP treatment at this relatively low temperature does not result in loss of protein antigenicity [8]. Thus, here we evaluated the effects of the PTA incubation on the epitope integrity (FIG. 3). After the PTA treatment overnight, protein ILF3 was stained in a human tonsil FFPE tissue. The generated staining patterns (FIG. 3A, B) and signal intensities (FIG. 3C) are consistent with the ones obtained without the PTA treatment. These results indicate that the antibody antigenicity is maintained under our mild fluorophore cleavage condition.",

In this way, the HRP applied in the previous cycles will not produce false positive signals in the following cycles. To evaluate whether PTA and TCEP can cleavage the fluorophore and deactivate HRP simultaneously, we stained HMGB1, HDAC2, TAP43, PABPN1, hnRNP A1, Nucleolin, H4K16ac, hnRNP K, ILF3 and Nucleophosmin with HRP labeled antibodies and the high-performance tyramide-N3-Cy5 in HeLa cells (FIG. 4). All the antibodies used in this study are well validated and documented in the literature [20-29]. With the PTA and TCEP treatment, over 95% of the staining signals were erased, leading to the on/off ratio of about 20:1. After signal removal, we stained the cells again with tyramide-N3-Cy5. No signal increases were observed for all the 10 proteins. These results confirm that PTA and TCEP can efficiently cleave the fluorophores in the high-performance CFT, and also suggest that HRP are almost completely deactivated simultaneously.",

As controls, we also stained each of those 10 target proteins using the conventional tyramide signal amplification (TSA) approach (FIG. 5B). The protein distribution patterns generated by the two approaches, together with the ones obtained with antibodies from varied clones [30,31], closely resemble each other. Additionally, the mean protein expression levels per cell obtained using our and TSA methods are also consistent (FIG. 6A). Comparison of the results measured by the two approaches generates an R2=0.99 with a slope of 1.09 (FIG. 6B).

To study such protein expression heterogeneity in individual HeLa cells, we quantified the distribution of the protein abundances in single cells (FIG. 7A). The expression levels of all the 10 analyzed proteins are distributed widely, which leads to the relatively large expression standard deviations in FIG. 6. And the square of those expression standard deviations is significantly higher than the average expression levels for each measured protein. These results suggest that the protein expression in individual HeLa cells is highly heterogeneous, which may be attributed to the synthesis of those proteins in bursts [39].",

Such studies carried out in populations of cells usually require external stimuli to induce different protein expression levels in varied cell groups. With the gene expression heterogeneity naturally generated in individual cells, single-cell protein expression covariation analysis can advance our understanding of regulatory pathways and predict the potential function of unannotated proteins [40]. To perform such studies, we calculated the pairwise expression correlation coefficient of the 10 analyzed proteins. Some protein pairs exhibit high expression correlation with the correlation efficient of \u02dc0.8, including HDAC2 and PABPN together with PABPN and hnRNP A1. To elucidate the regulatory network among the 10 analyzed proteins, a hierarchical clustering method [41] was used and identified a group of 8 proteins with substantial expression correlation (FIG. 7B). As reported in the literature [42-49], those 8 proteins are indeed involved in the transcription processing and regulation pathways.",

We also stained these three proteins by the conventional TSA method (FIG. 8B). The staining patterns and signal intensities obtained by the two approaches are consistent with each other (FIG. 8D). These results indicate that multiplexed in situ protein profiling can be achieved in FFPE tissues using the high-performance CFT.",
                                "The existing reiterative protein staining approaches [7-12] require the proteins to be profiled in the order of increasing abundances, so that the leftover signals produced in the previous cycles may not interfere with the protein quantification in the following cycles. However, sometimes the amount of the precious clinical and biological samples is limited, and thus it can be impossible to have the knowledge of the relative protein expression levels in advance. Additionally, the order of the protein abundances in the varied cell types and states in the same specimen can be different. As a result, it might not be feasible to have an ideal protein analysis sequence that works for all the distinct cell types in the same specimen. Due to its high signal removal efficiency, our CFT approach may partially address those issues by eliminating the requirement of knowing the relative protein abundances in advance. To assess whether proteins can be profiled in the order of decreasing expression levels, we stained protein hnRNP K, Nucleophosmin and ILF3 sequentially on a human FFPE tonsil tissue (FIG. 8C). The generated staining patterns and signal intensities of all the three proteins closely resemble the ones obtained by the conventional TSA approach (FIG. 8D). These results suggest that the high signal removal efficiency of our approach enables it to partially eliminate the requirement of the prior knowledge of protein abundances and potentially allow accurate protein quantification regardless of the protein profiling order.",

                                "In summary, we have design and synthesized the high performance CFT, and demonstrated it can be applied for multiplexed in situ protein profiling in culture cells and FFPE tissues. Compared the existing multiplexed protein imaging technologies, our approach has the following advantages. First, with the signal amplification by HRP, our approach has dramatically improved detection sensitivity. As a result, it enables the precise quantification of low-expression proteins in highly autofluorescent specimen, and also significantly enhance the sample throughput by reducing the imaging time. Second, as the commercially available and well validated antibodies are directly used in our approach, the time-consuming and expensive antibody-tag conjugation process is avoided. Third, by eliminating the carbamate group in the chemical structure of the high-performance CFT, the potential side reactions during CFT storage and protein staining are minimized. Finally, with the enhanced signal removal efficiency under a mild condition, our approach could allow multiple proteins to be precisely quantified regardless of the protein analysis order.",
                                "The multiplexing capacity of our approach depends on the number of reiterative analysis cycles and the number of proteins profiled in each cycle. We have shown that the protein antigeneity is preserved after the PTA overnight incubation, and we also documented previously that the integrity of the epitopes is maintained following the TCEP treatment for 24 hours [8]. As each signal removal reaction only requires 30 minutes of the PTA and TCEP incubation, we envision that at least 20 to 30 reiterative cycles can be performed on the same sample. In each analysis cycle, after staining the different protein targets using CFT with varied fluorophores, the HRP can be deactivated [50] or the antibodies can be stripped [51] using the established methods. In this way, four or five different proteins can be quantified in each cycle. As a result, we anticipate that our approach has the potential to enable \u02dc100 proteins to be profiled in the same specimen.",
                                "The high-performance CFT developed here can also be applied for in situ analysis of nucleic acids [52] and metabolics [53]. By integrating these applications with protein analysis, the combined DNA, RNA, protein and metabolic analysis can be achieved in single cells in their natural spatial contexts. This highly multiplexed in situ molecular profiling platform will bring new insights into systems biology, biomedical research and precision medicine.",

This technology achieves the detection of large number of varied proteins including low expressing proteins and quantifying them in their native state through continuous cycles of target staining, fluorescence imaging, signal removal and antibody staining. This scores over other protein detection/quantitation tools where isolation of protein is required leading to loss of information about its localization.",

However, the existing multiplexed protein imaging technologies are limited by their detection sensitivity or technically demanding. To address these issues, here we develop an ultra-sensitive and multiplexed in situ protein profiling approach by reiterative staining with off-the-shelf antibodies and cleavable fluorescent tyramide (CFT). In each cycle of this approach, the protein targets are recognized by antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase, which catalyze the covalent deposition of CFT on or close to the protein targets. After imaging, the fluorophores are chemically cleaved and the antibodies are stripped. Through continuous cycles of staining, imaging, fluorophore cleavage and antibody stripping, a large number of proteins can be quantified in individual cells in situ. Applying this method, we analyzed 20 different proteins in each of \u02dc67,000 cells in a human formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tonsil tissue. Based on their unique protein expression profiles and microenvironment, these individual cells are partitioned into different cell clusters. We also explored the cell-cell interactions in the tissue by examining which specific cell clusters are selectively associating or avoiding each other.",
                                "Understanding the composition, interaction and regulations of complex biological systems require tools that quantify the abundances of multiple proteins in single cells in their native cellular context [1-3]. Mass spectrometry [4] and protein microarray [5] are powerful technologies for comprehensive protein analysis. Nonetheless, these approaches require proteins to be purified and isolated from other cellular components as sample preparation prior to its analysis. Consequently, the protein location information in the biological system is lost. Immunofluorescence is a well-established method for profiling proteins in situ. However, as a result of the spectral overlap of the common fluorophores [6], only a handful of different proteins can be visualized by immunofluorescence in one specimen.",
                                "To enable multiplexed protein imaging, a number of methods have been developed recently. In these techniques [7-16], fluorophores or metal isotopes conjugated primary antibodies are applied to stain the protein targets. Without signal amplification, the low detection sensitivity of these methods limits their applications to study low-expression proteins or to examine specimens with high autofluorescence, such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues [17]. To tackle these issues, several laboratories including ours have developed several sensitive and multiplexed protein imaging technologies by signal amplifications with biotin-streptavidin interaction [18], oligonucleotide hybridization [19], and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [20,21]. However, these methods require a chemical, oligonucleotide or HRP labeled primary antibodies to recognize the protein targets. Such conjugated primary antibodies are usually not commercially available, and to prepare those primary antibodies labeled with the desired tag can be technically demanding, time consuming and costly. Additionally, these bulky tags on the primary antibodies can interfere with their binding specificity and affinity, leading to false negative and positive staining signals.",
                                "Here, we report a highly sensitive and multiplexed in situ protein profiling approach using cleavable fluorescent tyramide (CFT) and off-the-shelf antibodies. In this approach, protein targets are stained with HRP conjugated antibodies and CFT. Following image capture, the staining signals are erased by fluorophore cleavage. And simultaneously, HRP are deactivated. After all the targets are stained in the first cycle, the antibodies are stripped to initiate the second cycle. Through reiterative cycles of target staining, fluorescence imaging, signal removal and antibody stripping, a large of varied proteins can be quantified in their native spatial contexts at the optical resolution. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we show that the microwaving-mediated stripping can efficiently remove the antibodies, and maintain the epitope integrity for at least 20 analysis cycles. Applying this approach, we quantified 20 different proteins in \u02dc67,000 individual cells in a human FFPE tonsil tissue. Based on their unique protein expression profiles and their neighbor cells, these single cells are partitioned into varied cell clusters. By mapping the cell clusters back to their original tissue locations, we observe that different subregions of the tissue are composed of cells from different clusters. We also studied the cell-cell interactions in the tonsil tissue by identifying the association and avoidance among the specific cell clusters.",

In comparison with the current multiplexed protein imaging technologies, our approach has ultrahigh detection sensitivity by the enzymatic signal amplification.

Second, one of protein targets is stained with primary or secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP, which catalyzes the coupling reactions between the tyramide moiety in CFT and the tyrosine residues on the proteins proximal to the target. Third, images of the specimen are captured under a fluorescence microscope to generate quantitative single-cell protein expression profiles. To facilitate the alignment of different protein staining images, the nucleus stained with DAPI are imaged together with the protein target. Fourth, the fluorophores are cleaved by a chemical reaction, and HRP is deactivated simultaneously. Fifth, steps two to four are repeated until every protein target in the first analysis cycle is quantified. Finally, all the antibodies are stripped to initiate the next cycle. Through reiterative cycles of protein staining, fluorescence imaging, fluorophore cleavage, HRP deactivation and antibody stripping, highly sensitive and multiplexed in situ protein profiling can be achieved in single cells of intact tissues.",
                                "Efficient Antibody Stripping while Preserving Epitope Integrity",
                                "One aspect to consider for the success of this method is to efficiently strip the antibodies, so that the antibodies applied in the previous cycles will not result in false positive signals in the following cycles. To assess the antibody stripping efficiency, we stained 20 different proteins in human FFPE tonsil tissues with HRP conjugated antibodies and CFT (FIG. 10). Subsequently, the fluorophores were cleaved using a mild chemical reaction with 1,3,5-Triaza phosphaadamantane (PTA) and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Following signal removal, almost all the staining signals are erased, confirming the high cleavage efficiency of the CFT as we reported before. We also documented that this chemical reaction does not damage the epitope integrity, which allows other proteins to be accurately profiled in the later cycles. Following fluorophore cleavage, the antibodies were removed by microwave-mediated stripping. Afterwards, the tissues were re-incubated with HRP conjugated antibodies and CFT. However, no signal increase was observed. These results indicate that the antibodies applied for protein staining can be efficiently removed by microwave-mediated stripping.",
                                "Another aspect to consider for this approach to succeed is that the epitope integrity must be maintained under this antibody stripping condition. In this way, the stripping process applied in the prior cycles will not interfere with the precise protein profiling in the later cycles. To evaluate the effects of antibody stripping on epitope integrity, we stained proteins hnRNP K, Nucleophosmin and Bcl2 in the same human FFPE tonsil tissue, after 10, 15 and 20 cycles of antibody stripping, respectively (FIG. 11A). As positive controls, we also stained the same three proteins in three FFPE tonsil tissues using the conventional tyramide signal amplification approach. The staining patterns and signal intensities (FIG. 11B) obtained by the two methods are consistent with each other. These results suggest that the epitope integrity is preserved after at least 20 cycles of antibody stripping.",

All the 20 proteins were successfully stained and unambiguously detected with the subcellular resolution. The obtained protein staining patterns are consistent with the ones generated by staining each protein in different tissues (FIG. 10). Due to its high detection sensitivity resulting from the HRP signal amplification, our approach allows the imaging time to be dramatically reduced while maintaining the analysis accuracy. By automatic whole slide scanning with the fluorescence microscope, to image this tissue (\u02dc2 mm\u00d74 mm) only takes less than 10 min. In comparison, the current mass spectrometry imaging methods require \u02dc64 h to image the tissue with the similar sizes. These results indicate that our approach enables highly sensitive and multiplexed in situ protein profiling in FFPE tissues with short assay time and high sample throughput.",

To achieve that, we calculated the expression levels of the 20 examined proteins in each of \u02dc67,000 cells identified in the tissue. Based on their unique protein expression patterns (FIG. 13A and FIG. 15), those individual cells were partitioned into 10 different cell clusters (FIG. 13B) using the software viSNE. We then mapped these 10 cell clusters back to their natural tissue locations (FIG. 13C and FIG. 16), and observed that the varied subregions of tonsil tissue are composed of cells from distinct clusters. For instance, cluster 7 is the major cell type in epithelium. The germinal centers mainly consist of clusters 8 and 10, while the lymph nodules are dominated by clusters 5, 6 and 9. And clusters 1 and 4 only appear in connective tissues. These results indicate that our approach enables the study of cell type classification and their spatial distribution in FFPE tissues.",

To achieve that, we defined the cell neighborhood as all the cells within the 20 \u03bcm distance of a central cell. For the \u02dc67,000 individual central cells in the human tonsil tissue, we counted the cell number from varied clusters in each of the cell neighborhoods. We then calculated the correlation coefficient of those cell numbers between each pair of the different cell clusters. When displayed in the heatmap, the metric revealed that some cell clusters are selectively associated with or avoiding each other. For example, a significant association was observed between cell clusters 2 and 3, 5 and 9, together with 8 and 10; while an avoidance of contact was revealed between cell clusters 1 and 3, 1 and 8, along with 1 and 10. Interestingly, we observed a consistently strong association between the cells from same cell cluster (FIG. 14A, diagonal), indicating that homotypic cell adhesion may play an important role to form the architecture of the human tonsil tissue.",
                                "Based on the cell number from the distinct clusters in their neighborhoods (FIG. 14B and FIG. 17), the single cells in the same cluster can be partitioned into subclusters (FIG. 14C and FIG. 17). By mapping these newly identified cell subclusters back to their native tissue locations, we observed the different subclusters from the same cell cluster are located at the varied subregions of the tonsil tissue (FIG. 17). For example, subcluster 10a mainly appears in the germinal centers; the majority of subcluster 10b is observed at the lymph nodules; while almost all the subcluster 10c is located in connective tissues (FIG. 14D). These results suggest that our approach allows the investigation of cell-cell contact and the cell type classification based on their microenvironment.",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "In this study, we have demonstrated that ultrasensitive and multiplexed in situ protein profiling can be successfully achieved in single cells of FFPE tissues using CFT and antibody stripping. In comparison with the current multiplexed protein imaging technologies, our approach has ultrahigh detection sensitivity by the enzymatic signal amplification. As a result, low expression proteins or the targets in highly autofluorescent tissues can be accurately quantified. In addition, by eliminating the requirement of the sophisticated chemical conjugation of the primary antibodies, the binding specificity and affinity of the antibodies are maintained. And by enabling the large number of the commercially available unconjugated primary antibodies to be directly applied in the assay, our approach can be easily adopted by the research laboratories and in clinical settings.",
                                "Applying this method, we have shown that the individual cells in the human tonsil tissue can be classified into different cell clusters based on their unique multiplexed protein expression profiles. And the varied subregions of the tonsil tissue consist of cells from different clusters. We also explored which cell clusters are associating or avoiding each other. Depending on the distinct cell clusters of their neighbor cells, the single cells in each cluster are further partitioned into varied subclusters. These results suggest that our approach allows the classification of cell types and subtypes based on their protein expression profiles and neighbor cells. These identified cell types and subtypes will bring new insights into cell heterogeneity studies, disease diagnosis, and patient stratification.",
                                "The multiplexing capacity of this protein imaging technology depends on the cycling number and the number of proteins interrogated in each analysis cycle. Here we demonstrated that the integrity of the protein epitopes is maintained after at least 20 times of protein stripping. Recently, we also reported that the PTA and TCEP treatment does not damage the epitopes. These results suggest more than 20 analysis cycles can be performed on one tissue sample. In each cycle, the protein targets can be stained with primary antibodies from different species or of varied immunoglobulin classes, hapten or HRP conjugated primary antibodies. With four or five CFT consisting of distinct fluorophores applied in each cycle, together with repeated protein staining and fluorophore cleavage, potentially up to 10 protein targets can be quantified in one analysis cycle. As a result, we envision that this multiplexed protein imaging method has the potential to profile hundreds of varied protein targets in the same specimen.",
                                "This in situ protein analysis method can also be combined with the nucleic acids and metabolic imaging technologies, to enable the integrated DNA, RNA, protein and metabolic profiling in single cells of intact tissues. Moreover, a program-controlled microfluidic system together with a standard fluorescence microscope can easily make an automatic tissue imaging platform. This highly multiplexed molecular imaging system will have wide applications in systems biology and biomedical studies."

Images were captured using a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera and C-FL DAPI HC HISN together with Chroma 49009 filters. Image data was processed with NIS-Elements Imaging software. The DAPI images in every cycle were used as coordination reference for aligning the images from different cycles. For the single-cell protein expression profiles, cells were segmented based on nuclear staining by DAPI using NIS-Elements Imaging software. The DAPI signals were expanded by 10 pixels for every cell to determine the regions of interest (ROIs). The signal intensity values within the ROIs of each cell were calculated using CellProfiler, and the resulting single-cell signal intensity profiles were converted into comma separated value (CSV) files. Then, these files were used for unsupervised clustering by CYT to generate ViSNE plots (https://www.c2b2.columbia.edu/danapeerlab/html/cyt.html). All pseudo-color images were generated with ImageJ. Cell neighborhoods were calculated by detecting and classifying the surrounding cells within 20 \u03bcm or less of each individual cell in the sample. The number of cells from the different clusters in each cell neighborhood were used for clustering by CYT to generate subcluster ViSNE plots."
