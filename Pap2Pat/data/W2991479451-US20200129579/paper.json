    "title": "The impact of particulate matter (PM2.5) on skin barrier revealed by transcriptome analysis: Focusing on cholesterol metabolism",
    "date": "2020-01-01",
    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that particulate matter (PM2.5), as a major air pollutant, imposes a certain degree of destruction and toxicity to the skin. It particularly impairs the structure and function of the epidermis. To study the impact of PM2.5 on the skin, transcriptome analysis was performed on PM2.5-exposed human primary keratinocytes. Functional annotation analysis demonstrates that PM2.5 significantly up-regulates cholesterol-metabolism-related genes. Via lipid extraction from PM2.5 treated three-dimensional epidermis tissue model (3D-ETM) and subsequent characterization via mass spectrometry, it was confirmed that PM2.5 significantly increases epidermal cholesterol levels in vitro. Conversely, the amount of squalene in 3D-ETM was significantly reduced by PM2.5. Interestingly, neither cholesterol nor squalene showed significant fluctuations in the green tea extract (GTE) treated epidermis tissue model under PM2.5 exposure. This study shows that PM2.5 may cause barrier disorders by increasing cholesterol synthesis, leading to transient accumulation of epidermal cholesterol and decrease of squalene. It was suggested that cholesterol and squalene, which are the key substances affecting skin barrier function, can be used as new biomarkers of skin damage induced by PM2.5. Moreover, it was demonstrated that GTE can reduce damage caused by PM2.5 exposure by not only anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms, but also by off-setting the disturbance to epidermal lipid homeostasis. This study demonstrates the strong potential of GTE as an active ingredient to be utilized in cosmetic products to effectively reduce the damage PM2.5 induces in skin.",

                "With the global industrialization, atmospheric pollutants have caused serious human health problems [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines identifies four major air pollutants, namely ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide [2]. Among all these substances, PM2.5 is a small particulate matter, the aerodynamic diameter of which is less than 2.5 \u03bcm. As a key component of air pollution, PM2.5 imposes threats to the cardiovascular system, respiratory system and skin [3]. PM2.5 has a comparatively large specific surface area which can adsorb chemical pollutants and metal ions. It has been reported that prolonged exposure to particulate matters in the air can activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to extrinsic skin aging, wrinkle formation and changes in pigmentation [4]. Furthermore, skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis are induced and exacerbated by atmospheric pollutants [5].",
                "The outer layer of the skin, also known as the stratum corneum (SC) is described as a \"brick and mortar\" structure. The \"brick\" refers to flattened, protein-enriched corneocytes, while the \"mortar\" refers to free fatty acids, ceramides, and cholesterol. The three lipid components are stacked in a highly ordered three-dimensional structure that \"glues\" the corneocytes together, forming a strong barrier [6]. The proper function of the skin barrier depends on the integrity of the SC, especially the composition of lipids in the SC. Di Nardo et al. found that the skin barrier was impaired in patients with atopic dermatitis, showing that ceramide levels in the SC were lowered, cholesterol increased, and the ceramide/cholesterol ratio reduced [7]. Although the lipid components have been studied as a measure of barrier integrity, little is known about the effect of air pollutants on the lipid composition in the SC. A number of clinical tests performed in 1999-2014 globally showed that residents living in areas with severe air pollution had high level of sebum oxidation and damaged SC [8][9][10]. Results from Mexico and Shanghai showed that people living in heavily polluted areas had higher sebum levels and a lower ratio of squalene/cholesterol, but no significant change in cholesterol levels [8,10].",
                "As the key building blocks of the epidermis, keratinocyte-based in vitro models have been utilized to obtain mechanistic understanding of skin damage caused by external activators. Jin et al. studied the proteases stimulated by sulfur mustard in a normal human epidermis keratinocyte model [11]. Khalil et al. developed an assay system which utilized MTS, neutral red cytotoxicity and lactate dehydrogenase of HaCaT cells to characterize the cellular damage caused by UVB [12]. Keratinocyte models have also been applied to elucidate the mechanism of skin damage caused by chemical allergens, which can penetrate the skin barrier and cause allergic contact dermatitis. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were identified as key pro-inflammatory biomarkers of induction of allergic contact dermatitis in keratinocytes [13,14]. Furthermore, oxidative stress was shown to be the initial step in keratinocyte activation and thus is critical in allergic contact dermatitis [15]. In a HaCaT cell model, Potratz et al. showed that in addition to impacting the wellknown cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) also alter the lipid metabolite profile [16]. In this study, the goal was to understand the impact of PM2.5 on skin barrier by the transcriptome analysis of PM2.5-treated primary human epidermal keratinocytes (pHEK). Transcriptome analysis guided the focus to the changes in the expression of genes related to cholesterol metabolism. Then the impact of PM2.5 on cholesterol level was verified in a PM2.5 treated three-dimensional epidermis tissue model (3D-ETM).",
                "Furthermore, the intervention of PM2.5-induced-skin damage by a plant-derived active ingredient was explored. Camellia sinensis is a traditional, economic plant and can be processed by different degrees of fermentation. Green tea is produced from fresh C. sinensis leaves which are carefully dried, to avoid the oxidation and polymerization of phenols. One of the major polyphenols found in green tea is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is a monomeric flavanol with strong antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects. Studies have shown that green tea extracts can reduce UV-induced skin edema, erythema and protect DNA from UV-induced damage [17]. In this study, the effects of a green  tea extract rich in polyphenols were tested at transcriptomic level as an intervention to the damage of PM2.5 to skin, and the changes of key lipid biomarkers in the 3D-ETM were verified by LC-MS."

PM2.5 from March to April 2009 at Xi'an High-tech Zone was collected at an airflow rate of 1200 L/ min. The fine particles were trapped by a quartz fiber filter that was retrieved daily. Then the filter was sonicated in 40 mL of Milli-Q water for 15 min and repeated 3 times. After that, the suspension was dried using a vacuum freezer and stored at 4\u2103. Prior to cell treatment, PM2.5 was re-suspended in cell culture medium and sonicated for 30 min. Finally, the suspension was filtered with a glass fiber filter to remove the debris, making a final solution at 50 \u03bcg/mL of PM2.5. Methods of the chemical analysis of specific components have been reported previously in the literature [18]. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) was used to determine the elemental composition of 12 elements (i.e., S, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Br, Mo, Pb).

PM2.5 from Xi'an contains complex components such as metal ions, organic and inorganic substances. Several studies focus on the analysis of their chemical constituents [19] and the adverse effects on human health [20]. Elemental composition analysis (Table 1) shows that S, Zn, and Fe are the top three components of the PM2.5 used in the experiment. Zn and Fe are among the most abundant crustal elements, indicating that dust emission is an important source of this sample. Meanwhile, high concentration of S, NO 3",

Furthermore, it has been reported that OC/EC of coal combustion emissions is 2.5-10.5 [21]. In this experiment, OC/EC is 5.25, which again shows the major contribution of coal combustion emission. Hence, these results suggest that the PM2.5 sample is originated from coal-combustion and crustal dust."

In addition, the mRNA of S100A8, S100A9, TNFAIP3, IL-1a, and IL-1b, which are closely related to inflammation, were also significantly increased consistent with previous  reports [24]. It was further verified that PM2.5 can induce a significant inflammatory response in keratinocytes. Moreover, CYP1A1, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, was highly up-regulated. CYP1A1 is responsible for the metabolism of toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produced by the combustion of tobacco [25].

A clear map of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway can be found in the article published by Mazein et al. [29]. The cholesterol synthesis process is divided into three phases. First, acetyl-CoA forms mevalonate; secondly, two mevalonic acids are condensed into one isoprene, followed by the formation of squalene; and third, squalene is converted into cholesterol. The whole cholesterol synthesis process involves at least 23 genes. Both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis begin with a common precursor, acetyl-CoA, which is derived from the catabolism of sugars, proteins, and lipids. Among the genes induced by PM2.5 (Table 3), ACLY, ACSS2 is involved in the production of acetyl-CoA. HMGCS1, HMGCR participate in the first stage of cholesterol synthesis. MVD, FDFT1 participate in the second stage of cholesterol synthesis [29]. LSS, and SQLE participate in the synthesis of lanosterol by squalene in the third stage of cholesterol synthesis. LDLR encodes the protein receptor that binds to the carriers of cholesterollow density lipoproteins (LDLs). Hence, it is key for the uptake of cholesterol into cells. As a result, it is deduced that the up-regulation of these genes under the treatment of PM2.5 may lead to increased cholesterol synthesis."

Furthermore, results demonstrate that GTE acts mainly by counterbalancing the influence of PM2.5 on keratinocytes.",
                        "Similarly, Metascape was used to analyze the significantly down- regulated genes for the PM2.5 and GTE co-treated group in comparison with the group with PM2.5 treatment only (P < 0.001) (Fig. 6). In addition, the differentially expressed genes is listed in Supporting Information Table S\u2161.",
                        "The results showed that the Cytokine Signaling in Immune system (R-HSA-1280215) and wound healing (GO:0042060), which are closely related to the inflammatory response, were the most enriched terms that were down-regulated after GTE treatment. In addition, there are four other terms involved in the inflammatory response, namely: cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0019221), Interleukin-4 and 13 signaling (R-HSA-6785807), response to extracellular stimulus (GO:0009991). Therefore, it can be inferred that GTE primarily relieves PM2.5-induced inflammatory responses. In addition, the GO term: response to hydrogen peroxide (GO:0042542) indicating that GTE also acts an antioxidant, which relieves the oxidative stress induced by PM2.5. Regarding the synthetic pathway of cholesterol, although it is not shown in GO analysis, green tea extract significantly down-regulates the expression of HMGCS1 and LDLR genes (Supporting Information Table S\u2161), which are involved in cholesterol metabolism. The transcriptome analysis showed that the protective effect of GTE on cells may also be reflected in the restoration of the balance of cholesterol metabolism."

                        "Transcriptomic studies suggest that PM2.5 could disturb cholesterol homeostasis. To verify whether the final cholesterol level in the skin has changed, 3D in vitro skin model was treated with PM2.5 or co-treated with GTE + PM2.5. The cholesterol and squalene levels were characterized at different treatment times at Day 2, 4 and 6. Result are shown in Fig. 7. Under the treatment of PM2.5, cholesterol levels were much higher than that of the control group (Fig. 7A). The increase of cholesterol in the skin was the most significant on Day 2, which was about 2.5 times more as compared to the control group. Then the cholesterol level gradually decreased over day 4 to day 6. In contrast, squalene, which is a precursor of cholesterol, was significantly reduced after treatment of PM2.5. This suggests that more squalene is used for the synthesis of cholesterol under PM2.5 stimulation. Addition of GTE inhibits the increase of cholesterol induced by PM2.5, leading to equal levels of cholesterol as compared to the control group (Fig. 7B)."

                "In this study, the PM2.5 sample, which originates from coal combustion and crustal dust, is shown to up-regulate inflammatory, oxidative-stress-response, and AhR pathways in human primary keratinocytes. More importantly, gene cluster analysis reveals that besides the above-mentioned biological processes, PM2.5 significantly up-regulates many genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, such as ACLY\u3001ACSS\u3001 HMGCS1\u3001HMGCR\u3001MVD\u3001FDFT1\u3001SQLE\u3001LSS\u3001LDLR, etc. Most of these genes encode enzymes that play important roles in various stages of acetyl-CoA de novo synthesis of cholesterol. LDLR mainly participates in the transfer of cholesterol, mediating the endocytosis of cholesterol-rich LDL to absorb and utilize lipoprotein-carrying cholesterol [30]. It is further confirmed that the actual cholesterol levels in 3D skin model is significantly increased under the influence of PM2.5.",
                "It has been reported that the cholesterol level is an important indicator of the skin barrier function: in the epidermis of atopic dermatitis patients, the cholesterol level is significantly higher than that in healthy subjects [7]. Previous studies have also shown that HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are significantly increased at the transcriptional and translational levels under both acute barrier destruction caused by acetone or tape stripping and chronic barrier destruction caused by fatty acid deficiency [31]. It is suggested that barrier disruption induces lipid synthesis and intercellular trafficking to promote barrier repair. In this study, the transcription of HMG-CoA reductase in keratinocytes was up-regulated after PM2.5 treatment, and the cholesterol content in the 3D skin model increased significantly on the second day of PM2.5 treatment, then gradually decreased on day 4 and day 6. Since cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes, when damage occurs, the skin accelerates the rate of cell proliferation producing more keratinocytes to compensate for lesion sites [32]. This may explain why the cholesterol level gradually decreases on day 4, 6 as compared to day 2 after PM2.5 treatment. In summary, PM2.5 could lead to up-regulation of cholesterol synthesis, disrupting cholesterol homeostasis. Under PM2.5 exposure, a large amount of cholesterol is synthesized to supplement keratinocytes, intercellular lipids and repair the damaged SC.",
                "A compensatory increase in cholesterol level may further affect skin physiology. Cholesterol is also an important component of sebum. Study has shown that an increase in sebum has a negative effect on the epidermal barrier [33]. Moreover, the accumulation of cholesterol can cause the up-regulation of inflammatory responses, mainly by triggering the downstream signaling pathway of IL-1 [34].",
                "Another important question addressed in this study is the effect of green tea extract in preventing the damage caused by PM2.5. Although EGCG from green tea is known for its significant antioxidant effect [35], the specific effect of EGCG or green tea extract against the particulate matters has not been explored. Our experiment showed that when the appropriate concentration of green tea extract was added to PM2.5treated keratinocytes, many genes up-regulated by PM2.5 returned to normal level. The gene cluster analysis indicates that the related genes were mainly concentrated in the inflammatory response and oxidativestress pathway. In terms of cholesterol-metabolism-related genes, green tea extract significantly down-regulated the expression of HMGCS1 and LDLR genes. Finally, it was demonstrated that the addition of green tea to PM2.5-exposed skin tissue could significantly reduce the cholesterol level in 3D skin model."

Moreover, the data demonstrates that green tea extract (GTE) effectively inhibits the damage induced by PM2.5, including reversing PM2.5 stimulated cholesterol synthesis. This suggests that GTE has protective effects on skin damage caused by fine-particulate matter."
