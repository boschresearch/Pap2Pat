                        "With the global industrialization, atmospheric pollutants have caused serious human health problems. The World Health Organization identified four major air pollutants in its air quality guidelines, namely PM, ground ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Of all these substances, PM2.5 is a tiny PM substance with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 \u03bcm. PM2.5, as the main component of air pollutants, impose significant threats to the cardiovascular system, respiratory system and skin. In addition, PM2.5 has a large surface area that absorbs chemical contaminants and metal ions. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to airborne PM activates aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AhR) on the skin cell membranes, leading to skin aging, wrinkles and pigmentation. In addition, atmospheric pollutants can also induce and exacerbate the atopic dermatitis and other skin diseases.",
                        "The stratum corneum (SC) has a structure similar to bricks and mortar. \u201cBricks\u201d refer to cornified keratinocytes, while \u201cmortar\u201d refers to the lipid components filled between them, including free fatty acids, ceramides and cholesterol. These three lipid components are stacked in a highly ordered three-dimensional structure, gluing the cells together to form a strong skin barrier. The function of the skin barrier depends on the integrity of the SC, especially the composition of lipids in it. Di Nardo A et al., have found that the skin barrier of patients with atopic dermatitis is impaired, with reduced level of ceramides, increased level of cholesterol, and lower ceramide/cholesterol ratios in SC."

                        "The first aspect of the present invention provides an application of the substances in the cholesterol metabolism pathway in the evaluation of the effects of PMs on the skin. In some embodiments, these substances are substances that directly affect cholesterol metabolism or indirectly affect cholesterol levels, participating in cholesterol synthesis and metabolism.",
                        "The so-called \u201cparticipation\u201d is that these substances can affect the synthesis or metabolism of cholesterol. These substances can be specific to genes. The level of transcription, translation, or the amount or activity of enzymes, substrates, precursors affected by gene expression, all of which are caused by PMs acting on the skin. In some ways, the metabolism of cholesterol occurs in whole or in part in the SC of the skin.",
                        "In some embodiments, these substances include enzymes in the cholesterol metabolism pathway, or direct products synthesized at stages or steps under the action of these enzymes, or one or both of the two. These direct products include, but are not limited to, cholesterol, squalene and other substances. The so-called metabolic pathway of direct products starting with cholesterol metabolism, in the action of the enzymes, the changes of the amount of some intermediate products, such as ATP Citrate Lyase, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase, Acyl-CoA Synthetase Short Chain Family Member 2, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1, Mevalonate Diphosphate Decarboxylase, Changes in direct substances such as acetate, citrate, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, \u03b2-Hydroxy \u03b2-methylglutaryl-CoA, mevalonate, mevalonic acid-5-P, mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, squalene, squalene-2,3epoxide, lanosterol, etc. can be used to indicate the damage of PMs to the skin.",
                        "In other embodiments, it can also be some in direct substances involved in the cholesterol metabolism pathway, such as the various enzymes listed above. The synthesis of these enzymes directly affects the synthesis or amount of upstream substrates. The enzymes can be one or more of the following: ATP Citrate Lyase, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase, Acyl-CoA Synthetase Short Chain Family Member 2, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1, Mevalonate Diphosphate Decarboxylase, Methylsterol Monooxygenase 1, Methylsterol Monooxygenase 1, Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase 1, Squalene Epoxidase, Lanosterol Synthase, Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor, Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase, Fatty Acid Synthase.",
                        "In some embodiments, it can also be one or more of the direct products, or one or several of the indirect substances, or the combination of direct product and indirect substances, to assess the effect of PMs on the skin SC. Cholesterol metabolism pathways are common knowledge, but existing technology does not draw connection between cholesterol metabolism and PM, and the present invention found that the metabolic pathway of cholesterol was directly affected by PMs. In some ways, cholesterol or squalene in the metabolic pathway of cholesterol is used to assess the effects of PM on the SC.",
                        "The second aspect of the present invention provides a method for evaluating the effect of the active ingredient on mitigating the impact of PM from the atmosphere, e.g. PM2.5, on the skin; or provides a screening method for active ingredients which mitigate the impact of PM from the atmosphere, e.g. PM2.5, on the skin. In some embodiments, the evaluation or screening of the impact of PM from the atmosphere, e.g. PM2.5, on the skin is provided. Here, the so-called impact generally refers to harmful or damage effects of PMs from the atmosphere, which are detrimental or damage to skin. This adverse effect is caused by PMs interfering with the metabolic pathway of cholesterol in the SC of the skin.",
                        "In some embodiments, the evaluation or screening of active ingredients is to see what the effects of these so-called active ingredients on the skin are, such as exacerbating, worsening the adverse effect, or having no effect, or having the effect of improving and repairing the damage caused by harmful PMs, and helping the development of normal skin.",
                        "In some embodiments, the active ingredient has an intervention effect on the adverse effects of PMs, which refers to preventing the exacerbation of skin damage and the improvement, repair or treatment of skin damage.",
                        "In some embodiments, the method here includes having the active ingredient to be tested to treat the skin, and if the relevant substance in the cholesterol metabolism pathway changes in the skin, the effect of the active ingredient measured is judged by the change. In some ways, the effects include making the skin more damaged or improved post the impact of PM, such as PM2.5, resulting in damage reduction, or damage repair. On the other hand, changes in related substances include an increase in some substances or a decrease in some substances associated with or directly related to the effects of the injury. In some ways, for example, an increase in cholesterol indicates that the active ingredient does not improve the skin with regard to the damage of PM, such as PM2.5. Otherwise it has a good effect on the skin. Also for example, an increase in squalene indicates that the active ingredient has a positive effect on the skin with regard to the damage of PM, such as PM2.5. Otherwise it has no improvement. That is, it may not work or do the opposite. By this method, some active ingredients can be effectively screened, which can reverse the effect of PM on cholesterol metabolism pathway. When there is no additional active ingredient, the PMs can change the course of cholesterol metabolism, eventually increasing cholesterol to higher than normal level. When an additional active ingredient is applied, it can change cholesterol metabolism pathway, eventually return cholesterol to normal levels, such substances are effective ingredients. Of course, substances that do not affect the direction of the synthetic pathway of cholesterol can be considered ineffective active ingredients. Optionally, one can also identify or screen out a class of substances; such substances act on skin, changing or affecting the metabolic pathway of cholesterol, and ultimately increase cholesterol. Such substances are harmful substances.",
                        "In some embodiments, when, before and after PMs act on the skin, including one or more of skin tissues, skin cells, SC cells, SC tissues, or three-dimensional model skin, or in the action process, let active ingredients act on skin, skin tissues, skin cells, SC cells, SC tissues, or three-dimensional models and detect the changes in cholesterol metabolism-related substances, to screen effective, ineffective or harmful active ingredients according to the changes. In some embodiments, effective active ingredients are ultimately available and can be used to alleviate adverse effects of PMs on the skin. In some embodiments, the skin tissues, skin cells, SC cells and SC tissues are in vitro tissues or cells, of course, optionally, can be non-in vitro skin tissue, skin cells, SC cells and SC tissues.",
                        "In a third aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides the use of active ingredients in preparing reagents for alleviating damage of atmospheric PMs to the skin. In some embodiments, active ingredients may be used in personal care reagents that have anti-pollution, anti-haze effects, such as skin care products, clean bath products, or some care products.",
                        "These active ingredients may be obtained by screening through the foregoing methods. These active ingredients include, but are not limited to, polyphenols. In some embodiments, these polyphenols can be any polyphenol, such as polyphenols extracted from plants, animals or microbes. In some embodiments, polyphenols down-regulate HMGCS1, LDLR, and FASN in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, causing the final cholesterol level to tend to stabilize.",
                        "Although it has been found in the prior art that polyphenols have anti-inflammatory and anti-antioxidant effects, no one has found that polyphenols can improve the effect of micro-particles on the skin, especially without changing the cholesterol metabolism pathway.",
                        "Therefore, in a fourth aspect, the present invention provides the uses of polyphenols in preparing reagents that can improve the adverse effects of PMs on the skin. In some embodiments, the polyphenols are derived from plants, microbial fermentation products, mammals. In some preferred embodiments, the green plant is Camellia sinensis. In some preferred embodiments, the polyphenols are tea polyphenols. In some embodiments, the PMs are atmospheric PMs, for example, PM2.5. In some embodiments, the adverse effects of PMs on the skin include the effect of PMs on the skin SC. In some embodiments, the effect of PMs on the skin SC includes the effect of PMs on cholesterol metabolism-related substances in SC.",
                        "In some embodiments, the cholesterol metabolism-related substances include genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. In some embodiments, the genes include one or more genes of ACLY, ACSS2, HMGCR, HMGCS1, MVD, MSMD1, FDFT1, SQLE, LSS, LDLR or SCD, FASN, INSIGL. Preferably, the genes are HMGCS1, LDLR and FASN.",
                        "In some embodiments, the cholesterol metabolism-related substances include enzymes involved in the cholesterol metabolism pathway. In some embodiments, the enzymes include one or more of ATP Citrate Lyase, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase, Acyl-CoA Synthetase Short Chain Family Member 2, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1, Mevalonate Diphosphate Decarboxylase, Methylsterol Monooxygenase 1, Methylsterol Monooxygenase 1, Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase 1, Squalene Epoxidase, Lanosterol Synthase, Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor, Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase, Fatty Acid Synthase.",

In some embodiments, the cholesterol metabolism-related substance is cholesterol.",
                        "The effective substances screened by the foregoing method can be used for various purposes, for example, applied to the skin surface to alleviate adverse effects of PMs on the skin. These substances and active ingredients can be used as some specific forms to prepare cosmetic reagents, to improve, prevent, and reverse the adverse effects of PMs on the skin, thereby repairing the barrier, so that the skin can be protected, to avoid or mitigate the hazards of PMs. In some preferred embodiments, wherein the agent is a skin care preparation, and the skin care agents include substances screened by the foregoing methods, such as polyphenols. Sin care preparations may be in any form, and may be one of the solutions, water agents, suspensions, masks, lotions, creams, pastes, gels, dry powders, wet powders, sprays. Of course, these agents can be mammalian or human care product agents such as skin care, cleansing, beauty, bathing, and toiletries.",
                        "In addition to cholesterol metabolism-related genes, we firstly discovered that genes that have not been previously reported or are directly or indirectly related to PM2.5 further include S100A8, S100A9, Krt6b, TXNRD1, FGFBP1, MT2A, CD9, AREG, ITGB1, LAMB3, LAMA3.",
                        "Therefore, in a fifth aspect of the invention, S100A8, S100A9, Krt6b, TXNRD1, FGFBP1, MT2A, CD9, AREG, ITGB1, LAMB3 or LAMA3 genes are up-regulated in PM2.5-stimulated keratinocytes. That is, the up-regulation of expressions of these genes leads to some adverse effects under the action of PM2.5, for example the following adverse effects of up-regulation of these genes. Conversely, as described above, if some active ingredients applied can reverse, improve or repair the adverse effects caused by up-regulation of these genes, the substances have corresponding functions, and such adverse effects are directly caused by PMs in the atmosphere, for example, PM2.5. For example, when some substances are applied to skin, for example, to the SC cells, it is found that S100A8, S100A9 gene expression is not up-regulated, for example, down-regulation of the latter does not change, indicating that the substance can improve or repair or treat specific dermatitis, which is directly caused by PM2.5.",
                        "S100A8 and S100A9 belong to S100 protein family and are distributed in the granular layer, the spinous layer and the basal layer. Their main role is to involve in the host defense process related to NADPH oxidase activation. Studies have shown that the two S100 proteins play an important role in epidermal wound repair, differentiation and stress response, and their expression levels are extremely low in normal epidermis, but are very high in the skin of psoriasis patients, and their expression levels are proven to be up-regulated in the skin of specific dermatitis. Krt6b belongs to the keratin family and can characterize the keratinocyte division rate, which is a typical marker of wound healing, and is up-regulated in skin diseases such as specific dermatitis and ichthyosis, etc. TXNRD1 encodes a thioredoxin reductase and is a typical antioxidant gene, which is regulated by Nrf2 transcription factor. FGFBP1 encodes a fibroblast growth factor binding protein that is involved in the regulation of skin cell division and is associated with wound healing and angiogenesis. MT2A is a metal-binding protein that can promote cell proliferation, and it has been found that its expression level is associated with the formation of skin scar. CD9 is a cell surface protein that is involved in a variety of biological processes, such as wound healing, by coupling the signaling of intracellular signals. AREG amphiregulin functions in inflammatory epidermal hyperplasia and sebaceous gland enlargement, and it has been reported that its expression in human airway epithelial cells is up-regulated under the influence of PM2.5. LAM laminin is involved in wound healing and host defense. ITG integrin mediates adhesion of skin cells and is closely related to wound healing and inflammatory response. It is stimulated by mechanical stress and external damage to maintain the skin homeostasis.",

                                "Skin SC plays an important barrier function in the external environment. It is the structure that is in direct contact with pollutants in the environment firstly. The toxic substances adsorbed by PMs will damage the normal barrier function of the skin. The skin barrier is composed of keratinocytes and lipid components between keratinocytes. Cholesterol, ceramide, and free fatty acids are the main barrier lipids; their ratio and type determine the normal functions of barrier. It has been demonstrated that the acute barrier damage caused by tape tearing or acetone will affect the cholesterol level in the SC.",
                                "The team members of the present invention are surprised to find that atmospheric PM, such as PM2.5, has an important influence on the metabolic pathway of cholesterol. Some genes involved in the cholesterol metabolism pathway have significantly increased expression levels relative to the normal state, while some genes have significantly decreased expression levels. These genes may have direct impact on the content or activity of enzymes, substrates or intermediates that cause the cholesterol metabolism pathway. Of course, genes may not have a direct correspondence but an indirect relationship with these enzymes, substrates or intermediates. For example, genes directly affect the amount or activity of enzymes, and the enzymes indirectly affect the synthesis of intermediates or precursors related to the cholesterol metabolism.",
                                "Another surprising finding is that atmospheric PM, for example PM2.5, can directly affect some of the related substances in the cholesterol metabolism pathway, thereby increasing or decreasing the expression of genes in the cholesterol metabolism pathway or enzymes affecting these substances. As a result, the level of cholesterol is finally increased relative to normal level. Still another surprising finding is that the atmospheric PMs, for example PM2.5, increase the level of cholesterol in the epidermis, while the level of squalene, the precursor for cholesterol synthesis is decreased.",
                                "This is contrary to some conventional understandings in the prior art. Although studies have shown that lipid components can be used to measure barrier integrity, there is no definitive conclusion about the effects of air pollutants, especially PMs, on cholesterol and its associated metabolites in SC. A series of clinical trials conducted worldwide from 1999 to 2014 have showed that residents living in areas with severe air pollution have high levels of sebum oxidation and lower SC integrity. However, study results in Mexico and Shanghai revealed that people living in heavily polluted areas have higher levels of sebum and a lower squalene/cholesterol ratio, but the cholesterol level has no significant change. This indicates that, atmospheric PMs or PMs formed by atmospheric pollution seem to have no direct effect on the lipid composition in SC, especially the final product cholesterol. However, in the present invention, in fact, atmospheric PMs or PMs formed by atmospheric pollution may directly affect various stages of cholesterol synthesis route, thereby ultimately interfering with cholesterol synthesis and increasing its relative content (relative to the normal content) in SC.",
                                "In the present invention, using a representative substance in atmospheric PM and PM2.5-treated primary human epidermal keratinocytes (pHEK), the effect of PM2.5 on the skin barrier is analyzed based on the obtained transcriptomics results. It is found that numerous up-regulated genes are associated with cholesterol metabolism. The transcriptomics results allow us to focus on changes in expressions of cholesterol metabolism-related genes. Based on the changes in the transcriptional levels of these genes, a PM2.5 treatment model is constructed using in vitro three-dimensional epidermal tissue (3D-ETM) to conduct experiments and investigate the effect of PM2.5 on the contents of cholesterol and squalene, the cholesterol precursor. A correlation analysis is performed from gene expression changes and cholesterol metabolic routes, and it is found that the transcription of these altered genes is closely related to the cholesterol metabolic route, therefore, it is believed that the atmospheric PMs affect the cholesterol metabolic route in the epidermal tissues, or the cholesterol metabolic route in the SC, thereby eventually leading to an increased cholesterol level and a decreased level of cholesterol precurs or squalene.",
                                "In addition, it is found that the up-regulation of some genes that are not directly related to cholesterol metabolism is directly caused by atmospheric PMs, such as PM2.5. These genes are also our new findings."

For example, the adverse effect of PMs on the skin can be indicated by the reduction or degree of reduction of some genes at the level of transcription. On the contrary, it indicates the extent of improvement and reversal of skin by PMs. In some embodiments, the gene markers at the molecular level include one or more genes of ACLY, ACSS2, HMGCR, HMGCS1, MVD, MSMD1, FDFT1, SQLE, LSS, LDLR or SCD, FASN, INSIGL. The elevated levels of transcription of these genes indicate the increase in the adverse effects of PMs on the skin; conversely, a decrease in the transcriptional level of these genes indicates that the adverse effects of the PMs on the skin are improved or reversed. For example, some active ingredients act on the skin and some genes are found to be down-regulated at the transcriptional level (relative to the effect of PMs alone), indicating that these active ingredients have the effect of improving or reversing the adverse effects, and the degree of down-regulation indicates the extent of improving or reversing adverse effects by the active ingredients.",

Generally, this effect may change the activity or content of various enzymes in the synthetic route, or the level of transcription of genes associated with the enzymes, which ultimately leads to a cholesterol level higher than normal level, and thereby causing a change in the ratio of skin SC lipid components and abnormal barrier functions. This effect actually refers to effect on skin damage. For active ingredients, the effect of this active ingredient on the skin may be to reverse the adverse effects of PMs on the skin or to worsen or intensify the adverse effects of PMs on the skin; of course, optionally, these active ingredients may not have any function. At the molecular level, these active ingredients generally cause down-regulation or up-regulation of some genes, or down-regulation or up-regulation of a plurality of genes, which ultimately presents different effects.

The various particulate materials are uniformly dispersed in the air to form a relatively stable and bulky suspension system, that is, an aerosol system. Therefore, atmospheric particulate matters are also called atmospheric aerosols (Hinds, wC Aerosol Technology: Properties, Behavior, And Measurement of Airborne Particles [M], Wiley, 1999, New York). Fine PMs are also known as fine particles, PM2.5. Fine PMs refer to particulate matter (PM2.5) with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of 2.5 microns or less in ambient air. Compared with larger atmospheric particulate matters, PM2.5 has small particle size, large area, strong activity, is easy to attach toxic and harmful substances (such as heavy metals, microorganisms, etc.), and has a long residence time and a long transport distance in the atmosphere. Therefore, it has a greater impact on human health and quality of atmospheric environment.",
                                "Of course, in addition to the PMs in the atmosphere, there are also PMs in special environments, such as PMs in local range, for example, PMs in some specific plant environments may have effect on the skin."

In some methods or uses, the aforementioned biomarkers are used as indicators to screen such active ingredients, thereby improving and reversing the adverse effect of PMs on the skin. In some methods, before, when and after PMs act on the skin or in the process of action, active ingredients to be tested are applied. If the content or activity of the biomarkers (cholesterol metabolism-related substances) changes, the biomarkers are associated with the active ingredients to be tested, thereby obtaining a type of substances that can improve, reverse the adverse effects of PMs on the skin or can worsen and accelerate the adverse effects of PMs on the skin. In some methods, when the cholesterol level is increased (relative to normal level), it indicates that the active ingredient has no beneficial effect. Conversely, if the cholesterol level is reduced or not increased, it indicates that the active ingredients have an advantageous effect, for example, improving or reversing the adverse effects of PMs. One of ordinary skill in the art will know that biomarkers in the cholesterol metabolism pathway can be detected by such methods, and the changes in activity or contents and the effect of active ingredients are readily available. The \u201cassociation\u201d herein means that the action of active ingredients is directly related to changes in substances associated with the cholesterol metabolism pathway, and through the changes, effective, ineffective or harmful active ingredients can be obtained. For example, when active ingredients are added to make the cholesterol level to normal, the active ingredients are considered to be effective substances. This relationship can be positive or negative, of course, it may be unrelated.",

                                "We investigate the intervention of some active ingredients (for example, plant-derived ingredients) on PM2.5-induced skin damage using the above method. In some embodiments, Camellia Sinensis is a traditional economic plant that can be processed by varying degrees of fermentation. Green tea is made from fresh tea leaves and undergoes a fine drying step to avoid oxidation and polymerization of phenols. Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG), a monomeric flavanol, is found to be the major polyphenol in green tea.",
                                "Tea polyphenols are known to have potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation effects in vitro and in vivo. Studies have shown that tea polyphenols can reduce skin edema and erythema caused by UV rays, and protect DNA from damage by UV. In this study, we have found that the role of polyphenol-rich tea polyphenols is to reverse the effect of PM2.5 on skin gene expression at the transcriptome level, and we have validated the change in key lipid biomarkers in 3D-ETM by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).",
                                "Therefore, another important finding of the present invention is that polyphenols can reverse the effect of PM2.5 on skin gene expressions, and finally under the effect of PMs, the cholesterol synthesis in SC is at a normal level or its precursor and squalene are also at a normal level. That is to say, these polyphenols can repair the negative effects of PMs on SC (for example, reducing the content of cholesterol in the SC), such that the cholesterol in the SC maintains normal levels. On the other hand, these polyphenols can prevent or prevent the negative effects of PMs on SC (for example, maintaining the normal content of cholesterol in SC), so that the cholesterol in SC is maintained at a normal level without being affected by PMs in the external air pollution. Thus, polyphenols can reverse, repair, and prevent the adverse effects of cholesterol in SC, allowing it to be at a normal level, for example, lowering the cholesterol level when elevated, or preventing possible or potential increase of cholesterol. Moreover, in terms of the mechanism, the present invention also demonstrates that tea polyphenols down-regulate the transcription levels of HMGCS1, LDLR and FASN genes in the cholesterol metabolism pathway (these genes are up regulated under the action of PM2.5), thereby ultimately allowing cholesterol to be maintained at a relatively normal level in the SC. Polyphenols are actually a general term for a type of mixtures. The content of polyphenols from different sources may be varied, but the overall mechanism of action has no substantial difference. Therefore, it will be readily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that any polyphenol has the similar function of the tea polyphenols of the present invention when reading the specification of this patent.",

In another embodiment, polyphenols are extracts from green plants, for example, plant polyphenol. A plant polyphenol is a kind of secondary metabolite with polyphenolic structure that are widely distributed in plants, mainly in the skin, roots, leaves and fruits of plants. In the narrow sense, a plant polyphenol is tannins or tannic acids, and its relative molecular mass is between 500 and 3000; in a broad sense, it further includes small molecular phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, catechins, quercetin, gallic acid, ellagic acid, arbutin and other natural phenols. Tea polyphenols (TP), also known as tea tannins, is a generic term for a class of polyhydroxy compounds contained in Camellia sinensis, accounting for about 20% of the dry weight of Camellia sinensis. Its main component is catechins, accounting for about 80% of its total amount. In addition, it also contains flavanols, flavanones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins and their aglycones. Among various Camellia sinensis, green tea has the highest content of tea polyphenols, about 15% to 25% of the dry weight of Camellia sinensis, followed by oolong tea and black tea. In addition to tea polyphenols, it can be any polyphenols such as apple polyphenols, polyphenols of grapes and grape wines, polyphenols in beer, and polyphenols in plant polyphenol vegetables.",

Among more than 1,000 substances detected in wine, a variety of polyphenols, including anthocyanidins, flavonoids, phenolic acids and resveratrols are contained. The polyphenol content in wine is determined by potassium permanganate method, which is 1\u02dc3 g/L on average. In addition, the astringency and bitterness of red wine are mostly derived from phenolic substances, and the ruby color of red wine is also closely related to the content of polyphenols.",
                                "There are many kinds of polyphenols in beer, including flavanols, flavonols, anthocyanins and phenolic acids [5], among which, more than 50 kinds of proanthocyanidins are detected. About 80% of the polyphenols in beer come from barley, and about 20% come from hops. The content of polyphenols in malt is about 0.1% to 0.3%, mainly in the husk and aleurone layer, and little in the endosperm. Polyphenols in lupulus mainly exist in the anterior leaves and lupulin of lupulus, accounting for 2% to 4% of dry weight. Polyphenols are closely related to the quality of beer, and their content has an important influence on the non-biological stability, taste, foam and color of beers.",

                                "The composition and source of PM2.5 in different regions are varied. In this experiment, a chemical analysis on PM2.5 samples collected from Xi'an, China was conducted. PM2.5 contains complex components such as metal ions, toxic organic compounds and inorganic substances. The elemental composition analysis showed that S, Zn and Fe were the top three elemental compositions of PM2.5 used in the experiment. Zn and Fe were one of the most abundant crust elements, indicating that dust emission is an important source of the samples. Moreover, high concentrations of S, NO3\u2212 and SO42\u2212 indicated that coal combustion emissions were another important source. Sulfate and nitrate were mainly from the oxidation of SO2 and NOX and were believed to be mainly produced by coal combustions in the locality. In addition, studies have shown that the OC/EC of coal combustion emissions is 2.5-10.5, and in this experiment, OC/EC is 5.25, which demonstrates the main contribution of coal combustion emissions. Therefore, we consider the PM2.5 samples to be a typical source of coal and dust.",
                                "From the above analysis, we conclude that the composition of the PMs is complex and is affected by the local natural environment. However, in any case, although the PMs have different compositions and contents of harmful substances in different places, but the types of harmful substances are similar, for example, dust is almost an important source of all PMs. Dust is mainly composed of crustal elements, although these elements seem harmless to the human body, if they form PMs, they will be extremely harmful to the human body. One of the hazards of PMs is the damage to the skin barrier.",

In some specific embodiments, it is manifested by the direct effect of PMs on the cholesterol metabolism pathway in skin SC, for example, effect of PMs on the elevated cholesterol levels in the SC.",

Referring to FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, experimental results showed that, after cells were cultured with PM2.5 medium at different concentration gradients for 24 hours, the cell viability was observed to decrease significantly with the increase of PM2.5 concentration, when the concentration of PM2 exceeded 50 \u03bcg/mL, a large amount of cell fragments appeared (FIG. 1B). Morphologically, after cells were treated with C(PM2.5)>50 \u03bcg/mL for 24 hours, the cell viability decreased gradually in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 1B). When the PM2.5 dose was increased to 50 \u03bcg/mL, the cells showed obvious morphological changes, some cell fragments began to appear, cells were shrunk, but the number of adherent cells had no significant change. At a higher concentration of PM2.5, cells were shrunk, rounded and floated, and the number of adherent cells was significantly reduced. Therefore, we chose 50 \u03bcg/mL as the maximum safe dose of PM2.5 in the subsequent experiments. At such concentrations, although the cells were damaged, the viability of the cells was not significantly affected, which was advantageous for subsequent experiments. However, in any case, as shown from FIG. 1A, with the gradual increase in the concentration of PM2.5, the viability of cells decreased, and the higher the concentration, the more obvious the rate of decline. This indicated that PM2.5 had a significant effect on cells. Cells are the smallest unit of organisms and important component of SC.

Among them, S100A8 and S100A9 belong to the S100 protein family and are distributed in the granular layer, spinous layer and basal layer. Their main function is to involve in the host defense process related to NADPH oxidase activation. Studies have shown that S100A8 and S100A9 played an important role in epidermal wound repair, differentiation and stress response; and they were expressed at very low levels in normal epidermis, but were abundantly expressed in the skin of psoriasis patients and proved to be up-regulated in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. Krt6b belongs to the Keratin family and can characterize the division rate of keratinocytes. It is a typical marker of wound healing. Krt6b is up-regulated in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis, etc. TXNRD1, encoding thioredoxin reductase, is a typical anti-oxidation gene and is regulated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. FGFBP1 encodes a fibroblast growth factor binding protein that is involved in the regulation of skin cell division and is associated with wound healing and angiogenesis. MT2A is a metal-binding protein that can promote cell proliferation, and it has been found that its expression level is associated with the skin scar formation. CD9 is a cell surface protein that involves in many biological processes, such as wound healing, by coupling the signaling of intracellular signals. AREG amphiregulin plays a role in inflammatory epidermal hyperplasia and sebaceous gland enlargement, and it has been reported that its expression in human airway epithelial cells is up-regulated under the influence of PM2.5. LAM laminin is involved in wound healing and host defense. ITG integrin mediates adhesion of skin cells and is closely related to wound healing and inflammatory response. It is stimulated to maintain skin homeostasis when the skin is subjected to mechanical stress and external damage.

To gain a deep understanding of the unique pathways and protein networks that respond to PM2.5 stimuli, we used the online database Metascape to analyze gene ontology (GO) molecular entries (biological processes, molecular function and cellular localization) and KEGG pathways of significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes (http://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1).",

The genes that were significantly up-regulated compared to the control group after PM2.5 treatment (pad j<0.001) were used for analysis. The results were shown in FIG. 2, among the top 20 GO entries and routes, the most significantly enriched GO entry was the cholesterol biosynthesis process (GO:GO: 0006695), indicating that PM2.5 was highly likely to affect cholesterol biosynthesis or PM2.5 was directly related to the metabolism of cholesterol. In addition, the response to lipoprotein particles (GO:0055094) was also one of the most enriched entries, indicating there existed a close relationship between PM2.5 and cholesterol in cells. Further, inflammation-related pathways such as the IL-17 signaling pathway (hsa04657) and interleukin-10 signaling (R-HSA-6783783) were also highly enriched. At the same time, the response to wound healing (GO: 0009611) and the regulation of wound healing (GO: 0061041) also ranked the top 20, indicating the stimulation of skin inflammatory responses. The positive regulation of the apoptotic process (GO:0043065) and the cellular oxidant detoxification (GO:0098869) pathway revealed that PM2.5 could induce apoptosis and intracellular oxidative clearance as defense responses.",
                                "In short, through functional annotation analysis, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, inflammatory and oxidative stress pathway, and closely related apoptotic pathway are the most significantly stimulated pathways in keratinocytes treated with PM2.5 and are also directly associated with PM2.5. (FIG. 2). GO analysis showed abnormal cholesterol metabolism in keratinocytes after treated with PM2.5. Because lipids are a major component of the cell membrane and an important component of SC, it is essential to maintain normal functions of the skin barrier. This suggests that PM2.5 changes the cholesterol metabolism pathway, which causes normal metabolism of cholesterol and changes in SC, thereby impairing the barrier functions of the skin.",

Some of the genes associated with cholesterol metabolism were listed in Table 4, and the changes in expression levels of the genes compared to the controls were plotted in FIG. 3. The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was shown in FIG. 6. According to FIG. 3, Table 4 and FIG. 6, PM2.5 could significantly change the content of direct substances in the cholesterol metabolism route, and also indirectly affect the changes of main enzymes in the cholesterol metabolism route, causing changes in the entire route and eventually up-regulating the cholesterol level (relative to untreated normal SC cells (controls)). This further provided that PM2.5 has a direct correlation with the cholesterol metabolism in SC, which is a new discovery of the present invention.",
                                "In general, for example, as shown in FIG. 6, the cholesterol metabolism process is divided into three stages. Firstly, acetyl-CoA forms mevalonic acid; secondly, two mevalonic acids are condensed into isoprene and to form squalene; and thirdly, squalene is converted to cholesterol. Both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis begin with the common precursor acetyl-CoA, which is derived from the catabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.",
                                "Among the genes induced by PM2.5, 13 genes were significantly up-regulated, as shown in Table 4, FIG. 3 and FIG. 6. ACLY and ACSS2 were involved in the production of acetyl-CoA. HMGCS1 and HMGCR were involved in the first stage of cholesterol metabolism. MVD and FDFT1 were involved in the second stage of cholesterol metabolism. LSS and SQLE were involved in the synthesis of lanosterol from squalene in the third stage of cholesterol metabolism. LDLR encodes a protein receptor that binds to the carrier of cholesterol-LDL, which is essential for the uptake of cholesterol into cells. Therefore, the up-regulation of these genes under stimulation of PM2.5 may lead to an increase in cholesterol metabolism. As shown from FIG. 3, 13 genes were significantly up-regulated, which affected the synthesis route of cholesterol and finally increased the cholesterol level. In addition, INSIG1 plays an important role in regulating cholesterol metabolism in the skin, by regulating the transcription of the transcription factor SREBP/SCAP (a regulatory factor of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis) and HMG-CoA reductase (rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol metabolism), the steady state of cholesterol in the skin was maintained. FASN, as another major rate-limiting enzyme of barrier lipid fatty acid synthesis, has also been shown to be closely related to cholesterol synthesis. The up-regulation of FASN activity can promote cholesterol production by regulating acetyl-CoA. This fully demonstrates that PM2.5 can directly or indirectly change the gene expression or the activity or quantity of enzymes, or the number of substrates regardless of the levels of genes, enzymes or substrates, there by ultimately increasing the cholesterol level relative to the controls. Thus, it proves that the damage of skin barrier is directly related to PM2.5. In addition, if some external active ingredients can be reversed, for example, down-regulating one or more of up-regulated genes, or lowering the activity of the enzymes, or decreasing or increasing the precursor or substrate, these changes will eventually cause the cholesterol levels to be at a normal state. These active ingredients are effective substances.",

The specific results were shown in Table 5. Compared with cells treated with PM2.5 alone, the addition of GTE resulted in the significant up-regulation of 22 genes and the significant down-regulation of 52 genes. The changes of these genes involved the changes in multiple metabolic processes.",
                                "Tea polyphenols affect a number of pathways closely related to inflammatory responses. Among the significantly down-regulated genes involved, IL-la is a recognized inflammatory marker and is closely related to the occurrence of acne; matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MMP-1), as a biomarker for collagen degradation, is induced under thermal conditions or UV stress; for numerous HSP families, including heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP9OAA1), heat shock protein family A (HSP70) member 8 (HSPA8), their expressions will be stimulated under different stresses or external stimuli to protect the skin; S100A9 (calgranulin B or MRP-14) is a model molecule closely related to damage, which is up-regulated in many inflammatory skin diseases. Therefore, tea polyphenols mainly relieve the inflammatory responses induced by PM2.5.",
                                "The regulatory effect of GTE on the above genes has been reported in the existing literatures. However, we found for the first time that the addition of GTE (tea polyphenols) to the PM2.5-treated cells would significantly down-regulate the expressions of HMGCS1, LDLR and FASN in the cholesterol metabolism pathway, as shown in FIG. 4. These genes were significantly up-regulated when treated with PM2.5 alone (as shown in Table 3). This suggested that the protective effect of GTE (tea polyphenols) on cells was to reverse the adverse effects of PM2.5 on cholesterol metabolism of keratinocytes, thereby maintaining cholesterol metabolism in a stable state. This further indicated that tea polyphenols could reverse the effect of PMs on the synthesis of cholesterol in skin SC, which would be further demonstrated in detail later. At the same time, we conducted similar experiments using other sources of polyphenols (plant extracts, microbial fermentation, animal sources, of which plant sources include Camellia sinensis, apples, etc.) and found that it could reverse the expression levels of some genes under the PM2.5 stimulation conditions shown in Table 3, which mainly down-regulated the expressions of HMGCS1, LDLR and FASN (experimental data were omitted). This further confirmed that, any substance that can down-regulate the expression levels of genes in FIG. 3 can reverse the adverse effects of PM2.5 on the skin and help maintain cholesterol at normal levels. It is also demonstrated from another aspect that if the substance related to the cholesterol anabolic pathway changes, it indicates that the changes are caused by the adverse effects of PMs on the skin, providing a new evidence of adverse effect of PMs on the skin. Because there are numerous substances affecting the cholesterol metabolism pathway and the influencing factors are extremely complicated, at least we can take the effect of PM2.5 as a possibility when analyzing the cholesterol metabolism of SC. Thus, it can be specifically used to develop or screen some active ingredients that have an adverse effect on the skin due to PM2.5. These active ingredients are used to improve and repair the skin as a new way of skin damage caused by PMs, for example, PM2.5.",

After that, the cholesterol level was dropped, and basically similar to the control group on the 6th day. The cholesterol precursor showed a downward trend over time. This further demonstrated that, as the expression of some genes in the cholesterol metabolism pathway was significantly up-regulated, affecting the cholesterol metabolism pathway, the cholesterol level was eventually increased.",

For example, as shown in FIG. 5B, the cholesterol level remained basically unchanged in the blank control, but under the action of PM2.5, it was significantly higher than that of the control, and on the second day, it increased most, and then decreased. When PM2.5 and GTE were used simultaneously, the cholesterol level could be significantly inhibited at a normal level, or at least close to the normal level of the control. This fully demonstrated that the cholesterol level can be used to reflect that polyphenols can effectively improve and reverse the adverse effects of PM2.5 on the skin.",
                                "The above experimental results showed that PM2.5 induced the expressions of enzymes involved in the cholesterol metabolism process after contact with the skin, and caused a significant increase in cholesterol level in the skin on the second day, while GTE could effectively suppress this trend, regardless of the second day or sixth day after treatment, there was no significant fluctuation in the cholesterol level in the skin tissues in the GTE treatment group. This further suggested that polyphenols could maintain its normal level under the adverse effects of PM2.5, which sufficiently demonstrated polyphenols had significant improvement or reversal effect on the adverse effects of PMs on the skin SC. One skilled in the art can readily appreciate that polyphenols can protect skin SC from the harmful effects of PM2.5, thereby leaving the skin under protection.",
                                "In addition, squalene, as an important intermediate in the cholesterol metabolism process, has also been shown to be an important marker of environmental pollution levels in the skin. Therefore, we also tested the content of squalene under PM2.5 treatment in the 3D skin models. The results in FIG. 5A showed that, under the stimulation of PM2.5, the changing trend of squalene was opposite to that of cholesterol, which was lower than that of the control group. The possible reason may be that the squalene is a direct precursor of cholesterol, when the cholesterol level increases, the level of squalene is relatively decreased.",
