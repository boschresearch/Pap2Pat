    "abstract": "A polynucleotide encoding a ThermoCas9 protein from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans and a constitutive promoter are used to engineer eukaryotic cells, e.g. fungi, yeast or algae, so that the ThermoCas9 endonuclease is integrated and expressed from the genome of the cell. Then, a second expression plasmid is used to transfect these ThermoCas9 expressing cells, the second plasmid containing an inducible promoter and a polynucleotide encoding a guide RNA. The guide RNA combines with the ThermoCas9 to provide the targeted endonuclease activity to cleave the cell DNA at a desired locus or gene of interest. A repair-oligo is also provided to the cell whereby following DNA cleavage, homologous recombination takes place in the cell with the repair-oligo so that either a deletion or substitution of nucleotides in the locus or gene of interest is achieved. Expression vectors and methods of using the vectors to achieve ThermoCas9 mediated gene editing are described whereby higher temperatures, e.g. greater than 30\u00b0 C., are used.",

The present invention concerns genetic engineering tools in the form of nucleases which can be configured for sequence-directed site-specific binding, nicking, cutting and modification of genetic material; also, ribonucleoproteins which exert activity, particularly nuclease activity, on sequence specific sites of genetic material, and modified nucleases and ribonucleoproteins for use as markers. The invention therefore also concerns associated expression constructs for delivery and expression of nucleases and guide RNAs within non-human cells. Further, the invention concerns the sequence-specific editing of nucleic acids in vitro or in vivo and methods used to achieve that. A particular area to which the invention relates is the genetic manipulation of thermophilic organisms, particularly microorganisms."

                        "It was first demonstrated in 2007 that CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system in many bacteria and most archaea (Barrangou et al., 2007, Science 315: 1709-1712), Brouns et al., 2008, Science 321: 960-964). Based on functional and structural criteria, two classes of CRISPR-Cas systems that each comprise three types have so far been characterized, most of which use small RNA molecules as guide to target complementary DNA sequences (Makarova et al., 2015, Nat Rev Microbiol 13: 722-736; Mahanraju et al., 2016, Science 353: aad5147).",
                        "In a recent study by the Doudna/Charpentier labs, a thorough characterization of the effector enzyme of the class 2/type II CRISPR-Cas system (Cas9) was performed, including demonstration that the introduction of designed CRISPR RNA guides (with specific spacer sequences) targets complementary sequences (protospacers) on a plasmid, causing double strand breaks of this plasmid (Jinek et al., 2012, Science 337: 816-821). Following Jinek et al., 2012, Cas9 is used as a tool for genome editing.",
                        "Cas9 has been used to engineer the genomes of a range of eukaryotic cells (e.g. fish, plant, man) (Charpentier and Doudna, 2013, Nature 495: 50-51).",
                        "In addition, Cas9 has been used to improve yields of homologous recombination in bacteria by selecting for dedicated recombination events (Jiang et al., 2013, Nature Biotechnol 31: 233-239). To achieve this, a toxic fragment (Targeting construct) is co-transfected with a rescuing fragment carrying the desired alteration (Editing construct, carrying point mutation or deletions). The Targeting construct consists of Cas9 in combination with a design CRISPR and an antibiotic resistance marker, defining the site of the desired recombination on the host chromosome; in the presence of the corresponding antibiotic, integration of the Targeting construct in the host chromosome is selected for. Only when the additional recombination occurs of the Editing construct with the CRISPR target site on the host chromosome, the host can escape from the auto-immunity problem. Hence, in the presence of the antibiotic, only the desired (marker-free) mutants are able to survive and grow. A related strategy to select for subsequent removal of the integrated Targeting construct from the chromosome is presented as well, generating a genuine marker free mutant.",
                        "It has been established in recent years that CRISPR-Cas mediated genome editing constitutes a useful tool for genetic engineering. It has been established that the prokaryotic CRISPR systems serve their hosts as adaptive immune systems (Jinek et al., 2012, Science 337: 816-821) and can be used for quick and effective genetic engineering (Mali et al., 2013, Nat Methods 10:957-963, for example), requiring only modification of the guide sequence in order to target sequences of interest.",
                        "However, there is a continuing need for the development of agents with improved sequence-specific nucleic acid detection, cleavage and manipulation under a variety of experimental conditions for application in the area of genetic research and genome editing. In particular, currently available sequence-specific genome editing tools, including Cas9, are not applicable for use in all conditions or organisms, for example, sequence-specific nucleases are relatively thermo-sensitive and therefore not applicable for use in strictly thermophilic microorganisms (which are capable of growth between 41\u00b0 C. and 122\u00b0 C. and grow optimally in the ranges of temperatures from >45\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C. with hyperthermophiles capable of optimal growth above 80\u00b0 C.), for example, microorganisms that are used in industrial fermentations or for in vitro laboratory processes conducted at elevated temperatures.",
                        "To date there is no experimental evidence for active Cas9 proteins in thermophiles. Based on a comparative genome screening by Chylinski et al. (2014; Nucleic Acids Research 42: 6091-61-05) on the presence of Cas9 in bacteria it was found that the Type II-C CRISPR-Cas system is only present in approximately 3.3% of all bacterial genomes. Among thermophilic bacteria, the Type II system is underrepresented based on statistical analysis (P=0.0019). In addition, no Type II system has been found in archaea however, this could possibly be due to the absence of the RNase III protein (involved in the Type II system) in archaea. Chylinski, et al., (2014; Nucleic Acids Research 42: 6091-6105) did describe the classification and evolution of type II CRISPR-Cas systems, in particular, two species are identified which exhibit these systems, however these species grow maximally at 55\u00b0 C. and do not exhibit strictly thermophilic growth with optimum growth temperature 60-80\u00b0 C., with hyperthermophiles capable of growing optimally above 80\u00b0 C.",
                        "Despite the rarity of the CRISPR-Cas system in bacterial genomes and in particular the fact that Cas9 has been found only in bacteria (not archaea) with optimal growth temperatures below 45\u00b0 C., the inventors have surprisingly discovered several thermostable Cas9 variants which enable genome editing to be carried out at elevated temperatures. The inventors have also discovered optimised protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences that work with the thermostable Cas9 variants to enable genome editing to be carried out over a wide range of temperatures, including at the elevated temperatures. These Cas9 nucleases, and RNA molecules that are designed with knowledge of the associated PAM sequences, provide novel tools for genetic engineering at elevated temperatures and are of particular value in the genetic manipulation of thermophilic organisms; particularly microorganisms.",
                        "A phylogenetic re-assessment of the thermophilic genus Geobacillus has recently been performed, which resulted in the creation of a new genus, Parageobacillus. Consequently, some species previously of the genus Geobacillus have been systematically re-assigned to Parageobacillus and re-named accordingly (Aliyu et al., (2016) Systematic and Applied Microbiology 39:527-533).",
                        "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide adaptive and heritable immunity in prokaryotes against invading genetic elements (Brouns et al. Science 321, (2008); Barrangou et al. CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes. Science 315, (2007); Wright et al. Cell 164, 29-44 (2016); Mohanraju et al. Science 353, aad5147 (2016)). CRISPR-Cas systems are subdivided into two classes (1 and 2) and six types (I-VI), depending on their complexity and signature protein (Makarova et al. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 13, 722-736 (2015)). Class 2 systems, including type-II CRISPR-Cas9 and type V CRISPR-Cas12a (previously called CRISPR-Cpf1) have recently been exploited as genome engineering tools for both eukaryotes (Komor et al. Cell 168, 20-36 (2017); Puchta, Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 36, 1-8 (2017); Xu et al. J. Genet. Genomics 42, 141-149 (2015); Tang et al. Nat. Plants 3, 17018 (2017); Zetsche et al. Nat. Biotechnol. 35, 31-34 (2016)) and prokaryotes (Mougiakos, et al. Trends Biotechnol. 34, 575-587 (2016)). These systems are among the simplest CRISPR-Cas systems known as they introduce targeted double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) based on a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formed by a single Cas endonuclease and an RNA guide.",
                        "To date, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is the best characterized and most widely employed Cas9 for genome engineering. Although a few other type-II systems have been characterized, none of them is derived from a thermophilic organism (Nakade, et al. Bioengineered 1-9 (2017). doi:10.1080/21655979.2017.1282018). Characterization of such CRISPR-Cas systems would be interesting to gain fundamental insights as well as to develop novel applications.",
                        "Although basic genetic tools are available for a number of thermophiles (Taylor et al. Microb. Biotechnol. 4, 438-448 (2011); Olson, et al. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 33, 130-141 (2015); Zeldes, et al. Front. Microbiol. 6, 1209 (2015)), the efficiency of these tools is still too low to enable full exploration and exploitation of this interesting group of organisms. Based on our finding that SpCas9 is not active in vivo \u226542\u00b0 C., we have previously developed an SpCas9-based engineering tool for facultative thermophiles, combining homologous recombination at elevated temperatures and SpCas9-based counter-selection at moderate temperatures (Mougiakos et al. ACS Synth. Biol. 6, 849-861 (2017)). However, a Cas9-based editing and silencing tool for obligate thermophiles is not yet available as SpCas9 is not active at or above 42\u00b0 C. (Mougiakos et al. ACS Synth. Biol. 6, 849-861 (2017)) and to date no thermophilic Cas9 has been characterized."

Affinity may be determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), also called gel retardation assay (see Semenova et al. (2011) PNAS 108: 10098-10103).",
                        "The targeting RNA molecule is preferably modeled on what are known from nature in prokaryotes as CRISPR RNA (crRNA) molecules. The structure of crRNA molecules is already established and explained in more detail in Jore et al., 2011, Nature Structural & Molecular Biology 18: 529-537. In brief, a mature crRNA of type I-E is often 61 nucleotides long and consists of a 5\u2032 \u201chandle\u201d region of 8 nucleotides, the \u201cspacer\u201d sequence of 32 nucleotides, and a 3\u2032 sequence of 21 nucleotides which form a hairpin with a tetranucleotide loop (FIG. 5). Type I systems differ from type II (Cas9) and details of different systems are described in Van der Oost 2014 Nat Rev Micr 12: 479-492. In type II (Cas9) systems there is a different processing mechanism, making use of a second RNA (tracrRNA) and two ribonucleases. Rather than a hairpin, the mature crRNA in type II remains attached to a fragment of the tracrRNA (FIG. 5). However, the RNA used in the invention does not have to be designed strictly to the design of naturally occurring crRNA, whether in length, regions or specific RNA sequences. What is clear though, is that RNA molecules for use in the invention may be designed based on gene sequence information in the public databases or newly discovered, and then made artificially, e.g. by chemical synthesis in whole or in part. The RNA molecules of the invention may also be designed and produced by way of expression in genetically modified cells or cell free expression systems and this option may include synthesis of some or all of the RNA sequence.",
                        "The structure and requirements of crRNA in type II (Cas9) has also been described in Jinek et al., 2012 ibid. In type I, there is a so-called \u201cSEED\u201d portion forming the 5\u2032 end of the spacer sequence and which is flanked 5\u2032 thereto by the 5\u2032 handle of 8 nucleotides. Semenova et al. (2011, PNAS 108: 10098-10103), have found that all residues of the SEED sequence should be complementary to the target sequence, although for the residue at position 6, a mismatch may be tolerated (FIG. 5). In type II, there is a SEED of 10-12 nucleotides that is located at the 3\u2032 end of the spacer (FIG. 5) (reviewed by Van der Oost 2014 ibid.). Similarly, when designing and making an RNA component of a ribonucleoprotein complex of the invention directed at a target locus (i.e. sequence), the necessary match and mismatch rules for the type II SEED sequence can be applied.",
                        "The invention therefore includes a method of detecting and/or locating a single base change in a target nucleic acid molecule comprising contacting a nucleic acid sample with a ribonucleoprotein complex of the invention as hereinbefore described, or with a Cas protein or polypeptide and separate targeting RNA component of the invention as hereinbefore described, and wherein the sequence of the targeting RNA (including when in the ribonucleoprotein complex) is such that it discriminates between a normal allele and a mutant allele by virtue of a single base change at, for example, position 6 of a contiguous sequence of 8 nucleotide residues.",
                        "Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, a design rule which may be used in preparing a targeting RNA component of ribonucleoprotein complexes of the invention involves the so-called \u201cPAM\u201d (protospacer adjacent motif) sequence in a double stranded target polynucleotide. In the type I-E system of E. coli, the PAM sequence may be a conserved triplet of nucleotide residues, such as 5\u2032-CTT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CAT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CCT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CAC-3\u2032, 5\u2032-TTT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-ATT-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-AWG-3\u2032, wherein W is A, T or U. In Type I, a PAM sequence located in the targeted strand is usually at a position corresponding to 5\u2032 of the SEED. In Type II, however, the PAM is located at the other end, on the displaced, or non-target, strand close to the 3\u2032 end of the crRNA spacer, at a position corresponding to 3\u2032 of the seed (FIG. 5) (Jinek et al., 2012, op. cit.). For Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, the PAM sequence has a conserved pair of nucleotide residues, 5\u2032-NGG-3\u2032. Recently, different Cas9 variants (Type IIA and Type IIC) (Ran et al., 2015 Nature 520:186-191)\u2014FIG. 1A) have been characterized, and PAMs have been revealed (see Ran et al., 2015, ibid. \u2014FIG. 10). Currently established Cas9 PAMs include: Type IIA 5\u2032-NGGNNNN-3\u2032 (Streptococcus pyogenes), 5\u2032-NNGTNNN-3\u2032 (Streptococcus pasteurianus), 5\u2032-NNGGAAN-3\u2032 (Streptococcus thermophilus), 5\u2032-NNGGGNN-3\u2032 (Staphylococcus aureus), and Type IIC 5\u2032-NGGNNNN-3\u2032 (Corynebacterium difteriae), 5\u2032-NNGGGTN-3\u2032 (Campylobacter lari), 5\u2032-NNNCATN-3\u2032 (Parvobaculum lavamentivorans), 5\u2032-NNNNGTA-3\u2032 (Neiseria cinerea). Cas9 of Geobacillus thermodenitrificans T12 (this invention) belongs to Type IIC (Ran et al., 2015, ibid.). The inventors have surprisingly found that the choice of PAM sequences for use with the invention can influence the temperature(s) at which the Cas proteins and polypeptides of the invention will interact with a target sequence. In particular, the inventors have found a preference for an 8-mer PAM sequence to confer activity across a broad temperature range, with a cytosine in the 5th position after the 3\u2032 end of the target sequence, and/or an adenine in the 8th position. There is also a preference for cytosine in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and/or 6th position of the PAM sequence after the 3\u2032 end of the protospacer sequence.",
                        "In particular aspects, interaction with a target sequence within a broad temperature range of, for example 20\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C., 30 to 80\u00b0 C., 20\u00b0 C. to 70\u00b0 C. or 25\u00b0 C. to 65\u00b0 C. may be achieved by utilizing a PAM sequence of 5\u2032-NNNNCVAA-3\u2032 [SEQ ID NO: 48].

In contrast to the 25-44\u00b0 C. range of its mesophilic orthologue SpCas9, ThermoCas9 of the present invention is active in vitro in a much broader temperature range of 20-70\u00b0 C. The extended activity and stability of ThermoCas9 allows for its application in molecular biology techniques that require DNA manipulation at temperatures of 20-70\u00b0 C., as well as its exploitation in harsh environments that require robust enzymatic activity. ThermoCas9 may also therefore be used as a genome editing tool for both thermophilic and mesophilic organisms.",

However, until now little was known about the molecular determinants of Cas9 activity at particular temperatures.",

As such, the PAM sequence may be altered to obtain the most efficient binding, cleavage, marking or modification of the target at a given temperature. This provides a great deal of flexibility in application of the ThermoCas9, depending on the particular application.

Biol. 4, 1217-1225; Jinek, M. et al., 2012, Science 337, 816-821; Xu, T. et al., 2015, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 81, 4423-4431). Based on sequence homology (FIG. 3), these residues can be D8 (D17 in FIG. 3) and D581 or H582 (FIG. 3) in gtCas9.",
                                "Preferably, the mutations D8A and H582A in gtCas9 (ThermoCas9) can be used to create a catalytically inactive, or \u201cdead\u201d Cas protein or polypeptide variant of ThermoCas9 (dCas) which lacks nuclease activity. Such a dCas may usefully find application as, for example, an efficient thermoactive transcriptional silencing CRISPRi tool, being able to steadily and specifically bind to DNA elements without introducing dsDNA breaks. Advantageously, such a system could, amongst other things, greatly facilitate metabolic studies of thermophiles.",
                                "In a particularly preferred aspect, the present invention provides a Cas protein or a ribonucleoprotein complex, wherein the nuclease activity of the Cas protein is inactivated and the at least one functional moiety is a marker protein, for example GFP. In this way it may be possible to specifically target a nucleic acid sequence of interest and to visualize it using a marker which generates an optical signal. Suitable markers may include for example, a fluorescent reporter protein, e.g. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) or mCherry. Such a fluorescent reporter gene provides a suitable marker for visualisation of protein expression since its expression can be simply and directly assayed by fluorescence measurement. Alternatively, the reporter nucleic acid may encode a luminescent protein, such as a luciferase (e.g. firefly luciferase). Alternatively, the reporter gene may be a chromogenic enzyme which can be used to generate an optical signal, e.g. a chromogenic enzyme (such as beta-galactosidase (LacZ) or beta-glucuronidase (Gus)). Reporters used for measurement of expression may also be antigen peptide tags. Other reporters or markers are known in the art, and they may be used as appropriate.",
                                "Because the marker may be visualized, in certain embodiments where the target nucleic acid is RNA, specifically mRNA, it may be possible to quantify the transcriptional activity of a gene by detection and quantification of the optical signal provided by the marker, particularly where the optical signal generated by the marker is directly proportionate to the quantity of the expression product. Therefore in preferred embodiments of the invention, Cas proteins or ribonucleoproteins of the invention may be used to assay expression products of a gene of interest.",
                                "In one aspect, the gtCas9 described herein may be used in a homologous recombination (HR) mediated genome modification method in microbial cells. Such methods involve HR and site-directed gtCas9 activity, whereby counter selection occurs by the gtCas9 activity removing microbes which do not have a desired modification introduced by HR.",
                                "Thus the methods and uses provided herein allow the process of homologous recombination to be favoured during a first step such that the microbial genome can be modified with the desired mutation and a second step in which unmodified cells can be targeted by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex to introduce a DSDB into the genomes of the unmodified cells. Due to an absence of an efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism in the majority of microbes, DSDB typically leads to cell death. Thus, these methods and uses increase overall the population of microbial cells with the desired mutation whilst eliminating any unmodified microbial cells. Preferably, such methods and uses are used in microbes that have substantially no endogenous NHEJ repair mechanism. Alternatively, the methods and uses may be applied to microbes that have an endogenous NHEJ repair mechanism. The methods and uses described herein may be applied to microbes that have an endogenous NHEJ repair mechanism but wherein the NHEJ repair mechanism is either conditionally reduced or the NHEJ activity is knocked out.",
                                "The methods and uses provided herein may utilise a sequence of the homologous recombination polynucleotide that has at least one mis-match with the guide RNA, such that the guide RNA is no longer able to recognise the modified genome. This means that the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex will not recognise the modified genome. Therefore, no DSDB can be introduced by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex and so the modified cells will survive. However, the cells with unmodified genomes will still have substantial complementarity to the guide RNA and consequently can be cleaved site-specifically by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex.",
                                "In another aspect of the methods and uses of the invention, the way in which the gtCas9 ribonucleoase complex is prevented from acting to cleave the microbial genome is not so much to modify or eliminate the sequence targeted by the guide, but rather the PAM required by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex. The PAM is either modified or eliminated in order to blind the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex to the specific cutting site. Therefore, methods and uses of the invention may include those using a sequence of the homologous recombination polynucleotide that does not include a PAM sequence recognised by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex. Therefore, no DSDB can be introduced by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex and so the HR modified cells will survive. However, the unmodified cells will still be recognised by the gtCas9 ribonuclease complex and its guide and so consequently are cleaved site-specifically.",
                                "Thus methods and uses are provided herein that rely on HR to modify the genome of the microbe. Preferably, the upstream flank and downstream flanks are 0.5 kilobases (kb) to 1.0 kb each in length. However, recombination using larger or shorter fragments is possible as well. The homologous recombination polynucleotide may further comprise a polynucleotide sequence between the upstream and downstream flanking regions. This polynucleotide sequence could for example contain a modification that is to be introduced into the microbial genome.",
                                "Whilst homologous recombination relies upon the upstream and downstream flanks having substantial complementarity to the target regions, mismatches can be accommodated as well. Therefore, in some embodiments, homologous recombination is known to occur between DNA segments with extensive homology to the upstream and downstream flanks. In alternative embodiments, the upstream and downstream flanks have complete complementarity to the target regions. The upstream and downstream flanks need not be identical in size. However, in some instances the upstream and downstream flanks are identical in size. The efficiency of homologous recombination will vary depending on the likelihood of homologous recombination of the smallest fragment length of the flank. However, even if the homologous recombination process is inefficient, advantageously the method described herein will select for any microbial cell that has the desired modification over the unmodified microbial cell. Homologous recombination also allows large deletions (e.g. 50 kb or more) to be made encompassing complete gene clusters. Homologous recombination is also used for recombineering, which is a well-known method to allow for recombination over smaller fragments (45-100 nt). The methods and uses described herein can optionally further comprise at least another homologous recombination polynucleotide or a polynucleotide comprising a sequence encoding a homologous recombination polynucleotide having a sequence substantially complementary to a second target region containing the target in the microbial genome.",
                                "In preferred embodiments, the methods and uses described herein utilise a homologous recombination polynucleotide that is DNA. In some embodiments the DNA is single stranded.",

                                "HR in the methods and uses provided herein may be used to remove a polynucleotide sequence from the microbial genome. Alternatively, HR in the methods and uses provided herein may be used to insert one or more gene(s), or fragment(s) thereof, in to the microbial genome. As a further alternative, HR in the methods and uses provided herein may be used to modify or replace at least one nucleotide in the microbial genome. Consequently, the methods and uses provided herein may be used for any desired kind of genome modification.",
                                "Alternatively, the gtCas9 described herein may be used in a HR mediated genome modification method in microbial cells, whereby the gtCas9 activity introduces DSDB and can induce cellular HR in microbial cells, as has been shown for spCas9 (Jiang et al.

In some embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the Cas protein or ribonucleoprotein will be provided as part of a suitable expression vector. In certain embodiments an expression vector of the present invention (with or without nucleotide sequence encoding amino acid residues which on expression will be fused to a Cas protein) may further comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a targeting RNA molecule as hereinbefore defined. Consequently, such expression vectors can be used in an appropriate host to generate a ribonucleoprotein complex of the invention which can target a desired nucleotide sequence. Alternatively, nucleotide sequences encoding a targeting RNA molecule as hereinbefore defined may be provided in a separate expression vector or alternatively may be delivered to a target cell by other means.",

The regulatory sequences may be plant-, animal-, bacteria-, fungal- or virus derived, and preferably may be derived from the same organism as the host cell. Clearly, appropriate regulatory elements will vary according to the host cell of interest. For example, regulatory elements which facilitate high-level expression in prokaryotic host cells such as in E. coli may include the pLac, T7, P(Bla), P(Cat), P(Kat), trp or tac promoters. Regulatory elements which facilitate high-level expression in eukaryotic host cells might include the AOX1 or GAL1 promoter in yeast or the CMV- or SV40-promoters, CMV-enhancer, SV40-enhancer, Herpes simplex virus VIP16 transcriptional activator or inclusion of a globin intron in animal cells.

Preferably, the promoter is inducible, to direct expression in response to environmental, chemical or developmental cues, such as temperature, light, chemicals, drought, and other stimuli. Suitably, promoters may be chosen which allow expression of the protein of interest at particular developmental stages or in response to extra- or intra-cellular conditions, signals or externally applied stimuli. For example, a range of promoters exist for use in E. coli which give high-level expression at particular stages of growth (e.g. osmY stationary phase promoter) or in response to particular stimuli (e.g. HtpG Heat Shock Promoter).",

Small crRNA molecules, which consist of a \u201cspacer\u201d (target) linked to a repetition region, are the transcription and processing products of a CRISPR loci. \u201cSpacers\u201d naturally originate from the genome of bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements, but they can also be designed to target a specific nucleotide sequence during a genetic engineering process (Bikard et al., 2013, Nucleic Acids Research 41: 7429-7437). The crRNA molecules are employed by the Cas9 as guides for the identification of their DNA targets. The spacer region is identical to the targeted for cleavage DNA region, the \u201cprotospacer\u201d (Brouns et al., 2012, Science 337: 808-809). A PAM (Protospacer Adjacent Motif), next to the protospacer, is required for the recognition of the target by the Cas9 (Jinek et al., 2012, Science 337: 816-821).",
                                "In order to perform in vitro or in vivo PAM-determination studies for Type II systems, it is necessary to in silico predict the CRISPR array of the system, the tracrRNA-expressing module. The CRISPR array is used for the identification of the crRNA module. The tracrRNA-expressing sequence is located either within a 500 bp-window flanking Cas9 or between the Cas genes and the CRISPR locus (Chylinski, K., et al. (2014) Classification and evolution of type II CRISPR-Cas systems. Nucleic Acids Res. 42, 6091-6105). The tracrRNA should consist of a 5\u2032-sequence with high level of complementarity to the direct repeats of the CRISPR array, followed by a predicted structure of no less than two stem-loop structures and a Rho-independent transcriptional termination signal (Ran, F. A., et al. (2015) In vivo genome editing using Staphylococcus aureus Cas9. Nature 520, 186-191). The crRNA and tracrRNA molecule can then be used to design a chimeric sgRNA module. The 5\u2032-end of the sgRNA consists of a truncated 20 nt long spacer followed by the 16-20 nt long truncated repeat of the CRISPR array. The repeat is followed by the corresponding truncated anti-repeat and the stem loop of the tracrRNA module. The repeat and anti-repeat parts of the sgRNA are generally connected by a GAAA linker (Karvelis, T., et al. (2015) Rapid characterization of CRISPR-Cas9 protospacer adjacent motif sequence elements. Genome Biol. 16, 253).",

The cas2 gene is followed by a 100 bp long DNA fragment which upon transcription forms an RNA structure with multiple loops. This structure obviously acts as a transcriptional terminator.",
                                "A CRISPR array with 11 repeats and 10 spacer sequences is located upstream of the transcriptional termination sequence and the leader of the array is located at the 5\u2032 end of the array. The DNA locus which is transcribed into the tracrRNA is expected to be downstream of the cas9 gene. The alignment of the 325 bp long sequence right downstream of the cas9 gene with the 36 bp long repeat from the CRISPR array revealed that there is a 36 bp long sequence in the tracrRNA locus almost identical to the repeat (shown in FIG. 6). This result led us to the conclusion that the direction of the transcription of the tracrRNA locus should be opposite to the direction of the transcription of the CRISPR array. Consequently the 5\u2032-end of the tracrRNA will be complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the crRNA, leading to the formation of the\u2014required by the Cas9-dual-RNA molecule."

DSDBs in a bacterial genome typically results in cell death. Therefore, a sgRNA that recognises a sequence in the WT pyrF could result in DSDB and death of cells containing the WT pyrF only. Introduction of DSDB is also dependent on a suitable PAM sequence being located downstream at the 3\u2032 end of the protospacer that is recognised by gtCas9.",

The constructs are herein referred to as constructs 1, 2 and 3 respectively.",

                                "Geobacillus thermodenitrificans strain T12, a Gram positive, moderately thermophilic bacterium with an optimal growth temperature at 65\u00b0 C. (Daas et al. Biotechnol. Biofuels 9, 210 (2016)) was isolated and sequenced. Contrary to previous claims that type II CRISPR-Cas systems are not present in thermophilic bacteria (Li et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 44, e34-e34 (2016)), the sequencing results revealed the existence of a type-IIC CRISPR-Cas system in the genome of G. thermodenitrificans T12 (FIG. 15A). The Cas9 endonuclease of this system (ThermoCas9) was predicted to be relatively small (1082 amino acids) compared to other Cas9 orthologues, such as SpCas9 (1368 amino acids). The size difference is mostly due to a truncated REC lobe, as has been demonstrated for other small Cas9 orthologues (FIG. 19) (Ran et al. Nature 520, 186-191 (2015)). Furthermore, ThermoCas9 was expected to be active at least around the temperature optimum of G. thermodenitrificans T12 (Daas et al. Biotechnol. Biofuels 9, 210 (2016)). Using the ThermoCas9 sequence as query, BLAST-P searches were performed in the NCBI/non-redundant protein sequences dataset, and a number of highly identical Cas9 orthologues were found (87-99% identity at protein level, Table 1), mostly within the Geobacillus genus, supporting the idea that ThermoCas9 is part of a highly conserved defense system of thermophilic bacteria (FIG. 15B). These characteristics suggested it may be a potential candidate for exploitation as a genome editing and silencing tool for thermophilic microorganisms, and for conditions at which enhanced protein robustness is required.",
                                "In silico prediction of the crRNA and tracrRNA modules of the G. thermodenitrificans T12 CRISPR-Cas system was performed using a previously described approach (Mougiakos et al. Trends Biotechnol. 34, 575-587 (2016); Ran et al. Nature 520, 186-191 (2015)). Based on this prediction, a 190 nt sgRNA chimera was designed by linking the predicted full size crRNA (30 nt long spacer followed by 36 nt long repeat) and tracrRNA (36 nt long anti-repeat followed by a 88 nt sequence with three predicted hairpin structures). ThermoCas9 was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Hypothesizing that the loading of the sgRNA to the ThermoCas9 would stabilize the protein, incubated purified apo-ThermoCas9 and ThermoCas9 loaded with in vitro transcribed sgRNA were incubated at 60\u00b0 C. and 65\u00b0 C., for 15 and 30 min. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the purified ThermoCas9 denatures at 65\u00b0 C. but not at 60\u00b0 C., while the denaturation temperature of ThermoCas9-sgRNA complex is above 65\u00b0 C. (FIG. 15C). The demonstrated thermostability of ThermoCas9 implied its potential as a thermo-tolerant CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tool, and encouraged us to analyze some relevant molecular features in more detail.",
                                "**Example 11: ThermoCas9 PAM Determination**",
                                "The first step towards the characterization of ThermoCas9 was the in silico prediction of its PAM preferences for successful cleavage of a DNA target. The 10 spacers of the G. thermodenitrificans T12 CRISPR locus were used to search for potential protospacers in viral and plasmid sequences using CRISPRtarget (Biswas et al. RNA Biol. 10, 817-827 (2013)). As only two hits were obtained with phage genomes (FIG. 20A), it was decided to proceed with an in vitro PAM determination approach. The predicted sgRNA sequence that contained a spacer for ThermoCas9-based targeting linear dsDNA substrates was transcribed with a matching protospacer. The protospacer was flanked at its 3\u2032-end by randomized 7-base pair (bp) sequences. After performing ThermoCas9-based cleavage assays at 55\u00b0 C., the cleaved members of the library (together with a non-targeted library sample as control) were deep-sequenced and compared in order to identify the ThermoCas9 PAM preference (FIG. 16A). The sequencing results revealed that ThermoCas9 introduces double stranded DNA breaks that, in analogy to mesophilic Cas9 variants, are located mostly between the 3rd and the 4th PAM proximal nucleotides. Moreover, the cleaved sequences revealed that ThermoCas9 recognizes a 5\u2032-NNNNCNR-3\u2032 PAM, with subtle preference for cytosine at the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th PAM positions (FIG. 16B). Recent studies have revealed the importance of the 81h PAM position for target recognition of certain Type IIC Cas9 orthologues (Karvelis et al. Genome Biol. 16, 253 (2015); Kim et al. Genome Res. 24, 1012-9 (2014)). For this purpose, and taking into account the results from the in silico ThermoCas9 PAM prediction, additional PAM determination assays were performed. This revealed optimal targeting efficiency in the presence of an adenine at the 8th PAM position (FIG. 16C). Interestingly, despite the limited number of hits, the aforementioned in silico PAM prediction (FIG. 20B) also suggested the significance of a cytosine at the 5th and an adenine at the 8th PAM positions.",
                                "To further clarify the ambiguity of the PAM at the 6th and 7th PAM positions, a set of 16 different target DNA fragments were generated in which the matching protospacer was flanked by 5\u2032-CCCCCNNA-3\u2032 [SEQ ID NO: 13] PAMs. Cleavage assays of these fragments (each with a unique combination of the 6th and 7th nucleotide) were performed in which the different components (ThermoCas9, sgRNA guide, dsDNA target) were pre-heated separately at different temperatures (20, 30, 37, 45, 55 and 60\u00b0 C.) for 10 min before combining and incubating them for 1 hour at the corresponding assay temperature. When the assays were performed at temperatures between 37\u00b0 C. and 60\u00b0 C., all the different DNA substrates were cleaved (FIG. 16D, FIG. 21). However, the most digested target fragments consisted of PAM sequences (5th to 8th PAM positions) 5\u2032-CNAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CMCA-3\u2032, whereas the least digested targets contained a 5\u2032-CAKA-3\u2032 PAM. At 30\u00b0 C., only cleavage of the DNA substrates with the optimal PAM sequences (5th to 8th PAM positions) 5\u2032-CNAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CMCA-3\u2032 was observed (FIG. 2D). Lastly, at 20\u00b0 C. only the DNA substrates with (5th to 8th PAM positions) 5\u2032-CVAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCCA PAM sequences were targeted (FIG. 21), making these sequences the most preferred PAMs. These findings demonstrate that at its lower temperature limit, ThermoCas9 only cleaves fragments with a preferred PAM. This characteristic could be exploited during in vivo editing processes, for e.g. to avoid off-target effects.",
                                "**Example 12: Thermostability and Truncations**",
                                "The predicted tracrRNA consists of the anti-repeat region followed by three hairpin structures (FIG. 17A). Using the tracrRNA along with the crRNA to form a sgRNA chimera resulted in successful guided cleavage of the DNA substrate. It was observed that a 41-nt long deletion of the spacer distal end of the full-length repeat-anti-repeat hairpin (FIG. 17A), most likely better resembling the dual guide's native state, had little to no effect on the DNA cleavage efficiency. The effect of further truncation of the predicted hairpins (FIG. 17A) on the cleavage efficiency of ThermoCas9 was evaluated by performing a cleavage time-series in which all the components (sgRNA, ThermoCas9, substrate DNA) were pre-heated separately at different temperatures (37-65\u00b0 C.) for 1, 2 and 5 min before combining and incubating them for 1 hour at various assay temperatures (37-65\u00b0 C.). The number of predicted stem-loops of the tracrRNA scaffold seemed to play a crucial role in DNA cleavage; when all three loops were present, the cleavage efficiency was the highest at all tested temperatures, whereas the efficiency decreased upon removal of the 3\u2032 hairpin (FIG. 17B). Moreover, the cleavage efficiency drastically dropped upon removal of both the middle and the 3\u2032 hairpins (FIG. 22). Whereas pre-heating ThermoCas9 at 65\u00b0 C. for 1 or 2 min resulted in detectable cleavage, the cleavage activity was abolished after 5 min incubation. The thermostability assay showed that sgRNA variants without the 3\u2032 stem-loop result in decreased stability of the ThermoCas9 protein at 65\u00b0 C., indicating that a full length tracrRNA is required for optimal ThermoCas9-based DNA cleavage at elevated temperatures. Additionally, we also varied the lengths of the spacer sequence (from 25 to 18 nt) and found that spacer lengths of 23, 21, 20 and 19 cleaved the targets with the highest efficiency. The cleavage efficiency drops significantly when a spacer of 18 nt is used.",
                                "In vivo, the ThermoCas9:sgRNA RNP complex is probably formed within minutes. Together with the above findings, the activity and thermostability of the RNP was evaluated. Pre-assembled RNP complex was heated at 60, 65 and 70\u00b0 C. for 5 and 10 min before adding pre-heated DNA and subsequent incubation for 1 hour at 60, 65 and 70\u00b0 C. Strikingly, the ThermoCas9 RNP was active up to 70\u00b0 C., in spite of its pre-heating for 5 min at 70\u00b0 C. (FIG. 17C). This finding confirmed our assumption that the ThermoCas9 stability strongly correlates with the association of an appropriate sgRNA guide (Ma et al., Mol. Cell 160, 398-407 (2015)). It would be advantageous in some applications for the ThermoCas9 to have a broad temperature activity range, that is, to be functional at both low and high temperatures. Also, in some circumstances, it would be advantageous if the activity of the ThermoCas9 could be restricted to narrower temperature ranges, for example, active at only low or only high temperatures. Consequently, the ability to manipulate the range of temperatures at which ThermoCas9 is capable of targeted cleavage or binding or at which targeted cleavage or binding takes place efficiently, by modifying structural features of ThermoCas9 or associated elements (such as the sgRNA), would enable a greater level of control to be exerted over nucleic acid sequence manipulation. Hence, we set out to compare the ThermoCas9 temperature range to that of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Both Cas9 homologues were subjected to in vitro activity assays between 20 and 65\u00b0 C. Both proteins were incubated for 5 min at the corresponding assay temperature prior to the addition of the sgRNA and the target DNA molecules. In agreement with previous analysis, the mesophilic SpCas9 was active only between 25 and 44\u00b0 C. (FIG. 17D); above these temperature SpCas9 activity rapidly decreased to undetectable levels. In contrast, ThermoCas9 cleavage activity could be detected between 25 and 65\u00b0 C. (FIG. 17D). This indicates the potential to use ThermoCas9 as a genome editing tool for both thermophilic and mesophilic organisms.",
                                "Previously characterized, mesophilic Cas9 endonucleases employ divalent cations to catalyze the generation of DSBs in target DNA (Jinek et al. Science 337, 816-821 (2012); Chen et al. J. Biol. Chem. 289, 13284-13294 (2014)). To evaluate which cations contribute to DNA cleavage by ThermoCas9, plasmid cleavage assays were performed in the presence of one of the following divalent cations: Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+; an assay with the cation-chelating agent EDTA was included as negative control. As expected, target dsDNA was cleaved in the presence of divalent cations and remained intact in the presence of EDTA (FIG. 23A). Based on reports that certain type-IIC systems were efficient single stranded DNA cutters (Ma et al. Mol. Cell 60, 398-407 (2015); Zhang et al. Mol. Cell 60, 242-255 (2015)), we tested the activity of ThermoCas9 on ssDNA substrates. However, no cleavage was observed, indicating that ThermoCas9 is a dsDNA nuclease (FIG. 23B).",

                                "ThermoCas9 is used as a genome editing tool for thermophilic bacteria. Here it is shown in Bacillus smithii ET 138 cultured at 55\u00b0 C. In order to use a minimum of genetic parts a single plasmid approach was used. A set of pNW33n-based pThermoCas9 plasmids was produced containing the thermocas9 gene under the control of the native xylL promoter (PxylL), also a homologous recombination template for repairing Cas9-induced double stranded DNA breaks within a gene of interest, and a sgRNA expressing module under control of the constitutive pta promoter (Ppta) from Bacillus coagulans (FIG. 4A).",
                                "The first goal was the deletion of the full length pyrF gene from the genome of B. smithii ET 138. The pNW33n-derived plasmids pThermoCas9_bs\u0394pyrF1 and pThermoCas9_bs\u0394pyrF2 were used for expression of different ThermoCas9 guides with spacers targeting different sites of the pyrF gene, while a third plasmid (pThermoCas9_ctrl) contained a random non-targeting spacer in the sgRNA expressing module. Transformation of B. smithii ET 138 competent cells at 55\u00b0 C. with the control plasmids pNW33n (no guide) and pThermoCas9_ ctrl resulted in the formation of \u02dc200 colonies each. Out of 10 screened pThermoCas9_ ctrl colonies, none contained the \u0394pyrF genotype, confirming findings from previous studies that homologous recombination in B. smithii ET 138 is not sufficient to obtain clean mutants (Mougiakos et al. ACS Synth. Biol. 6, 849-861 (2017); Bosma et al. Microb. Cell Fact. 14, 99 (2015)). In contrast, transformation with the pThermoCas9_bs\u0394pyrF1 and pThermoCas9_bs\u0394pyrF2 plasmids resulted in 20 and 0 colonies respectively, confirming the in vivo activity of ThermoCas9 at 55\u00b0 C. and verifying the above described broad in vitro temperature range of the protein. Out of ten pThermoCas9_\u0394pyrF1 colonies screened, one was a clean \u0394pyrF mutant whereas the rest had a mixed wild type/\u0394pyrF genotype (FIG. 4B), proving the applicability of the system, as the designed homology directed repair of the targeted pyrF gene was successful. Nonetheless, in the tightly controlled SpCas9-based counter-selection system we previously developed the pyrF deletion efficiency was higher (Olson et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 33, 130-141 (2015)). The low number of obtained transformants and clean mutants in the ThermoCas9-based tool can be explained by the low homologous recombination efficiency in B. smithii (Olson et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 33, 130-141 (2015)) combined with the constitutive expression of highly active ThermoCas9. It is anticipated that the use of a tightly controllable promoter will increase efficiencies.",

                                "To broaden the applicability of the ThermoCas9-based genome editing tool, and to evaluate whether in vitro results could be confirmed in vivo, its activity in the mesophilic Gram-negative bacterium P. putida KT2440 was evaluated by combining homologous recombination and ThermoCas9-based counter-selection. For this organism, a Cas9-based tool has not been reported to date. Once more, we followed a single plasmid approach. We constructed the pEMG-based pThermoCas9_pp\u0394pyrF plasmid containing the thermocas9 gene under the control of the 3-methylbenzoate-inducible Pm-promoter, a homologous recombination template for deletion of the pyrF gene and a sgRNA expressing module under the control of the constitutive P3 promoter. After transformation of P. putida KT2440 cells and PCR confirmation of plasmid integration, a colony was inoculated in selective liquid medium for overnight culturing at 37\u00b0 C. The overnight culture was used for inoculation of selective medium and ThermoCas9 expression was induced with 3-methylbenzoate. Subsequently, dilutions were plated on non-selective medium, supplemented with 3-methylbenzoate. For comparison, a parallel experiment without inducing ThermoCas9 expression with 3-methylbenzoate was performed. The process resulted in 76 colonies for the induced culture and 52 colonies for the non-induced control culture. For the induced culture, 38 colonies (50%) had a clean deletion genotype and 6 colonies had mixed wild-type/deletion genotype. On the contrary, only 1 colony (2%) of the non-induced culture had the deletion genotype and there were no colonies with mixed wild-type/deletion genotype retrieved (FIG. 24). These results show that ThermoCas9 can be used as an efficient counter-selection tool in the mesophile P. putida KT2440 when grown at 37\u00b0 C.",

For example, such a system would greatly facilitate metabolic studies of thermophiles. A catalytically dead variant of ThermoCas9 could serve this purpose by steadily binding to DNA elements without introducing dsDNA breaks. To this end, we identified the RuvC and HNH catalytic domains of ThermoCas9 and introduced the corresponding D8A and H582A mutations for creating a dead (d) ThermoCas9. After confirmation of the designed sequence, Thermo-dCas9 was heterologously produced, purified and used for an in vitro cleavage assay with the same DNA target as used in the aforementioned ThermoCas9 assays; no cleavage was observed confirming the catalytic inactivation of the nuclease.",
                                "Towards the development of a Thermo-dCas9-based CRISPRi tool, we aimed for the transcriptional silencing of the highly expressed ldhL gene from the genome of B. smithii ET138. We constructed the pNW33n-based vectors pThermoCas9i_ldhL and pThermoCas9i_ctrl. Both vectors contained the thermo-dCas9 gene under the control of PxylL promoter and a sgRNA expressing module under the control of the constitutive Pima promoter (FIG. 4C). The pThermoCas9i_ldhL plasmid contained a spacer for targeting the non-template DNA strand at the 5\u2032 end of the 138 ldhL gene in B. smithii ET 138 (FIG. S7). The position and targeted strand selection were based on previous studies (Bikard et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 41, 7429-7437 (2013); Larson et al. Nat. Protoc. 8, 2180-2196 (2013)), aiming for the efficient down-regulation of the ldhL gene. The pThermoCas9i_ctrl plasmid contained a random non-targeting spacer in the sgRNA-expressing module. The constructs were used to transform B. smithii ET 138 competent cells at 55\u00b0 C. followed by plating on LB2 agar plates, resulting in equal amounts of colonies. Two out of the approximately 700 colonies per construct were selected for culturing under microaerobic lactate-producing conditions for 24 hours, as described previously (Bosma et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 81, 1874-1883 (2015)). The growth of the pThermoCas9i_ldhL cultures was 50% less than the growth of the pThermoCas9i_ctrl cultures (FIG. 4E). We have previously shown that deletion of the ldhL gene leads to severe growth retardation in B. smithii ET 138 due to a lack of Ldh-based NAD+-regenerating capacity under micro-aerobic conditions (Bosma et al. Microb. Cell Fact. 14, 99 (2015)). Thus, the observed decrease in growth is likely caused by the transcriptional inhibition of the ldhL gene and subsequent redox imbalance due to loss of NAD+-regenerating capacity. Indeed, HPLC analysis revealed 40% reduction in lactate production of the ldhL silenced cultures, and RT-qPCR analysis showed that the transcription levels of the ldhL gene were significantly reduced in the pThermoCas9i_ldhL cultures compared to the pThermoCas9i_ctrl cultures (FIG. 4E).",

Rev. Microbiol. 13, 722-736 (2015); Weinberger et al., MBio 3, e00456-12 (2012)), a few of which have been used for genome editing of thermophiles (Li et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 44, e34-e34 (2016)). As a result, the application of CRISPR-Cas technologies was mainly restricted to temperatures below 42\u00b0 C., due to the mesophilic nature of the employed Cas-endonucleases. Hence, this has excluded application of these technologies in obligate thermophiles and in experimental approaches that require elevated temperatures and/or improved protein stability.",
                                "The inventors have characterized ThermoCas9, a Cas9 orthologue from the thermophilic bacterium G. thermodenitrificans T12, a strain that we previously isolated from compost (Daas et al., Biotechnol. Biofuels 9, 210 (2016)). Data mining revealed additional Cas9 orthologues in the genomes of other thermophiles, which were nearly identical to ThermoCas9, for the first time showing that CRISPR-Cas type II systems do exist in thermophiles, at least in some branches of the Bacillus and Geobacillus genera. The inventors have shown that ThermoCas9 is active in vitro in a wide temperature range of 20-70\u00b0 C., which is much broader than the 25-44\u00b0 C. range of its mesophilic orthologue SpCas9. The extended activity and stability of ThermoCas9 allows for its application in molecular biology techniques that require DNA manipulation at temperatures of 20-70\u00b0 C., as well as its exploitation in harsh environments that require robust enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the inventors have identified several factors that are important for conferring the thermostability of ThermoCas9. Firstly, the inventors have demonstrated that the PAM preferences of ThermoCas9 are very strict for activity in the lower part of the temperature range 30\u00b0 C.), whereas more variety in the PAM is allowed for activity at the moderate to optimal temperatures (37-60\u00b0 C.). Secondly, the inventors have demonstrated that ThermoCas9 activity and thermostability strongly depends on the association with an appropriate sgRNA guide. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the inventors hypothesise that this stabilization of the multi-domain Cas9 protein is most likely the result of a major conformational change from an open/flexible state to a rather compact state, as described for SpCas9 upon guide binding (Jinek et al. Science 343, 1247997-1247997 (2014)).",
                                "Based on the here described characterization of the novel ThermoCas9, the inventors have successfully developed genome engineering tools for strictly thermophilic prokaryotes. We showed that ThermoCas9 is active in vivo at 55\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. and we adapted the current Cas9-based engineering technologies for the thermophile B. smithii ET 138 and the mesophile P. putida KT2440. Due to the wide temperature range of ThermoCas9, it is anticipated that the simple, effective and single plasmid-based ThermoCas9 approach will be suitable for a wide range of thermophilic and mesophilic microorganisms that can grow at temperatures from 37\u00b0 C. up to 70\u00b0 C. This complements the existing mesophilic technologies, allowing their use for a large group of organisms for which these efficient tools were thus far unavailable.",
                                "Screening natural resources for novel enzymes with desired traits is unquestionably valuable. Previous studies have suggested that the adaptation of a mesophilic Cas9 orthologue to higher temperatures, with directed evolution and protein engineering, would be the best approach towards the construction of a thermophilic Cas9 protein. Instead, we identified a Glade of Cas9 in some thermophilic bacteria, and transformed one of these thermostable ThermoCas9 variants into a powerful genome engineering tool for both thermophilic and mesophilic organisms. With this study, we further stretched the potential of the Cas9-based genome editing technologies and open new possibilities for using Cas9 technologies in novel applications under harsh conditions or requiring activity over a wide temperature range.",
