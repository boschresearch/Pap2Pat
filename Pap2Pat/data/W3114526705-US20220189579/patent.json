                        "The determining factor for a protein's functionality is its structure, which is given by a sequence of amino acids and the sequence's three-dimensional arrangement. Consequently, researchers can draw conclusions about the behavior of the protein based on its molecular structure. This outcome can be useful in developing new vaccines and drugs, as viral fusion proteins play a central role in how the viruses invade the host's cells. In order to prevent infections, researchers attempt to develop vaccines and medicines that target these fusion proteins. This strategy is currently applied to find an effective vaccine for many viruses, including but not limited to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The structural information about the fusion proteins is useful for researchers to predict their behaviors and ultimately to find the right vaccine.",
                        "To determine the structure of a protein, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data may be used. Cryo-EM allows researchers to capture macromolecules' three-dimensional maps, which describe the density of electrons at a near-atomic resolution. The technology has gained popularity in recent years as an alternative to other structure determination methods, such as X-ray crystallography, due to its improved quality and efficiency. Amid the current global crisis related to SARS-CoV-2, it is significant that cryo-EM is being deployed right alongside X-ray crystallography to support the search for medicines and vaccines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                        "To derive the structure of a protein based on its 3D cryo-EM electron density map, researchers currently either have to manually fit the atoms or resort to existing template-based or homology modeling methods. The manual fitting of atoms represents an enormous manual effort as protein complexes usually consist of several thousand atoms, making it virtually impossible for larger structures. Therefore, there is a tremendous demand for a method that automatically determines the molecular structure from a cryo-EM density map. Unfortunately, existing tools such as Rosetta, MAINMAST, and Phenix determine only fragments of a protein complex, or require extensive manual processing steps. Due to the ability of cryo-EM to capture multiple large proteins in the course of a single study, a fully automated, efficient tool to determine complex structures would increase the throughput of the technology and speed up the development of medicines."

Thus, the output of the first neural network 204 has an atom type likelihood 212 output with four channels. The second neural network 206 is the backbone neural network, which determines a likelihood of whether each voxel is on the backbone, a part of a side chain, or not a part of the protein. Thus, the second neural network 206 has a backbone atom likelihood 214 output with three output channels. The third neural network 208 is the secondary structure neural network, which determines a likelihood of a specific secondary structure contained in each voxel. The secondary structure likelihood 216 output by the third neural network 208 has one output channel each for loops, sheets, helices, and no structure (i.e., four output channels). The fourth neural network 210 is the amino acid type neural network, which determines a likelihood of whether each amino acid type is present for each voxel. As 20 different types of amino acids have been found in nature, the amino acid type likelihood 218 output by the fourth neural network 210 has 21 output channels, representing the amino acids plus the case in which the voxel is not part of the protein.",

Neural networks that use the U-Net architecture excel in fast and precise image segmentation tasks, particularly for biomedical applications. For embodiments of the present disclosure, traditional two-dimensional U-Net architectures have been modified to process the three-dimensional density maps used herein.",

However, for the architecture to learn common noise patterns in cryo-EM density maps, it may be beneficial to use experimental density maps. In one test performed on an embodiment of the present disclosure, experimental maps were downloaded from the EM-DataResource website. Corresponding deposited model structures were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Bank and were used as ground truth data for training. To optimize the neural networks for high resolution maps, density maps with a resolution of 4 \u212b or better were used.",
                        "In one test embodiment, 1,800 experimental density maps and their corresponding deposited models structures were used as training data.

To label each density map, masks were created with the same dimensions as the grid of the density map, and labels were provided for each voxel based on the deposited model structures of each density map.",
                        "Separate masks were created for each of the four neural networks illustrated in FIG. 2. To train the first neural network 204 to generate atom type likelihood 212 values, an atoms mask was created that provides a label for each voxel indicating whether or not it contains a C\u03b1, C, or N atom. To create the atoms mask, these atoms were filtered out of the corresponding model structure, corresponding grid indices for their locations were determined, and the values in the corresponding voxel and all directly neighboring voxels were set to the value representing the atom (e.g., 1 for C\u03b1, 2 for C, and 3 for N).",
                        "Similar techniques were used to create the backbone mask, the secondary structure mask, and the amino acid mask. For the backbone mask, all backbone atoms and side-chain atoms were identified in the corresponding model structure, and the respective voxels within a distance of 2 from the identified atoms were set to 1 for backbone atoms and 2 for side-chain atoms. For the secondary structure mask, all atoms in the model structure that were part of helices, sheets, or loops were identified, and the respective voxels within a distance of 4 surrounding the atoms were set to 1 for loops, 2 for helices, and 3 for sheets. For the amino acid type mask, all C\u03b1 atoms for each of the 20 amino acid types were identified, and surrounding voxels within a distance of 3 were set to a value between 1 and 20 corresponding to the specific amino acid type.",

Identifying backbone structure prior to any atom prediction provides several advantages. For example, performance of the backbone structure identification is improved because each chain of alpha atoms will have a smaller number of atoms to be connected via an optimization technique. As another example, using these techniques decreases the number of incorrect connections between atoms of separate chains, because they are processed independently. Any suitable subroutine for determining a backbone structure of at least one disconnected chain of alpha atoms may be used. One non-limiting example of a suitable subroutine is illustrated in FIG. 4 and described in detail below.",
                        "At block 116, the computing system maps the amino acid sequences to the backbone structure by using an alignment technique that uses a reward function and a gap penalty. As discussed above, an output of the fourth neural network 210 is a prediction of amino acid type likelihoods 218. However, depending on the resolution of the density map, the amino acid type likelihoods 218 generated by the fourth neural network 210 may be of limited accuracy of around 10% to 50%, since some amino acids have a similar appearance in electron density maps. Accordingly, a goal of the actions at block 116 is to improve the amino acid type identification accuracy by aligning intervals of the initially predicted sequence indicated by the amino acid type likelihood 218 to the known amino acid sequences, and then updating the types of the predicted amino acids accordingly. Further illustration and discussion of the mapping of the amino acid sequences is provided below in association with FIG. 5.",
                        "After block 116, the determined residues on the backbone structure are limited to the C\u03b1 atoms. A complete protein backbone structure also includes carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. Accordingly, at subroutine block 118, the computing system determines locations of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms within the backbone structure based at least on the output of the first neural network. Any suitable subroutine for determining the locations of the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms may be used, including but not limited to the subroutine illustrated in FIG. 6 and discussed in further detail below.",

Any suitable technique for determining the side-chain atoms may be used. One non-limiting example embodiment of such a technique is to use the SCWRL4 tool developed by the Dunbrack lab, which predicts side-chain atoms for structures that have a complete backbone structure and amino acid types specified. In some embodiments, this tool may perform a collision detection to ensure that side-chains of different residues do not overlap.",

Accordingly, at block 122, the computing system stores the completed molecular structure in a computer-readable storage medium. The completed molecular structure may be used for any purpose, including but not limited to drug discovery. The method 100 then proceeds to an end block and terminates.",
                        "FIG. 4 is a flowchart that illustrates a non-limiting example embodiment of a procedure for determining a backbone structure based on voxel data according to various aspects of the present disclosure. The procedure 400 is a non-limiting example of a procedure suitable for use at subroutine block 114 of FIG. 1B. In the procedure 400, the output of the second neural network 206 is used to create an initial model structure that includes C\u03b1 atoms connected into one or more chains. The accuracy of the procedure 400 determines to a great extent how accurately the molecular structure will be determined. From a start block, the procedure 400 advances to block 402, where the computing system rounds likelihoods output by the second neural network 206 that a backbone atom is associated with each voxel to zero or one. In some embodiments, the output of the second neural network 206 for each voxel is a real value from zero to one for the likelihood that the voxel contains a C\u03b1 atom. In some embodiments, block 402 may round values for voxels that are greater than a threshold value, such as 0.5, up to one, and may round values for voxels that are less than the threshold value down to zero. In some embodiments, other threshold values may be used, including but not limited to 0.4 or 0.6.",

                        "The procedure 400 then advances to a for-loop defined between for-loop start block 408 and for-loop end block 414, wherein each disconnected chain of alpha atoms is processed separately to determine a portion of the backbone structure. By identifying disconnected chains of alpha atoms, the number of alpha atoms that have to be processed during each iteration of the for-loop is greatly reduced.",
                        "From the for-loop start block 408, the procedure 400 advances to block 410, where the computing system determines a point in space for each alpha atom of the disconnected chain of alpha atoms to create a point cloud. To find the x, y, and z coordinates of each alpha atom, the procedure 400 uses the real values generated by the second neural network 206. In some embodiments, the points in space may be determined using two steps: first, indices of all local maximums in the output of the second neural network 206 within a distance of 4 voxels that have a minimum value greater than a confidence threshold (e.g., 0.5) are determined. Second, the indices are refined by calculating a center of mass of all voxels within a distance of 4 surrounding the local maximums. The centers of mass may then be used as the points in space for the alpha atoms. This refinement may be made possible by using the real-valued outputs of the second neural network 206. The group of the points in space define a point cloud for the disconnected chain of alpha atoms.",
                        "At block 412, the computing system conducts an optimization on the point cloud to determine a backbone structure for the disconnected chain of alpha atoms. The factorial growth of the number of ways in which the atoms can be connected makes it infeasible to test all possible solutions even for a low number of atoms. Therefore, an optimization algorithm may be used. In some embodiments, a modified traveling salesman algorithm may be used. The modified traveling salesman algorithm may not match every criterion of the traveling salesman problem\u2014the shortest possible path is not necessarily the correct one, as the ideal distance between C\u03b1 is 3.8 \u212b. Deviations from this value are, however, possible due to prediction inaccuracies. Additionally, it is often difficult to decide only based on the distance which atoms to connect if there are multiple possibilities with a similar distance.",
                        "To address these issues, some embodiments of the present disclosure use a traveling salesman algorithm with a custom confidence function instead of solely relying on the Euclidean distance between atoms. The confidence function returns a score between 0 and 1 which indicates a confidence that two given atoms are connected in a backbone structure. The goal of the optimization is then to find connections for the disconnected chain of alpha atoms such that the sum of all confidence scores between connected atoms is maximized.",
                        "In some embodiments, the confidence function considers two factors: the Euclidean distance between the atoms, and the average density values of voxels that lay in between the atoms on the backbone confidence map predicted by the second neural network 206. The latter factor helps ensure that connections are made along the backbone of the structure. The voxels that lay between the atoms may be found using Bresenham's algorithm. To transform these metric values to a confidence score, a probability density function p(\u03c7, \u03bc, \u03c3) with a mean \u03bc that represents the ideal metric value and a standard deviation \u03c3 may be used. The function may be normalized by dividing it by the probability density value at the mean to ensure that the function returns exactly 1 at the mean. For the Euclidean distance, a mean of 3.8 and a standard deviation of 1 may be used in some embodiments. For the average backbone confidence, a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.3 may be used. These standard deviations were determined based on several rounds of testing, though in other embodiments, other values may be used for the standard deviations and means. Any suitable technique may be used to combine the two values into a single confidence score, including but not limited to simply multiplying the values together.",
                        "Since implementations of the traveling salesman algorithm are designed to minimize distances between paths, the confidence scores may be subtracted from 1 before being provided to the optimization algorithm. Further, implementations of the traveling salesman algorithm typically specify a start/end point. However, the procedure 400 does not know at which atom the disconnected chain of alpha atoms will start and/or end. Accordingly, a new atom may be added that is connected to every other atom with a confidence of 1. This atom may then be specified as the start/end, and may be removed from the actual chain of alpha atoms after the optimization is complete.",
                        "The procedure 400 then proceeds to for-loop end block 414. If any further disconnected chains of alpha atoms remain to be processed, then the procedure 400 returns to for-loop start block 408 to process the next disconnected chain of alpha atoms. Otherwise, if all of the disconnected chains of alpha atoms have been processed, then the procedure 400 advances to block 416.",
                        "At block 416, the computing system provides the backbone structures of the disconnected chains of alpha atoms as an overall backbone structure for the molecular structure. The procedure 400 then advances to an end block and terminates.",
                        "FIG. 5 includes charts that illustrate aspects of a non-limiting example embodiment of an alignment technique according to various aspects of the present disclosure. As discussed above at block 116, the prediction of amino acid types in the molecular structure can be improved by aligning the predicted amino acids to the known amino acid sequences of the molecule as obtained using sequencing techniques. Aligning amino acid sequences is a common problem in the field of bioinformatics, and previous research has led to the development of multiple alignment algorithms. However, previous alignment techniques are usually applied between different proteins to measure their sequence similarities, which does not fit the use case of the present disclosure. One drawback of the previous techniques is that they typically treat all matches and mismatches in the same way, whereas embodiments of the present disclosure would be improved by treating some matches and mismatches in different ways. This stems from the fact that some amino acid types have a more similar appearance in density maps than others, which leads to some mismatches of the fourth neural network 210 being more likely than others.",
                        "To analyze the relative frequency of a certain match of predicted and true amino acid types, the fourth neural network 210 was applied to 200 different density maps, and the predicted amino acid types were compared to the actual types from the deposited model structures. The chart in the lower left of FIG. 5 is a confusion matrix formatted as a heat map that shows the comparison of the actual amino acid types with the predicted amino acid types, with darker colors indicating higher numbers of matches. As expected, the most frequent matches are those of the same predicted and true amino acid types. However, one can also see that the fourth neural network 210 often confuses some types (e.g., ALA and SER) and struggles more with other types (e.g., CYS).",
                        "To incorporate the fourth neural network 210 prediction behavior into the alignment technique, a reward function r is defined which returns a score denoting how valuable a certain match of predicted type p and true type t is.

In some embodiments, a different constant may be used as the multiplier, including but not limited to other constants in the range of 90 to 110. The 0.05 constant was chosen because it represents the likelihood of a correct match if the amino acid type is chosen randomly, since there are 20 different amino acid types considered by the technique. The score is zero if the relative frequency equals this random likelihood.",
                        "In addition to the match reward described above, the alignment technique also uses a gap penalty. A gap represents a skipped amino acid in either the predicted or true sequence. This penalty, however, cannot simply be a static value because not all gaps are the same. For example, gaps in the beginning of a sequence before any matches were made should not result in any penalties as we only match short intervals of the predicted sequence, meaning it is highly unlikely that they align at the first amino acid of the true sequence. Additionally, the number of consecutive gaps is important. Cases where embodiments of the present disclosure miss an amino acid or predicts an extra amino acid appear relatively frequently, meaning that a single gap is not unlikely. However, two missed amino acids in a row is very uncommon, and three gaps in a row virtually never happens. Therefore, the penalty function p may be defined as below. The constants 20 and 30 were chosen for c3 and c4, respectively, based on test runs to create a good balance with the rewards function, but in some embodiments, other constants may be used, including but not limited to constants between 18 and 22 for the first value and constants between 27 and 33 for the second value.",

First, side chain atoms (which determine the amino acid type) are only visible in very high resolution maps, making it almost impossible to accurately predict the amino acid type for lower resolutions. Second, the amino acid type mapping of every segment can either be correct or incorrect. It means that either all amino acid types will be correct for this segment, or in case of an incorrect mapping, the amino acid types are entirely random. This amplifies the steep incline in accuracy for higher resolution maps.
