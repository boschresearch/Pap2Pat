    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most effective antigen presenting cells for the development of T cell responses. The only FDA approved DC-based immunotherapy to date is Sipuleucel-T, which utilizes a fusion protein to stimulate DCs ex vivo with GM-CSF and simultaneously deliver the antigen PAP for prostate cancer. This approach is restricted by the breadth of immunity elicited to a single antigen, and to cancers that have a defined tumor associated antigen. Other multi-antigen approaches have been restricted by poor efficacy of vaccine adjuvants. We have developed a vaccine platform that consists of autologous DCs pulsed with cytokine-adjuvanted tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) made from tumor tissue, that encapsulate the antigenic landscape of individual tumors. Here we test the efficacy of DCs pulsed with TMVs incorporated with glycolipid-anchored immunostimulatory molecules (GPI-ISMs) in HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer murine models. Pulsing of DCs with TMVs containing GPI-ISMs results in superior uptake of vesicles, DC activation and cytokine production. Adaptive transfer of TMV-pulsed DCs to tumor bearing mice results in the inhibition of tumor growth, reduction in lung metastasis, and an increase in immune cell infiltration into the tumors. These observations suggest that DCs pulsed with TMVs containing GPI-GM-CSF and GPI-IL-12 can be further developed to be used as a personalized immunotherapy platform for cancer treatment.",

                "Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy approaches have gained popularity for their ability to induce potent anti-tumor immune responses [1]. Currently, the only vaccination approach that is FDA approved for cancer is the DC-based vaccine Sipuleucel-T [2]. This DC-based vaccine relies on obtaining peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and stimulating ex vivo with a fusion protein consisting of GM-CSF and the tumor antigen prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). Sipuleucel-T has provided some survival advantage in prostate cancer patients [2]. Despite this success, the breadth of immunity induced by a single antigen approach is limited and not widely applicable to cancers without defined target antigens, such as triple negative breast cancer. Other DC vaccination approaches rely on the identification and production of patient specific neoantigens from peptides that are restricted to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I for presentation to CD8 T cells [3,4,5]. Delivery of mRNA encoding for tumor antigens and activating signals to DCs has also been reported with some success [6]. In one of the first-in-human testing of personalized RNA vaccines, individualized RNAs encoding poly-neo-epitopes were delivered to patients at the inguinal lymph nodes for DC uptake. Therapy with these personalized \u201cmutanome\u201d vaccines resulted in vaccine-induced T cell infiltration into tumors, reduced metastasis, and sustained progression-free survival [7]. However, these approaches remain resource-intensive [8]. GVAX is another notable approach that utilized irradiated tumor cells modified to express soluble GM-CSF to stimulate antigen presenting cells and induce an anti-tumor response [9]. However, the difficulty to regulate the amount of soluble GM-CSF secreted resulted in increased myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and impaired DC responses in patients [10]. Tumor lysates have also been tested as source of antigen for DC based vaccines in cancer. Oxidation of tumor tissue using hypochlorous acid was shown to increase the immunogenicity of the lysate. DCs generated from monocytes and pulsed with the autologous oxidized tumor lysate have been shown to induce robust anti-tumor effects in murine and human studies [11,12].",
                "We have developed a tumor membrane vesicle (TMV)-based vaccine immunotherapy approach that can be prepared from frozen tumor tissue. TMVs are 200\u2013600 nm in size, making them ideal for processing by antigen presenting cells [13,14], such as DCs and macrophages. To increase the immune response against the tumor antigens in the TMV, we have developed a novel \u201cprotein transfer\u201d approach that incorporates glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored immunostimulatory molecules (GPI-ISMs) onto the surface of TMVs. In previous studies we have utilized TMVs incorporated with GPI-B7-1 and GPI-IL-12 to stimulate the anti-tumor response in preclinical models of breast cancer [15,16], thymoma [17], and head-and-neck cancers [18]. While these approaches are promising when the tumor tissue is available in sufficient quantity, it is difficult to generate sufficient TMV vaccine for the cancers where the tissue is limited in quantity, such as inoperable tumors or metastatic recurrent cases where the archived primary tumor is no longer available at the time of recurrence where only a biopsy sample can be used. To overcome this caveat, developing a DC vaccine by delivering a lower dose of TMVs to antigen presenting cells ex vivo to enhance the TMV uptake, DC activation and anti-tumor immune response in a therapeutic setting will be a promising approach.",
                "In this study, we have developed a DC vaccine platform that utilizes autologous DCs pulsed with cytokine-adjuvanted TMVs as a therapeutic in murine breast cancer models. We observed that DCs can take up TMVs when pulsed in vitro, and this uptake is improved when TMVs contain GPI-GM-CSF and GPI-IL-12 on their surface. TMVs containing GPI-GM-CSF and GPI-IL-12 can also improve DC activation as measured by surface CD86 and MHC-II expression as well as cytokine production. We also show that treatment with DCs pulsed ex vivo with HER-2+ TMV results in tumor growth inhibition and improved survival of tumor bearing mice. Further, in a triple negative breast cancer model which lacks a defined target antigen, the DC vaccine can also inhibit tumor growth, reduce lung metastasis and increase immune cell infiltration into the tumor."

In this approach, DCs are presented simultaneously with tumor antigens and adjuvants (GPI-ISMs) in a particulate form to enhance uptake of the vaccine and activation of DCs. We find that DCs pulsed with TMV vaccine had improved uptake, while GPI-GM-CSF on TMVs induced DC activation, and GPI-GM-CSF and GPI-IL-12 provided signaling to produce inflammatory cytokines. We also show that the TMV vaccine platform can be used in the metastatic 4T1 model, which lacks a defined tumor antigen, where vaccine pulsed DCs can result in the inhibition of tumor growth, reduction of lung metastatic burden, and increased tumor-infiltrating immune cells.",
                "The optimal delivery of antigens to DCs is one of the most important aspects in vaccine formulations. Particles that are within the 100 nm to 1 \u03bcm diameter have shown good immunogenicity and uptake by DCs [13,23,24]. TMVs are derived from plasma membrane of tumor cells and have an average diameter of 200 nm, falling within this range, and can retain the surface antigens that are present on tumor cells. However, antigen uptake is not the only important metric for vaccine immunotherapy. The activation of antigen presenting cells, especially DCs, is important for the initiation or enforcement of the T cell response against malignant cells. The cytokine GM-CSF has been known to induce DC maturation and activation [25,26]. One of the earliest iterations was in the form of GVAX [9], followed by Sipuleucel-T [27], Talimogene laherparevec (T-VEC) [28], and many other approaches [29]. These approaches rely on the delivery of GM-CSF ex vivo to patient PBMCs, or the generalized production of GM-CSF into the periphery in the case of GVAX or T-VEC. Using the TMVs, DCs are presented with antigen in a formulation that is easily internalized, and results in DC maturation and inflammatory cytokine production induced by the TMV-bound GM-CSF and IL-12. As with GM-CSF, IL-12 dosage and delivery is important for the tolerance and efficacy of treatment. Frequent systemic dosages of IL-12 have been found to be toxic in human studies, while a single dose two weeks before consecutive dosing dramatically reduced the toxicity in Phase 1 studies [30]. In order to decrease the toxicity in cancer patients undergoing IL-12 therapy, new approaches such as localized delivery of IL-12 intratumorally, or antibody-cytokine fusion proteins such as NHS-IL-12, are being tested in patients [31,32,33]. In a recent first-in-human phase 1 trial, an MTD of 16.8 \u03bcg/kg of NHS-IL-12 administered subcutaneously (s.c.) was reported in lung cancer patients resulting in increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T cell receptor diversity, although no objective tumor responses were observed [34]. Delivery of DCs pulsed ex vivo with TMVs containing GPI-IL-12 may greatly decrease the potential local and systemic toxicity of the cytokine, while promoting tumor specific T cell activation and differentiation. Further, the ex vivo pulsing of DCs with TMVs containing GPI-GM-CSF can limit the off-target immunosuppressive effects of GM-CSF on other myeloid cells, such as MDSCs, which can have a negative effect on the anti-tumor immune response [35].",
                "Immune cell infiltration into tumors is one of the biomarkers used to predict responses in patients, and a high infiltration of T cells is associated with decreased metastatic recurrence and increased survival in TNBC patients [36,37]. However, T cells are not the only important subset of immune cells that play a role in the tumor microenvironment. It has become clearer that the presence of antigen presenting cells, particularly DCs, can provide a niche for optimal T cell responses within tumors [38]. In this study we compare the T cell and DC infiltration within 4T1 tumors after treatment with the DC vaccine. The tumors from mice treated with the DC vaccine had a significant increase in the percentage of MHC-II+ CD11c+ DCs compared to PBS controls. Further, there was a significant increase in the percentage of tumor infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, treatment with the DC vaccine therapeutic approach results in a beneficial change in the immune profile of 4T1 tumors, however, more remains to be known about the specific mechanisms that govern the changes in DC and T cell infiltration. Overall, our studies serve as a proof of concept for the use of TMVs with GPI-ISMs as the source of antigen and adjuvants for the development of a therapeutic DC vaccine platform. Our studies show the potential for use in cancers where there is a defined tumor associated antigen, or in metastatic cancers that lack a defined antigen such as triple negative breast cancer."
