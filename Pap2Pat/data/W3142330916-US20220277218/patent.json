                        "Existing vision-linguistic (VL) models mainly focus on relatively coarse representations, while less attention has been paid to fine-grained representation learning for domain-specific tasks such as fashion-based tasks. A domain-specific transformer-based model can be pre-trained using a multi-modal approach for fine-grained representation learning tasks. The model and pre-training approach are applied to the fashion domain and trained on both fashion related images and associated descriptions. The model uses fine-grained image patches when generating image embeddings. When pre-training the model, image patches and relevant text tokens are aligned with each other and then an alignment guided masking approach is used to preferentially mask one of an image patch or text token that were aligned. Once pre-training is completed the model can be used in various applications, including for example retrieving images/products based on a text description.",
                        "Image-text pair models can be categorized into single stream, two-stream or even three-stream models according to the network architecture of the single-modal input. In single-stream models, the features of different modalities are directly fed into a Transformer. In contrast, in two-stream models, they are first processed by two single-modal networks before fed into a Transformer, and so forth in three-stream models. While single stream, two-stream and three-stream models may have associated advantages or disadvantages, single-stream models may provide more cross-modality information interactions.",
                        "The transformer-based model described further herein is a single-stream model based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) framework. The model focuses on a masking strategy at the embedding level rather than at the task level or input level. The current pre-training approach explicitly aligns the embedding features between image and text so that it can learn fine-grain representations for domain-specific tasks, such as fashion tasks. The pre-training of the model focuses on fine-grained representation learning and bridging the semantic gaps between text and image. To achieve this goal, a \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d patch strategy is developed for images, which extracts a kaleidoscope of multi-grained image patches for the image-modality. This strategy is scalable and largely alleviates the coarse presentation issue of generic models by introducing a patch-variant pre-training scheme. Furthermore, to bridge the semantic gap between different modalities, attention information is employed to build pre-alignments between kaleidoscope patches of the images and text tokens. This pre-alignment information further guides the masking strategy for pre-training the model. The pre-training forces the model to explicitly learn semantic information across modalities.",

Related pre-training tasks for the kaleidoscope patches cause the model to learn fine-grained cross-modality information. The kaleidoscope patch based training outperforms other fixed-patch vision-linguistic (VL) models in the fashion domain. A pre-alignment strategy is introduced to infer a cross-modality mapping between kaleidoscope patches and text tokens. The pre-alignment attempts to align image patches with related text tokens. These pre-alignment pairs largely fill the semantic gaps between modalities. The pre-training uses the pre-alignment pairs are then used in an alignment-guided strategy. The alignment-guided masking strategy explicitly forces the model to learn the semantic connections between vision and language, that is between the image modality and text modality.",

The system allows a user to enter search terms describing a desired product and returns product images based on the search terms. The interface 102 may include a search button 104 and text box 106 that allows a text string to be input and used to search for fashion related products. The interface 102 may be provided by one or more computers 108. The computer system 108 comprises a processor (CPU) 110 for executing instructions that may be stored in a memory unit 112. The computer system 108 may further include non-volatile (NV) storage 114 for storage of instructions and data. An input/output (I/O) interface 116 may allow additional components, such as mice, keyboards, displays, network interfaces, graphics processing units, etc., to be connected to the system 108.",

Alignment ranking functionality 124 may process text embeddings generated by text embedding functionality 126 using the cross modality transformer model 120 in order to rank collection data 122 to determine products/images that match the text embeddings. In use, the text embedding of the search text can be combined with different product image embeddings from the collection data 122 in order to determine or rank the product images that are best described by the search text.

                        "FIG. 2 depicts a method of training, or pre-training, a domain specific transformer-based model. The method 200 receives an input image and input text describing the input image (202). The input image may be an image of one or more fashion related products and the input text can describe the fashion related products. The input image is processed to generate image patches from the input image (204). The patches can be generated at differing levels of granularity so that the image or portion of the image is represented by a plurality of different patch groups. Each of the patch groups covers the same portion of the input image but with varying numbers of patches. For example, in the first level patch group the image may be covered by a single patch, while in the second level patch group the image may be covered by a 2\u00d72 grid of patches, and in the nth level patch group the image may be covered by an n\u00d7n grid of patches. The model described below uses 5 different levels for the kaleidoscope patches, with each level being covered by a grid of patches. Generating the kaleidoscope patches using the 5 level grid process results in 55 individual patches. In addition to generating the kaleidoscope patches from the input images, the method 200 also tokenizes the input text (206). The input text may be tokenized into words or subwords. For example, the text tokenization may use, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), Unigram, WordPiece, SentencePiece or other text tokenizers.",

As described in further detail below, the masking may preferentially mask one of a patch or text token from a patch/text pair that has been aligned. The masking may replace the image patch with a masked version of the patch or may replace a text token with a mask token or other text token. The image patches and tokens, including the masked patches/tokens are then used to generate a training embedding (210). The training embedding may be generated as a concatenation of embeddings of individual patches image patches and text tokens. The image and text embeddings may be generated using respective embedding functionality. The training embedding is then used to train the transformer-based model (212) by applying the model to the training embedding in order to predict the masked image patches/tokens. The prediction results compared to the actual image patches/text tokens that were masked are used to adjust the model in order to reduce the error between the predicted image patches/text tokens and the patches/tokens that were masked.",

An image patch may be aligned to a text token if the image patch is relevant to the text token. Not all text tokens may be aligned with an image patch. Although the alignment pairs may be generated in various ways, one approach is to use a separate model to automatically generate a text description of the image along with a mapping of areas in the image that were important in generating the respective text tokens. One or more of the automatically generated text tokens can be matched to corresponding tokens from the input text and the mapping of the relevant images can be used to align image patches to the text tokens.",

The individual masked image patches may replace the original image patches in various ways, although they are depicted as being replaced with a blank or black patch. Further, although depicted as replacing the actual image patches, the image patches may be provided by embeddings of the image patches. The masked text 324 may comprise the input text tokens with one or more of the text tokens replaced with a masking token, depicted as \u2018[MASK]\u2019 in FIG. 3 or other tokens, such as a blank token or random token. In addition to the input text tokens and masked text tokens, the masked text 324 may include a classification token, depicted as \u2018[CLS]\u2019 in FIG. 3. The classification token may be used to provide an indication of the relevance between the input text and the input image. The masked image patches 322 and masked text 324 are used to generate an image embedding 326 and text embedding 328 that can be concatenated together and provided to the cross-modality transformer 302. The embedding generated for each patch may comprise for example a feature vector having a fixed number of dimensions, such as 1024 or 2048 or other dimensions. Additional information may be included in the embeddings such as modality information indicative of whether the embedding is an image embedding or text embedding. Additionally, the information may provide an indication of the patch location for image patches, or the word position of tokens in the input text.",

At the embedding stage, an attention-based alignment generator (AAG) may be used to generate pre-alignments between text tokens and kaleidoscope image patches so that the image and text are explicitly aligned semantically. An Alignment Guided Masking (AGM) strategy may be used to relieve the difficulty of cross-modality modeling. The AGM strategy masks respective ones of image patches or text tokens from pre-alignment pairs. Text tokens and kaleidoscope image patches can fully interact in the pre-training system 300, which gradually learns VL semantic information and produces the cross-modality fine-grained representations. The text tokens and image patches are trained under different training tasks, including image-text matching that attempts to predict if the text describes the image, an aligned masked language modeling task that attempts to predict the masked out words based on the surrounding words and image patches, as well as aligned kaleidoscope patch modeling task that attempts to predict different image patches.",
                        "FIG. 4 depicts components of a patch generator for use in a training system as depicted in FIG. 3. As depicted, the patch generator 312 may receive an image 310a as input, which is passed to a saliency detection network 402, such as EGNet, that can identify the foreground 404 of the input image. With the foreground identified it can be used to lock, or provide a bounding box around, the relevant portion 406 of the input image. From the locked portion, patch generation functionality 408 generates a plurality of image patches 410. As depicted the image patches are generated in a number of different patch groups with each patch group covering the locked image with different numbers of patches. The patch generation splits the image into different scales (i.e., 1\u00d71, 2\u00d72, . . . , 5\u00d75), with the different scales of patches providing the \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d patches. More detailed divisions, such as 6\u00d76 or N\u00d7N may be used according to the difficulty of the specific task. In the case of 5 different scales of the image patches, and using 1\u00d71, 2\u00d72, 3\u00d73, 4\u00d74, and 5\u00d75 patch grids for each level 55 kaleidoscope patches are obtained from each input image. Once the image patches are generated, they may be used to generate the image embeddings of these patches, for example using a standard ResNet-50 412 as the embedding backbone. As depicted, the ResNet-50 can produce a 2048 dimension feature vector 414 for each of the 55 image patches.",

With the text tokens and image patches aligned they can be used in alignment guided masking of the image patches and text tokens.",
                        "The random masking strategy used by other VL BERT models is that the pre-aligned (token, patch) pair provides explicit semantic relations between the two modalities. This alignment can be used in the pre-training stage, which further forces the current transformer-based model to explicitly explore cross-modality semantic information. In contrast to the random masking strategy, Alignment Guided Masking (AGM) gives high priority to masking the pre-alignment pairs. Meanwhile, for each selected pre-aligned (token, patch) pair, either the token part or the patch part of the pre-alignment pair is randomly masked, which stimulates the model to learn the missing information in one modality using the information of the other. If all pre-alignment pairs are traversed and masked but not-enough tokens or patches have been masked, a random masking strategy is adopted to mask the unaligned tokens and patches independently. In this way, it is possible to obtain the token and patch masking candidates. The AGM strategy is not applied to all of the patch groups, since the masking of large patches, such as the 1\u00d71 patch groups or 2\u00d72 patch groups will increase the difficulty of the modelling. The AGM strategy may be applied to finer-grained patch groups such as the 3\u00d73 patch group, 4\u00d74 patch group and 5\u00d75 patch group. The AGM strategy may mask different numbers of image patches at each group level. For example one image patch may be masked for the level 3, or 3\u00d73, patch group, two image patches may be masked for the level 4, or 4\u00d74, patch group and three image patches may be masked for the level 5 or 5\u00d75, patch group.",
                        "For each image patch or text token selected for masking, the patch or token may be masked in different ways. For example, an image patch may be masked by replacing the patch's image feature vector with a blank image feature vector, the image feature vector of a grey-scale version of the image patch, or the image feature vector of the same patch location of a different image. For text tokens to be masked, the token may be replaced with a masking token such as \u2018[MASK]\u2019, and random token, or a blank token.",
                        "Once the image patches and text tokens have been masked, the image patches and tokens can be used to train the cross-modality transformer based model. Although the above has described that the masking strategy is not applied to the level 1 or level 2 group patches, these groups may nonetheless be modified for training. For example, the level one patch group, which is essentially the input image, may be rotated by one of a number of rotation angles such as 0, 90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees. The level 2 group patches may be modified by re-ordering the location of the image patches. The image patches and text tokens are processed by the cross-modality transformer model on a number of pre-training tasks.",
                        "The original BERT may be adopted as the cross-modality transformer so that the current model can be easily extended. Specifically, for the text side, the order of the text token generated via WordPieces or other tokenizers can encode the position as 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , N based on the position of the token in the input text. The final training corpus for each sub-word token is obtained by summing up its embedding with the segment, which is used to indicate that it is part of the text or image modalities, and position embeddings, followed by another layer normalization (LN) layer. For the image side, the position information for each patch may be generated by re-organizing it as 5D features ([x1, x2, y1, y2, w*h]) for each patch. After that, both patches and location features are fed into a fully-connected (FC) layer in order to project them into the same embedding space. The visual embeddings for each patch may be obtained by summing up three FC outputs, namely the FC (segment id), FC (image patch feature), FC (position embedding) and then passing them through a LN layer. The segment id provides an indication of whether the feature belongs to the image or text modality.",
