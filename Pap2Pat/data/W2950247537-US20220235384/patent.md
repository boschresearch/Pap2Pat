# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a nano-biohybrid (e.g., a nanoorg) organism (e.g. a bacteria) comprising different core-shell quantum dots (QDs) or gold nanoparticle clusters, with excitation ranges having ultraviolet to near-infrared energies, coupled with targeted enzyme sites. When illuminated by light, these nanorgs drive the renewable production of biofuel molecules and chemicals using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and nitrogen (from air) as substrates. The disclosed nanorgs catalyze light-induced air-water-CO2 reduction with a high turnover number (TON) of approximately 106-108 (mols of product per mol of cells) to biofuels including, but not limited to, isopropanol (IPA), butane diol, gasoline additives, gasoline substitutes, 2,3-butanediol (BDO), C11-C15 methyl ketones (MKs), and hydrogen (H2); and chemicals such as formic acid (FA), ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), and degradable bioplastics, e.g. polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). These nanoorg cells function as nano-microbial factories powered by light.

## BACKGROUND

Attempts were made to combine the desired functionality of direct light-activation in cell free extracts/purified enzymes (Reference No. 3) and whole non-photosynthetic bacteria (Reference No. 4), but these strategies have limited applicability due to either enzyme de-activation in the air, or specific tolerance of the bacteria to inorganic elements.

There has been intensive searches for new methods to combine multiple functionalities (e.g., light, voltage, or magnetic field stimulation) of inorganic nanomaterials with the versatility of designed synthetic metabolic networks in living cells, to simply “grow” such hybrid catalysts by the addition of inorganic nanomaterials to the media/buffered water, thereby combining specificity of biocatalysts with high-throughput of inorganic nanomaterials.

However, living cells do not interface naturally with nanoscale materials.

Because such artificial organisms are contemplated to have unprecedented multifunctional properties, such as wireless activation of enzyme function using electromagnetic stimuli, there is a need for new artificial organisms.

As used herein, the terms “nucleic acid molecule encoding”, “DNA sequence encoding,” and “DNA encoding” refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence.

As used herein, the term “structural gene” refers to a DNA sequence coding for RNA or a protein. In contrast, “regulatory genes” are structural genes that encode products which control the expression of other genes (e.g., transcription factors).

As used herein, the term “gene” means the deoxyribonucleotide sequences comprising the coding region of a structural gene and including sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5′ and 3′ ends for a distance of about 1 kb on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. The sequences which are located 5′ of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 5′ non-translated sequences. The sequences which are located 3′ or downstream of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as 3′ non-translated sequences. The term “gene” encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form or clone of a gene contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed “introns” or “intervening regions” or “intervening sequences.” Introns are segments of a gene which are transcribed into heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or “spliced out” from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide.

In addition to containing introns, genomic forms of a gene may also include sequences located on both the 5′ and 3′ end of the sequences that are present on the RNA transcript. These sequences are referred to as “flanking” sequences or regions (these flanking sequences are located 5′ or 3′ to the non-translated sequences present on the mRNA transcript). The 5′ flanking region may contain regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers which control or influence the transcription of the gene. The 3′ flanking region may contain sequences which direct the termination of transcription, posttranscriptional cleavage and polyadenylation.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a nano-biohybrid (e.g., a nanoorg) organism (e.g. a bacteria) comprising different core-shell quantum dots (QDs) or gold nanoparticle clusters, with excitation ranges having ultraviolet to near-infrared energies, coupled with targeted enzyme sites. When illuminated by light, these nanorgs drive the renewable production of biofuel molecules and chemicals using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and nitrogen (from air) as substrates. The disclosed nanorgs catalyze light-induced air-water-CO2 reduction with a high turnover number (TON) of approximately 106-108 (mols of product per mol of cells) to biofuels including, but not limited to, isopropanol (IPA), butane diol, gasoline additives, gasoline substitutes, 2,3-butanediol (BDO), C11-C15 methyl ketones (MKs), and hydrogen (H2); and chemicals such as formic acid (FA), ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), and degradable bioplastics, e.g. polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). These nanorg cells function as nano-microbial factories powered by light.

In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a nano-biohybrid organism (or nanorg) including, but not limited to: (1) chemical coupling via affinity binding and self-assembly, (2) the energetic coupling between optoelectronic states of artificial materials with a cellular process, and (3) the design of appropriate interfaces ensuring biocompatibility. Here it is shown that at least seven different core-shell quantum dots (QDs), with excitations ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared energies, coupled with targeted enzyme sites in bacteria. When illuminated by the appropriate light energy, these QDs drive the renewable production of biofuels and chemicals using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and nitrogen (e.g. from air) as substrates. These disclosed QDs, as described herein, use zinc-rich shell facets for affinity attachment to cellular proteins. Cysteine zwitterion ligands enable uptake through the cell wall, facilitating cell survival. Together, such compositions provide nanorgs catalyzing light-induced air-water-CO2 reduction with a high turnover number (TON) of approximately 106-108 (mols of product per mol of cells) to biofuels, such as isopropanol (IPA), 2,3-butanediol (BDO), C11-C15 methyl ketones (MKs), and hydrogen (H2); and chemicals such as formic acid (FA), ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), and degradable bioplastics such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Therefore, these resting cells function as nano-microbial factories powered by light.

External control (e.g. wireless) over specific cellular function has been a long-standing objective in biology (Ref. 1). While such control, e.g. external regulation, can provide unprecedented insights into molecular biology, it can also form the basis for several new biotechnological techniques ranging from diagnosis and therapeutics to the generation of biofuels and bioproducts.

In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a platform technology comprising nano-biohybrid organisms (or nanorgs) using semiconductor nanoparticles which can be designed for affinity binding to desired proteins by facile transport, uptake, and self-assembly, and matched to the electrochemical potential of the enzyme to trigger them externally using electromagnetic radiation, e.g. light, etc. As a specific application and to demonstrate broader applicability of methods described herein, the formation of such living nano-biohybrid organisms (or nanorgs) using nonlimiting strains of Azotobacter vinelandii and Cupriavidus necator bacteria strains is shown with a desired enzyme activation for targeted chemical generation using light in these non-photosynthetic microbes.

In one embodiment, the presently contemplated engineered strains of naturally occurring and synthetic bacteria can accomplish industrial reactions using chemical energy to generate electrons and reduce renewable chemical feedstocks like, for e.g., CO2, H2O, and air, and can be labeled as living factories (FIG. 1A) (Ref. 2). Both A. vinelandii and C. necator normally derive the energy needed for the chemical transformations of feedstocks to biofuels from sugars, since such non-photosynthetic microbes cannot directly utilize the sunlight like, for e.g., the photoautotrophs.

Unsuccessful attempts have previously been made to combine the desired functionality of direct light-activation in cell-free extracts or purified enzymes for in vitro biocatalysis or bioelectrocatalysis.3-6 But these strategies have some limitations due to enzyme de-activation in the air or during chemical conversion, without an ability to regenerate the enzyme using the living cell. Other in vivo efforts have been targeted in specific strains of whole non-photosynthetic bacteria,7,8 but can limit their applicability due to specific tolerance of the bacteria to inorganic elements and a smaller range of chemicals that can be made. Further, both these processes lack the desired specificity of enzyme activation in living cells, and there is a need to develop a platform technology for such desired living nano-biohybrids for applications beyond solar energy conversion and catalysis, to new avenues in diagnosis and therapeutics. There has been an intensive search for a new method to combine multiple functionalities (e.g., light, voltage, or magnetic field stimulation) of inorganic nanomaterials with the versatility of metabolic networks in living cells, to simply “grow” such hybrid catalysts or convert existing living cells into nanorgs, by the simple addition of inorganic nanomaterials to the cellular medium/water.

The present invention demonstrates the potential of multifunctional living nanorgs by suspending normally non-photosynthetic bacteria in buffered water (in the absence of any sugar) and converting renewable feedstocks like, for e.g., air and CO2 directly into biofuels and specialty chemicals using these solar-powered factories. Using different core semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) with tunable bandgap energies (such as CdS, CdSe, InP, and Cu2ZnSnS4), and an optimized two monolayer ZnS shell, the chemical binding affinity of zinc is utilized with either a histidine-tagged MoFe nitrogenase in A. vinelandii or Fe—S clusters in hydrogenases and quinones in C. necator, demonstrating the facile formation of nanorgs by self-assembly and simple addition of QDs in the media/buffered water.

These biocatalysts demonstrate high conversion yields to target products (10-100 mg of product/g of dry weight of cells/day) without the utilization of sugar as a source of energy, comparable to or even exceeding (up to −150%) native production levels. The potentially high quantum yields from such light-driven chemical generation (up to 10-20%) depends on the optimization between biocatalyst turnover, incident light-flux, and the amount of light absorbed. Together, these results demonstrate an unprecedented opportunity for development of these nanorgs as renewable sugar-free microbial factories for the production of biofuels and chemicals using sunlight in a scalable process, but also as a means of externally regulating the cellular function of living cells using electromagnetic-stimuli such as light, sound, or magnetic field. In some embodiments, the present invention contemplates nanorg microbial factories including, but not limited to, light-driven renewable biochemical synthesis using quantum dot-bacteria nano-biohybrids.

In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates multifunctional living nanorgs by suspending a range of different normally non-photosynthetic bacteria in buffered water (in the absence of any sugar) and converting renewable feedstocks like, for e.g., air and CO2 directly into biofuels and specialty chemicals using these solar-powered factories (FIG. 1A). Using different core semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) with tunable bandgap energies (such as cadmium sulfide (CdS), cadmium selenide (CdSe), indium phosphide (InP), and copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4)), and an optimized two monolayer zinc sulfide (ZnS) shell, the chemical binding affinity of zinc was utilized with either a histidine-tagged MoFe nitrogenase in A. vinelandii or Fe—S clusters in hydrogenases and quinones in C. necator, demonstrating the facile formation of nanorgs by self-assembly and simple addition of QDs in the media/buffered water. These biocatalysts demonstrate high conversion yields to target products (10-100 mg of product/g of dry weight of cells/day) without the utilization of sugar as a source of energy, comparable to or even exceeding (>150%) native production levels. The high quantum yields from such light-driven chemical generation (13%) depend on the optimization between biocatalyst turnover, incident light-flux, and the amount of light absorbed. While the enzyme turnover and mismatch with the photon flux limits the overall light-to-chemical conversion efficiency (16-20%), better matching the light absorbed in these biohybrids with enzymatic conversion rates through enzyme upregulation or matching incident photon flux can result in improved photon-to-fuel conversion. Together, these results demonstrate an unprecedented opportunity for development of these nanorgs as renewable sugar-free microbial factories for the production of biofuels and chemicals using sunlight in a scalable process, but also as a means of externally regulating the cellular function of living cells using electromagnetic-stimuli such as light, sound, or magnetic field.

### I. Nano-Biohybrid Organisms

A. Core-Shell Quantum Dots.

The core-shell quantum dots (QDs) as contemplated herein were empirically designed and tested. In one embodiment, the disclosed QDs comprise zinc-rich shells for attachment to intracellular proteins of living bacteria. Advantages of the present QDs overcome previous beliefs in the art that incorporation of QDs in living bacteria may cause host bacteria to die. In some embodiments, the present invention contemplates coating the QD with a cysteine zwitterion ligand coating that facilitates uptake of the QD through the cell and improves cell survival.

At least seven different core-shell quantum dots (QDs), with excitations ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared irradiation were chosen during the development of the present invention based upon the electron emission energy released by the irradiated/illuminated QD for matching a particular energy targeted to the energy level of a particular enzyme site in bacteria. When illuminated by light, these QDs were contemplated to act as a catalyst for increasing enzyme activity of the energy-matched enzyme.

In some preferred embodiments, the production of biofuels comprises using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and with nitrogen oxygen provided by air, as substrates. In some embodiments, the production of biofuels is renewable, from the aspect that the same engineered bacteria strains can be grown in large batches and used to produce the same biofuel.

The generation (accumulation) of the corresponding products are shown in FIG. 15.

### II. Exemplary Compositions And Products

A. Biodiesel: C11-C15 methyl ketones, e.g. C2H4, and C11.

Wild-type and genetically-engineered Cupriavidus necator (C. necator) strains for methyl-ketone (MK) production were produced by inserting plasmid pJM20 into C. necator by electroporation as detailed in Muller et. al., Plasmid pJM20 contains the entire MK pathway (‘tesA, fadB, Mlut_11700, and fadM) under the control of BAD promoter. PBAD (araBp; arabinose promoter) is regulated by the addition and absence of arabinose.

Bacteria were grown at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm, in the minimal salt media (MSM) supplied with 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol, and the production of MK was realized via induction with 0.2% L-arabinose after 24 h inoculation (count as t=0).

For MK analysis (Muller), 5 ml cell suspension was mixed with 2 ml hexane followed by vigorous shaking for 30 min. After centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 5 min), the upper hexane layer was collected and concentrated (using N2 flow) to 100 1 pd of the hexane layer was injected for GC analysis (180° C. constant oven temperature).

For methyl (MK) production, after induction with L-arabinose (0.2% w/V), 1 ml culture was sampled for assay.

FIG. 4G shows high MK production using IPZS around 125%.

B. Gasoline: 2,3-butanediol (BDO).

Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strains were utilized using 2,3-butanediol (H16_BO2-20_int) chromosome integration. The strains were grown at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm, in the minimal salt media (MSM) supplied with 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol.

C. Alcohols: Isopropanol (IPA).

Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strains were utilized for IPA using (H16_IPAl-10_int) chromosome integration. The strains were grown at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm, in the minimal salt media (MSM) supplied with 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol. Additionally, alcohols such as butane diol, were produced for use as gasoline additives and gasoline substitutes.

For IPA and BDO analysis, 1 ml cell suspension was lysed with an ultrasonic probe (3 cycles, 1 min each) followed by centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was directly injected (1 fil) into the GC. For IPA, a constant oven temperature (140° C.) was used, whereas programmed temperature ramping (140° C. for 2 min, and 10° C./min ramping to 200° C.) was used for BDO analysis.

D. Ethylene (C2H4).

Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strains were utilized for Ethylene (C2H4) (pBBRl-efe) plasmid. The strains were grown at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm, in the minimal salt media (MSM) supplied with 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol.

E. Degradable bioplastics: PHB.

Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strains were utilized for PHB (pBBRl-yfp) plasmid. The strains were grown at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm, in the minimal salt media (MSM) supplied with 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol.

FIG. 5 wild-type C. necator pBBR1-YFP, CZS2 QDs, 400 nm light irradiation, for PHB production.

To demonstrate the efficiency of our sugar-free nanorg system in different light-excited redox reactions, we compared the chemical production yield in our nanorgs (with wild-type and C. necator strains expressing heterologous genes for the production of C2H4, IPA, BDO, or MKs) test with the yield in their natural growth (organolithotropic with fructose/glycerol or formate) conditions (FIG. 4G).

Even for the un-optimized C2H4, IPA, BDO, and MK producing strains, we observed a 10-50% biofuel production, compared to their native conditions. Most notably, when comparing PHB production (a native metabolite produced by C. necator), nanorgs exhibit up to 150% the PHB yield of wild-type cells. Further, the production was easily scaled up from several milliliter tests to liters by simply using a conventional bioreactor with LED panels (FIG. 5).

F. Fertilizer: Ammonia (NH3) and Hydrogen.

Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strains were utilized for ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen.

The decrease in quantum efficiency (or the saturation of NH3/H2 generation) with higher photon numbers was mainly due to accumulation of the products (functioning as inhibitors), and a replenishment of the reaction media (FIG. 23) showed an almost 100% recovery in NH3 production.

G. Formic acid (FA).

Generation of formate from CO2 provides one embodiment of a method for sequestration of carbon from this greenhouse gas. In some embodiments, nanorgs of the present inventions are provided for producing formic acid and derivative chemicals from CO2. Enzymes include formate oxidases and formate dehydrogenases, e.g. derived from Clostridium carboxidivorans, for catalyzing the reduction of CO2. Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strains were utilized for Formic acid (FA). In some embodiments, carbon sequestration refers to a process involved in carbon atom capture and storage, e.g. short-term or long-term, of atmospheric carbon, e.g. carbon dioxide (CO2). In some embodiments, stored carbon may be used for generating compounds as described herein.

With the replacement of LED lights to sunlight, the solar-powered, green product reactor for renewable generation of these targeted biofuels and bioproducts can also be realized commercially.

Choice of QD Core with Desirable Redox Potential.

One initial step towards the development of such living organisms is in vivo site-specific self-assembly, for chemically and energetically coupling the QDs and specific proteins within the synthetic bacteria. To accomplish the desired reaction driven by QD excitation, the reaction center and attachment site for the QD were identified. We designed these nanorgs by appropriately choosing the QD size and material ((Ref. 5, 6) (core-shells, since different materials were required for energetic alignment and chemical coupling/biocompatibility), QD surface charge and ligands (Reference Nos. 7, 8), and the desired site-specific attachment (9). The core QDs were selected using their size- and material-tunable conduction/valence bandedge positions (FIG. 1B) and absorption spectrum, covering the whole ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectra (FIG. 1A, 1C). To ensure proper energetic alignment and efficient electron injection from the conduction band of photoexcited QDs to selected enzymes (e.g., the molybdenum-iron nitrogenase (MFN) enzyme (Reference Nos. 3, 10, 11) in A. vinelandii, [Fe—S] clusters in the hydrogenases and quinones of C. necator), we conducted in situ experiments with the purified enzyme-QD biohybrids for light-induced catalysis. Our choice of QDs was driven by their strong light absorption in the specific wavelength range (FIG. 1A), easy control of their size (Ref. 12), and tunability of their quantum-confined conduction/valence band positions (Ref. 13).

Different sizes of CdS QDs (FIG. 12A) were investigated to absorb the ultraviolet, CdSe QDs (FIG. 12B) to absorb the visible, and InP and CZTS QDs to absorb the near-infrared (NIR) photons. These QDs were specifically chosen to energetically match the reduction potential of the enzymes (Ref. 14, 15), using detailed electrochemical measurements of the QDs (reference Nos. 16-18) (FIG. 1B, FIG. 13A-G, Table S3). While the QDs had the desired electrochemical potential, simply mixing the QDs with the purified enzymes led to low or insignificant photocatalytic activity in QD-enzyme biohybrids (FIG. 2A, MFN), likely due to poor charge injection efficiency of the photogenerated electron (FIG. 12D, FIG. 12E-I, Table S4). Therefore, we developed a robust and tunable platform to evaluate affinity attachment to the desired enzymes, to ensure efficient charge injection and good biocompatibility.

The first step towards the development of such living organisms is in vivo site-specific self-assembly, for chemically and energetically coupling the QDs and specific proteins within the synthetic bacteria. While chemical conversion in biohybrid systems can also be achieved using the formation of intermediates using inorganic catalysis or electrochemistry, followed by utilization of these intermediates by bacteria,9-12 direct chemical conversion of inexpensive substrates using light in a bacteria as a platform is still challenging. Such a platform method, envisioned as non-genetically encoded (enzyme regeneration would lead to loss of photosensitization), self-assembled nano-biohybrid enzymes in nanorgs, could even allow selectively triggering cell function for diagnostic evaluation or therapy. To accomplish the desired reaction driven by QD excitation, the reaction center and attachment site for the QD were identified. We designed these nanorgs by appropriately choosing the QD size and material (Ref. 13, 14) (core-shells, since different materials were required for energetic alignment and chemical coupling/biocompatibility), QD surface charge and ligands, (Ref. 15, 16) and the desired site-specific attachment. (Ref. 17). The core QDs were selected using their size- and material-tunable conduction/valence bandedge positions (FIG. 1b) and absorption spectrum, covering the whole ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) spectra (FIG. 1a,c). To ensure proper energetic alignment and efficient electron injection from the conduction band of photoexcited QDs to selected enzymes (e.g., the molybdenum-iron nitrogenase (MFN) enzyme (Ref. 3, 18, 19) in A. vinelandii, [Fe—S] clusters in the hydrogenases and quinones of C. necator), we conducted in vitro experiments with the purified enzyme-QD biohybrids for light-induced catalysis. Our choice of QDs was driven by their strong light absorption in the specific wavelength range (FIG. 1a), easy control of their size, (Ref. 20). and tunability of their quantum-confined conduction/valence band positions, (Ref. 21). We investigated different sizes of CdS QDs (FIG. 12a) to absorb the ultraviolet, CdSe QDs (FIG. 12b) to absorb the visible, and InP and CZTS QDs to absorb the near-infrared (NIR) photons. These QDs were specifically chosen to energetically match the reduction potential of the enzymes, (Ref. 22, 23) using detailed electrochemical measurements of the QDs (Ref. 24-25) (FIG. 1b, FIG. 13A-M, Table S3). While the QDs had the desired electrochemical potential, simply mixing the QDs with the cell lysate led to low or insignificant photocatalytic activity in QD-enzyme biohybrids. Therefore, we developed a robust and tunable platform to evaluate affinity attachment to the desired enzymes, to ensure efficient charge injection and good biocompatibility.

**Affinity Binding and Self-Assembly.**

Ensuring affinity attachment for chemical coupling and self-assembly between the QDs and the targeted enzymes inside the bacteria (FIG. 2a), (Ref. 27) (19), we screened common biocompatible QD shell materials using large particles for their selectivity in attaching to specific sites on our target proteins. Here, metal-histidine affinity was investigated. We conducted protein-binding tests using the cell lysate (produced from genetically-engineered A. vinelandii DJ995 strain, which contains a His-tagged MFN18) with ZnS and CdS, by incubating them in room temperature followed by eluting the trapped components with imidazole. SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining for the released protein indicates single band (FIG. 2b) with ZnS, showing its selective binding to His-tagged MFN. And no such selectivity was seen with CdS. We have also demonstrated such site-specific binding by using fluorescent CdSe@ZnS core-shell QDs with the cell lysate, by running the mixture through the agarose gel using electrophoresis. Majority of observed fluorescence (FIG. 2c) and cadmium (FIG. 2d) detected from His-tagged MFN band indicates the specific binding between them. Since simply mixing QDs with the desired electrochemical potential with the cell lysate led to low or insignificant photocatalytic activity in QD-enzyme biohybrids (FIG. 2e, MFN), we evaluated potential role for a shell around the QD core. By changing the shell thickness around the QDs, we observed that the low photocatalytic activity of the core could be due to poor charge injection efficiency of the photogenerated electron, as shown with strong reduction of sub-bandgap/trap state recombination (FIG. 12d), clear decrease in interfacial charge injection and capacitance due to trapped charges (FIG. 13e-i) and slower open-circuit potential decay (FIG. 13i, compiled data in Table S4). Using histidine (His)-tagged MFN (10) (produced from the genetically engineered A. vinelandii bacteria) as a test case, strong and selective binding was seen from the cell lysate (CL) with ZnS, as shown in the single stained band from protein electrophoresis (FIG. 13A). However, the CdS particles (core material) showed weaker and non-specific binding to numerous proteins.

To maintain the desired energetic coupling of photoelectron production in CdS and the site-selective MFN binding with ZnS, CdS@ZnS core-shell quantum dots were designed to selectively trap the His-tagged MFN from the cell lysate (prepared from the A. vinelandii DJ995 bacteria) and conduct light-induced in situ redox reactions.

Optimizing the injection of photogenerated electrons from different core QDs to the enzyme active site, the core-shell QDs were synthesized using a layer-by-layer deposition technique (614), with precise control of the ZnS shell thickness (FIG. 12C, FIG. 12D, Table S1). While increased shell thickness ensured site-selective attachment, biocompatibility, improved charge injection of the photogenerated electrons to the active enzyme site, and increased surface passivation reducing surface states/defects; thick ZnS shells also served as a barrier for charge injection from different QDs cores. To realize an optimal design, we coupled CdS@ZnS QDs with nominal x monolayer (ML) ZnS shells (CZS-xML, x=0 to approximately 3, capped with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) ligand) with the cell lysate and tested their photocatalytic efficiency in H2 and NH3 production. We used light-induced (400 nm) H2O and N2—H2O reduction in pH=7.4 media, utilizing either L-ascorbic acid or HEPES as a sacrificial agent. Here, we observed a significant enhancement of H2 and NH3 generation with the QDs-cell lysate biohybrids, generating a maximum of 615 nmol/ml cell lysate for H2 production from H2O reduction and 527/337 nmol/ml cell lysate H2/NH3 production from N2—H2O reduction (net production, with correction using the reaction phase containing QDs, in 30 min) using the biohybrids with 2 ML ZnS-coated QDs (FIG. 3a, FIG. 13B, FIG. 13C). As a comparison, QDs without MFN attachment (zero ML shell) or with thick shells (three MLs) show a negligible yield. The affinity binding of His-tagged MFN to zinc-rich QDs surface was also confirmed by control experiments (FIG. 13D-F), where the addition of imidazole (coordinates with Zn2) or increasing media acidity (protonates histidine) inhibits such interactions (1927) and hence no H2 or NH3 production was observed (same as the systems with QDs as control). Optimal design of a 2 ML thick CdS@ZnS QD-MFN biohybrid was also evident by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (FIG. 3b, FIG. 13G, FIG. 13H small total capacitance and charge transport resistance), open-circuit potential decay (FIG. 13I, Table S4, reduced non-radiative charge recombination) and photoluminescence (FIG. 12D, removal of surface states).

**QD Biocompatibility and Ligands.**

The chemical attachment of QDs (capped with 3-mercaptopropionic acid or cysteine) to the proteins was demonstrated by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra of coupled QDs-CL after washing (to remove any unbound/weakly bound cellular component in CL, FIG. 16G, FIG. 16H), showing characteristic peptide vibration modes and the disappearance of O—H stretching in the QDs-protein complex. Binding of cellular proteins to the QDs was also confirmed by UV-VIS analysis of QDs-CL, purified using centrifugation (FIG. 16A-F). To further investigate the affinity of QDs binding QDs-CL mixtures were separated by gel electrophoresis. Here, highly fluorescent ZnS-capped QDs were detected mainly from the His-tagged MFN band (FIG. 2Ac), where selective QD attachment was confirmed by elemental analysis (FIG. 2Ad) of the His-tagged MFN band and the non-His-tagged protein bands. To further demonstrate the causative link between affinity attachment and the photogenerated electron driven catalytic reduction of air-water using nanorgs, we conducted measurements using a different strain of A. vinelandii (DJ1003) and C. neactor (pBBRl-YFP), which produces apo-nitrogenase enzyme lacking the MoFe cofactor and pBRl-efe plasmids (targeted enzymes), and observed significant decrease in generation of products (FIG. 3A). This demonstrates the importance of simultaneous optimization of surface tuning, photophysics, and charge tunneling (across QD-shell) in designing highly efficient biohybrids. Using this evidence for affinity attachment, in vitro studies with QDs-cell lysate (to decouple the role of QD transport), we demonstrated the simultaneous optimization of surface tuning, photophysics, and charge tunneling (across QD-shell) in designing highly efficient biohybrids.

Another aspect of the QD surface related to nanorg development was the ligand and the overall charge on QDs (9, 20-2317,28-31), which affected their biocompatibility, viability, and the uptake of designed QDs for intracellular self-assembly. Several attempts to combine the desired functionality of QDs with the synthetic versatility of the designed bacteria have relied on cell-free extraction of the enzymes and their coupling with QDs. These approaches showed limitations such as loss of enzyme activity or even deactivation (3, 10, 243-6,18,32) low enzyme concentrations, issues with scale-up, and low-activity and TON for chemical conversion. Using QDs capped with similar-sized ligands as well as different surface charge (negatively-charged MPA, positively-charged cysteamine (CA), and zwitterion cysteine (CYS)), we tested the viability of bacteria with QDs using three different methods. First, when monitoring cell growth by optical density, we observed that bacteria with CYS-capped QDs exhibited growth similar to no treatment, MPA-capped QDs impaired growth moderately, and CA-capped QDs strongly inhibited growth, especially at high concentrations (FIG. 3c, FIG. 18a-d). Under light irradiation with non-growing nanorg cells in the photocatalytic media, cell viability was almost unaffected (FIG. 18j-l)) with both the CYS-capped QDs and the low concentration MPA-capped QDs. With the higher concentration MPA-capped nanoparticles and even the low (50 nM) concentration of CA-capped QDs, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed. Low cell viability could render the cell unable to remove the oxygen in the air and cause deactivation of the oxygen-sensitive enzymes ((reference Nos. 3, 10, 24). This leads to low NH3 production in light-induced air-water reduction using the QDs-living bacterial biohybrids and can be checked by performing the photocatalytic test in a different atmosphere. We observed a significant decrease (by one magnitude) of NH3 yield in air-FhO reduction compared to pure N2 (oxygen-free)-H2O (FIG. 22c, d). The second test utilized on the nanorgs to measure the cell viability was the resazurin dye assay (13), performed after the photocatalytic test, which also demonstrated a high cell viability with both zwitterion and (low concentration) negatively-charged QDs (FIG. 22c, d). A more detailed investigation with colony forming unit analysis (CFU) also showed the same results (FIG. 3e), with the highest viability for zwitterion and negatively-charged QDs. Using the cell size of A. vinelandii (2.7-6.6×1015 liters), the cell viability, even at high QD concentrations (>1000 nM), and modest uptake with zwitterion QDs (approximately 14%, FIG. 2 FIG. 3f), we estimated approximately 104 QDs per cell, which guarantees enough QDs in the cell to couple with available MFN enzymes. QD uptake by the cells was also visualized using laser-scanning confocal microscopy, showing a uniform distribution of QDs inside the bacteria (FIG. 18A-L). Uniform distribution of QDs throughout the cells (monitored using fluorescent QD in a confocal microscope) proves intracellular QD uptake, enabling self-assembly of QDs with enzymes. While the cellular uptake with positively charged CA-capped QDs was much higher than both negative or zwitterions ligands with similar sizes, the strong non-specific attachment of QDs to negatively-charged cell organelles (like, for e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins) could be responsible for the low cell viability, especially at high CA-capped QD concentrations.

Following the design and self-assembly of appropriate QD-bacteria biohybrid nanorgs (QDs with two monolayers thick ZnS shell, capped with cysteine ligand), we tested their ability to fix the energy of incident light-photons into specific chemical bonds using renewable and inexpensive substrates/feedstocks, like, for e.g., air, water, and CO2. Control experiments with either no QDs, light irradiation, or the cells, show no NH3 or C2H4 production in A. vinelandii and C. necator strains (FIG. 22A, FIG. 22B). The same tests conducted under lack of available substrate/feedstock (argon atmosphere, so no N2 or CO2 substrate available) also showed no product generation (FIG. 3B, FIG. 22C). These ruled out the detection/production of NH3 from either a cellular source (nitrogen-containing proteins, amino acid, DNA, etc.) or the media. Further controls included lack of product generation without chemical coupling (FIG. 2A), sudden turn-off of light-driven chemical generation by decoupling the QD-enzyme (FIG. 18B, FIG. 18C), and lack of significant product formation with synthetic constructs which lack the site for affinity QD attachment or charge injection of photogenerated electrons to drive biocatalysis (FIG. 3A).

**Light-Triggered Enzyme Activation**

Further experiments also demonstrated the fixing of incident photon energy, as chemical fuels provide detailed measurements of light-intensity dependent chemical generation (FIG. 23E), a direct correlation between cell viability of the nanorgs and product yield (FIG. 23B-D), and improvement of product formation with nanorg cell optical density leading to higher light absorption (FIG. 23A). The addition of an ionophore (such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP)) into the photocatalytic system further verified chemical generation via direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from QDs to the enzyme. Continuous chemical generation with a minor decrease in yield (FIG. 3C, FIG. 22E) indicates a direct electron injection from QDs to enzyme instead of an ATP-dependent charge transfer via NADPH, for NH3/C2H4 production. To further verify strong chemical and electrochemical coupling between QD-enzyme biohybrids in nanorgs, the addition of sacrificial donors had a minor effect on the chemical generation (FIG. 3D), whereas a much stronger quenching of photogenerated charge carriers and chemical generation would be expected in case of uncoupled QDs or redox shuttles. Intracellular uptake and chemical attachment in nanorgs was also verified using larger nanoparticles, which cannot penetrate the bacterial cell membrane. By using these larger “microparticles” of the same materials, negligible product yields were observed (section: Photocatalytic test with the microparticles), providing further evidence for the importance of affinity binding to specific sites as a necessary step for such photon-driven biocatalysis.

Following the design and self-assembly of appropriate QD-bacteria biohybrid nanorgs (QDs with two monolayers thick ZnS shell, capped with cysteine ligand), we tested their ability to fix the energy of incident light-photons into specific chemical bonds using renewable and inexpensive substrates/feedstocks, like, for e.g., air, water, and CO2. Control experiments with either no QDs, light irradiation, or the cells, show no NH3 or C2H4 production in A. vinelandii and C. necator strains (FIG. 21a,b). Using strains with decreased nitrogen fixation capability (A. vinelandii DJ1003, which produces a His-tagged apo-nitrogenase with no MoFe cofactor) and no ethylene pathway (C. necator pBBR1-YFP, with the lack of “efe” gene for ethylene production), significant decrease of ammonia or no ethylene production (FIG. 4a) was seen. Similar ammonia production tests were also performed by using CdS QDs (without ZnS shell) and an A. vinelandii strain producing non-His-tagged MFN (details in the supporting information), where no site-specific zinc-histidine binding was utilized. In these controls, the ammonia yield also decreased significantly (FIG. 4b) to approximately ⅓, compared to the zinc-histidine binding. The same tests conducted under lack of available substrate/feedstock (argon atmosphere, so no N2 or CO2 substrate available) also showed no product generation (FIG. 4c, FIG. 21c). Isotope (13C) labelling tests (mass spectra, FIG. 21g,h,i) also proves biochemical and biofuel production from 13CO2 as the substrate. These ruled out the detection/production of NH3 and other biofuels from either a cellular source (proteins, amino acid, DNA, etc.) or the media. Further controls included lack of product generation without chemical coupling (FIG. 2e), sudden turn-off of light-driven chemical generation by decoupling the QD-enzyme (FIG. 17e, f), and lack of significant product formation with synthetic constructs which lack the site for affinity QD attachment or charge injection of photogenerated electrons to drive biocatalysis (FIG. 4a). Further experiments also demonstrated the fixing of incident photon energy, as chemical fuels provide detailed measurements of light-intensity dependent chemical generation (FIG. 22e), a direct correlation between cell viability of the nanorgs and product yield (FIG. 22b-d, see descriptions herein for detailed explanations), and improvement of product formation with nanorg cell optical density leading to higher light absorption (FIG. 22a). The addition of an ionophore (such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP)) into the photocatalytic system further verified chemical generation via direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from QDs to the enzyme. The continuous chemical generation with a minor decrease in yield (FIG. 4d, FIG. 21e) indicates a direct electron injection from QDs to enzyme for NH3/C2H4 production. Furthermore, the addition of sacrificial donors had a minor effect on the chemical generation, which strengthens the conclusions from control experiments pointing to the role of QD-enzyme binding (FIG. 4e). Intracellular uptake and chemical attachment in nanorgs was also verified using larger nanoparticles, which cannot penetrate the bacterial cell membrane. By using these larger “microparticles” of the same materials, negligible product yields were observed, providing further evidence for the importance of affinity binding to specific sites as a necessary step for such photon-driven biocatalysis.

After confirming the light-induced redox reaction by direct electron injection in nanorgs, we optimized the conditions further for chemical generation via enzyme activation, utilizing factors including bacterial cell density, irradiation intensity, sacrificial donor concentration (to improve) TOF of enzymes), and QD capping ligands and concentration (FIG. 22A-I). We observed a clear correlation between NH3 production and cellular uptake and cell viability in A. vinelandii DJ995 (also confirmed by parallel experiments in air and a pure nitrogen atmosphere, FIG. 22C, FIG. 22D). Using these conditions (detailed as described herein), we extended our test with various QDs covering absorption spectrum from near-UV, visible, and near-IR.

These QDs form nanorgs with a high TON for NH3 (FIG. 5a), up to 107 (with CZS, CZSe1, and IPZS QDs).

The lower TON for the other nanorgs is mainly due to an unfavorable redox potential match or low absorptivity (especially for CZTS). We also demonstrated the flexibility of the nanorg platform by utilizing direct electron transfer to the living bacteria for different desired fuel generation. By coupling the QDs with a variety of bacterial strains (A. vinelandii DJ995, wild-type and genetically modified C. necator strains), we were able to create nanorgs for H2, NH3, FA, C2H4, IPA, BDO, MKs, and PHB production (FIG. 5b), with high turnover frequencies up to 107 per hour. These nanorgs were able to accumulate different amounts of these chemicals (FIG. 5c), with up to around 100 mg PHB/g cell dry weight (CDW) in one day. Production of H2 and NH3 with time (FIG. 5d, represented as absorbed photon) shows a maximum internal quantum efficiency of about 13.1%. The decrease in quantum efficiency (or the saturation of NH3/H2 generation) with higher photon numbers was mainly due to accumulation of the products (functioning as inhibitors), and a replenishment of the reaction media (FIG. 23) showed an almost 100% recovery in NH3 production. As a comparison, with lower absorbed photons, C2H4 production (FIG. 5e, with CZS QDs) kept increasing with no sign of the saturation effects seen in the NH3 production (less inhibition by C2H4 in the gas phase). However, high photon input (with IPZS QDs) does not help increase the yield, and the quantum yield for C2H4 production is about one magnitude lower than the NH3. This could be due to the un-optimized C2H4 producing C. necator strains (where a small portion of electrons are converted to C2H4 due to the complex regulation of native pathways required to produce substrates for the heterologously expressed ethylene-forming enzyme (Reference No. 25)), compared to the N2-fixing A. vinelandii strains for NH3 production.

**Characterization of Biocatalytic Conversion.**

Optimizing the turnover number of light-driven chemical generation using nanorgs, we investigated the turnover frequency of the enzymes by comparing the photon flux for activation of the self-assembled QD-enzyme biohybrids, activated using light for converting photons to chemical bonds. First, we estimated the photon flux per biohybrid enzyme, by determining the light flux (approximately 1.6 mW/cm2) and using photon energy (approximately 2 eV) to obtain photon flux (5×1015 photons/sec/cm2). Using the optical density of the cells and the resulting nanorgs per unit area (approximately 108 nanorgs/cm2) and the estimated number of biohybrid enzymes (approximately 10,000 biohybrid enzymes/nanorg), we obtained the photon flux per biohybrid enzymes (approximately 5000 photons/biohybrid enzyme/sec). Comparing this to enzyme turnover (for MFN enzyme, 3000 nmol/mg/sec for 250 kDa enzyme≈(approximately equal to) 750/sec), we estimated an approximately 6-fold incident photons/enzyme turnover, thereby highlighting the mismatch between the number of biohybrid enzymes available for chemical generation in the nanorgs and the high incident flux of light. This would limit the maximum possible quantum efficiency to approximately 16-20%, further highlighting the high efficiency of enzyme activation using light (13% in our experiments), and the resulting biofuel and chemical generation using nanorgs. This could be optimized by utilizing synthetic biology tools to upregulate the enzymes, thereby coupling the photon flux to enzyme turnover, or reducing the photon flux. To study photon-energy related fuel production, we chose the nanorgs made from IPZS QDs (broader absorption spectrum) with the C2H4 producing C. necator strain, using the same test under different light sources (AM 1.5 (with 400 nm long pass filter), white, purple, blue, and green LED). All these light sources are able to excite the nanorgs for C2H4 production (FIG. 5f), with the purple photons showing the highest efficiency compared to the blue and green photons. Moreover, high production with AM 1.5 irradiation indicates the possibility of using sunlight as an energy source to power the nanorg factories for solar fuel production. To demonstrate the efficiency of our sugar-free nanorg system in different light-excited redox reactions, we compared the chemical production yield in our nanorgs (with wild-type and C. necator strains expressing heterologous (exogenous) genes for the production of C2H4, IPA, BDO, or MKs) test with the yield in their natural growth (organolithotropic with fructose/glycerol or formate) conditions (FIG. 4G, FIG. 5g). Even for the un-optimized C2H4, IPA, BDO, and MK producing strains, we observed a 10-50% biofuel production, compared to their native conditions.

Most notably, when comparing PHB production (a native metabolite produced by C. necator), nanorgs exhibit up to 150% the PHB yield of wild-type cells. Further, the production was easily scaled up from several milliliter tests to liters by simply using a conventional bioreactor with LED panels (FIG. 5, FIG. 6). Using the wild-type PHB producing strains in the photobioreactor (approximately 4 L) with a similar condition (as in the 5 ml test scale), we were able to obtain gram-scale production of PHB, with no noticeable change of yield compared to small-scale test. The scaled-up production indicated the potential capability of our system in further scaling up, from lab scale (several liters) to a pilot scale plant (approximately 1000 L), and eventually even to a commercial level (>40,000 L) with little change of the configuration. With the replacement of LED lights to sunlight, the solar-powered, green product reactor for renewable generation of these targeted biofuels and bioproducts can also be realized commercially. These results demonstrate the potential application of our nanorgs platform in direct, scalable, and renewable generation of fuels from sunlight, using air or CO2, and the ability to activate a range of targeted enzymes externally, using electromagnetic stimuli.

Biochemical conversion can also be realized by using electricity. In electro-biochemical synthesis,34 the bacteria are immobilized on a modified electrode, which can inject electrons for downstream enzymatic reactions. The two processes: electro-biochemical synthesis and photo-biochemical synthesis, can be compared as photovoltaic driven-electrochemical synthesis and photocatalysis. The electro-biochemical approach circumvents several requirements of QDs-bacteria interactions, including QD uptake and low QD toxicity, making the design easier. However, electro-biochemical synthesis is limited to some special microbes that can exchange electrons with electrodes, and the requirements of immobilization and using redox mediators. Furthermore, there are no mechanisms in specifically targeting a desired enzyme or metabolic pathway for selective biochemical conversions. Therefore, photo-biochemical synthesis by using a designed QD-microbe biohybrid can offer additional advantages over other methods.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a method for the formation of a living QD-bacterial nano-biohybrid nanorgs via the design of appropriate QDs and facile mixing, self-assembly, and affinity binding to the desired enzymes. Using a range of different light-absorbing QDs and targeted enzymes in different bacterial strains, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed direct activation of the enzyme and the generation of biofuels and chemicals from non-photosynthetic microbes by simply suspending them in buffered water and bubbling air and/or CO2. Large turnover numbers and frequencies along with the high quantum efficiency for the direct conversion of light into chemicals were obtained for biofuel precursors and specialty chemicals including MKs, BDO, H2, IPA, NH3, FA, and PHB, demonstrating the potential and a possible application of the proposed method.

The biochemical conversion yields of the proposed method to simply utilize formed nanorgs, CO2 and water, in absence of sugar, even exceeded the natural yields in growing media (>150%), limited by the enzyme turnover. While maximum achievable quantum efficiency of light-to-chemical conversion can be 16-20% in the nanorgs, due to slow enzymatic conversion (˜1.3 msec) compared to absorbed light flux in the spontaneously self-assembled nano-biohybrids, high conversion efficiencies of light-activated chemical conversion (13%) highlights the potential of such simple platform for making self-assembled nanorgs and ability of electromagnetic enzyme activation. Further, such catalytic conversion can be optimized by upregulating the desired enzymes using tools in synthetic biology, and better matching the incident photon flux with the achievable turnover of the enzymes, for improved energy conversion.

This technique can easily be scaled up; be extended by improved screening for affinity binding to the proteins, expanding the scope of making nanorgs with other prokaryotes and eukaryotes; testing theories in molecular biology; and developing new diagnostic and therapeutic methods using other external stimuli, e.g. sound waves; magnetic field, etc.

### IV. Cellular Enzyme Preparation and Characterization.

A. A. vinelandii DJ995 Bacteria Growth and Cell Lysate Preparation.

In one embodiment, A. vinelandii DJ995 bacteria (wild type, with a histidine tagged MoFe nitrogenase on the C-terminus of the a-subunit), producing MoFe nitrogenase with 7× histidine tag on the C-terminal of the a-subunit was used. The cells were grown (31 s) in a nitrogen-free modified Burk media (500 ml for each batch, in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask) with air bubbling (approximately 1 LPM) and shaking (approximately 300 rpm) for 24 hours (to an optical density of −1.5 at 600 nm). The resulting cells (dark brown color as shown in FIG. 39B, left) were centrifuged (precipitated) at 6,000 rpm and washed twice with equivalent buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.9) and stored at −80° C. The cell lysate was prepared using ultrasonication (anaerobic and 4° C. condition). The frozen cells (approximately 8 gram) were anaerobically thawed and suspended in 16 ml fully degassed equivalent buffer (with 0.2 mM PMSF and 2 mM sodium dithionite), and the resulting cell suspension was ruptured in a side-arm test tube (flushed with UPC argon) using an ultrasonic probe at full power (Fisher Sonic Dismembrator Model D100, with 1/1 min sonication/rest for 10 cycles). The cell suspension was cooled using an ice-water bath and the sonication was taken at 1 min sonication and 1 min rest cycle for 10 cycles. The cells were anaerobically transferred to an argon-flushed ultracentrifuge tube (Beckmann Coulter #355618) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm (Beckmann Coulter L8-70M, with the Ti-45 rotor) for 30 min. The dark brown supernatant (FIG. 39B) was dropped into liquid nitrogen (LN2) using an air-tight syringe and stored as pellets (in LN2) prior to use.

1. Cell Lysate Activity Determination.

The cell lysate activity (Table S5, in the unit of nmol H2/NH3 per milliliter cell lysate per minute) in both enzymatic proton reduction (H2 generation) and the dinitrogen-water reduction was determined by a modified method reported by Dean et al, (Refs. 32S7 47).

2. Proton Reduction.

Enzymatic proton reduction was measured in a 25 ml septum sealed vial under a UPC argon atmosphere. One (1) ml from the reaction phase containing 25 mM TES (pH 7.4), 2.5 mM ATP, 5.0 mM MgCb, 30 mM creatine phosphate and 0.125 mg creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was fully degassed, sodium dithionite (solid) was then added to a final concentration of 20 mM. The headspace was charged with argon, and the vial was kept in a 30° C. water bath. The reaction was initiated by injection of 50 μl freshly thawed cell lysate (pellets stored in LN2) and terminated at 15 min by injecting 0.25 ml 2.5 M H2SO4. The headspace gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (SRI 8610C) with a molecular sieves 5 A column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (sampling volume: 0.1 ml). The coefficient between peak area and amount of H2 (nmol) was determined by pure H2.

3. N2—H2O Reduction.

Enzymatic dinitrogen-water reduction was conducted using a method similar to the one used for proton reduction, with the replacement of the headspace gas by UHP N2 and the buffer by 35 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, to avoid interference in the NH3 assay). 0.25 ml 0.4 M EDTA (pH 8.0) was injected after 15 min to terminate the reaction. The amount of NH3 was determined using the o-phthalaldehyde fluorescence method (Refs. 3, 48). 25 μl from the reaction phase was added to 0.5 ml of assay reagent (pH=7.3) containing 20 mM o-phthalaldehyde, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, 5% ethanol and 3.4 mM mercaptoethanol. The mixture was maintained in the dark for at least 30 min and the emission was measured at 472 nm with a 410 nm excitation. NH3 calibration curves were obtained by using NH4CI in the same assay. Different concentration of NH4CI was used to obtain the calibration curve (FIG. 25).

B. MoFe Nitrogenase (MFN) Purification.

The MFN protein from A. vinelandii DJ995 bacteria has a 7× histidine tag on the C-terminus of the a-subunit, allowing it to be purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (10, 25). The zinc ion was selected as the binding metal due to the use of sodium dithionite (DTT) reducing agent in the buffer. The column (Hitrap IMAC FF 1 ml, GE Healthcare) was charged with zinc (0.1 M ZnSO4/O and equilibrated with fully degassed equivalent buffer (with 2 mM DTT, pH 7.9). The cell lysate was loaded on to the column and washed with equivalent buffer and washing buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 or 0.2? mM imidazole (PMSF) and 2 mM DTT, pH 7.9) to remove non-specific proteins. The His-tagged MFN protein was eluted using the elution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 250 mM imidazole and 2 mM DTT, pH 7.9). The elution (dark brown color) was stored as small pellets in LN2, for future use. Protein purity and concentration were determined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Bradford assay, respectively.

C. C. necator Culture.

Wild-type and genetically-engineered C. necator strainsS1,S8 were utilized for PHB (e.g. H16+pBBR1-PphaC-YFP) plasmid, (pBBRl-yfp) plasmid, etc., ethylene (pBBRl-efe) plasmid, isopropanol (H16_IPAl-10_int) chromosome integration, and 2,3-butanediol (H16_BO2-20_int) chromosome integration. The strains were grown at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm, in the minimal salt media (MSM) supplied with 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol.

Strains for methyl-ketone (MK) production was grown in MSM supplied with 2% fructose, and the production of MK was realized via induction with 0.2% L-arabinose after 24 h inoculation (count as t=0).

D. Construction of C. necator Plasmids and Strains.

Plasmids were constructed in the pBBR1-MCS2 backbone. E. coli strains were propagated at 37° C. in lysogeny broth (LB). Where necessary, medium was solidified with 1.5% (wt/vol) agar and supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The promoter from the phaC gene in C. necator was used to drive transcription of YFP (control), Ethylene-forming enzyme (efe, from Pseudomonas syringae). Ref S9. Conjugation was performed by transformation of plasmids into the mobilizing strain S-17 E. coli followed by incubation of the transformed cells overnight with C. necator on LB, followed by selection on LB+15 μl gentamicin (to select against S-17 cells) and 300 μl kanamycin. Ref. S10. Transformation of plasmids was verified by colony PCR and/or plasmid extraction and restriction digest validation.

E. Analysis of the Products Generated from C. necator.

For PHB, isopropanol (IPA), and 2,3-butanediol (BDO) production, the culture was sampled (1 ml) at a specific time point for analysis. For methyl (MK) production, after induction with L-arabinose (0.2% w/V), 1 ml culture was sampled for assay. C2H4 production was conducted in a septum-sealed vial, with 5 ml liquid phase containing OD600=1.0 cells in MSM media (with 40 mM formic acid). The headspace (25 ml) was sampled at a specific time point.

For PHB analysis (Ref. 33), 1 ml culture was centrifuged, and the pellet (washed once with MSM media) was mixed with 0.4 ml 3:7 HCkMeOH and 0.6 ml 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) and incubated at 100° C. for two hours with gentle shaking (every 15 min). After cooling to room temperature, 0.3 ml DI water was added with vigorous shaking and the bottom layer (DCE layer) was injected into the GC (1 μl, oven temperature: 140° C.) for analysis.

For IPA and BDO analysis, 1 ml cell suspension was lysed with an ultrasonic probe (3 cycles, 1 min each) followed by centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was directly injected (1 μl) into the GC. For IPA, a constant oven temperature (140° C.) was used, whereas programmed temperature ramping (140° C. for 2 min, and 10° C./min ramping to 200° C.) was used for BDO analysis.

For MK analysis (Ref 33), 5 ml cell suspension was mixed with 2 ml hexane followed by vigorous shaking for 30 min. After centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 5 min), the upper hexane layer was collected and concentrated (using N2 flow) to 100 μl. One (1) μl of the hexane layer was injected for GC analysis (180° C. constant oven temperature).

The generation (accumulation) of the corresponding products, together with the bacteria cell optical density (at 600 nm) are shown in FIG. 16A-H.

### V. QDs-Enzyme Complex Preparation And Characterization.

A. UV-VIS Determination of QDs-Protein Binding.

Further evidence supporting QD-attachment is provided by the UV-VIS measurements of solutions containing CL and a 500 nM concentration of CZSe3. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in 35 mM HEPES buffer prior to performing the following experiment.

Initially, strong PL and absorbance of the QDs in FIG. 16A-B is observed with minimal contribution from CL. After centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 5 min, the isolated pellet containing CL proteins is clearly luminescent due to attachment of the water-soluble QDs, which would normally not precipitate from solution at such a mild rpm. The PL and absorption spectra of the supernatant confirm this (FIG. 16C-D), showing that a very small amount of QDs are present in the supernatant (not attached to the CL proteins). Spectra of the redispersed QDs-CL pellet (FIG. 16E-F) shows confirmation that QDs are retained within the pellet by CL.

B. Fourier-Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).

Thermo Nicolet 6700 FTIR instrument was used for infrared spectroscopy measurements, using a germanium attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. QDs-cell lysate, QDs, and cell lysate samples were prepared for the test. Cell lysate (prepared from A. vinelandii DJ995 or C. necator pBBRl-efe) in Tris buffer was desalted (using 10 kDa centrifugal device) and washed with DI water twice to remove interfering Tris components. QDs-cell lysate complex was prepared by mixing the cell lysate with MPA-coated CZSe3 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, the resulting pellets were washed twice with DI (deionized) water. No precipitate was observed when cell lysate or MPA-coated QDs suspension (in pH 11 water) was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm up to 30 min. The pellets formed in the mixture are due to the formation of QDs-protein complex. Samples were drop-casted on clean glass slides followed by air-drying.

FTIR was used to show proteins coupled to the QDs. The QDs are able to trap the proteins from the cell lysate, as shown by the similarity of the QDs-CL and CL spectra (FIG. 16G-H), with characteristic C=0 stretching (1655 cm−1), N—H bending (1540 cm−1), and N—H stretching (3250 cm1, broad due to hydrogen bond formation) indicating the presence of bound proteins (amide). Coupling of the protein to the QDs is further proven by the disappearance of the O—H stretching (3395 cm1, broad) in the MPA-capped QDs, where the —OH group from the original carboxyl terminated QDs was replaced by the —NH bond through amidation with the amine bond.

C. SDS-PAGE Protein Electrophoresis: Determination of Protein Bound to CdS or ZnS.

To evaluate the selectivity of CdS and ZnS in protein binding, cellular protein trapped by their corresponding particles were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

1. Selective Protein Binding to CdS or ZnS.

CdS and ZnS particles were synthesized using the reaction of 0.1 M Cd2+ (CdCl2) or Zn2+ (ZnSO4) with 0.1 M S2+ (Na2S). The particles were washed with water (twice) and equivalent buffer (twice) and suspended in equivalent buffer. About 10 mg CdS or ZnS were charged with 1 ml cell lysate and incubated at 4° C. for 1 hour. The mixture was then centrifuged and washed with equivalent buffer (0.3 ml, twice) and wash buffer (0.3 ml) and re-suspended in 0.1 ml equivalent buffer.

2. Determination of Protein Bound to CdS or ZnS.

The proteins bound to CdS or ZnS were determined using SDS-PAGE. The CdS and ZnS particles with trapped (bound) proteins were boiled with SDS sample buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove the particles. The samples were loaded on the 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and the electrophoresis was run using constant voltage (200 V), followed by staining with Coomassie G250 to show the protein bands (FIG. 2AB). Cell lysate and purified MoFe nitrogenase were also tested as references.

Selective His-tagged protein binding can be clearly seen with ZnS particles, showing an almost single protein band (FIG. 2AB, lane 5 FIG. S6A, lane 5). Compared to the purified MFN (FIG. 2AB, lane 3), its selectivity in His-tagged MFN is as good as the commercial Zn-IMAC column. On the other hand, CdS showed almost no selectivity in protein binding (FIG. 2AB, lane 4). This test shows that ZnS-coated CdS nanoparticles for selective MoFe nitrogenase binding for photocatalytic H2 or NH3 production is preferred.

The A. vinelandii MoFe protein has two alpha (MoFe co-factor) and two beta (P-cluster) subunits, with molecular weights of 55.3 (plus approximately 1 for 7× histidine tag) and 59.5 kDa, respectively.

D. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (AGE).

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (AGE) was performed to prove the selective coupling between the ZnS-coated QDs and His-tagged MFN. Different proteins in the cell lysate are separated based on their molecular weight and charge, and the coupling of proteins to the QDs could show a change in the electrophoretic migration pattern. To use visible QDs, we used MPA-capped CdSe@ZnS QDs (CZSe1 and CZSe2 with peak emission at 540 and 570 nm, two monolayer ZnS coating) instead of non-fluorescent CdS@ZnS QDs for fluorescent detection of the QDs. The fresh-thawed cell lysate was mixed with QDs and incubated at room temperature for half an hour, followed by loading on 1% agarose gel. The electrophoresis was performed under constant voltage (200 V) mode for 1 hour. The gel was then gently rinsed with DI water and imaged using Gel Doc EZ imager on a UV tray (Bio-Rad), with excitation at 470 nm and emission at 570 nm, (FIG. 2AC: panels A and C). Protein locations were indicated (FIG. 2AC, panels B and D) by using Coomassie brilliant blue G250 staining as above, and as described herein. Control experiments with one each of cell lysate, QDs-purified MFN mixture, purified MFN, and QDs were also performed on the same gel.

Fluorescence images clearly shows the existence and the position of QDs in the gel (FIG. 2Ac, panel A) The migration of the QDs depends mainly on their size and surface charge, and a larger size QDs (FIG. 2AC, panel C, lane 8) show slower migration compared to the smaller ones (FIG. 2AC, panel C, lane 7). Coupling between the QDs and the purified MFN (formation of QDs-MFN complex), FIG. 2AC, panel C, lanes 5 and 6, resulted in a large lag in electrophoretic migration due to a significant increase in particle (QDs-protein corona) size. We have also shown selectivity in the binding of QDs with a specific protein, by comparing the electrophoretic migration patterns of QDs-cell lysate and QDs-purified MFN in the fluorescence and staining images. Multiple bands in the staining image (right figure, lane 1 to 3) indicate the existence of different proteins (with varied molecular weight) in the cell lysate, while the fluorescence mainly originates from the single band of MFN, as indicated by the same emission position of QDs-cell lysate (lane 2 and 3) and QDs-purified MFN (lane 5 and 6). This proved that the majority of the QDs are bound to the MFN, and this selectivity between ZnS-coated QDs and His-tagged MFN is based on the zinc-histidine affinity. To further verify that the QDs can selectively couple the His-tagged MFN, the fluorescent band was cut for orbitrap mass spectroscopy to identify the proteins. As shown in the attached “Protein Mass Spec.xlsx” file, the two major peptides detected (with highest MS/MS count) is the nitrogenase beta chain and alpha chain, demonstrating that the ZnS-coated QDs preferentially trap the His-tagged proteins.

E. Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS).

ICP-MS was used to determine the level of cadmium to quantify the efficiency and selectivity of QDs-protein coupling. The CZSe2-cell lysate lane (FIG. 2Ac, lane 3) from the agarose gel was utilized, and the MFN band and one non-MFN band was excised from the gel and digested with nitric acid, in a final sample volume of 0.5 ml. Cell lysate lane (lane 1) with corresponding bands were used as control (baseline for the cadmium level). Selectivity of His-tagged MFN attachment to the ZnS-coated QDs was seen in FIG. 2Ad, FIG. 176C, as the cadmium level (ppb) in the MFN band is more than three times the level in the non-MFN band.

F. QDs-MFN Biohybrid for Light-Induced Proton Reduction: CdX:Nitrogenase Biohybrid Photocatalytic Proton Reduction.

MPA-capped CdS or CdSe QDs were anaerobically mixed with the purified nitrogenase. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for about 10 min and diluted with fully degassed 100 mM L-ascorbic acid (pH=7.4). The mixture (with 200 nM QDs and 66 nM nitrogenase) was anaerobically transferred to several argon-purged 2 ml GC vials (with a small magnetic stirrer, 0.3 ml liquid volume). Light-induced proton reduction was performed by irradiating the system with a 400 nm LED panel at 1.6 mW/cm2. Headspace gas was sampled after 30 min irradiation. The net H2 turnover number (TON) are shown in FIG. 17A and FIG. 26A, for examples. FIG. 26A-B and FIG. 17A.

G. Light-Induced Redox Reaction with QDs-CL Mixture.

Here, the QDs refer to CZSI with nominal 0 to approximately 3 monolayer ZnS shells, synthesized from 3.55 nm CdS QDs, and capped with MPA ligands.

Light-induced proton reduction reaction was taken in a 2 ml vial under stirring, with a total reaction volume of 0.3 ml. The reaction phase contained 200 nM QDs, 100 mM ascorbic acid (pH 7.4) was vacuum-degassed and charged with argon (approximately 1.7 ml headspace). Anaerobically thawed cell lysate (15 μl) was swiftly injected into the vial with an air-tight syringe. The mixture was incubated at 30° C. for 10 min, followed by irradiating using a 400 nm LED panel (with −1.6 mW/cm2 at reaction site) for 30 min. The headspace gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (0.1 ml sampling) using the above-mentioned method, and as described herein. FIG. 17B.

The light-induced N2—H2O reduction was done in a similar condition, with the replacement of ascorbic acid by 300 mM HEPES and the headspace gas by UHP grade N2. H2 and NH3 were analyzed using the methods mentioned above, and as described herein, (FIG. 17C).

To evaluate how the selective binding of the His-tagged MFN to the ZnS-coated QDs would effect H2 production, the reaction was performed in media with the addition of 250 mM imidazole and with a higher acidity (pH 5.9). In both cases, the selective binding was interrupted.

The total amount of H2 produced from the QDs-cell lysate systems (xQDs-CL) was compared to the QDs (xQDs) (x=0-3 indicating the number of ZnS shells) systems. The OQDs-CL shows (FIG. 17D) a minor increase in H2 production compared to 0NP, this is due to non-selective binding (through electrostatic interactions) of the QDs to both active MoFe nitrogenase and non-active cell components. These two different bindings will either enhance or decrease H2 production due to the catalytic effects and potential surface reaction site blockage, and hence no obvious improvement in H2 generation was observed. Due to the difficulty in tunneling electrons through the thick ZnS barrier layer, 3QDs-CL also show a low H2 yield. However, a significant increase in H2 production was observed in 1 QDs-CL (by 2.9 folds) and 2QDs-CL (by 1.6 folds) compared to 1QDs and 2QDs, respectively, with the highest rate of H2 production being 3467 nmol/ml CL/h for 2QDs-CL. The improvement in H2 yield could be due to the site-selective His-tagged MFN to the QDs zinc-rich surface binding, which was also confirmed by control experiments, with the addition of imidazole (at a high concentration of 250 mM, pH 7.4) or using a higher acidity (pH 5.9) environment. Such selective binding is prevented by either competitive imidazole-zinc coordination or the protonation of histidine, and as expected, no improvement in H2 production was seen between xQDs-CL and xQDs ((FIG. 17E-F.

For the light-induced dinitrogen-water reduction with QDs:cell lysate biohybrids, both H2 and NH3 were generated (FIG. 17). Similar to the proton reduction, a significant increase of H2 and NH3 yield was observed in 1 QDs-CL and 2QDs-CL systems, with maximum H2 and NH3 production rates of 1587 and 693 nmol/ml CL/h for 2QDs-CL. No improvement of H2 generation was observed in 0 QDs-CL and 3QDs-CL. The difference of 1:2 in the ratio of H2 to NH3 is probably due to direct proton reduction from the QDs to the biohybrids.

### VI. Interactions Between QDs and the Living Bacteria.

In this section, and as described herein, cellular uptake (elemental analysis and confocal microscopy) and a series of viability tests (cell growth assay, resazurin dye assay, CFU assay) were performed to study the interactions between the QDs (CZSI with nominal 2ML ZnS shell, if not specified) and the bacteria cells (A. vinelandii and C. necator). Nitrogen-free Burk media or photocatalytic media (35 mM HEPES and 5 to approximately 25 mM L-ascorbic acid, pH=7.4) were used for A. vinelandii test, and minimal salt media (MSM) was used for C. necator test.

A. Cellular QDs Uptake Assay.

A. vinelandii DJ995 cells were collected at mid-log phase (OD600 approximately 1.0) and washed twice with ASC5 media (35 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-ascorbic acid, pH=7.4). Mixture with 200 nM MPA, CYS, or CA-coated QDs and OD6oo approximately 1.0 bacteria cells in ASC5 media (total volume 200 μl) were incubated at 30° C. for 30 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 6,000 rpm and the cell pellets were quickly washed with ASC5 media (0.5 ml, twice) and finally re-suspended in 0.5 ml ASC5 media. The amount of Cd (in ppb) is measured by ICP-MS. The Cd level in the QDs suspension (1, 10, 100, 1000 nM) was also measured. A calibration curve was used to correlate the QDs concentration (in nM) to the Cd level (in ppb).

The QDs uptake (FIG. 2F) is calculated by counting the percentage of QDs (in numbers) consumed by the cells:

QDs uptake (%)=ICP−MS measured QDs concentration×500×100%

**Initial QDs Concentration ×200**

B. Laser-Scanning Confocal Microscopy.

A. vinelandii cells were taken from growth media and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 2 min, washed twice with 25 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same HEPES buffer to an OD of 0.1. MPA-capped CZSe were added to cells in HEPES buffer for a final concentration of 250 nM. The QDs-cell mixture was vortexed briefly and placed in a shaker at 37° C. and 225 rpm for one hour. The mixture was then centrifuged, washed with HEPES buffer three times, resuspended to an OD of 0.1, and deposited into a well-plate treated with poly-L-lysine. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, after which the wells were rinsed twice with DI water. 0.1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde solution was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 10 min at room temperature. After fixation, wells were rinsed with DI water twice and evacuated of liquid prior to imaging. Samples were imaged using Nikon AIR laser scanning confocal microscope with immersion oil and a 100× oil objective. Z-scan images were taken using a step-size of 0.25 m with an x-y resolution of 200 nm.

Confocal images were recorded (FIG. 18A-L) to provide direct evidence that CZSe3 penetrate and reside within the cells after incubation. Bright emission was seen under TRITC laser, with the general shape corresponding to the profile of the cell, indicating the internalized CZSe3 QDs. 3D single cell rendering with several Z-scan images of the same cell (from the focal plane at the bottom of the cell to the top) demonstrate that the QDs are internalized into A. vinelandii cells instead of aggregating on the cell membrane. Internalization of the other QDs used in this study is feasible, considering their smaller sizes compared to CZSe3 QDs.

FIG. 18A also depicts a large cluster of cells in transmission mode with no excitation. When the same cluster is illuminated with TRITC laser, the internalized CZSe3 show bright emission (FIG. 18B and FIG. 18C), which take on the general shape of the cells within the cluster. Further evidence of QD internalization is demonstrated in the 3D rendering of a single cell (FIG. 18D) where the QDs occupy the full volume of the cell. Several Z-scan images of the same cell are shown in FIG. 18E-L) where FIG. 18E begins with the focal plane at the bottom of the cell and ends at the top (FIG. 18L). These series of images demonstrate that the A. vinelandii cells are capable of internalizing CZSe3. Internalization of the other QDs used in this study is feasible, considering CZSe3 have the largest diameter.

C. Photocatalytic Reaction for Nanoparticle-Cell Lysate (NP-CL) Biohybrid.

Photocatalytic proton reduction reaction was taken in a 2 ml vial under stirring, with a total reaction volume of 0.3 ml. The reaction phase contained 200 nM nanoparticles, 100 mM ascorbic acid (pH 7.4) was vacuum-degassed and charged with argon (−1.7 ml headspace). Anaerobically thawed cell lysate (15 ul) was swiftly injected into the vial with an air-tight syringe. The mixture was incubated at 30° C. for about 5 min, followed by irradiating using a 400 nm LED panel (with about 1.6 mW/cm2 at reaction site) for 30 min. The headspace gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (0.1 ml sampling) using the method mentioned above. Reaction media with the addition of 250 mM imidazole and with higher acidity (pH=5.9) were also used.

Photocatalytic N2 reduction was taken in a similar condition, with the replacement of ascorbic acid by 300 mM HEPES and the headspace gas by UHP grade N2. H2 and NH3 were analyzed using the methods mentioned herein.

The total amount of hydrogen produced from nanoparticle-cell lysate systems (xNP-CL) was compared with the nanoparticle- (xNP) systems (x=0˜3 indicating the number of ZnS shells. The ONP-CL shows (FIG. 27a) a minor increase of hydrogen production compared to ONP due to non-selective binding of nanoparticles to both active MoFe nitrogenase and non-active cell components through electrostatic interactions. These two different bindings will enhance and decrease hydrogen production due to catalytic effects and surface reaction site blocking, respectively, and hence no obvious improvement of Ff2 generation. And due to the difficulty of electron tunneling through the thick ZnS barrier layer for electron injection to MoFe nitrogenase, 3NP-CL also shows low hydrogen yield. On the other hand, a significant increase of hydrogen production was observed in 1NP-CL (by 2.9 folds) and 2NP-CL (by 1.6 folds) compared to 1NP and 2NP, respectively. The highest Ff2 generation rate reaches 3467 nmol/ml CL/h in 2NP-CL. Site-selective binding of His-tagged MoFe nitrogenase on the zinc-rich surface could be one explanation of this high yield. Control experiments with imidazole addition (at a high concentration of 250 mM, pH=7.4) or using higher acidity (pH=5.9) environment were performed. Imidazole could competitively bind to zinc and block the available sites for histidine attachment. In lower pH media, histidine is protonated and not able to coordinate with zinc. And as expected, in both cases no change of hydrogen production (FIG. 27b, FIG. 27c) between xNP-CL and xNP was observed.

In the case of dinitrogen reduction with MoFe nitrogenase, both H2 and NH3 were generated (FIG. 28A-B). Similar to proton reduction, a significant increase of H2 and NH3 yield was observed in 1 NP-CL and 2NP-CL, with maximum hydrogen and ammonia production rate of 1587 and 693 nmol/ml CL/h in 2NP-CL. And no improvement of hydrogen yield was observed in ONP-CL and 3NP-CL. Compared to the enzymatic dinitrogen reduction with MoFe nitrogenase, the deviation of H2 to NH3 ratio from 1:2 is probably due to direct hydrogen generation from nanoparticles.

D. Cell Growth Curve Measurement.

For the following test using living cells, if not specified, the nanoparticles refer to CdS@ZnS nanoparticles with nominal two-monolayer ZnS shell (CZS). The photocatalytic media refers to 35 mM HEPES buffer (pH=7.4) with 5, 10 or 25 mM L-ascorbic acid (ASC5, ASC10, and ASC25, respectively) as sacrificial hole quencher.

Cell growth measurement was performed in either Burk media or photocatalytic media (PCM), with a variation of QDs (nanoparticle) capping ligands (MPA, CYS, and CA) and concentration (50, 100, 200, 500, 750, and 1000 nM). A. vinelandii DJ995 bacteria grown in nitrogen-free Burk media were harvested at OD600 approximately 1.0 (mid-log phase) and washed twice and re-suspended in the Burk media or photocatalytic media. The cell growth curve (by measuring the optical density at 590 nm) was taken in the 96 well microplate (30° C., vigorous shaking) and monitored using a microplate reader (TECAN GENios) controlled by Megellan 7.2 software. Cells treated with QDs in photocatalytic media followed by growing in nitrogen-free Burk media were also tested to evaluate their viability after QDs treatment. The cells were first incubated in photocatalytic media (with QDs) for two hours (either in the dark or under 1.6 mW/cm2, 400 nm irradiation), followed by washing and re-suspending in Burk media for the growth. For all these cell growth measurements, the initial cell OD600 is 0.1.

The inhibition of cell growth indicates the QDs toxicity, which is strongly ligand-dependent (FIG. 18A-D. While MPA- or CA-capped CZS show significant inhibition of cell growth, no such inhibition was seen with CYS-capped CZS. And a decrease of cell toxicity was observed with ZnS shell, as shown in the decrease of cell growth inhibition with CYS-coated CZS (FIG. 18B) compared to CYS-capped CdS QDs (FIG. 18D). The ZnS shell could possibly prevent the leakage of Cd2+ ions from the CdS cores and hence reduce their toxicity.

No cell growth was observed (FIG. 18E-F in the photocatalytic media (non-growing media). The bacteria stay dormant and can (partially) resume growth once re-suspended in Burk media, as seen in FIG. 18G-L.

Cell treatment in the dark revealed the capping ligand-dependent cell viability. While no remarkable cell viability loss was seen with MPA or CYS-capped QDs, a decrease of cell viability was observed with CA-coated QDs at higher concentration (small decrease at 500 nM and a complete cease of cell growth at 750 or 1000 nM). This indicates that dark cytotoxicity is very low for MPA or CYS-capped QDs, where the nanoparticle surface is negatively charged or has zwitterion characters, respectively. On the other hand, CA-capped QDs with positive surface non-selectively bind to all cell components, showing high cell toxicity.

The photo-toxicity of these QDs is similar to their dark toxicity. While CYS-capped QDs show no loss of cell viability up to 1000 nM, some cell viability loss was observed with a high concentration (750 and 1000 nM) MPA-capped QDs treatment. And almost complete ceasing of cell growth in higher concentration CA-capped QDs demonstrates their high toxicity.

D. Resazurin Dye Cell Viability Assay.

Cell viability assay was performed in a 96 well microplate using resazurin dye as an indicator. The bacteria cells (OD600 approximately 1.0) were for two hours treated QDs in the dark or under light (1.6 mW/cm2, 400 nm irradiation) irradiation, followed by washing (twice) and re-suspended in the nitrogen-free Burk media (OD600=1.0), as mentioned in the cell growth curve measurements. Resazurin was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the fluorescence (excited at 485 nm) was measured at 620 nm using the microplate reader.

As shown in FIG. 20A, FIG. 33 and FIG. 34A-C, no dark toxicity was seen with MPA and CYS-capped QDs up to 1000 nM.

For CA-capped QDs, cell toxicity was initially seen at 500 nM, and complete loss of cell viability was observed with higher concentrations (750 and 1000 nM). Compared with cell treatment in different media charged with or without CYS-coated nanoparticles (500 nM), a very small decrease of cell viability is shown. Furthermore, cell treatment (without nanoparticles) in different media shows no statistical loss of cell viability with ASC5 and ASC10 compared to cells without treatment (directly growth in Burk media). With L-ascorbic acid at higher concentration (25 mM), a small inhibition effect was observed.

Conclusions obtained from cells treated with QDs (nanoparticles) under light irradiation (FIG. 20D-F) (FIG. 21D-F) are similar to the correspondent cell growth curve measurement (FIG. 19A-L), where CYS-capped QDs show non-toxic characteristics and MPA-coated QDs show some toxicity at high concentration (750 and 1000 nM). For cell treatment with CA-capped QDs, significant loss of cell viability was seen even at low concentration. And compared to resazurin cell viability test with cell treatment in dark, significant decrease of cell viability starts even at low concentration CA-coated nanoparticles, while cell viability is not completely lost even at high nanoparticle concentration, as also seen in the cell growth measurement. Another interesting phenomenon is the cell treatment in different media with or without nanoparticles. While in dark condition, no different of cell viability is seen with media variation, an increase of cell viability in light irradiation condition was observed with increase L-ascorbic acid concentration. This can be explained by L-ascorbic acid as a better sacrificial agent (quencher) for holes compared to sucrose in Burk media. Under 400 nm light irradiation, the photo-generated holes, which are highly cytotoxic, can be easily quenched by L-ascorbic acid and such effect is facilitated with increasing L-ascorbic concentration. Therefore, higher cell viability was observed in ASC25 media.

E. Colony forming unit (CFU) assay.

CFU assay was also used for evaluating the cell viability. Cell cultures were collected at OD600=1.0 from nitrogen-free Burk media and washed twice with ASC5 media. Mixtures with OD600=1.0 bacteria cell, 500 nM MPA, CYS or CA-capped QDs in ASC5 media were incubated at 30° C. for 2 hours in the dark, followed by washing (twice) and re-suspending in the same amount of nitrogen-free Burk media. 10 ul of the suspension with different cell OD600s (1, 10−2, 10−4, 10−6, 10−8) was inoculated on the B-plate (nitrogen-free Burk media with agar, in a squared petri dish) and incubated under 30° C. The CFU was counted by naked eyes (FIG. 2G). CFU from OD6oo=10−4 suspension is presented in FIG. 2G, with the calculated cell viability using cells treated with no nanoparticles in ASC5 media as 100%.

Similar to the cell growth and resazurin cell viability test mentioned herein (FIG. 29-FIG. 35), with MPA and CYS-coated nanoparticles (500 nM) treatment, no decrease of CFU is seen compared to treatment in the same media (ASC5) without nanoparticles. And the highly toxic CA-coated nanoparticles render the CFU to a very low value, showing about 5% cell viability compared to no nanoparticle treatment.

F. In-Vivo Photocatalytic Ammonia and Hydrogen Generation Test.

In vivo photocatalytic reactions were conducted in either 96 well microplates or small test tubes and tested either in the air or pure dinitrogen atmosphere. The mixtures basically contain Azotobacter vinelandii DJ995 cells, nanoparticles, and photocatalytic media and were incubated at 30° C. for 30 min and 150 mixture was added to the wells and a LED panel with 400 nm emission was used to irradiate the system through the cover, in a top-down mode. Ammonia production was determined using fluorescence assay described above, with the same mixture without irradiation (dark) as a baseline. To optimize the condition for ammonia yield, variations of cell optical density (ODeoo), capping ligands of the nanoparticles, nanoparticle concentration, and irradiation intensity were used.

First, 200 nM MPA-coated nanoparticles were used in ASC5 (5 mM L-ascorbic acid, 35 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and irradiated with 400 nm light at 1.6 mW/cm2 for 1 hour. The Azotobacter vinelandii DJ995 culture from the Burk media was centrifuged at 6000 rpm and washed twice with ASC5. The cells were added to the above suspension with final OD600 from 0.1 to 1.0. The net ammonia production is shown in FIG. 36.

The ammonia production increases with cell optical density, but not linearly. As from Azotobacter vinelandii DJ995, OD6oo=1.0 is at the mid-log phase of its growth and cells will start lysing at higher density. Therefore, we will use OD6oo=1.0 for our following optimization.

With fixed cell optical density (OD6oo=1.0), the nanoparticles with different capping ligands (MPA, CYS, CA) and concentrations were used. The ammonia generation is presented in FIG. 37. For MPA and CA-coated nanoparticles, the ammonia yield increases with nanoparticle concentration and have a peak value when 200 nM nanoparticles were used. The yield then drops down with higher nanoparticle concentration. As for CYS-coated nanoparticles, ammonia production levels off at 500 nM nanoparticle concentration, with no further increase or decrease at higher concentration. This concentration and capping ligand-dependent ammonia yield can be related to varieties of factors, including the cell viability and nanoparticle uptake. To ensure high-efficiency photoelectron transfer from nanoparticles to MoFe nitrogenase, higher nanoparticle uptake is required to have more nanoparticles specifically bind to the active enzyme. Meanwhile, the cells should also be at the living condition, where oxygen in the air is consumed without diffusing into the reactive center to deactivate the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase. With the cell viability measurement (FIG. 31, FIG. 34A-C) with cells treated in photocatalytic media under irradiation, the decrease of ammonia yield at high concentration (MPA and CA-coated nanoparticles) is due to partial loss of cell viability. Though cells have very high uptake for positively charged (CA-coated) nanoparticles, high nanoparticle toxicity at an even low concentration (50 nM) is the main reason for low ammonia yield. Decent uptake and non-toxic character of CYS-coated nanoparticle ensure high ammonia yield. While at lower nanoparticle concentration (50-500 nM) where MPA and CYS-coated nanoparticles show minor loss of cell viability, higher ammonia yield with CYS-coated nanoparticles is mainly due to higher nanoparticle uptake. No further increase of ammonia yield starts beyond 500 nM with CYS-coated nanoparticles could be limited by the amount of bacteria cells.

Control experiments with the removal of some components (cells or nanoparticles) from the mixture were also taken. As shown in FIG. 38, no difference of ammonia production between dark and light. Therefore, we ruled out the possibility of ammonia generation from the bacteria cells or nanoparticles.

Irradiation intensity-dependent ammonia yield is also measured, with 500 nM CYS-coated nanoparticles and ODeoo=1-0 bacteria cells. Light intensity at reaction site from 0.16 to 2.42 mW/cm2 was used in this assay. With low irradiation intensity, the ammonia yield is low (FIG. 38) due to the limit of photo-induced electrons produced from nanoparticles. However, at high-intensity irradiation, there is a small decrease of ammonia production and this could probably be related to decreasing of cell viability under strong near-UV light irradiation. In the other tests, optimal light intensity (1.6 mW/cm2) was used.

With fixed bacteria, cell optical density (OD600=1.0) and nanoparticle concentration (200 and 500 nM), photocatalytic dinitrogen reduction was taken in the air or pure dinitrogen atmosphere. A small test tube with 150 1 mixture was sealed with a septum and for replacing air with pure dinitrogen gas, the headspace air was vacuumed and recharged with UHP grade N2 using a syringe needle connected to the Schlenk line. The vacuum degassing and N2 recharging were repeated for three cycles to ensure low 02 level in the reaction system. As shown in FIG. 11a, b, no difference of ammonia production was observed between microplate assay and test tube assay in the air, showing no dependence on ammonia production with the experimental setup. No change of ammonia yield was seen in the air or pure dinitrogen when MPA and CYS-coated nanoparticles at 200 and 500 nM were used, which indicates that nitrogen source (dinitrogen in the air or pure dinitrogen) is not a limiting factor. However, with CA-coated nanoparticles, ammonia production increases by almost one fold. This could be explained by the protection of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase under an inert atmosphere. Low cell viability in media with CA-coated nanoparticles could render the nitrogenase vulnerable to oxygen toxification as described previously. N2 protection could be the main reason in higher ammonia production and this also reflects the importance of cell viability in in-vivo light-driven air-water reduction.

With the above optimization, time-dependent ammonia production was measured using photocatalytic ASC5, ASC10, ASC25 (35 mM HEPES with 5, 10, 25 mM L-ascorbic acid, pH=7.4) and Burk media. The reaction mixture was scaled up from 150 1 to 1 ml to allow multiple sampling. The photocatalytic test was taken in a small test tube covered with aluminum foil and magnetically stirred to ensure enough air supply. 25 microliter reaction phase was sampled at certain time point for ammonia assay. As shown in FIG. 40A, net ammonia generation increases with time and levels off at about 1.5 hours for photocatalytic reaction in ASC5 and ASC10 media. Ammonia yield is lower with ASC25 media but doesn't show saturation up to 4 hours. Unlimited sacrificial agent (L-ascorbic acid) supply could be one explanation and lower cell viability in high concentration (25 mM) L-ascorbic acid can be the reason of lower ammonia production. Furthermore, total ammonia production in Burk media is half compared to ASC5 or ASC10. As from the cell growth curve (FIG. 29-FIG. 32), cells keep growing in Burk media but stay dormant in photocatalytic media. The consumption of generated ammonia could be the main reason of lower ammonia production. This phenomenon was also reported by Harwood et. al., where methane production is much higher in photo synthetic bacteria R. palustris (light-driven CO2 reduction by nitrogenase) with non-growing cells compared to growing cells.

The saturation of ammonia production could be due to depletion of the reducing agent (L-ascorbic acid or sucrose in photocatalytic or Burk media) or an increase of ammonia (inhibitor for MoFe nitrogenase) level in the reaction phase. To prove this assumption, ammonia was removed by separation the cells with centrifugation and replace the reaction phase with new media with nanoparticles every 1.5 hours. As shown from FIG. 41A, ammonia production (partially) resumed with new media, though with decreased yield, as shown in the recovery (FIG. 41b) of ammonia TON from 100% to −75% and −50% in the second and third cycle, respectively. The decrease of recovery could be caused by the loss of cells or cell viability during the long period photocatalytic reaction or with repeated centrifugation and washing.

We tested the cell-nanoparticle system in photocatalytic hydrogen production in the air atmosphere. The photocatalytic reaction (1 ml total volume) was performed in a small test tube as described above, with a rubber septum to retain the gas phase used for hydrogen quantification with gas chromatography. Headspace gas (total volume: 7 ml) was sampled at the certain time point and 0.1 ml gas was injected for hydrogen detection. Reaction phase contains 500 nM CYS-coated nanoparticles and OD6oo=LO bacteria cells in photocatalytic media (ASC5, ASC10, and ASC25). The result is presented in FIG. 42. Saturation of hydrogen production (FIG. 42a) is seen at 1.5 hours, similar to the case of ammonia production. Control experiments with complete mixture (cells with nanoparticles in ASC5 media) kept in dark and with the removal of nanoparticles do not show detectable H2 production. And with nanoparticles alone, the H2 yield is low in ASC5 media. However, with increasing L-ascorbic acid in the media (FIG. 42b), hydrogen production with nanoparticles increases and surpasses the yield with nanoparticle-cell mixture. An increase of hydrogen production with nanoparticles is due to higher quenching rate of photogenerated holes with higher concentration L-ascorbic acid. Due to low nanoparticle uptake, most of the nanoparticles will favor direct charge injection to water for hydrogen production and interaction between non-uptaken nanoparticles will, on the other hand, hamper the hydrogen generation, as shown in lower H2 yield of nanoparticle-cell compared to the nanoparticle-system in ASC25 media.

The turnover number of the ASC5-CYS500 system for ammonia and hydrogen production was calculated, taking the number of cells (4.5×108/ml×1 ml=4.5×108 at ODgoo=1.0) into account. The result is presented in FIG. 11d. Turnover frequency within 1 hour (linear accumulation of ammonia and hydrogen) was calculated to be 8.73×103 s−1 and 4.35×103 s−1 for ammonia and hydrogen generation, respectively.

### VII. Formation of QDs-Living Bacteria Nano-Biohybrid (Nanorgs) for Light-Induced Air-CO2—Water to Fuel Production.

A. Experiment and Control Groups.

The QDs-living bacteria nano-biohybrids were formed by mixing the bacteria cells with QDs in the suitable media followed by incubating at room temperature for about half an hour. Either open-air or septum-sealed reactors were used for photocatalytic air-water or CO2-water reduction tests. Typically, air-water reduction (NH3 production) using A. vinelandii was performed in either a 96 well microplate (150 ul total reaction volume, for end-point assay) or a small test tube (1 ml total reaction volume, for kinetics study). CO2-water reduction using A. vinelandii or C. necator was performed in either a 2 ml GC vial (0.3 ml total reaction volume, for end-point assay) or 30 ml septum-sealed vial (5 ml total reaction volume, for kinetics study). Experiment group for light-induced air-water reduction includes bacteria cells (OD600=1.0), 500 nM CZS QDs (CYS-capped), photocatalytic media (HEPES+L-ascorbic acid), air atmosphere, 1.6 mW/cm2 400 nm LED irradiation. For CO2-water reduction, the headspace was purged with CO2 for 15 min. Gentle agitation was applied to facilitate gas-liquid phase contact. Control groups with the removal of one or more components were used to prove the product generation from light-activated nanorgs instead of from media or contamination.

1. Plasmid Construction.

Primers were designed to amplify the efe gene with flanking Ndel and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends respectively. The efe gene from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola was synthesized by Eurofins (e.g. Eurofins Genomics LLC, Louisville Ky. 40299, USA) and was used as a template for PCR amplification utilizing exemplary primers EFEPF ′5 TTT CCC CAT ATG ATG ACC AAC CTA CAG ACT TT 3′ and EFEPR 5′ GGG AAA GGA TCC TCA TGA GCC TGT CGC GCG GG 3′. Both the efeP and YFP plasmids were constructed in the pBBR1-MCS2 backbone. The promoter from the phaC gene in C. necator was used to drive transcription of YFP (control), and the ethylene-forming enzyme (efe, from Pseudomonas syringae). The pBBRl vector was digested with Ndel and BamHI and the efe gene was ligated in to the vector downstream of the Pphac promoter, resulting in the construction of pBBRl-efe. Transformant colonies were selected on Kanamycin (50 mg/ml). Growing transformants were screened via colony PCR utilizing EFEPF and EFEPR Transformants were screened via colony PCR utilizing EFEPF and EFEPR. Sequences, plasmids, transformants, etc., were verified by Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience). Expression of EFE in C. necator was confirmed via Western blots with EFE antibody (Thermofisher).

The IPA and 2,3-BDO strains were constructed as shown in FIG. 8, and integrated into the genome of C. necator.

2. Integrated Operons of IPA and 2,3-BDO.

In one embodiment, genes were codon optimized for expression in C. necator H16 (e.g. strain). In one embodiment, bktB(β-ketothiolase, H16_A1445) is native; ctfAB(Succinyl-CoA transferase, AJ000086) from H. pylori, adc(acetoacetate decarboxylase, CA_P0165) from C. acetobutylicum, sadh(secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, AAA23199.2) from C. beijerinckii, alsS(acetolactate synsthase, BSU36010) and alsD(acetolactate decarboxylase, BSU36000) from B. subtilis. pBAD promoter with araC gene was obtained from pCM291rfp plasmid (1) The operons were integrated by a two step homologous recombination using sacB as the selection marker as described previously (2, S11) replacing the native PHB operon (phaCAB).

Primers used for plasmid construction are shown in Table S6. Genes were assembled using the USER assembly method, with the USER cloning kit (New England Biolabs, NEB).

Briefly, a suicide vector pL03(J) (Ref 3) was used for gene deletion and integration. 700 bp upstream of phaC and downstream sequence of phaBl genes were used as homologous regions. The IPA1 and BD2 operons were cloned in between the homologous arms. Alternatively, operons starting from the rrnB T2 terminator were cloned in between the homologous arms.

Suicide vectors, including those described; designed and constructed herein, were transformed via conjugation using E. coli S-17 cells carrying the desired vector and C. necator strains using the protocol described herein and in (Reference (Ref.) No. 2).

Conjugation was performed by transformation of the IPA1 and BD2 suicide plasmids into the mobilizing strain S-17 E. coli followed by incubation of the transformed cells overnight with C. necator on LB, followed by selection on LB+15 μl gentamicin (to select against S-17 cells) and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. In some embodiments, transconjugants were selected on minimal media plates with 0.4% fructose and appropriate antibiotics.

A second recombination step was carried out by inoculating single colonies from the first cross-over into low salt LB medium with 15% sucrose without antibiotics overnight. Sucrose resistant colonies were plated onto low salt LB agar plates with 15% sucrose and then single colonies were selected for further screening. Colonies which did not exhibit antibiotic resistance were selected and successful integration of the IPA1 and BD2 operons was confirmed via PCR, utilizing primers flanking upstream and downstream of the homologous sequences. In some embodiments, colonies which did not exhibit antibiotic resistance were selected and successful integration or gene deletions were analyzed using PCR with primers flanking upstream and downstream of the chosen homologous sequences.

Integration of both the IPA1 and BD2 operons and subsequent deletion of the PHB1 operon was confirmed using Sanger sequencing (Eurofins genomics GmbH). Integration or gene deletions were also confirmed using Sanger sequencing (Eurofins genomics GmbH).

For production of the methyl ketones, the plasmid pJM20 was conjugated into C. necator as detailed in Muller et. al., (Ref 33, and as described herein).

3. Transformation of C. necator.

In preferred embodiments, plasmids were transformed into C. necator by electroporation. However, it is not meant to limit the method of transformation. As one example, both the pBBR1 efep and pBBR1 YFP plasmids were transformed into C. necator by electroporation. Cells were made competent by growing a 10 ml overnight culture in SOB (Hannahan's broth) media in a Falcon™ tube at 30° C. at 200 rpm with 10 μg/ml gentamycin. The overnight culture was then used to inoculate a 50 ml culture to an OD600 of 0.05 with 10 μg/ml gentamycin in SOB media and incubated at 30° C. at 200 rpm until they reached an OD600 of 0.3-0.4. Cells were then washed three times with 10 ml ice cold 1 mM HEPES at 4° C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4° C. The cells were resuspended in 200 ul of 1 mM HEPES. 100-500 ng of pBBRl-efe was added to 100 μl of competent cells in a pre-chilled electroporation cuvette and left on ice for 5 minutes. Electroporation was performed at 2.5 kV, 200Q and 25 uF by a Bio-Rad gene pulser. After electroporation, 0.9 ml SOC media was added to the cells and the cells were transferred to an eppendorf tube and incubated at 30° C. at 200 rpm for 2 hours for outgrowth. After 2 hours of outgrowth dilutions of cells were plated onto LB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics (300 μg/ml kanamycin in the case of pBBRl-efe) and incubated at 30° C. Transformants appear after 48 hours and were confirmed by amplification of the efe gene by colony PCR.

4. Ethylene Measurements to Confirm Productivity in pBBR1 Efe.

The pBBR1 efe strain was tested for ethylene production using gas chromatography (GC). A single colony was used to inoculate liquid FGN medium, supplemented with 300 μg/mL kanamycin and the cultures was grown for 24 hrs at 30° C. Cultures were then diluted to an OD600 nm of 0.08 in 10 mL fresh FGN medium supplemented with kanamycin (300 ug/ml). 3 mL aliquots were grown overnight in triplicate in 10 mL rubber-capped GC serum bottles at 30° C., 200 rpm. 2 mL of the headspace was collected with a gas syringe after 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs and analyzed using a Trace™ 1300 gas chromatograph (Thermo Scientific™) under the following conditions: column size: 0.53 mm×40 mm; solid phase: Porapak N column; column temperature: 60° C.; carrier gas: helium and detector: TCD. OD values were determined using a spectrophotometer set at the wavelength λ=600 nm. Ethylene production peaked at 24 hours at 300 nmol/OD600/mL ethylene. No ethylene was detected in the control strain pBBR1YFP.

5. Analytical Methods to Confirm Productivity in C. necator IPA1 and BD2.

The C. necator IPA-1 and BD2 strains were both cultivated in minimal media with a C:N (carbon to nitrogen) of 60 (mol C/mol N), utilising fructose as the sole carbon source to induce the stringent response in 50 ml shake flasks at 200 rpm, 30° C. L-Arabinose was added at a final concentration of 1 g/L (0.1% w/v) to the cultures for IPA-1 and BD2 gene induction. Supernatants from the cultivations were obtained by centrifuging the culture samples for 5 min at 13000 rpm. R,R-2,3-BDO and isopropanol were analysed using HPLC with Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.), 5 mM H2SO4 as mobile phase, equipped with UV and RI detectors. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL/min with a column temperature of 50° C. Quantifications were performed from the standard curves obtained using standards purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Biomass growth was quantified based on optical density measurement at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. R, R-2, 3-BDO was produced at 0.045 g/L in the BD2 strain and isopropanol was produced at 0.11 g/L in the IPA-1 strain. No R, R-2, 3-BDO and isopropanol could be detected in the control strains.

6. Dark Vs. Light Test.

Control tests were performed with the removal of light irradiation. The lack of any detectable levels of NH3, H2, HCOOH, PHB, C2H4, IPA, or BDO demonstrates that these products were not generated from the natural metabolism of the bacteria. It also rules out the possibility of any organic compounds (HEPES, L-ascorbic acid, etc.) acting as a source for product generation.

7. Photocatalytic Test with Bacteria Cells or QDs.

Control tests carried out with either no QDs or no bacteria cells showed negligible (FIG. 21A, 21B) amounts of NH3 or C2H4 production.

8. Photocatalytic Test in an Argon Atmosphere.

To further clarify the origin of the nitrogen and carbon in the NH3 and C2H4 products, the same tests were performed in an argon atmosphere instead of air or CO2. The cell cultures (A. vinelandii or C. necator) were bubbled with argon for 1-2 hours to remove any remaining intracellular nitrogen or CO2 gas. The collected cells were washed twice and suspended in argon-purged reaction media. The photocatalytic reactions were carried out in the same condition in a septum-sealed vial with argon headspace. No NH3 or C2H4 was detected up to 3 hours and 48 hours, respectively (FIG. 4C, FIG. 21C, 21D). This further proves that the nitrogen and carbon in the generated NH3 or C2H4 is limited to coming from air and CO2 instead of from the reaction media or other contaminants.

9. Photocatalytic Test with the Microparticles.

To prove our assumption that the photocatalytic air-water and CO2-water reduction reaction was performed intracellularly, we compared the parallel tests using the sub-5 nm QDs (q-CZS and q-CZSe, as used in the experiment groups) and their bulk counterpart (b-CZS and b-CZSe, acting as the control groups) for both NH3 and C2H4 generation. Bulk CdS was synthesized using chemical precipitation method with 0.1 M CdCl2 and 0.1 M Na2S solution. Similarly, bulk CdSe was synthesized with CdCl2 and Na2SSeO3 (by dissolving Se powder in hot Na2S2O3 solution). The b-CZS and b-CZSe were synthesized by coating two monolayer ZnS on the bulk CdS or CdSe with SILAR. Photocatalytic tests were done with replacement of 500 nM QDs with 0.2 mg/ml b-CZS or b-CZSe. No or negligible production of NH3 or C2H4 indicates the necessity of intracellular coupling of QDs with related enzymes for catalytic fuel generation.

10. Photocatalytic Test with the Addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP).

To prove the direct electron transfer from the QDs to MFN (in A. vinelandii) or hydrogenase (in C. necator) to initiate the air-water or CO2-water reduction reaction, instead of an indirect, ATP-dependent NADPH-mediated process, control experiments with the addition of ionosphere (DNP) at different concentration were conducted (S12, 34). Ionophores can disrupt the cell membrane potential and inhibit the formation of ATP, thus blocking the NH3 or C2H4 generation under natural production conditions (with consumption of sugar). We have observed (FIG. 4d, FIG. 21E, F) continuous NH3 and C2H4 generation even with a high concentration (0.5 mM) of 2,4-DNP, which demonstrates the direct electron injection-driven production.

11. Photocatalytic Tests with Different Bacteria Strains.

To further prove photocatalytic product generation, we compared different strains of A. vinelandii and C. necator, where the control groups have different metabolic pathways resulting in much lower or no desired product generation. For NH3 production, A. vinelandii DJ1003 strain (same as DJ995 but also contains an insertion and deletion mutation within nifB) was used as a control, the strain produces apo-nitrogenase (lack of MoFe cofactor) with a low or no nitrogen fixation capability (urea as a nitrogen source is hence required in the culture). The same test was conducted within 2-hours and resulted in trace amounts of NH3 generation (FIG. 4A), which could come from the urea residue. Similarly, wild-type C. necator (PHB producing, pBBRl-yfp) strain showed no C2H4 generation in the same test compared to the genetically engineered C2H4 producing strain (pBBRl-efe).

To prove the effects of zinc-histidine binding in in vivo ammonia production, nanorgs made from A. vinelandii DJ995 and A. vinelandii Wards42 (produces a nitrogenase without histidine tag) with CdS (without ZnS shell) and CZS (with two-monolayer ZnS shell) were also tested. As shown in FIG. 4b, without site-specific zinc-histidine coupling, ammonia yield is ⅓ to approximately ½ compared to the case with such binding.

12. 13C Isotope Labeling Tests.

13C isotope labeling tests were used to further prove biofuel production from inorganic 13CO2. The tests were performed similar to the other nanorg tests, with the replacement of non-labeled CO2 with 13C-bicarbonate. Typically, 20 mM NaH13CO3 were supplied, with headspace charged with argon. Headspace gas was monitored using a mass spectrometer (Balzers Prisma QME-200) with QUADSTAR software. The fragments (m/q=30 and 47 for 13C2H4+ and 13C2H5O+, respectively, FIG. 21G-I) indicate the production of ethylene and isopropanol with their corresponding nanorgs from 13CO2.

B. Experimental Parameter Optimization for Improving Product Yield.

The efficiency for in vivo photocatalytic air-water or CO2-water reduction using the QDs-living bacteria biohybrid (nanorgs) depends on many factors. These factors can be briefly classified as the intrinsic QDs part (light absorption, electronic transport, etc.), intrinsic living bacteria part (enzymatic activity, etc.), and the interactions between them (electronic coupling, cellular toxicity, etc.). Experimentally, factors including QDs surface functioning, QDs concentration, bacteria cell optical density, use of electron donor, irradiation intensity, etc. can be varied to obtain optimal product generation. The optimization was performed on NH3 producing strains with nanorgs prepared from CZS1 QDs and A. vinelandii DJ995 bacterial cells. The results can guide the optimization of other QDs and bacteria strains for other fuel production.

1. Bacteria Cell Optical Density.

Firstly, in one embodiment, mixtures with variations in cell optical density (OD600=0.1 to approximately 1.0) were tested, with 200 nM MPA-capped QDs in ASC5 media. Photocatalytic reactions were performed in air, with 400 nm light irradiation at 1.6 mW/cm2 for 1 hour. As shown in FIG. 22A, NH3 production increases with optical cell density, but not linearly. Optical density of 1.0 was used for further tests.

2. QDs Capping Ligands and QDs Concentration.

With fixed cell optical density (OD600=1.0), QDs with different capping ligands (MPA, CYS, CA) and concentrations were tested. As presented in FIG. 22B, MPA and CA-capped QDs show a small increase of NH3 yield with concentration (<200 nM) but drop down with higher QDs concentration (>500 nM). For CYS-capped QDs, a significant NH3 production was observed with no further decrease at higher concentration. And generally, CYS-capped QDs show much higher NH3 production compared to MPA and CA-capped QDs. This concentration and capping ligand-dependent NH3 yield can be explained by the QDs uptake and cell viability. The cell viability-dependent NH3 production is also demonstrated by performing the same tests in a pure nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in FIG. 22C-D, no change of NH3 yield was seen when performing the assay in air or pure dinitrogen using MPA and CYS-capped QDs, which indicates that the nitrogen source (dinitrogen in the air or pure dinitrogen) is not a limiting factor. For CA-capped QDs, a significant decrease of NH3 yield was observed when the same test was performed in air and compared to pure dinitrogen. This could be explained by the cell viability loss with CA-capped QDs, where the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase is no longer protected by the bacteria cell, leading to a lower NH3 yield.

3. Irradiation Intensity.

NH3 production with varying light intensity (from 0.16 to 2.42 mW/cm2 at reaction site) was also tested (500 nM CYS-capped QDs and OD600=1.0 bacteria cells, 1 hour irradiation time).

Low NH3 yield with low irradiation intensity is (FIG. 22E) due to the limitation of photo-induced electrons produced from QDs. On the other hand, a small decrease of NH3 production with high-intensity irradiation could probably be related to the decrease of cell viability under strong near-UV light irradiation. In other tests, optimal light intensity (1.6 mW/cm2) was used. To further investigate the evolution of NH3 with time under different light intensity irradiation (0.67 and 1.6 mW/cm2), the NH3 production was monitored using both high and low photon flux. Though the generation of NH3 is slower with lower light irradiation (FIG. 22), (FIG. 22F), the total NH3 reached similar level after 4 hours. On the other hand, NH3 production with high-intensity irradiation leveled off within 2 hours, and the accumulation of NH3 (reaching the tolerance of this bacteria strain) can explain this saturation.

4. Effect of the Electron Donor.

To investigate the function of the sacrificial quencher (L-ascorbic acid, and sulfide here), we performed the same photocatalytic test in the different medias or buffers, (e.g. HEPES buffer ((e.g. 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer)), MOPS (e.g. 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) buffer, PIPES (e.g. 1,4-Piperazinediethanesulfonic acid) buffer, PBS) with the removal of L-ascorbic acid, using the optimized CYS-capped QDs at 500 nM for 2 hours. As shown in FIG. 22G, lack of any sacrificial quencher, meant the NH3 TON is about half compared to the same test in ASC5 or HEPES-S media. Furthermore, no significant difference in NH3 yield was detected in different quencher-free medias. This could be explained by the sacrificial agent and its ability to facilitate electron injection to MFN and thus maintain cell viability.

To further understand the function of the sacrificial donor in photocatalytic NH3 production, the time evolution of NH3 was monitored in the media (HEPES) with or without the ascorbic acid. Interestingly, the total amount of NH3 in the two tests reached the same level (FIG. 4e, FIG. 22H) regardless the existence of quencher after 3-hour reaction, which ruled out the necessity of using sacrificial quencher in photocatalytic NH3 production. On the other hand, faster NH3 generation (till the saturation point) was observed with the addition of ascorbic acid, which can be attributed to faster/easier hole removal (and hence facilitate electron transfer from the QDs to the nitrogenase). Overall, the sacrificial donor could have a more pronounced effect on reaction kinetics rather than thermodynamics.

Similar tests were also performed in Burk media and photocatalytic media supplied with 5, 10, and 25 mM L-ascorbic acid (ASC5, ASC10, and ASC25). As shown in FIG. 22I, FIG. S11I, NH3 generation increases with time and levels off at 1.5 hours in ASC5 and ASC10 media. NH3 yield is lower with ASC25 media but shows no saturation up to 4 hours, which can be explained by the lower cell viability due to L-ascorbic acid inhibition (lower yield) and the unlimited sacrificial hole quencher supply (no saturation). Furthermore, total ammonia production in Burk media is halved compared to ASC5 or ASC10 in the photocatalytic media. The growing cells (in Burk media) consumed the ammonia produced in the reaction resulting in lower photocatalytic ammonia production compared to the non-growing cells in the photocatalytic media. This phenomenon was also reported by Harwood et al., where methane production by photosynthetic bacteria R. palustris (light-driven CO2 reduction by nitrogenase) is much higher with non-growing cells compared to growing cells33.

C. Recovery Tests.

The saturation of NH3 production could be due to the depletion of the sacrificial hole quencher (L-ascorbic acid) or the accumulation of NH3 (an inhibitor for MoFe nitrogenase) in the reaction phase. To prove this hypothesis, the bacteria cells were separated by centrifugation and recharged with new QDs-containing media for photocatalytic reaction every 1.5 hours. Taking the cell loss due to centrifugation, the cell OD were re-measured before each cycle, and the NH3 TON and recovery were normalized to the corrected cell OD (measured OD for the three cycles were 1.00, 0.728, and 0.565, respectively). NH3 production was resumed after each cycle, and no obvious yield loss was seen (almost 100% recovery as shown in FIG. 23). This indicates that the reduction in the NH3 production is due to the accumulation of NH3 (as nitrogenase inhibitor), this could be resolved by using a continuous flow reactor or though constructing high NH3 tolerant strains.

D. Extension to Other QDs and Bacteria Strains for Other Solar Fuel Production.

The knowledge obtained from the optimization of NH3 production can be utilized to conduct other nanorgs tests with different combinations of QDs and bacteria strains, with the benefits of extending the light absorption spectra from near-UV, to visible, to near-IR using different QDs or different excitation sources, and obtain different fuels using different genetically modified strains. Some of the results are presented in FIG. 5 and FIG. 24.

E. Estimation of the Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE).

The internal quantum efficiency (IQE), defined as the ratio of electron production to the total amount of photon absorbed, was estimated based on some of the following parameters:


- a. NH₃ and H₂ turnover frequency: 8730 and 4350 s⁻¹, respectively.
- b. CZS QDs: 500 nM concentration (c), the extinction coefficient at
  418 nm ε(418)=385676 M⁻¹cm⁻¹ and from the UV-VIS of CZS QDs,
  ε(400)/ε(418)=0.85. Therefore, ε(400)=327825 M⁻¹cm⁻¹.
- c. Cell OD₆₀₀=1.0, corresponding to 4.5×10⁸ cell/ml for *Azotobacter
  vinelandii.*
- d. Light source: 400 nm LED, with 1.6 mW/cm² irradiation intensity
  (I).
- e. Reactor: a glass vial with ˜ 1 cm inner diameter (d), with total
  reaction volume (V) of 1 ml. Therefore, the irradiation cross section
  S=πd²/4=0.52 cm² and the light path b=V/S=1.91 cm.
- f. The cellular uptake of the CZS QDs is 14%.

Based on the Lambert-Beer's law, the light absorbed A=ε(400)bc=0.313, and the transmittance and can be calculated by A=2−log(% T), and T=48.6% and the absorbed part is 1−T=51.4%.

The incident photon number can be calculated from the irradiation intensity:

\(N = {\frac{{total}\mspace{14mu}{energy}}{{photon}\mspace{14mu}{energy}} = {\frac{{intensity}*{area}*{time}}{{hc}/\lambda} = \frac{ISt}{{hc}/\lambda}}}\)

And the incident photon flux (Finc=N/t) is Finc=ISλ/hc=1.676×1014 s−1.

The absorbed photon by the nanorgs is Fabs=Finc×(1−T)×uptake=1.2×1014 s−1.

The total electrons produced from the nanorgs can be calculated from the TOF of NH3 (3 electrons per NH3 molecule) and H2 (2 electrons per H2 molecule), and for one cell, the electron flux is Fe/cell=3×TOF(NH3)+2×TOF(H2)=34890 s−1.

With OD600=1.0 cell in 1 ml total volume, the total electron flux is Fe=1.5×1013 s−1.

Therefore, IQE=Fe/Fabs×100%=13.1%.

F. Scaled-Up PHB Production in a Photobioreactor.

To investigate the scaling up of solar-biofuel production, the nanorg test scale was amplified from 5 ml to several liters. The scaled-up production was conducted in a benchtop bioreactor (BioFlo/CelliGen 115). The fermentation (approximately 4 L) was conducted in the MSM media with 200 nM Cys-capped QDs (CZS2 in this case). Wild-type C. necator pBBRl-yfp strain obtained from FGN media (OD600 between 2 and 3) was washed twice with MSM media and re-suspended in the fermentation media with an initial OD600 of 1.695. The media was flushed with CO2/O2 mixture (4:1, 0.5 SLPM (standard litre per minute)) for 15 min before irradiation. The temperature was maintained at 30° C., and the agitation was kept at 200 rpm. The pH was monitored during the whole process (approximately 6.0), and CO2/O2 was recharged every 12 hours. Five 400 nm LED panels (2 on the side wall and 3 at the bottom) were used as irradiation source. The fermentation was stopped after 68 hours, and the nanorgs were collected using centrifugation (7,000 rpm). After washing twice with D.I. water, PHB from the nanorgs was extracted with sodium hypochlorite/chloroform mixture (35) and the chloroform layer obtained from centrifugation was pulled to 70% methanol for precipitating the PHB, which were collected and dried in 70° C. overnight. The whole process was shown in FIG. 24. The dry PHB, fermentation samples before and after irradiation were subjected for GC (gas chromatograph) analysis to evaluate the recovery and purity of the PHB. Here, we obtained a total of 1.0 gram of PHB, with purity of approximately 88% (GC analysis). GC analysis of the cells yields a total PHB of 637.5 mg and 1105 mg before and after irradiation (recovery approximately 80%), indicating a net 467.5 mg production of PHB (converting CO2 to PHB with light-activated nanorgs). Using the PHB solution (dissolved in glacial acetic acid with gentle heating), we have demonstrated the use of PHB for making a plastic thin film with simple casting.

For scaling up the process for commercial production, our process in lab scale (several liters) is amenable to a pilot scale plant (approximately 1000 L), and eventually even to a commercial level (>40,000 L) with little change of the configuration. The cells with biofuel or bioproduct can simply be filtered using commercial membranes, reuse the buffered water, and simply lyse the cells using detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate) solution, followed by a charged filtration membrane to capture/recycle all the QDs (due to their surface charge). Once QDs are filtered, the remaining solution with biodegradable plastic, biofuel, or other specialty chemicals as bioproducts can be precipitated (as depicted in FIG. 6) to obtain the final product, and then packaged/formed into a product, to directly convert CO2 into fuels/biodegradable plastics.

VIII. Quantum Dot-Azotobacter vinelandii Living Nano-Biohybrid Organisms Cause Light-Driven Air-Water Reduction: Solar-Powered Living Factories.

Many naturally occurring and synthetic bacteria can accomplish industrially relevant reactions, like, for e.g., conversion of nitrogen to ammonia in ambient conditions, using chemical energy to generate electrons and reduce readily available chemical feedstocks, and can be labeled as living factories. Refs. 1-6 However, they derive the chemical energy needed sometimes from valuable food stocks, thereby reducing their attraction for energy conversion to useful solar or biofuels. Inorganic photocatalysts directly derive energy from sunlight to generate photoelectrons for reduction of inexpensive and abundant chemical feedstocks like, for e.g., air, water, and carbon-dioxide, but their lack of selectivity, low efficiency, and sometimes use of conditions such as high-temperature and pressure limit their widespread application. Refs. 7-18.

Combining these desired functionalities of direct stimuli-activations via light, voltage, or magnetic field, with the versatility of designing desired synthetic metabolic networks in living cells can provide an unprecedented platform for designing and creating multifunctional living nano-biohybrid organisms (or nanorg's), and for specific applications as living solar-powered factories for direct energy conversion to solar fuels. Ref19.

One initial step towards development of such living organisms is chemical coupling, site-specific self-assembly20-24 from dispersion, and energetic coupling between QDs and synthetic bacteria by appropriately choosing QD size and material (core-shells, if different materials required for energetic alignment and chemical coupling/biocompatibility), QD surface charge and ligands, and desired site-specific attachment. To ensure good energetic alignment and efficient electron injection from the conduction band of photoexcited QDs to molybdenum-iron nitrogenase (MFN) enzyme in Azotobacter vinelandii25 for multielectron reduction of water to hydrogen, we conducted in-situ experiments with MFN from cell-lysate with different cadmium chalcogenide QDs. Since the choice of chalcogen virtually fixes the valence band state and any change in size and therefore quantum confinement tunes the conduction band position,26 we identified different sizes of cadmium sulfide (CdS, FIG. 12a) and cadmium selenide (CdSe, FIG. 12b) QDs can energetically match the reduction potential for the MFN enzyme. Using detailed electrochemical measurements27-29 of these QDs, we identified that 3.6, 4.2, and 5.0 nm diameter CdS QDs had the desired electrochemical alignment (FIG. 9a), and while small CdSe QDs (2.3 nm) also had desired electrochemical potential, poor charge injection efficiency of photogenerated electron, strong electron-hole recombination, and smaller electron lifetime lead to lower number of photogenerated electrons from CdSe NPs to be utilized by MFN enzyme (FIG. 13A-D, 13J, 13E, 13K, 13F). Consequently, using water reduction and generation of hydrogen in these in-situ measurements, we observed much lower photocatalytic activity from these nano-biohybrids (FIG. 9b, FIG. 26A-B).

To identify suitable chemical coupling (and ensure biocompatibility, discussed later) and design site-specific attachment and self-assembly in chosen QDs, we tested large CdS and ZnS nanoparticles. These particles were suspended with cell lysate prepared from Azotobacter vinelandii DJ995 bacteria followed by separation and the resulting protein-bound particles were analyzed using gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to identify the type of enzymes attached to the nanoparticle surface (FIG. 2AB). While CdS nanoparticles showed non-specific attachment of different enzymes, ZnS nanoparticles selectively attached MFN, thereby identifying the suitable choice of material for the QD surface-MFN interaction. We synthesized CdS QDs with different ZnS shell thickness (FIG. 12C-D) and conducted in-situ testing of biohybrid formed based on the coordination between zinc ion and histidine (Histidine-tagged MFN covalently binds to the ZnS surface of the CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles) under 400 nm light irradiation. Using water reduction to hydrogen and dinitrogen-water reduction for hydrogen/ammonia production, different ZnS shell thickness demonstrated thickness-dependent photocatalytic performance. ZnS shell thickness affects the photogenerated electron transport characteristics and kinetics in CdS core. While increased shell thickness causes surface passivation to reduce surface states/defects, it also serves as a barrier for charge injection of photogenerated electron from the core. For the optimal design of biohybrid, CdS@ZnS core-shell QDs with nominal x monolayers (x=0˜3) of ZnS shell and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capping ligand were used to realize formation of MFN biohybrid in pH 7.4 media. Using our in-situ testing of hydrogen and ammonia generation under irradiation, with L-ascorbic acid or HEPES as sacrificial agent, significant enhancement of water and dinitrogen reduction (FIG. 27A, FIG. 28A-B) was observed in 1 and 2 monolayer thick ZnS shell, with maximum 615 nmol/ml cell lysate/h hydrogen generation rate in water reduction and 527/337 nmol/ml cell lysate/h hydrogen/ammonia generation rate in dinitrogen-water reduction for 2 monolayer thick CdS@ZnS QD-MFN biohybrid. As a comparison, QDs without ZnS shell MFN enzyme attachment show negligible yield. The selective binding of Ffis-tagged MFN to zinc-rich nanoparticle surface is also confirmed by control experiments (FIG. 27B, FIG. 27c), where addition of imidazole (coordinates with Zn2) or increasing media acidity (protonates histidine) inhibits such interactions and hence no hydrogen production by the biohybrid was observed (same as using QD as control). Optimal design of 2 monolayers thick CdS@ZnS QD-MFN biohybrid was also evident by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (FIG. 13I, L, G, M), small total capacitance and charge transport resistance), open-circuit potential decay (FIG. 13I, Table S4, reduced non-radiative charge recombination) and photoluminescence (FIG. 12C-D, removal of surface states), showing the importance of simultaneous optimization of surface tuning, photophysics, and charge tunneling (across QD-shell) in designing highly efficient QD-MFN biohybrids.

Another requirement for making living nano-biohybrid nanorg's was cell uptake30-33 and viability34-39 of designed QDs. An aspect of this, besides biocompatibility of ZnS coating, is the ligand and charge on QD surface. Using three-different similar-sized QD ligands with different surface charge: mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, negative charge), cysteamine (CA, positive charge) and cysteine (CYS, zwitterion), we tested cell viability of CdS@ZnS QDs using three-different methods.40-42 First, using cell growth (monitored using optical density) in the growing media (Burk media) with nanoparticles, we have observed high growth inhibition for MPA- and CA-coated nanoparticles (FIG. 10a, FIG. 29), but no such inhibition for CYS-capped QDs even at high concentrations (similar to no treatment). Under light irradiation with non-growing nanorg cells in the photocatalytic media (FIG. 31), cell viability is almost not affected with CYS-coated nanoparticles and low concentration MPA-coated nanoparticles. With higher concentration MPA-coated nanoparticles and even low (50 nM) concentration of CA-coated QDs, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed. Low cell viability renders the cell unable to remove the oxygen in the air which causes deactivation of MFN enzyme reaction center leading to low ammonia yield (confirmed by conducting the same test in pure dinitrogen atmosphere and ammonia production was increased by almost one fold with CA-coated nanoparticles, FIG. 11a, FIG. 11b). The second measure of cell viability used was resazurin dye assay, which also demonstrated high cell viability for zwitterion and negative-charged QDs (FIG. 10b, FIG. 35). A more detailed investigation with colony forming unit analysis (CFU) also showed same results (FIG. 11c), with the highest viability for zwitterion and negatively charged QDs, followed by a strong reduction in the number of viable cells with CA-coating. While the cellular uptake with positively charged CA-coated QDs was much higher than negative or zwitterions ligands with similar sizes, strong non-specific attachment of QDs to negatively-charged cell organelles (like, for e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins) could be responsible for low cell viability, especially at high CA-coated QD concentrations.

Following design and self-assembly of appropriate living QD-Azotobacter vinelandii biohybrid nanorg's (CdS@ZnS with 2 monolayer shells, with cysteine ligand coating and site-specific attachment with histidine-tagged MFN enzyme), we tested their ability to fix light-energy into specific bonds using inexpensive chemical feedstocks like, for e.g., air and water. Optimized bacteria cell optical density (FIG. 36, OD6oo=L0), QD concentration (FIG. 37), and irradiation intensity (FIG. 39, 1.6 mW/cm2) were used for tests, described herein.

While different capping ligands with CdS@ZnS QDs lead to different optimal QD concentrations for improved ammonia production (FIG. 38), due to different uptake and cell viability, the site-specific attachment of optimally designed CYS-coated CdS@ZnS (2 monolayer) QDs leads to moderate uptake compared to similar CA-capped QDs, but higher yield of ammonia generation with CYS-coated QDs (compared to MPA or CA ligands, FIG. 38), due to dual effects of cell viability and uptake with different ligand capping and resulting QD surface charge. With cysteine-coated CdS@ZnS2ML nanoparticles at 500 nM with cell optical density (OD600) at 1.0 and under 1.6 mW/cm2 400 nm light irradiation, hydrogen and ammonia production (using solar-driven air-water reduction) were also monitored in photocatalytic media with different L-ascorbic concentration (5, 10, 25 mM). The hydrogen generation (FIG. 42A-B) saturated at 1.5 hours, similar to the case of ammonia production. Comparison between photocatalytic reaction with QD and nanorg's show an interesting L-ascorbic acid concentration-dependent yield. Hydrogen production is higher with the nano-biohybrid mixture at the low L-ascorbic acid level, but surpassed by pure nanoparticles at higher L-ascorbic acid concentration, due to faster quench of photogenerated holes and decrease in cell viability with higher L-ascorbic acid concentrations. Ammonia yield (FIG. 40A) is also higher in media with lower L-ascorbic acid concentration. Turnover frequency calculated in the first 1 hour (linear accumulated of ammonia and hydrogen with time) is 8.73×103 s″1 and 4.35×103 s″1 for ammonia and hydrogen generation (in ASC5 media), respectively (FIG. 11d).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the formation of a living QD-Azotobacter vinelandii DJ995 nano-biohybrid nanorgs via the design of appropriate QDs and facile mixing, self-assembly, and site-specific attachment of desired nanorg's. Based on the success of in-vitro testing, photocatalytic living cell ammonia and hydrogen production are realized in-vivo through air-water and water reduction using light irradiation in non-growing cells. We have shown the importance of optimal QD material and size design due to alignment and charge injection of a photogenerated electron to MFN-enzyme, the function of biocompatible ZnS shell in site-specific Histidine-tagged MFN enzyme binding, charge transport tuning, CdS cytotoxicity reduction. The cysteine-coated CdS@ZnS (2 monolayers thick) QDs showed sufficient cell uptake and cell viability of nano-biohybrids, to facilitate high-efficiency and high-selectivity in-vivo photocatalytic production of ammonia and hydrogen with an optimized turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.73×103 s″1 and 4.35×103 s″1, respectively. This could pave the way of designing highly efficient solar-powered living factories for solar fuel and solar fertilizer generator, using readily available chemical feedstocks. Furthermore, this idea could be extended as a platform technology to design, synthesize, and test other engineered living nano-biohybrid systems, with different combinations of semiconductor nanomaterials and synthetic microorganisms, to harness the power of desired biological processes with multifunctional properties of designer materials like, for e.g., external stimuli-activation with light, electrical pulses, or magnetic field, to wireless communication with living cells.

### IX. Gold Nanoclusters Cause Selective Light-Driven Biochemical Catalysis in Living Nano-Biohybrid Organisms.

Living nano-biohybrid organisms or nanorgs combine the specificity and well-designed surface chemistry of an enzyme catalyst site, with the strong light absorption and efficient charge injection (for biocatalytic reaction) from inorganic materials. Previous efforts in harvesting sunlight for renewable and sustainable photochemical conversion of inexpensive feedstocks to biochemicals using nanorgs focused on the design of semiconductor nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs). However, metal nanoparticles and nanoclusters (NCs), such as gold (Au), offer strong light absorption properties and biocompatibility for potential application in living nanorgs. Here we show that optimized, sub-1 nanometer Au NCs-nanorgs can carry out selective biochemical catalysis with high turnover number (108 mol/mol of cells) and turnover frequency (>2×107 h−1). While the differences of size, light absorption, and electrochemical properties between these NCs (with 18, 22, and 25 atoms) are small, large differences in their light-activated properties dictate that 22 atom Au NCs are best suited for forming living nanorgs to drive photocatalytic ammonia production from air. Further, by comparing the light-driven ammonia production yield between strains producing Mo—Fe nitrogenase with and without histidine tags, we demonstrate that preferential coupling of Au NCs to the nitrogenase through Au-histidine interactions is crucial for effective electron transfer and subsequent product generation. Together, these results provide the design rules for forming Au NCs-nanorgs, and may have implications for carrying out light-driven biochemical catalysis for renewable solar fuel generation.

Biochemical conversion of inexpensive feedstocks like, for e.g., air, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2) into desired chemicals and fuels offers specificity and low cost, but typically requires energetic substrates such as sugar to supply the energy required for conversion. Inorganic catalysts can directly utilize sunlight for photocatalytic conversion at high efficiencies, but suffers from lack of specificity.1-3 Recently, nano-biohybrid catalysts have been suggested an alternative, to combine the best properties of high turnover, efficiency, and selectivity, in a single biocatalyst both using in vitro4-7 and in vivo8-10 studies.

Moreover, living or whole-cell biohybrids offer additional advantage of self-replication or growth, avoiding enzyme deactivation, and enzyme regeneration and repair. Living nano-biohybrid organism, or nanorgs, combine these functionalities as a platform where targeted interfacial chemistry and specific enzyme attachment can be used to ensure facile uptake, self-assembly, and light-driven catalysis to specific chemicals or solar fuels.10

Further, these nanorgs do not require any energetic substrates like, for e.g., sugars, glucose, or NADH, and can directly trigger an energetically uphill biocatalytic transformation of inexpensive substrates (air, CO2) using wireless transfer of energy from light (or sunlight), for a range of selective biochemical or fuel generation as living microbial factories. To further advance nanorgs beyond semiconductor nanoparticles, here we demonstrate nanorgs made from small, sub-1 nanometer Au NCs.11-13 Besides the biocompatibility of Au and their large extinction coefficient,14-16 this work will also serve to advance expanding the nanorg platform to a wide range of materials and microbial platforms.

As described herein, nanorgs were engineered by screening different Au NCs17-20 for biocompatibility with exemplary bacterial strains described herein. For providing good biocompatibility, facile uptake, low hydrodynamic radius, and efficient removal/clearance of unattached Au NC, we focused on Au NCs capped with the zwitterionic ligand, glutathione (GSH).21-23 These atomically-precise Au NCs were synthesized using simple wet-chemistry, with tunable optoelectronic properties (FIG. 43a), hydrodynamic size (FIG. 43b), surface charge (FIG. 43c), and electrochemical properties (FIG. 43d) by modifying experimental factors, e.g. reaction pH, reducing agents, or reaction time. While these glutathione-capped Au NCs have similar sub-1 nm size, their optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, e.g. HOMO-LUMO state energies, bandgaps etc. were slightly different. To further understand how these differences in light absorption, charge injection could affect the production yield, we focused on visible or near-infrared light-activated Au NCs with 18, 22, and 25 Au atoms (labeled as Au18, Au22, and Au25). The nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Azotobacter vinelandii, were selected to couple to these Au NCs to form Au NC-A. vinelandii nano-biohybrids. Under visible light irradiation, photoexcited electrons (from Au NCs) with suitable redox potential can directly inject to the nitrogenase in A. vinelandii, followed by conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia in ambient air (FIG. 43e).

To allow direct electron transfer from light-activated Au NCs to the intracellular nitrogenase enzyme, cellular uptake and biocompatibility of these nanoclusters are required. Due to their extremely small sizes and favorable surface charge (zwitterionic), intracellular incorporation of these nanoclusters was as high as 90% (FIG. 44a). An additional merit of using the A. vinelandii DJ995 strain (produces a His-tagged nitrogenase) is the strong Au NCs-nitrogenase coupling facilitated by the Au-histidine interactions (to be discussed later). Due to their similar hydrodynamic size and surface charge, these nanoclusters demonstrated similar cellular uptake for A. vinelandii (FIG. 44a). However, significant differences in their biocompatibility were observed, under dark and light-activated conditions. By treating A. vinelandii with Au22 NCs in dark or with light irradiation, we observed almost no effect on growth inhibition (as shown in the growth curves, FIG. 44b, 44c), or loss of cell viability (after 5 hour light irradiation, as shown in the resazurin assay in FIG. 44d) even at very high NC concentration (up to 20 μM). Similarly, Au25 (FIG. 44b-d) and the smaller Au10-12, Au15 NCs (FIG. 47A-C) demonstrate high biocompatibility with minor loss in cell viability. While A. vinelandii show no biocompatibility issues with Au18 NCs when treated in dark, light-treatment renders up to 80% growth inhibition and 95% loss of cell viability. This difference indicates that Au18 NCs were not suitable for building living nanorgs.

To further probe the effect of cell viability and coupling chemistry between Au NCs and nanorg enzymes, we carried out light-driven ammonia production using these Au NCs-A. vinelandii nanorgs in sugar-free media. This reaction relies on the injection of light-induced electrons from Au NCs to the nitrogenase in the bacteria cells. Since nitrogenase is extremely sensitive to oxygen and is normally protected inside living cells, loss of cell viability could render the complete or partial loss of enzyme activity if rendered in air.4,10,24,25 In order to verify this and correlate the cell viability with product yield, we compared the photocatalytic ammonia turnover number carried out in air (contains dinitrogen and dioxygen) and pure dinitrogen (oxygen-free). Using respective ammonia yield performed in pure dinitrogen as a reference, no change of ammonia production was observed in air with nanorgs made from Au22 NCs, while the ammonia turnover number with Au18 NCs decreased to 30% of the yield in dinitrogen (FIG. 45A). The decrease of ammonia yield in air using nanorgs built from Au18 NCs corresponds to the loss of cell viability, whose nitrogenase is partially inactivated by oxygen in air. Similar control experiments were performed in an argon atmosphere, and no detection of ammonia indicates the dinitrogen as the sole nitrogen source instead of the reaction media or the bacteria cellular components for ammonia production. Other control tests, including the removal of light, removal of cells, and Au NCs, were conducted to prove the generation of ammonia from light-driven enzymatic conversion in these nanorgs. To probe the effect of coupling chemistry between Au NCs and enzymes on nanorg biocatalytic conversion, we compared the light-driven ammonia production performance using the optimal Au22 NCs with different A. vinelandii strains (FIG. 45b).

As mentioned previously, we selected the DJ995 strain that produces a nitrogenase with a 7× histidine tag in order to facilitate its coupling to the Au NCs (using Au-histidine interactions). As a comparison, a wild-type strain (A. vinelandii Wards) with no such affinity was also used to form the nanorgs. Under the same photocatalytic tests, their ammonia yield is half compared to our optimized systems, which could be explained by the poor electron transfer from the Au22 to the nitrogenase due to unfavorable coupling between them. This again highlights the importance of (specific) coupling between the Au NCs and the enzyme for effective fuel production, as reported previously in the CdS/ZnS QDs-His-tagged nitrogenase biohybrids.10 Similar tests were also conducted on nanorgs made from A. vinelandii DJ1003 strain, which produces an apo-nitrogenase (also with histidine-tag) that lacks the essential Mo—Fe cofactors for nitrogen fixation. As expected, negligible amount of ammonia was produced.

To optimize the turnover number, turnover frequency, and the photon-to-chemical conversion yield (quantum yield, QY), we conducted concentration-dependent light-driven air-water reduction reaction with different Au NCs-A. vinelandii nanorgs. Kinetics of ammonia production indicates no loss of nanorg viability or nitrogenase activity for more than 4 hours in Au22 NC nanorgs (FIG. 46a), as shown in an almost linear increase of ammonia turnover number with time. The initial increase of ammonia turnover number with increasing Au22 NCs concentration (FIG. 46b) can be explained by more efficient light capture and electron generation. However, as more Au22 NCs are added, an insignificant increase of ammonia turnover number beyond 8 μM Au22 NCs could be attributed to the intracellular nitrogenase bottleneck, where all available enzymes are coupled to the NCs. Similarly, nanorgs made from Au25 NCs show initial increase of ammonia yield with NC concentration due to improved electron supply from light-activated NCs, while significant decrease of yield with 20 μM NCs is most likely caused by viability loss issues, which is also the reason of overall low ammonia yield for nanorgs made from Au18 NCs. As for nanorgs made from Au10-12 and Au15 NCs, low ammonia yield (FIG. 48) could be explained by insufficient visible light absorption. Using the optimized conditions in nanorgs made from Au18, Au22, and Au25 NCs, the highest ammonia turnover frequency (FIG. 46c) of >2×107 h−1 can be realized. To further understand the photon-to-chemical conversion efficiency, internal QY was calculated (FIG. 46d), by considering the total photon absorbed by the nanorgs and the final electrons resulted in ammonia generation. To estimate the maximum theoretical conversion yield, we estimated the photon flux per nano-biohybrid enzyme (˜5×1015 photons/sec/cm2), the nanorg density using cell OD (approximately 108 nanorgs/cm2), and the number of biohybrid enzymes (approximately 10,000 biohybrid enzymes/nanorg), to obtain the photon flux per biohybrid enzymes (approximately 000 photons/biohybrid enzyme/sec). Comparing this to enzyme turnover (for MFN enzyme, 3000 nmol/mg/sec for 250 kDa enzyme≈750/sec), we estimated a maximum possible quantum efficiency to approximately 16-20% for photons-to-chemical generation using enzyme activation with light, limited by enzyme turnover rate.10 Therefore, this light-driven enzyme activity (zero in dark, and close to thermodynamic efficiency/enzyme turnover frequency on light irradiation) also provides a valuable tool to precisely control the enzyme activity of each enzyme individually using focused light (using either optics, or combined with multiphoton absorption in Au NCs/QDs), or controlling light intensity, thereby providing unprecedented control over single-enzyme sites for fine-tuning the enzyme activity, without changing the genetics/synthetic biology, or chemical changes to the cell. The highest QY of 14% (FIG. 46d) is very close to this theoretical maximum, indicating a highly efficient photon-to-fuel conversion system by combining efficacies of both high-efficiency light-sensitizer and high-selectivity enzymatic systems.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated light-driven biochemical catalysis using Au NC-A. vinelandii living nano-biohybrids (nanorgs), with a high turnover number (108 mol/mol of cells) and turnover frequency (>2×107 h−1) for ammonia production in ambient air. By screening different atomically-precise Au NCs capped with zwitterionic ligand glutathione, we have selected the best candidate, Au22 NCs, combining desired properties of high cellular uptake, effective light capture, suitable redox potential for electron transfer, and non-toxicity/biocompatibility, for building the nanorgs. In addition, the coupling of Au NCs to the His-tagged nitrogenase produced by A. vinelandii DJ995 strain demonstrates the importance of strong histidine-Au binding for high-efficiency biocatalytic applications. The optimized system can yield a high turnover frequency >2×107 h−1, with photon-to-chemical conversion efficiency (QY yield of 14%) approaching to the theoretical limit (16-20%). Since such high turnover number and frequency is difficult to achieve using conventional synthetic tools and such precise control over individual enzyme activity is not possible with most energetic substrates/conventional substrate-driven enzymatic catalysis, it could provide a new pathway for potentially better design of or high-throughput optimization of such biocatalytic reaction in optimized microbial systems.

These results can pave the way for expanding the choice of available benign and biocompatible materials, some with smaller sized light capturing/emitting particles than QDs, with high absorption cross-sections for use with optimized microbes, e.g. engineered, for building living nanorgs that can carry out light-driven biochemical catalysis for renewable solar fuel generation.

The use of such QDs and gold nanoclusters may also provide benefits over other systems for producing chemicals including reducing costs and lowering negative environmental impact of production.

## EXPERIMENTAL

### Synthesis of Glutathione-Capped Gold Nanoclusters (NCs)

Atomically-precise gold NCs capped with glutathione (GSH) capping ligands were synthesized based on the methods reported by Ghosh et al., Zhang et al., and Kamat et. al.11-20

Au18 NCs were synthesized by dissolving 150 mg HAuCl43H2O in 1.2 mL methanol and adding 1.8 mL DI Water. 300 mg of glutathione was added to this solution and sonicated to dissolve. Once the glutathione dissolved and the color changed from yellow to almost colorless. 96 mL methanol was then added and stirred for 10 min. 4.5 mL of a 220 mM NaBH3CN solution was added under vigorous stirring for 30 min. After 30 min the precipitate was removed by centrifugation and washed with methanol repeatedly to remove any remaining precursor. Finally, the precipitate was dissolved in water and freeze-dried to obtain a pale red powder identified as Au18SG14.

Au22 NCs were prepared by mixing 12.5 mL 20 mM HAuCl4 and 7.5 mL 50 mM glutathione solution in a 500 mL flask containing 180 mL of DI water. After vigorously stirring for 2 min, the pH was raised to 12.0 with 1M NaOH, after which 0.24 mg NaBH4 in 0.1 mL DI water was added to the reaction with sitting at 500 rpm. After 30 min, the pH was lowered to 2.5 with 0.33 M HCl. The reaction solution was then sealed airtight with stirring at 200 rpm and allowed to react for 8 hours forming a red-emitting Au22 solution. The NCs were cleaned by using isopropyl alcohol and centrifugation and finally resuspended in water and kept in the fridge away from light for future use.

Au10-12, Au15, and Au25 NCs were synthesized by carbon monoxide (CO) reducing techniques. Briefly, in a 125 ml flask with 20 ml distilled water, 100 mM HAuCl4 and 200 mM reduced glutathione were added to a final concentration of 1 mM and 2 mM, respectively. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7, 9, and 11 for Au10-12, Au15, and Au25 NCs synthesis, respectively. The flask was sealed with a rubber septum and flush with pure CO gas through a syringe needle for 2 min. The mixture was violently stirred for 24 hours and the resulting Au NCs was precipitated with an excess amount of isopropanol, followed by separating with centrifugation at 5,000 rpm. The precipitates were dried with clean air and re-suspend in distilled water. The Au NCs were stored in 4° C. for future tests.

### Characterization of Au NCs

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectra were measured using the UV1600PC UV-VIS spectrometer (VWR). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed on Litesizer 500 (Anton-Paar) to quantify the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of the Au NCs.

The conduction band (CB) of the NCs was characterized using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), with a Bio-logic SP200 potentiostat. A three-electrode configuration with a 3 mm glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used. Au NCs suspension (in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte) was bubbled with argon for 10 min before the measurement. DPV was taken with the following parameters: 50 ms pulse width, 50 mV pulse height, 200 ms step width, and 4 mV step height (˜20 mV/s scan rate).

### Preparation of A. vinelandii Culture

A. vinelandii DJ995 and DJ1003 strain were kindly provided by the Dennis group (Virginia Tech). Typically, bacteria were grown in nitrogen-limited Burk media (with 3 mM urea) at 30° C., with 200 rpm shaking. Cultures at an optical density (OD) ˜1.5 (overnight culture) were collected for future tests.

### Cell Growth Curve And Viability Tests

Cell growth curves and resazurin assays were performed in Burk media and photocatalytic media, respectively, with a variation of Au NC size. A. vinelandii DJ995 was first grown in nitrogen-free Burk media and harvested near OD 1.0, washed twice and resuspended in photocatalytic media. The cells and their respective NCs were then incubated and subject to light-exposure to produce NH3. After production was complete (˜4 hrs) the nanorg mixtures were subject to both growth and viability measurements. The cell growth curves were taken in a 96-well microplate at 30 C with vigorous shaking and monitored using a microplate reader (TECAN GENios) controlled by Megellan 7.2 software. An initial OD of 0.1 in Burk media was used for the growth curves. The resazurin assay was performed separately in a 96-well plate with the bacteria maintained at an OD of 1.0 after the photocatalytic tests. Resazurin was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and the fluorescence was measured at 620 nm (485 excitation) over the course of 2 hours.

### Example V

**Cellular Uptake**

Uptake of Au NCs by A. vinelandii was determined by a UV-vis spectrophotometric method. NCs first had their UV-vis spectra recorded in photocatalytic media at the desired concentration (20 μM). The initial absorption value at the first excitonic peak was taken to be the 0% uptake mark (Absi). Then the NCs at the desired concentration (20 μM) were incubated with the bacteria at OD 1.0 in photocatalytic media for 15 minutes on a shaker at 250 rpm. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm and aliquots of the supernatant were taken for UV-vis measurement. The absorption values of the supernatant at the corresponding excitonic peak position (Absf) were used to calculate the uptake % using the following equation:

Uptake %=Abs2Absf/Abs1×100%

**Light-Driven Ammonia Production and Ammonia Assay**

Ammonia production with the nanorgs was achieved by first growing A. vinelandii to an OD of ˜1.0 in Burk media. The cells were then washed twice with sugar-free photocatalytic media (25 mM ascorbic acid 35 mM HEPES) to remove any residual sugars. Cells were then resuspended in photocatalytic media and diluted to a final OD of 1.0. The Au NCs were then added to the bacteria and allowed to incubate for 15 min before subjecting to production. For production, the nanorgs were subjected to light irradiation (405 nm LED, 1.6 mW/cm2) for 5 hours on a shaker at 250 rpm. 25 μL aliquots were taken at various time points throughout the reaction to monitor the kinetics.

Ammonia was quantified using a fluorescent assay described previously. Typically, 25 μl sample was added to 0.5 ml o-phthalaldehyde assay reagent and incubated in dark for 30 min, followed by measuring the fluorescence at 472 nm (excitation at 410 nm).

**CdS and CdSe QDs: Nanoparticle (NP) Synthesis**

CdS and CdSe nanoparticles for QDs were synthesized using a modified method developed by Peng et. al, (12/20). Their size can be controlled by varying the amount of oleic acid (OA) capping ligand. A total 12 g mixture containing 38.4 mg CdO, 316, 1904, or 5712 μl OA and 1-octadecene (ODE) was vacuum-degassed at 80° C. and refilled with argon for three cycles. The mixture was then heated up to 300° C. and injected with a sulfur precursor (4.8 mg sulfur powder dispersed in ODE). The resulting reaction phase was cooled down to 250° C. and the CdS QDs were grown for 1 hour. The removal of unconsumed cadmium and oleic acid was performed by extraction with warm CH3OH (50° C.) in a separation funnel. This process was repeated three times and the resulting ODE layer was obtained, the removal of residual CH3OH was carried out under vacuum at 80° C. To transfer the CdS nanoparticles to chloroform (CHCI3), the ODE layer was precipitated with chloroform and acetone followed by washing for at least three times. The CdS nanoparticles for QDs were re-dispersed in chloroform and stored in the dark. CdSe nanoparticles for QDs with varying sizes were synthesized using the same method, with the sulfur being replaced with a selenium precursor (12 mg selenium powder dispersed in ODE with 41 μl tributylphosphine (TBP)). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectra (FIG. 12A-F) were measured using the UVT600PC UV-VIS spectrometer (VWR).

**InP@ZnS Core-Shell QDs (IPZS) Synthesis**

IPZS were synthesized using a modified method developed by Fichter et. al, (26). A mixture of 9 ml oleylamine (OLA), 119.4 mg InCl3, and 73.5 mg ZnCb were subjected to a vacuum, using a Schlenk system, at 110° C. for 1 h, followed by recharging with argon and ramping the temperature to 220° C. After 15 min, 0.24 ml tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine ((TMS)3P) was swiftly injected into the mixture, and the InP cores were allowed to continue growing for 10 min. The reaction phase was then cooled down to 80° C., and 1.27 ml of 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) was added drop-wise. The system was vacuum-degassed and recharged with argon, followed by raising the temperature to 200° C. for 1 hour. After cooling down to 70° C., 5 ml hexane was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the large aggregates. The supernatant was precipitated with excess acetone, and the particles were obtained by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 20 min. After drying with N2, the precipitate was suspended in 10 min OLA with 142.2 mg zinc stearate. The mixture was degassed and recharged with argon, and the temperature was raised to 180° C. After 3 hours, the system was cooled down, and the IPZS were obtained by centrifugation as mentioned above, and as described herein, and re-suspended in hexane.

**Cu2ZnSnS4@ZnS QDs (CZTS) Synthesis**

CZTS QDs were synthesized following the procedure outlined by Yang et. al,S2 (27). Briefly, 0.13 g copper acetylacetonate, 0.05 g of zinc acetate dihydrate, 0.048 g of tin chloride, and 0.033 g of sulfur were added to 10 mL of oleylamine in a 40 mL round-bottom flask. The mixture was stirred under vacuum for 2 hours, then heated to 110° C. while purging with Ar and held for 30 min. The temperature was then raised to 280° C. and held for 1 hour, then cooled to room temperature. Precipitation of the nanoparticles was achieved by adding ethanol and centrifuging at 5,000 rpm for 20 min. Redispersion in chloroform and centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min was used to isolate and discard aggregates in the resulting pellet. ZnS shell growth follows the same protocols for the CdS or CdSe (see section D below, ZnS Shell Growth on CdS nanoparticle cores).

**ZnS Shell Growth on Nanoparticle Cores**

The synthesis (e.g., growing) of the CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles for QDs (CZS) was adapted from the method reported by Peng et. al, (4428). The size and concentration of the CdS cores (i.e. nanoparticles) were determined using the following formula:

D=(−6.6521×10−8)λ3+(1.9557×10−4)λ2−(9.2352×10−2)λ+13.29

ε5500×E×D2.5

c=A/εl

where λ, E, A are the wavelength, photon energy, and extinction at the first exciton peak, respectively. l is the optical path of the cuvette. D, ε, and c are the diameter, extinction coefficient and concentration of the CdS nanoparticles for QDs. The CdS stock solution (dispersed in ODE) was determined to have a concentration of 0.0377 mM.

The zinc precursor (0.1 M Zn2+) was prepared by a heating a degassed mixture containing 82 mg ZnO, 2.82 ml (2.51 g) OA and 7.2 ml ODE to 250° C. The resulting clear solution was cooled down and stored in a septum sealed vial. The precursor was gently heated up to 60° C. before use.

The sulfur precursor (0.1 M) was prepared by dispersing 32 mg sulfur powder in 10 ml ODE with sonication. The resulting clear solution was bubbled with argon for 30 min and stored in a septum sealed vial.

ZnS shells were grown using a layer-by-layer deposition. A mixture containing 120 nmol CdS cores (3.55 nm; 3.2 ml CdS stock solution) and 2 ml oleylamine (OLA) was vacuum degassed and recharged with argon for three cycles under 120° C. A defined amount of zinc and sulfur precursors were injected simultaneously, and the reaction phase was kept at 120° C. for 5 min. The reaction was then raised up to 220° C. for the growth (20 min) of the first ZnS layer. The reaction was then cooled down to 120° C., and the UV-VIS spectrum was taken to determine the extinction coefficient of the CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles (CZS). The resulting solution could be either washed (similar to CdS nanoparticles for QDs) or used for 2nd or 3rd ZnS layer growth. To grow nominal 1 approximately 3 monolayer ZnS shells, 0.44, 0.60 and 0.77 ml of zinc and sulfur precursors (each) in solvent were used, respectively, (determined by simple geometrical calculation, as reported by Peng et al.) zinc and sulfur precursors (each) were used, respectively.

The real thickness of CdS shell and extinction coefficient of CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles (summarized in Table S1, Table S1-2) were determined by UV-VIS spectrum (FIG. 12C) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively.

The real thickness of the ZnS coating can be estimated from the cadmium and zinc ratio (determined by ICP-MS) by using simple geometrical calculations shown in FIG. 7, Scheme 6.1, and described herein.

Similar to the CZS, CdSe@ZnS core-shell QDs (CZSe) can be synthesized using the same layer-by-layer deposition technique. Starting with CdSe QDs with the first exciton peak position at 500, 525 and 580 nm, CZSe1, CZSe2, and CZSe3 with green, yellow, and orange emission (FIG. 12A-F) can be synthesized with a nominal two monolayer ZnS shell.

**Ligand Exchange**

QDs (nanoparticles) suspended in CHCl3 were phase transferred into aqueous solution by ligand exchange with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), L-cysteine (CYS) or cysteamine (CA). For ligand exchange with MPA, 0.1 ml MPA was added to 0.3 ml QD suspension (approximately 10 mM). 0.3 ml ethanol (EtOH) was added, and the mixture was vigorously stirred with gentle heating. 1 ml 1 M NaOH solution was then added, and stirred for a further 5 min. The upper part (aqueous phase) was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm. The obtained QD precipitates were re-suspended in water pH 11. The QD suspension was further concentrated with a 3,000 Da centrifugal filter and washed twice with water pH 11. The concentration of the QD suspension (in water) was determined using the UV-VIS spectra. Ligand exchange with CYS is similar. For the ligand exchange with CA, cysteamine hydrochloride was used, with the replacement of 1 M NaOH solution by DI water and finally re-suspended in water pH 4. The ligand-exchanged QDs (nanoparticle suspension) were stable for up to 1 week in the 4° C. fridge.

**Characterization of the QDs**

A. Optical Spectroscopy.

Ultraviolet-visible spectra of the QDs were measured using the UV1600PC UV-VIS spectrometer (VWR), and the Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were taken using a QM-6 steady-state fluorimeter (PTI). The QDs optical spectra are shown in FIG. 12A-F.

B. Elemental Analysis

Real thickness of CdS shell and extinction coefficient of CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles.

The real thickness of CdS shell and extinction coefficient of CdS@ZnS core-shell nanoparticles (summarized in Table S1, Table S1-2) were determined by UV-VIS spectrum (FIG. 12C) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively.

The real thickness of the ZnS coating can be estimated from the cadmium and zinc ratio (determined by ICP-MS) by using simple geometrical calculations shown in FIG. 7 Scheme 6.1. Elemental analysis with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the real thickness (Table S1) of the ZnS shell from the cadmium and zinc ratio, based on a simple geometrical calculation (FIG. 7 shows Scheme S1).

Taking the 1 ML sample as an example: The volume and moles of the CdS core (diameter D1=3.55 nm, the density of CdS p(CdS)=4.82 g/cm3, MW is an approximate MW=molecular weight):

V(CdS)=π/6×D13=2.34×10−20 cm3

n(CdS)=p(CdS)×V(CdS)/MW(CdS)=7.83×10−22 mol

The total amount of Cd and Zn (in ppb) was determined by ICP-MS. Due to Zn impurity in Cd precursor used in the synthesis, the value for the shell Zn was corrected by the amount of Zn in the CdS core (assume in a single nanoparticle, the amount of Cd is the same):

\({{shell}\mspace{14mu}{Zn}\mspace{11mu}\left( {1\mspace{11mu}{ML}} \right)} = {{{total}\mspace{14mu}{Zn}\mspace{14mu}\left( {1\mspace{14mu}{ML}} \right)} = {{{- \frac{{total}\mspace{14mu}{Cd}\mspace{14mu}\left( {1\mspace{14mu}{ML}} \right)}{{total}\mspace{14mu}{Cd}\mspace{14mu}\left( {0\mspace{14mu}{ML}} \right)}} \times {total}\mspace{14mu}{Zn}\mspace{14mu}\left( {0\mspace{14mu}{ML}} \right)} = {25390\mspace{14mu}{ppb}}}}\)

The molar ratio of Zn to Cd (AW=approximate atomic weight):

\({r\left( {{Zn}:{Cd}} \right)} = {\frac{{shell}\mspace{14mu}{Zn}\mspace{14mu}{\left( {1\mspace{20mu}{ML}} \right)/{AW}}\mspace{14mu}({Zn})}{{total}\mspace{14mu}{Cd}\mspace{14mu}{\left( {1\mspace{14mu}{ML}} \right)/{AW}}\mspace{14mu}({Cd})} = 0.462}\)

The moles and volume of the ZnS shell (the density of ZnS p(ZnS)=4.10 g/cm3):

n(ZnS)=r(Zn:Cd)×n(CdS)=3.62×10−22 mol

V(ZnS)=n(ZnS)×MW(ZnS)/p(ZnS)=0.860×10−20 cm3

The total volume and diameter of the CdS @ZnS QDs:

V(CdS@ZnS)=V(CdS)+V(ZnS)=3.20×10−20 cm3

D(CdS@ZnS)=(6×V(CdS@ZnS)/π)1/3=3.94 nm

The real thickness (in ML unit, ZnS monolayer thickness d(ZnS)=0.312 nm):

Thickness (ZnS)=(D(CdS@ZnS)−D(CdS))/(2×d(ZnS))=0.63ML

The extinction coefficient (at a specific wavelength) of the QDs (core-shell, with nominal 2 monolayer ZnS shell) can be determined using the amount of QDs cores and the UV-VIS of the core-shell QDs. These values are summarized in Table S2.

C. Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) Electrochemical Analysis

Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with QDs (in) suspension was used to determine the conduction and valence band positions of the CdX (X=S, Se) QDs. Refs. 27, 29, 45. This was done using a three-electrode configuration with a 2 mm platinum plate electrode, platinum wire, and silver wire as the working, counter, and (quasi-) reference electrode. Ferrocene was used as an internal reference. The CdX QDs (nanoparticles) were suspended in CH2Cl2 with 100 mM n-Bu4NPF6 as the electrolyte. The whole system was purged with argon, and the DPV was measured using a Bio-logic SP200 potentiostat with the following parameters: 50 ms pulse width, 50 mV pulse height, 200 ms step width and 4 mV step height (which corresponds to a 20 mV/s scan rate). The results are presented in FIG. 13A-D and the conduction/valence band (CB/VB) positions are listed The results are presented in FIG. 13A-D and the conduction/valence band (CB/VB) positions are listed in Table S3. The conduction/valence band (CB/VB) can be determined from the backward (cathodic) and forward (anodic) scan, respectively (FIG. 13A-D, Table S3). The same measurements were conducted on the other QDs.

D. CdS, CdSe, CdS(S>ZnS Nanoparticle Thin Film Electrochemistry.

QD thin film electrochemistry was conducted to evaluate the charge carrier dynamics of the QDs. The CdS, CdSe and CdS@ZnS nanoparticles (in ODE) were transferred into CHCI3, as described herein. 50 ul of about 5 uM suspension of nanoparticles were drop-casted on clean fluorinated-tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (about 0.5 cm2) and fully dried in a vacuum desiccator. The CdS, CdSe, and CdS@ZnS QD electrodes were fabricated by drop-casting 50 μl of 5 μM QDs suspension (in chloroform) on the clean fluorinated-tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides (approximately 0.5 cm2).

Electrochemical measurements were taken using a three-electrode configuration, with the QD electrodes/nanoparticle coated FTO glass, platinum wire and Ag/AgCl electrode as a working, counter, and reference electrodes. 0.5 M sodium sulfate (pH=6.4) solution was used as an electrolyte. The whole system was purged with argon for 20 min before the measurements were taken.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the charge trapping and charge transfer in these QDs under light irradiation. Measurements were taken under 365 nm UV irradiation (˜5 mW/cm2) at open circuit potential (OCP), with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 MHz. These spectra are shown with the Nyquist plot (FIG. 13E-G). Total capacitance (Ctotai) and space charge layer resistance (Rsc) can be extracted by fitting the spectra to the equivalent circuit described in FIG. 13H.

Open circuit potential (OCP) was used to evaluate the charge transfer and charge recombination on the QD surface. The OCP of the QD electrode was first measured in the dark, followed by irradiation with 365 nm UV light (˜5 mW/cm2) until the OCP reached constant values (FIG. 13i). The decay of OCP (with the “turn-off of the irradiation) was used to obtain the carrier lifetime (Table S4) regarding the surface charge recombination and charge injection to water, using a bi-exponential fit (Reference Nos. 29, 30, S4, S5): OCP (V)=A1e−t/t1+A2e−t/t2 where t1 and t2 refer to the radiative/non-radiative charge recombination lifetime (faster) and the charge transfer lifetime (slower), respectively. And the coefficient (A1 and A2) indicates the relative fraction of these two carrier decay pathways. A significant loss of charge carriers (through surface recombination) were observed in the 0 ML and 1 ML samples due to the large A1/A2 ratio. For the 2 ML sample, there is still a significant number of charge carriers which end up transferring their charge to water.

E. Zeta Potential Measurements.

The zeta potential of the CYS-capped CZS (suspended in water with different pH values) was quantified using a Litesizer 500 (Anton-Paar). As expected (FIG. 14), CYS-capped QDs showed a decrease of zeta potential with increasing pH values, with the surface charge changing from positive to negative. The change in surface charge demonstrates the zwitterionic characteristic of cysteine, which could facilitate the incorporation of CYS-capped QDs by the cells.
