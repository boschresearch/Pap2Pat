    "abstract": "A method is provided for manufacturing an article comprising a transparent conductive material, wherein a transparent conductive material (e.g., indium tin oxide) is deposited onto a substrate (e.g., fused silica) by physical vapor deposition, then annealed at high temperature (i.e., at least 450\u00b0 C.) in a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting article comprises a transparent conductive material that reduces the trade-off between low resistivity (or sheet resistance) and high near infrared transmission. For example, the transparent conductive material thus obtained may possess a transmission of at least 80% at 1550 nm while having a resistivity of less than or equal to about 5\u00d710\u22124 Ohm-cm and a Haacke figure of merit of at least about 40\u00d710\u22124\u03a9\u22121. Also provided is a method for modulating the resistivity and/or the near infrared transmission of a transparent conductive material by annealing the transparent conductive material at a high temperature under nitrogen atmosphere.",

                        "Transparent conductors (TCs) are capable of conducting electricity while being optically transparent, and thus are essential elements in many optoelectronic and photonic devices such as solar cells, touch screens, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs). In many applications, high optical transmission beyond the visible spectrum into the infrared (IR) wavelengths is crucial. Examples include high-efficiency solar cells (which convert IR and visible light into electricity), IR photodetectors and imaging cameras, IR light sources, and optical communications operating in the low loss window of optical fibers. Materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, ultra-thin metal films, metallic nanowires, conductive polymers, and wide band gap semiconductors have been widely studied as transparent conductors, but they typically have been investigated and optimized in the visible wavelength range (380-750 nm).",
                        "Despite the development of many alternative transparent conductors, indium tin oxide (ITO) is still considered a prototypical material due to its high transmission, electrical conductivity, excellent adhesion, etching properties, and stability in harsh environments. Considerable effort has been directed toward increasing the transparency and conductivity of ITO films with various doping mechanisms, thermal/chemical treatments and deposition methods. However, most of the work so far has focused on transparency in the visible spectrum. ITO transparent conductors for the near IR wavelength range (750-2400 nm) exhibit poor transmission performance, when compared to the visible range. And when high transmission has been achieved, it has been at the expense of the electrical conductivity.",
                        "Therefore, there exists a need for transparent conductor materials having high transmission in the near IR range and having low resistivity (i.e., high conductivity), and for methods of forming the same."

During annealing, the N2 flow was reduced to 2 L min\u22121. Upon completion of the annealing time, the N2 flow was increased to 10 L min\u22121 to expedite cooling of the process chamber.

The depth profiles in FIGS. 4B and 5B show that the HTA annealing produces a nanostructured surface with large grooves with depths up to approximately 10-15 nm or greater (FIG. 5B), while the as-deposited ITO shows no such features (FIG. 4B).",

These surface morphological evolutions may make ITO films advantageous for use in applications such as organic solar cells, where an increase in contact area between the hole transport layer and the ITO anode may eventually increase the hole extraction efficiency and thus permit higher power conversion efficiency."

                                "To investigate the effect of annealing conditions on the optical properties of LTA and HTA-ITO films, 100-nm ITO films were deposited onto fused silica substrates by magnetron sputtering (Example 1). The films were then characterized by spectrophotometry to determine transmission, reflection, and absorption as a function of annealing time (Examples 1c-1j, from 15 min to 10 hr) at 750\u00b0 C., as shown in FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C, respectively.",
                                "FIGS. 7A-C compare the optical spectra of HTA-ITO substrates compared with as-deposited (bare) ITO and LTA-ITO. Based on FIG. 7A, it is clear that the transmission in the near infrared region (750-2400 nm) increases with HTA annealing time. The observed increase in transmission is a function of reduction in reflection (FIG. 7B) and absorption (FIG. 7C) with increased HTA annealing time. Table 2 summarizes the optical characterization data along with sheet resistance data (Example 4).",
                                "As shown in Table 2, with HTA annealing of 10 hr (Example 1j), a maximum transmission of 82.35% is achieved at the wavelength 1550 nm, with corresponding sheet resistance of 22.3 Ohm/sq. Corresponding average transmissions of 77.81% and 83.85% are achieved in the near-TR (750-2400 nm) and visible (380-750 nm) spectra, respectively. In contrast, after only 15 minutes of HTA annealing (Example 1c), the films exhibited a lower sheet resistance of 12.24 Ohm/sq., a higher average visible transmission of 86.04%, and a lower NIR transmission of 63.71%. Thus, the data in Table 2 demonstrate that the sheet resistance and optical properties can be modulated by altering the HTA duration.",
                                "Furthermore, Table 2 compares the data for HTA-ITO with that obtained for LTA-ITO. As compared to the HTA-ITO data, the LTA process affords a higher sheet resistance of 15.74 Ohm/sq., with lower transmission of 86.89% and 56.3% in the visible and near-IR regions, respectively. This comparison underlines the substantial improvement in resistivity and transmission trade-offs that can be achieved with HTA annealing."

FIG. 8A plots the transmission data against resistivity. All the NIR transmission values include substrate contribution. However, transmission depends on ITO thickness (because of the thickness-related loss of absorption), so thinner ITO samples tend to exhibit higher transmission. Therefore, for another mode of comparison, FIG. 8B plots corresponding NIR transmission data (1550 nm) versus calculated sheet resistance (sheet resistance=resistivity divided by thickness).",
                                "Regardless of whether resistivity or sheet resistance is used as the basis for comparison HTA-ITO prepared according the present disclosure offers an improvement in transmission and resistivity (or sheet resistance) trade-offs. In other words, HTA-ITO according to the present disclosure offers a lower resistivity for a given transmission value, or a higher transmission for a given resistivity, as compared to the Comparative Examples. Even when sheet resistance is considered, although the HTA-ITO of the present disclosure appears to provide similar or only slightly better trade-offs than, e.g., Comparative Examples 6 and 7, the HTA-ITO of the present disclosure is much thinner. For example the presently disclosed HTA-ITO is 2.5 and 5 times thinner than for Comparative Examples 6 and 7, respectively. Additionally, the ITO materials of the present disclosure show an improved Haacke FoM over the Comparative Examples. For instance, Example 1j shows a transmission at 1550 nm of 82.4% and a Haacke FoM of 64.289\u00d710\u22124\u03a9\u22121, compared to Comparative Example 6, which shows a transmission of approximately 80% but a Haacke FoM of only 41.027\u00d710\u22124\u03a9\u22121.",
                                "The thin films of ITO deposited according to the present disclosure are advantageous for several reasons. While not being bound to any particular theory, it is hypothesized that using thin films on the order of 15 nm to 500 nm enables high optical transmission. Optical loss occurs primarily due to reflection at the glass-ITO interfaces and absorption by the ITO itself. By using ITO films on the order of between 15 nm to 500 nm thick (e.g., 100 nm thick), reflection does not change significantly, while absorption decreases. Thus, the transmission increases. Additionally, indium is a scarce and expensive material, so using thinner films decreases the material quantity and cost.",
                                "The trade-off between optical transparency in the NIR region (as shown by transmission spectra) and resistivity, as a function of annealing conditions, is shown in FIG. 9A. The chart shows data for as-deposited ITO (Example 1a), LTA-ITO annealed at 200\u00b0 C. for 1 hr, in air (Example 1b), and HTA-ITO annealed at 750\u00b0 C. for 15 min to 10 hr, under N2 (Examples 1c-1j). In particular, the data for HTA-ITO shows the transmission in the NIR range and at 1550 nm increase markedly as annealing time at 750\u00b0 C. increases, while the average transmission in the visible range slightly decreases but stays above 80%, regardless of increases in resistivity. The data shows that as the transmission increases, the resistivity also increases but remains much lower than for as-deposited ITO. FIG. 9A also shows that the NIR transmission is much higher for HTA-ITO than for LTA-ITO, for the same resistivity.",
                                "Without being bound to any particular theory, the increase in transmission in the NIR region and the corresponding increase in resistivity is believed to be a function of carrier density. The relationships among carrier density, mobility, resistivity, and annealing conditions are summarized in FIG. 9B, which plots carrier density (\u25aa) and carrier mobility (\u25cf) against resistivity for as-deposited ITO (Example 1a), LTA-ITO annealed at 200\u00b0 C. for 1 hr, in air (Example 1b), and HTA-ITO annealed at 750\u00b0 C. under N2 atmosphere for 15 min (Example 1c), 1 hr (Example 1e), 4 hr (Example 1g), and 10 hr (Example 1j). The data show that with increased annealing time, carrier density decreases. (This corresponds to the increase in NIR transmission, as shown in FIG. 9A). The reduction in carrier density may be due to reduction of defects (i.e., doping) with increased annealing time for HTA-ITO. Meanwhile, in comparison to as-deposited ITO and LTA-ITO, the HTA-ITO maintains higher mobility due to the improvement of crystallinity with higher-temperature annealing."
