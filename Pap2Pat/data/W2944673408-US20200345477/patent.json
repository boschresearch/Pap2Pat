    "abstract": "This invention provides a method for determining breast implant geometric properties, engineering stresses, engineering strains and engineering moduli; directly and quickly, using a load frame apparatus. More generally the invention provides a method for determining geometric properties and engineering mechanical properties of any elastomeric device, using a load frame apparatus. Engineering stress and engineering strain properties of breast implants are critical to their safety and durability. The geometric properties of breast implants undergoing compression also relates to the shape stability of breast implants, which may also be related to clinical outcomes such as capsular contracture and other untoward outcomes involving a breast capsule, such as Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL), double capsule formation, seroma formation and associated breast implant illness (BII).",

                                "Breast implants are regulated medical devices. Regulatory bodies such as the FDA require testing of these medical devices to prove that they are safe and durable.",
                                "Saline-filled and silicone gel-filled breast implants that are marketed today have undergone extensive mechanical testing to demonstrate strength and durability. Breast implant manufacturers have followed the recommendations provided by medical device regulatory bodies which require specific types of mechanical tests and expected strength and durability requirements of silicone shells and the finished product. Many of the current mechanical evaluations utilize ASTM and ISO standards. Mechanical testing that replicates clinical conditions is the goal of these experimental procedures, but this is difficult to achieve in the laboratory. Instead, breast implant manufacturers have used conventional experimental techniques that can be performed in any well-equipped mechanical testing laboratory.",
                                "Current routine breast implant testing includes tensile strength, ultimate elongation, tear resistance, joint testing, cyclic fatigue testing, ultimate strength tests, and valve competency (for saline-filled breast implants). These mechanical tests have not exactly simulated the in vivo environment. A test methodology that simulates in vivo conditions would be the desired procedure to evaluate the geometric and engineering mechanical properties of breast implants, but this is difficult to achieve in the laboratory.",
                                "Compression testing between two parallel plates, or platens, in air or saline solution, has been used previously by breast implant manufacturers for cyclic fatigue and ultimate strength testing. Flat plate compression testing has been used to provide breast implant cyclic fatigue failure characteristics, data for fatigue lifetime predictions, ultimate strength, and morphological features of fatigue failure.",
                                "To evaluate the stress and strain properties of breast implants when subjected to a compressive load, current methods entail complex and time-intensive finite element or finite difference modeling, and are not readily applied to assess the safety and durability of breast implants.",
                                "Hence, it is highly desirable to have a simplified method for evaluating the geometric and engineering mechanical properties of breast implants. This simplified method is needed not only to assess the safety and durability of current breast implants, but also to facilitate the design of safer and more durable future breast implants.",
                                "The geometric and engineering mechanical properties of breast implants subjected to compressive forces may also relate clinical outcomes such as capsular contracture, and other untoward outcomes involving a breast capsule, such as Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL), double capsule formation, seroma formation and associated breast implant illness (BII), and in vivo rupture. Consequently, a simplified and easily implemented means to assess these breast implant properties could aid in understanding their relationship to current clinical outcomes, and in designing breast implants which will have better clinical outcomes."

                        "This invention relates to quickly determining the geometry and engineering mechanical properties (e.g., engineering stresses, engineering strains and engineering moduli) of breast implants, in their implanted or implantable form, using only the load-displacement data that is typically generated from a load frame apparatus during mechanical testing procedures. When referring to a breast implant in this invention disclosure, it is understood that the breast implant is in its implanted or implantable form. A breast implant will comprise at least one shell-enclosed lumen, and breast implants comprised of more than one shell-enclosed lumen may also be referred to as a multi-lumen breast implant.",
                        "It was discovered that a geometry state of quasi-equilibrium could be assumed when breast implants are dynamically tested in a load frame apparatus, thereby eliminating the need for time-intensive manual measurements and data recording during load frame testing after each stepwise load change is applied to a breast implant. A quasi-equilibrium process is one in which the deviation from equilibrium is infinitesimal, and all the states the breast implant passes through during the transient, or dynamic, process may be considered equilibrium states. Therefore, this assumption constrains all breast implant properties to be constants for every instantaneous compression load during the automatic, or dynamic, load-displacement test process or dynamic load program.",
                        "This invention simplifies the determination of crucial breast implant properties that relate directly to the safety and durability of breast implants or other elastomeric devices. The invention also provides a quick test, taking only minutes, to ascertain a broad spectrum of geometric and engineering mechanical properties of a breast implant.",
                        "Using this invention, load (or force) measurements are acquired as a function of platen displacement, or plate spacing, in a load frame apparatus. These measured load-displacement parameters can be acquired automatically with a data acquisition system or recorded manually. With this load-displacement data, all geometric properties and engineering mechanical properties of the breast implant can be calculated knowing the breast implant volume and shell thickness if the breast implant is comprised of a shell enclosing a fluid such a saline solution or elastomeric filler such as a silicone gel.",
                        "The examples and description in this disclosure primarily reference a breast implant, however, it is understood that this invention can also be applied to other elastomeric devices for which the geometry of the elastomeric device can be accurately modeled in terms of geometric shapes or composites thereof that can be derived mathematically using plate spacing data from a load frame apparatus and the device's volume. An elastomeric device is understood to be any device comprised of an elastomeric material that encloses a lumen filled with a fluid or gel. In the context of this invention and engineering terminology, the term fluid is understood to be any gaseous or liquid material. An elastomeric device may also be monolithic or contiguous, with no enclosed fluids or gels.",
                        "This invention has been shown to produce accurate modeling of breast implant geometry, and therefore accurate engineering mechanical properties (i.e., stresses, strains and moduli) that are a function of the measured load and breast implant geometry.",
                        "This invention provides the means to quickly determine breast implant geometry using only the plate spacing data and breast implant volume, utilizing the novel approach of modeling a compressed breast implant as a combination of a flattened cylinder and the outer-half of a torus. The area of contact of the load frame platens with the breast implant can also be determined by this invention.",
                        "Given the geometric properties of a breast implant undergoing compression, various engineering mechanical properties can then be determined from the measured load profile. In particular, the internal pressure of the breast implant can be calculated from the load and platen contact area, the circumferential stress can be calculated from the load, shell thickness and breast implant geometry, and multi-dimensional strains can be calculated using the breast implant geometry.",
                        "Engineering stresses that can be determined by this invention include, but are not limited to, planform, circumferential and normal.",
                        "Engineering strains that can be determined using this invention include, but are not limited to, projection, diametric and areal, which refer to changes in breast implant height, diameter and surface area, respectively. Collectively, these engineering strains may be referred to as multi-dimensional strains. The breast implant multi-dimensional strains and associated breast implant shape change due to compression is a mechanical property that has not been previously evaluated for breast implants. Breast implant strain is directly related to breast implant shape change.",
                        "Engineering moduli, or the ratio of stress to strain, can also be calculated by this invention for a breast implant from only the load and displacement data and knowing the breast implant volume and shell thickness. Engineering moduli are important properties of breast implants which describe the compressibility, firmness and shape stability of a breast implant, which are crucial properties related to the safety and durability of breast implants."

                        "This invention relates to quickly determining the geometry and engineering mechanical properties of breast implants undergoing dynamic compression using only load-displacement data that are typically measured and recorded by a load frame apparatus. Breast implants are typically comprised of one or more lumens enclosed by a shell, with the one or more lumens filled with a fluid or gel. This invention simplifies the determination of crucial breast implant geometric properties and engineering mechanical properties that relate directly to the safety and durability of breast implants.",
                        "A load frame apparatus typically comprises an upper plate and a lower plate that have surfaces that are parallel to one another, whereby at least one of the platens, or plates, is controllably movable relative to the other thereby controlling the plate spacing and compression on a device disposed between the upper plate and lower plate. The separation distance between the two platens, or plates, is referred to as the plate spacing, or displacement, (H). The plate spacing can be programmably controlled to continuously (i.e., dynamically) or discretely (i.e., stepwise) decrease or increase with a crosshead speed, thus increasing or decreasing the compressive load on the object placed between the upper and lower platens. Discretely controlled plate spacing allows for static or manual measurements of breast implant geometric properties and plate spacing as it is subjected to a stepwise-applied load, whereas continuously or dynamically controlled plate spacing provides for dynamic measurements and automatic recording of breast implant geometric properties as it is subjected to a dynamic compressive load.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, this invention provides a method for utilizing dynamic measurements and appropriate geometry models of the compressed breast implant to quickly determine geometric properties and engineering mechanical properties of a breast implant without the need for complex and time-intensive calculations such as finite element or finite difference modeling, or time-intensive manual (or static) measurements.",
                        "The dynamic load program may comprise an increasing compressive load (decreasing plate spacing), an oscillatory compressive load having a frequency, a decreasing compressive load (increasing plate spacing), or any combinational sequence thereof. A load cell integrated into the load frame apparatus provides accurate measurement of force F, or load, exerted on an object disposed between the upper and lower platens, or plates. State-of-the-art load frames will allow plate spacing and load measurements to be recorded digitally as a function of time according to a prescribed data acquisition sampling rate.",
                        "FIG. 1 summarizes the process or protocol steps comprising the test method of this invention whereby a load frame apparatus is used to compute the engineering mechanical properties (i.e., engineering stresses, engineering strains and engineering moduli) of a breast implant. The terminology such as crosshead speed, load frame, load, displacement, platen spacing, and platens (or plates) used to describe the invention's method of FIG. 1 and throughout this invention disclosure is terminology known by, and used by, those skilled in the art of mechanical testing. The load frame is first calibrated 11. A breast implant is manufactured 21 and is loaded into the load frame apparatus and disposed between the two plates 13 of a calibrated load frame. Preferably, and prior to loading the breast implant between the platens, the breast implant volume V, shell thickness t, and initial implant geometry (e.g., Do, Ao, and Ho), should be recorded 23. However, the volume V and shell thickness t may also be recorded after completion of load program 17 when the breast implant has been removed from the load frame apparatus after completion of the test. The plate spacing H is then adjusted to a starting point 15, or initial state, for the testing so that both plates form an area of contact with the breast implant with minimal or near-zero load imparted on the breast implant. The plate spacing and near-zero initial compressive load is recorded 25. This type of initial state adjustment is commonly practiced by those skilled in the art of mechanical testing. The interface, or area of contact, between the platens and the breast implant, may be first optionally lubricated with a layer of lubricant as indicated by 12. To lubricate the interface, lubricant may be applied to the breast implant, load frame apparatus platens, or both. The lubricant must be compatible with the material of the breast implant to avoid alteration of the material properties of the breast implant during the test. Although the lubrication step of 12 is optional, it is a preferred embodiment of this invention to test breast implants both with lubrication and without lubrication. Examples of lubricants include, but are not limited to, aqueous solutions and silicone oils. A dynamic load program is then implemented 17 on the breast implant, whereby a compressive load is applied dynamically to the breast implant by dynamically changing the displacement (or plate spacing) between the upper plate and lower plate. The rate of change in displacement (or plate spacing) between the upper plate and lower plate in the field of mechanical testing is characterized as having a crosshead speed. In most load frame apparatus, this is equivalent to the rate or speed at which the upper plate moves relative to a stationary lower plate. The dynamically changing plate spacing (or displacement) and load are then recorded 27 during implementation of the dynamic load program 17. The dynamic plate spacing and dynamic compressive load are preferably automatically recorded using a data acquisition system integrated with the load frame apparatus. The implemented load program 17 may comprise an increasing compressive load (decreasing plate spacing), an oscillatory compressive load, a decreasing compressive load, or any combinational sequence thereof. The plate spacing H and load F are preferably recorded automatically by a data acquisition and storage system at a sampling rate, and then used along with the known constant breast implant's volume V and shell thickness t to compute the breast implant's geometry (e.g., contact diameter d of breast implant with the upper and lower plates, breast implant diameter D, and breast implant surface area A) and engineering mechanical properties (i.e., engineering stresses, engineering strains and engineering moduli) of the breast implant 30. Software may also be integrated into the data acquisition system of the load frame apparatus which provides a quasi-equilibrium geometric model for the implant, and converts the load-displacement raw data to implant geometry and engineering mechanical properties for digital or graphical display.",
                        "Using this invention, the load F (or force) measurements are acquired as a function of breast implant height or plate spacing H in a load frame apparatus as the plate spacing is dynamically changed. Breast implants generally have a height of about 10 centimeters (cm) or less; and with preferred load frame crosshead speeds of about 2.5 centimeters/minute (cm/min) to about 50 cm/min, the time to perform a test run can be very quick. With the load F and plate spacing H data, all breast implant geometric properties and engineering mechanical properties can be calculated knowing the constant breast implant volume V and shell thickness t of the breast implant shell, or enclosure. The breast implant volume V is typically provided by the breast implant manufacturer; however, a breast implant's volume V can be easily determined from the breast implant's mass M and the density p of the material(s) comprising the breast implant using the formula V=M/p. Since the method of this invention may only take a few minutes, and calculations from the data can be automated by computer program or spreadsheet, a full description of breast implant geometry and engineering mechanical properties can be obtained very quickly.",

The upper platen 201 and lower platen 202 of a load frame apparatus contact the breast implant 100 with a diameter d.

The manual (e.g., static) and automatic (e.g., dynamic) measurements on the same breast implant in FIG. 4 also illustrate an important novel feature of this invention, whereby an assumption of quasi-equilibrium can be applied accurately when measuring the load F and geometry of a compressed breast implant. This assumption of quasi-equilibrium is validated as shown in FIG. 4 by the close agreement between the manual, or static, measurements, whereby a load is applied in a stepwise and discrete method, allowing a static state of equilibrium to be achieved between each load F and plate spacing H measurement, and the automatic, or dynamic, measurements, whereby a load F is continuously or dynamically applied while recording the plate spacing H. A quasi-equilibrium process is one in which the deviation from equilibrium is infinitesimal, and all the states the breast implant passes through during the transient process may be considered equilibrium states. Therefore, the quasi-equilibrium assumption approximates all breast implant properties to be constants for every instantaneous compression load during the dynamic, or automatic, load-displacement test process or load program. These breast implant properties include the breast implant diameter D, breast implant H, breast implant surface area A, contact diameter d of the breast implant with the upper and lower plates, contact area of the breast implant with the upper and lower plates, and overall breast implant shape."

In FIG. 7, Breast implant #1 is a dual-lumen saline-filled breast implant in which the breast implant-platen area of contact is lubricated, Breast implant #2 is a gel-filled single-lumen breast implant in which the breast implant-platen area of contact is lubricated, and Breast implant #3 is another gel-filled single-lumen breast implant in which the breast implant-platen area of contact is lubricated."

The stress shown in FIG. 8 is the planform stress which is defined as the load divided by the planform area Ap=\u03c0D2/4, where D is the breast implant diameter. This corresponds to Equation 6, whereby the planform area Ap is used for A.

As shown in FIG. 9, an engineering modulus EpD based on the planform area stress Sp and diametric strain eD is plotted. The diametric strain is expressed as a percentage in FIG. 9, or Equation 9 multiplied by 100%. This modulus is defined as a tangent modulus, since it is the slope of the stress-strain curve. This particular modulus describes the shape stability of a breast implant, or its resistance to changing shape. The higher the modulus value, the higher the shape stability under compression. Other more traditional moduli are defined as the linear portion of a stress-strain curve as the stress and strain approach zero. This invention provides the means to determine all engineering moduli using only the load F and plate spacing H data from a load frame apparatus given a breast implant's constant volume V. In FIG. 9, Breast implant #1 is a dual-lumen saline-filled breast implant in which the breast implant-platen area of contact is lubricated, Breast implant #2 is a gel-filled single-lumen breast implant in which the breast implant-platen area of contact is lubricated, and Breast implant #3 is another gel-filled single-lumen breast implant in which the breast implant-platen area of contact is not lubricated."

It is also contemplated that this invention can be utilized during the design, development, production, or quality testing of other devices comprised of a monolithic or contiguous elastomeric matrix (i.e., devices that do not have a distinct enclosing shell), or devices comprised of an enclosing thin or thick-walled elastomeric shell filled with a fluid or gel.",

For example, for dual-lumen breast implant devices, the two shell-enclosed lumens are typically \u201cnested,\u201d with one shell-enclosed lumen contained within the lumen of, and sharing a common axis with, a second shell-enclosed lumen. There are breast implants comprised of dual lumen saline-filled silicone shells, breast implants having two lumens enclosed by shells having one lumen filled with silicone-gel and the other saline, and breast implants having two lumens each enclosed by silicone shells with one lumen filled with a fluid such as air and the other lumen filled with silicone gel or saline. This invention can be used to determine the geometric properties as well as the engineering stresses, engineering strains and engineering moduli for each of the shell-enclosed lumens comprising the multi-lumen elastomeric device or multi-lumen breast implant using quasi-equilibrium geometric models and engineering mechanical models such as Equations 1-10, wherein each shell-enclosed lumen can be characterized by a volume and shell thickness and separate geometric models. This invention can also be used to determine the overall geometric properties, engineering stresses, engineering strains and engineering moduli of a multi-lumen elastomeric device or breast implant when using the total volume (i.e., the volume of all shell-enclosed lumens comprising the elastomeric device or breast implant) of the multi-lumen elastomeric device or breast implant with quasi-equilibrium geometric models such as Equations 1-10.",
                                "It is also contemplated that this invention can be used as part of cyclic fatigue and ultimate strength testing of elastomeric devices to provide the elastomeric device designer a thorough understanding of the stresses and strains endured by the elastomeric device. During cyclic fatigue testing, elastomeric devices (e.g., breast implants) are cycled between two compressive loads with a frequency, in which one of the compressive loads could be zero or near-zero. Typically, cyclic fatigue load frequencies used for fatigue testing ranges from about 1 Hz to about 10 Hz, however this method could be used with any cyclic load frequency achievable by the load frame apparatus.",

For automated, or dynamic, load frame testing, typical crosshead speeds that can be used for this invention range from about 0.005 cm/min to about 100 cm/min, with preferred crosshead speeds ranging from about 2.5 cm/min to about 50 cm/min.",

Preferred sampling rates for this invention are about 1 to about 1000 samples per second.",

Typical in vivo forces on breast implants can reach about 1000 N, although higher forces may be possible during less common events such as automobile accidents or falling from a height.",

                                "When breast implants are inside the breast capsule, they are surrounded by synovial fluid which can provide a varying degree of lubrication at the breast implant-breast capsule interface. The degree of lubrication within a breast capsule can also vary by a person's specific physiology and the viscosity of the synovial fluid surrounding the breast implant in a breast capsule. Therefore, a preferred embodiment of this method is to test breast implants both with and without a lubricated interface between the breast implant and platens. Lubrication consists of applying a layer of aqueous solution, silicone oil or other lubricating fluid at the contact area interface between the load frame apparatus platens and the breast implant. Breast implants can also be tested using lubricants having a viscosity range expected to simulate the viscosity range of synovial fluid in a breast capsule, or by using synthetic synovial fluid. Testing breast implants with both lubricated and unlubricated interfaces with the load frame apparatus platens ensures that the engineering stresses, strains and moduli are characterized over the full spectrum of possible in vivo environments. In fact, during the development of this invention, it was discovered that the engineering stresses, strains, and moduli with lubricated and unlubricated breast implant-platen interfaces may be different.",
                                "It is also contemplated that this invention can be used to characterize the engineering mechanical properties of anatomically shaped breast implants, since although anatomically shaped breast implants are not symmetric in a zero-load state, these implants will deform to a flattened cylinder and the outer-half of a torus geometry when subjected to a compressive load between the two platens of a load frame apparatus.",

Preferably, the surface roughness for the platens should be in the \u201cpolished\u201d category, having a surface roughness on the order of about 1 micrometer or less.",
