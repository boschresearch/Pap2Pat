This particular model can be used, for example, to describe a correlation between transmitted and received signals in an unknown multi-path environment. Two signals can be sampled in a distributed setup. Each signal can be observed by a different sensor, which sends a certain number of non-adaptive and fixed linear signal measurements to a central decoder.",

The present disclosure also analyzes how the correlation induced by the sparse filtering can be exploited to reduce the number of measurements that are required for perfect reconstruction at the central decoder, but without any inter-sensor communication during the sampling process."

                                "Two signals can be linked by an unknown filtering operation, where the filter can be sparse in a time domain. This particular model can be used, for example, to describe a correlation between transmitted and received signals in an unknown multi-path environment. Two signals can be sampled in a distributed setup. Each signal can be observed by a different sensor, which sends a certain number of non-adaptive and fixed linear signal measurements to a central decoder.",
                                "The setup that is utilized in the present disclosure is conceptually similar to the Slepian-Wolf problem in distributed source coding, which consists of correlated sources to be encoded separately and decoded jointly. While a communication between encoders is precluded, a correlation between the measured data can be taken into account as an effective means to reduce the amount of information transmitted to the decoder.",
                                "The main difference between the proposed work and the classical distributed source coding setup is that the present disclosure studies a sampling problem and hence it may be only concerned about the number of sampling measurements that need to be taken, whereas the latter is related to coding and hence it uses bits as its \u201ccurrency\u201d. From the sampling perspective, the proposed work is closely related to the problem of distributed compressed sensing. In that framework, jointly sparse data are reconstructed based on linear projections computed by distributed sensors.",
                                "Certain aspects of the present disclosure use a novel correlation model for distributed signals. Instead of imposing any sparsity assumption on the signals themselves, it can be assumed that the signals are linked by some unknown sparse filtering operation. Such models can be useful in describing the signal correlation in several practical scenarios (e.g. multi-path propagation and binaural audio recoding). Under the sparse-filtering model, two strategies can be introduced for the design of the sampling system. In the universal strategy, the goal is to successfully sense and recover all signals, whereas in the almost sure strategy it can be allowed to have a small set (with measure zero) of unrecoverable signals.",
                                "For certain aspects of the present disclosure, the corresponding achievability bounds can be established on the number of samples that may be needed for the two abovementioned strategies. These bounds may indicate that the sparsity of the filter can be useful only in the almost sure strategy. Since those algorithms that achieve the bounds may be computationally prohibitive, it is introduced for certain aspects of the present disclosure, a concrete distributed sampling and reconstruction scheme that can recover the original signals in an efficient and robust way.",
                                "After a precise definition of the considered model, a general formulation of the distributed sensing problem can be stated. Then, it can be demonstrated that if one requires all possible vectors to be reconstructed perfectly, then the aforementioned correlation between the observed vectors cannot be exploited. In that case, the simple strategy of independently sending all coefficients of the distributed signals is optimal. However, if one only considers the perfect recovery of almost all vectors, then substantial gains in sampling efficiency may be achieved. An achievability bound may be derived for the almost sure reconstruction. Since the algorithm that attains the bound may be computationally prohibitive, it is proposed a sub-optimal, yet computationally efficient distributed algorithm based on annihilating filters. Moreover, it can be shown how the proposed method can be made robust in order to model mismatch using the Cadzow iterative procedure. Furthermore, several possible extensions and generalizations of the proposed modeling and recovery algorithms are discussed. Finally, several numerical experiments can be conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme in both synthetic and practical scenarios."

Using the sampling theory for signals with finite rate of innovation, the proposed model can be extended to piecewise polynomial and piecewise bandlimited filters. Moreover, the model may be extendable to filters which admit a sparse representation in an arbitrary basis. In this case, samples may be sent which involve random frequency measurements of the sparse filter. Then, the reconstruction may utilize techniques based on l1-based minimization in order to recover the filter with the complexity of O(N3). Once the filter is found, two sensors may send complementary frequency information of remaining frequency indices of their signals to the decoder.

The RIR generating algorithm is set in order to find reflections until the overall energy content of the filter is decreased by 20 dB (decibel) units.

After matching each estimated delay, that particular estimated delay can be removed from the list and the process can continue. Then, the error can be found in the position of each matched delay with respect to the true value. This error is normalized by the sampling period in order to convert the absolute error (in msec) to the error in the number of samples. The results are averaged over 500 trials.

It can be assumed that signals of the two hearing aids are related through a filtering operation. This filter can be referred as a binaural filter. In the presence of a single source in far field, and neglecting reverberations and the head-shadow effect, the signal recorded at hearing aid 2 is simply a delayed version of the one observed at hearing aid 1. Hence, the binaural filter can be assumed to have sparsity factor K=1. In the presence of reverberations and head shadowing, the filter from one microphone to the other is no longer sparse which introduces model mismatch. Despite this model mismatch, it can be assumed that the main binaural features can still be well captured with a filter having only a few non-zero coefficients. Thus, the transfer function between two received signals may be sparse, with the main peak indicating the desired relative delay.",
                                "FIG. 12A illustrates an audio experiment setup. A single sound source 1210, located at distance d from the head of a Knowles Electronic Manikin for Acoustic Research (KEMAR) mannequin 1220, moves back and forth between two angles \u03b1min and \u03b1max, as illustrated in FIG. 12B. The angular speed of the source 1210 is denoted as \u03c9. The sound can be recorded by microphones of the two hearing aids, located at the ears of the mannequin 1220. It is desired to retrieve the binaural filter between the two hearing aids at the hearing aid 1, from limited data transmitted by the hearing aid 2. Then, the main peak of the binaural filter indicates the relative delay between the two received signals, which can be used to localize the source. In addition to that, retrieving this binaural filter also allows the hearing aid 1 to find out the received signal at hearing aid 2. To get the head related transfer functions (HRTF) at each position of the sound source, the Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing (CIPIC) HRTF database can be used, which is a public-domain database of high-spatial-resolution HRTF measurements. The database includes 2500 measurements of head-related impulse responses for 45 different subjects.",

In this way, the near-sparse filter may be calculated in each frame with a few measurements, considering it as a 1-sparse filter. A weighted overlap-add (WOLA) filter bank may be used, which allows for an efficient realization of a DFT filter bank to obtain the short-time Fourier transform of the input signal.",

In the frame by frame processing, the HRTF for the left and right ears are extracted from the database. Then, each frame of length 1024 is windowed by a Hanning window and then filtered by the impulse responses to generate the received signals for the left and right ears. The overlap between the frames is set to a half of the window size.",

The analysis window is a Hanning window of size 896 samples, zeropadded with 64 zeros on both sides, to give a total length of 1024 samples. In each frame, the underlying impulse response may be estimated between the two ears, using the proposed distributed algorithm. Since it is desired to estimate the relative delay between two signals, it is set that K=1, i.e., search for just one Dirac. In order to overcome the model mismatch in the system, more measurements may be sent and the Cadzow's iterative de-noising procedure may be used followed by the TLS method. The parameter L is selected from the set L=5, 10, 15, 20, 25, which is much smaller than the frame length. This allows the left ear to localize the sound source in each frame by looking at the position of the main peak in the corresponding binaural filter. Moreover, it can reconstruct the signal received by the right ear using the frame-by-frame reconstruction approach.",

If the angular speed of the source is small compared to the frame length, the binaural filter does not change too rapidly over several frames. An exponentially weighted averaging filter can be used, with the averaging constant equal to \u03b1=200 ms. However, setting large values for a may degrade the tracking capability of the algorithm.",

Because of the reverberations and the shadowing effects, the binaural filter is not exactly sparse. Moreover, the frame-by-frame processing further distorts the binaural filter. Because of that, the over-sampling is preferably used to obtain a good approximation for the position of the main peak.",

FIGS. 14B-14F exhibits the sparse approximation to the filter, using different number of measurements (L=5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, respectively).

A possible solution may be to apply the proposed scheme on a sub-band basis, where the assumption is that only one source is active in each sub-band. However, the conjugate symmetry property can no longer be used to obtain twice as many consecutive frequency coefficients. Moreover, the over-sampling ratio must be reduced to keep a constant total number of coefficients. However, this is out of the scope of the present disclosure.",

The main focus is on the scenario where two signals are related through a sparse time-domain filtering operation. Under this model, the universal and the almost sure reconstruction strategies are proposed. Achievability bounds are derived on the minimum number of samples needed in each strategy and it is shown that, in the universal recovery, one can not use the sparsity of the filter to reduce the number of measurements. On the other hand, by means of a computationally demanding recovery algorithm, the number of measurements in the almost sure setup may be decreased effectively by N\u2212K. Since K<<N, this may be a substantial reduction in the number of measurements. In order to overcome the high complexity of the recovery algorithm, a robust, sub-optimal distributed sensing and recovery scheme is proposed based on annihilating filters, which needs effectively K more measurements compared to the bound but its complexity is of O(KN).",
