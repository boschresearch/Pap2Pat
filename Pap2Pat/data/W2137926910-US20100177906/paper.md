## INTRODUCTION

Two signals can be linked by an unknown filtering opera tion, where the filter can be sparse in a time domain. This particular model can be used, for example, to describe a correlation between transmitted and received signals in an unknown multi-path environment. Two signals can be sampled in a distributed setup. Each signal can be observed by a different sensor, which sends a certain number of non adaptive and fixed linear signal measurements to a central decoder.

The setup that is utilized in the present disclosure is con ceptually similar to the Slepian-Wolf problem in distributed Source coding, which consists of correlated sources to be encoded separately and decoded jointly. While a communi cation between encoders is precluded, a correlation between the measured data can be taken into account as an effective means to reduce the amount of information transmitted to the decoder.

The main difference between the proposed work and the classical distributed Source coding setup is that the present disclosure studies a sampling problem and hence it may be only concerned about the number of sampling measurements that need to be taken, whereas the latter is related to coding and hence it uses bits as its "currency'. From the sampling perspective, the proposed work is closely related to the prob lem of distributed compressed sensing. In that framework, jointly sparse data are reconstructed based on linear projec tions computed by distributed sensors.

Certain aspects of the present disclosure use a novel cor relation model for distributed signals. Instead of imposing any sparsity assumption on the signals themselves, it can be assumed that the signals are linked by some unknown sparse filtering operation. Such models can be useful in describing the signal correlation in several practical scenarios (e.g. multi-path propagation and binaural audio recoding). Under the sparse-filtering model, two strategies can be introduced for the design of the sampling system. In the universal strat egy, the goal is to Successfully sense and recover all signals, whereas in the almost Sure strategy it can be allowed to have a small set (with measure Zero) of unrecoverable signals.

For certain aspects of the present disclosure, the corre sponding achievability bounds can be established on the num ber of samples that may be needed for the two abovemen tioned strategies. These bounds may indicate that the sparsity of the filter can be useful only in the almost sure strategy. Since those algorithms that achieve the bounds may be com putationally prohibitive, it is introduced for certain aspects of the present disclosure, a concrete distributed sampling and reconstruction scheme that can recover the original signals in an efficient and robust way.

After a precise definition of the considered model, a gen eral formulation of the distributed sensing problem can be stated. Then, it can be demonstrated that if one requires all possible vectors to be reconstructed perfectly, then the afore mentioned correlation between the observed vectors cannot be exploited. In that case, the simple strategy of indepen dently sending all coefficients of the distributed signals is optimal. However, if one only considers the perfect recovery of almost all vectors, then Substantial gains in Sampling effi ciency may be achieved. An achievability bound may be derived for the almost sure reconstruction. Since the algo rithm that attains the bound may be computationally prohibi tive, it is proposed a Sub-optimal, yet computationally effi cient distributed algorithm based on annihilating filters. Moreover, it can be shown how the proposed method can be made robust in order to model mismatch using the Cadzow iterative procedure. Furthermore, several possible extensions and generalizations of the proposed modeling and recovery algorithms are discussed. Finally, several numerical experi ments can be conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme in both synthetic and practical scenarios.

### Signal Model and Problem Statement

Two signals X(t) and X(t) can be considered, where x(t) can be obtained as a filtered version of the signal x(t). In particular, it can be assumed that:

(1) is a stream of K Diracs with unknown delays t, k-1,..., K and coefficients c, k=1,..., K. The above model represented by equation ( 1) can characterize a correlation between a pair of signals of interest in various practical applications. Examples include the correlation between transmitted and received signals under a multi-path propagation, or the spatial correlation between signals recorded by two closely-spaced microphones in a simple acoustic environment composed of a single source.

For certain aspects of the present disclosure, a finite-di mensional discrete version of the model given by equation ( 1 Xin X (nT), where the sampling rate 1/T is set to be above the Nyquist rate O/L. In order to obtain a finite-length signal, a temporal window may be subsequently applied to the infi nite sequence Xn and the following may be obtained: afnix. In win?, for n=0, 1,..., N-1

(2

where win is a smooth temporal window (e.g. the well known Kaiser window) of length N.

It can be easily verified that the discrete Fourier transform of the finite sequence Xin may be expressed as: X, m) = (r. 6, fell for m=0, 1,...,N-1

(3

where x(w) and wy(w) are the discrete-time Fourier trans forms of X and w respectively. When N is large enough, the windowing effect may be omitted since w(w)/(27t) may approach a Dirac function 8(w) as N->OO. Then, it may follow from equation (3) that:

(4)

where X(w) is the continuous-time Fourier transform of sig nal x(t), and the equality is due to the classical sampling formula in the Fourier domain.

After applying the above procedure to signal X(t) and using model from equation (1), the following may be obtained:

X2m as is-(F) as Xin Him  The relationship given by equation ( 5) may imply that the finite-length signals X. In and Xin may be also approxi mately modeled as the input and output of a discrete-time filtering operation, where the unknown filter Hm in the frequency domain (the discrete filter hn in the time domain) may contain all information about the original continuous filter h(t). In general, the location parameters t, k=1,..., K from equation ( 5) can be arbitrary real numbers, and conse quently, the discrete-time filterhn may not be sparse. FIG. 1 illustrates a typical impulse response ofhn. However, when the sampling interval T is Small enough, it can be assumed that the real-valued delaySt, k-1,..., Kmay be close enough to the sampling grid, i.e., tsin T for some integers n, k=1,. . . . . K. Under this assumption, the filter hn may becomes a sparse vector with Knonzero elements that may be represented as: where h=(hO), .... hN-1)'e R is an unknown K-sparse vector, and ho-K. It can be often convenient to use the notation of a stacked vector x:=(x,x)e R". It can be denoted by Xa set of all stacked vectors such that its compo nents X and X satisfy equation ( 7) for some K-sparse vector h.

The problem of sensing x'=(x,x) can be considered in a distributed fashion by two independent sensors taking linear measurements of X and X, respectively. The measurement matrices may be fixed (i.e., these matrices do not change with input signals). As illustrated in FIG. 2, it can be Supposed that the i' sensor with a sampling matrix A, (i=1,2) may take M, linear measurements of X. Now, the following may be written:

where ye R" represents the vector of samples taken by the i' sensor, and A, is the corresponding sampling matrix. Con sidering the stacked vectory'-(y,y), then y=Ax, where:

It can be noted that the block-diagonal structure of matrix A given by equation ( 9) is due to the fact that X and X may be sensed separately. This may be in contrast to the centralized scenario in which X and X can be processed jointly and hence, the matrix A can have arbitrary structure.

The measurements y and y may be transmitted to the central decoder, which may attempt to reconstruct the vector X through some (possibly nonlinear) mapping up: R'" HX given as:

Now, a question to be answered can be what choices of sampling pairs (M. M.) may allow for reconstruction of signals XeX from their samples. Also, it can be beneficial to determine what is the loss incurred by the distributed infra structure from equation ( 9) over the centralized scenario in terms of the total number of measurements M+M, and how to reconstruct original signals from their samples in a com putationally efficient way.

Above questions can be first answered in the case of uni  Sure reconstruction and achievable sampling pairs for almost Sure reconstruction based on annihilating filters. Let A and A be the sampling matrices used by two sensors, and Abe the block-diagonal matrix as defined in equation ( 9). Initially, a focus may be on finding those matrices A and A. Such that every XeX is uniquely determined by its sampling data AX.

A sampling pair (M.M.) may be achievable for universal reconstruction if there are fixed measurement matrices Ae R"*" and Ae R" such that the following set is empty:

An intuition may suggest that, due to the correlation between vectors X and X the minimum number of samples that may be required to perfectly describe all possible vectors X can be made smaller than the total number of coefficients 2N. The following analysis shows that this may not be the CaSC.

It can be stated that a sampling pair (M.M.) may be achievable for universal reconstruction if and only if MN and MacN. In order to prove the previous statement, two stacked vectors x'=(x,x) and x'=(x', ''x'') may be con sidered, each stacked vector may follow the correlation model given by equation ( 7). These stacked vectors may be written under the following form: where C and Care circulant matrices with vectors handh' as its first column, respectively. From equation ( 12) it holds that:

Moreover, the following may hold:

When C-C is of full rank, the matrix from equation ( 14) may be of rank 2N. This may happen, for example, when C-2I and C-2I. In this case, X-X' can take any possible values in R*. Therefore, if the matrix A is not of full rank, there may be two different vectors x and x' with the difference in the null space of A, which provide the same measurement vector. Hence, a sufficient condition for the set defined in equation ( 11) to be empty may be that the block-diagonal matrix A is a MX2N-dimensional matrix of full rank, with Me2N. In particular, matrices A and A may need to be full rank matrices of size MXN and MaxN, respectively, with M.M.N. It can be noted that, in the centralized scenario, the full rank condition may still require to take at least 2N mea SurementS.

As a direct consequence of the above result for universal reconstruction, each sensor may just process its vector inde pendently without any loss of optimality. In particular, the simple strategy of sending all observed coefficients may be optimal. Moreover, it can be observed from the previous analysis that there may be no penalty associated with the distributed nature of the considered setup. In other words, the total number of measurements cannot be made Smaller than 2N even if vectors X and X can be processed jointly. The region of achievable sampling pairs for universal reconstruc tion is depicted as the area 410 in FIG. 4.

As shown in the previous analysis, the universal recovery may be a rather strong requirement to satisfy since it may be required to take at least N samples at each sensor, without being able to exploit the existing correlation. In many situa tions, however, it may be sufficient to consider a weaker requirement, which aims at finding measurement matrices that permit the perfect recovery of almost all signals from X. Therefore, a sampling pair (M.M.) may be achievable for almost Sure reconstruction if there may be fixed measurement matrices Are R'' and Ae R'' such that the set B(A, A), as defined in equation ( 11), is of probability Zero.

The above definition for the almost sure recovery may depend on the probability distribution of the signal x and the sparse filter h. For the following analysis, it may be sufficient to assume that the signal X and the non-Zero coefficients of the filter h have non-singular probability distributions over R and R* , respectively. The following analysis provides achievability bound of the number of samples that may be needed for the almost Sure reconstruction.

It can be stated that a sampling pair (M.M.) may be achievable for almost sure reconstruction if:

Memin{K--n, N, Memin{K--n, N, and where r=1 +mod(K2). Detailed analysis that confirms expres sions from relations (15) can be found in Appendix A.

Therefore, it can be shown that, in contrast to the universal scenario, the correlation between the signals by means of the sparse filter may provide a big saving in the almost Sure setup, especially when K3. This achievable bound for sampling pairs is depicted as the solid line 420 in FIG. 4.

#### Almost Sure Reconstruction Based on Annihilating

Filters It is shown in the analysis of Appendix A that the algorithm that attains the bound in relations (15) may be combinatorial in nature and thus, computationally prohibitive. Therefore, a novel distributed sensing algorithm is proposed based on annihilating filters. This algorithm may need effectively K more measurements with respect to the achievability region for the almost sure reconstruction but it may exhibit polyno mial complexity of O(KN).

For a noiseless scenario, the proposed distributed sensing scheme may be based on a frequency-domain representation of the input signals. The DFTs of the vectors x and X can be denoted by XeCY and XeCY, respectively. The circular con Volution in equation ( 7) may be expressed as:

where HeCY is the DFT of the filter hand (x) denotes the element-wise product.

The proposed approach may consist of two main steps. The first step may be to determine filter h by sending the first K+1 (1 real and K complex) DFT coefficients of X and X. The surely recover the unknown filter h using only K+1 DFT coefficients of X and X. This may be achieved using the approach based on annihilating filters. The DFT coefficients of the filter h may be given by: 2.

#### K Him = k=

The sequence Hm determined by equation ( 17) may rep resent the Sum of K complex exponentials whose frequencies may be determined by the positions n of the non-Zero coef ficients of the filter. It can be shown that Him can be anni hilated by a filter Am of degree Kwhose roots may be of the forme'"' for k=1,2,... K. More specifically, the coeffi cients of this filter may satisfy:

An: Hn= X AiFin -i = 0, i=0 or in matrix form:

The matrix from equation ( 19) is of size Kx(K+1) and it may be built from 2K consecutive DFT coefficients. More over, it can be shown that this matrix may be of rank K (see Appendix B for details) and hence, its null space may be of dimension one. Therefore, the solution may be any vector in the null-space of the above matrix.

It can be noted that, due to the conjugate symmetry prop erty, the coefficients of the matrix in equation ( 19) may be computed as:

Xin provided that Xm may be non-zero for m=0, 1,..., K. This may happen almost Surely if the distribution of X may be, for example, non-singular. Once the coefficients of the annihilat ing filter have been obtained, it may be possible to retrieve the unknown positions n. The filterweights c can then be recov ered by means of the linear system of equations ( 17). Based on the above considerations, the proposed distrib uted sensing scheme can be described as follows. FIG. 15 illustrates example operations 1500 for processing signals linked with a sparse filtering operation. At 1510, a first signal and a second signal may be sampled to obtain samples of the first signal X and samples of the second signal X. At 1520, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) may be performed on the samples of the first and second signals to obtain DFT coeffi cients of the first and second signals. At 1530, first L+1 DFT coefficients for each of the first and second signals and complementary subsets of remaining DFT coefficients for each of the first and second signals may be transmitted to a decoder, and wherein the first signal is an input in a sparse filter, the second signal is an output of the sparse filter, LaK, and K is a number of non-Zero elements of an impulse response of the sparse filter. FIG. 6 illustrates example operations 600 for performing sensing and recovery of signals based on annihilating filter technique. At 610, a decoder may receive from both signal sensors first K+1 DFT signal coefficients 510 (2K+1 real values each), as illustrated in FIG. 5. The decoder may also receive complementary subsets 520 (in terms of frequency indexes) of the remaining DFT coefficients (N-2K-1 real values in total), as illustrated in FIG. 5. At 620, the decoder may compute 2K DFT consecutive coefficient of the filter according to equation (20). At 630, the decoder may retrieve the filter impulse response husing the annihilating filter tech nique given by equations ( 17)-( 19). The missing frequency components ofx (respectively X) may be then reconstructed, at 640, from the available DFT coefficients of x(respectively X) using the equation ( 16).

It can be noted that in order to compute X m from XIm. the frequency components of the filter Him may need to be nonzero. This may be insured almost Surely with the assump tion that the nonzero elements of the filter h are chosen according to a non-singular distribution in R*.

A sampling pair (M.M.) may be achievable for almost Sure reconstruction using the efficient annihilating filter method if:

and

In contrast to the universal reconstruction, the total real number of measurements may be reduced from 2N to N+2K+ 1, as depicted as the dashed line 430 in FIG. 4. Although slightly oversampled compared to the bound for the almost sure setup represented by the line 420 in FIG. 4, a big advan tage may be obtained in computational efficiency.

The annihilating filter equation ( 19) is the known Yule

Walker system which is solvable in O(K) operations. In order to find locations of the nonzero coefficients, the anni hilating filter may need to be factorized. The roots of the filter can be found by the Chien search algorithm in O(KN) opera tions. In the last step, the weights of the nonzero coefficients of the filter may be obtained by solving the Vandermonde system with O(K) operations. Since K3N, the whole recon struction complexity of the sparse filter may be of O(KN).

Noise or, more generally, model mismatch can make the previously discussed solution rarely directly applicable in practice. Adding robustness to the system may require send ing additional measurements to the decoder.

A reconstruction in the noisy scenario may be based on a total least squares (TLS) approach in order to solve the system of equations in (19). In the TLS technique, it can be assumed that the observation errors may be on both sides of the system of equations. This approach may find the solution by mini mally perturbing both sides of the system of equations, until it is satisfied. The TLS approach may require the singular value decomposition (SVD) and the solution may be esti mated from the singular vectors.

In order to further improve robustness of the sensing algo rithm, the iterative Cadzow method may be utilized. FIG. 7 illustrates example operations 700 for iterative denoising, sensing and reconstruction of signals based on annihilating filters. At 710, the sensor i may transmit, at 710, the first L+1 DFT coefficients of x, (i=1,2) with LaK to a decoder. At 720, a matrix of dimension LX(L+1) of the form given by equation ( 19) may be then generated from these measurements. In the noiseless case, this filter matrix may have two key properties: it may have the rank K, and it may be Toeplitz matrix. In the noisy case, these two properties can be iteratively enforced.

The iterations may stop whenever the ratio of the (K+1)" singular value to the K" singular value of the filter matrix falls below a defined threshold value E (i.e., while where O, is k" singular value of the filter matrix).

At 730, the rank K of the filter matrix may be enforced by setting the L-K+1 smallest singular values to zero. At 740, the Toeplitz form of the filter matrix may be enforced by averaging the coefficients along the diagonals. The above procedure may converge to a matrix which exhibits the desired properties and may be closest to the initial noisy matrix in the Frobenius norm. The denoised DFT coefficients of the filter may then be extracted, at 750, from the first row and the first column of the filter matrix. At 760, the decoder may retrieve the filter impulse response h using the annihilat ing filter technique given by equations ( 17)-( 19). The missing frequency components of X (respectively X) may be then reconstructed, at 770, from the available DFT coefficients of X (respectively X) using the equation ( 16).

##### Possible Extensions

In the present disclosure, the correlation model is consid ered that consists of sparse filters in the time domain. Using the sampling theory for signals with finite rate of innovation, the proposed model can be extended to piecewise polynomial and piecewise bandlimited filters. Moreover, the model may be extendable to filters which admit a sparse representation in an arbitrary basis. In this case, Samples may be sent which involve random frequency measurements of the sparse filter. Then, the reconstruction may utilize techniques based on 1-based minimization in order to recover the filter with the complexity of O(N). Once the filter is found, two sensors may send complementary frequency information of remain ing frequency indices of their signals to the decoder. Another possibility to extend the model may be to consider general linear transforms which have a sparse representation in a matrix dictionary. Analysis of the present disclosure is based on distributed sensing in a single frame setup, where only one Snapshot may be available for sensing and reconstruction. However, it can be considered the case where multiple frames may be avail able and the sparse filters in different frames may be inter related throughjoint sparse models. In this scenario, the inter relation between the underlying K-sparse filters in different frames may be exploited in the sensing and recovery archi tecture. This may allow to either reduce the total number of measurements or, to make the reconstruction more robust to noise and model mismatch. It can be shown how to use the inter-relation between sparse signals of different frames in the annihilating filter based reconstruction method. In the case of random frequency measurements followed by the 1-based recovery method, different techniques may be used to exploit the potential redundancy in the multiframe scenario. Thus, the techniques provided herein may be utilized in a variety of applications. For certain aspects, the techniques presented herein may be incorporated in a headphone or other type headset with processing logic to perform the techniques provided herein and elements for generating audible signals based on reconstructed signals and/or microphones capable of processing signals to be transmitted to such a device for playback. Other applications include medical applications, for example, where the techniques presented herein may be incorporated in medical devices, such as sensors to monitor patient vital signs, and monitor devices with user interfaces to present readings from Such sensors.

##### Numerical Experiments

Numerical simulations are conducted in order to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed sensing and recovery scheme based on annihilating filters. The simula tions are divided into three parts. First, simulations are run using synthetic data and additive white Gaussian noise. Then, the proposed sensing and recovery algorithm is applied in order to estimate an acoustic room impulse response (RIR) generated by the image-Source model. Finally, the perfor mance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in a distrib uted audio processing application where the goal is to localize a Sound source using two headphones or other type headsets aid microphones as sensors.

For simulations based on synthetic data, it can be assumed that the signal x is of length N=256 and the sparse filter has K=3 or 5 non-zero coefficients. The elements of the signal X and the non-zero coefficients of the filter may be chosen to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random vari ables with distribution N(0,1). The positions of the nonzero coefficients of filter h may be chosen uniformly. Independent white Gaussian noise can be added to the filter in order to meet a desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

It can be also assumed, for simulations based on synthetic data, that the first sensor may send the whole signal X. The normalized mean square error (MSE) may be calculated as the 12 norm of the difference between an original signal and a reconstructed signal, divided by the total energy of the origi nal signal, averaged over 50,000 realizations. FIG. 8A illus trates the normalized MSE on the reconstruction of signals as a function of SNR using the TLS approach, with or without the previously introduced Cadzow denoising procedure. The different sets of plots in FIG. 8A correspond to different oversampling factors: L=K+1 (plots 810 and 820), K+4(plots 830 and 840), and K+12(plots 850 and 860).

It can be observed that the normalized MSE can be signifi cantly reduced by sending only a few more measurements than the required minimum. Besides, the gain provided by the proposed iterative denoising procedure may increase as the Numerical experiments are also conducted in order to esti mate a room impulse response in an acoustic environment, by using the proposed algorithm. The synthetic room impulse response can be generated by the known image-source model (ISM). This scheme provides realistic impulse responses which can be used to generate signals that would effectively be recorded in the considered environment. The setup is illustrated in FIG. 9A. The room 910 has dimensions x, 5 m, y, 4 m, and Z, 3 m. The reflection coef ficients of all six walls are set to 0.6. The sound source 912 is located at coordinates X 2 m, y 2 m and Z=1.5 m. The microphone 914 is put at coordinates X 4 m, y, 3 m and Z=1.5 m. The speed of sound is set to c=340 m/s and the sampling frequency is f. 16 kHz. The RIR generating algo rithm is set in order to find reflections until the overall energy content of the filter is decreased by 20 dB (decibel) units. Also, the RIRsynthesis algorithm makes use of the fractional delay filters, which allow the representation of non-integer delays for all acoustic reflections. The synthesized RIR is illustrated in FIG. 9B which consists of 150 reflections.

The signal x n can be built with i.i.d. elements with distribution N(0,1). In order to simulate imperfections in sending these sequences through the loudspeaker, the white Gaussian noise can be added to it in order to reach SNR of 25 dB. Moreover, after convolving the noisy version of X. In with the RIR, another noise sequence can be added to Xn in order to get SNR=25 dB on the recorded samples. In this way, the conducted simulation is closer to a real scenario.

In the reconstruction phase, it can be assumed that the first sequence Xn is fully available to the recovery system. In order to estimate the RIR, it is set K=12 and different over sampling factors L=48, 84, 120 and 156 on Xin can be tested. Since the true reflection delays are real valued, it can be set the root finding part in the annihilating filter method in order to look for the roots with the machine numerical preci Sion. In this way, the proposed algorithm is able to find the true delays even if they do not lie on the sampling grid. The original RIR (i.e., plot 1010) and the reconstructed RIRs (plots 1020, 1030, 1040, and 1050 for L=156,120, 84 and 48, respectively) are illustrated in FIG. 10. It can be visually Verified that taking more measurements may result in better reconstruction quality.

FIG. 11 illustrates the average error (normalized to the sampling period) of estimating positions of the first ten stron gest reflections of the originally synthesized RIR, using the annihilating filter technique. The represented results in FIG. 11 are obtained by finding the closest estimated delay to the true delay, starting from the strongest one. After matching each estimated delay, that particular estimated delay can be removed from the list and the process can continue. Then, the error can be found in the position of each matched delay with respect to the true value. This error is normalized by the sampling period in order to convert the absolute error (in msec) to the error in the number of samples. The results are averaged over 500 trials. FIG. 11 clearly shows the effect of higher oversampling on the performance of the recovery algorithm.

In a practical simulation scenario, it can be considered the signals recorded by two hearing aids mounted on the left and right ears of the user. It can be assumed that signals of the two hearing aids are related through a filtering operation. This filter can be referred as a binaural filter. In the presence of a single source in far field, and neglecting reverberations and the head-shadow effect, the signal recorded at hearing aid 2 is simply a delayed version of the one observed at hearing aid 1. Hence, the binaural filter can be assumed to have sparsity factor K=1. In the presence of reverberations and head shad owing, the filter from one microphone to the other is no longer sparse which introduces model mismatch. Despite this model mismatch, it can be assumed that the main binaural features can still be well captured with a filter having only a few non-zero coefficients. Thus, the transfer function between two received signals may be sparse, with the main peak indi cating the desired relative delay. FIG. 12A illustrates an audio experiment setup. A single sound source 1210, located at distanced from the head of a Knowles Electronic Manikin for Acoustic Research (KE MAR) mannequin 1220, moves back and forth between two angles C, and C, as illustrated in FIG. 12B. The angular speed of the source 1210 is denoted as (). The sound can be recorded by microphones of the two hearing aids, located at the ears of the mannequin 1220. It is desired to retrieve the binaural filter between the two hearing aids at the hearing aid 1, from limited data transmitted by the hearing aid 2. Then, the main peak of the binaural filter indicates the relative delay between the two received signals, which can be used to local ize the source. In addition to that, retrieving this binaural filter also allows the hearing aid 1 to find out the received signal at hearing aid 2. To get the head related transfer functions (HRTF) at each position of the sound source, the Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing (CIPIC) HRTF database can be used, which is a public-domain database of high-spatial-resolution HRTF measurements. The database includes 2500 measurements of head-related impulse responses for 45 different subjects.

In order to track the binaural impulse response, the received signals are processed frame by frame in DFT filter bank architecture. In this way, the near-sparse filter may be calculated in each frame with a few measurements, consider ing it as a 1-sparse filter. A weighted overlap-add (WOLA) filter bank may be used, which allows for an efficient realiza tion of a DFT filter bank to obtain the short-time Fourier transform of the input signal.

The parameters of the simulation setup are as follows. The sound source is located at the distance d=1 meter in front of the head, at elevation 0. It travels between C=-45° and C-45° with the angular speed of ()=18 deg/sec. The total length of the sound is 10 seconds. In the frame by frame processing, the HRTF for the left and right ears are extracted from the database. Then, each frame of length 1024 is win dowed by a Hanning window and then filtered by the impulse responses to generate the received signals for the left and right ears. The overlap between the frames is set to a half of the window size.

On the reconstruction phase, the WOLA filter bank archi tecture is used. In this exemplary implementation, the sam pling frequency is set to 16 kHz. The analysis window is a Hanning window of size 896 samples, Zeropadded with 64 Zeros on both sides, to give a total length of 1024 samples. In each frame, the underlying impulse response may be esti mated between the two ears, using the proposed distributed algorithm. Since it is desired to estimate the relative delay between two signals, it is set that K-1, i.e., search for just one Dirac. In order to overcome the model mismatch in the sys tem, more measurements may be sent and the Cadzow's iterative de-noising procedure may be used followed by the TLS method. The parameter L is selected from the set L-5, 10, 15, 20, 25, which is much smaller than the frame length.

This allows the left ear to localize the sound source in each frame by looking at the position of the main peak in the corresponding binaural filter. Moreover, it can reconstruct the signal received by the right ear using the frame-by-frame reconstruction approach.

The reconstruction can be made more robust to noise and model mismatch by averaging the measurements along mul tiple frames. If the angular speed of the Source is Small com pared to the frame length, the binaural filter does not change too rapidly over several frames. An exponentially weighted averaging filter can be used, with the averaging constant equal to C. 200 ms. However, setting large values for a may degrade the tracking capability of the algorithm. 13A illustrates, as an example, the binaural filter, and FIG. 13B illustrates its approximation as one-tap filter, esti mated by the reconstruction algorithm using L 20 measure ments. Because of the reverberations and the shadowing effects, the binaural filter is not exactly sparse. Moreover, the frame-by-frame processing further distorts the binaural filter. Because of that, the over-sampling is preferably used to obtain a good approximation for the position of the main peak.

FIGS. 14A-14F demonstrates the localization performance of the algorithm. FIG. 14A illustrates the evolution of the original binaural impulse response over time. FIGS. 14B-14F exhibits the sparse approximation to the filter, using different number of measurements (L=5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, respec tively). This clearly demonstrates the effect of the oversam pling factor on the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm.

When multiple sources are concurrently active, the binau ral filter may not be sparse any longer. Therefore, the pro posed scheme can not be applied directly. A possible Solution may be to apply the proposed scheme on a Sub-band basis, where the assumption is that only one source is active in each Sub-band. However, the conjugate symmetry property can no longer be used to obtain twice as many consecutive frequency coefficients. Moreover, the over-sampling ratio must be reduced to keep a constant total number of coefficients. How ever, this is out of the scope of the present disclosure.

The task of recovering distributed signals at a central decoder based on linear measurements obtained by distrib uted sensors is investigated in the present disclosure, using a fixed linear measurement structure. The main focus is on the scenario where two signals are related through a sparse time domain filtering operation. Under this model, the universal and the almost Sure reconstruction strategies are proposed. Achievability bounds are derived on the minimum number of samples needed in each strategy and it is shown that, in the universal recovery, one can not use the sparsity of the filter to reduce the number of measurements. On the other hand, by means of a computationally demanding recovery algorithm, the number of measurements in the almost Sure setup may be decreased effectively by N-K. Since K3N, this may be a Substantial reduction in the number of measurements. In order to overcome the high complexity of the recovery algo rithm, a robust, Sub-optimal distributed sensing and recovery scheme is proposed based on annihilating filters, which needs effectively K more measurements compared to the bound but its complexity is of O(KN).

### APPENDIX A

The Achievable Bound for Almost Sure Reconstructions

Achievability result for the almost sure reconstruction is shown in this appendix. The spark of a matrix A, denoted as S(A), can be defined as the largest integer L. Such that every Sub-group of L columns from A are linearly independent. It can be shown that, using a measurement matrix with its spark of at least K+1, it can be possible to almost Surely reconstruct K-sparse signals with only K+1 measurements. The proof will follow in the further text. Furthermore, let he be a K-sparse vector with the non-zero coefficients chosen from a non-singular distribution in R*. In addition, let A be a matrix with N columns satisfying S(A)K+1. Then, almost surely the sparse vector h can be reconstructed from measurements y=Ah.

It can be assumed, without loss of generality, that non-zero coefficients of hlie on the first Kindices I={1,2,..., K}. The measurement vectory lives in the span of the columns of A indexed by I. These columns can be denoted by A, and defined aS A, A SpanA). ( 22)

The combinatorial search algorithm may go through all possible Subspaces and check to which one the measurement vectory belongs. Let I' be any other set of indices different from 1 with cardinality K. Since S(A)K+1, the dimension of the union of the two Subspaces A and A Satisfies:

It can be easily verified that:

Meanwhile, since dim(A)-dim(A)=K, the following may hold:

On the other hand, the linear independency of the columns of A and the non-singular probability distribution of the non-Zero elements of h may result in a non-singular distribu tion on A. Thus, this intersection set of dimension less than K may have a total probability of zero in A. Since the number of subspaces can be finite, the total probability of the set of points in A which also live in any other subspace I' may be Zero. Thus, there is almost Surely one-to-one relationship between the measurements y and the sparse vector h. In general, the recovery algorithm may need to search through (...) possible Subspaces and check to which one the measurement vectory belongs. Therefore, the recovery algorithm is com binatorial in nature and computationally prohibitive.

In order to prove the achievability result for almost sure reconstruction, the sensing and recovery architecture can be divided into two parts. First, two sensors may send frequency measurements to the decoder to find the underlying K-sparse filter h. For fixed values of N and K, the structure of this part does not change by choosing different values for the number of measurements M and M in the achievability region. Sec ond, sensors may transmit complementary Subsets of the DFT coefficients to be used for constructing the two signals X and X. The sensors may adjust their share on this part of linear measurements in order to reach the required rates M and M. The achievability results can be shown in two separate situ ations, corresponding to whether K is an odd or an even number.

First, when K is odd, the matrix M of size K+ 1 1XN

( 5-+ }x may be defined as:

Two sets of measurements, denoted asy,' and y', may be given by: where F is the DFT matrix of size NXN. The number of real measurements in equation ( 27) is K+2 for each sensor, com posed of one real DC component plus (K-1)/2 complex fre quency components.

In order to reconstruct the sparse filter h, the central decoder may compute consecutive frequency components of h in the index range

This may be done by dividing two sets of measurements in equation ( 27) index by index and making use of the complex conjugate property of the Fourier transform of the real sequences. It can be noted that this division can be allowed as long as the denominator is not Zero. This may be insured almost Surely for the signal X, which is drawn from a non singular distribution in R. In fact, it may be required that the frequency components of X be nonzero in the range S. In the matrix form, the following may be obtained:

where His the Fourier transform of h in the range given by S.

The matrix W is a Vandermonde system of size (K+2)xN which consists of (K+2) consecutive rows of the DFT matrix, corresponding to the indices in the set S. Thus, by the prop erties of Vandermonde matrices, the following may be obtained:

It can be noted that the non-zero elements of h may satisfy a non-singular distribution in R*. Therefore, it can be pos sible to find the K-sparse filter h from y' and y, almost

Surely.

The sensors may send complementary Subsets of the remaining frequency information of their signals X and X to the decoder. By having access to the frequency information of one of the signals X, i=1,2 the decoder may use the point-wise relationship: in order to get the frequency content of the other sequence, with the help of the known filter h. It can be noted that since the non-Zero elements of h may satisfy a non-singular distri bution in R', the frequency components of the filter may be all nonzero almost surely. Therefore, it is possible to find Xm from Xm or Vice-versa. The two sensors may share the rest of the frequency indices to reach any point on the achievability region. It can be noted that equation ( 30) also allows the decoder to calculate the real (imaginary) part of Xm by knowing the imaginary (real) part of the other sequence Xm and Vice-versa. This is achieved by equating the real and imaginary parts in equation ( 30) and Solving a linear system of equations.

In this way, each sensor may send K-2 real measurements for the decoder in order to find the underlying sparse filterh almost Surely. Moreover, the sensors may send complemen tary information to the decoder. This may indicate that the sensors can choose the sampling pairs given by K+2sMsN and M-K--2+N-M. Therefore, the algorithm described above attains any point on the achievability region that is previously defined.

The same measurement and reconstruction techniques can be applied when K is even. In this case, however, the K-sparse (30) 1.
