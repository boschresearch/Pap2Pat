                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of bacterial cell-cell communication that relies on the production, release, detection, and response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. QS allows groups of bacteria to synchronously alter behavior in response to changes in the population density and species composition of the vicinal community. QS controls collective behaviors including bioluminescence, sporulation, virulence factor production, and biofilm formation.",
                        "In pathogenic bacteria that cause persistent infections, QS commonly activates virulence factor production at high cell density (HCD). However, in V. cholerae, which is the etiological agent of the acute disease cholera, production of HapR regulator at HCD represses genes important for virulence factor production and biofilm formation. This peculiar pattern of virulence gene regulation can be understood in terms of the disease. Following successful V. cholerae infection, the ensuing diarrhea washes huge numbers of bacteria from the human intestine into the environment. Thus, expression of genes for virulence and biofilm formation at low cell density (LCD) promotes infection, while repression of these genes by autoinducers at HCD promotes dissemination. Thus, molecules that activate QS have the potential to repress virulence in V. cholerae. March et al reported that pretreatment with commensal E. coli over-producing the V. cholerae autoinducer CAI-1 increased the survival rate of mice following V. cholerae infection [66], which further supports the idea of QS potentiators as drugs.",
                        "V. cholerae produces and detects two QS autoinducer molecules called CAI-1 and AI-2. CAI-1 ((S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one) is produced by the CqsA synthase and AI-2 ((2S, 45)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran borate) is produced by the LuxS synthase. Detection of CAI-1 and AI-2 occurs through transmembrane receptors CqsS and LuxPQ, respectively. CqsS and LuxPQ are two-component proteins that possess both kinase and phosphatase activities (FIG. 1 shows the CqsA/CqsS system). At LCD, when the receptors are devoid of their respective ligands, their kinase activities predominate, resulting in the phosphorylation of the response regulator LuxO. LuxO\u02dcP is the transcriptional activator of four genes encoding small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), Qrr1-4. The Qrr sRNAs target the mRNAs encoding the quorum-sensing master transcriptional regulators AphA and HapR. At LCD, facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq, Qrr1-4 stabilize and destabilize the aphA and hapR mRNA transcripts, respectively. Therefore, AphA protein is made while HapR protein is not (FIG. 1). When autoinducer concentration increases above the threshold required for detection (which occurs at HCD), binding of the autoinducers to their cognate receptors switches the receptors from kinases to phosphatases (FIG. 1). Phosphate flow through the signal transduction pathway is reversed, resulting in dephosphorylation and inactivation of LuxO. Therefore, at HCD, qrr1-4 are not transcribed, resulting in cessation of translation of aphA and derepression of translation of hapR. This QS circuitry ensures maximal AphA production at LCD and maximal HapR production at HCD. AphA and HapR each control the transcription of hundreds of downstream target genes. Hence, reciprocal gradients of AphA and HapR establish the QS LCD and HCD gene expression programs, respectively (FIG. 1).",
                        "Targeting response regulators as a broad-spectrum anti-infective strategy has been considered challenging because response regulator functions, such as phosphorylation and DNA binding, are thought to be specific. In spite of this, a handful of molecules that inhibit particular response regulator functions have been reported. Three inhibitors have been identified that target non-NtrC type response regulators, A1gR1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [50], Wa1R in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria [51], and DevR in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [52]. The molecules function by perturbing phosphorylation (A1gR1 and Wa1R) and DNA binding (DevR). Walrycins, molecules that inhibit the phosphorylation of the essential Wa1R response regulator, are active in suppressing growth in multiple Gram-positive bacteria.",
                        "LuxO, which is a member of the NtrC family of two-component response regulators, possesses an N-terminal regulatory receiver domain, a central ATPase domain (AAA+type), and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Two-component signaling (TCS) proteins are widely distributed in bacteria. In addition to their global importance in microbial physiology, the absence of TCSs in mammalian cells makes them attractive drug targets in pathogenic bacteria. Even though significant effort has been devoted to identifying novel TCS inhibitors, to date, none has been developed into a new class of anti-infective. Problems such as undesirable properties associated with lead molecules have been encountered [56,57]. In particular, inhibitors that generally target the conserved hydrophobic kinase domains of TCS histidine kinases suffer from drawbacks such as low cell permeability, poor selectivity, and unfavorable non-specific off-target effects (e.g. membrane damaging) [58,59,60]. By contrast, approaches to target the sensory domains of histidine kinases have yielded a handful of promising TCS inhibitors. For instance, LED209, an antagonist of the QseC histidine kinase, which regulates motility and pathogenicity in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, reduces virulence in several pathogens both in vitro and in vivo [61]. In addition, in Staphylococcus aureus, inhibitory Agr peptide analogs antagonize the AgrC histidine kinase receptors and block abscess formation in an experimental murine model [62]."

                        "We identified a set of small molecules that activate the QS system of V. cholerae. The QS-activating molecules may be classified as either QS receptor agonists or LuxO inhibitors. The LuxO inhibitors identified here function uncompetitively to perturb LuxO ATPase activity. Genetic analysis of LuxO mutants that are insensitive to the inhibitors suggests that the inhibitors interact with a region adjacent to the ATP binding pocket. Using a set of phenotypic assays, we showed that the inhibitors broadly activate different vibrio QS circuits and, in turn, repress virulence factor production and reduce cytotoxicity. Because LuxO is conserved among vibrio QS circuits, the molecules we characterize here are capable of inhibiting HSL-based and non-HSL-based vibrio QS systems. Numerous NtrC-type proteins homologous to LuxO act in two-component signaling systems and their roles in controlling nitrogen metabolism, virulence, motility, and other important processes have been extensively studied [37]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no previous report of a chemical probe that modulates the activity of a NtrC-family response regulator.",
                        "The LuxO inhibitors identified here possess certain favorable drug-like characteristics: potent inhibition, water-solubility, good stability, and cell-permeability. The molecules also display low host-cell cytotoxicity (undetectable cytotoxicity at 500 \u03bcM).",
                        "Use of pro-QS agents to treat acute infections, in which bacteria use QS to repress virulence is a focus of our invention. We show here that our synthetic pro-QS molecules reduce virulence by inhibiting LuxO. The invention encompasses use of CAI-1, LuxO inhibitors, or other QS-activating molecules as prophylactics to prevent V. cholerae or other pathogenic vibrios from initiating the LCD virulence gene expression program that is required for colonization. In this embodiment, inhibiting the launch of virulence factors would provide sufficient time for the host immune system to eliminate the pathogen. In contrast to traditional antibiotics that target essential bacterial processes, growth is not affected by interfering with QS, so development of resistance could potentially be minimized. Thus, just as antagonizing QS in bacteria is an alternative to traditional antibiotics, so is the use of pro-QS agents.",
                        "Vibrio species detect a wide array of autoinducers (HSLs, CAI-1, and AI-2), thus, molecules that interrupt QS in Vibrio species by targeting the cognate receptors/synthases are likely to be autoinducer-specific and will have a limited spectrum. By contrast, because LuxO is nearly identical in all Vibrio species, our inhibitors can broadly activate vibrio QS irrespective of what type of autoinducer is detected. QS plays an essential role in virulence in other pathogenic vibrios such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus. The components of the QS circuits in these species are similar to those of V. cholerae. Therefore, our invention focuses on QS-activating molecules identified for V. cholerae that find broad use for controlling diseases caused by other vibrios. We show here that treatment of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus with the LuxO inhibitors reduces virulence factor production and impedes cytotoxicity. Thus, our LuxO inhibitors, upon refinement as the particular use requires, can at a minimum be used broadly to control virulence factor production in a variety of Vibrio species that use QS to repress pathogenesis.",
                        "LuxO belongs to the NtrC protein family, \u03c354-binding transcriptional activators that rely on ATP hydrolysis to promote open complex formation. Although these broadly-active LuxO inhibitors are not broad-spectrum NtrC-type inhibitors, our invention encompasses use of the LuxO inhibitors as preliminary scaffolds for building a general NtrC-type response regulator (RR) inhibitor. Structure-activity relationships of the thio-azauracil core, combined with simultaneously screening for molecules that inhibit LuxO and other NtrC type response regulators are envisioned.",
                        "The central ATPase module of the NtrC-type RR is classified as AAA+ type [63]. This module is present in multiple domains of life. For example, AAA+ ATPases are important in functions including protein unfolding and degradation (ClpXP, FtsH, and p97), organelle function and maintenance (PEX1 and VPS4), replication and recombination (RuvBL1 and helicases), and intracellular transport (Dyneins). Some eukaryotic AAA+ ATPases have been proposed to be drug targets [64]. Therefore, we contemplate that the thio-azauracil core discovered here can be developed into an inhibitor of AAA+ ATPases across different domains.",

The luxOD47E reading frame of the resulting plasmid (WN2029) was randomly mutated using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit. The resulting mutagenized luxOD47E plasmid library was introduced into a V. cholerae \u0394luxO strain by conjugation. Individual colonies from this V. cholerae luxOD47E mutant pool were arrayed into 96-well plates containing LB medium with 100 \u03bcM compound 12. The V. cholerae \u0394luxO strain harboring non-mutated luxOD47E was grown in the absence of compound 12 to provide the reference for background light production. Following overnight static incubation at 30\u00b0 C., clones that produced light comparable to the background were selected and re-tested in the presence and absence of compounds 11 and 12. DNA sequencing was used to determine the alterations in luxOD47E for inhibitor-resistant mutants.

                        "We identified small molecules that activate QS in V. cholerae, in order to induce the HCD state and thus repress virulence factor production. We developed a whole-cell high-throughput screen that relies on QS-dependent induction of bioluminescence (lux) in V. cholerae [22]. We exploited V. cholerae mutants genetically locked into the LCD state and carrying the lux operon to screen for molecules that induce light production, indicating that they activate QS responses. We performed the screen on two different LCD mutants. The first mutant lacks the two autoinducer synthases, CqsA and LuxS. Therefore, both CqsS and LuxPQ QS receptors function as kinases and constitutively phosphorylate LuxO, resulting in repression of HapR. No transcription of the lux operon occurs, and this strain is dark. The second strain carries the luxOD47E allele. This luxO mutation mimics LuxO\u02dcP, rendering LuxO constitutively active [23,38]. Therefore, HapR is repressed and the strain is dark. We identified two classes of molecules that could induce light production. Class 1 molecules induce bioluminescence in the double synthase mutant but not in the luxOD47E mutant. These compounds act as QS receptor agonists. Class 2 molecules induce bioluminescence in both the double synthase mutant and the luxOD47E mutant. Class 2 compounds likely target QS components that lie downstream of the receptors. We screened 90,000 molecules and identified eight Class 1 compounds and three Class 2 compounds (FIGS. 2A and 2B). The EC50 of Class 1 compounds are comparable to that of CAI-1 and generally lower than those of Class 2 compounds (FIG. 2C). These differences support the idea that the two classes of molecules potentiate QS responses by distinct mechanisms. None of the compounds affected cell growth."

These three compounds are structurally homologous (FIG. 2A); therefore, it appeared likely that they function by an identical mechanism. We focused on the compound displaying the highest potency (i.e., compound 11, FIG. 2B-C). Class 2 compounds could potentially target one or more of the V. cholerae QS cytoplasmic components that function downstream of the receptors: LuxO, \u03c354, Hfq, and/or Qrr1-4. We reasoned that if these compounds interfere with LuxO or \u03c354, transcription of qrr1-4 would decrease in the presence of the inhibitors. By contrast, if the compounds target Hfq or act directly on Qrr1-4, they should not affect qrr1-4 transcription. Results showed GFP production from a qrr4-gfp transcriptional fusion decreased \u02dc3-fold when the luxOD47E strain was treated with compound 11 (FIG. 2D). This result suggested that compound 11 targets either LuxO or \u03c354. If the target of compound 11 is \u03c354, transcription of other \u03c354-dependent genes should be affected when V. cholerae is treated with the compound. We examined transcription of the \u03c354-dependent gene vpsR [41] and found that it did not change significantly in the presence of compound 11. These results suggested that compound 11 targets LuxO."

In addition, several 5-thio-6-azauracil analogs with other modifications on their side chains displayed weak or no activity in the screen. Therefore, differences in the hydrocarbon side chains must be responsible for the corresponding differences in potency with compounds harboring branched side chains displaying greater potency (i.e., compound 11, FIG. 2C). To explore the relationship between structure and activity, we synthesized a focused library of compounds bearing the conserved 5-thio-6-azauracil core, and we altered the branching in the side chains. We measured activities using bioluminescence in the V. cholerae luxOD47E mutant. Several of the side chain modifications decreased potency (as shown by an increase in EC50, FIG. 3). However, increasing steric bulk by incorporation of a tert-butyl carbinol side chain led to a 3-fold enhancement in potency (i.e., compound 12, FIG. 3). Thus, the activity of the 5-thio-6-azauracil compounds within this series is highly sensitive to the structural features of the alkyl side chain.

We investigated which of these activities is inhibited by compounds 11 and 12. First, using whole-cell bioluminescence assays, we found that both compounds activate QS in V. cholerae strains expressing either wild type LuxO or LuxO D47E (FIGS. 2B and 3). Wild type LuxO is activated by phosphorylation via the QS cascade, and the LuxO D47E variant, which mimics LuxO\u02dcP, while not phosphorylated is constitutively active. Because both wild type LuxO and LuxO D47E are vulnerable to inhibition, it cannot be the ability of LuxO to participate in phosphorylation or dephosphorylation that is impaired by compounds 11 and 12.",
                                "To examine if compounds 11 and 12 affect LuxO binding to DNA, we used electrophoretic-mobility-shift and fluorescence anisotropy assays to probe LuxO interaction with qrr promoter DNA. No significant change in LuxO D47E binding to qrr4 promoter DNA occurred in the presence of the inhibitors as judged by mobility shift (FIG. 4A). Quantitative fluorescent anisotropy assays revealed that, in the presence and absence of the LuxO inhibitors, LuxO D47E interacts with the qrr4 promoter DNA with an identical binding constant (\u2212300 nM) (FIG. 4B). Thus, binding to DNA is not altered by the inhibitors.",
                                "Finally, we examined whether compounds 11 and 12 affect LuxO ATPase activity. To do this, we used a coupled-enzyme assay [42] to assess the rate of ATP hydrolysis by LuxO in the presence and absence of the compounds. Both compounds inhibit ATP hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 5A-C). Using traditional Michaelis-Menton enzyme kinetic analyses, we found that both compounds decrease the Km and the Vmax of the LuxO ATPase reaction (FIG. 5B-C). The Lineweaver-Burk plots of curves derived from control reactions and from inhibitor-containing reactions display parallel slopes (Km/Vmax), indicating that compounds 11 and 12 function as uncompetitive inhibitors (FIGS. 5B-C), suggesting they bind to the pre-formed LuxO-ATP complex to inhibit ATP hydrolysis. Indeed, inhibition of LuxO ATPase by the analogs we identified or synthesized (as represented by % inhibition) is correlated with their potency (EC50) in inducing QS in the luxOD47E mutant (FIG. 5D). We conclude that the LuxO inhibitors discovered here activate QS in V. cholerae by specifically inhibiting the ATPase activity of LuxO. Presumably, in the presence of the inhibitors, LuxO is incapable of participating in open complex formation at the qrr promoters, which prevents transcription of the Qrr sRNAs. In turn, translation of HapR is derepressed and the QS response occurs prematurely."

To determine where compounds 11 and 12 bind, we screened for LuxO mutants refractory to inhibition. To do this, we engineered random mutations into the cloned luxOD47E gene and introduced the mutant library into a V. cholerae \u0394luxO strain carrying the lux operon. We screened for clones that conferred a dark phenotype in the presence of compound 12, hypothesizing that such mutants harbor alterations in the inhibitor binding-site. Four such mutants were identified (FIG. 6). These LuxO D47E variants are functional, as judged by their ability to repress light production in the absence of inhibitor (FIG. 6). Sequencing revealed that the four LuxO D47E mutants carry L211F, L215F, L242F, or V294L alterations, implicating these residues as important for binding of the inhibitors. We mapped these four alterations on the existing crystal structure of ATP-bound Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 (PDB:3MOE) [43], which displays high sequence homology to LuxO. The four residues we identified in the screen map to three regions that abut the predicted Walker B ATP-binding motif (D245, E246, L247, and C248 in LuxO). In other NtrC-type proteins, mutations in this region have been shown to prevent ATP hydrolysis. Thus, binding of compounds 11 and 12 to this region may induce a conformational change in the nearby ATP-binding pocket that inhibits ATP hydrolysis."

We exploited two well-characterized phenotypes controlled by QS: light production in V. harveyi and colony opacity in Vibrio parahaemolyticus [44,45,46]. In V. harveyi, light production is induced by QS and a V. harveyi luxOD47E mutant is dark. Treatment of V. harveyi luxOD47E with compounds 11 and 12 induced light production 10.000-fold, indicating that these compounds are indeed active in V. harveyi (FIG. 7A). In V. parahaemolyticus, the HapR ortholog, OpaR, controls colony opacity. OpaR production is repressed at LCD by LuxO\u02dcP via the V. parahaemolyticus Qrr sRNAs. V. parahaemolyticus mutants that produce low and high levels of OpaR form translucent and opaque colonies, respectively [32,46]. Thus, V. parahaemolyticus is naturally translucent at LCD and opaque at HCD. McCarter et al [32] identified a constitutively active LuxO mutant (LM4476, luxO*) in V. parahaemolyticus that confers a constitutive translucent colony morphology (FIG. 7B, left). By contrast, an isogenic V. parahaemolyticus \u0394luxO strain (LM9688) forms opaque colonies (FIG. 7B, left). When the luxO* mutant is plated on medium containing compound 11 or compound 12, the colonies switch from translucent to opaque, a phenotype indistinguishable from the \u0394luxO mutant (FIG. 7B, right). These results suggest that compounds 11 and 12 inhibit V. parahaemolyticus LuxO from repressing the OpaR-dependent QS program. We conclude that the LuxO inhibitors identified in this study are broadly capable of activating QS in Vibrio species that employ LuxO as the central QS regulator."

For example, in V. cholerae, the genes encoding the key V. cholerae virulence factors, the CTX toxin and the Toxin Co-regulated Pilus (TCP), are targets of HapR repression at HCD [17,27,30]. V. parahaemolyticus uses Type Three Secretion Systems (TTSS) for pathogenesis, and at HCD, OpaR represses the expression of one of the TTSS operons (TTSS-1) [32,47]. Thus, luxO mutants that constitutively produce HapR (V. cholerae) or OpaR (V. parahaemolyticus) are attenuated in virulence [22,30,32]. The previous section shows that our LuxO inhibitors are active in multiple vibrios. To test whether the inhibitors can disrupt the QS-controlled virulence outputs of pathogenic vibrios, we assayed their effects on TcpA production in V. cholerae and production and secretion of VopD, a TTSS-1 effector protein, in V. parahaemolyticus. Western blot analysis showed that, in a V. cholerae luxOD47E strain, HapR and TcpA levels increased and decreased, respectively, in the presence of compound 12 (FIG. 8A). Likewise, exposing the V. parahaemolyticus luxO* mutant to compound 12 resulted in decreased production and secretion of VopD (FIG. 8B).",

At 2 to 3 hours post-infection, HeLa cell lysis was significantly lower in samples infected with the luxO* mutant treated with compound 12 than in samples infected with the luxO* mutant that had not been treated (average cytotoxicity is \u02dc30% and \u02dc100% for treated and untreated, respectively, p<0.01). At that time point, the cytotoxic capability of the Compound 12-treated luxO* mutant is slightly higher than that of the isogenic \u0394luxO mutant (FIG. 8C). At 4-hour post-infection, the compound 12-treated luxO* mutant was equally toxic (\u02dc100%) as the untreated the luxO* mutant, while the \u0394luxO mutant caused only \u02dc60% HeLa cells lysis. Thus, the level of in vitro inhibition of TTSS-1 (FIG. 8B) is a good indicator of the ex vivo inhibition of cytotoxicity (FIG. 8C). The increase in cytotoxicity in Compound 12-treated V. parahaemolyticus that occurred at late time points could be due to incomplete inhibition of LuxO, uptake, or degradation of the compound by the HeLa cells. Nonetheless, the progression of V. parahaemolyticus killing of mammalian cells is impaired by compound 12, consistent with the notion that virulence factor production can be controlled by small molecule inhibitors of LuxO."

                        "We identified two classes of molecules that activate QS in V. cholerae. These newly identified molecules serve two important purposes. First, they can be used as novel chemical probes to study QS signal transduction mechanisms. Second, because QS represses virulence factor production in many pathogenic Vibrio species, these molecules, that activate QS, which decreases virulence, have the potential to be anti-virulence agents to combat infectious diseases caused by pathogenic vibrios.",
                        "The molecules identified as Class 1 act on the V. cholerae CqsS receptor. These molecules, surprisingly, do not resemble the native CAI-1 family of ligands (FIG. 2B). Previous studies revealed that CqsS receptors from different vibrios possess distinct ligand detection specificities. The V. cholerae receptor is promiscuous in detecting a range of CAI-1-type molecules, while the V. harveyi receptor is relatively stringent [39]. None of the Class 1 molecules identified here activates QS in V. harveyi, lending support to the idea that CqsS receptors, although sharing extensive homology, possess different overall stringencies for ligands. We altered a single specificity-determining residue in the V. cholerae CqsS receptor (Cys 170) to the corresponding amino acid (Phe) in the V. harveyi receptor. This alteration is sufficient to increase stringency in detection of CAI-1 type molecules [39,49], however, it did not abolish detection of the Class 1 molecules (FIG. 10). Identification of CqsS receptor mutants with altered selectivity to the Class 1 molecules will provide additional insight into the molecular basis of ligand-CqsS interactions.",
                        "The second class of molecules identified act on LuxO, the central QS regulator that controls transcription of the four Qrr sRNA genes. In contrast to previously identified LuxO inhibitors, our LuxO inhibitor molecules function by an uncompetitive mechanism, presumably by binding to the pre-formed LuxO-ATP complex to prevent ATP hydrolysis. Thus, multiple families of response regulator can be selectively inhibited using small molecules. Furthermore, all three known response regulator activities; phosphorylation, DNA binding, and ATPase, are potential targets for inhibition.",
                        "Analyses of LuxO inhibitor-resistant mutants suggest that our inhibitors bind to a region close to the predicted Walker B motif Additional support for this idea comes from studies of other NtrC-type proteins, which show that mutations that affect ATP hydrolysis but do not interfere with ATP binding also map to the Walker B motif and to amino acid residues preceding the conserved GAFTGA domain [43,53,54]. Indeed, one of the LuxO inhibitor-resistant mutations identified here (L242F) lies immediately upstream of the predicted Walker B motif, while both the I211F and L215F mutations map to the helix containing the GAFTGA domain. In addition, the residue identified in the final inhibitor-resistant mutant, V294L, is predicted to sit facing the putative catalytic arginine (R306). The GAFTGA domain is important for interaction with the \u03c354-RNAP holoenzyme [55]. Thus, it was possible that the mutations we isolated in this region (I211F and L215F) suppress inhibition by compounds 11 and 12 by stabilizing the LuxO-\u03c354-RNAP interaction without affecting inhibitor binding. If this were the case, the ATPase activity of the purified LuxO D47E/I211F and D47E/L215F variants would be inhibited by these compounds. However, we purified LuxO D47E/1211F protein and found that the ATPase activity is not inhibited (FIG. 11). This result is consistent with the idea that these mutations abolish inhibitor binding and, in so doing, prevent ATP hydrolysis.",
                        "High sequence conservation in the ATPase domain exists between different NtrC-type response regulator family members. We tested whether the LuxO inhibitors could inhibit other NtrC-type response regulators. Compounds 11 and 12 only modestly inhibit (\u02dc10%) the ATPase activity of purified E. coli NtrC at 250 \u03bcM (a concentration at which >80% of the LuxO ATPase activity is inhibited). This finding is surprising because the key residues (I211, L215, L242, and V294) that, when mutated, confer resistance to the inhibitors in LuxO are all present in E. coli NtrC. Thus, NtrC must possess additional structural features that render it resistant to inhibition. Structural comparisons between these two related response regulators, coupled with identification of inhibitor-sensitive NtrC mutants, should allow for an understanding of the basis of the differences in inhibitor sensitivity.",
                        "In the context of our work, the ATPase domain is highly conserved between all members of the NtrC response regulator family. Therefore, molecules that specifically target the ATPase domain of a single response regulator in this family (e.g., LuxO) could potentially be developed into general inhibitors of NtrC-family of proteins. Because NtrC-type proteins control virulence, nitrogen metabolism, motility, and other vital processes in bacteria [37], targeting the ATPase domain offers an additional route for anti-TCS drug development."
