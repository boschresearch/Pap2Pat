Lignin acts as a matrix material for polysaccharides, micro-fibrils and fibres and provides strength to plant stem.

                        "In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the development of new plastic materials being mixtures of well-known synthetic polymers, such as e.g. polyolefins, polyesters and polynitriles, and various forms of lignin. It follows that e.g. consumer products made of such mixtures are partly made of lignin. They may therefore be considered as more environmentally benign in comparison to the corresponding product made of a synthetic polymer, typically derived from non-recyclable fossil sources, as the only major constituent. Problems to be overcome with this type of mixtures include the relatively low general miscibility of lignin with various synthetic polymers, relatively low thermal stability of the intimate lignin and undesired properties of the resulting mixture, e.g. relatively low toughness, strain at break or tensile strength. Efforts have been devoted to addressing such problems by modification of the lignin employed, for example by adjustment of production parameters and by post-production chemical modification.",

Hardwoods tend to be slower growing and are therefore usually denser. Softwood trees are known as a gymnosperm. Gymnosperms reproduce by forming cones which emit pollen to be spread by the wind to other trees. A hardwood is an angiosperm, a plant that produces seeds with some sort of covering such as a shell or a fruit.",
