# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate H. pylori diagnosis

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- outline diagnostic method

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

- describe use of commercial IgG/M2 monoclonal antibody (antibody X) and IgG/M1 monoclonal antibody (antib

### DEFINITION

- define terms "test sample" and "device"

### Materials and Methods

- describe cell culture of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells
- describe transfection and lysis of HEK 293 cells
- describe culture conditions for H. pylori strains
- describe cloning of HP-NAPR77-E116 into an E. coli expression vector
- describe single site-directed mutagenesis
- describe expression and purification of recombinant HP-NAP and HP-NAP mutants
- describe production of recombinant MBP-HP-NAPR77-E116

## Example 1

### Detection of Helicobacter pylori Neutrophil-Activating Protein (HP-NAP) by the Antibody X

- detect HP-NAP by western-blot and ELISA

## Example 2

### Analysis of the Epitope of the Antibody X on HP-NAP

- identify epitope sequence on HP-NAP

## Example 3

### Detection of HP-NAP of H. pylori Strains, 26695, NCTC 11639, and NCTC 11637

- detect endogenous HP-NAP from different H. pylori strains

## Example 4

### Inhibition of HP-NAP-Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) from Human Neutrophils by the Antibody X

- inhibit HP-NAP-induced ROS production by neutrophils
