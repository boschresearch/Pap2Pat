## Example 1

### Detection of Helicobacter pylori Neutrophil-Activating Protein (HP-NAP) by the Antibody X

- introduce antibody X
- detect HP-NAP by western-blot
- detect HP-NAP by ELISA

## Example 2

### Analysis of the Epitope of the Antibody X on HP-NAP

- identify epitope region
- mutate epitope residues
- verify epitope sequence

## Example 3

### Detection of HP-NAP of H. pylori Strains, 26695, NCTC 11639, and NCTC 11637

- analyze HP-NAP conservation
- detect HP-NAP from different strains
- study effect of mutations on detection

## Example 4

### Inhibition of HP-NAP-Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) from Human Neutrophils by the Antibody X

- inhibit ROS production
- study antibody X as blocking antibody
- discuss therapeutic applications
