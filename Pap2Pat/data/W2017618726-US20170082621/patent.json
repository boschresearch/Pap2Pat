    "date": "2015-12-31 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention provides methods for diagnosing and treating Helicobacter pylori infection by using a monoclonal antibody to detect Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) and inhibit the activity thereof. The monoclonal antibody is an anti-FLAG antibody that binds to a specific epitope on HP-NAP for the detection of HP-NAP in its native form or denatured form. Furthermore, the present invention uses the anti-FLAG antibody to block HP-NAP-induced production of reactive oxygen species by human neutrophils. Thus, the present invention can be applied in clinical diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection as well as treatment of the infection via inhibiting Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation.",

                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "The present invention relates to methods for diagnosing and treating Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly relates to methods for detecting Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) and inhibiting the activity of HP-NAP by using an antibody.",
                        "2. The Prior Art",
                        "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that may infect around one-third of the people in the world. According to epidemiology reports, more than ten million people are infected with H. pylori among healthy population in Taiwan. In a host, H. pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of stomach and triggers inflammation. It is highly associated with the pathogenesis of acute and chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, duodenitis, lymphoma, gastric adenocarcinoma and other gastric cancers. In 1994, World Health Organization (WHO) declared H. pylori as a Class I carcinogen. Thus, infection by H. pylori has become an essential public health issue.",
                        "The commonly used clinical tests for H. pylori infection include biopsy, gastroscopy, and urea breath test (UBT) with the use of carbon isotopes. Laboratory tests also include the gastric tissue culture and serological test. However, the gastric tissue culture may easily yield false positive or false negative results due to the operation process; the urea breath test is too expensive for developing countries. Although diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed, this method is costly, time-consuming and not clinically applicable.",
                        "HP-NAP is a virulence factor produced by H. pylori strains. It is a dodecameric protein consisting of twelve identical subunits, each of which is a four-helix bundle with a molecular weight of 17 kDa. HP-NAP induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils through the activation of a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is also a ligand of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is involved in HP-NAP-induced release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in splenocytes. HP-NAP also stimulates neutrophils to produce myeloperoxidase, chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophil-endothelial adhesion. In addition, HP-NAP is able to activate monocytes and mast cells. The inflammatory mediators produced by these innate immune cells upon H. pylori infection can lead to gastric mucosal damage.",
                        "As a result, HP-NAP may be a potential target for diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection because of its important role in the pathogenesis of diseases initiated by H. pylori infection. Since there is an urgent need for fast and accurate diagnosis of H. pylori infection, development of new detection methods based on detecting HP-NAP may be the solution."

Another commercial IgG/M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, F-3040), designated as antibody Y, is used as a control. These antibodies, X and Y, can detect their original target proteins with the amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:1), also named a FLAG-tag. However, this sequence is not present in Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP). To determine whether HP-NAP could be detected by the antibody X, recombinant HP-NAP of H. pylori 26695, whole cell lysates of HEK293 cells overexpressing an original target protein of the antibody X as a positive control, and whole cell lysates of HEK293 cells were subjected to western-blot analysis by using the antibody X. The antibody Y, which could detect the original target protein of antibody X, was also used in western-blot analysis. As shown in FIG. 1, the recombinant HP-NAP was detected by antibody X as a protein band of 17 kDa using western-blot analysis. Both antibodies X and Y detected their target protein overexpressed in the HEK 293 cells and some non-specific proteins expressed in HEK 293 cells. However, the antibody Y could not detect recombinant HP-NAP by western-blot analysis. The black arrowhead shown in FIG. 1 indicates the target protein of antibodies X and Y; the white arrowhead indicates non-specific proteins detected by antibodies X and Y; the striped arrowhead indicates HP-NAP. These results indicated that antibody X could detect the denatured recombinant HP-NAP of H. pylori 26695 in addition to its original target protein.",
                                "Next, whether the recombinant HP-NAP of H. pylori 26695 could be detected by antibody X was examined using ELISA. As shown in FIG. 2, the antibody X could detect recombinant HP-NAP at concentrations from 10 ng/ml to 4,800 ng/ml. While the recombinant HP-NAP could be detected with a reasonable signal by antibody X at the concentration of 600 ng/ml, there is no detectable signal for using the antibodies Y and IgG isotype control at that concentration. This result indicated that the antibody X can recognize the native form of HP-NAP. Taken together, the antibody X can detect recombinant HP-NAP of H. pylori 26695 by using both western-blot and recombinant HP-NAP-based ELISA through the recognition of the denatured and native forms of this protein, respectively.",

The whole cell lysates which contained 4 \u03bcg of proteins from un-induced and IPTG-induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring the vector expressing recombinant HP-NAP and 1 \u03bcg of purified recombinant HP-NAP were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by western-blot. As shown in FIG. 3, only one protein band of 17 kDa was detected by the antibody X.

                                "To determine the location of epitope of the antibody X on HP-NAP, purified recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged protein containing residues Arg77 to Glu116 of HP-NAP (MBP-HP-NAPR77-E116), HP-NAP and MBP protein were subjected to western-blot analysis with antibody X. As shown in FIG. 4, the antibody X could detect recombinant HP-NAP (a protein band of 17 kDa) and MBP-HP-NAPR77-E116 (a protein band of 47 kDa) but not MBP protein. These results indicate that the amino acid residues ranging from Arg77 to Glu116 of HP-NAP can be detected by antibody X.",
                                "The antibody X recognizes the DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:1) peptide. However, there is no such amino acid sequence except the first three amino acids, DYK, present in HP-NAP. They are amino acid residues Asp98, Tyr99, and Lys100 of HP-NAP. To determine whether these three amino acid residues are required for the detection of HP-NAP by antibody X, Asp98, Tyr99, and Lys100 were mutated to Ala. Also, Glu103 and Lys104 were chosen for site-direct mutagenesis. For example, a mutation of the residue Asp98 of HP-NAP to Ala is represented as HP-NAPD98A. Then, the whole cell lysates of E. coli expressing the above mentioned HP-NAP mutants, HP-NAPD98A, HP-NAPY99A, HP-NAPK100A, HP-NAPE103A, and HP-NAPK104A, were subjected to western-blot analysis with antibody X. The amounts of the recombinant HP-NAP and its mutants in the whole cell lysates were quantified by ponceau S staining of the blotting membrane. The signal intensity of the HP-NAP mutants in western-blot was normalized to that of the wild-type HP-NAP.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 5, among the mutants generated, the antibody X could not detect HP-NAPD98A, HP-NAPY99A, HP-NAPK100A, and HP-NAPE103A mutants by western-blot analysis. These results indicate that the four amino acid residues, Asp98, Tyr99, Lys100, and Glu103, of HP-NAP are required for the detection of HP-NAP by the antibody X. In other words, D98Y99K100XXE103 (SEQ ID NO:2) is the epitope sequence on HP-NAP and is recognized by the antibody X. Although a control antibody Y could detect the amino acid sequence of DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO:1), this recognition was limited to the DYKDDDDK sequence (SEQ ID NO:1) located at the N-terminus of a protein. On the other hand, the antibody X of the present invention could recognize the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 at any position of a protein.",
                                "To determine if these residues are also required for the detection of HP-NAP by antibody X in recombinant HP-NAP-based ELISA, the HP-NAP mutants, HP-NAPD98A, HP-NAPY99A, HP-NAPK100A HP-NAPE103A, and HP-NAPK104A were further purified and used as coating antigens in ELISA. Since HP-NAPD98A is present as an insoluble protein, only the other four HP-NAP mutants were used as coating antigens in recombinant HP-NAP-based ELISA. As shown in FIG. 6, the antibody X at the concentration of 600 ng/ml could not detect HP-NAPY99A, HP-NAPK100A, and HP-NAPE103A mutants. Thus, the amino acid residues, Tyr99, Lys100, and Glu103, of HP-NAP are also required for the detection of native form of HP-NAP by the antibody X."

                                "As shown in FIG. 7, there are nine non-identical residues among the 114 amino acid residues of HP-NAP, whereas only three non-identical residues are found for the residues ranging from Arg77 to Glu116 of HP-NAP. To determine whether the antibody X could detect endogenous HP-NAP from different H. pylori strains, 1 \u03bcg of purified recombinant HP-NAP and the whole cell lysates which contained 48 \u03bcg of proteins from H. pylori 26695, NCTC 11639, and NCTC 11637 strains were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western-blot. As shown in FIG. 8, the antibody X could detect endogenous HP-NAP from the whole cell lysate of H. pylori 26695 strain with similar intensity to recombinant HP-NAP. However, the signal intensities of the endogenous HP-NAP from whole cell lysates of H. pylori NCTC 11639 and NCTC 11637 were much lower than that of H. pylori 26695 strain. Taken together, the antibody X could detect the endogenous HP-NAP of H. pylori strains 26695, NCTC 11639, and NCTC 11637.",
                                "The reason why the antibody X detects HP-NAP from all three H. pylori strains with different intensity might be due to the differences in the amino acid sequences of HP-NAP from these three H. pylori strains. As shown in FIG. 7, amino acid sequence alignment of HP-NAP between H. pylori strain 26695 and eleven other H. pylori strains shows that there are only two non-identical amino acid residues close to the epitope of antibody X on HP-NAP of H. pylori 26695. These two amino acid residues are Glu97 and Tyr101. We then generated two HP-NAP mutants named HP-NAPY101H and HP-NAPE97GY101H, which mimic HP-NAP of H. pylori strains NCTC 11639 and NCTC 11637 respectively (Table 2), to study the effect of such mutations on HP-NAP detection by antibody X.",

The amounts of the recombinant HP-NAP and its mutants in the whole cell lysates were quantified by ponceau S staining of the blotting membrane. The signal intensity of the protein band for each HP-NAP mutant detected by western-blot analysis was normalized to that for the wild-type HP-NAP.",

The results indicate that the different sensitivities of antibody X in detecting HP-NAP of different H. pylori strains comes from the variation in the amino acid sequences of HP-NAP.",

The results indicate that the antibody X can detect the native forms of the HP-NAPY101H and HP-NAPE97GY101H mutants with better sensitivities than their denatured forms.

                                "HP-NAP is able to trigger ROS production by human neutrophils (Evans et al., 1995; Satin et al., 2000). To determine whether antibody X can inhibit HP-NAP-induced ROS production by neutrophils, H2DCF-DA-derived fluorescence assay was applied to measure the intracellular ROS level. As shown in FIG. 11A, the antibody X at the concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml almost completely inhibit HP-NAP-induced ROS production by neutrophils. As shown in FIG. 11B, upon two hours of HP-NAP stimulation, the production of ROS was significantly inhibited by 93.2% in cells stimulated with HP-NAP pre-incubated with antibody X as compared to the HP-NAP-stimulated cells. These results indicate that the antibody X can serve as a blocking antibody of HP-NAP to inhibit its activity. Furthermore, HP-NAP can combine with anti-inflammatory agents, including but not limited to glucocorticoids, corticosteroids, T-cell blockers, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, alkylating agents, antifolates, antibiotics, and antibodies, for treating H. pylori infection.",
                                "The antibody X of the present invention inhibits HP-NAP-induced ROS production by neutrophils and serves as a blocking antibody of HP-NAP. It has been reported that HP-NAP binds to neutrophils via the structure of its C-terminus, especially the third and the forth helices which contains residues L69-L75 and S88-A113, and activates neutrophils. As mentioned, the antibody X can detect HP-NAP by recognizing the residues, D98, Y99, K100, and E103, on HP-NAP. Thus, the active site of HP-NAP should be located at the binding region for the antibody X at the forth helix of HP-NAP. In addition, it is considered that HP-NAP activates neutrophils to produce ROS through a PTX-sensitive GPCR. Thus, the antibody X of the present invention is able to block the binding of HP-NAP to the GPCR, and so inhibits HP-NAP-induced activation of neutrophil. Therefore, the antibody X of the present invention can inhibit the inflammatory responses initiated by immune cells that bear HP-NAP receptors.",
                                "According to the above mentioned examples, the antibody X can detect HP-NAPY101H and HP-NAPE97GY101H mutants in their native forms with a one-third or two-third lower sensitivity compared to the wild-type HP-NAP. On the other hand, the antibody X shows a much lower sensitivity to these two HP-NAP mutants in their denatured forms. This result indicates that the antibody X performs better in detecting native HP-NAP from different H. pylori strains. Due to the advantage of this HP-NAP-based detection of various H. pylori strains by the antibody X, it is applicable to use the antibody X in indirect immunofluorescence testing (IIFT) to detect the presence of H. pylori in serum or other test samples. The antibody X can also be used in immunohistochemistry (IHC) or other immunoassays for detecting H. pylori.",
                                "In conclusion, the antibody X of the present invention can detect HP-NAP, and it can bind to the amino acid residues Arg77 to Glu116 of HP-NAP. Specifically, the antibody X recognizes the epitope of D98Y99K100XXE103 (SEQ ID NO:2) on HP-NAP, and thus it can be used to detects HP-NAP from various H. pylori strains. Furthermore, the antibody X can inhibit HP-NAP-induced ROS production by neutrophils and serve as a blocking antibody to HP-NAP. Therefore, the antibody X can be applied in diagnosing H. pylori infection and treating the infection via inhibiting the inflammatory responses ignited by H. pylori.",
