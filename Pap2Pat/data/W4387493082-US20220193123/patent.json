                        "Prostate and breast cancer are some of the most common cancers among individuals in the United States. Although the incidence of prostate cancer is markedly age dependent and about two-fold higher in African-Americans than Caucasians, prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among men of all races. Conventional chemotherapeutic approaches yield median overall survival rates for stage IV prostate of only twenty-nine percent (29%) and stage IV breast cancer of only twenty-three percent (23%). Despite recent advances in the first-line treatment of both cancer types, many patients eventually relapse; their tumors become chemo resistant; leading to patient mortality. One of the problems in cancer chemotherapy is the deleterious side effects of anticancer drugs designed to destroy rapidly dividing cells, including cells found in healthy tissues. Due to these severe side effects, doctors often resort to dose reduction, treatment delay or discontinuance of therapy.",
                        "Cisplatin and carboplatin are two known chemotherapeutic drugs in the platinum (Pt) family of anticancer drugs. They are the most potent drugs in the Pt family and are commonly given in late state or stage IV cancer types as they effectively disrupt cell cycle/cellular division and can cause cancer cells cytotoxicity/apoptosis leading to tumor death or reduction in size. Cisplatin inhibits growth of tumor cells by interference with normal transcription and DNA replication mechanisms leading to eventual cell death. Cisplatin chemotherapy, however, is not currently very effective in prostate cancer treatment due to its poor targeting of tumor cells and the development of chemo resistant tumors. Carboplatin, an analog of cisplatin, has gained greater use because of its decreased nonspecific toxicity and its activity against cisplatin-resistant tumors. See I. Hamelers, et al., \u201cCarboplatin nanocapsules: a highly cytotoxic, phospholipid-based formulation of carboplatin,\u201d Molecular Cancer Therapeutics 2006, 5 (8), (2007-12).",
                        "Due to their lack of selectivity towards cancer cells the high doses administered to a patient to reach a therapeutic response for both carboplatin and cisplatin cause severe side effects including: nausea, vomiting, taste changes, hair loss, weakness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, mouth sore, infection, peripheral neuropathy, central neurotoxicity hearing loss, abnormal blood electrolyte levels, abnormal liver enzyme levels, cardiovascular events, dizziness, fatigue, etc. See L. X. Cubeddu, et al., \u201cEfficacy of ondansetron (GR 38032F) and the role of serotonin in cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting,\u201d The New England Journal Of Medicine, 322 (12), pp. 810-6 (1990). Additionally, certain cancers can develop resistance to cisplatin via efflux pumps. See K. Katano, et al., \u201cAcquisition of resistance to cisplatin is accompanied by changes in the cellular pharmacology of copper,\u201d Cancer Research, 62 (22), pp. 6559-65 (2002). Despite the current lack of effective chemotherapies utilizing cisplatin, the drug remains attractive for development in cancer treatments due to its potency. Accordingly, the development of treatment methods and chemotherapies that will better direct cisplatin to its desired target, tumor cells, with fewer side effects and improved efficacy is needed.",
                        "Various studies have found that receptors for certain peptides/hormones are found in higher concentration in tumor cells than in normal cells. For example, the receptor for luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) is overexpressed in numerous types of cancer cells including but not limited to reproductive cancers including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. See A. Taheri, \u201cThe in-vivo antitumor,\u201d International Journal of Pharmaceutics, (2012). Various non-reproductive cancers have been shown to overexpress the LHRH receptor as well, including but not limited to: lung, bladder, and pancreatic cancers, among others. LHRH, also referred to as gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), is a decapeptide regulatory hormone comprised of SEQ ID NO 1 pG1u-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2 involved in reproduction. Studies have shown that LHRH receptors are overexpressed in breast, prostate, endometrial and ovarian cancers, along with non-reproductive cancers, in comparison to normal cells, making the LHRH peptide a good candidate for drug targeting. See A. Qayum, et al., \u201cThe effects of gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues in prostate cancer are mediated through specific tumour receptors,\u201d See British Journal Of Cancer, 62 (1), pp. 96-9 (1990); M.

Emons, et al., \u201cThe use of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists and antagonists in gynecological cancers,\u201d Hum Reprod, 9 (7), pp. 1364-79, (1994).",
                        "Additionally, LHRH has been shown to be effective as a stand-alone treatment in certain cancer cases. Specific analogs of LHRH peptide for use in targeting LHRH receptors in prostate and breast cancers are also known in the art. See A. V. Schally, et al., \u201cPeptide analogs in the therapy of prostate cancer,\u201d Prostate, 45, pp. 158-66 (2000); W. R.

                        "Existing methods for using hormones (such as LHRH and its analogs), peptides, antibodies and ligands to specifically target and direct anticancer drugs and compounds to cancer cells via receptor binding sites on those cells continue to be explored in field of biomedical pharmacology with limited success. See Aggarwal, et al., \u201c[DLys(6)]-luteinizing hormone releasing hormone-curcumin conjugate inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo\u201d International Journal of Cancer 2011, 129 (7), 1611-23; M.

                        "The delivery of cisplatin by LHRH has been explored by the use of nanogels. However, the direct linkage of LHRH to cisplatin as a method of delivery has not been developed. The use of nanogels employs a more complex methodology involving cisplatin incorporation and release from the nanogel. Rendering it a less effective mode of delivery. See N.

                        "Therefore, there is a need for Platinum (Pt)-LHRH conjugates for treating reproductive cancers that allows for the effective delivery of cytotoxic drugs in the platinum family to tumor cells. Such a needed Platinum (Pt)-LHRH conjugates would decrease adverse side effects associated with existing drugs, and limit nonspecific activity."

In a preferred embodiment, LHRH is conjugated to activated cisplatin using a malonate (mal) linker on [DLys6]-LHRH. The attachment of the mal linker on position 6 of the LHRH ensures that the intrinsic properties of the LHRH peptide are maintained. In the preferred embodiment, an ester bond is introduced between the components of the conjugate. Existing published reports have shown that such a bond is hydrolyzed by cellular esterase, leaving the drug free to act at the cellular level. See Aggarwal, et al., \u201c[DLys(6)]-luteinizing hormone releasing hormone-curcumin conjugate inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo\u201d International Journal of Cancer 2011, 129 (7), 1611-23; U.

The addition of a PEG group to a linker is known to provide synthetic compound solubility or enhance bioavailability. In the preferred embodiment, the Pt-LHRH conjugate does not require a PEGylated linker to be soluble and effective. Alternatively, in a further embodiment, the Pt-LHRH conjugate may incorporate a PEGylated linker to enhance solubility (see FIG. 14). PEGylation has been employed during nanoparticle and NGR-Pt formulation. See M. Ndinguri, et al., \u201cPeptide targeting of platinum anti-cancer drugs,\u201d Bioconjugate Chem., 20, pp. 1869-78 (2009); N.

Further, the Pt-LHRH is highly soluble and has not been shown to precipitate out of solution even after four months of storage in a 10 mM solution at 4\u00b0 C. This could aid in therapeutic administration of the compound.",
                        "The present invention describes the use of Boc protecting group instead of Fmoc in the last amino acid (Boc-Glu(OtBu) (see. FIG. 2). This allows for a straight forward synthesis because it reduces the number of synthetic steps and avoids unwanted side chain reactions that can occur at the glutamic acid position. The acid labile Boc protecting group is conveniently removed at the end during cleavage of the peptide from the resin. The activated cisplatin is used to bind to the mal-LHRH moiety. The malonate linker chelates platinum in a similar manner to carboplatin, even with variations in linker length, as shown in FIG. 13. As shown in FIG. 13, additional carbons may be added to the malonate linker without altering the desired functionality or effect of Pt-LHRH. The end compound (see FIG. 2) chemically resembles carboplatin. Hence, carboplatin is utilized for treatment comparison. The Pt-LHRH has more effective systemic distribution and bioavailability to carboplatin. In addition, the cellular internalized into the cancer cell following its Pt-LHRH is cleaved by proteases which produces a platinum complex that resembles cisplatin in structure and function.",

                                "FIG. 2 depicts a synthesis of Pt-LHRH conjugate in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The Mal-LHRH decapeptide was synthesized using Fmoc solid phase chemistry techniques and then chelated to activated cisplatin. Fmoc-Rink Amide-AM resin was placed onto a reaction vessel and washed with DMF and DCM in continuous-flow mode using a PS3 peptide synthesizer. The side chain protected amino acids derivatives used were Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)\u2014OH, Fmoc-Leu-OH, Fmoc-DLys(Aloc)\u2014OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)\u2014OH, Fmoc-Ser(tBu)\u2014OH, Fmoc-Trp(Boc)\u2014OH, Fmoc-His(Trt)\u2014OH and Boc-Glu(OtBu)\u2014OH. Moreover, the use of Boc protecting group instead of Fmoc in the last amino acid (Boc-Glu(OtBu) allows for a straightforward synthesis because it reduces the number of synthetic steps and avoids unwanted side chain reactions. The acid labile Boc protecting group is conveniently removed in the end during cleavage of the peptide from the resin. The amino acid couplings employed four equivalents of amino acid and (2-(6-Chloro-1 H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1, 1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU) and sometimes (7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yloxy) tripyrrolidinophosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyAOP) or other known coupling reagents dissolved in 0.4 M N-methylmorpholine (NMM) in DMF at room temperature. The allyloxycarbonyl (aloc) protecting group on the D-lys was selectively removed using palladium. The amine end of the D-lys was coupled with the mal linker (see FIG. 2) and the conjugate cleaved from the resin using TFA-Tips-H2O-Phenol or TFA-Tips-H2O or TFA-Thioanisole-H2O or TFA-Thioanisole-H2O cocktail to yield of LHRH-mal. Activated cisplatin was formed using cisplatin, silver nitrate and water in accordance with known methods as described in Berners-Price, et al., \u201cHydrolysis products of cisplatin: pKa determinations via [1H, 15N] NMR spectroscopy,\u201d Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications (1992) 789-791; Appleton et al., \u201cNMR study of acid-base equilibria and other reactions of ammineplatinum complexes with aqua and hydroxo ligands,\u201d Inorganic Chemistry, (1989) 28, 1989-1993. Reaction of LHRH-mal and activated cisplatin yielded Pt-LHRH. Conjugation of Pt to LHRH yields a structure similar to carboplatin no matter the malonate linker carbon chain length (see FIG. 13) nor the PEGylation state (see FIG. 14).",

After tumor initiation (\u02dc100 mm3) the mice were administered Pt-LHRH (carboplatin molar-equivalent dosage) through IP injection and compared to those treated with carboplatin (5 mg/kg/wk), no treatment, and LHRH plus carboplatin (unbound) controls for 2 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored daily and tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: (width) 2\u00d7length/2, where width is the smaller of the two measurements.
