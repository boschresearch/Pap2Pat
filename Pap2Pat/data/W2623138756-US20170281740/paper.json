    "title": "Analysis of complete genome sequence and major surface antigens of<i>Neorickettsia helminthoeca</i>, causative agent of salmon poisoning disease",
    "date": "2017-06-06",
    "abstract": "Neorickettsia helminthoeca, a type species of the genus Neorickettsia, is an endosymbiont of digenetic trematodes of veterinary importance. Upon ingestion of salmonid fish parasitized with infected trematodes, canids develop salmon poisoning disease (SPD), an acute febrile illness that is particularly severe and often fatal in dogs without adequate treatment. We determined and analysed the complete genome sequence of N. helminthoeca: a single small circular chromosome of 884 232 bp encoding 774 potential proteins. N. helminthoeca is unable to synthesize lipopolysaccharides and most amino acids, but is capable of synthesizing vitamins, cofactors, nucleotides and bacterioferritin. N. helminthoeca is, however, distinct from majority of the family Anaplasmataceae to which it belongs, as it encodes nearly all enzymes required for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, suggesting its structural hardiness and inflammatory potential. Using sera from dogs that were experimentally infected by feeding with parasitized fish or naturally infected in southern California, Western blot analysis revealed that among five predicted N. helminthoeca outer membrane proteins, P51 and strain-variable surface antigen were uniformly recognized. Our finding will help understanding pathogenesis, prevalence of N. helminthoeca infection among trematodes, canids and potentially other animals in nature to develop effective SPD diagnostic and preventive measures. Recent progresses in large-scale genome sequencing have been uncovering broad distribution of Neorickettsia spp., the comparative genomics will facilitate understanding of biology and the natural history of these elusive environmental bacteria.",

                "Salmon poisoning disease (SPD), an acute and often\u2010fatal illness in wild and domestic canids, was first discovered in the 1800s when early settlers in Pacific Northwest noted their dogs becoming ill following ingestion of salmon (Philip, 1955). In 1950, a bacterial pathogen was implicated as the causative agent of SPD and named Neorickettsia helminthoeca, due to its biological similarity to the members of the family Rickettsiaceae and the novel invertebrate/helminth vector (Cordy and Gorham, 1950; Philip, 1955). N.\u00a0helminthoeca exists in all life stages of the fluke Nanophyetus salmincola (Bennington and Pratt, 1960; Schlegel et\u00a0al., 1968), which has a complicated digenetic life cycle involving both pleurocid freshwater snails (Oxytrema silicula) and salmonid fish as intermediate hosts (Millemann and Knapp, 1970; Headley et\u00a0al., 2011). Due to the limited geographic range of the vector and intermediate hosts, the distribution of SPD was thought to be limited to the northern Pacific coast. However, SPD cases have been confirmed in southern California (this study; Veterinary Practice News, 2009), Vancouver Island, Canada (Booth et\u00a0al., 1984), and Maringa, Brazil, using immunohistochemical, histopathological and molecular diagnostic techniques (Table\u00a01; Headley et\u00a0al., 2004, 2006, 2011), although the vector and life cycle in these regions remain to be identified. The expansion of the geographic distribution of SPD where N.\u00a0salmincola has not been documented suggests the potential adaptation of this organism to other trematode vectors.",
                "While there is a large range of definitive hosts for the trematode, N.\u00a0helminthoeca causes severe SPD in members of the Canidae family including dogs, foxes and coyotes (Cordy and Gorham, 1950; Philip et\u00a0al., 1954a,b; Philip, 1955; Foreyt et\u00a0al., 1987). Dogs most commonly acquire SPD when they eat raw or undercooked salmonid fish containing encysted trematodes infected with N.\u00a0helminthoeca. Upon ingestion, the metacercariae stage of the trematode matures in the intestinal lumen for 5\u20138\u00a0days and releases the bacteria to be picked up by monocytes and macrophages in the intestinal wall. The exact mechanism of bacterial entry into these cells is not known, but morphological studies demonstrate the organism existing as clusters termed morulae or singly within a host cell\u2010derived membrane vacuole in the cytoplasm of the canine host cell (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991). N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010infected cells travel throughout the circulation and accumulate in the thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes with the mesenteric and ileocecal lymph nodes being most commonly affected (Philip et\u00a0al., 1954a; Philip, 1955; Headley et\u00a0al., 2011). Symptoms begin with pyrexia (39.8\u201340.9\u00b0C) that persists for 6\u20137\u00a0days and anorexia (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991). Dogs progress to vomiting and diarrhoea that may or may not contain blood 4\u20136\u00a0days following development of a fever. Other symptoms include ocular discharge, weight loss, lethargy and dehydration. If left untreated, death occurs 2\u201310\u00a0days after development of symptoms (Philip, 1955). Current therapies for SPD include fluid therapy, blood transfusions for haemorrhagic diarrhoea, anti\u2010helminthic praziquantel and oral doxycycline or intravenous oxytetracycline. Affected individuals produce specific immunity to SPD following recovery from the disease (Philip et\u00a0al., 1954a; Philip, 1955).",
                "Neorickettsia species are obligatory intracellular \u03b1\u2010proteobacteria that belong to the family Anaplasmataceae in the order Rickettsiales (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2005). Neorickettsia spp. are the deepest branching lineage in the family Anaplasmataceae, whereas Anaplasma and Ehrlichia are sister genera that share a common ancestor with Wolbachia spp. (Fig.\u00a01; Pretzman et\u00a0al., 1995; Wen et\u00a0al., 1995, 1996). The branching pattern suggests that the speciation of N.\u00a0helminthoeca occurred earlier than the speciation of N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu. These findings and many other molecular phylogenetic analyses (Anderson et\u00a0al., 1992; Wen et\u00a0al., 1995, 1996; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1997) led to the drastic reclassification of the family Anaplasmataceae (Dumler et\u00a0al., 2001).",
                "Currently, only three pathogenic species of Neorickettsia, namely N.\u00a0helminthoeca (type species), N.\u00a0sennetsu (agent of human Sennetsu fever) and N.\u00a0risticii (agent of Potomac horse fever) have been culture isolated and characterized in sufficient details with documented biological and medical significance (Table\u00a01; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991, 2005). All of them are known to transmit from trematodes to monocytes/macrophages of mammals (dogs, humans and horses, respectively) and cause severe, sometimes fatal illnesses (Table\u00a01; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2005). In addition, the Stellantochasmus falcatus (SF) agent, which is closely related to N.\u00a0risticii, was culture isolated from S.\u00a0falcatus fluke encysting the grey mullet fish in Japan (Wen et\u00a0al., 1996) and from fish in Oregon (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2004). The initial 16S rRNA gene sequence\u2010based phylogenetic analysis of N.\u00a0helminthoeca revealed that the divergence of 16S rRNA sequences is around 5% between N.\u00a0helminthoeca and N.\u00a0risticii or N.\u00a0sennetsu, whereas it is only 0.7% between N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu.",
                "As endosymbionts of digenetic trematodes (parasitic flatworms or flukes), Neorickettsia species are abundant in nature and have been identified throughout the life cycle of the trematodes and the hosts of trematodes including the essential first intermediate host of snails, the second intermediate hosts such as fish and aquatic insects and the definitive hosts such as mammals and birds wherein the trematodes sexually reproduce fertilized eggs (Cordy and Gorham, 1950; Philip et\u00a0al., 1954a,b; Philip, 1955; Foreyt et\u00a0al., 1987; Gibson et\u00a0al., 2005; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2005; Gibson and Rikihisa, 2008; Greiman et\u00a0al., 2016). Recent reports revealed more than 10 new genotypes of Neorickettsia in divergent digenean families throughout the world, including Asia, Africa, Australia, Americas and even Antarctica (Ward et\u00a0al., 2009; Tkach et\u00a0al., 2012; Greiman et\u00a0al., 2014, 2017), suggesting a global distribution of Neorickettsia spp. Notably, a Neorickettsia sp. was found in the medically important trematode Fasciola hepatica (the liver fluke, fasciolosis disease agent) isolated from a sheep in Oregon US (McNulty et\u00a0al., 2017). In addition, a related new species named Candidatus \u2018Xenolissoclinum pacificiensis L6\u2019 was identified in the ascidian tunicate Lissoclinum patella, a marine chordate animal at the coast of Papua New Guinea (Kwan and Schmidt, 2013), implicating even boarder distribution of Neorickettsia\u2010like bacteria among diverse invertebrates. To date, the complete genome sequences have been determined only for N.\u00a0sennetsu (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006) and N.\u00a0risticii (Lin et\u00a0al., 2009), and almost complete genome sequences were obtained for Neorickettsia endobacterium of F.\u00a0hepatica (NFh) and Candidatus \u2018X. pacificiensis\u2019 (Kwan and Schmidt, 2013; McNulty et\u00a0al., 2017). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggests that NFh shares >\u00a099% identity with N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu, while Candidatus \u2018X. pacificiensis\u2019 is distantly related to Neorickettsia spp. (Fig.\u00a01). Genomic comparisons indicated that approximately 97% of the predicted proteins (721 of 744) of NFh showed top matches to N.\u00a0risticii or N.\u00a0sennetsu, while 22 unique proteins of NFh were hypothetical proteins without functional annotations (McNulty et\u00a0al., 2017).",
                "Because the mortality rate of SPD is >\u00a090% without rapid antibiotic treatment (Philip, 1955; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991), the current inefficient diagnostic method (faecal examination for parasite eggs and/or Romanowsky staining of lymph node aspirates), and the expansion of the geographic distribution of SPD, there remains a need for better understanding of N.\u00a0helminthoeca and development of a simple and rapid serodiagnostic approach. In this study, we sought to (i) determine the complete genome of N.\u00a0helminthoeca and compare with closely related N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu genomes, (ii) determine, clone and purify putative immunodominant major outer membrane proteins (OMPs), and (iii) test immunoreactivity of these recombinant OMPs using sera from dogs that were experimentally or naturally infected with N.\u00a0helminthoeca."

                        "The genome of N.\u00a0helminthoeca Oregon consists of a single double\u2010stranded circular chromosome spanning 884\u00a0232\u00a0bp, which is similar to those of N.\u00a0risticii (Lin et\u00a0al., 2009) and N.\u00a0sennetsu (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006; Table\u00a02), and smaller than those of other members in the family Anaplasmataceae (approximately 1.0\u20131.5 Mbp; Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006). G+C content of N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome is 41.7% (Table\u00a02), which is similar to those of other Neorickettsia and Anaplasma spp., but greater than those (approximately 30%) of Ehrlichia spp. and Wolbachia spp. (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006). The replication origin of N.\u00a0helminthoeca (Fig.\u00a02) was predicted based on one of the GC\u2010skew shift points, and the region between hemE (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, NHE_RS00005) and an uncharacterized phage protein (NHE_RS04160) as described in N.\u00a0risticii (Lin et\u00a0al., 2009), N.\u00a0sennetsu (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006) and other members in the family Anaplasmataceae (Ioannidis et\u00a0al., 2007).",
                        "The N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome encodes one copy each of the 5S, 16S and 23S rRNA genes, which are separated in two loci with the 5S and 23S rRNA genes forming an operon (Fig.\u00a02, red bars in third circle from outside) as in other sequenced members in the family Anaplasmataceae (Massung et\u00a0al., 2002; Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006). Thirty\u2010three tRNA genes are identified, which include cognates for all 20 amino acids (Table\u00a02). The numbers of tRNA genes are identical to other Neorickettsia spp., and similar to other members in the family Anaplasmataceae (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009), or other bacteria with a single rrn operon (Lee et\u00a0al., 2009).",

Among the 774 predicted protein\u2010coding open reading frames (ORFs), 548 genes are assigned with probable functions based on sequence similarity searches. Approximately 29% of the predicted ORFs (226 genes) in the genome are annotated as hypothetical proteins, either with conserved domains or of unknown functions (Table\u00a03)."

                        "Previous studies have shown that Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. have a single large\u2010scale symmetrical inversion (X\u2010alignment) near the replication origin, which is possibly mediated by duplicated rho genes (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006; Frutos et\u00a0al., 2007; Nene and Kole, 2009). In addition, Anaplasma and Wolbachia spp. have extensive genomic rearrangement throughout the genome (Wu et\u00a0al., 2004; Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006). However, the synteny is highly conserved and such genomic rearrangements or a large\u2010scale inversion is not detected among N.\u00a0helminthoeca, N.\u00a0sennetsu and N.\u00a0risticii (Fig.\u00a0S1), and rho is not duplicated in three sequenced Neorickettsia spp. In agreement with the 16S rRNA divergence (Fig.\u00a01), N.\u00a0helminthoeca exhibits multiple synteny divergences from N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu (Fig.\u00a0S1).",
                        "To compare the genomic contents among Neorickettsia spp., two\u2010 and three\u2010way comparisons were performed using reciprocal blastp algorithm with E\u2010value <\u00a01e\u221210, and homologous protein clusters were constructed. Three\u2010way comparison among Neorickettsia spp. showed that >\u00a086% (668 of total 774 protein\u2010coding ORFs) of N.\u00a0helminthoeca proteins are conserved with N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu (Table\u00a03 and Table\u00a0S1). The vast majority (>\u00a078%, 525/668 ORFs) of these conserved proteins are associated with housekeeping functions and likely essential for Neorickettsia survival (Table\u00a03). Two\u2010way comparisons revealed that N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu share an additional 55 conserved proteins, whereas N.\u00a0helminthoeca shares very limited numbers of orthologues (<\u00a010 proteins) with N.\u00a0risticii or N.\u00a0sennetsu (Fig.\u00a03). The result of the two\u2010way and three\u2010way comparisons is consistent with the relationship of the species revealed through 16S rRNA\u2010based phylogeny and whole\u2010genome synteny analysis.",
                        "The three Neorickettsia spp. are transmitted by distinct trematodes and cause severe diseases at high mortality in different mammalian hosts (Table\u00a01; Cordes et\u00a0al., 1986; Dutta et\u00a0al., 1988; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991, 2004, 2005; Gibson and Rikihisa, 2008; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009). We, therefore, analysed the species\u2010specific genes based on the two\u2010 and three\u2010way comparisons. There are 89 species\u2010specific proteins in N.\u00a0helminthoeca as compared to 28 and 23 in N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu respectively (Tables S2\u2013S4). Of the genes unique to N.\u00a0helminthoeca, more than half of them (50/89 ORFs) are hypothetical proteins without assigned functions (Table\u00a0S2). Among the N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010specific proteins with assigned functions, ~38% (15/39 ORFs) are involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis that are absent in N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu (Table\u00a0S2 and Fig.\u00a05), and six proteins are categorized as transporters for iron and other substrates (Table\u00a0S2). The genomic loci encoding these unique ORFs are distributed throughout N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome and not clustered in certain islands (Fig.\u00a02, second circle from outside). Blast searches using these N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010specific proteins against NCBI protein database excluding Neorickettsia spp. showed that only 29 of them match to proteins in other genera, and the majority of them (19, 65.5%) belong to \u03b1\u2010proteobacteria (Table\u00a0S2). However, whether these proteins are the results of horizontal gene transfer or mutations/deletions from the ancestors of Neorickettsia spp. remains to be determined."

It is likely that N.\u00a0helminthoeca can synthesize ATP from glutamine as N.\u00a0risticii, N.\u00a0sennetsu, or E.\u00a0chaffeensis does (Weiss et\u00a0al., 1989; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2014), as it encodes carbamoyl phosphate synthase (carA/B, NHE_RS00875/NHE_RS02090) and bifunctional glutamate synthase \u03b2 subunit/2\u2010polyprenylphenol hydroxylase (GS/PH, NHE_RS02780). These enzymes can convert glutamine to ammonia and glutamate (Fig.\u00a04), and glutamate can be further converted by glutamate dehydrogenase (NHE_RS02165) to 2\u2010ketoglutarate, which enters the TCA cycle for energy production."

As they are converted from other amino acids or metabolic intermediates, N.\u00a0helminthoeca must transport most amino acids from its host as discussed further below (Table\u00a0S7). However, as other members of the family Anaplasmataceae, analysis of KEGG pathways showed that most enzymes are identified for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and certain phospholipids, including phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine and myo\u2010inositol\u2010phosphates (Fig.\u00a04).",
                                "Similar to all other sequenced members of Anaplasmataceae (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006), N.\u00a0helminthoeca encodes a non\u2010oxidative pentose\u2010phosphate pathway that utilizes glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate to produce pentose for nucleotide and cofactor biosynthesis. Accordingly, N.\u00a0helminthoeca encodes complete pathways for de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and is capable of synthesizing most vitamins or cofactors, such as biotin, folate, FAD, NAD and protoheme (Fig.\u00a04 and Table\u00a0S6). Overall, N.\u00a0helminthoeca encodes large number of genes involved in the biosynthesis of cofactors, vitamins and nucleotides (17.2%, 133 of total 774 protein\u2010coding ORFs), similar to other members of Anaplasmataceae like Ehrlichia (13.4%, 149/1115 ORFs in E.\u00a0chaffeensis), Anaplasma (10.6%, 145/1370 ORFs in A.\u00a0phagocytophilum; Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006) and Wolbachia endosymbionts of the insects or nematodes (9.4%, 120/1271 in Wolbachia pipientis wMel; Foster et\u00a0al., 2005; Brownlie et\u00a0al., 2009).

The presence of these biosynthesis pathways suggests that N.\u00a0helminthoeca do not need to compete with the host for the essential vitamins and nucleotides, which is likely beneficial for their survival especially in invertebrate hosts."

Transporters for acetyl\u2010CoA involved in many metabolic pathways and glycerol\u20103\u2010phosphate in phospholipid biosynthesis are identified in N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome (Table\u00a0S7). Transport systems for phosphates (pstA/B/C/S), cations, anions, organic ions and multidrug resistance pumps are also present (Table\u00a0S7). Putative amino acid transporters for alanine, glycine, proline and dicarboxylate amino acids (glutamate or aspartate family) can be found (Table\u00a0S7). However, as very few amino acids can be synthesized in N.\u00a0helminthoeca, more transporters are required; it is possible that some ATP\u2010binding cassette (ABC)\u2010type transporters with no assigned functions or porins discussed below could act as transporters for amino acids as well as metabolites for protein synthesis and energy production. Orthologues of most identified transporters are conserved in N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu genomes (Tables S1 and S7), except for few N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010specific transporters listed in Table\u00a0S2. Unlike Rickettsia spp. (Winkler, 1976), but similar to all other sequenced members of the Family Anaplasmataceae, N.\u00a0helminthoeca does not encode translocases for ATP (ATP:ADP antiporters) or NADH, so it likely relies on its own ATP production or encodes unique ATP acquisition mechanisms.",

Similar to other members of the Anaplasmataceae that have limited capabilities of amino acids biosynthesis, intermediary metabolism and glycolysis, nutrient uptake in these bacteria necessitates pores or channels in the bacterial outer membrane (Huang et\u00a0al., 2007; Kumagai et\u00a0al., 2008; Gibson et\u00a0al., 2010). Previous studies have determined that the major outer membrane proteins, including A.\u00a0phagocytophilum P44s (Huang et\u00a0al., 2007), E.\u00a0chaffeensis P28/OMP\u20101F (Kumagai et\u00a0al., 2008) and N.\u00a0sennetsu P51 (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2010), possess porin activities as determined by a proteoliposome swelling assay, which allow the diffusion of l\u2010glutamine, the monosaccharides arabinose and glucose, the disaccharide sucrose and even the tetrasaccharide stachyose. N. helminthoeca encodes a P51 protein (NHE_RS00965) that shares 60% amino acid sequence similarity with N.\u00a0sennetsu P51 protein (Fig.\u00a06A). Prediction of the two\u2010dimensional structure of N.\u00a0helminthoeca P51 using PRED\u2010TMBB (http://biophysics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-TMBB/; Bagos et\u00a0al., 2004) showed that P51 protein contains 18 transmembrane domains with a discrimination value of 2.949 (Fig.\u00a0S2), suggesting that it is a \u03b2\u2010barrel protein localized to the outer membrane similar to N.\u00a0sennetsu P51 (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2010).

All major components for the Sec\u2010dependent pathway are identified, including signal recognition particle (SRP) protein, SRP\u2010docking protein FtsY, the cytosolic protein\u2010export chaperone SecB, peripheral associated ATP\u2010dependent motor protein SecA, membrane\u2010embedded protein conducting channel SecYEG, periplasmic protein YajC that involved in preprotein translocase activity and the membrane complex SecDF that enhances proton motive force (Fig.\u00a04 and summarized under role category \u2018Protein fate\u2019 in Table\u00a0S1).

                                "Extracellular secretion of various virulence factors across the bacterial cell envelope is one of the major mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria alter host cell functions, thus enhancing survival of the bacteria and damaging hosts. At least six distinct extracellular protein secretion systems, referred to as type I\u2010VI secretion systems (T1SS\u2010T6SS; Papanikou et\u00a0al., 2007; Costa et\u00a0al., 2015), have been classified in Gram\u2010negative bacteria that secrete effector molecules across two lipid bilayers and the periplasm. Except for T2SS, all double\u2010membrane\u2010spanning secretion systems (T1SS, T3SS, T4SS and T6SS) use a one\u2010step mechanism to transport substrates directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the extracellular space or into a target cell (Costa et\u00a0al., 2015). Bioinfomatic analysis shows that, similar to all other sequenced members of the family Anaplasmataceae, N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome encodes both T1SS and T4SS for secretion of proteins across the membranes, but it lacks homologs of T2SS, T3SS, T5SS or T6SS components (Fig.\u00a04; Henderson et\u00a0al., 2004; Cianciotto, 2005; Bingle et\u00a0al., 2008). T1SS, a Sec\u2010independent ATP\u2010driven ABC transporter system that bypasses the periplasm, is capable of transporting target proteins carrying a C\u2010terminal uncleaved secretion signal across both inner and outer membranes and into the extracellular medium (Delepelaire, 2004). All of the three components of T1SS, including an inner membrane ATP\u2010binding cassette (ABC) transporter HlyB (NHE_RS00175), a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) HlyD (NHE_RS04020) and an outer membrane channel protein TolC (NHE_RS03400) are identified in the N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome (Fig.\u00a04, Table\u00a0S1 and S6). A previous study reported that several tandem repeat proteins (TRP120, TRP47 and TRP32/VLPT) are T1SS substrates of E.\u00a0chaffeensis using an E.\u00a0coli T1SS surrogate system (Wakeel et\u00a0al., 2011). Current analysis using the T\u2010REKS algorism (Jorda and Kajava, 2009) identified several tandem repeat\u2010containing proteins (not homologous to E.\u00a0chaffeensis TRPs) like VirB6 and SSAs in all three sequenced Neorickettsia; however, whether these proteins are also secreted by T1SS is unknown (Table\u00a0S9; Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009).",
                                "T4SS can translocate bacterial effector molecules into host cells, thus often plays a key role in pathogenesis of Gram\u2010negative host\u2010associated bacteria (Cascales and Christie, 2003; Backert and Meyer, 2006; Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2010; Christie et\u00a0al., 2014). In several intracellular bacteria including the family Anaplasmataceae such as E.\u00a0chaffeensis and A.\u00a0phagocytophilum, the T4SS is critical for survival and replication inside host cells, by inducing autophagy for nutrient acquisition and inhibition of host cell apoptosis (Niu et\u00a0al., 2006; Niu et\u00a0al., 2010; Liu et\u00a0al., 2012; Niu et\u00a0al., 2012; Lin et\u00a0al., 2007; Lin et\u00a0al., 2016). In the N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome, we identified a T4SS encoded by virB/D genes distributed in four separate loci. The organization of virB/D gene clusters is conserved among Neorickettsia spp. as with other Anaplasmataceae, with duplicated genes of virB4, virB8 and virB9, and multiple copies of virB2 and virB6 genes (Tables S1 and S6).",
                                "Subcellular fractionation and functional studies have demonstrated that VirB2 is the major pilus component of T4SS extracellular filaments (Cascales and Christie, 2003; Backert and Meyer, 2006). Our previous study has confirmed that N.\u00a0risticii VirB2 was localized at the opposite poles on the bacterial surface (Lin et\u00a0al., 2009), suggesting that VirB2 might serve as secretion channels for the T4SS apparatus like that of Agrobacterium (Cascales and Christie, 2003), and play critical roles in mediating the interaction with host cells. Analysis of N. helminthoeca genome reveals three copies of virB2 upstream of virB4, whereas N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu encode two virB2 genes (Table\u00a0S6; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009). Alignment of VirB2 protein sequences indicates that VirB2s of Neorickettsia spp. are closely related to those of other \u03b1\u2010proteobacteria like Rickettsia, Agrobacterium and Caulobacter, but are phylogenetically distinct from VirB2s of E.\u00a0chaffeensis and A.\u00a0phagocytophilum that form a separate clade (Fig.\u00a0S3; Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2009, 2010). The different numbers of virB2 genes and distinct differences in phylogenetic trees of VirB2 from 16S rRNA gene suggest that virB2 genes might undergo lineage\u2010specific mutations, duplications, or deletions (Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2010)."

TCRS consists of a sensor histidine protein kinase that responds to specific signals, and a cognate response regulator. Phosphorylation of a response regulator by a cognate histidine kinase changes the biochemical properties of its output domain, which can participate in DNA binding and transcriptional control, perform enzymatic activities, bind RNA, or engage in protein\u2013protein interactions (Gao et\u00a0al., 2007). TCRS plays a key role in controlling virulence responses in a wide variety of bacterial pathogens (Dorman et\u00a0al., 2001; Mitrophanov and Groisman, 2008), including E.\u00a0chaffeensis and A.\u00a0phagocytophilum in the family Anaplasmataceae, which encode three pairs of TCRS, including CckA/CtrA, PleC/PleD and NtrX/NtrY (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2006; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2011; Kumagai et\u00a0al., 2006; Kumagai et\u00a0al., 2011).",

The histidine kinase CckA/response regulator CtrA pair, identified only in \u03b1\u2010proteobacteria, also have been demonstrated to coordinate multiple cell cycle events at the transcriptional level in E.\u00a0chaffeensis to regulate bacterial developmental cycle (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2011). Different from Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, the three Neorickettsia spp. encode two copies of PleC histidine kinase (NHE_RS00035/NHE_RS02255, Tables S1 and S6) and a one\u2010component signal transduction protein, an EAL domain protein (NHE_RS01830; Fig.\u00a0S4; Ulrich and Zhulin, 2007; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009; Romling, 2009; Ulrich and Zhulin, 2010; Lai et\u00a0al., 2009). The response regulator PleD (NHE_RS02155) can function as diguanyl cyclase that produces cyclic diguanylate (c\u2010di\u2010GMP) to regulate cell surface adhesiveness like biofilm or extracellular matrix formation (Tischler and Camilli, 2004), whereas EAL domain protein can function as a diguanylate phosphodiesterase (PDE) that converts c\u2010di\u2010GMP to GMP. They likely function synergistically to regulate surface adhesiveness of Neorickettsia, resulting much smaller morulae sizes and more dispersed bacterial colonies compared to Ehrlichia and Anaplasma (Rikihisa, 1991a). In addition, Neorickettsia spp. do not encode genes for NtrY/NtrX, which are thought to be involved in nitrogen metabolism and regulation of nitrogen fixation genes like glnA that encodes a glutamine synthase as in E.\u00a0chaffeensis (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2014). Despite this, N.\u00a0helminthoeca encodes GlnA (NHE_RS01490) and ABC dicarboxylate amino acid transporters (NHE_RS00770) that are predicted to take up glutamine (Table\u00a0S7) similar to E.\u00a0chaffeensis (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2014), suggesting regulation of nitrogen metabolism in Neorickettsia spp. is different from Ehrlichia and Anaplasma spp."

Compared to free\u2010living bacteria, Ank proteins are enriched in facultative and obligate intracellular bacteria of eukaryotes (Jernigan and Bordenstein, 2014). Several studies have shown that the ankyrin repeat\u2010containing protein AnkA of A.\u00a0phagocytophilum is secreted into host cells by the T4SS and plays an important role in facilitating intracellular infection by activating the Abl\u20101 protein tyrosine kinase, interacting with the host tyrosine phosphatase SHP\u20101, or regulation of host cell transcription (IJdo et\u00a0al., 2007; Lin et\u00a0al., 2007; Garcia\u2010Garcia et\u00a0al., 2009). In E.\u00a0chaffeensis, AnkA homologue Ank200 is translocated into the host cell nucleus through a T1SS\u2010dependent manner and binds to Alu elements and numerous host proteins (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2009; Wakeel et\u00a0al., 2011). Four ankyrin repeat\u2010containing proteins were identified in the N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome (four in N.\u00a0risticii and three in N.\u00a0sennetsu; Table\u00a0S6). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that N.\u00a0helminthoeca encodes one Ank protein (NHE_RS00105) that is clustered with E.\u00a0chaffeensis T1SS substrate Ank200 (11.6% amino acid similarities; Wakeel et\u00a0al., 2011) and less related to A.\u00a0phagocytophilum T4SS substrate AnkA (8.6% amino acid similarities; Lin et\u00a0al., 2007; Fig.\u00a0S5). However, whether any of these ankyrin repeat\u2010containing proteins of Neorickettsia spp. can be secreted into host cytoplasm by the T1SS or T4SS and regulate host cell functions remain to be determined."

                                "Iron is an essential element for almost all living organisms and serves as a cofactor in key metabolic processes including energy generation, electron transport and DNA synthesis (Skaar, 2010). This study found that the three Neorickettsia spp., E.\u00a0chaffeensis and A.\u00a0phagocytophilum encode proteins for iron transport across inner membranes, including periplasmic Fe3+\u2010binding protein FbpA (NHE_RS00045), cytoplasmic membrane permease component FbpB (NHE_RS01265) and cytoplasmic ABC transporter FbpC (PotC, NHE_RS01995; Table\u00a0S1). However, homologues to known bacterial siderophore and outer membrane receptors for iron or chelated iron are not identified in these bacteria, suggesting that they might use a unique system to bind and uptake iron from their host. Infection of N.\u00a0risticii, N.\u00a0sennetsu and E.\u00a0chaffeensis, but not A.\u00a0phagocytophilum, are inhibited by an intracellular labile iron chelator deferoxamine (Park and Rikihisa, 1992; Barnewall and Rikihisa, 1994; Barnewall et\u00a0al., 1999), suggesting that these bacteria may utilize different iron\u2010uptake system to obtain iron from the host. Unlike E.\u00a0chaffeensis and A.\u00a0phagocytophilum, current analysis found that the three Neorickettsia spp. encode a bacterioferritin (NHE_RS01470; Table\u00a0S1, under role category \u2018Transport and binding proteins\u2019), which can capture soluble but potentially toxic Fe2+ by compartmentalizing it in the form of a bioavailable ferric mineral inside the protein's hollow cavity. In the family Anaplasmataceae, bacterioferritin is also found in the Wolbachia endosymbiont of insects or nematode (Kremer et\u00a0al., 2009). This could be due to differences in their life cycle and invertebrate host: the entire life cycles of Neorickettsia and Wolbachia spp. are within trematodes, insects, or nematodes with limited labile iron pools, whereas Ehrlichia and Anaplasma live within mammalian blood cells and tick vectors fed on blood rich in iron (Fig.\u00a01)."

Although few genes involved in LPS biosynthesis were identified in the draft genome of Candidatus \u2018X. pacificiensis\u2019, it was not expected to possess a functional LPS biosynthesis pathway (Kwan and Schmidt, 2013).",
                                "Interestingly, nearly all genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis are identified in N.\u00a0helminthoeca, A.\u00a0marginale and Wolbachia wMel (endosymbiont of insect Drosophila melanogaster) or wBm (endosymbiont of nematode Brugia malayi) in the family Anaplasmataceae. On the contrary, only a very limited numbers of genes in peptidoglycan biosynthesis are present in the genomes of N.\u00a0risticii, N.\u00a0sennetsu, E.\u00a0chaffeensis, E.\u00a0ruminantium and A.\u00a0phagocytophilum (Fig.\u00a05). This suggests that the ancestors of the family Anaplasmataceae have undergone independent but parallel loss of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic genes and genome reduction.",
                                "Analysis of N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome suggests that it can perform de novo synthesis of d\u2010Ala\u2010d\u2010Ala from pyruvate, meso\u20102,6\u2010diaminopimelate (mDAP) from l\u2010Asp and undecaprenyl diphosphate (Und\u2010PP) through terpenoid biosynthesis pathways (isopentenyl\u2010 and farnesyl\u2010diphosphate). Although undecaprenyl diphosphatase like E.\u00a0coli phosphatidylglycerophosphatase B (PGPase B, PgpB) homologue was not found in N.\u00a0helminthoeca, N.\u00a0helminthoeca encodes two putative PgpA superfamily proteins (NHE_RS00895 and NHE_RS01205) that might function as PGPases to produce Und\u2010P from Und\u2010PP. A flippase (MurJ, NHE_RS02395) that transports anhydromuropeptide into periplasm was also identified in N.\u00a0helminthoeca (Fig.\u00a05).",
                                "The incorporation of anhydromuropeptide subunits into the murein sacculus requires multiple enzymes like MtgA, MrcA/B, FtsI (PbpB), PbpC, MrdA (Pbp2), MrdB, DacF, Pal, MreB/C (Vollmer and Bertsche, 2008; Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2010); however, only three genes encoding MrdA, FtsI (PbpB) and DacC were identified in N.\u00a0helminthoeca (Fig.\u00a05). In addition, except for an AmpG permease (NHE_RS03475) that can transport components of peptidoglycan into the cytoplasm, N.\u00a0helminthoeca lacks all necessary enzymes required for the degradation and recycling of peptidoglycan, including lytic transglycosylases (LTs), AmpD, AnmK, LdcA, Mpl, YcjI/G, NagA/B/K/Z, PepD and MurQ (Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2010). Furthermore, the T4SS usually encodes specialized LTs that hydrolyse and facilitate the local disruption of peptidoglycan, allowing for efficient transporter assembly across the entire cell envelope (Mushegian et\u00a0al., 1996). For example, a specialized LT virB1 homologue (rvhB1) was identified in Rickettsia spp. that encode pathways for biosynthesis and degradation of peptidoglycan; however, virB1 homologue was not identified in N.\u00a0helminthoeca and other members of the family Anaplasmataceae (Gillespie et\u00a0al., 2010). Our previous electron microscopy showed that only two layers (outer and inner) of membranes and no thickening of the inner or outer leaflet of the outer membrane were present in N.\u00a0helminthoeca (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991), suggesting that N.\u00a0helminthoeca might not possess a peptidoglycan layer.",

As several peptidoglycan components are potent stimulants for innate immunity and antimicrobial responses in host immune defensive cells (Dziarski, 2003; Guan and Mariuzza, 2007; Sukhithasri et\u00a0al., 2013), the presence of these components in N.\u00a0helminthoeca could elicit antimicrobial and inflammatory activities in leucocytes and may account for the high acute mortality of SPD (Philip, 1955; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991) compared to less severe or chronic infections caused by other Neorickettsia, Ehrlichia, or Anaplasma spp. that lack peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes."

This study found N.\u00a0helminthoeca, like other sequenced members of the family Anaplasmataceae, encodes all three lipoprotein\u2010processing enzymes (Lgt, LspA and Lnt; Table\u00a0S10; Gupta and Wu, 1991; Paetzel et\u00a0al., 2002). Computational analysis with LipoP 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP; Juncker et\u00a0al., 2003) identified thirteen putative lipoproteins in N.\u00a0helminthoeca (Table\u00a0S10), which may also be involved in pathogenesis and immune response in infected canids as in E.\u00a0chaffeensis (Huang et\u00a0al., 2008). Homologues of several N.\u00a0helminthoeca lipoproteins are also identified as lipoproteins in N.\u00a0risticii, including OmpA, CBS domain protein and VirB6 family proteins (Table\u00a0S1 and S10; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009).",
                                "Computational analysis using the pSort\u2010B algorithm predicted only four outer membrane proteins, two of which (BamD lipoprotein and beta\u2010barrel OMP BamA, also called Omp85/YaeT), are part of the beta\u2010barrel assembly machinery (BAM) and essential for the folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins of Gram\u2010negative bacteria (Surana et\u00a0al., 2004; Table\u00a04). Unlike Ehrlichia and Anaplasma spp. that encode a diverse members of the OMP\u20101/P28/MSP2/P44 outer member superfamily proteins (Pfam01617), Neorickettsia spp. encode only one group of putative outer surface proteins that falls into this PFAM family (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006). This group of proteins consists of three N.\u00a0helminthoeca surface proteins (NSP1/2/3), which are approximately 30\u00a0kDa in mass and likely surface\u2010exposed based on their similarities to Ehrlichia P28/Omp\u20101 (Ohashi et\u00a0al., 1998a, 2001), A.\u00a0phagocytophilum P44 (Zhi et\u00a0al., 1998) and N.\u00a0risticii/N.\u00a0sennetsu NSPs (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2010, 2011; Fig.\u00a06B and Table\u00a04).",
                                "In addition to NSP family OMPs, several studies have identified additional sets of potential surface proteins in other Neorickettsia spp., which include a 51\u2010kDa protein (P51) and Neorickettsia strain\u2010specific antigens (SSA; Biswas et\u00a0al., 1998; Vemulapalli et\u00a0al., 1998; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2004; Lin et\u00a0al., 2009; Gibson et\u00a0al., 2010, 2011). P51 belongs to an orthologue cluster (cluster 409) that exists in all Rickettsiales (Dunning Hotopp et\u00a0al., 2006), and is highly conserved among all sequenced Neorickettsia spp. including N.\u00a0helminthoeca (NHE_RS00965) and the SF agent (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2004; Fig.\u00a06A). Previous studies have shown that P51 is the major antigenic protein recognized in horses with Potomac horse fever, and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti\u2010P51 antibody on non\u2010permeabilized N.\u00a0risticii organisms showed a ring\u2010like labelling pattern surrounding the bacteria, indicating that P51 is a surface\u2010exposed antigen (Gibson and Rikihisa, 2008). P51 of N.\u00a0sennetsu was demonstrated as a porin (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2010). Phylogeny estimation (Fig.\u00a06A), SignalP prediction (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) and two\u2010dimensional structures (Fig.\u00a0S2) suggests that similar to P51 of N.\u00a0sennetsu and N.\u00a0risticii, N.\u00a0helminthoeca P51 is likely a \u03b2\u2010barrel protein localized to the outer membrane.",

Unlike N.\u00a0risticii or N.\u00a0sennetsu that encodes two to three tandem genes of non\u2010identical SSAs, N.\u00a0helminthoeca only encodes one SSA protein (NHE_RS03855, 35\u00a0kDa; Fig.\u00a06C, Table\u00a04 and S9). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the SSA family proteins in N.\u00a0sennetsu and N.\u00a0risticii likely expanded following divergence from N.\u00a0helminthoeca, but prior to the divergence of N.\u00a0risticii and N.\u00a0sennetsu (Fig.\u00a06C). Sequence analysis also identified several intramolecular tandem repeats in N.\u00a0helminthoeca P51 and SSA proteins (Table\u00a0S9), suggesting that they might play important roles in pathogenesis and pathogen\u2013host interactions (Citti and Wise, 1995; Smith et\u00a0al., 1996)."

In agreement with our previous electron microscope images (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991), analysis of N.\u00a0helminthoeca genome indicates that it did not produce a type 4 pili. Therefore, outer membrane proteins play critical roles in bacterium\u2013host cell interactions and induce strong humoral immune responses (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1992, 1994; Zhi et\u00a0al., 1998; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 2004; Ohashi et\u00a0al., 1998b; Gibson et\u00a0al., 2011).

The immunoreactivities of these surface proteins were analysed using defined N.\u00a0helminthoeca IFA\u2010positive dog sera (Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991). Western blot analysis results showed that P51, NSP1/2/3 and SSA proteins were recognized by antisera from NH1 and NH3 dogs experimentally infected with N.\u00a0helminthoeca by feeding trematodes\u2010parasitized fish and seroconverted (IFA titres\u00a0of 1:640 and 1:1280, respectively, using N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010infected DH82 cells as the antigen; Rikihisa et\u00a0al., 1991), with NSP2 and SSA as the strongest sero\u2010reactive antigens (Fig.\u00a07C,D). In addition, N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010positive dog sera from naturally infected dogs from southern California recognized P51 and SSA and weakly against NPS3, whereas NSP1 and NSP2 were only detected by \u2018M\u2019 sera (Fig.\u00a07E,F). As a control, antisera from the horse experimentally infected with N.\u00a0risticii did not react with any of these membrane proteins from N.\u00a0helminthoeca (Fig.\u00a07B). These data indicate that N.\u00a0helminthoeca OMPs including P51, SSA and NSPs can be recognized by the immune system of N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010infected dogs.",

This study also showed that approximately 78\u201380\u00a0kDa and 64\u00a0kDa proteins were the major antigens shared by N.\u00a0helminthoeca, N.\u00a0risticii, N.\u00a0sennetsu and E.\u00a0canis (Rikihisa, 1991b; Fig.\u00a07B\u2013D). These cross\u2010reactive antigens were likely more conserved heat\u2010shock proteins or molecular chaperones, and their molecular weights were different from predicted outer membrane proteins of N.\u00a0helminthoeca analysed in the current study (from 23 to 51\u00a0kDa). Therefore, in current Western blotting with the dilution of sera at 1:400, horse sera against N.\u00a0risticii recognized none of N.\u00a0helminthoeca OMPs (Fig.\u00a07B), whereas dog sera against N.\u00a0helminthoeca only detected proteins at ~64 and 80\u2010kD from N.\u00a0risticii (Fig.\u00a07C,D), suggesting that these recombinant OMPs could be used for specific diagnosis of N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010infected dogs."

In this study, we determined and analysed the complete genome sequence of N.\u00a0helminthoeca, providing a valuable resource necessary for understanding the metabolism of N.\u00a0helminthoeca and its digenean host associations, the evolution and phylogeny among Neorickettsia spp., potential virulence factors of N.\u00a0helminthoeca, pathogenic mechanisms of SPD and environmental spreading of N.\u00a0helminthoeca and trematodes infection in nature. Comparative genomics data of three Neorickettsia spp. of known biological significance is expected to help elucidating biology of other Neorickettsia spp. in the environment.",
                "As SPD progression is rapid, and the case fatality rate is quite high, prevention and early diagnosis of SPD are critical. The serological assay based on defined outer membrane protein antigens is simple, consistent, specific, objective and convenient, thus helps generating epidemiological information on N.\u00a0helminthoeca exposure among various wild and domestic animals to raise awareness of SPD. Similar to bats that are the definitive hosts of Acanthatrium oregonense trematodes, the vector of N.\u00a0risticii transmission (Gibson et\u00a0al., 2005; Gibson and Rikihisa, 2008), the definitive hosts of N.\u00a0helminthoeca\u2010infected trematodes in nature are likely asymptomatic, but have antibodies against N.\u00a0helminthoeca.",
                "Furthermore, these recombinant proteins can be applied to develop a simple and rapid serodiagnostic test for SPD in dogs in the future. The limitation of the assay is, as in any other serologic assays, false negative results at early stages of infection and in immunosuppressed dogs. Future steps necessary for the test to become applicable for clinical diagnosis are to determine sensitivity and specificity of the test using a larger number of well\u2010defined canine specimens from broader geographic regions. For this and understanding the pathogenesis and canine immune responses in SPD, culture isolation of additional N.\u00a0helminthoeca strains is desirable. Further characterization of the antigenic surface proteins of N.\u00a0helminthoeca could provide valuable candidates for the development of rapid, sensitive and specific serodiagnostic approaches or preventive vaccines for SPD."
