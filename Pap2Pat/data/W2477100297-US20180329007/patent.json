For example, MRS can noninvasively detect subtle biochemical changes in human tissue to provide molecular-level information of metabolism. Since spectroscopic measurements are typically taken in either the frequency domain or time domain, spectroscopic techniques can be divided into the frequency-resolved and the time-resolved methods."

It will nevertheless be understood that the embodiments or examples are not intended to be limiting. Any alterations and modifications in the disclosed embodiments and any further applications of the principles disclosed in this document are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.",
                        "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) can simultaneously acquire magnetic resonance (MR) data regarding both subtle changes in the chemical composition of a sample and anatomic spatial information regarding the sample. However, MRSI has not been widely accepted as a clinical tool because the MR data acquisition is very time consuming. For example, it may take more than thirty minutes to acquire an image with a 32\u00d732 acquisition matrix using a Point Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence. Furthermore, the strong water signal from traditional imaging techniques may overwhelm the tiny metabolite signal, which is generally 10,000 times weaker that the water signal. While outer volume suppression (OVS) may be used to prevent spectral contamination by peripheral lipid and water signals using spatial pre-saturation bands. However, the precise placement of the spatial pre-saturation bands is challenging, time consuming, and it requires special technician training and skills.",
                        "Described herein are examples of systems, methods, and other embodiments associated with phase cycled MR spectroscopic imaging (PCSI). The systems, methods, and other embodiments acquire data using frequency resolved techniques rather than time resolved techniques of conventional MRSI. The frequency resolved technique uses a radio frequency phase to sweep through a targeted frequency range in a spectrum, thereby reducing the acquisition time. The frequency range may be targeted based on a prior knowledge of the spectrum or a specifically targeted substance, such as a metabolite. More particularly, PCSI adjusts the phase of the RF to sweep through the desired frequency range. The sweep may target a specific metabolite having signal peaks at frequencies corresponding to the target metabolite. Therefore, the sweep may be non-continuous to focus on the frequencies associated with the target metabolite. This is simpler than changing the magnetic field strength or the RF frequency as is typically done. The phase-sweep method of PCSI allows flexibility for non-uniform frequency sampling, which speeds up the acquisition. For example, the sweep rate may be less than 100 milliseconds (ms) per image.",
                        "PCSI may be implemented with an ultra-low flip angle to generate a sharp response function and achieve high spectral resolution with very low specific absorption rate (SAR). The flip angle, also called tip angle, is the amount of rotation the net magnetization (M) experiences during application of an RF pulse. In some embodiments, the RF pulses have an ultra-low flip angle, for example, a flip angle of less than 1\u00b0. Additionally, the PCSI method simplifies scanning by making spatial suppression unnecessary. Accordingly, the described systems, methods, and embodiments make MR data acquisition more efficient and flexible to facilitate faster spatial encoding and non-uniform sampling in the frequency domain.",
                        "FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a method associated with phase cycled magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. The method 100 may operate in conjunction with an MR system. For example, PCSI may be used as a tool in clinical settings for noninvasively obtaining spatial and metabolic information from a sample on a molecular level. Thus, metabolic mapping can be provided. For example, PCSI may be used to detect J-coupled metabolites in humans.",
                        "At 110, an excitation radio frequency (RF) pulses having a low flip angle is applied to a sample. The RF pulses deliver energy to the nuclei in the sample, which puts the nuclei into a higher energy state. By producing a net transverse magnetization the MR system can observe a response from the excited system. The sample may be biological tissue, such as a human brain tissue.",
                        "In one embodiment, the RF pulses may be a portion of a pulse sequence. The pulse sequence may include more excitation RF pulses or a preselected set of gradient pulses that are repeated during a scan of the sample rather than a continuous wave RF. The interval between pulses as well as the amplitude and shape of the pulses may be altered based, at least in part, on specific type of pulse sequence. For example, the pulse sequence may be balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence.",
                        "Furthermore, the flip angle of the RF pulses is based, at least in part, on the pulse sequence. The low flip angle may be a flip angle of 5\u00b0 or less. The flip angle is the angle to which the net magnetization is rotated or tipped relative to the main magnetic field direction via the application of an RF excitation pulse at the Larmor frequency. In some embodiments, the RF pulses have an ultra-low flip angle of approximately 1\u00b0 or less. The flip angle is ultra-low to generate a sharp response function and achieve high spectral resolution.",
                        "At 120, the phase of the RF pulses is adjusted to sweep through a frequency range based, at least in part, on phase cycled spectroscopic imaging (PCSI). As the pulse sequence progresses, the phase of the RF pulses is cycled. For example, the bSSFP sequence may sweep through a plurality of phase cycles.",
                        "At 130, a frequency range may be uniformly or non-uniformly sampled as a result of the phase of the RF pulses being adjusted at 120. The sampling occurs at one or more frequencies in the frequency range. The phase may be cycled to specifically target the one or more frequencies. The sampling may be uniform and, for example, be sampled at frequencies separated by a predetermined interval. Alternatively, the sampling may be non-uniform at one or more predetermined target frequencies. The one or more frequencies may be selected based, at least in part, on specific substances that are trying to be identified in the sample. For example, if specific metabolites are being targeted, the frequencies corresponding to those metabolites may be targeted. By sweeping through a frequency range at specific frequencies, substances that emit at those frequencies are more easily identified. Thus, target frequencies may be selected from the frequency range based, at least in part, on a target metabolite; and then sampling may be performed at the target frequencies.",
                        "At 140, MR data is acquired at the frequencies in the frequency range from the sweep. Thus, the MR data is acquired in the k- and frequency-space (i.e., k-f-space), unlike conventional MRS imaging which acquires the MR data in the k-t-space. In some embodiments the MR data is acquired in the k-frequency-time space.",
                        "In one embodiment, the data set may be graphed to illustrate spectral peaks that may correspond to frequencies associated with the targeted metabolites. Alternatively, the MR data set may be used to generate images of the sample. In one embodiment, the MR data is used to generate the images of the sample may illustrate and differentiate between varying levels of metabolites in the sample. For example, the images may be parametric maps of the sample. As discussed above, the MR data acquisition is sped up by non-uniformly sampling in the frequency range because specific frequencies may be targeted.",
                        "FIG. 2A illustrates one embodiment of a scheme diagram 200 of a bSSFP pulse sequence associated with phase cycled magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. As discussed above, the pulses having an ultra-low flip angle (See e.g., act 110 of FIG. 1) and cycled phase (See e.g., act 120 of FIG. 1) may be based, at least in part, on a bSSFP pulse sequence. The scheme diagram 200 illustrates pulses 210, 220, and 230 of a bSSFP pulse sequence. The pulses 210, 220, and 230 are each associated with an ultra-low flip angle, \u03b1 and a specific phase, \u03c6n.",
                        "Steady-state magnetization peaks 215 and 225 of a magnetization profile result from a series of pulses like 210 and 220. In particular, the magnetization profile associated with a specific cycled RF phase results in at least one sharp response peak at the at least one frequency corresponding to the presence of a substance, such as a metabolite, in the sample.",
                        "The scheme diagram 200 also illustrates two repetition time (TR) periods 240 and 250. The TR periods 240 and 250 may be selected based, at least in part, on a desired response peak. For example, the average chemical shift between body fat and water is approximately 3.35 ppm corresponding to a chemical shift on 3T scanner of about 413 Hz. Therefore, TR period of 2.4 ms may be selected for TR periods 240 and 250 so that the period of the response function is 417 Hz, and thus closer to the water-fat shift 413 Hz.",
                        "The scheme diagram 200 also illustrates four time echo (TE) periods 243, 247, 253, and 257. The TE periods represent the time in milliseconds between the application of the RF pulses 210 and 220 and the magnetization peaks 215 and 225 of the magnetization profile after the RF pulses 210 and 220. For example, TE period 243 is the TE period before the magnetization profile 215, and TE period 247 is the TE period subsequent to the magnetization profile 215. The TE period may be based, at least in part, on TR. The value of TE may be changed to change the pulse sequence to, for example, Fast Imaging with Steady-State Precession (FISP) or time reversed FISP, referred to as, PSIF instead of bSSFP. The length of the TE period can also be selected based, at least in part, on desired T1 and/or T2 contrast.",
                        "Thus, the bSSFP pulse sequence represented by the scheme diagram 200 includes a number of parameters, such as flip angle, \u03b1, TR, and TE that are selected by virtue of the derivation of the pulse sequence. An example derivation of a bSSFP pulse sequence is detailed below.",

PCSI does not require OVS so as to avoid the above issues, reduce subjective variability, and greatly simplify the scanning procedures.
