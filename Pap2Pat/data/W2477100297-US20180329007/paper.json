    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging has become an important tool in clinical settings for noninvasively obtaining spatial and metabolic information on a molecular scale. Conventional spectroscopic imaging is acquired in the time domain and its clinical application is limited by the long acquisition time, restricted spatial coverage and complex suppression and reconstruction procedures. We introduce a fast MR spectroscopic imaging technique in the frequency domain, termed phase-cycled spectroscopic imaging (PCSI). PCSI uses a balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence with an ultra-low flip angle to achieve very high acquisition efficiency with a short repetition time. This approach enables faster frequency sweeping by changing the cycled RF phase and using flexible non-uniform sampling and it greatly reduces the RF energy deposition in tissue. With its intrinsic water and fat suppression, PCSI more closely resembles routine clinical scans because it eliminates the suppression steps. We demonstrate that it is feasible to acquire PCSI spectra in a phantom and in humans and that PCSI provides an efficient spectroscopic imaging method, even for J-coupled metabolites. PCSI may enable spectroscopic imaging to play a larger role in the clinical assessment of the spatial tissue distribution of metabolites.",

                        "The magnetization profiles of the steady-state magnetization were generated for different flip angles, as shown in Fig. 1a. As the flip angle decreased to less than 1\u00b0, the profile became a single sharp peak. In Fig. 1b, the real part of the magnetization profile is a pure absorption shape and is much narrower than the magnitude profile. This real magnetization profile can serve as a perfect frequency response function for spectroscopic imaging. Using this response function, we can excite only a very narrow range of frequencies (approximately 1.9\u2009Hz) and simultaneously suppress the signal at other frequencies. Therefore, we can acquire an MR image at a specific frequency point using this steady state with an ultra-low flip angle."

                        "The peak locations of the response function are determined by the cycled RF phase \u03c6 in Fig. 1c. The cycled phase corresponds to a certain off-resonance frequency, \u0394f, determined via the equation \u0394f\u2009=\u2009\u03c6/(2\u03c0\u2009\u00b7\u2009TR) derived from equation [S12] in the Supplemental Information. By changing the cycled RF phase, the peak location can be shifted to a target frequency within a frequency period, [\u22121/(2TR), 1/(2TR)], which corresponds to one RF phase cycle. Changing the cycled RF phase is much easier than changing the magnetic field, as was required in early frequency-resolved techniques. Taking advantage of the high acquisition efficiency of the bSSFP sequence, we obtained a PCSI sweep rate of approximately 13 images/s (or 76.8\u2009ms per image), which is much more efficient than the early frequency-sweeping methods (which might have a sweep rate of approximately 1\u2009Hz/s). This high sweep rate enables PCSI to acquire multiple averages in order to improve its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). After obtaining a series of MR images at different frequency points, we can generate a spectrum in each voxel."

We performed simulations with multiple small flip angles to validate the theoretical feasibility of PCSI and investigate the importance of the choice of RF flip angle. In the simulations, a spectrum was created with four peaks: water, choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), which were assumed to be delta functions with magnitudes of 10,000, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.2, respectively. Figure 2a shows the original spectrum with a water peak at 200\u2009Hz. Figure 2b shows the simulated spectrum with an optimal flip angle, \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.24\u00b0, computed using equation [S11] with TR\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009ms. This simulated spectrum was generated by convolution of the real response function in Fig. 1b and the spectrum in Fig. 2a. All three metabolic peaks could easily be observed (Fig. 2b), having heights proportional to the prescribed values. Figure 2c shows the simulated spectrum with \u03b1\u2009=\u20091\u00b0, in which the three small metabolic peaks are barely detectable. The three metabolic peaks are not appreciable in Fig. 2d with \u03b1\u2009=\u20093\u00b0. These simulations demonstrate that it is theoretically feasible to obtain a spectrum by using PCSI and that the metabolic peaks become smaller and eventually disappear as the flip angle increases. Therefore, an ultra-low flip angle is crucial if a spectrum is to be acquired by PCSI."

PCSI data were acquired using a modified bSSFP sequence, in which the cycled RF phase was changed for each measurement by using a non-uniform frequency-sampling scheme. Figure 3a shows PCSI signals in a region of interest (ROI), including nine voxels (18.75\u2009\u00d7\u200918.75\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009mm, or 5.3\u2009cm3) at the center of the phantom. The peaks on either side are water peaks, which wrap around as a result of the periodic response function. Phase correction based on the water peaks was performed to convert the real component of each complex signal to a pure absorption shape. The inset enlargement in Fig. 3a clearly demonstrates the three metabolite peaks in the real signal. This signal can be converted to the spectrum, as shown in Fig. 3b after post-processing (see the Methods section for details). Figure 3c shows a spectrum from a single voxel (6.25\u2009\u00d7\u20096.25\u2009\u00d7\u200915\u2009mm, or 0.59\u2009cm3) at the same location as that in Fig. 3b. The single-voxel spectrum is similar to the spectrum in Fig. 3b from a larger ROI but has slightly more noise. For comparison, Fig. 3d shows a spectrum from a single voxel (20\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009mm, or 8\u2009cm3) obtained by using the conventional time-resolved SVS sequence. The two spectra shown in Fig. 3b (PCSI) and 3d (SVS) were similar and had consistent peak positions. This phantom study demonstrates that PCSI can require much less time than the time-resolved SVS method to acquire comparable spectra.",

Figure 5 shows two spectra from a uniform PCSI with a 64\u2009\u00d7\u200932 matrix and a higher in-plane resolution (3.75\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009mm).

Although the two spectra appear similar, the spectrum in the larger ROI has smaller peaks than does the single-voxel PCSI spectrum because of the high field inhomogeneity near the edge. Both spectra had less noise than did the spectrum in Fig. 6a, because the locations in Fig. 6c,d were closer to the head coil where the SNR is higher. The greater peak width in the PCSI spectra was mainly due to greater field inhomogeneity, because PCSI acquired data from a whole slice, whereas SVS acquired data from only a single voxel.",

The two sets of maps were then interpolated and overlaid on a high-resolution T2-weighted image (voxel size: 0.52 \u00d7 0.52\u2009mm) for visual comparison.

There were four lesion foci (1\u20134) visible in one T2-weighted image, in which lesion 1 corresponds to a surgical cavity and lesions 2 through 4 represent tumor foci. Figure 8 shows the importance of full coverage of the whole slice because of the heterogeneity of the tumors. It took approximately 4\u2009min longer for CSI to acquire parametric maps with only 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910 voxels than for PCSI to acquire maps with 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932 voxels. The main tumor (lesion 1) can be clearly identified in the Cho/NAA ratio maps obtained with either method. However, the conventional CSI maps covered only small parts of lesions 2 and 3, which clearly demonstrate characteristic tumor profile features in the PCSI Cho/NAA map.",

A slight increase in Cho is suggested in the portions of lesions 2 and 4 covered by the CSI maps. The corresponding PCSI parametric maps also show slightly increased Cho in lesions 2 and 3, decreased NAA concentrations in all lesion foci, and resultant robust increases of Cho/NAA in lesions 2 and 3 and a modest increase of Cho/NAA in lesion 4. The reason for the increased Cho/NAA ratio in lesion 1 is unclear; it may indicate residual or recurrent tumor, but this has not been confirmed."

Fast time-resolved MRSI methods have been proposed to accelerate the acquisition121314153031323334. Of these methods, EPSI or PEPSI1214, spiral MRSI13, and SI-CONCEPT with circular echo-planar trajectories34 are the most efficient; they work by interleaving spatial k-space readouts of echo-planar, spiral, circular encoding with the spectral acquisition to speed up the acquisition and cover more volume. However, these fast MRSI techniques usually have a limited spectral width and require more complex reconstruction procedures to correct strong off-resonance effects caused by echo-planar or spiral encoding. The PCSI method provides a different means of speeding up acquisition by using adaptive sampling in targeted ranges of the frequency domain. We compared these methods based on the parameters related to speed and spectral width, which are summarized in Table 1. When SNR is not considered in this comparison, PCSI is the most efficient of the five methods compared, based on the acquisition time per slice per average. Figure S6 shows that PCSI can generate well-defined spectra for a phantom or human, even with only one average. More averages can be used to improve the SNR when necessary.",

In this study, we demonstrated a non-uniform sampling scheme that covered only three metabolite peaks (NAA, Cr, and Cho), which decreased the total acquisition time by a factor of 2.5. If we cover only a single metabolite, the acquisition time can be further reduced by a factor of 3 to 5 to achieve the total acquisition in less than 1\u2009min. PCSI may thus become suitable for studying the dynamic changes of certain metabolites."

The SNR values for the PCSI and CSI methods were 19.8 and 90.9, respectively. However, it may not be rational to compare SNRs directly in this case, because the left side of the Cho peak may not be an ideal location for measuring noise due to possible metabolite signal at short TE, and several factors influence the SNR, such as the voxel size, number of averages, acquisition matrix, sampling density, and TE value, which are not identical for the two methods.",

However, PCSI had a broader peak with a 35.7-Hz width in one human volunteer, compared to the SVS peak width of 17.5\u2009Hz in a much smaller ROI.

Prior knowledge of the specific spectrum is, therefore, required in order to develop a specialized PCSI protocol for targeted metabolites. However, this may not be a problem in most clinical scenarios. In addition, because of the signal dependence on the flip angle, PCSI is sensitive to B1 inhomogeneity, which may be the main factor causing the variations in the parametric map shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, a body transmit coil should be used instead of a surface transmit coil to reduce the effects of B1 inhomogeneity. If necessary, B1 correction or parallel transmit can be used to further reduce these B1 inhomogeneity effects48.",

First, PCSI could be implemented in 3D imaging, which could have a higher SNR and efficiency because each 3D measurement requires only one steady state. Second, the PCSI can be used in multinuclear spectroscopic imaging, such as fluorine and sodium imaging. In addition, whereas time-resolved spectroscopy has a clear advantage in single-voxel spectroscopy, the PCSI method offers a greater advantage in 2D or 3D high-resolution spectroscopic imaging, in which the number of spectral points is much smaller than the number of conventional phase encoding steps. We have successfully acquired 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932 and 64\u2009\u00d7\u200964 images; a higher-resolution spectroscopic image with a 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128 matrix may be obtainable in the future if high-order gradient shimming, superconductor coils, and parallel RF transmission techniques can be used with this PCSI technique."

                        "The protocol parameters must be precisely selected based on prior knowledge of the targeted metabolite signal. In contrast to conventional MRSI, PCSI does not require additional water- and fat-signal suppression. In PCSI, water and fat signals are intrinsically suppressed, because the very sharp response function suppresses signal that occurs far from the selected frequency, as shown in Fig. 1b. To suppress both water and fat, appropriate values of the protocol parameters, such as the TR and flip angle \u03b1, had to be selected to optimize the suppression by positioning the water and fat peaks as closely as possible, using the periodic property of the response function. To do this, the water and fat peaks had to be put into two consecutive frequency periods, as shown in Fig. S3a, so that the fat peak could wrap around to the water period as the red peak. The period length should be similar to the water-fat chemical shift for this configuration. The average chemical shift between body fat and water is approximately 3.35 ppm49, or approximately 413\u2009Hz on a 3T scanner. Therefore, a TR of 2.4\u2009ms was selected so that the period of the response function was 417\u2009Hz, the closest value to the water-fat shift of 413\u2009Hz. Period II was selected for the acquisition window because it included all the metabolite and water peaks. The fat peak was in period I and wrapped around to period II as an inverted red peak, as shown in Fig. S3a. In this case, both the water and fat peaks were located at the end of period II. The response function is different in each period, being positive for period II and negative for the two neighboring periods (I and III) in Fig. S3b. This is why the fat peak in period I was inverted and projected onto period II in Fig. S3a. To place the targeted metabolite at the center of the acquisition window, the system frequency was decreased by a certain amount (e.g., 200\u2009Hz) to shift the water peak to one side of period II in Fig. S3a. For TR\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009ms, T1\u2009=\u20091300\u2009ms, and T2\u2009=\u2009250\u2009ms, the optimal \u03b1 and the maximum amplitude are 0.24\u00b0 and 0.22, respectively, according to equation [S11]."

                        "When uniform sampling was used in the whole phase cycle (a frequency period) with a step of 1\u00b0, PCSI required approximately 11\u2009min with an acquisition matrix 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932 (360 measurements, TR\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009ms, 23 averages). By using non-uniform sampling, we can sample densely in the ranges of target metabolites and sparsely in other ranges to reduce the acquisition time. In this study, the positions of three target metabolites, NAA, Cr, and Cho, in the spectrum were calculated in order to select the specific ranges for dense sampling. NAA is located near \u2212115\u00b0, Cr is near \u22126\u00b0, and Cho is near 13\u00b0, with the water peak being shifted to 200\u2009Hz on the 3T scanner. Therefore, the dense sampling windows were selected in the ranges (\u2212142\u00b0, \u2212100\u00b0) and (\u221227\u00b0, 40\u00b0) with a step of 1\u00b0, and the step in other ranges was selected as 10\u00b0 (Fig. S4). The complete sample range of the cycled RF phase was chosen as \u2212200\u00b0 to 250\u00b0, which led to a total of 143 measurements and a total acquisition time of 4\u2009min 28\u2009s. The acquisition time was decreased by a factor of 2.5 by using this non-uniform sampling method when compared to a uniform sampling scheme with 360 measurements. With more advanced non-uniform sampling schemes, the acquisition time may be further reduced to less than 1\u2009min in the future."

A phantom filled with a brain-mimicking solution containing the metabolites NAA, Cr, and Cho was used to investigate the feasibility of the PCSI method. The PCSI data acquisition used a modified bSSFP sequence based on a TrueFISP sequence, in which the cycled RF phase changed for each measurement. A 64-channel head coil was used in the image acquisition to ensure the quality of the data. In the experiments, a single axial slice was selected, and shimming with the advance mode was performed to achieve the best field homogeneity. After shimming, the system frequency was manually decreased by 200\u2009Hz to shift the water peak toward the end of the frequency acquisition window. The protocol parameters were as follows: TR\u2009=\u20092.4\u2009ms; TE\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009ms; flip angle \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.3\u00b0; 40 dummy pulses for the preparation of the steady state; 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932 acquisition matrix; in-plane resolution 6.25\u2009\u00d7\u20096.25\u2009mm; slice thickness 15\u2009mm; bandwidth 1116\u2009Hz; 23 averages; 143 measurements using a non-uniform sampling scheme of the cycled RF phase; and total time approximately 4\u2009min 28\u2009s. A flip angle of 0.3\u00b0 was used because the actual flip angle may be smaller than the prescribed angle as a result of the electron screening effect.",

The short TE spectrum was acquired on a phantom by using the SVS protocol with a minimum TE of 30\u2009ms. The PCSI signals of J-coupled metabolites were compared with those in the short-TE SVS spectrum. To test the limits of PCSI, a higher-resolution dataset was acquired with a 64\u2009\u00d7\u200932 acquisition matrix, an interpolated in-plane resolution of 3.75\u2009mm\u2009\u00d7\u20093.75\u2009mm, and a slice thickness of 15\u2009mm. The total acquisition time was 11\u2009min 12\u2009s. Half of the coil channels were turned off because of the limited memory of the computer used for processing the data. Finally, the above non-uniform protocol was performed three times on the phantom to test its repeatability."

A single tilted axial slice was selected in the superior brains of two healthy volunteers and a patient with multifocal anaplastic astrocytoma of the brain to demonstrate the feasibility of PCSI. The protocol was the same as that used in the phantom study, except for the flip angle and the frequency shift. In the human studies, based on our experience, a flip angle of 0.5\u00b0 was used to obtain a better signal. The frequency shift was reduced to 190\u2009Hz because of the much broader water peak. Data were acquired from the first volunteer by using a 64-channel head coil (Fig. 6). Data from the second volunteer (Fig. 7) and the patient (Fig. 8) were acquired using a 20-channel head coil to demonstrate the feasibility and reproducibility.",

The image was first reconstructed by using a fast Fourier transform for each channel of the head coil. Phase correction based on the water peak was performed for each voxel to convert the real profile to a pure absorption shape, which ensured that the phases from different coil channels were consistent for each voxel. After phase correction, images from different channels can easily be combined by using a weighted summation based on their magnitude. Because of the field inhomogeneity, the position of the water peak varied for the different voxels in the image. The peaks were shifted in order to align them for subsequent processing. The baseline correction was performed by using polynomial fitting for the magnitude and phase of the profile without the metabolite signal. The profile then subtracted the fitted baseline to obtain the spectrum in units of Hertz. The spectrum was then converted to the final spectrum in parts per million (PPM). To quantify the spectrum, it was fitted using three Lorentzian functions. Normalization was performed by dividing the signal by a factor that was computed using an empirical form: the square root of the cube of the filtered sensitivity map. With the fitted spectrum, the different parameters (e.g., the amplitude and position) related to each peak could be extracted for further processing. After quantification for each voxel, the parametric maps were generated, registered, and overlaid on a high-resolution T2-weighted image. The signal-processing procedure is summarized and shown in Fig. S5; in the future, it may allow real-time metabolic maps to be generated directly on the MRI scanner without the need for manual intervention by a technician."
