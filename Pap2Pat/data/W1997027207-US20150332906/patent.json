                        "Matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometers are highly robust and capable instruments for bio-molecular analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry has been applied for identification of bacterial and viral pathogens, clinical pathology, tissue imaging, biochemistry, health research, etc. Routine performance specifications for reflector MALDI-TOF instruments often exceed 15,000 for resolution and <5 ppm for accuracy with internal calibration. Higher level instruments may exceed these specifications. This performance is sufficient for most biological applications including protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting, a technique that is highly dependent on high accuracy mass measurements of component peptides. For this reason, after resolutions exceeding 10,000 are attained, instrument accuracy is as important, if not more important, than resolution for most peptide and protein analyses."

                        "The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. Although one or more of these embodiments may be preferred, the embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted, or otherwise used, as limiting the scope of the disclosure, including the claims. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to that embodiment.",
                        "Despite the high accuracy and resolution performance of conventional MALDI-TOF instruments, many instruments demonstrate mass deviations from internally calibrated spectra significantly in excess of instrument specifications. For example, multiple spectra for the same peptide obtained within minutes of each other on the same instrument may exhibit errors ranging from under 1 ppm to 20 ppm or greater. These deviations are inconsistent ,and mass measurements for different peptides within a single mass spectrum often exhibit errors uncorrelated with other peptides in the spectrum. Further, there is no a priori method to define the accuracy of an unknown peptide mass measurement.",
                        "A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer uses an ion reflector to enhance instrument resolution and accuracy, enabling accurate mass measurements of peptides and molecules. Generally, a laser pulse ionizes a portion of the peptide sample and the time of flight between charged voltage plates and a reflector, also comprising charged voltage plates, is measured. The resulting data provides a spectrum of the peptide ion's mass over time and when data is processed, provides a quantitative analysis of the mass of ions in a sample. Further, multiple laser pulses may be used to increase the detection and spectral resolution of various peptide ions. Finally, the laser pulses for ionization may synchronize the internal clock for data acquisition.",
                        "Unfortunately, the data acquired from multiple spectra of the same peptide frequently demonstrate errors that exceed the manufacturers' claimed spectrometer specifications. Even when the variability in the peptides is evaluated to determine significance, for example via Shapiro-Wilk's test, and standard statistical methods are used to determine the characteristics of measurements either individual spectra or as a population thereof, the data demonstrates an unaccounted, significant variability. Altering the operation of the MALDI-TOF instrument by increasing the number of laser pulses or utilizing a different manufacturer's instrument, do not reduce the variability in the spectra obtained for the same peptide. These observations suggest that the factors affecting mass accuracy are systemic errors intrinsic to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers and represent a barrier to repeatable, high-resolution, and accurate analysis and identification of biological peptides, proteins, and pathogens",
                        "Generally, in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, the raw data for the flight time of all ions in the spectrometer are converted from an analog signal and assigned to digital storage medium in regular intervals, called bins, by the analog-to-digital (A/D) system. The A/D system includes a detector and a converter. In operation, the ionized molecules impinge the detector and the converter translates these events into counts, or signal intensity, within a predetermined time or period defined by the A/D system at the start of acquisition of data. The detector and the converter may be configured to operate nearly simultaneously. More specifically, the A/D system measures the signal intensity at defined time intervals with a sampling rate defined by a high speed (500-1000 MHz or higher) internal clock. In operation, the A/D system measures the intensity of ions in discrete packets of signals in a period, and the period is defined by the A/D system internal clock.",
                        "The packets of signals are subsequently stored in bins determined by the period of the internal clock. FIGS. 1A-1C show examples of peak shape in spectra that demonstrates discontinuous intensity measurements (i.e., bins) across every peak. The differences in bin spacing across the peaks of FIGS. 1A-1C are correlated with the difference in flight times for ions of different masses. The laser pulses for ionization synchronize the A/D system internal clock for acquisition. Accordingly, the start of acquisition defines the period range, thus setting the position of the bins relative to the laser pulse. All data acquired from subsequent laser pulses will be deposited into the same bins initially defined at the start of the acquisition.",
                        "Accordingly, a primary source of the variability in mass measurement derives from the discontinuous nature of measuring the flight time of ions by the analog-to-digital A/D system in the mass spectrometer. The resulting discontinuous raw time domain data results in discontinuous bins within the mass spectrum which require peak fitting for interpolation. In addition, the mass positions of the bins exhibit variation between spectra.",
                        "Imprecisions in timing of the laser pulses for ionization, or \u201cjitter,\u201d can also significantly impact mass accuracy of MALDI-TOF instruments. Jitter interferes with the clustering of mass spectral data into discrete bins, resulting in peak broadening by imprecise binning. Peak broadening increases the deleterious impact of data binning during data processing and fitting algorithms that convert raw time-domain data into mass spectral data. Data processing and fitting algorithms interpolate important peak parameters including peak-width-at-half-maximum and the actual position of the apex of the peak from the discontinuous mass spectral data such as observed in FIGS. 1A-1C. Even minor variations in the measured bin intensities and their consideration in the fitting algorithms can significantly impact the best fitted interpolation of the peak. The jitter problem further exacerbates variability by broadening the measured data and increasing the number of bins necessary for interpolation. Thus, operation of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer may inherently include the aforementioned systemic sources of random error, as well as other errors.",
                        "The present disclosure is directed to reconfiguring a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer for mitigating systemic random errors from data collection. Further, reconfiguring a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer includes a multi-step process for implementing multiple data acquisitions, collecting spectra from each acquisition, and generating a composite spectrum. This process relates to resetting the spectrometer, for example between each data acquisition. Accordingly, resetting the spectrometer may include a partial reset, such that the A/D system is reset, without resetting or depowering the laser, voltage plates, or data processors. A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer configured accordingly provides an efficient platform for improving accuracy during high-resolution analysis of samples. More specifically, the system acquisition software, rather than a user, may conduct additional calculations to determine if the variability of the systemic error is acceptable. Embodiments disclosed herein exploit the combined effects of jitter and electronic variability in the A/D detector system to provide random repositioning of the data bin positions by restarting the acquisition. Statistical mapping of the population of data provides more accurate mass measurements than individual spectra can reliably achieve.",
                        "For example, in an embodiment, data acquired from 10 or more replicate measurements and analyzed using descriptive statistics provide more consistent and accurate data with the possibility of a priori identification of mass measurements exhibiting greater probability of error than is possible using convention MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In contrast, increases in laser pulses for each spectrum do not improve accuracy appreciably. Spectral averaging resolves multiple underlying mechanisms contributing to variability in these instruments including discontinuous measurements of the time-of-flight data for ions resulting in binning of data in the mass spectrometer, laser timing imprecision (jitter), and likely peak fitting algorithms required for converting discontinuous time-domain data into mass-domain data.",
                        "An illustrative MALDI-TOF resetting system may include an acquisition engine, a collection engine, and an analysis engine. The acquisition engine initializes the collection of a first spectrum from a sample, including activating the laser pulse and the A/D system. The collection engine stores the first spectrum, and resets the acquisition engine. After a predetermined number (\u201cn,\u201d any positive integer) of spectra are collected, the analysis engine provides statistical analysis, including but not limited to, averaging of the collected spectra. In general, the analysis engine may be configured to mark, annotate, or remove spectra that have characteristics outside a predetermined or expected range, such as but not limited to, a standard deviation. In some configurations, the acquisition engine, collection engine, and analysis engine may be implemented as a processor executing software modules. More specifically, the MALDI-TOF resetting system may include software modules that partially reset a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer in order to minimize or eliminate random error from the A/D system operation.",
                        "For example, a user input or computer signal may initiate the operation of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Acquiring a spectrum from a sample includes activating a laser, detecting the molecular impacts, and binning the number of impacts in bins to form a first spectrum. Collecting the spectra comprises storing the first spectrum on a storage medium. Additionally, once the spectrum is stored, the spectrometer, or a component thereof, is reset. After resetting, another spectrum from the sample is acquired. Resetting and acquiring spectra from the sample continue until a predetermined number of spectra are stored. Analyzing the stored spectra comprises averaging the spectra and statistical mapping of the spectra data. Without limitation by any particular theory, analyzing the stored spectra comprises averaging out random systemic errors and identifying outliers through statistical analysis.",
                        "FIG. 2 shows an exemplary schematic for a mass spectrometer system 200 according to the present disclosure. The system 200 comprises a spectrometer 202, a collector 212, and an analyzer 218. The spectrometer 202 generally comprises an analyte plate 204, a laser 206, an ion path 208 and a reflector 210. Generally, the ion path 208 and the reflector 210 include voltage plates configured and acting as ion lenses. The collector 212 includes a detector 214 and a first storage medium 216. The analyzer 218 comprises a computer, having a processor 220, a second storage medium 222, a third storage medium 226, and an interface 228. Generally, the interface 228 may include a computer display, keyboard, and remote pointing device, such as a mouse.",
                        "FIG. 3 shows an exemplary method 300 for operating a mass spectrometer system 200 such as is illustrated in FIG. 1. Though depicted sequentially as a matter of convenience, at least some of the actions shown may be performed in a different order and/or performed in parallel. Additionally, some embodiments may perform only some of the actions shown. In some embodiments, at least some operations of the method 300, as well as other operations described herein, can be implemented as instructions stored in a computer-readable medium and executed by one or more processors.",
                        "Conventionally, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers ionize samples, detect the ion molecules, store the samples on a processing device, and repeat the experiment without resetting the device or any system therein. Thus, any random system errors are intrinsically found throughout all the spectra of that data. In contrast, the method 300 includes, in block 302, initiating a spectral analysis by ionizing the sample with a laser 206. In block 304 the detector 214 detects ion molecule impacts as a spectrum. The spectrum is stored in block 306. The spectrometer 202 is reset in block 308. After a predetermined number of spectra are stored, the method 300 comprises analyzing the stored spectra, in block 310, to generate a composite spectrum for the sample. In block 312, the composite spectrum is provided to a user. In the method 300, resetting the spectrometer 202 before each spectrum acquisition randomizes systemic errors, such that statistical analysis will mitigate or average out the random errors during analysis of the stored spectra.",
                        "More specifically, ionizing the sample, in block 302, also activates the internal clock of the spectrometer 202. The activated clock provides the start time for detecting ion-molecule impacts in block 304. Additionally, the activated clock sets the data collection periods, or bins, for detecting ion molecule impacts in block 304 and assigning the ion molecule counts within each bin. Storing the spectrum, in block 306, includes temporarily preserving the binned ion molecule counts, for example on the first storage medium 216 described hereinabove. Resetting the spectrometer, in block 308, further includes repeating the steps of ionizing the sample with the laser 206 in block 302, detecting ion molecule impacts on the detector 214 as a spectrum in block 304, and storing the spectrum in block 306. After a predetermined number of spectra are stored, analyzing the stored spectra in block 310 includes statistically analyzing the spectra. Without limitation by any particular theory, analyzing the spectra further includes averaging the binned data. Providing the stored spectra to a user in block 312 includes providing the user the analyzed spectrum, or a more specifically a composite spectrum. The composite spectrum generally includes the averaged spectra, or alternatively, the averaged spectra are further processed by a user-specified algorithm. In some instances, a user-specified algorithm may alter the binning periods or the detector sensitivity to ion molecule impacts in order to alter the statistical mapping of each spectrum's data.",

The computer system 400 includes a processor 402, which may be referred to as a central processor unit, a computer processor unit, or a CPU. The processor 402 is in communication with memory devices including secondary storage 404, read only memory (ROM) 406, random access memory (RAM) 408, input/output (I/O) devices 410, and network connectivity devices 412.

It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well-known design principles. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), because, for large production runs, the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well-known design principles, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application-specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus, likewise a computer that has been programmed and/or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.",

Read only memory 406 is a non-volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage 404. The random access memory 408 is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions.
