    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has few therapeutic targets, making nonspecific chemotherapy the main treatment. Therapies enhancing cancer cell sensitivity to cytotoxic agents could significantly improve patient outcomes. A BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) pathway gene expression signature (BPGES) was derived using principal component analysis (PCA) and evaluated for associations with the TNBC phenotype and clinical outcomes. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the relative expression levels of phospho-BAD isoforms in tumour samples. Cell survival assays evaluated the effects of BAD pathway inhibition on chemo-sensitivity. BPGES score was associated with TNBC status and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer samples of the Moffitt Total Cancer Care dataset and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). TNBC tumours were enriched for the expression of phospho-BAD isoforms. Further, the BPGES was associated with TNBC status in breast cancer cell lines of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Targeted inhibition of kinases known to phosphorylate BAD protein resulted in increased sensitivity to platinum agents in TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines. The BAD pathway is associated with triple-negative status and OS. TNBC tumours were enriched for the expression of phosphorylated BAD protein compared to non-TNBC tumours. These findings suggest that the BAD pathway it is an important determinant of TNBC clinical outcomes.",

                "Approximately 17% of the 1 million cases of breast cancer diagnosed annually worldwide are of the triple-negative (oestrogen receptor\u2013 (ER-)/progesterone receptor\u2013 (PR-)/HER2-negative) phenotype1. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is biologically aggressive and disproportionately affects premenopausal women, with the highest prevalence found among women of African and Hispanic descents2\u20135. African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian women account for approximately 47%, 23%, and 15% of TNBC cases, respectively5,6. After adjusting for age and stage at diagnosis, African-American women are almost 3 times more likely than Caucasian women to have TNBC6.",
                "Few targeted agents are available for the treatment of TNBC tumours. The standard of care for patients with TNBC is nonspecific chemotherapeutic agents, such as those that induce DNA damage (ie, platinums, anthracyclines) or microtubule destabilizations (paclitaxel, taxotere)7. Although TNBC tumours are initially sensitive to standard chemotherapy, patients with this disease are at greater risk of recurrence and typically experience a very short disease-free survival span6,8,9. Among patients who have incomplete responses to chemotherapy, those with TNBC experience worse overall survival (OS) outcomes than those with non-TNBC10. To date, no targeted agents have shown broad effectiveness against TNBC. Although polyADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors have shown some efficacy, the effectiveness of these targeted agents is limited to relatively small subsets of TNBC patients11\u201313 therefore, there is a critical need for more active therapeutic strategies.",
                "BCL2 antagonist of cell death (BAD) is a member of the BCL2 family of proteins, which includes inhibitors and promoters of apoptosis, such that cell survival is determined by the relative ratio of proapoptotic (e.g., BIM, BAD, BAX, BAK) and antiapoptotic (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, A1, BAG-1) family members14\u201317. BAD selectively hetero-dimerizes with BCL-xL and BCL-2 but not with BAX, BCL-xs, MCL-1, A1, or itself. When BAD dimerizes with BCL-xL, BAX is displaced, mitochondrial membrane permeability increases, and apoptosis is induced18. BAD function is regulated by phosphorylation (including serine \u2212112, \u2212136, and \u2212155)19\u201321. When phosphorylated, BAD is unable to heterodimerize with BCL-2 or BCL-xL, which frees BCL-xL to dimerize and functionally sequestrate BAX, resulting in BAX no longer being free to induce apoptosis18. Thus, BAD phosphorylation determines whether BAX is displaced from BCL-xL to drive cell death. BAD is phosphorylated at serine-136 by protein kinase B (PKB/AKT)22. In contrast, serine-112 of BAD is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase\u2013activated protein kinase-1 (MAPKAP-K1, also called RSK) and protein kinase A (PKA). Serine-155 at the centre of the BAD BH3 domain is phosphorylated preferentially by PKA, which also inhibits BCL-xL binding21,23,24. Conversely, the activity of a series of phosphatases, including PP1, PP2A, and PPM1 (PP2C/PPM1A), as well as calcineurin, has been shown to have proapoptotic effects via dephosphorylation of BAD25,26.",
                "We previously reported that the expression of the BAD pathway and levels of phosphorylated BAD protein were associated with chemoresistance in ovarian cancer27\u201329. Due to the reported molecular similarities between ovarian cancer and TNBC30\u201332, we evaluated the influence of BAD pathway expression on chemoresponse in TNBC. In this report, we show that the BAD pathway expression can differentiate between triple-negative phenotype breast cancers and those that express ER and/or PR in tumours and cell lines; furthermore, the BAD pathway expression was found to be associated with OS in 2 independent clinico-genomic datasets. We also show that, compared to non-TNBC cases, TNBC tumours were enriched in the expression of phosphorylated BAD isoforms. We demonstrated in vitro that targeted inhibition of kinases known to phosphorylate BAD protein sensitized TNBC cells but not ER-/PR-positive cells to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin."

                        "The BAD pathway gene expression signature (BPGES) was developed from the GeneGo Metacore\u2013defined BAD Apoptosis and Survival Pathway using the genes that showed importance in the PCA model. These included BAX, BCL2, EGFR, PDK1, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PPP1CA, PPP2CA, PPP3CA, PPM1A, YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAG, YWHAH, YWHAQ, and YWHAZ. All genes in the BPGES have previously been shown to directly or indirectly influence the phosphorylation status and/or apoptotic activity of BAD protein; these are BAX34,35, BCL-2, EGFR36,37, PDK1 (PDPK1)38, PI3 kinase (PIK3CA, PIK3CB)36, PP1 (PPP1CA)39, PP2A (PPP2CA)40, Calcineurin (PPP3CA)41, (PP2C) PPM1A25,27,42, and 14.3.3 (YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAG, YWHAH, YWHAQ, YWHAZ)43. The PCA methodology was used to derive a BPGES pathway score that would represent overall gene expression levels for these BAD-pathway genes. Genes and probe sets used in the PCA model for the different datasets are listed in the Supplemental Table\u00a0S1. Only 1 probe set was used per gene, which was selected on the basis of the highest expression value in the TCC dataset samples.",
                        "PCA is a well-established technique for unsupervised data analyses and dimensional reduction, as described by Joliffe and Ma44,45. We and others have previously shown that the first component of a PCA model, defined as PC1, can successfully compare the expression of gene signatures and describe pathway activation in tumour samples. It can also be used for survival analyses29,38. In brief, the first step when using PCA to compare signature expression in clinico-genomic datasets is to create a subdataset by selecting only the probesets in the given gene expression signature. To calculate the BPGES, probesets representing 16 genes within the BAD pathway were reduced to a set of uncorrelated principal components. After removing the column mean (mean centring) and scaling each column-to-unit variance, the PC1 score can be calculated. That is, the pathway score is \u2211wixi, a weighted-average expression among the BAD-pathway genes in which xi represents gene i expression level, wi is the corresponding weight (loading coefficient) with \u2211w2i\u2009=\u20091, and the wi values maximize the variance of \u2211wixi. PC1 describes the direction in the N-dimensional space (in which N is the number of genes) that maximizes the explained variance. By not using all the variation in the data, PC1 is stable to random noise, can handle missing values, and provides a simple score for each sample. Thus, the PC1 score is a numeric value that summarizes the expression pattern of the entire signature and represents an overall similarity measurement between samples on the basis of their expression profile for the selected genes. The corresponding loadings are related to the variables (e.g., Affymetrix probe sets) and reflect relative importance in the PCA model."

Pearson\u2019s correlation test was used to evaluate the correlations between phospho-BAD isoform expression scores and other phospho-BAD isoforms as well as the BPGES.

Case selection for the TMA was based on the availability of gene expression data, clinical information, and tissue. The TMA was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the expression of phospho-BAD-serine-112 (Ser112, A00295, Genscript, Atlanta, GA, USA, 1:800 dilution), phospho-BAD-serine-136 (Ser136; A01156, Genscript, 1:200 dilution), and phospho-BAD-serine-155 (Ser155; AB28825, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:50 dilution). BAD-Ser112, -Ser136, and \u2013Ser155 are mouse BAD protein designations and are analogous to human BAD-Ser75, -Ser99, and \u2013Ser118, respectively29,46,47. Antibodies recognizing these phosphorylated serine residues are cross reactive between human and mouse BAD protein. For simplicity, only the mouse designations are used in this manuscript. Before samples were stained, they were deparaffinised and rehydrated using xylene, followed by serial dilutions of ethanol. Slides were stained using a Ventana Discovery XT automated system (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA) with proprietary reagents, in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, slides were deparaffinised on the automated system with EZ Prep solution (Ventana). A heat-induced antigen retrieval method was used in Cell Conditioning 1 (Ventana). Primary antibody optimization and tissue staining was performed under the direction of the study pathologist using manufacturer-suggested methods and control tissues. Antibodies were diluted in PSS antibody diluent (Ventana), incubated for 60\u2009minutes at room temperature, rinsed with diluent, and incubated with the appropriate horse radish peroxidase- (HRP-) linked secondary antibodies for 16\u2009minutes. Antibody binding was detected using the Ventana ChromoMap kit, and slides were counterstained with haematoxylin. Slides were then dehydrated and coverslipped in accordance with normal laboratory protocol. To compare phospho-BAD isoform levels, expression scores were determined by the study pathologist using the product of intensity and cellularity, in which an intensity of 1 was considered weak, 2 moderate, and 3 strong, and a cellularity of 1 was \u226433%, 2 was 34% to 65%, and 3 was \u226566%48,49. In addition, Definiens software was used to generate a histo-expression score (H-score). Stained TMA slides were scanned using the Aperio (Vista, CA, USA) AT2 with a 200x/0.8NA objective lens at a rate of 3\u2009minutes per slide via Basler trilinear-array detection. Each core was then segmented for individual analyses using Spectrum\u2019s TMA block software. Image analyses were performed to segment positive staining of various intensities using an Aperio Positive Pixel Count v9.0 algorithm with the following thresholds: hue value\u2009=\u20090.1, hue width\u2009=\u20090.5, colour saturation threshold\u2009=\u20090.04, intensity weak positive (high)\u2009=\u2009220, intensity weak positive (low)\u2009=\u2009intensity positive (high)\u2009=\u2009175, intensity positive (low)\u2009=\u2009intensity strong positive (high)\u2009=\u2009100, and intensity strong positive (low)\u2009=\u20090. The algorithm was applied to the entire digital core image to determine the percentage of positive biomarker staining by applicable area. Tissue cores on the TMA were manually inspected by the study pathologist and removed from the analysis when less than 50% of the tissue was remaining, tissue folds were evident, or obvious artefacts were present."

                        "To evaluate the overall expression and activation of the BAD pathway in breast cancer, PCA was used to generate a BPGES score. The genes comprising the BPGES included BAX, BCL-2, EGFR, PDK1, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PPP1CA, PPP2CA, PPP3CA, PPM1A, YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAG, YWHAH, YWHAQ, and YWHAZ. PCA modelling of the BPGES in a gene expression dataset, comprised of 106 breast cancer patient samples (53 non-TNBC and 53 TNBC), indicated that a high BPGES score was associated with breast cancers displaying the triple-negative phenotype, with a mean BPGES score of \u22121.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24 for non-TNBC and 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 for TNBC (unpaired t test, P\u2009=\u20094.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221219; Fig.\u00a01a). As the TNBC group contained a significantly higher percentage of grade 3 tumours, we evaluated whether the BPGES was associated with disease grade. The mean BPGES score was 1.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58 for low-grade disease (grades 1 and 2) versus 1.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24 for high-grade disease (grades 3 and 4; t test, P\u2009=\u20090.4973); therefore, it was not associated with grade of disease. The association between the BPGES and triple-negative status was confirmed by using hormone receptor positive (non-TNBC) and TNBC samples from TCGA (n\u2009=\u2009408 [84 TNBC, 324 hormone receptor positive], mean BPGES scores were \u22120.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 for non-TNBC and 2.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17 for TNBC [P\u2009=\u20091.89\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221226]; Fig.\u00a01b).

Figure\u00a01c shows the performance of the individual genes of the BPGES in the TCC dataset (n\u2009=\u2009106).

As TNBCs are more aggressive than nonTNBCs, we evaluated the role of the cell cycle in the association between the BPGES and decreased OS among patients with breast cancer.

Mean histological expression scores (cellularity\u2009\u00d7\u2009intensity) of all cores/cases based on pathologist assessment of IHC staining (scale of 1\u20133) suggested that TNBCs expressed higher mean levels of phospho-BAD-Ser136 (P\u2009=\u20090.0078) than non-TNBC samples.

Similar to our results shown in the tumour samples, gene expression data from 42 breast cancer cell lines (28 TNBC, 14 non-TNBC) indicated a differential expression of the BAD pathway in TNBC cell lines, with a mean BPGES score of \u22121.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.33 in non-TNBC cells versus a mean BPGES score of .90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25 in TNBC cells (unpaired t test, P\u2009=\u20094.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127; Fig.\u00a03A,B). Figure\u00a03c shows the performance of the individual genes of the BPGES in the CCLE dataset. As shown, the performance of BPGES genes in breast cancer cell lines was similar to their performance in tumour samples. Therefore, cell line models were used to determine whether disruption of the BAD pathway via BAD protein kinase inhibitors could enhance the cytotoxic effects of nonspecific chemotherapy. To do this, a panel of randomly selected ER+/PR+ (MCF-7, T47D) and TNBC (Hs578t, MDA-157, MDA-231, BT549, MDA-436, MDA-468) cell lines were treated with inhibitors of BAD protein kinases. The 5-year survival probability HRs suggested that TNBC patients have a 2-fold increased risk of death if their tumours display increased expression of phospho-BAD-Ser136 (AKT phosphorylation site) or phospho-BAD-Ser155 (PKA phosphorylation site). As such, we evaluated whether BAD pathway disruption was capable of sensitizing TNBC cells to cisplatin by using the AKT inhibitor perifosine and the PKA inhibitor H89. Figure\u00a03d shows the relative phosphorylated (active)/native protein expression levels of AKT and PKA as determined by densitometry analyses of replicate Western blots.Figure 3The BPGES was associated with triple-negative status in breast cancer cell lines of the CCLE.

                        "Data obtained from MTS cell viability assays showed that most TNBC cells treated with a fixed dose of perifosine or H89 were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin than cells treated with cisplatin alone. In contrast, the sensitivity of non-TNBC cells to cisplatin did not significantly change or was lessened in the presence of perifosine and H89 (Fig.\u00a04a,b). Comparing cisplatin IC50 values in the presence and absence of perifosine or H89, which were calculated using the sigmoidal dose-response algorithm (as implemented in GraphPad Prism 7), indicated that the potentiation of cisplatin by a BAD protein kinase inhibitor was significant in the majority of TNBC cells but not in non-TNBC cells (Table\u00a01). The ability of an AKT or H89 inhibitor to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity depended on the expression of the active phosphorylated isoform of the target kinase in TNBC cells. Treatment of the TNBC cell MDA-468 with perifosine but not H89 potentiated the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. Densitometry analyses of immunoblots suggested that nearly 80% of AKT within this cell line was phosphorylated. In contrast, MDA-468 expressed almost no phosphorylated PKA. However, there were exceptions. In some TNBC cell lines, such as Hs578t, which showed high levels of phosphorylated AKT and low levels of phosphorylated PKA, cisplatin cytotoxicity appeared to be enhanced by H89 but not by perifosine. The reason for this was not explored. However, kinases other than AKT, such as PAK-1 and PKC-iota54, have been shown to phosphorylate BAD protein at ser-136 and may have more dominant roles in this cell line.Figure 4Targeted inhibition of BAD protein kinases increases platinum sensitivity in TNBC cells.

As shown, depletion of BAD protein in BT549 (Fig.\u00a05a) and MDA468 (Fig.\u00a05b) did not change cell line sensitivity to cisplatin but resulted in decreased sensitivity to perifosine. Similar results were observed with H89 in BT549 (Fig.\u00a05c) and MDA436 (Fig.\u00a05d) cells.

                "Although TNBCs account for only about 17% of all breast cancers1,8,55, they are heterogeneous, biologically aggressive, and carry a poorer prognosis than the growth factor receptor\u2013driven or hormone receptor\u2013driven breast cancers9,10,55. The earlier age of onset and lethality of TNBC underscores the need for the development of more efficacious therapeutic strategies. Few targeted agents have shown effectiveness against this aggressive form of breast cancer, and the majority of TNBC patients are treated with nonspecific chemotherapeutic agents, including platinums, anthracyclines, and taxanes7. Therapies that enhance cancer cell sensitivity to cytotoxic agents could significantly improve patient outcomes.",
                "In this study, we show that the BAD pathway is a targetable biomarker to increase the response of TNBC to nonspecific chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin. PCA was used to develop an expression signature based a subset of genes that comprise the GeneGo Metacore\u2013defined BAD pathway. This BPGES) was derived using 16 genes that showed the most importance within the PCA model, including BAX, BCL-2, EGFR, PDPK1 (PDK1), PIK3CA, PIK3CB (PI3 kinase), PPP1CA (PP1), PPP2CA (PP2A), PPP3CA (Calcineurin), (PPM1A) PP2C, YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAG, YWHAH, YWHAQ, and YWHAZ (14.3.3). The BPGES was capable of delineating TNBC tumours from hormone responsive (non-TNBC) tumours in independent clinic-genomic breast cancer datasets, including TCC (n\u2009=\u2009106) and TCGA (n\u2009=\u2009408) as well as the breast cancer cell lines of the CCLE (n\u2009=\u200942). Furthermore, the BPGES was associated with decreased survival probability in both the TCC and TCGA cohorts. TNBC is known to be more aggressive than hormone responsive tumours. Therefore, we evaluated whether the performance of the BPGES was an artifact of increased TNBC proliferation. As described above, although the BPGES showed a correlation with the Hallmark cell cycle signature (r2\u2009=\u20090.54), log-rank tests of Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that cell cycle alone could not explain the association between the BPGES and decreased OS among patients with breast cancer (log-rank P\u2009=\u20090.13). All genes within the BPGES have previously been shown to directly or indirectly influence the phosphorylation status and/or apoptotic function of the BAD pathway, including BAX34,35, BCL-2, EGFR36,37, PDK1 (PDPK1)38, PI3 kinase (PIK3CA, PIK3CB)36, PP1 (PPP1CA)39, PP2A (PPP2CA)40, calcineurin (PPP3CA)41, (PP2C) PPM1A25,27,42, and 14.3.3 (YWHAB, YWHAE, YWHAG, YWHAH, YWHAQ, YWHAZ)43. The performance of the individual genes were similar in the TCC and TCGA cohorts and in the CCLE cell lines despite the fact that different gene expression platforms were used for each dataset. Genes encoding 3 of 4 documented BAD protein phosphatases, PP2C25,27,42, PP2A40, and calcineurin41, showed decreased expression, whereas genes encoding the kinases EGFR36,37, PDK138, and PI3 kinase36 showed increased expression in TNBC compared to non-TNBC cases and cell lines. This suggests an expression profile in TNBC that favoured the phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD protein. In parallel, TNBC cases displayed increased expression of 5 out of 6 genes encoding 14.3.3. compared to non-TNBC cases. 14.3.3 has been reported to inhibit BAD-induced cell death by binding and sequestering BAD when phosphorylated on Ser136, a known AKT phosphorylation site43. Overall, the performance of the individual genes of the BPGES suggests a prosurvival phenotype in TNBC cases compared to non-TNBC cases. Indeed, immunohistochemistry analyses of a study-generated TMA showed that TNBC cases expressed higher levels of phospho-BAD isoforms, most notably the AKT phosphorylation site BAD-Ser136 compared to non-TNBC cases. We next sought to determine whether inhibition of BAD pathway signalling would increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to a nonspecific chemotherapy agent. HRs of 5-year survival curves suggested that TNBC patients were at 2-fold increased risk of death if their tumours expressed increased levels of phospho-BAD-Ser136 or phospho-BAD-Ser155. Therefore, we used the AKT inhibitor perifosine and the PKA inhibitor H89. Treating TNBC cells but not non-TNBC cells with perifosine or H89 increased the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin. Although there were exceptions, the ability of the BAD protein kinase inhibitor to enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity appeared to be dependent on the expression of the target kinase. The inhibition of AKT and PKA did not sensitize all TNBC cell lines to cisplatin. Although the reasons for this were not explored, it must be noted that there are several antiapoptotic BAD protein kinases, including PAK1, PKC-iota, ERK, IKK, C-raf, and CK2, that were not evaluated in this study54.",
                "These results are consistent with the work of others. It is well known that AKT phosphorylation of BAD protein is a negative regulator of the proapoptotic function of BAD protein56. Consistent with our data, other groups have shown that activated AKT signalling is increased in TNBC57\u201360 and that inhibition of AKT signalling can increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to nonspecific chemotherapies61. Others have shown that targeting the pro-survival BCL2 proteins of the BAD pathway, using the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, sensitized basal-like breast cancers to chemotherapy62. Although the classifications of basal-like and triple negative are not synonymous, the majority of basal-like breast cancers are triple negative63.",
                "Collectively, our results suggest that expression and activation of the BAD pathway may be important mechanisms that TNBC could use to resist therapeutic apoptotic stimuli. Therefore, therapies that enhance TNBC sensitivity to cytotoxic agents could significantly improve patient outcomes. The data presented here suggest that the BAD pathway may be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of TNBC."
