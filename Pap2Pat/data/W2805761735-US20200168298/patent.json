                        "The use of genetic testing in personalized medicine is increasingly allowing for movement away from a standard of care that has been generalized for the general population and toward a more personalized, genome-based approached aimed at preventing, diagnosing, and treating disease in the individual.",
                        "The rapid development of high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has made a considerable impact on clinical genomics research. In principle, modern HTS platforms offer time-efficient, cost-effective and highly accurate means for genotyping clinically relevant genes. However, analyzing the sequencing data has posed problems in certain instances. Since many functionally and clinically important genes are highly polymorphic and have multiple copies as we as sequencewise-similar pseudogenes with which the frequently hybridize/fuse with to produce novel alleles, analyzing the sequence data is highly challenging from a computational point of view. In addition, some of these genes have been subject to structural alterations, making their allelic decomposition (i.e., determining the number of copies of a gene and the exact sequence content of each of its copies) computationally difficult.",
                        "Current computational tools are unable to utilize HTS data to perform allelic decomposition of genes that have been subject to structural alterations. Available structural variation detection tools aim to identify the type and locus of large \u201cstructure altering events\u201d (e.g., large-scale deletions, novel sequence insertions, segmental duplications, and inversions), typically in uniquely mappable regions of the genome. In contrast, available copy number alteration detection/copy number phasing tools aim to identify the number of copies of a particular gene in each chromosome under the implicit assumption that the gene duplications or deletions always affect the entire (rather than a part of the) gene of interest, but do not reconstruct the exact sequence content of the gene. While certain methods have been developed that utilize small variants for copy number phasing, these methods are limited to detecting copy number changes only. They cannot also determine the exact sequence content of each copy of a gene that has been subject to structural alterations. No existing tool aims to find out what happens when structural alterations affect genes with multiple copies or those with highly homologous pseudogenes. Such genes are algorithmically difficult to resolve, as read that originate from such genes have high mapping ambiguity.",
                        "Those genes involved in the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and/or Excretion (ADME) of pharmaceutical compounds are examples of highly polymorphic genes having multiple copies.",
                        "Accurately determining the genotypes of genes involved in the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and/or Excretion (ADME) is essential to drug treatment and dosage decisions, and is highly recommended prior to treatment with certain drugs. Unfortunately, existing array-based genotyping assays are limited in scope in that they do not cover all genes and all potential variants of each gene, can be costly, and sometimes inaccurate.",
                        "Genotyping ADME genes can play an important role in identifying responders and non-responders to pharmaceutical compounds, avoiding adverse events, and optimizing drug dose, and assist treatment and dosage decisions for more than 90% of all prescribed drugs.",

However, rare variations are common across sites that impact drug response. The PGRNseq capture protocol was recently introduced, and offers a targeted sequencing platform for ADME gene. The PGRNseq protocol currently targets 84 ADME genes. Algorithmic challenges in exact ADME genotyping exist however, due to the presence of pseudo-genes, structural rearrangements, and copy number variation. This has resulted in a major roadblock to the use of HTS platforms in pharmacogenomics analysis. Additional obstacles such as the short read lengths offered by prominent sequencing technologies and non-uniformity of sequencing coverage for alternate sequencing technologies further complicate ADME genotyping."

                        "Described herein is a tool and methods that can utilize HTS data to perform allelic decomposition of genes that have been subject to structural alterations. In some embodiments, the methods comprise i) finding out how many copies of a gene there are and which HTS read belongs to which copy (i.e., mapping ambiguity resolution), and ii) implicitly or explicitly assembling each copy of the gene from the read set (this is inherently intermingled with mapping ambiguity resolution) and identify the gene copy's origins relative to a reference genome. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise a) identifying all structural alteration breakpoints and carefully reconstructing the sequence content of each breakpoint region, while taking into account all micro-structural alterations, indels, and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) each copy of the gene has been subject to, and b) identifying fusions/hybridizations between the gene and its highly homologous pseudogenes. The tools and methods available to date fail to address these issues.",
                        "Existing structural variation discovery tools are based on the following general strategies: detection of variants using discordantly mapping paired-end reads (e.g., Variation Hunter (Hormozdiari, F. et al. (2009), Genome Res, 19:1270-1278; Hormozdiari, F. et al. (2010), Bioinformatics, 26:i350-i357) and Hydra (Quinlan, A R et al. (2010), Genome Res, 20:623-635), which report only the rough loci of structural variants but not their sequence content); detection of variants using split-read mappings (e.g., Socrates (Schroeder, J. et al. (2014), Bioinformatics, 40:1064-1072)); and detection of variants by mapping de novo assembled contigs to a reference genome (e.g., Barnacle (Swanson, L. et al. (2013), BMC Genomics, 14:550) and Dissect (Yorukoglu, D. et al. (2012), Bioinformatics, 28:i179-i187), which are RNA-Seq analysis tools that can also be used to analyze genomic data).",
                        "There are several tools available that employ a combination of these strategies (e.g., Pindel (Ye, K. et al. (2009), Bioinformatics, 25:2865-2871), Delly (Rausch, T. et al. (2012), Bioinformatics, 28:i333-i339), novoBreak (Chong, Z. et al. (2017), Nat. Methods, 14:65-67), and GASVPro (Sindi, S. et al. (2012), Genome Biol, 13:R22), which only consider uniquely mapped reads and cannot identify alterations in repetitive DNA. No available tool, even those designed to identify gene fusions only (e.g., defuse (McPherson, A. et al. (2011), PLoS Comput Biol, 7:1-16)), aims to reconstruct the sequence content of a fusion between a gene and a highly similar pseudogene. Further, no existing tool aims to infer variants from targeted capture sequencing data which are highly non-uniform in coverage (e.g., PGRNseq, which is discussed herein). Even tools that aim to genotype a particular gene such as the ADME gene CYP2D6, namely Cypiripi (Numanagic, I. et al. (2015), Bioinformatics, 31:i27-i34) and Astrolabe (formerly Constellation; Twist, G. P. et al. (2016), NPJ Genomic Med, 1:15007), respectively work only on uniform coverage sequencing data, or can determine the gene's sequence content only if it differs from a reference sequence by SNVs but not structural variation.",
                        "The methods provided herein address these challenges, and provide for the first time a framework to perform allelic decomposition of any gene of interest in HTS data. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein can perform allelic decomposition of any gene that differs from a reference genome by i) SNVs, ii) short indels, iii) full gene duplications or deletions (leading to copy number alteration), iv) partial gene duplications or deletions, as well as v) \u201cbalanced\u201d fusions (i.e., those that preserve the structure of a gene) with highly homologous pseudogenes (the fusions can have one or more breakpoints). In some embodiments, all possible combinations of genomic alterations are identified, and the sequence content of all copies of a gene are determined in whole genome or targeted genome sequencing data.",
                        "Over 300 genes have been identified to participate in some way in the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and/or Excretion (ADME) of pharmaceutical compounds. Of these, 32 have been identified as core ADME genes, essential to ADME of pharmaceutical compounds. An additional 184 genes have been identified as related ADME genes, which includes those genes determined to be related to ADME of pharmaceutical compounds. ADME genotyping plays an important role in identifying responders and non-responders to pharmaceutical compounds, avoiding adverse events, and optimizing drug dose. Over 230 FDA-approved drugs provide pharmacogenomic information in their labeling.",
                        "Advances in DNA sequencing over the past two decades made it possible to explore the human genome in unprecedented detail. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is now routinely performed in less than a day, and the Illumina HiSeq X sequencing system has driven the cost of WGS under $1,000 dollars per sample. Furthermore, Illumina-style WGS data offers high coverage depth, uniform read distribution and low error rates, all of which are useful for genotyping purposes. However, WGS is still considered costly and time-consuming compared to the targeted genotyping panels. Whole exome sequencing (WES) provides cheaper alternative to WGS, but in its current iteration, it is not able to sequence non-coding regions. This makes WES unsuitable for genotyping of ADME pharmacogenes, where variations in the non-coding regions can significantly affect phenotype.",
                        "Much of clinical genotyping is still performed through targeted genotyping panels. These targeted genotyping panels, like Affymetrix DMET\u2122 Plus arrays and the Illumina ADME assays are able to detect a common set of predefined variations and genotypes. However, rare or personal variants, while functionally significant, often cannot be captured by these panels. Rare variants of pharmacogenes (e.g., CYP2D6) can impact drug response. As a result, new HTS-based targeted captures are being introduced to help identify novel variants in a cost-effective manner. A prime example is the PGRNseq capture protocol, which was recently introduced and offers a targeted sequencing platform for ADME gene. The PGRNseq protocol currently targets 84 ADME genes (Table 1; see Gordon, A. S., et al., (April 2016) Pharmacogenet Genomics 26(4):161-168 (Epub January 2016)), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). For each of these genes, PGRNseq covers at least its exonic region and a few kilobases upstream and downstream of gene's untranslated region (UTR), covering more than 960 KB of the human genome through its first iteration (PGRNSeq v.1). PGRNseq maintains backward-compatibility with previous DMET\u2122 Plus and Illumina ADME assays by targeting all single nucleotide variations (SNV) included in those panels. In total, more than 960 KB of genome is covered by PGRNseq. PGRNseq capture products are sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, which provides low error rates while maintaining very high depth of coverage (averaging 500\u00d7 per chromosome). Most importantly, PGRNseq is significantly less expensive than WGS and even WES. For example, PGRNseq is up to ten times less expensive than WGS. Thus, PGRNseq offers a competitively-priced platform for clinical genotyping of targeted genes, while providing all the benefits of standard WGS sequencing. And even though PGRNSeq (or WGS) data from some of the pharmacogenes are relatively straightforward to interpret, other, more difficult genes such as CYP2D6 have proven difficult to analyze.",
                        "PGRNseq inherits some of the problems that come with WGS, including short read length and data interpretation issues. Genotype inference for ADME genes harboring various structural rearrangements still presents a major challenge. In order to assist the analysis of such structural variants, the second iteration of PGRNseq covers the whole genic clusters containing the targeted ADME genes (e.g., for CYP2D6, the entire 30 KB CYP2D cluster is sequenced, which includes CYP2D6 and pseudogenes CYP2D7 and CYP2D8).",
                        "The present disclosure provides the first computational tool to exactly genotype ADME genes based on PGRNseq and Illumina WGS data, with the capability to accurately handle gene duplications, fusions, and genomic deletions. Available CYP2D6 genotyping tools such as Cypiripi (see Numanagic, I. et al. (2015), Bioinformatics, 31:i27-i34 and Astrolabe (see Twist, G. P. et al. (2016), NPJ Genomic Med, 1:15007) are not only limited to uniform coverage WGS data, but are also unable to properly detect some structural rearrangements. And while genotyping CYP2D6 is valuable in that its encoded enzyme is involved in metabolism of 20-25% of clinically prescribed drugs, neither of these tools provide support for genotyping other ADME genes. Previous attempts to analyze PGRNseq data, which relied on SNP callers to infer genotype, resulting in Mendelian inconsistencies (see Gordon, A. S. et al. (April 2016), Pharmacogenet Genomics, 26(4):161-168 (Epub January 2016)). The methods and systems described herein are demonstrated on a large selection of WGS and PGRNseq samples to be a highly accurate and very fast tool for ADME genotyping.",
                        "The tool and methods described herein is not limited to the genotyping of ADME genes, and can be applied broadly to any gene or group of genes. While embodiments and examples provided herein describe the genotyping of ADME genes, the described methods can be similarly applied to other genes by those of skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure.",
                        "The tool and the methods described herein are capable of reconstructing the structure and sequence content of each copy of a particular gene present in a sample being analyzed. Following the well-established star-allele nomenclature in pharmacogenomics, a star-allele of a gene is defined as a gene sequence which differs from the \u201cwild type\u201d (or canonical) gene sequence by a (non-empty) set of mutations. Thus, reconstructing the sequence content of a gene copy is identical to identification of the gene copy's star-allele, which could either be already known or possibly novel.",
                        "Two types of mutations, and as a consequence, star-alleles, are distinguished. Any mutation that has an impact on the resulting protein product of the gene is referred to herein as a \u201cgene-disrupting mutation\u201d (also known as a \u201cfunctional mutation\u201d). Gene-disrupting mutations include codon-changing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels, as well as mutations outside the coding regions that affect the protein enzyme activity. Star-alleles which are defined solely by gene-disrupting mutations are referred to as \u201cmajor star-alleles,\u201d and are assigned a unique number. For example the canonical \u201cwild type\u201d star-allele is always assigned *1, while *2 describes a star-allele that harbors one or more gene-disrupting mutations capered to the *1. If a new major star-allele is discovered that has not previously been reported in the literature, new star allele is identified by *nl+1, where l is the number of major star-alleles known up to that point. It is possible that two major star-alleles can share a common mutation.",
                        "A mutation that does not impact the protein product is referred to herein as a \u201cneutral mutation\u201d (also known as a \u201cnon-functional mutation\u201d). Any major star-allele can be extended with neutral mutations, and such extension is referred to as a \u201cminor star-allele.\u201d If a copy of a gene includes only neutral mutations, then it is considered to be an extension of the wild-type star-allele. In order to distinguish various minor star-alleles, a unique symbol, and in certain instances, a pair of symbols, is attached to the major star-allele's number for each such extension. For example, minor star-allele 2A is formed by taking the set of gene-disrupting mutations for major *2 allele and extending it with some neutral mutation; *2B is formed in a similar manner, however the sets describing the neutral mutations of *2A and *2B are not identical, although the sets describing their gene-disrupting mutations are. If a new minor star-allele that is an extension to the star-allele *\u03ba is discovered, it is commonly called *\u03baX where X is the lexicographically smallest letter which has not yet been used for minor alleles of *\u03ba.",
                        "In view of these definitions, the tool and methods described characterize the sequence composition of each copy of a gene present in a sample, which is by definition equivalent to inferring the major and minor star-allele label of such gene copy. Where there is a need to define a new star-allele, this is done by minimizing the number of novel mutations and structural variations that need to be added to or subtracted from a known star-allele to describe the new star-allele. In certain aspects, and as depicted in FIG. 1, the methods for genotyping 100 (i.e., characterizing the sequence composition of a gene) comprise the steps of: 1) read alignment and mutation detection 102, where high throughput sequencing (HTS) reads are aligned to a reference genome and mutations present in a target gene region are identified; 2) copy number and structural variation estimation 104, where copy number of the gene is identified, and if present, various structural variations are identified; 3) major star-allele identification 106, where the major star-allele of each gene copy is established; 4) genotype refinement 108, where the supporting set of neutral mutations is assigned to each major star-allele, and the \u201cscore\u201d of such an assignment (see \u201cGenotype Refining\u201d section) is used to rank each allelic configuration identified; and 5) genotype calling 110, where the final genotype (i.e. minor star-allele) is obtained by choosing the set of allelic configurations with the best ranking score. In instances where multiple configurations have the same score, all configurations will be reported as equally likely genotypes.",

In some embodiments, known possible gene arrangements are obtained from databases such as the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database (available at cypalleles.ki.se), the Leiden Open Variation Database (available at databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes), which includes variant data for many ADME genes, a gene-specific database such as The Human Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Database (available at cypalleles.ki.se/), or a general genomic database such as Gene, which is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene).

Some genes, such as CYP2D6, are also prone to structural variations/alterations in the form of deletions and duplications that affect only part of the gene. For example, high sequence homology and close physical proximity between CYP2D6 and related pseudogene CYP2D7 results in the formation of gene conversions, producing hybrid genes where a prefix or suffix of the hybrid gene is from the pseudogene CYP2D7, or gene conversions, where one or more non-prefix/suffix contiguous segment of the hybrid gene is from CYP2D7. Some genes, including CYP2D6, have more than one pseudogene, however typically only one such pseudogene is highly homologous and difficult to distinguish. In many cases, the existence of structural variations has a substantial impact on the resulting protein products, making accurate characterization important for proper phenotype prediction. While the following description will use CYP2D6 as a representative gene, all models and calculations can be similarly applied to other ADME genes.",

In the case where such a deletion or a duplication impacts only part of a gene or a pseudogene, it is called a partial gene deletion or a partial gene duplication. As all structural variations/alterations resulting in the formation of hybrid genes are defined at the level of whole introns and exons, it is assumed that partial gene deletions or partial gene duplications involve one or more contiguous sequence(s) of whole introns and exons. As a result, it is assumed that each exon and each intron of the hybrid gene originates from either CYP2D6 or CYP2D7 as a whole.",

Each hybrid configuration of CYP2D6/2D7 is represented by a vector v of length 2n such that v[i]=l if l copies of region ri are present in the configuration and v[i]=0 if no such copy is present. A single copy of CYP2D6, for the case when no structural variations are present, will be represented as a vector v consisting of n ones followed by n zeros. Analogously, this applies to a single copy of CYP2D7 (zeros followed by ones).

((2016) J Mol Diagn, 18(1):109-123), NA12003 actually contains *35 allele instead of *2, and this discrepancy is mostly due to the inability of TaqMan assays to properly genotype *35 allele (see Riffel, A. K., et al (2015) Genotyping, 6:312). A similar occurrence was observed in case (4) with samples NA19834, NA19835 and NA19836, with SNP c.1716 G>A. This SNP differentiates alleles *2 and *45, and it is not present in TaqMan assays (see Fang, H. et al. (2014) Pharmacogenomics J, 14(6):564-572).",

For example, TaqMan assays often confuse it with other alleles (see Riffel, A. K., et al (2015) Genotyping, 6:312). One of the reasons for this is c.137 insT, which defines *15 allele but is also present in all *13 fusion alleles. However, Pratt, V. M., et al. ((2016) J Mol Diagn, 18(1):109-123) confirmed that NA19239's actual genotype contains *15, which matches the present results as well.",

((2014) Pharmacogenomics J, 14(6):564-572) confirmed that *76 is not present, which matches the prediction by the present methods. Furthermore, no evidence of increased coverage in CYP2D7 region was found that would be suggested by the existence of *76. These cases indicated that the present methods provided more accurate genotyping results than currently used genotyping panels, especially in the presence of recently discovered alleles. In the case of NA10860, Cypiripi detected *4 allele duplication, which PCR-based methods miss this duplication. Prediction by the present methods was cross-validated by running the present methods on Illumina HiSeq X WGS NA10860 sample publicly available from export.uppmax.uu.se/a2009002/opendata/HiSeqX_CEPH/. This sample was sequenced with approximately 28\u00d7 depth of coverage (or 14\u00d7 per chromosome). By simple coverage analysis, it was evident that there were at least 3 copies of CYP2D6, since average coverage of CYP2D6 region was 42\u00d7.

Although Astrolabe offers similar performance, it requires VCF data as an input, but generation of such data usually takes significant amounts of system resources.

After further investigation, it was concluded that genotyping panels used for validation purposes made either ambiguous or incorrect calls in these cases. Such examples include inability to detect alleles CYP2D6*35 and CYP2D6*45, which were identified as CYP2D6*2 due to the inability of validation kits to detect the discerning SNPs. Additional cases include the misidentification of the CYP2D6*15 allele, which is highly similar to the pseudogene CYP2D7.

The fifth case depicts partial deletion of the gene, while the sixth case shows how to handle cases when parts of the gene (exon 2 in this case) are duplicated.",
                                "The present methods provided accurate genotype calls for other genes as well, as demonstrated in Table 7. In all samples, the accuracy rate was above 99%. A few mismatched calls were mainly due to that unlike PGRNseq v.2, the PGRNseq v.1 reagent does not target the CYP2D6-associated pseudogenes, making accurate genotype calling in the presence of pseudogene-derived mutations significantly harder.",
                                "**Novel Alleles**",
                                "The present methods detected the presence of novel major star-alleles in GeT-RM samples, namely a novel CYP2D6*10-like allele in NA17012 (*10 with c.77 G>, A), novel DPYD alleles (based on either *4, *5, or *6, with c.85 A>G in NA07357, NA10859, and NA24027) and a novel CYP2C19 allele in NA07439 (based on *27 with c.19153 C>T). Furthermore, novel major star-alleles formed by combining variations from two different alleles were observed: in the case of CYP4F2, variations from *2 and *3 allele formed a novel CYP4F2*4 allele, and for the DPYD gene, a novel allele was formed by variations from both *5 and *9 alleles.",
                                "In many samples, it was observed that sub-alleles detected by the genotyping methods presented and described herein are not present in the known databases.",
                                "A similar observation was made by Raimundo, S. et al. ((2010) Pharmacogenetics 10(7):577-581) regarding the CYP2D6*2 family of sub-alleles. For example, c.843 T>G, associated with all recently discovered *4 sub-alleles (e.g. *4M, *4N and *4P), is not associated with *4 alleles (e.g. *4A, *4B etc.) discovered earlier. However, multiple samples were identified by the present methods, where the evidence indicates that *4A allele contains this SNP. This indicates either the incomplete characterization of *4A sub-allele, or the presence of novel *4 sub-alleles.",
                                "The lack of non-functional SNPs can affect the accurate genotype interpretation of HTS-based tools (as already reported by Twist, G. P., et al., (January 2016) npj Genomic Medicine 1:15007). As demonstrated herein, the genotyping methods described herein are capable of identifying additional sub-alleles that can be added to existing databases.",
                                "Specialized HTS platforms, such are PGRNseq, are removing the last obstacles preventing the wider integration of HTS technologies in everyday clinical settings. Coupled with fast and accurate genotyping frameworks, such as the ADME genotyping methods describe herein, these platforms can assist physicians in tailoring the prescription recommendations based on a patient's genetic makeup and lead to improved medical care.",
