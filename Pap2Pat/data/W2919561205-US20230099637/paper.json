    "abstract": "IGF1R and CD44 are overexpressed in most advanced melanomas so we designed chemotherapeutic nanoparticles to target those receptors. Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Tris DBA-Pd) is a novel inhibitor of N -myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT-1) and has proven in vivo activity against melanoma. However, poor solubility impairs its effectiveness. To improve its therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance in advanced melanomas, we synthesized Tris DBA-Pd hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (Tris DBA-Pd HANP) and evaluated them against in vivo xenografts of LM36R, an aggressive BRAF mutant human melanoma resistant to BRAF inhibitors. We treated xenografted mice in four arms: empty HANPs, free Tris DBA-Pd, Tris DBA-Pd HANPs, and Tris DBA-Pd HANPs with IGF1R antibody. The Tris DBA-Pd HANP group was the most responsive to treatment and showed the greatest depletion of CD44-positive cells on IHC. Surprisingly, the HANP containing IGF1R antibody was less effective than particles without antibody, possibly due to steric hindrance of IGF1R and CD44 binding. Tris DBA-Pd nanoparticles are an effective therapy for CD44-positive tumors like melanoma, and further development of these nanoparticles should be pursued.",

                "Metastatic melanoma remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapy, survival is still dismal. Immunotherapy has yielded long-term survival in 15\u201325% of patients in advanced melanoma, depending on the study, and side effects of immunotherapy are considerable, including debilitating colitis and new onset diabetes1\u20133. Targeted therapy has been limited to BRAF mutant melanoma, and even dual MEK/BRAF blockade leads to efficacy only for short periods of time, likely due to activation of alternative signaling pathways. Melanomas persistent post-BRAF blockade are often highly aggressive, and there is no targeted therapy against NRAS melanoma, triple negative melanoma, ocular melanoma and other subtypes4,5. Thus, novel therapies are needed.",
                "Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Tris DBA-Pd) is a novel organometallic compound originally developed as a catalyst in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. We were the first to demonstrate biological activity for this chemical catalyst, and demonstrated that it has activity against the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1), which catalyzes myristoylation of proteins, including c-src, allowing membrane localization and attenuates MAP kinase, AKT, and STAT3 signaling6,7. Tris DBA-Pd has been shown to be efficacious not only against melanoma, but preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma as well8\u201310. Thus, this compound might have therapeutic benefit against a variety of cancers, and not limited to those with a specific mutation.",
                "An obstacle to the clinical development of this compound is its poor solubility. Nanoparticles offer novel methods of delivery of compounds that are otherwise difficult to deliver11. In order to overcome this obstacle, we decided to incorporate the drug into targeted hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles to target LM36R, a well-established human melanoma xenograft model of BRAF resistance12,13.",
                "We examined two potential targets for our drug payload, CD44 and IGFR1 which are both implicated in the progression of metastatic melanoma. As stated before, hyaluronic acid targets its receptor, CD44, which is expressed on melanoma stem cells and on aggressive tumor cells from multiple different types of tumors. IGF1R has been found to be upregulated in melanoma cells and is thought to be involved in numerous pathways that regulate cell survival and proliferation14. Studies show treatment with anti-IGF1R antibody is able to reduce tumor growth in uveal melanoma, revealing its value as a potential target for novel chemotherapeutic agents15. With these two targets in mind, we hypothesized that nanoparticles synthesized with hyaluronic acid would also carry the Tris DBA-Pd payload to cells that express CD44 surface receptors, especially those cells which overexpress CD44 and IGF1R such as metastatic melanoma."

                        "To improve the tumor targetability and increase the tumor treatment effects of Tris DBA-Pd, we first synthesized hyaluronic acid nanoparticles (HANP), which is composed of a hydrophilic outer layer of HA and a hydrophobic inner cavity. HANPs were prepared by High Pressure Homogenizer (PhD Technology International LLC, USA). First, hyaluronic acid (HA) was conjugated with 5\u03b2-cholanic acid (CA) in the presence of EDC and NHS as previously described by Zhang et al.11. Water-insoluble Tris DBA-Pd was physically encapsulated into the hydrophobic cavities by a high-pressure homogenizer. This allowed for the dispersion of Tris DBA-Pd under physiological conditions. After freeze-drying, 40\u2009mg of HANPs were dispersed in 8\u2009mL of distilled water and 10\u2009mg of Tris DBA-Pd was dissolved in 2\u2009mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The Tris DBA-Pd solution was slowly added into the HANP in high pressure homogenizer and homogenized for 5\u2009min. Finally, the resulting mixture was dialyzed for 4\u2009hours against an excess amount of distilled water to remove unloaded drugs and organic solvent, followed by lyophilization. Compared to free Tris DBA-Pd that immediately precipitated in water, FBS, and cell culture media, Tris DBA-Pd HANP presented good dispersion in these buffers. The results indicated that Tris DBA-Pd was loaded into the interior of the HANP successfully to form Tris DBA-Pd HANPs with excellent solubility and stability in physiological buffers. To verify the encapsulation of Tris DBA-Pd, we compared the size changes before and after loading. Particles synthesized with Tris DBA-Pd revealed a 20\u2009nm increase in average diameter, which is attributed to the encapsulation of Tris DBA-Pd inside the HANPs (Fig.\u00a02). The DBA encapsulation was further verified and calculated by HPLC (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01).",

The most recent immunotherapies result in a 15\u201325% long term survival, but at significant morbidity from autoimmune disease1,2,27,28. Despite extensive research, we have no effective biomarkers to discover which populations would benefit from this relatively toxic therapy. Retrospective studies have demonstrated some differences in responders vs non-responders, but have not been tested in large-scale studies23. Additional therapies have included targeted treatments against BRAF and MEK, which have resulted in dramatic short-term responses but relatively few long-term responses. This is likely due to activation of alternate pathways, considering that MEK activation alone in immortalized melanocytes yields slow growing, nonaggressive melanomas in vivo29. No targeted therapies are currently available for melanoma that does not contain BRAF mutations or melanomas that have become resistant to BRAF inhibitors. We assessed the efficacy of Tris DBA-Pd nanoparticles against LM36R, a highly aggressive human melanoma xenograft, which is BRAF mutant and resistant to the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib13.",

While it is effective in submicromolar concentrations6, the optimal delivery method has not yet been developed. Previous studies have used suspensions in oil or Intralipid6,8. While these studies provide proof of principle of the efficacy of Tris DBA-Pd in vivo, optimization of delivery is required. In this study, we incorporated Tris DBA-Pd into hyaluronic acid containing nanoparticles, either containing IGF-1 to target IGF1R expressing melanomas, or hyaluronic acid particles not containing IGF-1. Of interest, hyaluronic acid itself targets CD44, a cell surface marker associated with highly malignant behavior in many solid malignancies30\u201332.",

In vivo analysis of treated tumors reveals intriguing targets. The transcription factor Egr-1 is upregulated by HANP Tris DBA and upregulation of Egr-1 confers radiation sensitivity upon melanoma33. Of interest, one of the most upregulated genes in the Tris DBA-Pd HANP arm is IGHD, an immune marker which has been noted to be upregulated in melanomas that are responsive to ipilimumab23. HMCN1 is also induced by Tris DBA HANP and high-level expression of this molecule is associated with improved prognosis in human melanoma. SCG2 (secretogranin 2) is downregulated by both free tris DBA and Tris DBA HANP, and low expression of SCG2 is associated with improved prognosis in human melanoma. Secretogranin 2 encodes a precursor for secretoneurin, which promotes migration of melanoma cells34.",
                "Our results suggest several important therapeutically relevant findings. First, there is no overlap between resistance to BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib) and Tris DBA-Pd. Second, Tris DBA-Pd can be effectively packaged in hyaluronic acid containing nanoparticles. While free Tris DBA showed efficacy in this model, the physical characteristics of free Tris DBA, namely the variability in particle size, might preclude development of the free compound as an intravenous formulation. The nanoparticle formulation allows uniform particle preparation, which would be required for human studies by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is important because hyaluronic acid is a well-studied material in humans with minimal toxicity and is relatively inexpensive compared with other nanoparticle vehicles11. Third, by targeting a pathway and not a particular mutation, we can expand the indication of this drug to a wide variety of tumors. Finally, more is not necessarily better, as the Tris DBA-Pd particles with hyaluronic acid alone was superior to that of the particles containing antibody to IGF1R and hyaluronic acid. One possibility is that targeting both IGF1R (IGF-1) and CD44 (hyaluronic acid) may cause competition or steric hindrance. There is also a possibility that these nanoparticles are reaching other cells containing IGF1R thus diverting its antitumorigenic effects. These factors should be taken into account when designing future nanoparticles."
