                        "Computed tomography (CT) allows visualization and quantification of anatomical and pathological structures with fine spatial/contrast resolution and cost-effectiveness for screening, diagnosis, and therapeutic planning. In clinical CT, the energy spectrum of an x-ray source is polychromatic, and x-ray signals are detected in the current-integrating mode. This physical process is accurately described by an energy-dependent non-linear integral model on the basis of the Beer-Lambert law. The non-linear imaging model is not invertible with an exact analytic solution, and is often approximated as a linear integral model in the form of the Radon transform, basically discarding x-ray energy-dependent information. This model mismatch may generate inaccurate quantification of attenuation image. Because lower energy photons are more easily attenuated than higher energy photons, x-rays spectra may be different at a specific location for different passing ray paths inside the object. Thus the attenuation may be different at the specific location for distinct passing paths, resulting in nonlinear characteristics of the x-rays attenuation. Therefore, the attenuation coefficient reconstructed from the linear integral model in clinical CT may deviate from the true physical quantity of x-ray attenuation, inducing significant beam-hardening artifacts in the image reconstruction.",
                        "A linearization technique based on a single material (water for medical CT) correction may transform the measured polychromatic projection data into corresponding monochromatic data via a polynomial correction model. Since water correction ignores the presence of high-density materials, such as bone, it fails to correct the cupping and streak artifacts caused by multiple high-density materials inside the scanned field of view. Single material correction may be extended to the case of multiple material objects using an iterative post reconstruction (IPR) approach. From a preliminary reconstruction, the IPR techniques are configured to estimate the intersection length of each material along every x-ray ray path using image segmentation techniques. Then, a sinogram can be better corrected from material thicknesses and prior knowledge about materials composition and corresponding x-ray spectral information based on the polychromatic x-ray physical model. These single material techniques illustrate feasibility of the x-ray monochromatic imaging using an ordinary x-ray CT scanner. However, the IPR techniques involve a relatively complicated image segmentation procedure, and information of tissue structure and composition, which are not available in medical imaging cases. The beam hardening correction is relatively sensitive to the segmentation accuracy."

The network is formed by connecting the output of selected nodes to the input of other nodes to form a directed, weighted graph. The weights as well as the functions that compute the activation can be modified by learning (e.g., training).",

A relationship between the input and the output may be linear or non-linear. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep, feed-forward ANN, that includes one or more convolutional layers with fully connected layers on top. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of feed-forward ANN that includes at least three layers of nodes and each node, except for the input nodes, uses a nonlinear activation function. An MLP may be trained using back propagation, a supervised learning technique. The multiple layers and non-linear activation of an MLP distinguish it from a linear perceptron.

Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. Deep learning techniques learn in supervised (e.g., classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) manners. Deep learning algorithms learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction. In other words, deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned.",

For example, convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques may be utilized for image denoising in low-dose CT. The deep learning CT denoising methods may be configured to learn a function between a low-dose image patch and the corresponding patch of high quality from a large training data set. After this training process, CNN is used to transform a low-dose CT image to a relatively higher quality counterpart. In another example, deep learning for image reconstruction may be utilized to enhance image quality. The deep learning method may be configured to learn a regularization transformation and parameters from big data for iterative reconstruction, complying with natural structures of medical images. In another example, a deep residual network may be configured to suppress artifacts for limited-angle CT image reconstruction.",
                        "Generally, the present disclosure relates to a machine learning-based image reconstruction method configured to reduce or eliminate beam-hardening artifacts in a reconstructed CT image. A neural network is configured to learn a nonlinear transform from a training data set to map CT images reconstructed from a single current-integrating data set to monochromatic projections at a pre-specified energy level, realizing monochromatic imaging and overcoming beam hardening effectively on a common clinic CT scanner without any dual-energy function. Machine learning has been successful in image classification, identification, segmentation, and super resolution. For example, convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques may be applied for image denoising in low-dose CT. To train the neural network, the training data can be obtained from a state of the art dual-energy CT scanner, such as Revolution CT with source kVp-switching (available from General Electric Company (GE)), IQon Spectral CT with double-layer detection (available from Philips, N.V.), and Somatom Force CT with dual-source gantry (available from Siemens, A.G.), that may be available in clinical practice to generate dual-energy data sets. In the diagnostic energy range, the x-ray energy-dependent attenuation process can be approximated as a combination of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. A dual-energy CT scan generates two projection data sets with two distinct x-ray energy spectra, which can be used to reconstruct photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering components for synthesis of monochromatic projection data sets. To ensure accuracy, uniqueness and stability of the neural network model, the training data set should have a sufficiently high quality and quantity of images with well-diversified features.",
                        "One nonlimiting example application of x-ray monochromatic imaging is for proton therapy treatment planning. To improve the prognosis of a patient, proton therapy may be configured to deliver a highly-focused radiation dose to a tumor at the Bragg peak whose position is determined by stopping power ratio (SPR) relative to water along the beam path. A treatment planning activity may include operating an ordinary CT scanner with a single-spectrum current-integrating data set using a stoichiometric calibration method to establish a one-to-one relationship between CT numbers and SPRs for biological tissue. The calibration method may be susceptible to variations of tissue composition. Inaccurate CT numbers induced from beam-hardening artifacts may compromise the radiation dose distribution over a cancerous region. With machine learning-based monochromatic imaging, as described herein, the electron density and effective atomic number of matter composition can be extracted for accurate computation of SPR. Thus, the proton therapy treatment planning can be implemented on an ordinary CT scanner for superior diagnostic and therapeutic performance, reducing system complexity, radiation dose, and planning cost compared with the use of dual-energy CT.",
                        "Generally, this disclosure relates to monochromatic CT image reconstruction from current-integrating data via machine learning. An apparatus, method and/or system are configured to determine, by a trained artificial neural network (ANN), a monochromatic projection data set based, at least in part, on a measured CT image. The measured CT image may be reconstructed based, at least in part, on measured projection data. The measured projection data may be polychromatic. The apparatus, method and/or system may be further configured to reconstruct a monochromatic CT image based, at least in part, on the monochromatic projection data set.

                        "Thus, a deep-learning-based image reconstruction technique may be utilized for monochromatic CT imaging when an x-ray source is polychromatic, and an x-ray detector is in the current-integrating mode. A nonlinear map (e.g., trained multilayer perceptron) may be determined between directly measured data and idealized line integrals (i.e., monochromatic projection data) through data-driven optimization. Due to big data based learning, the nonlinear mapping is configured to avoid the beam-hardening mechanism. Thus, the inverse Radon transform, such as filtered back projection (FBP), can be applied for monochromatic image reconstruction with relatively high accuracy. A system, method and/or apparatus, consistent with the present disclosure may be utilized for biomedical imaging, nondestructive testing, security screening, and/or other applications.",
