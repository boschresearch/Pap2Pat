Data derived from sensors or other measurement devices such as ECG sensors can be used to generate biomarkers. The biomarkers can then be used to generate an acute hypotension prediction classifier, or monitored factor, derived from a three dimensional temporal representation of two or more biomarkers. When the monitored factor exceeds a predetermined threshold the method and system trigger an alarm before an appearance of a hypotensive episode in the patient.",

                        "Acute hypotensive episodes (AHEs) are one of the most critical events that generally occur in intensive care units (ICUs). An acute hypotensive episode is a clinical condition typically characterized by abnormally low blood pressure values and other related values. For example, an acute hypotensive episode may occur in an interval of from 5 minutes up to 30 minutes or more during which at least 90% of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements of a patient are at or below 70 mmHg. According to the other definition of acute hypotensive episode it appears when systolic value of arterial blood pressure (ABP) drops below 90 mmHg. Acute hypotensive episodes may occur due to a large number of causes. The causes of acute hypotensive episodes, among others, may include sepsis, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage, dehydration, anaphylaxis, medication, vasodilatory shock, or any of a wide variety of other causes. Often it may be crucial to determine the causes of the acute hypotensive episodes in order to administer appropriate patients' treatment before hypotensive episode. However, when the acute hypotensive episodes are not predicted in time, the practitioners are left with insufficient time to determine the causes of the acute hypotensive episodes and to start patient specific treatment. Also, due to insufficient time appropriate treatment may not be administered. If an acute hypotensive episode is not promptly and appropriately treated, it may result in an irreversible organ damage and, eventually death."

FIG. 1 is a general block diagram of one embodiment of the inventive system. FIG. 1 shows a patient (1) and 10 electrodes, or sensors (2-11) attached to the patient for transmitting ECG signals to the ECG device (12). The ECG device is preferably a high resolution ECG device having a processor (12a), software (12b) and storage (12c). The processor and software are capable of making calculations using data generated by measuring devices attached to patient that measure biological outputs such as processing and analyzing ECG or respiratory signals(15). The ECG device could also be connected to a personal computer (13) that includes a processor, software and storage (13a) capable of processing and analyzing the ECG signals in order to predict a hypotensive event. The system also includes storage (12a or 13a) for storing threshold alarm values that can be compared to processed data. The system also includes an alarm (14) which activates before a hypotensive event occurs and gives a warning signal to the caregivers when the system predicts an upcoming hypotensive event. The advance warning signal gives caregivers the opportunity to take corrective or remedial action with the patient before the hypotensive event occurs in order to avoid pathophysiological consequences and unfavorable outcome of patient after hypotensive event. The system also has the ability to receive other signals from other devices that generate data of physiological measurements that can be used to calculate hypotension prediction specific biomarkers.

A rapid, accurate, sensitive and specific prediction of the potential acute hypotensive episodes may provide adequate time to diagnose the cause of the potential acute hypotensive episodes in the patients. Therefore, the prediction of the acute hypotensive episodes may improve possibilities of determination of the kind of intervention or treatment required to prevent the patients from the potential acute hypotensive episodes.

                        "FIG. 21 is a Receiver Operation Characteristic (ROC) curve generated from cardiologic patients validating and confirming the reliability of the invention method and device. The inventive method and system (FIG. 1) has been prospectively validated on 60 patients of cardiological intensive care units of three independent cardiological clinics. Patients with and without hypotensive episodes were included into prospective clinical study. ROC analysis has been used for estimation of sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) of hypotension episode prediction system. FIG. 21 shows the ROC curve of the clinically validated system using the most reliable monitoring factor \u0394E1. The ROC curve confirms that the inventive hypotension episode prediction method and apparatus predicthypotensive episodes with very high and clinically acceptable sensitivity at 85% and specificity at 92%. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is also high at 94%. Sensitivity, specificity and AUC values all confirm that invented system solves the problem of reliable prediction of hypotensive episodes and that it can be widely used in clinical practice",
