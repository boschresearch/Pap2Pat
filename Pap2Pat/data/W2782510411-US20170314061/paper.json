    "title": "Click beetle luciferase mutant and near infrared naphthyl-luciferins for improved bioluminescence imaging",
    "date": "2018-01-09",
    "abstract": "The sensitivity of bioluminescence imaging in animals is primarily dependent on the amount of photons emitted by the luciferase enzyme at wavelengths greater than 620 nm where tissue penetration is high. This area of work has been dominated by firefly luciferase and its substrate, D -luciferin, due to the system\u2019s peak emission (~ 600 nm), high signal to noise ratio, and generally favorable biodistribution of D -luciferin in mice. Here we report on the development of a codon optimized mutant of click beetle red luciferase that produces substantially more light output than firefly luciferase when the two enzymes are compared in transplanted cells within the skin of black fur mice or in deep brain. The mutant enzyme utilizes two new naphthyl-luciferin substrates to produce near infrared emission (730 nm and 743 nm). The stable luminescence signal and near infrared emission enable unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy for performing deep tissue multispectral tomography in mice.",

                "Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using firefly luciferase (Luc2) and D-luciferin (D-LH2) has become a standard method for gene expression analysis and preclinical evaluation of potential therapies in mouse models1, 2. The Luc2/D-LH2 system has been broadly adopted because the light it produces peaks near 600\u2009nm at 37\u2009\u00b0C and can adequately penetrate shallow tissues such as skin. However, in deeper tissues such as lung, brain, and bone, the sensitivity of Luc2/D-LH2 is limited due to absorption by hemoglobin, melanin, and other tissue components3, 4. In addition, the biodistribution of D-LH2 is often insufficient for sustained imaging in challenging tissues, such as brain5.",
                "To improve resolution for deep tissue imaging, attempts have been made to shift the wavelength of bioluminescence emission into the near infrared (NIR) (650\u2012900\u2009nm). Mutagenesis has been used successfully to red-shift the spectral properties of luciferases (utilizing D-LH2 as substrate), but mutants with a significant NIR component to their emission have been elusive6, 7. This is likely an inherent limitation of the actual photon-emitting species, oxyluciferin6, 8\u201310.",
                "Analogs of D-LH2 with extended \u03c0 conjugation to support longer wavelength photon generation have been developed that produce NIR bioluminescence with Luc211\u201314, and aminoluciferin-NIR dye conjugates have been shown to produce NIR signals via energy transfer15. Kuchimaru et al. recently described a new substrate, AkaLumine-HCl (Aka-HCl), that contains extended conjugation and produces NIR bioluminescence (677\u2009nm peak emission)16. However, the utility of these substrates is still limited due to the fact that bioluminescence signals are only enhanced over Luc2/D-LH2 at limited substrate concentrations.",
                "We addressed the challenges associated with deep tissue imaging by creating improved substrates and luciferases. We designed two naphthyl-based luciferin analogs, amino-naphthyl naphtho[2,1]thiazole luciferin (NH2-NpLH2) and hydroxy-naphtha[2,1]thiazole luciferin (OH-NpLH2), and evaluated these substrates using several beetle luciferase enzymes to find the most compatible pairing. Both substrates produced NIR bioluminescence with click beetle red luciferase (CBR)17, but signals were weak compared to Luc2/D-LH2. To improve luminescence intensity we used rational enzyme design and codon optimization to engineer a mutant luciferase, CBR2, encoded by a codon-optimized gene sequence, CBR2opt. In cells the mutant produced significantly more signal with the OH-NpLH2 substrate compared to CBR. Although light output with NH2-NpLH2 (the brighter of the two analogs) was essentially unchanged, the emission spectrum shifted dramatically (~\u200965\u2009nm) into the NIR (730\u2009nm peak). In addition to providing improved signal for OH-NpLH2 and a red-shift for NH2-NpLH2, the CBR2 enzyme was also more stable in live cells compared to Luc2. This suggested that it could provide greater light output by accumulating to higher levels when expressed in animals.",
                "Herein, we demonstrate that the mutant click beetle luciferase and NH2-NpLH2 each represent significant advancements for in vivo BLI. The mutant maintains the ability to utilize D-LH2 as a substrate, and this pairing provides improved sensitivity in mice compared to Luc2/D-LH2. Further, when testing for deep tissue multispectral tomography, the pairing of the mutant enzyme with NH2-NpLH2 produces highly resolved NIR signals which enable a precise 3D diffuse tomographic reconstruction for localization of cells in the brain using NIR emission filters."

                        "It was previously demonstrated that extension of \u03c0 conjugation in luciferin analogs reduces the HOMO-LUMO energy gap in corresponding oxyluciferins to result in a red-shifted spectrum11\u201314. We envisioned that the fusion of an additional phenyl ring to the benzothiazole fragment of LH2 could increase conjugation and create a substrate capable of producing longer wavelength light. Compounds with extended conjugation arising from unsubstituted polyolefins (e.g., cyanine dyes) are often prone to chemical and photo-instability18. To extend the conjugation of our luciferin we turned to naphthothiazole-based analogs rather than luciferin analogs that have additional alkene units between the aryl and thiazoline moieties (e.g., Aka-HCl). We identified NH2-NpLH2 and OH-NpLH2 (Fig.\u00a01a) as candidates for the production of NIR bioluminescence with an optimized luciferase. These analogs were conveniently synthesized using conventional luciferin chemistry with high enantiopurity (see Supplementary Figs.\u00a01\u20133, Supplementary Table\u00a01). The monopotassium salt forms of NH2-NpLH2 and OH-NpLH2 were also formulated and found to have good aqueous solubility (NH2-NpLH2, 46\u2009mM; OH-NpLH2, 50\u2009mM) and stability at ambient temperature in PBS for at least 24\u2009h. In addition, neither compound was cytotoxic (HEK-293, Hela) or showed any acute toxicity or adverse effects in mice when administered intraperitoneally at high concentration19.Fig. 1Biochemical and preliminary cell-based characterization of naphthyl-luciferin bioluminescence substrates and different luciferases. a Chemical structures of NH2-NpLH2, OH-NpLH2, and D-LH2.

Peak values for CBR are reported in Table\u00a01. For CBR2 the peak values are as follows: D-LH2, 614\u2009nm; NH2-NpLH2, 730\u2009nm; OH-NpLH2, 743\u2009nm.

Attempts to collect spectra for OH-NpLH2 were also unsuccessful due to insufficient signal. Error bars represent standard deviation (S.D.)",
                        "NH2-NpLH2 and OH-NpLH2 were tested as substrates with Luc2, click beetle green (CBG99)17, CBR, and UltraGlo20. Each enzyme displayed a range of spectral properties and bioluminescence intensities (Table\u00a01). NH2-NpLH2 was utilized by all of the enzymes tested, and Luc2, CBR, and UltraGlo each produced spectral emission peaks in the NIR (~\u2009655\u2012720\u2009nm). In contrast, OH-NpLH2 was only utilized by CBR and UltraGlo. Spectral data were elucidated for OH-NpLH2, but only under conditions of high enzyme concentration. CBR and UltraGlo both gave significant emission in the NIR with this substrate. However, the peak for OH-NpLH2 with CBR is particularly striking (758\u2009nm), as it is 52\u2009nm longer than what was previously reported as the most red-shifted bioluminescence system to date13. Although both naphthyl-luciferin substrates produced NIR emission, signal intensities were generally much lower (~5000\u2012500,000-fold) than Luc2/D-LH2 (note reduced spectral sensitivity for longer wavelength photons contributed to the lower relative signals for the NIR analogs21 as measured using a PMT-based luminometer22). The exception was CBG99/NH2-NpLH2. This pair produced the highest signal using a luminometer, but had the shortest peak emission wavelength (544\u2009nm) of all combinations examined. CBR presented the best opportunity for achieving both high luminescence intensity and NIR emission and was therefore selected for optimization with the naphthyl-luciferin substrates as a means to develop an improved system for animal imaging.Table 1Substrate characteristicsEmission peaka (nm)Brightnessb (RLU)D-LH2NH2-NpLH2OH-NpLH2D-LH2NH2-NpLH2OH-NpLH2Luc2559678c, 719d*1.01\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u20135(\u2212)UltraGlo556555c, 667d6590.51\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221244\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126CBG99546544*1.02\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221222\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126CBR6146647580.22\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221243\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126* Could not be obtained due to low signal.

                        "To assist in the optimization of CBR for enhanced luminescence with the NIR substrates, we built a homology model of the enzyme (Fig.\u00a01b). The model was based on the X-ray structure of a related firefly luciferase with bound 5\u2032-O-[N-(dehydroluciferyl)-sulfamoyl] adenosine (DLSA)23 (PDB code 2D1S), but we replaced the dehydroluciferin moiety of DLSA with OH-NpLH2 (chosen because of its significant red-shift). Efficient light emission for beetle luciferases is thought to require a hydrogen acceptor for the 6\u2032-hydroxyl group of LH2 (Fig.\u00a01a), and the source for this is likely the conserved arginine (R334 in CBR) located at the base of the luciferin binding pocket. R334, which also participates in a stabilizing hydrogen-bonding network that helps shield luciferin from solvent, has been implicated in modulating the level of light output from 6\u2032-substituted aminoluciferins24. Together these observations indicated R334 was a suitable target for mutagenesis.",
                        "Based on our analysis of the CBR model, we targeted two nearby active site residues in combination, R334 and the directly opposing G351 (Fig.\u00a01b). We hypothesized that replacement of these residues with different combinations of hydrogen acceptors and donors could improve enzyme efficiency by restructuring the hydrogen-bond network to better accommodate the new substrates. Furthermore, mutagenesis at these sites offered the potential to provide an alternate\u00a0hydrogen-bond acceptor for OH-NpLH2. To test our hypothesis, we constructed a library of mutational combinations at positions 334 (E, Q, D, N, H, S, T, C, Y) and 351 (R, K, E). The library was expressed in bacteria and screened as lysates for improved light output using each NIR substrate. The mutant enzyme of highest interest, R334S+G351R (CBR2), was purified and further characterized. Subsequently, the gene sequence for CBR2 was optimized (CBR2opt; 79% identity to CBR2) to match codon frequencies as found in mice (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a04)."

Surprisingly, the peak emission for CBR2/NH2-NpLH2 was shifted by more than 65\u2009nm (to 730\u2009nm).

Briefly, the specific activities for CBR and CBR2 utilizing D-LH2 as substrate were 5- and 7.5-fold lower than that of Luc2, and their affinities for D-LH2 were 10- and 22-fold weaker. In contrast, CBR and CBR2 had 30- and 44-fold higher affinity for NH2-NpLH2 compared to D-LH2. Although D-LH2 utilization differed significantly between enzymes, affinities for ATP were similar. While it was possible to obtain a measurable signal for Luc2/NH2-NpLH2, Luc2/OH-NpLH2, CBR/OH-NpLH2, and CBR2/OH-NpLH2 using a large excess of enzyme, accurate kinetic parameters could not be determined due to rapid signal decay and low signal to background under these conditions.Table 2Kinetic parameters for beetle luciferases and substratesBrightnessa (RLUmax \u00b5M\u22121)Km (\u00b5M)D-LH2NH2-NpLH2D-LH2NH2-NpLH2ATP (saturating D-LH2)ATP (saturating NH2-NpLH2)Luc23\u2009\u00d7\u2009109*1*286*CBR6\u2009\u00d7\u20091086\u2009\u00d7\u2009105100.3159132CBR24\u2009\u00d7\u20091088\u2009\u00d7\u2009104220.5305112* Value could not be determined because of insufficient signal above background at low substrate concentrationsa Brightness (RLUmax \u00b5M\u22121 enzyme) and Km calculated from substrate titrations using Michaelis\u2013Menten regression analysis; n\u2009=\u20093.

                        "Although in a biochemical setting Luc2/D-LH2 was brighter than both CBR and CBR2, this was not the case in live cells at 37\u2009\u00b0C. CBR, CBR2, and CBR2opt (mammalian codon optimized version of CBR2; encodes the same CBR2 enzyme sequence) each produced an enzyme capable of generating 2\u20123-fold more luminescence with D-LH2 compared to Luc2 in HEK-293 cells (Fig.\u00a01d). This was likely a result of higher accumulation of enzyme in cells contributed by greater physical stability at 37\u2009\u00b0C for the CBR and CBR2 enzymes (t1/2\u2009>\u200910\u2009h) compared to Luc2 (t1/2\u2009<\u200930\u2009min) (Fig.\u00a01e). The difference in brightness between Luc2/D-LH2 and CBR2/NH2-NpLH2 with purified enzyme at ambient temperature was nearly 10,000-fold (Tables\u00a01 and 2). However, when expressed in cells the difference in signal between CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 and Luc2/D-LH2 narrowed to only 33-fold. For CBR/CBR2/CBR2opt this was likely due to improved expression and stability at elevated temperature. As observed previously (Table\u00a01), there was no detectable signal for Luc2/OH-NpLH2. The calculated Km values for all three substrates were higher in cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05), but relative affinities were consistent with the biochemical data.",
                        "We also measured bioluminescence spectra in cells that expressed either CBR2opt or Luc2 (Fig.\u00a01f). At 37\u2009\u00b0C the signal for cells treated with OH-NpLH2 was too low to collect accurate spectra, as was the signal for Luc2 cells treated with NH2-NpLH2. CBR2opt expressing cells produced emission peaks of 617\u2009nm and 728\u2009nm with D-LH2 and NH2-NpLH2, respectively. This is in agreement with the data generated using purified enzyme (Fig.\u00a01c). Note the emission peak for Luc2/D-LH2 under these conditions (i.e., in cells at 37\u2009\u00b0C) was red-shifted to 608\u2009nm, a value consistent with previous reports25.",

The ratio of the signals produced from each condition was calculated as a means to assess relative permeability. The intact/lysed ratio was greater than 10-fold higher for NH2-NpLH2 than for D-LH2, which suggests the new substrate permeates HEK-293 cell membranes more efficiently than D-LH2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). To determine if the method of lysis contributed to the results, we examined both digitonin and Passive Lysis Buffer (PLB). Similar results were obtained regardless of the lytic procedure used."

It is likely that the superior signal for CBR2opt/D-LH2 compared to Luc2/D-LH2 under these presumably substrate saturating conditions is the combined result of a more stable enzyme and a greater proportion of light being generated\u2009>\u2009650\u2009nm.Fig. 3Imaging the backs of C57BL/6 black fur mice. a Representative bioluminescence images of mice after subcutaneous implantation of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 of HEK-EF1-Luc2-T2A-copGFP and HEK-EF1-CBR2opt-T2A-copGFP cells and intraperitoneal injection (150\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) of either D-LH2 or NH2-NpLH2 (data presented as means (n\u2009=\u20093)\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D.). b Quantification of flux (photon/s) with an exposure time of 60\u2009s (***p\u2009<\u20090.001 compared to CBR2opt/D-LH2).

                        "It is worth noting that the signal from both enzymes when paired with NH2-NpLH2 was only ~\u20092-fold lower than Luc2/D-LH2. This difference is much less than that observed using enzymes or cells (Figs.\u00a01 and 2), which suggests that the NIR photons produced by NH2-NpLH2 are, as expected, less prone to absorption by the black fur compared to signals coming from D-LH2."

                        "Imaging transplanted cells deep inside the brain using standard Luc2/D-LH2 presents a challenge not only because of the distance to the surface, but also because of its dark color, high cellular and molecular density, and relatively inefficient biodistribution of D-LH2. The bioluminescence produced by Luc2/D-LH2 generally contains an insufficient amount of longer wavelength photons to efficiently penetrate brain tissue and escape animals without being absorbed. To determine if the longer wavelength properties associated with CBR2opt/D-LH2 and CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 could help overcome this limitation, we implanted 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CBR2opt or Luc2 cells (stable HEK-293 lines) at 3\u2009mm depth in mouse brains and imaged after intravenous administration of 300\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 of D-LH2 or 220\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 of NH2-NpLH2 (Fig.\u00a04a, b). The higher concentration for D-LH2 was chosen because, although less common than the standard 150\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 dose, it was previously shown to produce higher signals in vivo29. Intravenous administration was chosen instead of intraperitoneal administration to ensure higher availability of substrate in the brain5. The dose of NH2-NpLH2 was chosen because it is close to the solubility limit in PBS. The bioluminescence signal from CBR2opt/D-LH2 was 2-fold higher than the signal from Luc2/D-LH2 (p value\u2009<\u20090.05; ONE-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey\u2019s t test; same test was performed throughout the text if not specified), and approximately 3-fold higher than the signal from CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 (p value\u2009<\u20090.01). These findings are consistent with our results showing the effectiveness of CBR2opt in the subcutaneous model (Fig.\u00a03).Fig. 4Comparison between CBR2opt and Luc2 utilizing either D-LH2 or Aka-HCl for imaging mouse brain. a Images of representative mice after intracranial implantation of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 HEK-EF1-Luc2-T2A-copGFP or HEK-EF1-CBR2opt-T2A-copGFP cells and intravenous injection of D-LH2 (300\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) or NH2-NpLH2 (220\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) (n\u2009=\u20094). b Quantification of photon flux (photon per s) with an exposure time of 30\u2009s at the peak of bioluminescence emission (4\u20137\u2009min after substrate injection) (*p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared to CBR2opt/D-LH2). c Images of representative mice after intracranial implantation of cells and intravenous injection of either D-LH2 (300\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) or Aka-HCl (50\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) (n\u2009=\u20093). d Quantification of flux (photon/s) with an exposure time of 30\u2009s (**p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared to CBR2opt/D-LH2).

                        "Using the brain model, we also compared CBR2opt/D-LH2 to CBR2opt and Luc2 with the NIR substrate, Aka-HCl (administered at its maximum solubility in PBS, 50\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121). CBR2opt/D-LH2 and Luc2/Aka-HCl produced essentially the same amount of signal (Fig.\u00a04c, d). CBR2opt/Aka-HCl generated 6-fold lower signal intensity compared to CBR2opt/D-LH2 and Luc2/Aka-HCl (p value\u00a0<\u20090.01), indicating that Aka-HCl is a relatively poor substrate for CBR2opt."

We compared CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 to the brightest D-luciferin based system to date, CBR2/D-LH2, for bioluminescence tomography using the brain model. The experiments were performed with intraperitoneal injection of substrates as a means to generate a stable light emission. The sustained signal allowed for the collection of photons over time using a series of band pass filters. The resulting images were then used to reconstruct the light source using an algorithm developed by Living Image 4.3 software. We co-registered CT images of mice with BLT images to determine the sagittal depth of the light source from the edge of the skull. As shown in Fig.\u00a05, it was possible to determine the depth of cell implantation on day one with no statistically significant differences between CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 (sagittal depth 3.0\u2009mm\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009mm; n\u2009=\u20093) and CBR2/D-LH2 (sagittal depth 3.2\u2009mm\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009mm; n\u2009=\u20093).

As shown in Fig.\u00a06a, reconstruction using CBR2/D-LH2 showed only a single larger spot, whereas CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 reconstruction allowed us to locate two distinct signals in the brain (Fig.\u00a06b). Histological analysis of coronal brain sections revealed the presence of copGFP positive cells located in both of the ventricular areas (calculated distance of ~\u20091\u2009mm), and confirmed the accuracy of reconstruction using CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 (Fig.\u00a06c).Fig. 5Bioluminescence tomography in mouse brain showing the location of the bioluminescence signal in mouse brain at day 1 after transplantation of cells.

                "In this study we report the design and characterization of two naphthyl-based luciferin analogs and the development of a mutant luciferase enzyme (CBR2) that can efficiently utilize these substrates to produce NIR bioluminescence. The amino compound (NH2-NpLH2; peak emission at 730\u2009nm) is of particular interest because of its demonstrated utility in mice. Prior to this report, the most red-shifted, in vivo-compatible bioluminescence system (without an energy transfer acceptor) was firefly luciferase combined with the substrate iLH2, which peaks at 706 nm13.",
                "Although longer wavelength signals are important for animal imaging, a luciferase/luciferin system must also produce ample photons for detection. In addition, substrates that are readily cell permeable are necessary for optimal biodistribution and sufficient production of luminescence16, 30. In consideration of these factors, we characterized cells expressing CBR2opt treated with D-LH2 and demonstrated that this combination produces higher photon flux compared to Luc2/D-LH2 and comparable flux to Luc2/Aka-HCl. The enhancement of CBR2opt over Luc2 (with D-LH2 as substrate) was likely a result of higher enzyme stability rather than enhanced catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the naphthyl-luciferin substrates retained their designed species specificity and were inefficient substrates for Luc2. Consequently, the naphthyl substrates (particularly NH2-NpLH2) have the potential to selectively detect CBR/CBR2 in multicolor orthogonal BLI applications with different enzyme/substrate pairs (e.g., Luc2/caged D-LH2)29, 31\u201335. In addition, we showed that NH2-NpLH2 has improved cell membrane permeability compared to D-LH2. Although encouraging, the cell-based results are not sufficient for the accurate prediction of in vivo behavior of a substrate, because parameters such as tissue biodistribution can significantly influence the sensitivity of bioluminescence systems.",
                "For this reason we selected two challenging models to test our system: imaging transplanted cells in the backs of black (non-shaved) mice, and imaging deeper regions of mouse brain. When equivalent amounts of substrates were injected intraperitoneally in black furred mice, CBR2opt/D-LH2 produced more signal compared to both Luc2/D-LH2 and CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2. For comparisons of enzymes and substrates in the brain, we selected the optimal concentration of each substrate for relevant benchmarking. Luc2/Aka-HCl was included in the brain experiments because this pairing was recently reported to provide improved sensitivity over Luc2/D-LH2 in mouse lung when low, equimolar concentrations of substrate were used16.",
                "While comparing substrates under these conditions is scientifically valid, it is arguably more relevant to benchmark each system using optimal conditions. At peak signal intensity, CBR2opt/D-LH2 and Luc2/Aka-HCl produced comparable signals in deep brain, and both were superior to Luc2/D-LH2 and CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2. This demonstrated that the total light emission and the optimization of imaging conditions and parameters play an important role in the ultimate sensitivity for BLI in vivo. For specific applications in brain that do not require the high resolution provided by NIR-emitting substrates, alternative D-luciferin analogs that produce increased signal have recently been described36.",
                "The reason CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 was not as sensitive as CBR2opt/D-LH2 or Luc2/Aka-HCl is likely that it did not produce as many photons\u2009>\u2009620\u2009nm. However, we achieved on average higher photon flux in vivo using CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 compared to a recently described NIR bioluminescence system based on intramolecular BRET (RLuc8-iRFP720 fusion)37. Note that CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 can potentially be combined for dual luciferase applications in vivo with a variety of BRET-based systems, e.g., iRFP720-Rluc8 and Antares (NLuc38, 39-CyOFP1 fusion)40, as these utilize coelenterazine-based substrates.",
                "Moreover, the NH2-NpLH2 substrate did provide improved BLI spatial resolution. This was likely a result of reduced signal scattering associated with the longer wavelength photons. To explore this possibility, we examined CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 in the brains of mice using BLT and compared to CBR2opt/D-LH2. Reconstruction of single light sources was not significantly different using the two substrates. However, we were able, for the first time, to visualize at high resolution the migration of cells using CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2. This enzyme/substrate combination facilitated the use of multispectral acquisitions that are required to perform bioluminescence source reconstruction41, 42. Although an absolute quantification of resolution and accuracy of BLT was beyond the purpose of this study, we believe that the CBR2opt/NH2-NpLH2 system can serve as a model for developing an improved algorithm for BLT42, 43.",
                "In summary, the engineered CBR2opt gene sequence in combination with D-LH2 or NH2-NpLH2 enabled both sensitive and highly resolved imaging in vivo. CBR2opt/D-LH2 is a practical choice for general imaging applications, as it provides high sensitivity and utilizes a well understood and readily available substrate. For more specialized applications, e.g., tomography, where high resolution is important, the combination of CBR2opt with NH2-NpLH2 is a valuable alternative. The versatility of this mutant enzyme paired with either D-LH2 or NH2-NpLH2 is of particular interest and may eventually lead to the broad use of these systems for a variety of BLI applications in the future."

The following conditions were used for imaging acquisition: exposure time 30\u2009s, binning \u00bcmedium: 8, field of view 12.9\u2009cm and f/stop 1. Band pass filters 580, 600, and 620\u2009nm were used for mice receiving D-LH2 and band pass filters 700, 720, and 740\u2009nm for mice receiving NH2-NpLH2. Mice were kept inside of an appropriate coil for subsequent CT scanning using a QuantumFX scanner (Perkin Elmer). Reconstruction of 3D bioluminescence and co-registration with CT images were performed using Living Image 4.5 software (PerkinElmer)."

Coronal sections of 20\u2009\u03bcm were placed in microscope glass slides, fixed with 1% PFA, washed and stained with DAPI for nuclear staining. After washing with PBS and addition of mounting media, cover glasses were section screened using a fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems). When cells were localized multiple brightfield images and copGFP fluorescence images were stitched together to reconstruct a partial brain structure."
