    "abstract": "A method of evaluating disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis with good sensitivity by a simple method, and a kit for use in the method. It provides a Jacalin-binding O-linked oligosaccharide epitope as a negative marker for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis, and enables more accurate assessment of disease condition by more objectively determining disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis using the amount of variation of a value obtained by multiplying the amount of MMP-3 in the blood or the amount of bound MMP-3 and ABA, ACA, or ACG in the blood by the reciprocal of the amount of bound MMP-3 and Jacalin in the blood. Through the discovery that an LEL or STL-reactive sugar chain on MMP-3 in the blood is a sugar chain marker for diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica and relapsing polychondritis, the present invention also provides a method for accurate diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica and relapsing polychondritis.",

                        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease with high frequency by which nearly 1% of the population is affected, and is a progressive and refractory inflammatory disease generating joint destruction along with the joint synovial proliferation. Synovitis occurs in the joints of the whole body, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and various proteases are secreted from proliferated synovial tissues, gradually articular cartilage and bones are affected, and as the affection progresses, the joints are destroyed and deformed. Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted from the chondrocytes or synovial cells activated by inflammatory cytokines are strongly involved in cartilage destruction, among them, MMP-3 (matrixmetalloproteinases-3) are produced in a large amount in synovial cells of rheumatoid arthritis, and are known to be strongly involved in the progress of cartilage destruction (Non-Patent Documents 1 to 3). Further, those inflammatory cytokines cause also bone destruction via activation of osteoclasts, and suppression of osteoblasts, and cause dysfunction due to the joint destruction, therefore, it is known that the activities of daily living (ADL) of a patient are remarkably lowered (Non-Patent Document 4).",
                        "For a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, a drug therapy with the use of in addition to a corticosteroid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), a biological agent (an anti-TNF receptor antagonist, an anti-IL-1\u03b2 antagonist, or an anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist) and the like, is performed. However, in any one of the drugs, the effect is largely different among the individuals, and there are some cases in which remission is not achieved even if multiple drugs are used.",
                        "In such a treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis, it is important to suppress the progress of joint destruction by restrain the disease at least low disease activity or lower with the early detection and the early treatment (Non-Patent Document 5).",
                        "However, clinical findings of rheumatoid arthritis are largely different among the individuals, there has been no specific test yet, and differentiation from other arthritis is also difficult, therefore, it is considered that specialized knowledge is required for the early diagnosis, and continuous medical consultation by a specialist is required, also in the determination of the therapeutic effect in a similar way (Non-Patent Document 6).",
                        "In order to quantify and evaluate the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis, various evaluation methods have been developed from the past, but accurate quantification is difficult. Among them, DAS (Disease Activity Score) developed as a technique for accurately quantitatively evaluating the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis is a method in which the tender joint count and the swollen joint count are examined, and taking the self-evaluation of the physical condition of a patient into account, the determination is performed by applying the results to special calculation formulas. DAS has become the mainstream as a method for evaluating disease activity in clinical research.",
                        "However, it is indispensable to consult a skilled doctor about 28 joints, and in addition to that, complicated calculation using square root and logarithms is required, therefore, a problem in which it takes time in routine practice, symptoms of ankle joints and toe joints are not reflected, and the like has been pointed out (Non-Patent Document 7). Even if it is evaluated as \u201cremission\u201d with \u201cDAS28\u201d, there may be a case where joint destruction progresses, therefore, it is required to apply separately to Boolean criteria, and criteria of SDAI and the like as the clinical remission criteria (Non-Patent Document 8).",
                        "Accordingly, it is desired to search for a rheumatoid arthritis marker that is simple, and capable of accurately evaluating rheumatoid arthritis without overlooking the serious disease activity of joint destruction, and to develop a new evaluation method using the rheumatoid arthritis marker, and the active research and development have been conducted.",
                        "For example, detection of myelin basic protein autoantibody, and myelin basic protein gene polymorphism (Patent Documents 1 and 2), detection of F1 domain or F3 domain of a novel polypeptide Talin (Patent Document 3), detection of leucine-rich \u03b12 glycoprotein (LRG) (Patent Document 4), detection of a novel protein Synoviolin that expresses highly in synovial cells and relates to abnormal proliferation of synovial cells, and the gene and the autoantibody of the Synoviolin (Patent Documents 5 to 8), detection of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GTP) and the gene thereof (Patent Document 9), measurement of the content of selenocysteine-containing proteins (Patent Document 10), detection of an anti-aldolase A antibody (Patent Document 11), diagnosis of type IX collagen destruction by an antibody detecting the cleavage position of the cleaved protein fragment of a type IX collagen \u03b1-1 chain (Patent Document 12), detection of an autoantibody by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (Patent Document 13), detection of a chronic rheumatoid arthritis patient-specific antibody by a clone A polypeptide that is a RA antigen, and a follistatin-related protein (FRP) (Patent Document 14), and the like have been proposed, and further detection of miRNA (miR124a), expression of which RA synovial cell-specifically increases or decreases (Patent Document 15) has also been proposed. Further, a method for differentiating osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis by an antibody detecting the selective splicing position and amount of tenascin C in joint fluid (Patent Document 16) has also been proposed. However, there is yet no disease activity evaluation system marker that has been practically used.",
                        "Among these rheumatoid arthritis markers, currently, an MMP-3 level in serum is attracting attention as the most reliable prognostic factor for joint destruction (Non-Patent Document 9), and is clinically also used for the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, the determination of therapeutic strategy, and the like. Serum CRP and serum ESR, which have been conventionally used as an inflammatory marker for diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, reflect systemic inflammation, in contrast, MMP-3 in serum is said to reflect the pathological condition of a local joint, and is exerted the effect of differentiating early RA from osteoarthritis, gout, traumatic arthropathy, and the like, which are difficult to be differentiated from early RA. On the other hand, the MMP-3 in serum shows a high level even in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) being a rheumatic disease as well, which is difficult to be differentiated from early RA, further shows a high level in various collagen diseases, kidney disease, and the like, therefore, cannot be said to have high specificity. Accordingly, in order to accurately diagnose rheumatoid arthritis, the MMP-3 in serum has to be used in combination with an inflammatory marker such as serum CRP (Non-Patent Document 10).",
                        "Research focusing on changes in glycan composition of a glycoprotein in serum is also active. Conventionally, there is a method in which a glycoprotein in serum, such as an immunoglobulin G glycoprotein is heat-denatured, and then the glycan is cut out, labeled and purified, and subjected to glycan analysis using high performance liquid chromatography by an ODS-silica column, subsequently diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is performed based on the changes in glycan profile from the samples of healthy subjects (Patent Document 17), but preparation of samples for analysis is complicated, and further there is a problem that the sensitivity is low. In recent years, focusing on a N-linked glycan secreted in serum, a diagnostic method based on the analysis using MS/MS spectrum has been proposed, in which the abundance of multiple N-linked glycans in which significant increase in the expression level is observed in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, in particular, the abundance of a glycan having a glycan profile of (Hex)3(HexNAc)3(Deoxyhexose)1(NeuAc)3+(Man)3(GlcNAc)2, and the abundance ratio of the structural isomers having different binding sites of a fucose (Deoxyhexose) of the glycan are used as a diagnostic marker for rheumatoid arthritis (Patent Document 18). However, most of these N-linked glycans are present also in the blood of healthy subjects, the characteristic increase of (Hex)3(HexNAc)3(Deoxyhexose)1(NeuAc)3+(Man)3(GlcNAc)2 is observed also in the deterioration in pathological conditions of viral hepatitis patients (for example, Nakagawa T et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry 281 (40) 29797-29806 (2006), and many others), therefore, there is a problem with clinical utility as a diagnostic marker for rheumatoid arthritis.",
                        "Many evaluation methods for accurately performing diagnosis and prognostic prediction of rheumatoid arthritis by combining multiple rheumatoid arthritis markers and applying to special calculation formulas to be scored have also been proposed. For example, a method in which the presence of rheumatoid arthritis is evaluated based on the first marker (SLC16A4) gene expression level information, and the second marker (SLCO2B1, PTPRM, SHB, or ATP9A) gene expression level information (Patent Document 19) has been proposed.",
                        "Recently, Crescendo Bioscience, Inc. in the United States has developed a technique in which diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis are performed by measuring 12 biomarkers including IL-6, EGF, VEGFA, LEP, SAA1, VCAM1, CRP, MMP-1, MMP-3, TNFRSF1A, RETN, and CHI3L1 in serum, and by using the disease activity index (DAI) scored by special calculation formulas (Patent Document 20, and Non-Patent Document 11). It can be said that the technique has high correlation with \u201cDAS28\u201d, and enables more accurate diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis without requiring any detailed diagnosis by a skilled doctor. However, a large amount of money is required for the measurement of as many as 12 biomarkers, and calculation by complicated calculation formulas is also required, therefore, the technique cannot be said to be a very practical technique in a clinical site.",
                        "Under these circumstances, it has been strongly desired to provide a novel rheumatoid arthritis biomarker, with which disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis can be accurately evaluated by simple measurement with as few biomarkers as possible without requiring any complicated calculation formulas.",
                        "In addition, particularly in the initial stage of onset, rheumatoid arthritis may exhibit symptoms similar to those in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) that is one of the rheumatic diseases (Non-Patent Document 12), and there are some cases in which discrimination between both is difficult. Accordingly, a technique for accurately discriminating between the rheumatoid arthritis and the polymyalgia rheumatica has been required.",
                        "On the other hand, among rheumatic diseases, relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an extremely rare disease, the symptom is characteristic, and it is known that there are active periods and inactive periods, in which the symptoms appear and disappear. Further, as a specific blood test method, there is a method of using an anti-collagen antibody, but the positive rate is not so high, and there is also a problem that positive appears even in rheumatoid arthritis (Non-Patent Document 13). Accordingly, it has been desired to provide an excellent marker and an excellent test method, with which accurate measurement can be performed regardless in the active period, or the inactive period."

                                "To solve the problems described above, in the intensive studies about a rheumatoid arthritis marker for a method for evaluating disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis, which can be applied in a clinical site, the present inventors have focused on MMP-3 in serum, which is considered to most reflect the pathological condition of local joints among various known markers, and detailed studies have been further added. As a result of which, the present inventors have found that there is a tendency that the secretion amount of MMP-3 in serum is increased in affection of rheumatoid arthritis, and along with this, the profile of the glycan is also changed largely.",
                                "The present inventors have experienced previously that there is a case where the profile of the glycan in a specific glycoprotein in serum is changed depending on the pathological conditions in affection of rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore have come up with a possibility that a change in the profile of the glycan of MMP-3 in serum appears depending on the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the MMP-3 proteins in serum increase by the affection of rheumatoid arthritis, but are extremely small as around 100 ng/ml to 1000 \u03bcg/ml at most, and the abundance ratio for the total amount of glycoproteins in blood is extremely small as 1/100 to 1/1,000,000 or less. Therefore, in specific detection of glycan change of the glycan of MMP-3 from the glycan of all glycoproteins contained in serum, it is difficult to perform accurate measurement because the S/N ratio becomes low, and the sensitivity is low. Accordingly, the present inventors have constructed a method in which structure information of glycan of MMP-3 in a minute amount in serum is obtained by utilizing an antibody-overlay-lectin array method using an anti-MMP-3 antibody. When this technique is applied to a commercially available recombinant MMP-3 protein, even with around 100 pg to 1 ng of MMP-3 protein, it has been possible to obtain the minimum glycan structure information. This indicates that analysis with an acute sensitivity is possible even in a minute amount of MMP-3 (around 40 ng/ml) contained in the blood of a healthy subject, and the glycan change depending on the medical condition can be studied.",
                                "Next, analysis by an antibody-overlay-lectin array method is applied to the serum of a patient affected with rheumatoid arthritis, and the like, a lectin recognizing a glycan specific to a glycan of MMP-3 in serum of a patient is selected, and identification of a glycan that becomes a rheumatoid arthritis biomarker is tried.",
                                "As a result, in MMP-3 in serum of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, significantly high signals are observed in ACG, Jacalin, ABA, and ACA of lectin. Herein, because lectins of Jacalin, ABA, and ACA other than ACG are apparently a lectin recognizing O-linked sugar chain (O-glycan), these results mean that in affection with rheumatoid arthritis, as a glycan of MMP-3 in serum, an O-linked glycan, that is, an O-linked glycan being recognized by a lectin of at least any one of the Jacalin, ABA, and ACA is present. Conventionally, as the glycan profile change in a serum glycoprotein, mainly a N-linked glycan has been attracting attention (Patent Document 18, and the like), and as for the glycan of MMP-3, there has been no report even on the presence of O-linked glycan, therefore, it is considered that the glycan has a novel glycan structure as a glycan structure of a glycan epitope specific to rheumatoid arthritis.",
                                "However, there may be a case that only with a glycan having a high expression level, glycans inherently possessed by MMP-3 are secreted regardless in the affection with rheumatoid arthritis, and along with the increase in a secretion level of MMP-3 into serum, an increase in signals is observed. Therefore, as to each lectin signal amount, when the correlation with the MMP-3 amount in serum is observed, all of ACG, ABA, and ACA have a high correlation with the expression level of MMP-3, but only the Jacalin lectin has a weak correlation, and a case where the Jacalin signal is remarkably low is observed in a group particularly with high expression level of MMP-3. When the correlation of the ABA and ACA that are highly correlated with MMP-3 with Jacalin is taken, the correlation between the ABA and the ACA is high, but the correlation of Jacalin with a lectin of either ABA or ACA is low.",
                                "These results may reflect the difference in glycan recognition between Jacalin and each of ABA and ACA. The present inventors thought from the findings so far that the difference in glycan modification to the 6-position of an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue bound to the peptide in the O-linked glycan has been reflected in the results. It has been found that particularly Jacalin cannot accept the modification to the 6-position of GalNAc of the O-linked glycan, and as a result of the modification, the reactivity to Jacalin is lost (Non-Patent Document 14). As the representative modification to the position, there is sialylation. Accordingly, by using some of the serum samples among the serums of the above-described patients, sialidase treatment is performed, the sialidase is a sialic acid-degrading enzyme. As a result of performing lectin array analysis to the samples before and after the sialidase treatment, in the sample after the sialidase treatment, Jacalin signals also show a correlation with the amount of MMP-3 in the similar manner as in ABA, and ACA.",
                                "From the above-described results, it was revealed that the blood MMP-3 level is increased, in affection with rheumatoid arthritis, but the sialylation to the GalNAc residue directly bound to the MMP-3 peptide in the O-linked glycan of the MMP-3 differs depending on a patient. Moreover, in the group of patients whose disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis has deteriorated, there is a remarkable tendency that the Jacalin signals weaken, therefore, the possibility that there is an inverse correlation between the deterioration of disease activity and the increase of sialylation.",
                                "Subsequently, the clinical usefulness of this difference is investigated, and as an index to capture the \u201cqualitative change\u201d of O-linked glycan of MMP-3, the ABA/Jacalin value is examined. As a result of statistically verifying the correlation between this value and the clinical parameters, there is a significant correlation between this value with all of the values of DAS28-CRP, DAS28-ESR, CDAI, SDAI, and doctor VAS (visual analogue scale), which are conventionally numerical values representing the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis, and in particular, the correlation with DAS28 showed as high as p\u22660.0001.",
                                "This means that according to an analysis technique of glycan of specific protein using a lectin as represented by a lectin array or a lectin-antibody sandwich ELISA method, only by measuring the reactivity of MMP-3 in serum to Jacalin as well as the reactivity to ABA, ACA or ACG and determining the ratio between the two, the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis can be objectively grasped without requiring any diagnosis by a skilled doctor and without performing any complicated calculation by complicated calculation formulas, and the same diagnostic accuracy of rheumatoid arthritis as that of DAS28 can be provided.",
                                "In addition, the glycan recognized by Jacalin is O-linked glycan, and has a core structure-1 (Core 1: Gal(\u03b21,3)GalNAc) or a Tn antigen (GalNAc) of the O-linked glycan which is bound to a Ser/Thr residue in a peptide chain. Further, in a case where sialic acid is introduced at the 6-position of GalNAc present in the glycan, the reactivity to Jacalin is inhibited by the modification. On the other hand, ABA and ACA are also O-linked glycan recognition lectins as Jacalin, but the sialylation at the position can be recognized, or accepted (Kuno A et al Molecular& Cellular Proteomics 8 (1) 99-108 (2009)). That is, the above-described results are results strongly suggesting that in affection with rheumatoid arthritis, sialylation to the 6-position of GalNAc residue in a core structure-1 of the O-linked glycan possessed by MMP-3 in serum is increased.",
                                "In order to verify this point, by using a synovial fluid sample collected from a lesion joint of an actual patient with rheumatoid arthritis, when Jacalin signals according to the MMP-3 level are plotted, a profile showing a clean inverse correlation was shown. On the other hand, the synovial fluid sample obtained from a patient with osteoarthritis that is difficult to be discriminated from early rheumatoid arthritis showed the same profile as that of healthy subjects.",
                                "This result demonstrates that in affection with rheumatoid arthritis, along with the deterioration of the pathological conditions, Jacalin-binding glycan epitopes of MMP-3, which are produced in synovial cells in a synovial tissue, are decreased, that is, it demonstrates that the sialylation to the 6-position of GalNAc residue in a core structure-1 of the O-linked glycan of the MMP-3 is increased. At the same time, the phenomenon of decrease of Jacalin-binding O-linked glycan epitopes of MMP-3, which is observed in a serum sample of a patient affected with rheumatoid arthritis, is nothing other than the exact reflection of the changes in glycan structure of the MMP-3 derived from a synovial tissue. This demonstrates also that accurate diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis can be performed with a serum sample that is less invasive for a subject.",
                                "The present inventors obtained the above-described findings, and thus have completed the present invention.",
                                "That is, according to the present invention, it can be said that a (negative) glycan biomarker of an inverse correlation with rheumatoid arthritis, which includes a Jacalin lectin-binding O-linked glycan epitope of MMP-3 in serum is provided. Specifically, by measuring a value obtained by correcting the reciprocal of Jacalin signals in blood (for example, serum) with the MMP-3 level or the ABA, ACA, or ACG signal level, the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis can be evaluated. Alternatively, also by observing the degree of sialic acid (NeuNAc) modification to the 6-position of GalNAc residue of \u201cGal(\u03b21,3)GalNAc\u201d, which is a core structure-1 of a Jacalin-binding O-linked glycan of MMP-3 in blood (serum) (when the sialylation increases, the reactivity to Jacalin decreases), the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis can be evaluated.",
                                "In the method for evaluating disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis according to the present invention, the rheumatoid arthritis can be detected and discriminated with clinically acceptable performance in terms of applicability, sensitivity, and accuracy. Moreover, the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis can be evaluated by a method capable of being applied in medical practice with a simple technique.",
                                "In the present invention, the decrease of rheumatoid arthritis glycan biomarkers in a test sample can be assayed by staining the labeled Jacalin, and further the labeled ABA, ACA and ACG, or by a sandwich method with the labeled MMP-3 or the labeled anti-MMP-3 antibody. As the anti-MMP-3 antibody used in the sandwich method, the commercially available ones (product name) can be used. In addition, in a case where the commercially available antibody is not used as the anti-MMP-3 antibody, based on the known sequence information of MMP-3, specific antibodies can be prepared by a known procedure. The antibody used in the present invention may be either a polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal antibody. These antibodies can be prepared in accordance with a conventional production method of antibodies or antiserum.",
                                "As the technique in order to analyze the glycan structure of Jacalin-binding O-linked glycan of MMP-3, which is a negative rheumatoid arthritis glycan biomarker of the present invention, glycan profiling by frontal affinity chromatography (FAC), lectin microarray, MS or MSn (mass spectrometry, or tandem mass spectrometry), or the like can be mentioned. Once the glycan structure is determined, based on the information, a positive rheumatoid arthritis glycan biomarker can be selected. The information on lectins can be available from lectin frontier database (LfDB), the website of Research Center for Medical Glycoscience, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, or the like. Further, an antibody recognizing the glycan structure can also be used.",
                                "By using the method for evaluating disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis according the present invention, and by using a blood sample (serum or plasma) of a subject suspected to be suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, the evaluation of disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis can be performed with simple and high accuracy in medical practice. Further, as the least invasive sample, a blood sample is preferred, similar results are obtained also with a joint fluid (synovial fluid), and in addition, even with a body fluid derived from a subject, such as pleural effusion, ascites, lymph, saliva, or spinal fluid, it is natural that the diagnosis can be performed in the similar way. Furthermore, in the following explanation, blood sample is mainly described as a typical example, but the present invention is not limited to the blood samples.",
                                "The present invention includes a kit for evaluation of disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis, which is used for performing the method for evaluating disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis according the present invention, and is provided with an anti-MMP-3 antibody together with Jacalin, and a lectin selected from the group consisting of ABA, ACA, and ACG, wherein either the lectins or the antibody being labeled.",
                                "In the kit, a lectin array in which multiple lectins containing Jacalin, and any lectin selected from the group consisting of ABA, ACA, and ACG are immobilized on a substrate is preferably used, and each lectin is made into a biotinylated lectin, and a lectin array in a form immobilizing the biotinylated lectins on a streptavidin-coated substrate can also be prepared.",
                                "In addition, in relation to the polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and relapsing polychondritis (RP), which are rheumatic diseases as rheumatoid arthritis is, in order to accurately determine the presence or absence of affection with each of the two, and in order to examine a biomarker to perform accurate discrimination from rheumatoid arthritis, the results of lectin array profiling are reviewed. Lectins named LEL and STL which exhibited statistically significantly difference, and both recognize a polylactosamine structure are selected, and by using newly prepared serum samples derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and relapsing polychondritis (RP), the reactivity of an MMP-3 concentrated fraction with LEL and STL lectins is examined.",
                                "As a result, the following significant results were obtained, for both lectins, the reactivities of samples derived from patients with relapsing polychondritis (RP) are extremely high, next, the reactivities of samples derived from patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) are high, and there is almost no reactivity in samples derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in samples derived from healthy control subjects (HC).",
                                "This indicates that the LEL or STL lectin-reactive glycan of MMP-3 becomes an excellent glycan biomarker for determination of affection with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and/or relapsing polychondritis (RP).",
                                "Further, it was confirmed that by taking the ratio of LEL lectin signals to Jacalin or ACG signals, only the ratio from serum derived from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows a high numerical value, compared with those from serum derived from a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a patient with relapsing polychondritis (RP), and a healthy control subject (HC).",

Further, early rheumatoid arthritis is difficult to be discriminated from other articular diseases such as osteoarthritis, but by the MMP-3 level in serum, which reflects the degree of cartilage destruction, rheumatoid arthritis can be diagnosed in the initial stage.",

The glycan structure and addition position information of MMP-3 glycan are poor, and it is known that with regard to N-linked glycan, the N-linked glycan is present in an enzyme active domain. However, there is no findings regarding the O-linked glycan at all. When predicted based on the findings of other MMPs, it is considered that the O-linked glycan of MMP-3 binding to Jacalin, ABA, and ACA lectins, in which changes of the glycan structure are observed in a synovial tissue and in serum after affection with rheumatoid arthritis, is present in multiple numbers on a hinge region of MMP-3, and the O-linked glycan may also be present in other regions.",

In addition, it is considered that the O-linked glycan is present in multiple numbers on a hinge region (linker domain) that connects an enzyme active domain (binding domain), and a hemopexin-like domain of MMP-3.

That is, it is considered that the decrease of the Jacalin signal level corresponds to the state in which a rate of sialylation at the 6-position of \u201cGalNAc\u201d of the above-described glycan backbone is increased. Furthermore, Jacalin is a representative example in which the binding ability is decreased by \u03b12,6 sialic acid modification to GalNAc, and a lectin, a glycan-recognizing antibody, a glycan-recognizing peptide, or a glycan-recognizing aptamer, which has the similar characteristics, can be substituted.",

Further, it is concluded that the degree of the \u03b12,6 sialylation to GalNAc is low frequency in a healthy subject, but the degree of the modification is increased as the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis increases.",

The evanescent wave excitation fluorescence detection method is a method utilizing the fact that when light is made incident under the conditions such that total reflection occurs on the end face (side face) of a slide glass, in a case of two phases having different refractive indexes, such as glass (solid phase) and water (liquid phase), light in extremely short range called \u201cevanescent waves\u201d (called near-field light) oozes out only in the near field of around several hundred nm from the interface. According to this method, excitation light for a fluorescent substance is incident from the end face, and only the fluorescent substance existing in the near field is excited, and fluorescence observation is performed. The evanescent wave excitation fluorescence detection method is described in Non-Patent Document 16, or the like. In this detection, GlycoStation (trademark) Reader 1200 (manufactured by MORITEX Corporation, and GlycoTechnica Ltd.), or the like can be used.",

This is considered to be a cluster effect due to the presence of multiple O-linked glycans that are assumed to be present in a hinge region of MMP-3. It is said that the interaction between the lectin with high density immobilized on a substrate, and the glycan has 2 digits or more of effects in binding constant due to the cluster effect. In addition, it is considered that the cluster effect is said in particular to have an effect of remarkably slowing the dissociation rate, therefore, the detection is also possible in a detection system requiring a washing process. Accordingly, an antibody-overlay-lectin array method that is an indirect method containing a washing process, or as described later, a general detection method as used in a detection system of antigen-antibody reaction, such as a sandwich ELISA method can be applied.",

As described above, a method in which based on the level of a certain lectin, signals of the target lectin are converted into a relative value and used for discrimination can be performed according to a literature (Non-Patent Document 17) previously published by the present inventors. The setting of the cutoff value can be performed in advance using a body fluid, for example, serum, sampled from multiple patients with rheumatoid arthritis. That is, based on the above-described relative values obtained in advance from the lectin array analysis targeting the serum derived from multiple patient with rheumatoid arthritis and the serum of healthy subjects, the glycosylation discrimination index (X or Y) described later is calculated. More preferably, multiple glycosylation discrimination indexes corresponding to the degree of disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis are prepared in advance, and as compared with the glycosylation discrimination index derived from a blood sample, the degree of the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis of a subject is determined, and also it is determined whether or not the subject is affected with rheumatoid arthritis, or how the degree of the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis is.",

In that case, a blood sample is added to perform an antigen-antibody reaction, and then labeled Jacalin, and another labeled lectin (ABA, ACA, or ACG) are reacted, and each signal level can be measured.",

                                "An ELISA method is a well-known technique, and may be performed in accordance with ordinary procedures, and an optimum measuring device can be applied for each labeling.",
                                "In quantitative detection of rheumatoid arthritis biomarkers by the present method, by using the Jacalin-binding MMP-3, which is prepared from serum or the like and whose protein amount is known, as a standard substance, a calibration curve is created and can be converted into a substantial amount of the standard substance. Recombinant MMP-3 may be used as a standard substance as long as the binding ability to Jacalin is recognized. For example, as in Example 1, commercially available recombinant MMP-3 (product number 513-MP-010, manufactured by R&D Systems Inc.), which has been massively expressed in mouse myeloma cells (NO cells) and purified, can be used as a standard substance. Further, in an evaluation method without using a standard substance, following the lectin array method described above, a lectin in which the signals do not vary depending on the lesion is used as an internal standard lectin, the Jacalin signals are converted to a relative value, and then determination of exceeding or not exceeding a certain cutoff value is made. In addition, selection of the internal standard lectin, and setting of the cutoff value can be performed in advance by using blood samples of a large number of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis in which the disease activity has been found. That is, in advance, from lectin array analysis that targets blood samples collected from a large number of patients having different disease activities, the internal standard can be statistically set beforehand. In addition, based on the above-described relative value obtained in advance by ELISA measurement that targets blood samples collected from a large number of patients having different disease activities, a discriminant is created. More preferably, multiple discriminants corresponding to the progress of the rheumatoid arthritis or the degree of the deterioration of disease activity are created, the progress of the rheumatoid arthritis or the degree of the deterioration of disease activity of a blood sample is determined, and also it is determined whether or not the subject is affected with rheumatoid arthritis, or what extent the stage of the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis is.",
                                "For example, in a case where ABA is used as an internal standard lectin, by using the numerical values obtained by the measurement of sandwiching 40 \u03bcL each of blood samples between MMP-3-ABA and MMP-3-Jacalin, it is determined as follows: remission when the MMP-3-ABA/MMP-3-Jacalin ratio is less than 2, low disease activity when the ratio is 2 or more to less than 3, moderate disease activity when the ratio is 3 or more to less than 8, and high disease activity when the ratio is 8 or more.",
                                "In addition, the ELISA measurement can be replaced with a measurement method based on a different interaction analysis principle, such as microarray and SPR. In that case, those measurement methods are well-known techniques, therefore, may be performed in accordance with ordinary procedures, and an optimum measuring device can be applied for each technique."

The solution was added to each reaction vessel (7 reaction vessels had been formed per glass slide) of a lectin microarray (LecChip (trademark) (manufactured by GlycoTechnica Ltd.)), and the resultant mixture was subjected to interaction at 20\u00b0 C. for 10 hours or more. As a result, the binding reaction between the MMP-3 glycan in the sample and the 45 kinds of the lectins immobilized on the array substrate reached the equilibrium state. After that, into the resultant mixture, in order to prevent the glycan of antibodies for detection from binding to unreacted lectins on the substrate and generating noise signals, 2 \u03bcL (equivalent to 20 \u03bcg) of human serum-derived IgG solution (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC.) was added, and the resultant mixture was reacted for 30 minutes. After performing this blocking reaction, each reaction vessel was washed three times with 60 \u03bcL of PBSTx, and then 2 \u03bcL of human serum-derived IgG solution was added again to 58 \u03bcL of the PBSTx solution. After slightly stirring the resultant mixture, anti-MMP-3 antibodies (biotinylated product) for detection were added in an amount equivalent to 100 ng, and the reaction was performed at 20\u00b0 C. for one hour. After the antigen-antibody reaction, each reaction vessel was washed three times with 60 \u03bcL of PBSTx, and then, into the resultant mixture, a PBSTx solution containing Cy-3 labeled streptavidin (manufactured by GE Healthcare) in an amount equivalent to 200 ng was added, and further the resultant mixture was subjected to a reaction at 20\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. After the reaction, each reaction vessel was washed three times with 60 \u03bcL of PBSTx, and then array scanning was performed with an array scanner GlycoStation (trademark) (manufactured by GlycoTechnica Inc.).",

Acquired signals were increased and decreased depending on the MMP-3 level in blood. In FIG. 3, a typical example of the data of 30 cases measured is shown. The lectins showing significant signal intensity in all of the cases were only four kinds of ACG, ABA, Jacalin, and ACA. In addition, ACG is a lectin recognizing \u03b12,3 sialic acid, and ABA, Jacalin, ACA are lectins recognizing an O-linked glycan that basically has a core 1 structure or a Tn structure as the skeleton, although the detailed specificities are different from one another.",
                                "From the above, the MMP-3 glycan structure, as shown in FIG. 4, is assumed to be an O-linked glycan having a core 1 structure or a Tn structure as the skeleton, and a structural group having a different degree of the sialylation.",
                                "Next, the correlation between the lectin signals and the MMP-3 level in blood was examined. As shown in FIG. 5, ACG, ABA, and ACA showed relatively strong correlation, but Jacalin does not show any correlation. This divergence in Jacalin was observed also in a case where the correlation between the O-linked glycan recognition lectins was examined (FIG. 6). It has revealed in analysis of other glycoproteins (Non-Patent Document 14) that each of these three O-linked glycan recognition lectins has a difference in the specificity, and further the tolerance is different and the reactivity of Jacalin decreases most particularly in a case where \u03b12,6 sialic acid (NeuNAc) modification is introduced into GalNAc having a core 1 structure. Specifically, in a case of Jacalin, introduction of the modification of \u03b12,6 sialic acid (NeuNAc) into GalNAc having a core 1 structure of an O-linked glycan is not acceptable, however, in a case of each of the ABA and ACA, the introduction is acceptable, or is irrelevant.",
                                "From the above, it was suggested that the MMP-3 O-linked glycan, with which the blood concentration is increased associated with the affection with rheumatoid arthritis, is rich in the sialylation, particularly \u03b12,6 sialylation to the core 1 structure as compared with that of the MMP-3 also present in serum of healthy subjects.",

Based on these signal levels, when the ability to detect only RA among diseases was examined by ROC analysis, it was shown that there is high discrimination ability of AOC=0.95 to 0.98 (lower part in FIG. 17).",
