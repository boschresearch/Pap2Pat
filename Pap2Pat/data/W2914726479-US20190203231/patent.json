                        "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) were originally discovered to act as immunity defense mechanisms against foreign pathogens in prokaryotic cells (Mojica et al. (2005) J. of Molecular Evolution 60:174-182). Cas9, a protein for the type II CRISPR/Cas system, was found to exhibit DNA cleavage activity. The nuclease activity of Cas9 can be guided by a CRISPR RNA and a trans-activating CRISPR RNA complementary to a targeted sequence of DNA in the genome (Jinek et al. (2012) Science 337:816-821). Since trans-activating CRISPR RNA and CRISPR RNA can be made into a chimeric RNA containing the full function of both RNA species, artificial fusion RNA sequences, also called guide RNAs (gRNAs), were generated to target the activity of Cas9 to a target DNA sequence (Esvelt et al. (2014) eLife:e03401). A D10A mutation present in the catalytic domain of Cas9 converts it to a nickase that produces single nucleotide breaks at the target DNA (Jinek et al. (2012) Science 337:816-821). Double nicking of target DNA can increase genome editing specificity by 50-1500 fold (Ranet al. (2013) Cell 154:1380-1389), with the off-target rate as low as 1/10,000. Such specificity can make somatic genomic targeting a viable approach in treating human diseases.",
                        "Despite a high incidence, only a fraction of men diagnosed with prostate cancer develop metastases and even fewer die from the disease. The majority of prostate cancers remain asymptomatic and clinically indolent. The precise mechanisms for the development of progressive, clinically concerning prostate cancer remain elusive. Furthermore, the inability to predict prostate cancer's potential aggressiveness has resulted in significant overtreatment of the disease. The dichotomous nature of prostate cancer\u2014a subset of life-threatening malignancies in the larger background of histological alterations lacking the clinical features implicit with that label\u2014is a fundamental challenge in disease management. Treatment of prostate cancer, particularly of those metastatic prostate cancers remains problematic. Therefore, there is a need in the art for methods of treating a subject that may develop progressive prostate cancer."

                                "In certain embodiments, the genome editing technique can include the use of one or more guide RNAs (gRNAs), complementary to a specific sequence within a genome, e.g., a chromosomal breakpoint associated with a fusion gene, including protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs), to guide a nuclease, e.g., an endonuclease, to the specific genomic sequence. A non-limiting example of an endonuclease includes the clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9). In certain embodiments, the endonuclease can result in the cleavage of the targeted genome sequence and allow modification of the genome at the cleavage site through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the genome editing method and/or technique can be used to target a sequence of a fusion gene present in a cell, e.g., in a prostate cancer cell, to promote homologous recombination to insert a nucleic acid into the genome of the cell. For example, and not by way of limitation, the genome editing technique can be used to target the region where the two genes of the fusion gene are joined together (i.e., the junction and/or chromosomal breakpoint). As normal, non-cancerous, prostate cells do not contain the fusion gene, and therefore do not contain the chromosomal breakpoint associated with the fusion gene, prostate cancer cells can be specifically targeted using this genome editing technique. In certain embodiments, the genome editing technique can be used to target the junction (i.e., breakpoint) of a fusion gene selected from TRMT11-GRIK2, SLC45A2-AMACR, MTOR-TP53BP1, LRRC59-FLJ60017, TMEM135-CCDC67, KDM4B-AC011523.2, MAN2A1-FER, PTEN-NOLC1, CCNH-C5orf30, ZMPSTE24-ZMYM4, CLTC-ETV1, ACPP-SEC13, DOCK7-OLR1 and PCMTD1-SNTG1. For example, and not by way of limitation, the gRNAs can be designed to target (e.g., be complementary to) the sequences flanking the chromosomal breakpoint region (see, for example, FIGS. 15 and 29) to guide an endonuclease, e.g., Cas9D10A, to the chromosomal breakpoint region.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the disclosed genome editing technique can be used to promote homologous recombination with a sequence of a fusion gene, e.g., at a chromosomal breakpoint (junction) of a fusion gene, in one or more cells of a subject to allow the insertion of a nucleic acid sequence that when expressed results in the death, e.g., apoptosis, of the one or more cells. For example, and not by way of limitation, the nucleic acid sequence (also referred to herein as a donor nucleic acid) can encode the Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase, Exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Diphtheria toxin from Corynebacterium diphtheri, Ricin or abrin from Ricinus communi (castor oil plant), Cytosine deaminase from bacteria or yeast, Carboxyl esterase or Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) thymidine kinase. Additional non-limiting examples of nucleic acids and/or genes that can be inserted into the genome of a cell carrying a fusion gene to induce cell death are disclosed in Rajab et al. (2013) (J. of Genetics Syndromes and Gene Therapy, 4(9):187) and Zarogoulidis et al. (2013) (J. of Genetics Syndromes and Gene Therapy, 4(9):pii: 16849). In certain non-limiting embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence, e.g., the HSV-1 thymidine kinase nucleic acid sequence, is not operably linked to a regulatory sequence promoter (e.g., a promoter) and requires integration into the genome for expression. For example, and not by way of limitation, the promoter of the head gene of the fusion gene can promote the expression of the donor nucleic acid sequence.",
                                "In certain embodiments where a nucleic acid encoding HSV-1 thymidine kinase is inserted in the genome of one or more cells of a subject, a therapeutically effective amount of the guanine derivative, ganciclovir, or its oral homolog, valganciclovir, can be administered to the subject. HSV-1 thymidine kinase can phosphorylate and convert ganciclovir and/or valganciclovir into the triphosphate forms of ganciclovir and/or valganciclovir in the one or more cells of the subject. The triphosphate form of ganciclovir and/or valganciclovir acts as competitive inhibitor of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) and is a poor substrate of DNA elongation, and can result in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The inhibition of DNA synthesis, in turn, can result in the reduction and/or inhibition of growth and/or survival and/or cell death of prostate cancer cells that contain the targeted chromosomal breakpoint and the integrated HSV-1 thymidine kinase nucleic acid sequence. This genome editing method can be used to produce an anti-cancer effect in a subject, e.g., a prostate cancer subject, that has been determined to have a fusion gene and/or an increased risk for progressive prostate cancer.",
                                "In certain embodiments, a genome editing technique of the present disclosure can include the introduction of an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a Cas protein or a mutant thereof, e.g., Cas9D10A, into one or more cells of the subject, e.g., prostate cancer cells, carrying a fusion gene. In certain embodiments, the vector can further comprise one or more gRNAs for targeting the Cas9 protein to a specific nucleic acid sequence within the genome.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the one or more gRNAs can hybridize to a target sequence within a fusion gene. For example, and not by way of limitation, the one or more gRNAs can target the chromosomal breakpoint of a fusion gene and/or target the one or more sequences that flank the chromosomal breakpoint region. Non-limiting examples of sequences of fusion gene chromosomal breakpoints are disclosed herein and within the Figures (see, for example, Table 1). In certain embodiments, one gRNA can be complementary to a region within one of the genes of the fusion gene and another gRNA can be complementary to a region within the other gene of the fusion gene. For example, and not by way of limitation, one gRNA can be complementary to a region within the TMEM135 gene of the TMEM135-CCDC67 fusion gene and another gRNA can be complementary to a region within the CCDC67 gene. In certain embodiments, one gRNA can be complementary to a region upstream of the chromosomal breakpoint of a fusion gene and another gRNA can be complementary to a region downstream of the chromosomal breakpoint. In certain embodiments, genome sequencing can be performed to determine the regions of the fusion gene that can be targeted by the gRNAs. In certain embodiment, the regions of the genes that are targeted by the gRNAs can be introns and/or exons.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the Cas protein can be operably linked to a regulatory element, and when transcribed, the one or more gRNAs can direct the Cas protein to the target sequence in the genome and induce cleavage of the genomic loci by the Cas protein. In certain embodiments, the Cas9 protein cut about 3-4 nucleotides upstream of the PAM sequence present adjacent to the target sequence. In certain embodiments, the regulatory element operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the Cas protein can be a promoter, e.g., an inducible promoter such as a doxycycline inducible promoter. The term \u201coperably linked,\u201d when applied to DNA sequences, for example in an expression vector, indicates that the sequences are arranged so that they function cooperatively in order to achieve their intended purposes, i.e., a promoter sequence allows for initiation of transcription that proceeds through a linked coding sequence as far as the termination signal.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the Cas9 enzyme encoded by a vector of the present invention can comprise one or more mutations. The mutations may be artificially introduced mutations or gain- or loss-of-function mutations. Non-limiting examples of such mutations include mutations in a catalytic domain of the Cas9 protein, e.g., the RuvC and HNH catalytic domains, such as the D10 mutation within the RuvC catalytic domain and the H840 in the HNH catalytic domain. In certain embodiments, a mutation in one of the catalytic domains of the Cas9 protein results in the Cas9 protein functioning as a \u201cnickase,\u201d where the mutated Cas9 protein cuts only one strand of the target DNA, creating a single-strand break or \u201cnick.\u201d In certain embodiments, the use of a mutated Cas9 protein, e.g., Cas9D10A, allows the use of two gRNAs to promote cleavage of both strands of the target DNA. Additional non-limiting examples of Cas9 mutations include VP64, KRAB and SID4X.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the genome editing technique of the present disclosure can further include introducing into the one or more cells an additional vector comprising a nucleic acid, that when expressed results in the death, e.g., apoptosis, of the one or more cells. In certain embodiments, this vector can further comprise one or more targeting sequences that are complementary (e.g., can hybridize) to the same and/or adjacent to the genomic sequences targeted by the gRNAs to allow homologous recombination to occur and insertion of the nucleic acid sequence (i.e., donor nucleic acid sequence) into the genome. In certain embodiments, the additional vector can further comprise one or more splice tag sequences of an exon/intron junction of a gene that makes up the fusion gene. In certain embodiments, the targeting sequences can be complementary to an intron, exon sequence and/or intron/extron splicing sequence within a gene of the fusion gene. In certain embodiments, one targeting sequence can be complementary to a region within one of the genes of the fusion gene targeted by the gRNAs and a second targeting sequence can be complementary to a region within the other gene of the fusion gene, to allow homologous recombination between the vector comprising the donor nucleic acid and the genome sequence cleaved by the Cas9 protein. For example, and not by way of limitation, one targeting sequence can be complementary to a region within the TMEM135 gene of the TMEM135-CCDC67 fusion gene and another targeting sequence can be complementary to a region within the CCDC67 gene. In certain embodiments, one targeting sequence can be complementary to a region upstream of the cleavage site generated by the Cas9 protein and another targeting sequence can be complementary to a region downstream of the chromosomal breakpoint. Non-limiting examples of the types of nucleic acid sequences that can be inserted into the genome are disclosed above. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid that is to be inserted into the genome encodes HSV-1 thymidine kinase. Additional non-limiting examples of nucleic acids and/or genes that can be inserted into the genome of a cell carrying a fusion gene to induce cell death are set forth above.",
                                "The vectors for use in the present disclosure can be any vector known in the art. For example, and not by way of limitation, the vector can be derived from plasmids, cosmids, viral vectors and yeast artificial chromosomes. In certain embodiments, the vector can be a recombinant molecule that contains DNA sequences from several sources. In certain embodiments, the vector can include additional segments such as, but not limited to, promoters, transcription terminators, enhancers, internal ribosome entry sites, untranslated regions, polyadenylation signals, selectable markers, origins of replication and the like. In certain embodiments, the vectors can be introduced into the one or more cells by any technique known in the art such as by transfection and transduction. In certain embodiments, the vectors can be introduced by adenovirus transduction.",

Furthermore, the inability to predict prostate cancer's potential aggressiveness has resulted in significant overtreatment of the disease.

In one patient, normal adjacent prostate tissue was not available. An average of 200 GB was sequenced per sample to achieve 33 fold coverage of the entire genome. Total RNA from all T and AT samples was sequenced to achieve >1333 (average 400 million reads/sample) fold coverage per gene. Total RNA from four age-matched, entirely histologically benign prostate tissues harvested from healthy organ donors was similarly sequenced as a tissue control. The sequencing data were aligned to human reference genome HG193. Fusion genes were then identified and validated. We hypothesize that these fusion genes from cancer samples that prove metastatic are associated poor clinical outcome for prostate cancer patients. A prediction model for prostate cancer recurrence and short post-operative prostate specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) was built. This model was then applied to 89 additional prostate cancer samples from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 30 samples from Stanford University Medical Center, and 36 samples from University of Wisconsin Madison Medical Center with follow-up ranging from 1 to 15 years. One hundred twenty-seven of these samples are from patients who experienced prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy, and 106 are from patients with no evidence of recurrence for at least 5 years after the surgery.

The presence for each fusion pair was coded either as 1 or 0 to represent whether the fusion gene exist in the sample. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to build a classifier. In light of relatively rare occurrence of the fusion transcripts (4.4%-9.0%) in our 90-sample Pittsburgh training cohort, we also applied a simple prediction rule based on the presence in any subset of the eight fusion genes (i.e., a patient is predicted as recurrence if any fusion transcript in a designated subset exists). Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was applied to construct the model and evaluate the prediction performance. ROC curves were constructed by varying the parameters in the LDA classifier construction and the optimal prediction model was selected with the best Youden index (=sensitivity+specificity\u22121)22, and was then evaluated in a 89-sample Pittsburgh test cohort, a 21-sample Stanford test cohort and a 30-sample Wisconsin test cohort.

                                "A total of 76 RNA fusion events were identified in prostate cancer samples by the Fusioncatcher7 program. Thirteen of these fusion events were suggested by genome sequencing. To control for tissue-based fusion gene events, fusion genes present in any of the four age-matched organ donor prostate tissues were eliminated (Table 5). Further, fusion genes with less than 20 kb between each element and read in the cis direction were also eliminated. As a result of this filtering, 28 of 76 fusion gene events were identified as prostate cancer specific (Table 6 and FIG. 6). Among these fusion events, TMPRSS2-ERG, the most common prostate cancer fusion gene13-15, was found in two prostate cancer samples. Majority of the fusion events identified are novel and not reported in the literature. None of the 29 fusion genes were identified in the matched AT transcriptome analysis. To validate these fusion genes, RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for fusion gene regions encompassing the fusion breakpoints and the PCR products were sequenced. Eight of these fusion gene events were validated through sequencing (FIG. 1).",
                                "Five of the eight fusion events resulted in truncation of a driver gene and frameshift in translation of a passenger gene. One of the fusion genes produced a truncated cyclin H and an independent open reading frame of a novel protein whose function is not known. Two fusion events, however, produced chimera proteins that possibly retain at least partial function of both genes. One of these fusion products is N-terminus 703 amino acids of \u03b1-Mannosidase 2A (MAN2A1) fusing to the C-terminus 250 amino acids of FER, a Feline tyrosine kinase. The fusion protein retains the glycoside hydrolase domain but has its manosidase domain replaced with a tyrosine kinase domain from FER. Another fusion protein product produces a chimera of membrane-associated transporter protein (SLC45A20) and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). The chimera protein has 5 of its 10 transmembrane domains deleted from SLC45A2 and replaced with methyl-acyl CoA transferase domain from AMACR. Interestingly, both MAN2A1-FER and SLC45A2-AMACR fusions are in the trans-direction, eliminating the possibility of a fusion event from simple chromosome deletion or collapse of extremely large RNA transcript.",
                                "Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Suggests Genome Recombination Underlying Fusion Gene Formation.",
                                "To investigate the mechanism of these fusion events, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on prostate cancer tissues where the fusion gene was present. Using the probes surrounding MAN2A1 breakpoint, a physical separation of signals between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 MAN2A1 in cancer cells containing the fusion gene was observed, in contrast to the overlapping nature of these signals in the wild type alleles in normal prostate epithelial cells (FIG. 2). Similar \u201cbreak-apart\u201d hybridization occurred in SLC45A2-AMACR positive prostate cancer samples (FIG. 2B). These findings indicate that MAN2A1-FER and SLC45A2-AMACR fusions are the result of chromosome recombination. Interestingly, in prostate cancer cells containing \u201cbreak-apart\u201d signals of MAN2A1, only 31% of the cells retained the 3\u2032 end signal, suggesting that the recombination of genome DNA in most prostate cancer cells results in truncation of the C-terminus of MAN2A1. A similar \u201ccollateral loss\u201d of the N-terminus of AMACR was found in prostate cancer cells expressing SLC45A2-AMACR fusion (29% retaining the N-terminus signal of AMACR). Other FISH analyses confirm that genome translocations occur in cancer cells expressing TRMT11-GRIK2, MTOR-TP53BP1, LRRC59-FLJ60017, TMEM137-CCDC67, CCNH-C5orf30 and KDM4B-AC011523.2 fusion genes (FIGS. 2C-G). These fusion genes are either separated by a large segment of genome DNA (TRMT11-GRIK2, TMEM135-CCDC67, CCNH-C5orf30 and KDM4B-AC011523.2) or located in separate chromosomes (MTOR-TP53BP1 and LRRC59-FLJ60017). The joining signals of hybridizations in prostate cancer cells suggest that these fusion genes were relocated to juxtapose to their fusion partners. Finally, genomic breakpoints were identified in 3 fusion pair through Sanger sequencing of the cancer genomic DNA (CCNH-C5orf30, TMEM135-CCDC67 and LRRC59-FLJ60017) (FIG. 11).",
                                "Fusion Genes Association with Prostate Cancer Recurrence.",
                                "A genomic alteration in prostate cancer without clinical consequence is of limited significance. Therefore, the association of these fusion genes with prostate cancer progression was investigated in prostate cancer specimens obtained from 213 men and from entirely benign prostate tissues obtained from 10 organ donors free of urological disease aged 20 to 70. The prostate cancer samples were linked to the clinical outcomes after radical prostatectomy: those with no detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after a minimum of five years of observation, those whose clinical outcomes remain unknown and those who had an observed PSA recurrence within five years. For 179 of the 223 prostate cancer samples, clinical outcome data after radical prostatectomy were available, and 81 had no detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after a minimum of five years of follow-up, while 98 developed biochemical recurrence (defined as a measurable PSA \u22650.2 ng/ml). Only 7.4% (6/81) primary prostate cancers expressed one of the fusion genes in non-recurrent patients. In contrast, 52% (51/98) primary prostate cancers expressed at least one fusion in patients who developed recurrence (FIG. 3 and FIG. 7A). No fusion genes were detected in benign prostate tissues obtained from healthy organ donors (FIG. 7B). Three fusion events were observed exclusively in recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (TRMT11-GRIK2, MTOR-TP53BP1 and LRRC59-FLJ60017; FIGS. 3A and B).",
                                "Fisher's exact test showed a significant difference in recurrent status between patients with at least one of the 8 fusion transcripts and those without (p=6.8\u00d71016). In the combined UPMC, Stanford and Wisconsin data sets, 91% (69/76) of patients positive for one of the fusion transcripts experienced prostate cancer recurrence in 5 years after prostate resection. Based on the hypothesis that the presence of at least one of the 8 fusion transcripts would indicate a recurrence for a prostate cancer patient, a prostate cancer prediction model was built and tested, using 90 randomly selected prostate cancer samples from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (training set). This training cohort yielded an accuracy of prostate cancer recurrence prediction of 71% with 89% specificity and 58% sensitivity (p<0.005) (FIG. 12A, Table 10). When this model was applied to a separate cohort of 89 samples (test set), the model correctly predicted recurrence in 70% of patients. To further validate this model, we tested its performance in a 30-patient (21 with qualified clinical follow-up) cohort from Stanford University Medical Center and a 36-patient (30 with qualified clinical follow-up) cohort from University of Wisconsin Madison Medical Center (FIG. 3, FIG. 8 and FIG. 9). Once again, the model correctly predicted recurrence with 76.2% accuracy and with 89% specificity and 67% sensitivity on the prostate cancer cohort from Stanford, and 80% accuracy and with 100% specificity and 63% sensitivity on the cohort from Wisconsin (Table 11).",
                                "Similar to the dichotomous nature of prostate cancer in general, recurrent prostate cancer can progress in an indolent or aggressive manner. A PSA doubling time (PSADT) less than four months after radical prostatectomy is strongly associated with the early development of metastatic disease and prostate cancer-specific death, whereas these events are rare and remote in men with a PSADT of greater than 15 months16, 17. Strong association was found between the fusion genes (e.g., TRMT11-GRIK2, SLC45A2-AMACR, MTOR-TP53BP1, LRRC59-FLJ60017, TMEM135-CCDC67 and CCNH-C5orf30) with prostate cancer recurrence (p=4.2\u00d710\u22129) and a PSADT less than four months (p=6\u00d710\u22129). To examine whether these fusion gene events have prognostic value for prostate cancer clinical outcome, receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses with varying weights of fusion genes were performed. As shown in FIG. 3C, the panel of eight fusion genes correctly predicted 74.4% for PSA doubling time less than four months in the 90-sample training cohort, and 67% for prostate cancer recurrence. To optimize the prediction model, six fusion genes were selected for an improved association with disease-free survival after radical prostatectomy. When the same algorithm was applied to a separate 89-sample test set from University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and 21-sample cohort from Stanford University Medical Center, the prediction rate for PSADT<4 months was found to be 78% and 71%, respectively (FIG. 4B). As shown in FIG. 3D, 89.5% of patients had an observed disease recurrence within five years of radical prostatectomy if they carried any of the six fusion genes. In addition, and as shown in FIG. 4C, 84.2% of patients had an observed disease recurrence within five years of radical prostatectomy if they carried any of the eight fusion genes. No patient survived five years without recurrence if their primary prostate cancer contained a TRMT11-GRIK2 or MTOR-TP53BP1 fusion gene. In contrast, 68% patients were free of disease recurrence if any of the novel fusion genes were not detected in their primary prostate cancer. Similar findings were also identified in the Stanford cohort: 88.9% patients experienced recurrence of prostate cancer if they carried any fusion transcript, while 66.7% patients were free of the disease recurrence if they are negative.",
                                "The most frequent fusion events in prostate cancer are TRMT11-GRIK2 (7.9%, or 22/279) and SLC45A2-AMACR (7.2%, or 20/279) (FIGS. 3A, 7-9). TRMT11-GRIK2 fusion represents a giant truncation of TRMT11, a tRNA methyltransferase, and elimination of GRIK2, a glutamate receptor but reported to possess tumor suppressor activity18. Indeed, GRIK2 was not expressed in prostate cancer samples that contain TRMT11-GRIK2 fusions, while it was detected in organ donor prostate samples (FIG. 10). Only 4 of 14 samples with TRMT11-GRIK2 expressed full length non-fusion TRMT11. Thus, the fusion event of TRMT11-GRIK2 represents a loss of function instead of a gain.",

                                "Prostate cancer samples with at least one fusion transcript correlate with more advanced stage of prostate cancer (p=0.004), Lymph node involvement status (P=0.005) and lower nomogram scores (p=0.0003) (Table 12). Gleason grading alone produced a prostate cancer recurrence prediction rate of 61.1%, with 85.7% specificity and 39.6% sensitivity in the 90-sample UPMC training cohort, when Gleason \u22658 was used as cutoff to predict prostate cancer recurrence. The Gleason model yielded prediction accuracy ranging from 57-60% in 3 separate testing cohorts (Tables 13 and 14). However, when fusion transcript status was combined with Gleason Grade >8, improvement of prediction was found for all 4 cohorts: 72% for the UPMC training cohort, 74% for the UPMC test cohort, 76% for the Stanford cohort and 90% for the Wisconsin cohort. ROC showed a significant larger AUC (area under the curve) (0.84 versus 0.67, P=6.6\u00d710-7) and higher testing accuracy (77.7% versus 59.7%, P=0.0019) (FIG. 5A) when Gleason score was combined with detection of any of 8 fusion transcripts. Similarly, Nomogram prediction of prostate cancer recurrence has the best accuracy of 76% with 68.8% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity in the analysis of 90-sample UPMC training cohort (Table 15). When this model was applied to UPMC testing, Stanford and Wisconsin cohorts independently, the results showed that the prediction accuracy ranged from 60% to 75% among the 3 cohorts (Table 16). When Nomogram was combined with the status of 8 fusion transcripts using LDA technique to build a classifier, the accuracy of prediction improves to 81-83% among the testing cohorts (Table 16). ROC showed an increase of AUC from 0.76 to 0.87 (P=0.0001) and an improvement of accuracy from 69% to 81% (P=0.026, FIG. 5B). As a result, we concluded that classifier combining Nomogram and the 8 fusion gene panel generated the best prediction accuracy that outperforms each diagnostic tool alone."

                                "Transcriptome and whole genome sequencings revealed numerous fusion RNA transcripts occurring not just in prostate cancer but also in healthy organ donor prostate samples (Table 17). Some of these fusion events are verifiable by sequencing on the cDNA products. The functions of these new transcripts are not known. Since most of these chimeric RNA transcripts in healthy individuals are the splicing products of two adjacent genes, they are likely the new isoforms of the existing genes. These previously defined independent \u201cgenes\u201d in the transcript could be one of the preferred spliced isoforms of the existing larger genes.",
                                "This analysis reveals significant number of cancer specific fusion gene events. These fusions are not detectable in either organ donor prostate or benign prostate tissues from prostate cancer patients. Most of these fusion transcripts appear to express in low abundance, with only an average 6.6 reads of these fusion transcripts detected in >1333\u00d7 sequencing. Indeed, when the coverage was reduced to 600\u00d7 in simulation studies, only MTOR-TP53BP1 was detected consistently. The characteristics of these fusion genes are that they either have a large distance between the joining genes or have trans-direction of fusion that could only occur when chromosome recombination happens. In either scenario, DNA alteration in genome level must be the underlying mechanism.",
                                "Although the association between the eight novel fusion transcripts and prostate cancer recurrence is striking, the biological roles of these fusion transcripts are not yet elucidated. Given the known function of the genes contributing to the fusion transcripts, their formation may have impact on several cell pathways such as RNA stability24 (TRMT11-GRIK2), protein glycosylation25 (MAN2A1-FER), cell cycle progression26,27, 28 (CCNH-C5orf50 and MTORTP53BP1), fibroblast growth factor nuclear import29 (LRRC59-FLJ60017), histone demethylation30 (KDM4B-AC011523.2), and fatty acid metabolism31 (SLC45A2-AMACR). Many of these pathways appear to be fundamental to cell growth and survival.",
                                "Two of the fusion genes are of particular interest: MAN2A1-FER and SLC45A2-AMACR. First, MAN2A1 is a mannosidase critical in glycosylation of proteins19. It is usually located in Golgi apparatus. The truncation in MAN2A1-FER replaces the mannosidase domain with a tyrosine kinase domain from FER20, while leaves the glycosyl transferase domain intact. The chimera protein likely loses the mannosidase function. The new kinase domain in MAN2A1-FER may confer the chimera protein a tyrosine kinase activity. Thus, the impact of this fusion gene could be profound: abnormal glycosylation and phosphorylation in hundreds of secreted or plasma membrane proteins. It may impact on cell-cell interactions and signal transduction, and generate a new immune response to the cancer cells. Second, AMACR is a racemase that catalyzes 2R stereoisomers of phytanic and pristanic acid to their S counterparts. AMACR is essential for \u03b2-oxidation of branch fatty acid in mitochondria. SLC45A2 is a transmembrane solute carrier known for its protective role in melanoma. SLC45A2-AMACR chimeric protein has 5 transmembrane domains of SLC45A2 truncated and replaced with a largely intact racemase. SLC45A2-AMACR also loses the mitochondria target site in AMACR. Presumably, the fusion protein would be located in the plasma membrane. It is of interest that all prostate cancer samples with SLC45A2-AMACR fusion proved highly aggressive. Identification of the signaling pathways of this chimeric protein may gain critical insight into the behavior of prostate cancer.",
                                "Even though the prevalence of each fusion transcript in prostate cancer samples is low (ranging from 2.9% to 7.9%), up to 60% of prostate cancers that later recurred and had short PSADT were positive for at least one of these fusion transcripts. The specificity of these fusion transcripts in predicting prostate cancer recurrence appears remarkably high, ranging from 89-100% among 4 separate prediction cohorts. There were no long term recurrence-free survivors if the primary tumor contained either TRMT11-GRIK2, MTOR-TP53BP1 or LRRC59-FLJ60017 fusion transcripts.",
                                "To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a set of fusion genes is strongly associated with poor prognosis of prostate cancer. This discovery may have salient impact on clinical practice in light of the limit of serum PSA and Gleason's grading from biopsy samples in predicting prostate cancer clinical outcome. Detection of one of these prostate cancer recurrence association fusion genes in prostate cancer sample may warrant a more aggressive treatment regimen. The fusion RNA and chimera proteins validated in this study may lay down the foundation for future molecular targeting therapy for prostate cancer patients carrying these genes."

A 158 bp PCR product was generated. The PCR product was subsequently sequenced. PTEN-NOLC1 fusion transcript was confirmed (FIG. 13A). To investigate the mechanism of PTEN-NOLC1 fusion transcript, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridizations (FISH) were performed using probes corresponding to 5\u2032-end of PTEN genome (RP11-124B18) and 3\u2032-end of NOLC1 genome (CTD-3082D22), respectively. In normal prostate epithelial cells, these 2 probes were hybridized to distinct separate locations in the genome due to more than 14 megabase separation of these 2 genes (FIG. 13B). In contrast, these two signals appeared to merge to generate an overlapped signal in prostate cancer genome from a sample that is positive for PTEN-NOLC1 fusion transcript. Interestingly, non-fusion PTEN was virtually undetectable in this prostate cancer sample, suggesting that PTEN-NOLC1 fusion was accompanied with PTEN deletion in another allele. These results suggest that genome rearrangement is the underlying mechanism for PTEN-NOLC1 transcription. To investigate the clinical significance of PTEN-NOLC1 fusion, 215 prostate cancer samples were analyzed for PTEN-NOLC1 expression. Over 14% (31/215) prostate cancer samples were found to express PTEN-NOLC1 (FIG. 13C). Among the positive samples, 77% (24/31, p=0.03) patients experienced prostate cancer recurrence. This indicates that PTEN-NOLC1 fusion is associated with poor clinical outcome. Interestingly, our analysis of lung adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma multiforme, and hepatocellular carcinoma indicates that significant number of these cancers are also positive for PTEN-NOLC1 fusion: 35/38 glioblastoma multiformis, 3/20 hepatocellular carcinoma and 29/40 lung adenocarcinoma. These results suggest that PTEN-NOLC1 fusion may have broad implication for cancer development.",

Subsequently, we transfected NIH3T3 and PC3 cells (a human prostate cancer cell line) with pCDNA4-PTEN-NOLC1-FLAG/pCDNA6. As shown in FIG. 27B, induction of NIH3T3 and PC3 cells produces 10.3 (p<0.01) and 3.1 fold (p<0.01) increase of cell growth, respectively.

                                "MAN2A1-FER was present in prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and Glioblastoma multiforme. MAN2A1 is a Golgi enzyme required for conversion of high mannose to complex type structure of N-glycan for mature glycosylation of a membrane protein1,2. Little is known about its relation with human malignancies. On the other hand, FER, a tyrosine kinase, is a well-documented oncogene3, 4. Several studies showed that FER activate androgen receptor (AR) by phosphorylating Tyr223 in AR5, and is essential for NF\u03baB activation of EGFR6. Some studies indicate that FER is an essential component of stem cell tyrosine kinase 1 (STK1)6 and mast cell growth factor receptor (kit)7,8 signaling. Over-expression of FER is associated with poor clinical outcomes of breast cancer9, renal cell carcinoma10, 11, non-small cell lung cancer12,13 and hepatocellular carcinoma14. The N-termini of many tyrosine protein kinases serve to constrain the kinase activity and are regulated by other molecules. Domains of some N-termini bind and select specific targets for the kinases. Removal of the N-terminus from a protein kinase may produce constitutively activated kinase activity that may alter the signaling pathways and generates uninhibited cell growth. The best analogy to MAN2A1-FER is BCR-Abl. When c-Abl is intact, its kinase activity is constrained. Removal of SH3 domain in c-Abl in the BCR-Abl fusion protein converts the mutant Abl tyrosine kinase into an oncogene that plays key role in developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Wild type FER with intact SH2 domain is inactive in kinase activity when assayed in cell free system. In the fusion gene MAN2A1-FER, the N-terminus of FER suffers a loss of SH2 and FHC domain (FIG. 14). These domains were replaced with glycoside hydrolase and \u03b1-mannosidase middle domain from MAN2A1. As a result, the kinase activity may be activated and substrate targets of FER tyrosine kinase may be altered.",

                                "To investigate whether MAN2A1-FER chimera protein is expressed in prostate cancer samples that contain MAN2A1-FER transcript, protein extracts from 5 prostate cancer samples positive for MAN2A1-FER RNA were analyzed using antibodies specific for MAN2A1 or FER. These results showed that the samples expressed a 115 Kd protein recognized by both MAN2A1 and FER antibodies (FIG. 22). This protein is not detected in prostate cancer samples that are negative for MAN2A1-FER transcript.",
                                "When MAN2A1-FER was forced to express in RWPE1 cells, a non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, it increase the proportion of cells in S phase by 4.6-5 fold (p<0.001). MAN2A1-FER was determined to be co-localized with Golgi protein in both immunofluorescence and sucrose gradient analysis, supporting the notion that MAN2A1-FER is primarily located in Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, expression of MAN2A1-FER increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in RWPE1 cells in the absence of EGFR ligand, suggesting that MAN2A1-FER may ectopically phosphorylate the EGFR extracellular domain. Thus, MAN2A1-FER may function as a transforming oncogene and possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity derived from its FER kinase domain. Not to be limited to any particular theory, the kinase domain of MAN2A1-FER may be the driver of its oncogenic activity through ectopic phosphorylation of transmembrane proteins such as EGFR.",

                                "Based on the analyses above, we reason that the altered subcellular location and substrate specificity of FER kinase will create oncogenic activity of MAN2A1-FER. A large part of this oncogenic activity results from ectopic phosphorylation and activation of EGFR and its down-stream signaling pathways. Thus, we can intervene and disrupt the oncogenic pathways of MAN2A1-FER using 2 different approaches. The first approach is inhibiting the kinase activity of MAN2A1-FER by targeting MAN2A1-FER proteins using small molecules that can inhibit tyrosine kinase. Several small molecules specific for FER such as diaminopyrimidine TAE684, and pyrazologyrididines WZ-4-49-8 and WZ-4-49-10, generic ALK/FER inhibitor crisotinib are available. Among these compound inhibitors, Crisotinib has been approved by FDA to treat advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer positive for EML4-ALK, another tyrosine kinase fusion protein. The drug has been shown to be able to shrink tumor mass by at least 30% in most patients.",
                                "To investigate whether Crisotinib is also effective against MAN2A1-FER positive cancer cells, we transformed human prostate cancer cell line PC3 with pCDNA4-MAN2A1-FER-FLAG/pCDNA6 to express MAN2A1-FER fusion protein. These cells were treated with low dosage of Crisotinib for 24 hours. As shown in FIG. 22, the treatment resulted in 31% cell death in MAN2A1-FER expressing cells, while it hardly killed the same type of cancer cells that do not express this fusion protein. A dosage effect analysis showed that expression of MAN2A1-FER lowers the cancer killing EC so by at least 2 magnitudes (\u02dc100 fold). Thus, it is reasonable to treat MAN2A1-FER positive prostate cancer with Crisotinib at a dosage that is not harmful to normal human cells.",
                                "The second approach is to target EGFR activation by EGFR inhibitors. These include erlotinib, cetuximab, bevacizumab, canertinib and bortezomib. Many of these drugs were FDA approved and is widely used in a variety of human solid tumors. To interrogate the effectiveness of EGFR activation interruption in treating prostate cancer, we treated MAN2A1-FER transformed PC3 cells with canertinib. As shown in FIG. 23, the treatment also produced 34% cell death of cells expressing MAN2A1-FER. In contrast, the effect on cells not expressing MAN2A1-FER (Tet\u2212) was minimal: The cell death level is similar to those untreated controls. These results suggest EGFR activation is one of the critical pathways for MAN2A1-FER oncogenic activity. Interesting, when we tried to intercept the down-streaming signaling molecule of EGFR, MEK, using an experimental drug AZD6244, the differential killing effect was largely moderated and vanished (data not shown). It suggests that other signaling pathways for EGFR may bypass MEK signaling.",

                                "Recent advances in genome editing using ZFN and CAS9 has made it possible to target a specific cancer genome sequence that is not present in normal cells. The mechanism of formation of fusion transcript is chromosome rearrangement. As a result, breakpoints in the chromosome are readily identified in a cancer genome. Normal cells do not have similar chromosome rearrangements, and are thus negative for the breakpoint. Targeting a specific breakpoint in the prostate cancer genome will likely generate an effective treatment for prostate cancer. Since the genomic breakpoint of CCNH-C5ORF30 and TMEM135-CCDC67 has been identified, genome editing technology targeting at the breakpoint of CCNH-C5orf30 or TMEM135-CCDC67 can be used to kill cancer cells.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 15, genome recombination in prostate cancer case 3T produced a breakpoint in chromosome 5 that connect intron 6 of CCNH with intron 1 of C5orf30. The resulting breaking point is unique in prostate cancer case 3T. The breakpoint is positive in most prostate cancer tissues but negative for normal tissues from this patient. A guide RNA (gRNA) of 23 bp including protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence is designed specific for the breakpoint region. The DNA sequence corresponding to this target sequence is artificially ligated into vector containing the remainder of gRNA and CAS9. This sequence is recombined and packaged into recombinant virus (Adenovirus or lenti-virus). A promoterless Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase is constructed into a shuttle vector for adenovirus along with splice tag sequence from intron/exon juncture of CCNH exon 7. A 500 bp sequence surrounding the CCNH-C5orf30 breakpoint from each side is also ligated into the shuttle vector in order to produce efficient homologous recombination to complete the donor DNA construction. The vector is recombined and packaged into AdEasy to generate recombinant viruses. These viruses are administered to patients or animals that have cancer positive for CCNH-C5orf30 fusion transcript. This leads to insertion of donor DNA into the target site (fusion breakpoint). Since HSV-1 TK in recombinant virus is promoterless, no transcription will occur if HSV-1 TK cDNA does not integrate into a transcription active genome. However, transcription of HSV-1 TK is active if HSV-1 TK is integrated into the target site of CCNH-C5orf30, since this transcript is readily detectable in the prostate cancer sample of this patient. When patient 3T takes ganciclovir or its oral homologue valganciclovir, the homologue is readily converted to triphosphate guanine analogue by HSV-1 TK and incorporated into the genomes of cancer cells. This leads to stoppage of DNA elongation in cells that are positive for CCNH-C5orf30. Since mammalian TK does not phosphorylate ganciclovir, ganciclovir is not converted to active (triphosphate) form in cells that are negative for HSV-1 TK protein. Thus, the impact of ganciclovir on normal cells is minimized.",
                                "The technique described above was applied to cells having the TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint. Since none of the fusion genes identified so far was present in prostate cancer cell lines, a TMEM135-CCDC67 genome breakpoint was created that is identical to the prostate cancer sample were analyzed. The expression of the TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint was driven by a CMV promoter. Subsequently, a donor DNA was constructed that encompassed HSV-1 TK and the splicing sites of TMEM135 exon 14. When this donor DNA was co-transfected with a vector that expresses gRNA targeting at the TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint into PC3 cells containing this genome breakpoint, integration of TK into the genome was identified (FIG. 28A). In contrast, when the same pairs of DNA were transfected into cells that do not contain the breakpoint, no integration of TK was found (data not shown). Treatment of PC3 cells without TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint has minimal cell death, while the same treatment of PC3 cells containing the breakpoint with ganciclovir resulted in 8 fold increase of cell death (FIG. 28B). This is remarkable in considering only 5-10% transfection efficiency using conventional liposome method. Without being limited to a particular theory, these data suggest that almost all the cells receiving the DNA died when treated with ganciclovir, if they contain the breakpoint. In light of this promising result, both TMEM135-CCDC67-TK cassette and NicKase-gRNATMEM135-CCDC67-BrkPt DNA are now in the process of packaging into Adenovirus. We will infect the recombinant virus into these cells in the future experiments. This will dramatically improve the delivery efficiency in the subsequent animal study and probably human."

                                "This fusion transcript was discovered in a prostate cancer sample from a patient who experienced prostate cancer recurrence 1.8 month after radical prostatectomy. The patient's pelvic lymph nodes were positive for metastatic prostate cancer, while his primary cancer sample was graded with Gleason 7. In addition to ZMPSTE24-ZMYM4, his prostate cancer sample was also positive for CCNH-c5orf30. ZMPSTE24 is a zinc-metalloproteinase involved in post-translational proteolytic cleavage that coverts farnesylated prelamin A to form mature lamin A. Mutation of this protein is associated with mandibuloacral dysplasia1. It was suggested that ZMPSTE24 may be a mediator promoting invasive prostate cancer2. ZMYM4 is an anti-apoptotic gene whose function domain is located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region. Expression of ZMYM4 3\u2032 UTR has been shown to resist cell death induced by interferon \u03b3 through inhibition of AUF1 activity3. The fusion formation between ZMPSTE24 and ZMYM4 produces a truncation of 159 amino acids from the C-terminus of ZMPSTE24 and 1315 amino acids from the N-terminus of ZMYM4. Motif analysis suggests that ZMPSTE24-ZMYM4 fusion will delete about 50% of the peptidase domain from ZMPSTE24 and remove all zinc fingers from ZMYM4, but leave ZUF3504 (domain of unknown function) and apoptosis inhibitor domain intact (FIG. 17). Thus, ZMPSTE24-ZMYM4 fusion may provide cancer cells an important tool to resist program cell death.",

                                "CLTC-ETV1 was discovered in a prostate cancer sample that has Gleason's grade of 7. The patient experienced prostate cancer recurrence 22 months after radical prostatectomy, and had been rapidly progressing. In addition to CLTC-ETV1, the prostate cancer sample was also positive for TRMT11-GRIK2 fusion. CLTC is a major protein component of coated vesicles and coated pits, and is universally expressed. Its presence is essential for cell shape formation and cell motility. ETV1 is a transcription factor that was shown to over-express in prostate cancer. ETV1 had been shown to partner at least 12 different head genes in prostate cancer and Ewing's sarcoma4,5. However, most of these fusions do not produce a functional transcription factor from ETV1 due to frameshift in the fusion or few amino acids left after the fusion. In contrary, CLTC-ETV1 fusion preserves a largely intact transcription domain in ETV1, and probably represents the first example of potential functional ETV1 fusion in prostate cancer. CLTC-ETV1 fusion deletes 3 clathrin domains from CLTC (FIG. 18). This may impair the function of CLTC for coated pit formation. ETV1 has been shown to be oncogenic in several organ systems6-8. The regulatory domain is located in the N-terminus. The regulatory domain contains MAPK phosphorylation site as well as ubiquitination site by COP19,10. Truncation in the N-terminus of ETV1 eliminates all these regulatory elements from ETV1. Thus, the protein level CLTC-ETV1 may be increased due to less degradation and activity of ETV1 may become constitutive due to the lack of regulatory constraint in the fusion protein. Since ETV1 has been shown to overexpress in many prostate cancers, CLTC-ETV1 fusion might be the underlying mechanism.",

                                "The ACPP-SEC13 fusion transcript was discovered in a prostate cancer sample from patients who experienced recurrence but also had a slow rise of PSA with doubling time more than 20 months. The Gleason's grade is 7. The pathological examination reveals invasion into seminal vesicle by prostate cancer cells. ACPP is prostate specific acid phosphatase and is abundantly expressed in prostate acinar cells, while SEC13 belongs to the family of WD-repeat proteins, and is required for vesicle biogenesis from endoplasmic reticulum11. Recent studies suggest that SEC13 is a subunit of GATOR2, an octomeric GTPase activating protein. Inhibition of SEC13 suppresses mTOR activation12. In ACPP-SEC13 fusion, only the N-terminus 72 amino acids of ACPP is preserved, and over \u2154 of the phosphatase domain is truncated, while SEC13 loses 196 amino acids from its N-terminus and has 3 WD-repeat domains deleted (FIG. 19). Due to the large truncation of critical domains in both proteins, it is expected that ACPP-SEC13 contains neither phosphatase nor GTPase-activation activity. Such loss of function may lead to hyperactivity of mTOR and may make it insensitive to amino acid deprivation. A potential targeted treatment for patients positive for ACPP-SEC13 might be using mTOR inhibitor since cancer cells may become hypersensitive to mTOR inhibitors when SEC13 is not functional.",

However, the rise of PSA appeared rapid with PSADT less than 3 months. The prostate cancer Gleason's grade was 7, and there was no invasion into seminal vesicle or other adjacent organs at the time of surgery. The surgical margin was negative. It clearly suggests that some prostate cancer cells had escaped the primary location before the surgery. DOCK7 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involving in migration and cell polarization13,14, while OLR1 is a low density lipoprotein receptor that belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily. OLR1 binds, internalizes and degrades oxidized low-density lipoprotein15. Unlike the above 3 fusion transcripts, DOCK7-OLR1 does not produce a chimera protein. Instead, separate translation of DOCK7 and OLR1 occurs from the fusion transcript. The fusion deleted a significant portion of cytokinesis domain of DOCK7 such that motility regulation by DOCK7 might be compromised. However, the fusion transcript will produce an intact OLR1 protein (FIG. 20). OLR1 was implicated in Fas-mediated apoptosis. The functional significance of its expression under the control of DOCK7 promoter is to be investigated.",

                                "PCMTD1-SNTG1 fusion transcript was discovered in a prostate cancer sample from a patient who experienced recurrent prostate cancer 5.5 months after the radical prostatectomy. The rise of PSA was rapid with PSADT less than 3 months. The Gleason's grade is 9. Seminal vesicle invasion was identified in the prostatectomy sample. The prostate cancer sample is also positive for SLC45A2-AMACR and LRRC59-FLJ60017. PCMTD1 is Daspartate methyltransferase domain containing protein. The function of PCMTD1 has not been studied. SNTG1 is a member of the syntrophin family. SNTG1 belongs to peripheral membrane protein. Recent study suggests that SNTG1 may regulate diacylglycerol kinase zeta subcellular localization and regulates the termination of diacylglycerol signaling. Similar to DOCK7-OLR1 fusion, PCMTD1-SNTG1 fusion does not produce a chimera protein. PCMTD1-SNTG1 fusion produces a truncated PCMTD1. The truncation removes half of the methyl-transferase domain of PCMTD1. However, SNTG1 is intact (FIG. 21). Since diacylglycerol kinase weakens protein kinase C activity by depleting the availability of diacylglycerol, higher level of SNTG1 might enhance PKC signaling If PCMDT1-SNTG1 fusion drives up the expression of SNTG1. Alternatively, impairing the function of PCMTD1 may have impact on cell metabolism and cell growth that are yet to be delineated.",

SLC45A2 is a transporter protein known to be overexpressed in melanoma1, while AMACR is an enzyme involved in metabolism of branch fatty acid, and is known for its overexpression in several human malignancies. SLC45A2-AMACR replaces 5 transmembrane and cytosolic domains of SLC45A2 with an intact racemase domain from AMACR2, while leaves the extracellular and the N-terminal transmembrane domains intact (FIG. 24). Most of prostate cancer patients who were positive for SLC45A2-AMACR experienced prostate cancer recurrence within 5 years of surgical treatment. Previous studies suggest that AMACR is essential for optimal growth of prostate cancer cells in vivo. Knocking down of AMACR or treatment of prostate cancer with AMACR inhibitors resulted in death of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo3. Formation of SLC45A2-AMACR generates ectopic racemase for fatty acid metabolism to support the growth of prostate cancer cells.",

                                "To investigate whether SLC45A2-AMACR chimera protein is expressed in prostate cancer samples that contain SLC45A2-AMACR transcript, protein extracts from 4 prostate cancer samples positive for SLC45A2-AMACR RNA were analyzed using antibodies specific for MAN2A1 or FER. The results showed that these samples expressed a 50 Kd protein recognized by both MAN2A1 and FER antibodies (FIG. 25A). This protein was not detected in prostate cancer samples that were negative for SLC45A2-AMACR transcript. When SLC45A2-AMACR was forced to express in RWPE1 cells, a non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line, it increased the proportion of cells in S phase by an average of 8.7 fold (p<0.001). MTT assays showed a 7.5 fold increase of cell proliferation (p<0.001)(FIG. 25 E-F). SLC45A2-AMACR was determined to be localized in the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence staining and membranous fractionation analyses. This is in contrast to native AMACR, which is located primarily in the mitochondria/cytoplasm. To investigate what are the potential signaling molecules mediating SLC45A2-AMACR induced cell growth and DNA synthesis. Yeast-two hybrid screening of prostate Yeast two-Hybrid library using pBD-SLC45A2-AMACR was performed. After 3 rounds of metabolic screening, 15 unique clones that contain SLC45A2-AMACR binding proteins were identified. One of these clones encodes inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1 (INPPL1, also called SHIP2). SHIP2 is a SH2 domain containing inositol phosphatase that converts PIP3(3,4,5) to PIP2(3,4). In contrast to Pten, which converts PIP3(3,4,5) to an inactive PIP2(4,5), PIP2(3,4) generated by SHIP2 has higher affinity binding with AKT than PIP3(3,4,5), and thus hyper-activate AKT pathway. The interaction between SLC45A2 and SHIP2 was validated by both yeast Two-hybrid co-transfection analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays in SLC45A2-AMACR expressing cells (FIG. 25G-H). Induction of SLC45A2-AMACR expression in 2 different clones of RWPE1 cells generated 2.1- and 2.3-fold higher level of PIP2(3,4), respectively. These results indicate that binding of SLC45A2-AMACR and SHIP2 leads to activation of SHIP2 phosphatase activity and probably AKT signaling pathway.",

                                "To investigate whether targeting SLC45A2-AMACR is a viable approach to treat prostate cancer, we chose 2 approaches: 1) To intercept SLC45A2-AMACR/SHIP2-Akt pathway with small molecules; and 2) to block the ectopic racemase activity of SLC45A2-AMACR with ebselen or trifluoro-ibuprofen. Surprisingly, both SHIP2 and MTOR inhibitors killed PC3 cells effectively, regardless whether they were transformed with SLC45A2-AMACR. Expression of SLC45A2-AMACR only moderately sensitized PC3 cells to Rapamycin. This is probably due to Pten negative status of PC3 cells such that Akt pathway is fully activated regardless the presence of SLC45A2-AMACR. On the other hand, when we applied ebselen, the potent inhibitor of racemase of AMACR, to SLC45A2-AMACR expressing PC3 cells, 5 fold higher sensitivity of cell growth inhibition was found for PC3 cells transformed with pCDNA4-SLC45A2-AMACR-FLAG/pCDNA6 over the controls. In contrast, non-transformed RWPE1 cells and NIH3T3 cells that expressed little AMACR was largely insensitive to ebselen killing (FIG. 26). The differential sensitivity of normal cells versus cancer cells to AMACR inhibitors may prove very useful in treating prostate cancer positive for this fusion gene.",

The mortality of prostate cancer reached 27,540 in 2014, the second most lethal cancer for men.1 Treatment of prostate cancer, particularly of those metastatic prostate cancers remains problematic. As described above, a panel of fusion genes that are present in most prostate cancers have been shown to be recurrent and lethal.2 The mechanism of these fusions is chromosome rearrangement. The expressions of these fusion genes are wide-spread among aggressive prostate cancers but are absent in normal tissues. Thus, targeting at these chromosome rearrangement breakpoints that create these fusion genes would provide a highly cancer specific approach to treat prostate cancers.",

                                "One of the fusion genes discovered in prostate cancer is between transmembrane protein 135 (TMEM135) and coiled-coil domain containing 67 (CCDC67). The fusion gene was created due to a 6 MB deletion in the region of chromosome 11q14.2-21. The deletion joins intron 13 of TMEM135 with intron 9 of CCDC67 in chromosome 11 (FIG. 29A). Such sequence joining creates a unique sequence breakpoint not present in normal tissues. This provides a unique target in cancer cells for therapeutic intervention. To target at this joining sequence, 2 gRNAs were designed to complement to the regions flanking the chromosomal breakpoint (FIG. 29B). These gRNAs and Cas9D10A were ligated into VQAd5-CMV shuttle vector and recombined into pAD5 adenovirus to create pAD5-cas9D10A-gRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9. To provide a potential lethal gene for targeted cancer cells, cDNA of HSV-1 tk was ligated with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) cDNA in frame to create a chimeric gene EGFP-tk. The chimeric cDNA is promoterless, and was ligated with 584 bp of intron 13 sequence of TMEM135 at the 5\u2032 end and 561 bp of intron 9 sequence of CCDC67 at the 3\u2032 end. These sequences were subsequently ligated into PAdlox shuttle vector and recombined into adenovirus to create pADTMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9. Such device is intended to produce single strand breaks at intron 13 of TMEM135 and intron 9 of CCDC67 in close proximity to the chromosome breakpoint and in different strands.",
                                "To examine whether the designed gRNA is adequate in recruiting Cas9 to produce DNA break at the targeted DNA, in vitro cleavage assays were performed on pCMV-TMEM135int13-CCDC67int9, using recombinant Cas9 from S. pyogenes and gRNA generated from in vitro transcription. As shown in FIG. 30A, both gRNA\u2212 and gRNA+ cleaved the linearized pCMVTMEM135int13-CCDC67int9 at the correct locations and generated the expected 4317 and 3206 bp fragments for gRNA\u2212, and 4414 and 3109 bp for gRNA+. To test whether pAD5-Cas9D10AgRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9 and pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9 induced integration of EGFP-tk into the TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint of the cancer genome, prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 were transfected with pCMV-TMEM135int13-CCDC67int9 such that the integrated vector would transcribe a RNA containing TMEM133-CCDC67 breakpoint under CMV 1E94 promoter (FIG. 30B). When PC3 cells stably expressing TMEM133-CCDC67 breakpoint RNA were infected with pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9 and pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9, intensive EGFP-tk expression was identified in cells (green fluorescence) that also expressed Cas9D10A-RFP (red fluorescence), while little EGFP-tk expression was found in cells that had minimal Cas9D10A-RFP expression (FIGS. 30C and D, Table 19), suggesting that the integration of EGFP-tk into the genome and the expression of EGFP-tk protein are dependent on Cas9D10A-RFP. Similar finding was also observed in DU145 cells transformed with pCMV-TMEM135int13-CCDC67int9. In contrast, neither PC3 nor DU145 cells transformed with pCMVscript displayed significant expression of EGFP-tk (FIGS. 30C and D, Table 19), suggesting that no integration of EGFP-tk occurred when TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint was absent. These results indicate that integration of EGFP-tk into the breakpoint of TMEM135-CCDC67 using Cas9D10A is highly specific. Few off-target events occurred.",
                                "Nucleotide homologues, such as guanine analogue 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (ganciclovir)20, is converted to triphosphates form by HSV-1 tk but not by its mammalian counterpart. Ganciclovir triphosphates blocks DNA synthesis. To examine whether cancer cells expressing EGFP-tk are susceptible to anti-Herpes drug such as ganciclovir, PC3 or DU145 cells expressing TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint were infected with pAD5-Cas9D10AgRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9 and pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9. These cells were exposed to various concentrations of ganciclovir. As shown in FIG. 31A, at 0.075 \u03bcg/ml of ganciclovir, the killing of PC3 or DU145 cells reached 50% of its maximal level, and at 5 \u03bcg/ml, the killing was at the peak. At 5 \u03bcg/ml of ganciclovir, apoptosis of PC3 or DU145 cells containing the TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint and infected with pAD5-Cas9D10AgRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9 and pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9 was clearly visualized (FIG. 31B and Table 20). No significant cell deaths were identified for cells containing no TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint, even though they were equally infected with these viruses and exposed to high concentrations of ganciclovir (up to 100 \u03bcg/ml, FIGS. 31A and B). These findings indicate that the killing of cancer cells by ganciclovir is breakpoint dependent and is highly specific.",
                                "To examine whether such breakpoint dependent killing of cancer cells can be used as a treatment for cancer, PC3 or DU145 cells containing TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint were xenografted into the subcutaneous regions of severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The xenografted tumors were allowed to grow for 3 weeks to reach \u02dc0.7 cm3 in size. These mice were then infected with pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9 and pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9 (5\u00d71010 pfu), and treated with ganciclovir (80 mg/kg). As shown in FIG. 32A, mice xenografted with PC3 or DU145 cancer cells containing TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint experienced exponential growth of tumor if they were not treated properly. In contrast, if these tumors were treated with both viruses and ganciclovir, the mice experienced up to 30% shrinking of the tumor volumes. Integration of TMEM123int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9 and expression of EGFP-tk were detected in PC3 or DU145 cells that contained TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint and treated with recombinant viruses (FIG. 33). There was no incidence of metastasis detected in mice treated with pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9, pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9 and ganciclovir. However, PC3 or DU145 cells containing no TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint had 33-50% metastasis rate even treated with the recombinant viruses and ganciclovir (FIG. 32B). Mice xenografted with PC3 or DU145 cells that contain TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint and treated with the recombinant viruses and ganciclovir had no mortality, while all control treated mice died within 7 weeks of tumor cells xenografting (FIG. 32C). These experiments suggest that targeting fusion gene breakpoint in the cancer genome is an effective and highly specific approach to treat cancer.",

                                "Chromosome rearrangement and deletion creates many cancer specific fusion genes.21 These fusion genes either acquire additional function to drive the cancer progression or destroy genes that block the progression of cancer. TMEM135-CCDC7 is an example of latter such that the fusion eliminates the open-reading frame of CCDC67, a putative cancer suppressor and truncates 65 amino acids off the C-terminus of TMEM135, a protein widely expressed in most tissues but with unknown function. The impact of fusion genes on the function of genes that are involved is probably more dramatic than most missense point mutations. The fusion genes created in cancers represent a new stratum of novel functions developed by cancer cells. The presence of chromosome rearrangement-based fusion genes is the hallmark of human malignancies. As a result, targeting at fusion genes created by cancer cells will generate highly specific cancer cell killing but will spare the destruction of normal cells that do not contain the chromosome rearrangement.",
                                "The recent advances in precision cleavage of DNA by bacterial CRISPR/Cas system made it possible to target specific genome sequence with relatively high efficiency. The approach described herein appears highly specific, with average functional off-target rates being 1.3% in both PC3 and DU145 cells (EGFP-tk+ cells/Cas9D10A-RFP+ cells in PC3+pCMV or DU145+pCMV cells, Table 18). Such precision specificity makes it possible to apply this approach to a clinical setting.",
                                "The current therapeutic approach to metastatic prostate cancer heavily relies on intervention of androgen receptor signaling pathway. However, such approach invariably leads to drug tolerance and refractory to drug treatment as cancer genome adjusts its gene expression pattern and develops new pathways to bypass the signaling blockade. The subsequent application of chemotherapy to androgen refractory prostate cancer may impact both cancer and normal tissues, and thus generally produces poor therapeutic outcomes. The genome approach may have significant advantage over chemotherapy because of its specificity for the cancer genome sequence. There is no appreciable cytotoxic side-effect of these recombinant viruses in either cell culture or animal model. The integration of EGFP-tk can be monitored by fluorescence imaging.",
                                "Furthermore, in the event of unwanted integration into the genome of healthy cells of critical location, the integrated EGFP-tk can be retrieved by Cre expression. In light of the toxic side-effect of small molecules targeting at protein molecules, genome therapeutic approach shown in this report may represent a more controlled, safe and probably minimal side-effect approach to treat human cancers.",
