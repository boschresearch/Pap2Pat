    "abstract": "The invention provides a conjugate of a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule. The conjugate is typically made by (a) oxidising a primary hydroxyl group in the capsular polysaccharide, to give an oxidised polysaccharide with an aldehyde group; and (b) coupling the oxidised polysaccharide to a carrier molecule via the aldehyde group, thereby giving the conjugate. The conjugate may be part of an immunogenic composition. This composition may comprise one or more further antigens, particularly capsular polysaccharides from serogroups A, W135, C and Y and conjugated forms thereof. The composition may be in an aqueous formulation. The composition is useful as a vaccine, e.g. for raising an immune response in a mammal. The invention also provides processes for making the conjugate.",

                        "The capsular saccharides of bacteria have been used for many years in vaccines against capsulated bacteria. As saccharides arc T-independent antigens, however, they arc poorly immunogenic. Conjugation to a carrier can convert T-independent antigens into T-dependent antigens, thereby enhancing memory responses and allowing protective immunity to develop. The most effective saccharide vaccines are therefore based on glycoconjugates, and the prototype conjugate vaccine was against Haemophilus influenzae type b (\u2018Hib\u2019) [e.g. see chapter 14 of ref. 86].",
                        "Based on the organism's capsular polysaccharide, twelve serogroups of N. meningitidis have been identified (A, B, C, H, I, K, L, 29E, W135, X, Y and Z). Group A is the pathogen most often implicated in epidemic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Serogroups B and C arc responsible for the vast majority of cases in USA and in most developed countries. Serogroups W135 and Y are responsible for the remaining cases in USA and developed countries. A tetravalent vaccine of capsular polysaccharides from serogroups A, C, Y and W135 has been known for many years [1,2]. Although effective in adolescents and adults, it induces a poor immune response and short duration of protection and cannot be used in infants [e.g. ref. 3] because polysaccharides are T cell-independent antigens that induce a weak immune response which cannot be boosted. The polysaccharides in this vaccine are not conjugated [4]. Conjugate vaccines against serogroup C have been approved for human use, and include Menjugate\u2122 [5], MeningitecTM and NeisVac-C\u2122. Mixtures of conjugates from serogroups A+C are known [6-8] and mixtures of conjugates from serogroups A+C+W135+Y have been reported [9-13].",
                        "The structure of the group X capsular polysaccharide has been known since the 1970s [14] and this serogroup has been associated with a number of outbreaks of meningococcal disease, e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa and China [15,16]. Serogroup X is known to have a significantly higher attack rate than serogroup A among children below 5 years of age. Although the need for a vaccine against this serogroup has been recognised for many years [17], no effective vaccine has been developed. Conjugate vaccines against serogroup X have been proposed [17,18], but it remains unknown whether such conjugates would be immunogenic or protective against this serogroup.",
                        "Accordingly, there remains a need for conjugates of scrogroup X capsular polysaccharides. Moreover, there remains a need for conjugates that can be used for vaccination against diseases caused by this serogroup.",
                        "The structure of the group X capsular polysaccharide consists of N-acetylglucosamine-4-phosphate residues held together by \u03b11-4 phosphodiester bonds without O-acetyl groups [19]: {\u21924)-D-GlcpNAc-\u03b1-(1\u2192OPO3\u2192} (FIG. 1). Based on the similarity between their structures, a biosynthetic relationship between MenA and MenX capsular polysaccharides has been postulated [14]. MenA capsular polysaccharide tends to hydrolyse significantly in aqueous solution [20]. This instability is thought to be caused by the presence of a phosphodiester linkage involving the anomeric position and of the N-Acetyl group in position 2 of mannosamine, which can assist departure of a phosphomonoester group [21]. Another possibility is that the hydroxyl groups at position 4 of the N-acetylmannosamine subunits interact with the phosphodiester groups facilitating hydrolysis via an internal participation mechanism, as seen in the capsular polysaccharide of type 6A pneumococcus [22] and Haemophilus influenzae type b [23]. The similarity in the structures of the MenX and MenA capsular polysaccharides, particularly their common anomeric phosphodiester linkage, means that the MenX polysaccharide may suffer from similar stability problems when in aqueous solution. The intrinsic instability of the MenA capsular polysaccharide in aqueous solution means that it is often presented in a lyophilized form when contained in vaccines (e.g. in the polysaccharide vaccine Mencevax\u2122 and the conjugate vaccines MenAfriVac\u2122, Menveo\u2122 and Nimenrix\u2122). Although the MenX capsular polysaccharide could similarly be presented in a lyophilised form to improve its stability, an aqueous formulation would be more convenient. The only vaccine containing a MenA capsular polysaccharide conjugate in an aqueous formulation is Menactra\u2122, but this vaccine requires storage at low temperatures. Such cold storage is expensive and presents practical difficulties in many of the countries where MenA and MenX outbreaks are common (e.g. sub-Saharan Africa).",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need for aqueous formulations of serogroup X capsular polysaccharides and conjugates thereof, particularly aqueous formulations that do not require refrigeration.",
                        "The development of a vaccine against MenX requires a method for polysaccharide quantification that can be used as an in-process assay and/or for the characterization of the final vaccine. The presence of phosphate groups in the MenX capsular polysaccharide means that the polysaccharide can be quantified by a colorimetric method that measures total phosphorus content [24]. However, this method lacks selectivity and therefore would not be suitable for certain in-process applications, e.g. for the analysis of polysaccharide in phosphate buffers or in the presence of phosphate-containing impurities. A more selective method would be NMR, which has been proposed already for MenX polysaccharide quantification [25]. However, this approach requires pure samples and a large amount of material. Reference 26 demonstrates an alternative approach, where the MenX polysaccharide is quantified by HPAEC-PAD, which is more sensitive than NMR and more selective than measuring phosphate content. The authors of ref 26 quantified the MenX polysaccharide by hydrolysing the sample to make glucosamine, and comparing the amount of glucosamine released against a calibration curve derived from an N-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate quantitative standard. However, glucosamine may be present because of contamination, leading to inaccurate results. Accordingly, there is a need for alternative or improved methods for assaying the MenX polysaccharide, and in particular for methods that are more selective for MenX."

                        "The invention is based in part on methods for conjugating a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide to a carrier molecule. The inventors have found that the resulting conjugates are immunogenic and capable of inducing a bactericidal antibody response. Serogroup X conjugates are therefore useful in immunogenic compositions, and in particular in vaccines. The inventors have also discovered that it is possible to combine serogroup X capsular polysaccharide antigens, e.g. serogroup X conjugates, with other antigens without losing the immune response to serogroup X. In particular, serogroup X conjugates may be combined with other conjugates, e.g. conjugates comprising other bacterial capsular saccharide antigens. Serogroup X conjugates are particularly suitable for combination with conjugates comprising capsular saccharide antigens from other N. meningilidis serogroups, e.g. serogroups A, C, W135 and Y. In these combinations, not only does the serogroup X conjugate retain its immunogenicity, but the serogroup A, C, W135 and/or Y conjugates also retain their immunogenicity. Furthermore, the inventors have also found that despite its structural similarity to the serogroup A capsular polysaccharide, the capsular polysaccharide from serogroup X is surprisingly stable in solution. Serogroup X capsular polysaccharides and conjugates thereof may therefore be particularly suitable for use in aqueous formulations.",
                        "In a first aspect, the invention provides a conjugate of a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule. The inventors have found that particularly stable conjugates of a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule may be made using the process of the first embodiment of the second aspect of the invention described below. For example, the conjugates may contain less than 50% free saccharide after 28 days at 37\u00b0 C. The % free saccharide may be determined as described in Stability study (2) below. Accordingly, within the first aspect of the invention, the invention provides a conjugate of a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule comprising less than 50% free saccharide after 28 days at 37\u00b0 C. The conjugate may in particular comprise less than 25% free saccharide, particularly less than 20% free saccharide and more particularly less than 15% free saccharide, e.g. about 10% free saccharide.",
                        "In a second aspect, the invention provides processes for preparing a conjugate of a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule, in particular the processes of the first, second and third embodiments described below. The second aspect also provides the process of the fourth embodiment described below. The conjugate of the first aspect of the invention is typically obtained or obtainable by one of these processes. However, the conjugate of the first aspect may alternatively be made by any suitable method. When the conjugate of the invention is made by one of these other methods, the method typically does not involve one or both of the following steps: a) coupling the polysaccharide to a linker, to form a polysaccharide-linker intermediate in which the free terminus of the linker is an ester group, particularly wherein the coupling takes place indirectly, i.e. with an additional linker that is used to derivatise the polysaccharide prior to coupling to the linker; and b) reductive amination by reacting a carbonyl group at the reducing terminus of the polysaccharide with a primary amine group at one terminus of a linker.",
                        "In a third aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide, particularly in the form of a conjugate of the first aspect of the invention, and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition is typically in an aqueous formulation.",
                        "In other aspects, the invention provides intermediates that are useful in the processes of the invention and processes for preparing these intermediates. The invention also provides uses of the conjugate of the invention, e.g. within immunogenic compositions and, in particular, vaccines, and for raising an immune response in a mammal.",
                        "In a first embodiment of the second aspect of the invention, the invention provides a process for preparing a conjugate of a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule, comprising the steps of: (a) oxidising a primary hydroxyl group in the capsular polysaccharide, to give an oxidised polysaccharide with an aldehyde group; and (b) coupling the oxidised polysaccharide to a carrier molecule via the aldehyde group, thereby giving the conjugate. This process is thought to be particularly suitable (e.g. in terms of yield) for relatively long polysaccharides, e.g. those with a degree of polymerisation (DP) of between 20 and 200, particularly between 60 and 100 (e.g. between 70 and 90, particularly around 80). This process also contains relatively few steps, making it easier to scale-up to an industrial setting. The resulting conjugates may also be more stable, particularly compared to conjugates in which the polysaccharide is linked to the carrier via its reducing terminus. The coupling in step (b) is typically direct, e.g. by reductive amination between the aldehyde group and a primary amine group on the carrier molecule. As part of the first aspect of the invention, the invention also provides a conjugate obtained or obtainable by this process. The invention also provides the individual steps (a) and (b) of this process; and the oxidised polysaccharide intermediate obtained or obtainable by step (a) of this process.",
                        "In a second embodiment of the second aspect of the invention, the invention provides a process for preparing a conjugate of a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule, comprising the steps of: (a) reductive amination of the reducing terminus of the capsular polysaccharide, to give a modified polysaccharide with a primary amine group bonded to the C-1 atom of the terminal subunit by a covalent bond; and (b) coupling the modified polysaccharide to a carrier molecule via the primary amine group, thereby giving the conjugate. This process is particularly suitable for relatively short polysaccharides e.g. polysaccharides with a DP between 5 and 50, particularly between 10 and 20, e.g. about 15. The coupling in step (b) is typically indirect, e.g. via a linker. As part of the first aspect of the invention, the invention also provides a conjugate obtained or obtainable by this process. The invention also provides the individual steps (a) and (b) of this process; and the modified polysaccharide intermediate obtained or obtainable by step (a) of this process.",
                        "In a third embodiment of the second aspect of the invention, the invention provides a process for preparing a conjugate of a serogroup X capsular polysaccharide and a carrier molecule, comprising the steps of: (a) reduction of the reducing terminus of the capsular polysaccharide, to give a modified polysaccharide with two vicinal hydroxyl groups at that terminus; (b) oxidative cleavage of the vicinal hydroxyl groups, to give a further modified polysaccharide with an aldehyde group at the terminus; (c) reductive amination of the aldehyde group, to give a further modified polysaccharide with a primary amine group at the terminus and (d) coupling the further modified polysaccharide to a carrier molecule via the primary amine group, thereby giving the conjugate. This process may provide a better yield than the processes of the first and second embodiment, particularly for relatively short polysaccharides e.g. polysaccharides with a DP between 5 and 50, particularly between 10 and 20, e.g. about 15. The coupling in step (d) is typically indirect, e.g. via a linker. As part of the first aspect of the invention, the invention also provides a conjugate obtained or obtainable by this process. The invention also provides the individual steps (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this process and the combinations of steps (a) and (b), (b) and (c), (c) and (d), (a), (b) and (c) and (b), (c) and (d); and the modified polysaccharide intermediates obtained or obtainable by steps (a), (b) or (c) of this process.",

                        "The inventors have also developed a method for assaying serogroup X capsular polysaccharide. The method involves the detection of glucosamine-4-phosphate, which is characteristic of the MenX polysaccharide and not usually present in impurities. Accordingly, in a yet further aspect, the invention provides a method for assaying a sample suspected to contain serogroup X capsular polysaccharide, comprising the steps of: (i) hydrolysing any serogroup X capsular polysaccharide in the sample, to give a hydrolysate; (ii) subjecting the hydrolysate to liquid chromatography; and (iii) detecting any glucosamine-4-phosphate separated in step (ii).",
                        "In a further aspect, the invention provides processes and reagents useful for preparing N-acetylglucosamine-4-phosphate. This compound may be used as an analytical standard in the method for assaying serogroup X capsular polysaccharide described above.",
                        "The Capsular Polysaccharide",
                        "The invention involves the capsular polysaccharide of N. meningitidis serogroup X. The structure of the group X capsular polysaccharide consists of N-acetylglucosamine-4-phosphate residues held together by \u03b11-4 phosphodiester bonds without O-acetyl groups [19]: {\u21924)-D-GlcpNAc-\u03b1-(1\u2192OPO3\u2192} (FIG. 1).",
                        "The capsular polysaccharide can be purified by known techniques, for example by the method described in ref 19. In general, meningococcal capsular polysaccharides are prepared by a process comprising the steps of polysaccharide precipitation (e.g. using a cationic detergent), ethanol fractionation, cold phenol extraction (to remove protein) and ultracentrifugation (to remove LPS) [e.g. ref. 27]. However, a preferred process for the serogroup X capsular polysaccharide is described in ref. 10. This process involves polysaccharide precipitation followed by solubilisation of the precipitated polysaccharide using a lower alcohol. Precipitation can be achieved using a cationic detergent such as tetrabutylammonium and cetyltrimethylammonium salts (e.g. the bromide salts), or hexadimethrine bromide and myristyltrimethylammonium salts. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (\u2018CTAB\u2019) is typically used [28]. Solubilisation of the precipitated material can be achieved using a lower alcohol such as methanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methyl-propan-1-ol, 2-methyl-propan-2-ol, diols, etc., but ethanol is particularly suitable for solubilising CTAB-polysaccharide complexes. Ethanol is preferably added to the precipitated polysaccharide to give a final ethanol concentration (based on total content of ethanol and water) of between 50% and 95%.",
                        "After re-solubilisation, the polysaccharide may be further treated to remove contaminants. This is particularly important in situations where even minor contamination is not acceptable (e.g. for human vaccine production). This will typically involve one or more steps of filtration e.g. depth filtration, filtration through activated carbon may be used, size filtration and/or ultrafiltration.",
                        "Once filtered to remove contaminants, the polysaccharide may be precipitated for further treatment and/or processing. This can be conveniently achieved by exchanging cations (e.g. by the addition of calcium or sodium salts).",
                        "The invention is not limited to polysaccharides purified from natural sources, however, and the polysaccharides may be obtained by other methods, such as total or partial synthesis, e.g. by the enzymatic synthesis described in ref. 29.",
                        "The polysaccharide may be chemically modified relative to the capsular polysaccharide as found in nature. For example, the polysaccharide may be de-N-acetylated (partially or fully), N-propionated (partially or fully), etc. De-acetylation may occur before, during or after conjugation, but typically occurs before conjugation. The degree of N-acetylation of the serogroup X capsular polysaccharide used in the invention may be 0-100%, 50-100%, 75-100%, 80-100%, 90-100%, or 95-100%. Typically, the degree of N-acetylation is 100%. The degree of N-acetylation of the polysaccharide can be determined by any method known in the art, for example, by proton NMR (e.g. as described in references 30 and 31.",
                        "Capsular polysaccharides will generally be used in the form of oligosaccharides. These are conveniently formed by fragmentation of purified capsular polysaccharide (e.g. by hydrolysis), which will usually be followed by purification of the fragments of the desired size.",
                        "Fragmentation of polysaccharides is preferably performed to give a final average degree of polymerisation (DP) in the oligosaccharide of between 20 and 200, particularly between 60 and 100 (e.g. between 70 and 90, particularly around 80). The inventors have found that polysaccharides of this length are particularly suitable for use in the process of the first embodiment described above. However, the inventors have found that shorter polysaccharides may also be used, e.g. polysaccharides with a DP between 5 and 50, particularly between 10 and 20, e.g. about 15. The inventors have found that polysaccharides of this length are particularly suitable for use in the process of the second and third embodiments described above. DP can conveniently be measured by ion exchange chromatography, NMR or by colorimetric assays [32].",
                        "The polysaccharide may be sized in order to obtain a desired range of polysaccharide sizes [33]. This can be achieved in various ways, such as ultrafiltration followed by ion-exchange chromatography.",
                        "The Carrier Molecule",
                        "The invention involves the use of carrier molecules, which are typically proteins. In general, covalent conjugation of saccharides to carriers enhances the immunogenicity of saccharides as it converts them from T-independent antigens to T-dependent antigens, thus allowing priming for immunological memory. Conjugation is particularly useful for paediatric vaccines [e.g. ref. 34] and is a well known technique [e.g. reviewed in refs. 35 to 43].",
                        "Preferred carrier proteins are bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria or tetanus toxins, or toxoids or mutants thereof, particularly diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid. The inventors have found that the CRM197 diphtheria toxin mutant [44] is particularly suitable. Protein D from H. influenzae [45-47] may also be used.",

The primary hydroxyl group is bonded to the C-6 atom of a MenX capsular polysaccharide subunit by a covalent bond, such that the step proceeds as follows:",
                        "This step may involve oxidation of more than one such primary hydroxyl group, resulting in the introduction of more than one aldehyde group along the polysaccharide chain. For example, the inventors have found that suitable conjugates can be prepared by oxidising the primary hydroxyl group on between 1-50%, particularly 1-20% and more particularly 1-10%, e.g. about 4-8%, of residues within the serogroup X polysaccharide. Hydroxyl groups may be converted to aldehydes by various oxidation reactions (e.g. Swern oxidation, Dess-Martin oxidation, CrVI oxidations, etc.). However the inventors have found that the TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy radical)-mediated oxidation is particularly suitable. TEMPO-mediated oxidation is described in of ref. 67. To prevent oxidation of the aldehyde group to a carboxyl group, TEMPO-mediated oxidation is preferably carried out in non-aqueous conditions, e.g. using a DMF solvent as described in ref. 68. The skilled person would be capable of identifying suitable conditions for oxidation. For example, the inventors have found that treatment of polysaccharide with TEMPO (0.06 eq relative to the MenX repeating subunit), NaHCO3 (9 eq relative to the MenX repeating subunit) and TCC (trichloroisocyanuric acid, 2 eq relative to the MenX repeating subunit) at 0\u00b0 C. overnight is suitable.",

                        "Reductive Amination",
                        "In step (a) of the process of the second embodiment described above, the reducing terminus of the capsular polysaccharide is subjected to reductive amination to give a modified polysaccharide with a primary amine group bonded to the C-1 atom of the terminal subunit by a covalent bond:",
                        "Reductive amination is a standard technique in organic chemistry. For example, the aldehyde group at the reducing terminus may be converted into a primary amine group using ammonia. This can conveniently be achieved using an ammonium salt (e.g. ammonium chloride or ammonium acetate) in combination with an appropriate reducing agent (e.g. cyanoborohydrides, such as sodium cyanoborohydride NaBH3CN; borane-pyridine; sodium triacetoxyborohydride; borohydride exchange resin). The skilled person would be capable of identifying suitable conditions for reductive amination.",
                        "Reductive amination is also carried out in step (c) of the process of the third embodiment described above, to give a modified polysaccharide with a primary amine group at the terminus. For example, the aldehyde group may be converted into a primary amine group as described above. The reductive amination may therefore result in a modified polysaccharide with a primary amine group bonded to the C-5 atom of the terminal subunit by a covalent bond:",
                        "However, in other examples of the third embodiment, the reductive amination is between the aldehyde group and a terminal primary amine group of a linker. The linker is a bifunctional linker that provides a first terminal primary amine group for reacting with the aldehyde group and a second terminal primary amine group to act as the primary amine group at the terminus of the modified polysaccharide. For example, a bifunctional linker of the formula X1-L-X2 may be used as the linker, where X1 comprises a primary amine group that can react with the aldehyde group; X2 comprises a primary amine group; and L is a linking moiety in the linker. Typical L groups are straight chain alkyls with 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10), particularly \u2014(CH2)4\u2014. Homobifunctional linkers of the formula X-L-X are particularly suitable as the linker, where the two X groups are the same as each other; and where L is a linking moiety in the linker. A typical X group is a \u2014NHNH2 group. L typically has formula -L\u2032-L2-L\u2032-, where L\u2032 is carbonyl. Typical L2 groups are straight chain alkyls with 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10), particularly \u2014(CH2)4\u2014. A typical linker is thus adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH). Shorter linkers may also be used, e.g. carbodihydrazine (CDH, i.e. X-L-X, wherein X is \u2014NHNH2 and L is carbonyl).",
                        "Reductive amination is also carried out in step (c) of the process of the fourth embodiment described above, to give the conjugate. The reductive amination is between the aldehyde group of the further modified polysaccharide and a primary amine group on the carrier molecule.",
                        "Coupling to a Carrier Molecule",
                        "The coupling of the oxidised polysaccharide to the carrier molecule via the aldehyde group in step (b) of the first embodiment described above may be direct or via a linker. However, the coupling is preferably direct because this involves fewer synthetic steps. The coupling of the modified polysaccharide to the carrier molecule via the primary amine group in step (b) of the second embodiment described above may also be direct or via a linker. In this embodiment, a linker is typically used to provide space between the polysaccharide and the carrier molecule. The coupling of the modified polysaccharide to the carrier molecule via the primary amine group in step (d) of the third embodiment described above may also be direct or via a linker. In this embodiment, a linker is typically used, once again to provide space between the polysaccharide and the carrier molecule. For all three embodiments, any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker if desired.",
                        "Attachment of the polysaccharide or linker-derivatised polysaccharide to the carrier is typically via a primary amine (\u2014NH2) group e.g. in the side chain of a lysine or residue in a carrier protein, or of an arginine residue. Attachment to the carrier may also be via a sulphydryl (\u2014SH) group e.g. in the side chain of a cysteine residue.",
                        "For the process of the first embodiment described above, the inventors have found that direct coupling may be conveniently achieved by reacting the aldehyde group in the oxidised polysaccharide with an amine group in the carrier by reductive amination. Direct coupling of this nature is therefore preferred in this embodiment. As discussed above, reductive amination is a standard technique, and has been used extensively in the production of conjugates of capsular polysaccharides for vaccine use. In one approach, an aldehyde group in the oxidised polysaccharide reacts with an amine group in the carrier. This can conveniently be achieved by combining the polysaccharide with the carrier in the presence of an appropriate reducing agent (e.g. cyanoborohydrides, such as sodium cyanoborohydride NaBH3CN; borane-pyridine; sodium triacetoxyborohydride; borohydride exchange resin; etc.). The skilled person would be capable of identifying suitable conditions for reductive amination. For example, the inventors have found that treatment of oxidised polysaccharide with 10 mg/m1 CRM197 at a 4:1 w/w ratio and NaBH3CN at a 1:1 w/w ratio in a NaPi 10 mM pH 7.2 buffer is suitable. This mixture may be left for 72 hours with slow stirring at 37\u00b0 C. to effect the reductive amination. If desired, coupling via a linker may be used in this embodiment, e.g. by reacting the aldehyde group in the oxidised polysaccharide with an amine group in the linker by reductive amination, or by converting the aldehyde group into an amine group by reductive amination to provide an amine group for attachment of the linker.",
                        "In the processes of all embodiments, coupling via a linker may be made using any known procedure. For example, when the polysaccharide comprises an aldehyde group (e.g. the aldehyde group generated in step (a) of the process of the first embodiment described above), a bifunctional linker may be used to provide a first group for coupling to the aldehyde group and a second group for coupling to the carrier. For example, a bifunctional linker of the formula X1-L-X2 may be used, where X1 can react with the aldehyde; X2 can react with the carrier; and L is a linking moiety in the linker. A typical X1 group is an amine group. Typical L groups are straight chain alkyls with 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10) e.g. \u2014(CH2)4\u2014 or \u2014(CH2)3\u2014. Similarly, when the polysaccharide comprises a primary amine group (e.g. the primary amine group generated in step (a) of the process of the second embodiment or the primary amine group generated in step (c) of the process of the third embodiment), a bifunctional linker may be used to provide a first group for coupling to the amine group and a second group for coupling to the carrier (typically for coupling to an amine in the carrier). For example, a homobifunctional linker of the formula X-L-X may be used, where the two X groups are the same as each other and can react with the amines; and where L is a linking moiety in the linker. A typical X group is N-oxysuccinimide. L typically has formula -L\u2032-L2-L\u2032-, where L\u2032 is carbonyl. Typical L2 groups are straight chain alkyls with 1 to 10 carbon atoms (e.g. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10) e.g. \u2014(CH2)4\u2014. A typical linker is thus adipic acid N-hydroxysuccinimidc diester (SIDEA):",
                        "Other X groups are those which form esters when combined with HO-L-OH, such as norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide. Further bifunctional linkers reactive with amines for use with the invention include acryloyl halides (e.g. chloride) [70], haloacylhalides [71], disuccinimidyl glutarate, disuccinimidyl suberate, ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate], etc.",
                        "The linker will generally be added in molar excess to the polysaccharide. The linker/polysaccharide reaction will generally take place in an aprotic solvent (e.g. DMSO, ethanol acetate, etc.), as the linkers are typically insoluble in water. Where water-soluble linkers are used, however, then a wider range of solvents is available, including protic solvents such as water. Suitable linkers include sulphonated forms, such as sulphonated STDEA:",
                        "When a linker is used, the conjugate will comprise a linker moiety. This moiety originates neither in the polysaccharide nor the carrier, but is a third molecule used during conjugate preparation, and can readily be distinguished from both the polysaccharide and carrier protein in a final conjugate product. The linker moiety may include atoms such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and/or nitrogen. Linkers that comprise carbon and hydrogen are typical, and linkers that further comprise oxygen and/or nitrogen are also typically used. Linkers that include nitrogen atoms may include a carbon atom bonded to a nitrogen atom, which in turn is bonded to a second carbon atom (\u2014C\u2014N\u2014C\u2014). Linkers that include an oxygen atom typically include it as part of a carbonyl group. Linker moieties with a molecular weight of between 30-500 Da are typical. Linkers containing two carbonyl groups are also typical.",
                        "A particularly useful linker moiety is \u2014NH\u2014C(O)\u2014(CH2)n\u2014C(O)\u2014, wherein n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. The value of n is typically 4. The terminal \u2014NH\u2014 in this linker is usually attached to a carbon atom from the polysaccharide moiety. The terminal \u2014C(O)\u2014 is usually attached to a nitrogen atom in an amino acid side chain in the carrier. A preferred linker moiety can conveniently be introduced by a process involving: reaction of an \u2014NH2 group in the polysaccharide with a bifunctional linker that is a diester (e.g. a disuccinimidyl ester) of a dioic acid (e.g. of adipic acid, HOOC\u2014(CH2)4\u2014COOH); and reductive amination of the product (see FIG. 6 [69]).",

                        "Compositions of the invention may be in an aqueous formulation (i.e. solutions or suspensions) or in a dried form (e.g. lyophilised). Aqueous formulations are preferred because the inventors have found that the serogroup X capsular polysaccharide is surprisingly stable in an aqueous environment. If a dried vaccine is used then it will be reconstituted into an aqueous formulation prior to injection. Lyophilisation of conjugate vaccines is known in the art e.g. the Menjugate\u2122 product is presented in lyophilised form, whereas NeisVac-C\u2122 and Meningitec\u2122 are presented in aqueous form. To stabilise conjugates during lyophilisation, it may be typical to include a sugar alcohol (e.g. mannitol) or a disaccharide (e.g. sucrose or trehalose) e.g. at between 1 mg/ml and 30 mg/ml (e.g. about 25 mg/ml) in the composition. After reconstitution, these stabilisers may be present in the aqueous formulation.",

For example, a mixture of anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate and monobasic sodium phosphate is typical. A suitable concentration is 10 mM anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate and 10 mM monobasic sodium phosphate.

By \u2018immunologically effective amount\u2019, it is meant that the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials.",

The method of the invention is capable of quantifying very low concentrations of serogroup X capsular polysaccharide (\u22650.5 \u03bcg/ml) and is therefore suitable for assaying serogroup X capsular polysaccharide in small samples, e.g. taken in-process during a manufacturing process. The method is also specific for serogroup X capsular polysaccharide, even when impurities are present.

High levels of unconjugated polysaccharide are undesirable. A time-series of such assays can reveal if a conjugate is stable e.g. during storage.

Suitable separation techniques include selective precipitation, size-based methods, solid-phase extraction [220], etc.",

                        "The results of serogroup X capsular polysaccharide hydrolysis are analysed by liquid chromatography. Thus the methods of the invention will typically utilize a liquid chromatography column, and will involve analysing the output of such a column.",
                        "Various liquid chromatography columns can be used, but the invention will typically be used with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The invention is particularly useful for analysing the results of separation by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) or by high performance cation exchange chromatography (HPCEC). HPAEC is a common technique used for saccharide characterisation, often in combination with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) [221,222] to detect and quantify the polysaccharide. Suitable HPAEC-PAD systems are provided by Dionex\u2122 Corporation (Sunnyvale, Calif.) e.g. the BioLC\u2122 system. In these systems, the eluate from a HPAEC column is analysed using PAD i.e. based on electrical current. At suitable (high) pH, carbohydrates can be electrocatalytically oxidised at the surface of electrodes by applying a positive potential. The current generated is this way is proportional to the carbohydrate concentration, allowing detection and quantification of the carbohydrate by amperometry. Compared with simple amperometric detection, PAD intersperses short pulses of a cleaning and regeneration potential with the standard detecting potential, thereby avoiding difficulties that arise when oxidation products of analytes foul the electrodes.",
                        "Non-amperometric methods can be combined with PAD for analyzing eluates e.g. see ref. 223.",
                        "Thus the hydrolysed serogroup X capsular polysaccharide can be subjected to HPAEC for separation and the separated materials can be detected and, optionally, quantified by PAD. As shown in the examples below, HPAEC-PAD can separate hydrolysed glucosamine-4-phosphate residues from other background materials in a sample.",
                        "Preferred columns are those that spontaneously retain saccharides such that they have to be eluted from the column. Elution from the chromatography column can be an isocratic elution or a gradient elution. Eluents including hydroxide and/or acetate salts are typical eluents used during HPAEC-PAD analysis of saccharides. It is also possible, however, to use anions such as nitrate, chloride, etc. Sodium salts are typically used. For eluting analytes from AEC columns then the eluent will generally be basic e.g. the pH will be >8, >9, >10, >11, >12, >13, etc. Hydroxide salts (e.g. NaOH) can be used to achieve the desired pH.",
                        "Eluates may be subjected to chemical suppression of hydroxide ions, particularly where the ions interfere with an analytical detection technique that is being used. A micromembrane suppressor can conveniently be used, such as the MMS products from Dionex\u2122. The \u2018MMS III\u2019 product uses continuous chemical suppression to enhance analyte conductivities while decreasing eluent conductivity, and enables direct conductivity detection with ion-exchange applications using isocratic or gradient elution over wide concentration ranges.",

                        "Analytical HPAEC columns can be used in conjunction with pre-columns and/or trap columns. For instance, a PA10 analytical column can be used in conjunction with an inline PA10 guard column, and/or an inline trap (pre-treatment) column. Such columns can remove materials that would otherwise interfere with analyses e.g. an \u201cAminoTrap\u201d column can remove amino acids prior to saccharide analysis. Borate traps can also be used. TYPICAL \u201cAminoTrap\u201d resin has a 10 \u03bcm diameter substrate (ethylvinylbenzene 55% crosslinked with divinylbenzene) grafted with difunctional quaternary ammonium anion exchange sites, whereas a typical \u201cBorateTrap \u201chas a 20 \u03bcm diameter high capacity resin with very high selectivity for borate.",
                        "The PA1 and PA10 columns are both anion-exchange columns designed to be used with PAD to deliver high resolution separations of mono- and disaccharides, and the resins in both are 10 \u03bcm diameter nonporous beads covered with a fine latex of functionalized MicroBeads. Their pellicular resin structure permits excellent mass transfer, resulting in high resolution chromatography and rapid re-equilibration.

Different growths were performed in flasks and monitored by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). Culture supernatants were analyzed by NMR sequence with a diffusion filter to cut off signals deriving from lower molecular weight (MW) species and highlight the signals of higher MW scrogroup X capsular polysaccharide. Further analysis of the corresponding pellets by 1H High-Resolution Magic Angle Spinning NMR (HR-MAS NMR) in solid state did not show serogroup X capsular polysaccharide signals, indicating that the majority of the polysaccharide was released in the supernatant (considering the limit of detection of this assay, the maximum amount of polysaccharide remaining on the bacteria should be \u215b of the starting amount). Similar results were obtained with the three media.",
                        "In addition to the NMR methodology, a more accurate method for serogroup X capsular polysaccharide quantification in the clarified culture broth was developed (see below) using High-Performance Anion-Exchange Chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD). As shown in the table below, medium #3 resulted in the highest amount of polysaccharide. It was therefore selected for a higher scale (18 L) fermentation which yielded 356 \u03bcg/mL of serogroup X capsular polysaccharide in the supernatant.",

The average degree of polymerisation of the resulting oligosaccharide was determined to be 80, corresponding to a molecular weight of 25-30 kDa, by NMR. The polysaccharide depolymerization was monitored in process by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Size Exclusion Chromatography (UPLC-SEC) and phosphorus (31P) NMR spectroscopy, and it was quenched by neutralization when the desired avDP was reached. The buffer was exchanged with tetrabutyl ammonium bromide to allow dissolution of the saccharide in dimethylformamide solvent. The saccharide was then oxidized with TEMPO (0.06 eq relative to the MenX repeating subunit), NaHCO3 (9 eq relative to the MenX repeating subunit), TCC (2 eq relative to the MenX repeating subunit) at 0\u00b0 C. overnight. This oxidation generates an aldehyde group at the C-6 position of individual subunits (FIG. 3). The oxidised saccharide was purified by precipitation with acetone/NaCl and gel filtration using a Sephadex G15 column. The saccharide was quantified using HPAEC-PAD and its structural identity confirmed using NMR.

Due to the presence of O-acetyl groups at C3 and C4 of mannosamine residues, several spin systems were detected and assigned: (i) proton at C1 of 3- or 4-O-acetylated residues (H1-Pde)3/4OAc; (ii) proton at C1 of de-O-acetylated residues (H1-Pde)deOac; (iii) proton at C3 and C4 geminal of O-acetyl groups (H3/H4-Pde)3/4OAc; (iv) proton at C2 of 3-O-acetylated residues (H2-Pde)3OAc; (v) proton at C2 of 4-O-acetylated residues (H2-Pde)4OAc; (vi) proton at C2 of de-O-acetylated residues (H2-Pde)deOAc; (vii) protons at C5 and C6 of 3- or 4-O-acetylated residues (H5/6-Pde)3/4OAc; (viii) protons at C3, C4, C5 and C6 of de-O-acetylated residues (H3/4/5/6-Pde)deOAc. The attachment of phosphate at C6, confirmed by the cross peaks of phosphomonoester to proton at C6 of 3- or 4-O-acetylated residues (H6-Pme)3/4OAc and to proton at C6 of de-O-acetylated residues (H6-Pme)deOAc, indicated that during hydrolysis the phosphodiester bond is cleaved leaving a phosphate group attached to the non-reducing terminus, which is consistent with the lower stability of the phosphate-C1 linkage. Because no other 1H-31P scalar correlation was detected, no phosphate migration involving free hydroxyl groups at C4 or C3 occurred during hydrolysis. 1H-31P HMBC on the MenX oligosaccharides (FIG. 13(b)) also indicated that the phosphate-C1 linkage is less stable and in this case the non-reducing terminus has a phosphate group attached at C4: the monoester phosphate shows cross-correlation only with proton at C4. Also for MenX, no phosphate migration involving free hydroxyl groups at C3 or C6 occurred during hydrolysis. All the 31P spin systems were assigned, the phosphodiester and phosphomonoester signals at \u22121.40 and 4.65 ppm respectively. The proton NMR profile was assigned also by collecting the 31P-decoupled spectrum which reduces the peaks structure due to this scalar coupling.

Degradation of MenA and MenX capsular polysaccharides, as the consequence of hydrolysis at phosphodiester bonds, results in fragments of lower avDP which expose newly-formed phosphomonoester end groups. In NMR experiments, these phosphomonester groups generate a 31P resonance signal at higher fields than that originated by the internal phosphodiester groups thus allowing the avDP calculation as described in Stability experiments above. The variation of avDP during storage is an indicator of the polysaccharide stability and so the avDP of samples of MenA and MenX capsular polysaccharides, taken at different time points during exposure at 37\u00b0 C. and 45\u00b0 C., was measured by 31P NMR (Table 2 and FIG. 14(a)):",
