    "abstract": "A spectrometer device for analysis of aerosol particles, dusts, and other microparticles and/or nanoparticles includes an electrospray ionization source supplying a particle stream to an aerodynamic lens that focuses and collimates a beam of particles. An electrostatic trap accepts the beam of particles and traps a single trapped particle at a time in the electrostatic trap to oscillate with a measurable amplitude and frequency. A sensor senses the amplitude and frequency, and a processor determines a calculated mass to charge ratio from the amplitude and frequency of oscillation of the trapped particle in real time. A method creates a focused stream of micro or nanoparticles, traps a single particle at a time in an electrostatic trap. The amplitude and frequency of the oscillation of the trapped particle is sensed. The mass to charge ratio is determined from the amplitude and frequency of oscillation. Particles can be accelerated into a target.",

A preferred embodiment spectrometer can accelerate/decelerate a wide size range of nanoparticles, and provides new methods for measurements of fundamental aspects of particle-surface interactions that play a critical role in a wide range of complex ambient and industrial environments. An important aspect of the preferred embodiment and the invention generally is the ability to accelerate or decelerate single charged particles of a known mass to specific final velocities, as determined in real time during the analysis. Prior accelerators have been able to accelerate particles, but not with the single-particle accuracy in real time provided by spectrometers and spectrometry methods of the invention.",
                        "Preferred spectrometry methods of the invention provide a modification of the Kiefer & Jerrold single-molecule mass spectrometry approach, applying a charge-pickup electrode in an electrostatic fast-ion beam trap to monitor the ion density oscillating in the trap and carry out Fourier-transform (FT) mass spectrometry on ensembles of molecular ions.

Photoelectron-photofragment coincidence spectroscopy in a cryogenically cooled electrostatic ion beam trap. Rev Sci Instrum. 2011; 82:105105. In preferred methods of the invention, the m/z ratio of a single particle provides the information required to accelerate or decelerate that particle for analysis of particle impact. In a preferred device of the invention, the CDMS determines the m/z ratio for each particle in real time, providing the information required to accelerate or decelerate single particles over a wide range of m/z by generating the appropriate acceleration/deceleration pulsed waveform for a linear accelerator (LINAC) structure composed of a series of cylindrical electrostatic elements. Acceleration of ion ensembles is not hindered by space charge limitations since the effect of space charge is progressively reduced as the particles accelerate. Deceleration of ion ensembles does become problematic as a result of increasing space charge, and that is a benefit of working with single charged nanoparticles where this limitation is not present, which benefit is enabled by devices and methods of the invention",
                        "Preferred embodiments provide a versatile nanoparticle mass spectrometer/accelerator/decelerator. Experiments have demonstrated that an example experimental spectrometer employing polystyrene latex spheres can provide collision inelasticity on silicon wafers by determination of incident and scattered velocities in measurements of the coefficient of restitution.",

                        "A preferred embodiment spectrometer 100 is shown in FIG. 1. The spectrometer includes an enclosed electrospray ionization source 102. The electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source 102 and beam line including a desolvation tube 104 and an aerodynamics lens (ADL) 16 that focuses into a differential pumping ion optics section 108 and a quadrapole deflector QD 120, which directs an energy selected beam into a nanoparticle electrostatic trap (NET) 122 and a linear ion accelerator (LINAC) 124 that accelerates the energy selected beam into a collision target module 126 having a target and sensors. The target 126 module can have integrated sensors such a collision target that comprises a multichannel plate detector permitting particle fragmentation to be imaged using a phosphor screen an external camera. An alternative sensor is a conductive surface connected to a charge-sensitive amplifier for measuring the impact charge and charge transfer to the target. The NET 122 of a preferred experimental embodiment, and system in general, can handle a wide range of nano and microparticle sizes, with an example range being from \u02dc50 nm to \u02dc5 \u03bcm. More specifically, the quadrupole deflector (QD) 120 provides an energy selected beam of single nanoparticles for analysis in the nanoparticle electrostatic trap (NET) 122. The QD 120 can be operated over a wide energy range, selecting different particle distributions as determined by the size, charge and ESI expansion conditions. The FIG. 1 QD 120 is configured to redirect the energy selected beam orthogonally, where particles of the selected mass range are redirected to the axis of the NET 122 and other particles are not redirected. The orthogonal arrangement is not critical, and other deflectors can selectively transmit particles of a predetermined mass at various angles, including co-axially with the NET 122. In a co-axial arrangement, for example, the particles of interest would not be deflected and the particles not of interest would be deflected. Artisans will appreciate various techniques for provide a stream of size/mass selected particles to the NET 122. Various targets can be used for the collision target, e.g., silicon, diamond, molybdenum, stainless steel, silicon nitride, and molybdenium disilicide, among others. The goal of testing will determine the type of particle accelerated and the type of target impacted, as well as the phase of the particle accelerated. Example targets can include semiconductor layers or substrates to evaluate the effects that particle contamination can have during fabrication. The ESI 102 can also provide biological cells and large biological molecules and complexes in the gas phase as particles to be accelerated. The phase of particles in the NET 122 can be controlled, the particles can be heated, such as by laser energy, or cooled including to a frozen state while in the NET 122 (via refrigeration of the NET 122). In one variation, the chamber for the NET 122 includes a commercial Stirling cooler or another type of closed-cycle helium refrigerator to cool the NET 122 and freeze the particles while trapped in the NET 122. In addition to studying the particle after impact, the target can be removed after impact and tested, such as for erosion. In one variation, a sample holder for the target is rotatable, which permits grazing incidence measurements. The arrangement and control of the components in the FIG. 1 system enables determination, in real time and for a single particle, the mass-to-charge ratio, the charge, and thus the mass while the particle is trapped in the NET 122, and also the determination of the acceleration/deceleration waveform on the LINAC 124 to bring the particle to the desired velocity for impact on the collision target. The size of the particles that can be handled in the FIG. 1 devices is wide in range. An example experimental device in according with FIG. 1 required about 500 elementary charges, which sets the minimum size particle to \u02dc50 nm. The experimental device also can handle particles up to \u02dc5 \u03bcm.",
                        "Charged particles are formed by electrospray ionization in the ESI 102 and transferred into a low vacuum through a 150-\u03bcm Pt electron microscope aperture. The desolvation tube 104 heats and dries the particles before they enter the ADL 106, which collimates and focuses the particle beam. The particle beam passes through two stages of differential pumping to reduce the ambient pressure prior to mass analysis and acceleration/deceleration in pumping section 108 and enters a chamber that houses the electrostatic quadrupole deflector 120. The QD 120 selectively turns particles, based on their kinetic energy per charge, 90\u00b0 and into the next chamber that contains the nanoparticle electrostatic trap 124. The NET 122 is a linear electrostatic trap configured as an image charge mass spectrometer. The NET can be constructed as first described by Zajfman and colleagues on ion ensembles (Zajfman D, Heber O, Vejby-Christensen L, Ben-Itzhak I, Rappaport M, Fishman R, et al. Electrostatic bottle for long-time storage of fast ion beams. Physical Review A. 1997; 55:R1577-R1580; Dahan M, Fishman R, Heber O, Rappaport M, Altstein N, Zajfman D, et al. A new type of electrostatic ion trap for storage of fast ion beams. Rev Sci Instrum. 1998; 69:76-83), and in a single-particle application by Benner (Benner W H. A gated electrostatic ion trap to repetitiously measure the charge and m/z of large electrospray ions. Anal Chem. 1997; 69:4162-8). The NET 122 is gated to trap one particle at a time, before measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and the absolute charge of the particle. These particles can be trapped in the NET 122 with an efficiency \u02dc70% for periods in excess of 5 seconds with a distribution of oscillation frequencies in the several hundred Hertz range. A Labview-based data acquisition code uses the m/z data to calculate the required switching times for the LINAC 124 to accelerate the particle up to the required velocity. The particle is then released from the trap into the LINAC for acceleration to the determined velocity.",
                        "An example LINAC 124 is a 40 element LINAC with 25 kV acceleration per element (using commercially available 30 kV fast switches) which permits acceleration across a potential difference of 1 megavolt. For aerosols >100 nm, many charges (100-1000) can be accommodated, allowing impact velocities, depending on charge and mass, as high as 8 km/sec as shown in Table 1 below. These velocities represent upper limits for each mass and charge:",

Reduction of the terminal velocity out of the accelerator 124 is accomplished by reducing the acceleration potential. In practice, the pulse duration and starting time vary as the square root of the mass. Acceleration will be triggered using the signal from the image charge detection assembly. For relatively narrow mass distributions it is unnecessary to adjust in real-time. A final charge pickup electrode structure at the exit of the LINAC 124 can be used to provide the timing signal for initiating pulsed laser irradiation of the particle (LDI) or VUV photoionization of secondary neutral products, as well as triggering the mass spectrometer and photomultiplier data acquisition system. The acceleration in the LINAC 124 can also be controlled to achieve a specific goal for impact with the target 126, for example, a predetermined range of velocity can be selected to cause the particle to split upon impact, vaporize upon impact, rebound upon impact, etc. The FIG. 1 can operate in real time to achieve any of those goals while accelerating a predetermined single nano or microparticle in a predetermined phase, e.g. heated or frozen.",

The overall gain of the amplifier 501 is determined by applying a 5 mV trapezoidal waveform, with rise and fall times similar to those of the waveforms induced by the oscillating particles, through a 1.5 pF capacitor attached directly to the ICD2 pickup. The capacitor converts the known voltage to a known charge, and the amplified response to the known input provides the overall gain calibration factor.

Additional targets have also been used for measuring coefficient of restitution with both tin and PSL particles. These targets include free standing thin film apertures with thicknesses below 50 nm. The apertures are mounted with a frame that suspends the taunt film in free space along the beam line of the spectrometer. In addition to coefficient of restitution measurements, the velocity at which these films broke was recorded.",
                        "Additional experiments have been performed using the spectrometer with solvent crystals and metallic tin particles wherein particles were accelerated to high velocities (>700 m/s) and impacted upon a multichannel plate detector. The particle fragmentation from impact was then imaged using a phosphor screen located behind the multichannel plate stack coupled with an external CCD camera to capture the fragmentation distribution.",
