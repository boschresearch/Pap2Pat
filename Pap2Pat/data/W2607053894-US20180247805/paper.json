    "abstract": "A new apparatus designed to accelerate/decelerate and study the surface impact phenomena of charged aerosols and nanoparticles over a wide range of mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios and final velocities is described. A nanoparticle ion source coupled with a linear electrostatic trap configured as an image charge detection (ICD) mass spectrometer allows determination of the mass-to-charge ratio and the absolute charge and mass of single nanoparticles. A nine-stage linear accelerator/decelerator is used to fix the final velocity of the nanoparticles, and in the results reported here the coefficient of restitution for polystyrene latex spheres (PSLs) impacting on silicon is measured using ICD techniques. To enable this apparatus to study a wide range of m/z, the data acquisition system uses a transient digitizer interfaced to a field-programmable gate array module that allows real time calculation of m/z and determination of the pulse sequence for the linear accelerator/decelerator. Electrospray ionization of a colloidal suspension of PSL spheres of 510 and 990 nm has been used to demonstrate acceleration and deceleration of charged nanoparticles and the resolution of the apparatus. Measurements of the coefficient of restitution for PSLs on silicon over the range 10-400 m/s are consistent with previous studies.",

                "As interest in the characterization of nanoparticles, aerosols and dusts increases, the need for the development of new tools for the manipulation and analysis of single particles continues to grow [1]. An area of continued interest for an understanding of problems ranging from atmospheric chemistry to astrophysical phenomena to industrial applications pertains to the impact phenomena of nanoparticles. Theoretical and experimental studies of nanoparticle-surface collisions at both low and high velocity ranges continue to be reported [2][3][4][5][6][7]. There is a large body of work on hypervelocity impact phenomena dating back to the early 1960's motivated by the need to understand the effect of cosmic dust and micrometeoroid impacts on space vehicles. Larger objects are most conveniently accelerated with light-gas guns [8], however, for smaller particles that can be easily charged, electrostatic accelerators are a convenient approach [9][10][11][12]. In early work in this area, a 2 MV van de Graaff dust accelerator was described and shown to accelerate 1 \u03bcm particles to ~6 km/s [10,11]. One early example of a switched, multistage linear accelerator for large particles was described by Vedder [13], however it was not until advances in high-voltage switching circuitry that laboratory-scale linear accelerators, such as the one described by Hendell and Even [14], became more common. In the present work the development of a versatile new nanoparticle mass spectrometer/accelerator/decelerator, the Aerosol Impact Spectrometer (AIS), is described with a demonstration of its capabilities using polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres, including studies of collision inelasticity on silicon wafers by determination of incident and scattered velocities in measurements of the coefficient of restitution.",
                "The key to carrying out mass spectrometric measurements on single charged nanoparticles is the use of charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) techniques (1). CDMS determines the absolute charge on a particle from the magnitude of the image charge induced on a pickup electrode when a charged particle passes through. The image charge waveform also yields the particle time-of-flight (TOF) and velocity through the pickup providing the mass-to-charge ratio for fixed energy particles [15]. This method has been used in accelerator experiments since at least 1960 [9], and with the increasing interest in studies of massive biomolecules, cells and nanoparticles it has seen more recent applications in mass spectrometry measurements [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24], with the state of the art recently described by Keifer and Jarrold [25]. In our own laboratory, we make use of a variant of this approach, applying a charge-pickup electrode in an electrostatic fast-ion beam trap to monitor the ion density oscillating in the trap and carry out Fourier-transform (FT) mass spectrometry on ensembles of molecular ions [26,27]. In the present apparatus the m/z ratio of a single particle provides the information required to accelerate or decelerate that particle for studies of particle impact.",
                "As shown by Hendell and Even [14], and later applied by Hsu and co-workers [28], a linear accelerator for large molecular ions can be configured using modern high-voltage MOSFET switching techniques. In the present apparatus, the CDMS determines the m/z ratio for each particle in real time, providing the information required to accelerate or decelerate single particles over a wide range of m/z by generating the appropriate acceleration/deceleration pulsed waveform for a linear accelerator (LINAC) structure composed of a series of cylindrical electrostatic elements. Acceleration of ion ensembles by this technique is not hindered by space charge limitations since the effect of space charge is progressively reduced as the particles accelerate. Deceleration of ion ensembles does become problematic as a result of increasing space charge, and that is the benefit of working with single charged nanoparticles where this limitation is not present.",
                "In the following sections, the initial results obtained with the AIS will be presented, showing the measurement of charge/mass distributions, acceleration and deceleration of single charged PSL spheres, and measurements of impact inelasticity of single particles with a silicon substrate. These results show that the AIS will have great utility for measuring the reflection of nanoparticles from surfaces, yielding quantitative information on the coefficient of restitution that describes the inelasticity of such collisions [29,30]."

An electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source and beam line including an aerodynamics lens (ADL) is orthogonal to the axis of the nanoparticle electrostatic trap (NET) and the LINAC. A quadrupole deflector (QD) is used to provide an energy selected beam of single nanoparticles for analysis in the NET. The QD can be operated over a wide energy range, selecting different particle distributions as determined by the size, charge and ESI expansion conditions. Characterization of the NET, the LINAC, and the initial measurements of impact dynamics are detailed in the following paragraphs.",
                "Charged particles are formed by electrospray ionization and transferred into a low vacuum through a 150-\u03bcm Pt electron microscope aperture. A heater tube dries the particles before they enter the ADL, which collimates and focuses the particle beam. The particle beam passes through two stages of differential pumping and enters a chamber that houses the electrostatic quadrupole deflector. The QD selectively turns particles 90 \u00b0based on their kinetic energy per charge into the next chamber that contains the NET. The NET is a linear electrostatic trap configured as an image charge mass spectrometer, as first described by Zajfman and co-workers on ion ensembles [31,32] and in a single-particle application by Benner [1]. Briefly, the NET is gated to trap one particle at a time, before measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and the absolute charge of the particle. These particles can be trapped in the NET with an efficiency ~70% for periods in excess of 5 seconds with a distribution of oscillation frequencies in the several hundred Hertz range. A Labview-based data acquisition code uses the m/z data to calculate the required switching times for the LINAC to accelerate the particle up to the required velocity. The particle is then released from the trap into the LINAC for acceleration to the desired velocity. "

The ESI source consists of a 360 \u03bcm O.D., 75 \u03bcm I.D. fused silica capillary mounted on an isolated aluminum block, which is held at approximately +4-6 kV. To date the AIS instrument has only been run in positive mode, but no impediment is anticipated for using it to study negatively charged particles. The tip of the capillary is positioned ~10 mm in front of a 150 \u03bcm aperture and is enclosed within a glass tube. The aperture is mounted on a 6.4 mm OD, 3.86 mm ID stainless steel tube that passes through an Ultra-Torr fitting into the instrument. The portion of this tube that extends out of the vacuum chamber is surrounded by an enclosure, through which nitrogen, heated to ~85 \u00b0C, flows. The heated nitrogen helps to desolvate the particles, and also acts as a curtain gas. 510 nm (Polyscience #07307) and 990 nm (Polyscience #07310) PSL spheres were suspended in 1:1 mixtures of 25 mM aqueous ammonium acetate and methanol, then delivered to the electrospray tip by a syringe pump operating at a rate of 0.26 mL/h. The final number densities were 30 \u00d7 10 9 particles per mL for the 510 nm PSL suspension, and 4.1 \u00d7 10 8 particles per mL for the 990 nm suspension. After entering the vacuum chamber, the particles pass through a 120 mm long, 4.5 mm I.D. stainless steel tube, which is heated to ~185 \u00b0C to completely desolvate the particles, and to evaporate charged solvent droplets."

The pressure at the start of the ADL is 2.6 Torr, and the pressure in the pumped region is typically in the range of 0.5-1 Torr. The precise pressure after the ADL is adjusted, by throttling the vacuum pump, in order to maximize transmission of particles in a specific size range. Calculations along the line of those described by Wang and McMurry [39] indicate that this ADL should transmit over 95% of particles in the range of 75 -1200 nm."

                        "After passing through this ICD tube, particles are transmitted into the NET. The design of the NET (Fig. 3) was modeled after the ion trap originally developed by Benner [1]. Two electrostatic mirrors each composed of four individual elements connected by a network of external potentiometers establish the fields that trap the charged particles. The mirror elements have an outer diameter of 63.5 mm, a beam-line inner diameter of 9.7 mm and a thickness of 1.5 mm. Each mirror stack incorporates an additional three elements that act as an intracavity einzel lens to refocus trapped particles. The NET has an ICD (ICD2) mounted in the field-free region centered between the two, sevenelement mirror stacks. ICD2 is a 38.1 mm long tube with an outer diameter of 15.9 mm and an inner diameter of 9.5 mm. The tube is isolated with PEEK insulators that mount on the final grounded einzel element of each mirror stack. The elements in each mirror stack are spaced by 4.8 mm nylon spacers mounted on alumina rods that hold the seven elements in place. The entire assembly is enclosed by two grounded plates and mounted on the isolated rail system with a total length of 173 mm. Each mirror stack is wired to a multipin feedthrough that connects to an external network of potentiometers. Each network is set up as a multistep voltage divider that controls the potential and field shape of each mirror stack independent of the other. The potentiometer networks are wired to two home-built high voltage (4 kV) MOSFET switches that control the mirror potentials. Potentials used on the NET mirrors are the same polarity as the charge of the particles being trapped. The intracavity-einzel lens can be operated in either polarity to establish a stable potential for trapping. SIMION 8.1.1 was used to generate a model of the field used in this experiment for the NET as shown in Fig. 4 [40]. ICD2 is wired directly to the junction field-effect transistor (JFET) input of an Amptek A250 charge sensitive amplifier circuit. This circuit is mounted in a shielded box directly above the assembly, and the output is connected with shielded coaxial cable to a coaxial feedthrough.",
                        "The signal from the NET ICD2 is connected to a home-built shaping amplifier for baseline subtraction and signal gain. The output of this amplifier is connected to an FPGA (National Instruments PXI-7952R) with a high-speed digitizer front end Fig. 3 Diagram of the NET. V M is the potential applied to the NET mirrors. V EE is the potential applied to the embedded einzel. Separate potentiometer networks with separate HV switches control the two mirror potentials independent of each other, allowing for complete control of trapping potentials (National Instruments NI 5731) and an oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 3034) (Fig. 5). The overall gain of the A250 preamplifier and shaping amplifier is determined by applying a 5 mV trapezoidal waveform, with rise and fall times similar to those of the waveforms induced by the oscillating particles, through a 1.5 pF capacitor attached directly to the ICD pickup. The capacitor converts the known voltage to a known charge, and the amplified response to the known input provides the overall gain calibration factor. As currently configured this amplifier has successfully detected particles with as low as ~1000 charges. Based on variation in the response to the calibration input signal, the 1 standard deviation uncertainty on the charge measurement is roughly 100 charges. The initial state of the trap has the entrance mirror potential lowered, and the exit mirror potential raised. When a particle passes through ICD2 in the trap, the output pulse from the charge-sensitive amplifier triggers closing of the entrance mirror. With both mirrors raised the charged particle oscillates in the trap producing a regular signal from ICD2 with a measurable amplitude and frequency. This signal is captured by the FPGA digitizer and analyzed by a LabView code while the particle is still trapped. The m/z ratio of the particle in the trap is determined from its oscillation frequency, f, using the following relationship [1,26]:",

The region of interest is the curved band (the large horizontal feature correlated with lower peak heights corresponds to particles that have impacted the surface of ICD-QD2, rather than passing through). The inverse relationship between the amplitude of the image charge signal and QD potential is consistent with particles presenting with a constant total kinetic energy, which in turn is consistent with particles of similar size, travelling at similar velocities. At low QD potentials, particles with a large number of charges are selected, with the number of charges limited by the Rayleigh limit. At high QD potentials, the kinetic energy is partitioned among fewer charges, leading to the detection of correspondingly smaller amplitude image charge signals.",

The average number of charges on a 990 nm PSL as measured by ICD2 for particles selected with the QD set to 400 V is 17000. This corresponds to a peak height of 0.45 V on ICD-QD2, so the Rayleigh limit of 26500 charges would correspond to about 0.7 V (as shown by the dashed red line). The large number of peaks with heights of <0.2 V are due to particles that have hit the detector pickup instead of passing all the way through In Fig. 8 the measured charge distributions for 510 nm and 990 nm particles are shown. In these measurements, the QD was set to 70 V for selection of 510 nm particles, and to 400 V for 990 nm particles.

In the experiments presented here (using positively charged particles) acceleration was accomplished using negative potentials on the LINAC ranging from 0 V to Fig. 8 Charge distribution of 510 nm PSL (blue) and 990 nm PSL (red) species, energy selected for 70 eV/z and 400 eV/z, respectively -45.0 kV (nine stages at -5 kV/stage). Results using an acceleration potential -22.5 kV are shown in Fig. 11. Deceleration of particles was accomplished using positive potentials on the LINAC ranging from 0 V to +383 V (nine stages at 42.5 V/stage). Results using the deceleration potential +315 V are shown in Fig. 12. The apparatus is designed to use voltages up to 20 kV/stage. A terminal velocity of 2.5 km/s would be expected to be reached at 180 kV for the 510 nm PSLs with m/z values used in the present experiments. As Hsu and co-workers have shown, [28] it should be straightforward to extend the number of LINAC stages, and the apparatus is already configured to do so."

                "Formation, trapping, acceleration/deceleration, and coefficient of restitution measurements of highly-charged submicron particles have been demonstrated. Single highly charged PSL spheres have been generated with an ESI source. Subsequent trapping and CDMS analysis of individual particles has been demonstrated. Individual particle acceleration/deceleration has been demonstrated, allowing the acquisition of quantitative coefficient of restitution data. The flexibility of single particle on-the-fly analysis allows the Aerosol Impact Spectrometer to function with a wide range of nanoparticle masses and charges from a given particle source. Additionally, the variable energy selection of the spectrometer allows a variety of particle sources to be implemented in addition to the demonstrated electrospray ionization, including liquid metal ion sources [54][55][56] and needle-charge dust sources [57,58]. The wide range of final energies achievable with the variable linear accelerator/decelerator will allow for a variety of scattering experiments to be performed to examine both hypo-and hypervelocity impact phenomena"
