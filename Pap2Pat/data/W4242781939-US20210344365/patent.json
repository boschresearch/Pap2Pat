                                "As fundamental building blocks in radio frequency (RF) and microwave systems, filters are used to better define the system bandwidth or reject undesired signals. In a conventional filter, rejection is achieved by presenting significantly mismatched impedance to the undesired (out-of-band) signals. In some systems, such reflection will deteriorate the performance of adjacent non-linear devices, such as analog-to-digital converters, mixers, and high-gain amplifiers. A common solution to this problem is to insert non-reciprocal devices, such as isolators or circulators, to re-direct the reflected signal to an absorptive load. However, this approach comes at a cost because the magnetic non-reciprocal devices are known to be bulky, expensive, bandwidth limited, and are difficult to integrate with the rest of the active electronics.",
                                "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in reflectionless (absorptive) filters which effectively mitigate the reflection signals. In contrast to the conventional reflective-type filters, the non-transmitted stopband signals in a reflectionless filter are dissipated within the filter itself. In other words, reflectionless filters provide good impedance matching not only in the passband but also in the stopband.",
                                "A number of reflectionless bandpass filter designs have been proposed. However, these proposed designs have a number of drawbacks, including: providing limited bandwidth; having a large circuit size; causing high insertion loss; and exhibiting absorptive behavior in only a limited frequency range. As a consequence, reflectionless bandpass filters, particularly those that are well-matched at both the input and output ports, still remain a challenge to design.",
                                "Hence, what is needed is a reflectionless bandpass filter design that does not suffer from the drawbacks of existing reflectionless bandpass filter designs."

                                "Several reflectionless bandstop filter designs have been developed based on: lossy resonators, a bridge-T structure, and a complementary diplexer architecture. Essentially, directional filter topologies are used to implement reflectionless bandpass filters. The penalty paid, however, includes limited bandwidth, large circuit size, and high insertion loss. An asymmetrical quasi-reflectionless bandpass filter with tunable passband has also been developed by using lossy resonators close to one of its termination ports. Hence, reflectionless bandpass filters, particularly those that are well-matched at both the input and output ports, still remain a challenge to design.",
                                "Based on the even-odd-duality theory, lumped-element reflectionless prototypes having low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, or bandstop characteristics have been developed with theoretically all-band fully reflectionless characteristics at both the input and output ports. Based on the reflectionless low-pass prototypes, distributed first-order and higher-order reflectionless filters have been derived. In these designs, however, only the order of the absorptive section circuit is increased whereas a single bandpass resonator is used in the main channel. Despite sharper passband roll-off at the transmission zero frequencies, the far-out roll-off of the filter remains the same, as is illustrated in FIG. 1A. Lumped implementations of symmetrical lumped reflectionless filters with arbitrary prescribed transmission responses have also been developed.",
                                "To achieve symmetrical two-port reflectionless properties using the complementary diplexer architecture, auxiliary absorptive circuits need to be loaded at both the input and output ports. The associated theoretical analysis demonstrates symmetrical quasi-reflectionless properties and provides general guidance in terms of implementations using acoustic, lumped-element, transmission-line, etc. However, the resulting overall circuit size is considerably larger than that of its associated bandpass filter circuit. Also, the demonstrated microstrip filters show absorptive behavior only in a limited frequency range, and they degenerate back to reflective-type responses at the stopband center frequency, as is illustrated in FIG. 1B.",
                                "A conventional reflection-type coupled line is shown in FIG. 2A, and an absorptive coupled line loading with a one-pole absorptive stub is shown in FIG. 2B. To enhance the all-band matching and the in-band transmission flatness, the one-pole stub of FIG. 2B is modified to form the proposed two-pole absorptive stub shown in FIG. 2C.",
                                "In this specification, high-order quasi-reflectionless filters with improved passband flatness and out-of-band rejection (as shown in FIG. 1C), are presented using the proposed absorptive stub section illustrated in FIG. 2C. Analysis shows that this structure absorbs not only the stopband reflection, but also the close-to-passband signals, thus improving the passband roll-off and close-in rejection. The higher-order nature of the absorptive circuit significantly improves the passband transmission flatness, particularly at the edge of the passband. In addition, a higher-order reflectionless passband can be easily realized by increasing the order of the bandpass sections without changing the matching performance. To further improve the out-of-band rejection, cross-coupling can be introduced between the absorptive stubs. The proposed designs advance the state-of-the-art by demonstrating high-order distributed quasi-reflectionless filters with a flat passband, enhanced out-of-band rejection, and good impedance matching both in-band and out-of-band."

FIGS. 13A and 13B show examples of a 2-pole and a 3-pole quasi-reflectionless filter, respectively. Zc2 and kc2 are the coupled-lines impedance and the coupling coefficient, respectively.

The transfer functions of both filters are almost unchanged as kc2 varies, which again verifies that the bandwidth of this kind of absorptive filters is mainly determined by their absorptive stubs. Changing kc2 also has almost no effect on the stopband reflection since the latter is directly related to the absorption. However, the reflection in the vicinity of the passband depends strongly on kc2. A good compromise between passband reflection (|S11|<\u221225 dB) and stopband reflection (|S11|<\u221214 dB) is achieved at kc2=1.8 for both the 2-pole and the 3-pole quasi-reflectionless filters.",

We can see that the passband bandwidth is almost identical for the three filters. Increasing the filter order only improves the far-out-of-band rejection. Consequently, the passband bandwidth and stop-band attenuation specifications can be individually fulfilled in the design process.",

                                "The performance of the proposed quasi-reflectionless filters may be further improved by introducing cross-coupling between the absorptive stubs. Cross-coupling introduces additional signal paths between the input and output ports of a filter to create transmission zeros at certain frequencies. The transmission zeros result in sharper rejection without having to use additional resonators. As such, cross-coupling techniques are widely used in the design of conventional filters.",

Cross-coupling can also be implemented in the form of two-path signal-cancellation. In this case, cross-coupling can be introduced between the absorptive stubs to realize additional transmission zeros. To illustrate this, three examples are shown below.",
                                "Cross-coupling is introduced into the proposed absorptive bandpass filters, which are already systematically studied in the \u201cAbsorptive Coupled-Lines\u201d section above. FIG. 16A shows a cross-coupled 1-pole quasi-reflectionless filter similar to that of FIG. 6. Cross-coupling is introduced by connecting together the last quarter-wavelength resonator in each absorptive stub. This essentially merges the two quarter-wavelength stubs into one. As seen in FIG. 16B, two transmission zeros are generated at 0.6 GHz and 1.4 GHz, with a slight penalty in close-in rejection. Interestingly, the cross-coupling also helps to improve passband return loss.",
                                "Although the filter of FIG. 16A looks similar to the filter illustrated in FIG. 1A, they are in fact fundamentally different because they are designed based on the reflectionless feed line and even-odd duality, respectively. This difference is much more obvious for their high-order forms.",
                                "FIG. 17A shows a 2-pole cross-coupled quasi-reflectionless filter. In this case, cross-coupling is achieved through a short-ended coupled-lines section with coupled impedance Zcr2 and coupling coefficient kcr2. FIG. 17B shows a parametric study of the frequency response of this filter with respect to kcr2 when Zcr2 is 70\u03a9. As kcr2 increases from 1.6 to 2.8, the two transmission zeros at 0.8 GHz and 1.2 GHz move closer to the imaginary axis but the return loss at the transition band (e.g., 0.83 GHz and 1.17 GHz) deteriorates with an increased transmission insertion loss.",
                                "Following a similar method as the above, cross-coupling can be introduced in a 3-pole quasi-reflectionless filter as shown in FIG. 18A. Two short-circuit quarter-wavelength coupled-lines connect the last quarter-wavelength resonators in each absorptive stub. Two transmission zeros at 0.6 GHz and 1.4 GHz can be generated with almost unaltered filter reflection responses when the coupled coefficient kcr2 is properly chosen. Unlike the 2-pole filter of FIG. 17B where the insertion loss is degraded by the cross-coupling, the 3-pole quasi-reflectionless bandpass filter with cross-coupling develops an equi-ripple passband with the help of additional transmission zeros created by the cross-coupling."

The ripple bandwidth BWr and hence the cut-off frequency f1 of the prototype filter can be calculated from BW3 dB. Initial parameters of the absorptive stub circuit (Za, Zb, Zc) are then determined by (1), (9), (10), and (11). For simplicity, the resistor R can be set to be the same with the termination reference impedance Z0.",

Zc1 and kc1 of the absorptive coupled-lines are used to cover the required transmission bandwidth. The values of the impedance scaling parameters ra, rb, and rc can be found by parametric analysis to realize a good compromise between a flat passband and good overall return loss.",
                                "(4) To meet the stopband attenuation specification, the order of the filter can be increased by simply cascading coupled-line sections (Zc2 and kc2) to the above 1-pole absorptive filter without significantly changing the passband transmission and reflection.",
                                "(5) Stopband attenuation can be further improved by introducing cross-coupling as in FIGS. 16A, 17A and 18A. For a given attenuation requirement, the choice between increasing the order and using cross-coupling should be carefully weighed."
