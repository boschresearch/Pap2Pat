# DESCRIPTION

- claim Paris Convention priority

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- motivate heteronuclear decoupling in fast magic-angle spinning NMR
- discuss limitations of existing decoupling methods

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce inventive method for heteronuclear decoupling

## DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

- describe experimental setup and methods
- introduce Phase-Inverted Supercycled Sequence for Attenuation of Rotary ResOnance (PISSARRO)
- compare performance of PISSARRO with other decoupling methods

### Quenching of Modulation Sidebands

- discuss modulation sidebands in XiX decoupling
- show suppression of modulation sidebands with PISSARRO
