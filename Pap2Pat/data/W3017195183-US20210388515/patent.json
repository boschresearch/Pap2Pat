                        "Hydrogen (H2) gas is a clean and effective energy carrier to store renewable and sustainable energies, which can be efficiently converted to electricity through fuel cell technology. H2 gas production is important to achieving a carbon-neutral energy route. High-temperature electrolysis is a conventional process for H2 gas production that has several advantages, such as high efficiency, fast electrode kinetics, and relatively less expensive materials. Many electrochemical cells employed for high-temperature electrolysis can also be reversibly operated such that energy storage and electricity generation can be effectuated simultaneously.",
                        "High-temperature solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) are one type of electrochemical cell that has conventionally been employed to produce H2 gas through H2O electrolysis. However, high-temperature solid-oxide electrolysis cells can suffer from material degradation and material incompatibilities at the relatively higher operating temperatures (e.g., above 600\u00b0 C., above 700\u00b0 C.) typically required thereby.",
                        "To achieve H2 gas production at relatively lower temperatures, protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) have been investigated, since the electrolyte material thereof generally exhibits lower ionic diffusion activation energy over conventional oxygen-ion conductors (e.g., YSZ, GDC, etc.). For example, the operating temperature for many PCECs can be as low as 400\u00b0 C. In addition, PCECs can produce dry H2 gas, circumventing many problems otherwise associated with purifying humid H2 gas and/or undesirable steam-based metal oxidation. However, challenges remain in the use of PCECs to produce H2 gas since the steam-side electrodes thereof generally need to be exposed to highly humid air conditions. If the operating temperature of the PCEC is further decreased, the steam-side electrodes may exhibit significant over-potential as catalytic activity becomes poor.",
                        "It would be desirable to have new structures, apparatuses, methods, and systems for producing H2 gas and generating electricity. It would further be desirable if the new structures, apparatuses, methods, and systems facilitated increased H2 gas production and electricity generation efficiency, increased operational life, and were relatively inexpensive and simple in operation."

As a non-limiting example, during electrolysis mode operation of the electrochemical cell 100 of the electrochemical apparatus 304, one or more of the H2 gas stream 322 and the O2 gas stream 318 exiting the electrochemical apparatus 304 may be directed into a heat exchanger configured and operated to facilitate heat exchange between the H2 gas stream 322 and/or the O2 gas stream 318 of the system 300 and one or more other relatively cooler streams (e.g., in some embodiments, the steam stream 314) of the system 300 to transfer heat from the H2 gas stream 322 and/or the O2 gas stream 318 to the relatively cooler stream(s) to facilitate the recovery of the thermal energy input into and generated within the electrochemical apparatus 304. The recovered thermal energy may increase process efficiency and/or reduce operational costs without having to react (e.g., combust) the H2 gas stream 322 and/or the O2 gas stream 318. As another non-limiting example, during fuel cell mode operation of the electrochemical cell 100 of the electrochemical apparatus 304, the H2O stream 316 exiting the electrochemical apparatus 304 may be directed into a heat exchanger configured and operated to facilitate heat exchange between the H2O stream 316 of the system 300 and one or more other relatively cooler streams (e.g., in some embodiments, one or more of the O2 gas-containing stream 320 and the H2 gas-containing stream 324) of the system 300 to transfer heat from H2O stream 316 to the relatively cooler stream(s) to facilitate the recovery of the thermal energy input into and generated within the electrochemical apparatus 304. The recovered thermal energy may increase process efficiency and/or reduce operational costs without having to react (e.g., combust) one or more of the streams employed in the system 300.",
