                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Parkinson's disease (hereinafter also referred to as PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It is connected to the death of dopaminergic cells of a region of the mid-brain, the substantia nigra. Initial symptoms include shaking, rigidity, impairment, particularly slowness of movement. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep and behavioural disorders. In some cases, cognitive disorders can appear at a later stage, including dementia.",
                        "An increasing prevalence for PD can be detected in advanced age, with 1% among 60-year-olds and 3% in the 80-year-old age-group (Di Napoli, M., I. M. Shah, and D. A. Stewart, Molecular pathways and genetic aspects of Parkinson's disease: from bench to bedside. Expert Rev Neurother, 2007. 7(12): p. 1693-729). Of note is that patients with PD have a roughly 6-times higher risk to develop a dementia than an age-matched healthy control group (Rongve, A. A., D., Management of Parkinson's disease dementia: practical considerations. Drugs Aging, 2006. 23(10): p. 807-822). Up to 50% of the patients show cognitive decline in terms of a mild cognitive impairment already in early stages (Caballol, N., M. J. Marti, and E. Tolosa, Cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson disease. Mov Disord, 2007. 22 Suppl 17: p. S358-66) whereby 30% of these patients develop a dementive syndrome in the course of the disease which often also includes changes in personality (Dubois, B. and B. Pillon, Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease. J Neurol, 1997. 244(1): p. 2-8). The dementive syndrome usually develops after approximately 8 to 10 years and has a huge influence on the course of the disease and also on the social environment with higher requirements for families and caretakers during everyday care which put a psychological strain on the patient and the environment (Aarsland, D., et al., Mental symptoms in Parkinson's disease are important contributors to caregiver distress. Int J Geriatr Psychiatry, 1999. 14(10): p. 866-74), leading to increased stress during home care (Caballol, N., M. J. Marti, and E. Tolosa, Cognitive dysfunction and dementia in Parkinson disease. Mov Disord, 2007. 22 Suppl 17: p. S358-66) with growing need for professional care. The dementive syndrome also goes along with a worsening prognosis with respect to disease-progression and expectancy of life for the patients (Louis, E. D., et al., Mortality from Parkinson disease. Arch Neurol, 1997. 54(3): p. 260-4). However, early treatment is critical since according to present knowledge early therapy of cognitive deficits is crucial to its success (Singh, B. and J. T. O'Brien, When should drug treatment be started for people with dementia? Maturitas, 2009. 62(3): p. 230-4). Therefore, there is a clear need for an early marker to define patients at risk.",
                        "Neuropathologically, PD dementia (hereinafter also referred to as PDD) is characterized by the occurrence of cortical Lewy bodies that do also occur in patients with Lewy-body-dementia, another clinical entity of dementia with a more rapid progression (Goedert, M. and MG. Spillantini, Lewy body diseases and multiple system atrophy as alpha-synucleinopathies. Mol Psychiatry, 1998. 3(6): p. 462-5; Jellinger, K. A., A critical evaluation of current staging of alpha-synuclein pathology in Lewy body disorders. Biochim Biophys Acta, 2009. 1792(7): p. 730-40; Jellinger, K. A. and J. Atterns, Prevalence and impact of vascular and Alzheimer pathologies in Lewy body disease. Acta Neuropathol, 2008. 115(4): p. 427-36; Mukaetova-Ladinska, E. B. and I. G. McKeith, Pathophysiology of synuclein aggregation in Lewy body disease. Mech Ageing Dev, 2006. 127(2): p. 188-202). It has been shown that these Lewy bodies contain a-synuclein, a presynaptic filament protein that is expressed at high concentrations in the terminal endings of neurons. Therefore, an obvious working theory is that these Lewy bodies are directly linked to the neuropathological processes, especially that a-synuclein inclusions are mostly present in surviving cells and less so in apoptotic cells, suggesting that these inclusions may play a protective role in cell death by sequestering toxic molecular species (Tanaka, M., et al., Aggresomes formed by alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1 are cytoprotective. J Biol Chem, 2004. 279(6): p. 4625-31; Kramer, M. L. and W. J. Schulz-Schaeffer, Presynaptic alpha-synuclein aggregates, not Lewy bodies, cause neurodegeneration in dementia with Lewy bodies. J Neurosci, 2007. 27(6): p. 1405-10). Regarding the formation of a-synuclein containing inclusion bodies and their importance in neuropathological alterations, Braak et al. were able to indicate a topographical extent of these lesions with an initial onset in the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal as well as vagal nerves and anterior olfactory nucleus in the brain stem, proceeding with an ascending course to cortical structures, beginning with the anteromedial temporal mesocortex (Braak, H. and E. Braak, Pathoanatomy of Parkinson's disease. J Neurol, 2000. 247 Suppl 2: p. II3-10; Braak, H., et al., Parkinson's disease: affection of brain stein nuclei controlling premotor and motor neurons of the somatomotor system. Acta Neuropathol, 2000. 99(5): p. 489-95; Wolters, E. and H. Braak, Parkinson's disease: premotor clinico-pathological correlations. J Neural Transco Suppl, 2006(70): p. 309-19). As a possible link between neurotoxicity, aggregation and propagation it might be concluded that species of neurotoxic oligomers can be transformed to oligomers which are not neurotoxic, but have a higher tendency of further aggregation (Danzer, K. M., et al., Different species of alpha-synuclein oligomers induce calcium influx and seeding. J Neurosci, 2007. 27(34): p. 9220-32; Schnack, C., et al., Protein array analysis of oligomerization-induced changes in alpha-synuclein protein-protein interactions points to an interference with Cdc42 effector proteins. Neuroscience, 2008. 154(4): p. 1450-7).",
                        "The present inventors and others made attempts to improve the early diagnosis of PDD in PD patients by measurement of a-synuclein or proposed a-synuclein aggregates and by known biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and serum (Jesse, S. S., P.; Lehnert, S.; Gillardon, F.; Hcngerer, B.; Otto, M., Neurochemical approaches in the laboratory diagnosis of Parkinson and Parkinson dementia syndromes: a review. CNS Neurosci Ther, 2009. 15, (2): p. 157-82; Parnetti, L., et al., Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in Parkinson's disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. Biol Psychiatry, 2008. 64(10): p. 850-5). However, for prognosis of disease progression in an individual patient this neurochemical profile is currently of limited use (Jesse, S. S., P.; Lehnert, S.; Gillardon, F.; Hengerer, B.; Otto, M., Neurochemical approaches in the laboratory diagnosis of Parkinson and Parkinson dementia syndromes: a review. CNS Neurosci Ther, 2009. 15, (2): p. 157-82).",
                        "Diagnosis and/or prognosis of PDD and differential diagnosis and/or prognosis between PDD and PD is still performed by physicians on the basis of the patient's medical history and neurological examination.",
                        "Thus, there is a need in the art for laboratory-based tests for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of PDD and for differential diagnosis and/or prognosis between PDD and PD.",
                        "Using an optimized protocol for the proteomic analysis of a cerebrospinal fluid sample (CSF), which particularly accounts for the brain protein variation caused by CSF flow (Brechlin, P., et al., Cerebrospinal fluid-optimized two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) facilitates the differential diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Proteomics, 2008. 8(20): p. 4357-66), the present inventors investigated a set of well defined clinical groups of patients with PD, PDD and a control group to find a biomarker which can differentiate between demented and non-demented persons.",
                        "Thereby, they found that PDD patients can be identified and PDD patients can be distinguished from PD patients by detecting O-glycosylation in a protein comprising a Ser/Thr motive, particularly Serpin A1, and/or by detecting the level of sialic acid on a protein comprising a Ser/Thr motive, particularly Serpin A1, in a biological sample such as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample."

The terms \u201cdifferential diagnosing\u201d and \u201cdifferential prognosing\u201d between PD and PDD relate to the discrimination between both disease states based on observations made with respect to the O-glycosylation in a protein comprising a Scr/Thr motive, particularly Serpin A1, and/or the level of sialic acid on said protein, particularly Serpin A1.",

Thus, said protein may be a substrate for a protein-O-fucosyltransferase. O-linked glycans/glycomoieties (also designated as O-linked polysaccharides or oligosaccharides) are usually attached to the polypeptide chain by a protein-O-fucosyltransferase through serine or threonine residues, O-linked glycosylation is a true post-translational event which occurs in the Golgi apparatus and which does not require a consensus sequence and no oligosaccharide precursor is required for protein transfer. The most common type of O-linked glycans contain an initial GalNAc residue (or Tn epitope), these are commonly referred to as mucin-type glycans. Other O-linked glycans include glucosamine, xylose, galactose, fucose, or manose as the initial sugar bound to the Ser/Thr residues. O-linked glycoproteins are usually large proteins (>200 kDa) that are commonly bianttennary with comparatively less branching than N-glycans (see, for example, Robert G. Spiro, \u201cProtein glycosylation: nature, distribution, enzymatic formation, and disease implications of glycopeptides bonds\u201d, Glycobiology, Vol. 12, No. 4, pp. 43R-56R, 2002).",

                        "The term \u201cprotein isoform\u201d, as used herein, refers to any of several different forms of the same protein. Usually, different forms of a protein may be produced from related genes, or may arise from the same gene by alternative splicing. A large number of isoforms are caused by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small genetic differences between alleles of the same gene. These occur at specific individual nucleotide positions within a gene. A protein isoform may further be characterized by its posttranslational modifications. The term \u201cposttranslational modifications\u201d, as used herein, refers to modifications of amino acids which may extend the range of functions of the protein by attaching it to other biochemical functional groups such as acetate, phosphate, various lipids and carbohydrates, by changing the chemical nature of an amino acid (e.g. citrullination) or by making structural changes, like the formation of disulfide bridges. Posttranslational modifications usually occur after translation. Well known posttranslational modifications are glycosylations or phosphorylations.",
                        "An isoform of a protein that differs only with respect to the number and/or type of attached glycan is herein referred to as \u201cglycosylated isoform\u201d. Glycoproteins often consist of a number of different glycoforms, with alterations in the attached saccharide or oligosaccharide. These modifications may result from differences in biosynthesis during the process of glycosylation, or due to the action of glycosidases or glycosyltransferases. Glycoforms may be detected through detailed chemical analysis of separated glycoforms, but more conveniently detected through differential reaction with lectins, as in lectin affinity chromatography and lectin affinity electrophoresis.",
                        "The term \u201cSerpin\u201d, as used herein, comprises Serpin family members characterized by common structural features. Serpins are usually comprised of three beta-sheets and eight or nine alpha-helices. Serpins also possess an exposed region termed the reactive centre loop (RCL) that, in inhibitory molecules, includes the specificity determining region and forms the initial interaction with the target protease (see, for example, Loebermann H, Tokuoka R, Deisenhofer J, Huber R.

It is also known as serum trypsin inhibitor. For most, the primary function of the Serpins is the regulation of proteolytic events associated with a plurality of biochemical pathways such as protein folding, cell migration, cell differentiation, modulation of inflammatory response, etc., but many have alternate functions such as hormone transport (cortisol-binding globulin and thyroxine binding globulin) or blood pressure regulation (angiotensinogen). Serpin A1 is secreted and its targets are, for example, elastase, plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and plasminogen activator. Inhibitory Serpin A1 interacts with its target proteinase at a reactive site located within a loop structure in its C-terminal region. The reactive center loop (RCL) extends out from the body of the protein and directs binding to the target protease. The protease cleaves the Serpin A1 at the reactive site within the RCL, establishing a covalent linkage between the carboxyl group of the Serpin reactive site and the serine hydroxyl of the protease. The resulting inactive Serpin-protease complex is highly stable. The human gene encoding Serpin A1 is located at chromosome 14, region 14q32.1.",

The linkages between the Sia units in an oligoSia chain or polySia chain can vary. The most common linkage is, however, a \u03b12-8 linkage. Terminal sialic, oligosialic, and polysialic acids can, for example, be degraded by a sialidase (neuraminidase). Said enzyme is able to cleave \u03b12-8 linkages between sialic acid residues or \u03b12-3 linkages between a sialic acid residue and a hexose molecule such as a mannose, glucose or galactose molecule.

                        "The term \u201c1D (One-dimensional) gel electrophoresis\u201d, as used herein, includes protein separation techniques such as Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), native gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The SDS-PAGE, for example, is a technique for separating proteins based on their ability to move within an electrical current, which is a function of the length of their polypeptide chains or of their molecular weight. The addition of the SDS detergent to these samples gives the proteins the same electrical charge. SDS-PAGE allows for separation of proteins from a wide range of samples including cells, tissues and whole blood. Native Gel Electrophoresis, for example, is a technique used mainly in protein electrophoresis where the proteins are not denatured and therefore separated based on their charge-to-mass ratio. The main types of native gels used in protein electrophoresis are polyacrylamide gels and agarose gels. It should be noted that unlike SDS-PAGE type electrophoreses, native gel electrophoresis does not use a charged denaturing agent. The proteins being separated, therefore, differ in molecular mass and intrinsic charge and experience different electrophoretic forces dependent on the ratio of the two. Since the proteins remain in the native state they may be visualized not only by general protein staining reagents but also by specific enzyme-linked staining. Further, isoelectric focusing (IEF) (also known as electrofocusing), for example, is a technique to separate the proteins by isoelectric point. Thereby, a gradient of pH is applied to a gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel, making one end more positive than the other. At all pHs other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If the proteins are positively charged, they will be pulled towards the more negative end of the gel and if the proteins are negatively charged they will be pulled to the more positive end of the gel. The proteins applied in the IEF will move along the gel and will accumulate at their isoelectric point; that is, the point at which the overall charge on the protein is 0 (a neutral charge). IEF is preferably carried out using immobilized pH gradient (iPG) gels, or iPG strips, more preferably dry and rehydratable iPG strips. Microfluidic chip based isoelectric focusing may also be used (Sommer and Hatch, Electrophoresis. 2009 March; 30(5):742-5.). Preferably, the 1D gel electrophoresis is isoelectric focusing (IEF) or SDS-PAGE as first dimension to separate the proteins according to their isoelectric point (pI).",
                        "The term \u201c2D (Two-dimensional) gel electrophoresis\u201d, refers to a form of gel electrophoresis commonly used to analyze proteins in two dimensions. 2D gel electrophoresis, for example, begins with 1D electrophoresis but then separates the molecules by a second property in a direction 90 degrees from the first. In 1D electrophoresis, proteins are separated in one dimension, so that all the proteins/molecules will lie along a lane but that the molecules are spread out across a 2D gel. The two dimensions that proteins are separated into using this technique can be isoelectric point, protein complex mass in the native state, and protein mass. Preferably, the first dimension is isoelectric focusing (IEF) and the second dimension is SDS-PAGE. As to the separation of proteins by their isoelectric point (isoelectric focusing, IEF) and as to the separation of proteins by their mass (SDS-PAGE) it is referred to the explanations made above. Preferably, the 2D gel electrophoresis is isoelectric focusing (IEF) as first dimension and SDS-PAGE as second dimension to separate the proteins according to their isoelectric point (pI) and according to their protein mass.",
                        "The proteins separated with gel electrophoresis can then be detected by a variety of means known to the person skilled in the art. Preferably, silver and Coomassie Blue staining are used. In the case of silver staining, a silver colloid is applied to the gel. The silver binds to cysteine groups within the protein. The silver is darkened by exposure to ultra-violet light. The darkness of the silver can be related to the amount of silver and therefore the amount of protein at a given location on the gel. This measurement can only give approximate amounts, but is adequate for most purposes.",
                        "Western blotting, for example, is a technique which allows the detection of specific proteins (native or denatured) from extracts made from cells or tissues or body liquid samples, before or after any purification steps. Proteins are generally separated by size using gel electrophoresis before being transferred to a synthetic membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF) via dry, semi-dry, or wet blotting methods. The membrane can then be probed using antibodies using methods similar to immunohistochemistry, but without a need for fixation. Detection is typically performed using reporter enzyme linked antibodies, e.g. peroxidase linked antibodies to catalyze a chemiluminescent reaction or alkaline phosphatase linked antibodies to catalyze a colorimetric reaction. Western blotting is a routine molecular biology method that can be used to semiquantitatively or quantitatively compare protein levels between extracts. The size separation prior to blotting allows the protein molecular weight to be gauged as compared with known molecular weight markers. Western blotting is an analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in a given sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate proteins by the length of the polypeptide (denaturing conditions) or by the 3-D structure of the protein (native/non-denaturing conditions). The colorimetric detection method may depend on incubation of the Western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different color that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot may be then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels may be evaluated through densitometry (how intense the stain is) or spectrophotometry. Further, chemiluminescent detection methods may depend on incubation of the Western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody. The light is then detected by photographic film, and more recently by CCD cameras which capture a digital image of the Western blot. The image may be analysed by densitometry, which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density. Newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used.",
                        "The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ELISA, for example, is a method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimized by optimizing blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence of positive and negative controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.",
                        "The term \u201cmass spectrometry (MS)\u201d, as used herein, refers to the use of an ionization source to generate gas phase ions from a sample on a surface and detecting the gas phase ions with a mass spectrometer. The term \u201claser desorption mass spectrometry\u201d refers to the use of a laser as an ionization source to generate gas phase ions from a sample on a surface and detecting the gas phase ions with a mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometry may be a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry or MALDI. In MALDI, the analyte is typically mixed with a matrix material that, upon drying, co-crystallizes with the analyte. The matrix material absorbs energy from the energy source which otherwise would fragment the labile biomolecules or analytes. The mass spectrometry may also be a surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry or SELDI. In SELDI, the surface on which the analyte is applied plays an active role in the analyte capture and/or desorption. The biological sample used in the method of the first aspect of present invention may have undergone chromatographic or other chemical processing. In mass spectrometry the \u201capparent molecular mass\u201d refers to the molecular mass (in Daltons)-to-charge value, m/z, of the detected ions. How the apparent molecular mass is derived is dependent upon the type of mass spectrometer used. With a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, the apparent molecular mass is a function of the time from ionization to detection. The term \u201csignal\u201d refers to any response generated by a biomolecule such as protein under investigation. For example, the term signal refers to the response generated by a biomolecule hitting the detector of a mass spectrometer. The signal intensity correlates with the amount or concentration of the biomolecule. The signal is defined by two values: an apparent molecular mass value and an intensity value generated as described. The mass value is an elemental characteristic of the biomolecule, whereas the intensity value accords to a certain amount or concentration of the biomolecule with the corresponding apparent molecular mass value. Thus, the \u201csignal\u201d always refers to the properties of the biomolecule.",

For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one peptide from many entering a mass spectrometer. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A third mass analyzer then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also be done in a single mass analyzer over time, as in a quadrupole ion trap. There are various methods for fragmenting molecules for tandem MS, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD), electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) and surface-induced dissociation (SID).",

Sialidase enzymes are a large family, found in a range of organisms. The most commonly known neuraminidase is the viral neuraminidase, a drug target for the prevention of influenza infection. Sialidases catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues from the newly formed virions and from the host cell receptors. Sialidase activities include assistance in the mobility of virus particles through the respiratory tract mucus and in the elution of virion progeny from the infected cell.",

In case of Serpin A1, the disappearance of hypersialylated Serpin A1 isoforms, preferably the Serpin A1 isoforms with the lowest pI (e.g. with an pI in the range of 4.5 and 5), more preferably the one or two Serpin A1 isoforms with the lowest pI (e.g. with an pI in the range of 4.5 and 5), compared to a control sample (not treated with sialidase enzyme), is a sign for the presence of PDD (see examples, particularly FIG. 5).",

If the enzyme sialidase is used, the following generally applies: Sialic acid leads to an acidification of the protein by giving it a more negative charge which in turn requires a more acidic pH to be neutralized in the IEF gel/strip. When the sialic acid residues are removed, the protein will be less negatively charged, thus, requiring a less acidic pH for neutralization. This leads to a shift to a more basic pI.",

Finally, the number of the detected glycosylated isoforms, e.g. Serpin A1 isoforms, is determined and compared to a control (see above). If, for example, the number of the detected Serpin A1 isoforms exceeds 5, as 6 or 7 isoforms could be detected, the subject tested is identified as experiencing PDD.",

                        "A means for isoelectric focusing (IEF) or 2D gel electrophoresis preferably separates Serpin A1 isoforms, particularly differentially sialylated Serpin A1 isoforms, allowing the identification of the number of Serpin A1 isoforms occurring in subjects which may suffer from PDD and preferably also those occurring in control subjects. Examples of means for isoelectric focusing (IEF) are immobilized pH gradient (iPG) gels, iPG strips, preferably dry and rehydratable iPG strips, and microfluidic chip based isoelectric focusing (Sommer and Hatch, Electrophoresis. 2009 March; 30(5):742-5.).",
                        "The enzyme sialidase (also designated as neuroamidase) may also be comprised in said means. As already described above, the enzyme sialidase (also designated as neuroamidase) is able to digest terminal sialic, oligosialic and polysialic acids and can, thus, be used for the additional detection of a shift of differentially sialylated Ser/Thr motive comprising proteins, particularly Serpin A1, towards a more basic isoelectric point (pI) on a 1D gel with IEF as first dimension or 2D gel with IEF as second dimension. In case of Serpin A1, the disappearance of hypersialylated Serpin A1 isoforms, preferably the Serpin A1 isoforms with the lowest pI (e.g. with an pI in the range of 4.5 and 5), more preferably the one or two Serpin A1 isoforms with the lowest pI (e.g. with an pI in the range of 4.5 and 5), compared to a control sample (not treated with sialidase enzyme), is a sign for the presence of PDD (see examples, particularly FIG. 5).",
                        "As mentioned above, isoelectric focusing (IEF) allows the separation of proteins according to their isoelectric point (pI). In detail, a protein that is in a pH region below its isoelectric point (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate towards the cathode. As it migrates through a gradient of increasing pH, however, the protein's overall charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI (neutral stage, where the overall charge of the protein is 0). At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases (as there is no electrical attraction towards either electrode). As a result, the proteins become focused into sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. The technique of isoelectric focusing (IEF) is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.",
                        "If the enzyme sialidase is used, the following generally applies: Sialic acid leads to an acidification of the protein by giving it a more negative charge which in turn requires a more acidic pH to be neutralized in the IEF gel/strip. When the sialic acid residues are removed, the protein will be less negatively charged, thus, requiring a less acidic pH for neutralization. This leads to a shift to a more basic pI.",

Samples were not pooled but 2 patients of different groups were loaded onto a gel together with the internal standard so that altogether 18 gels were analysed. Also a dye-switch was made to exclude false results due to preferential binding of certain proteins to one dye. A representative gel is shown in FIG. 1. Relevant regulated proteins were identified using MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis. Spot data for the identified proteins are shown in Table 2.

Using this cut-off, PD and PDD were compared and a diagnostic sensitivity of 91.6% and a specificity of 100% by 2D immunoblot approach were found.

Wolters, Recognition and management of Parkinson's disease during the premotor (prodromal) phase. Expert Rev Neurother, 2009. 9(6): p. 847-57). Since the typical Parkinson symptoms are initially predominant, the cognitive impairments or even a dementia is often neglected or delayed detected in advanced stages (Dubois, B. and B. Pillon, Cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease. J Neurol, 1997. 244(1): p. 2-8; Poewe, W., et al., Diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease dementia. Int J Clin Pract, 2008. 62(10): p. 1581-7). In order to identify PD patients who are at risk to develop a dementia, a laboratory marker was of great advantage.",
                                "In this example, CSF-analysis of patients with PD and PDD was performed using proteomic methods in order to detect proteins of potential diagnostic value. The serine-protease-inhibitor Serpin A1 could be verified with biochemical methods to be statistically significant regulated\u2014a protein that was already described to be relevant in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy-bodies (Nielsen, H. M., et al., Plasma and CSF serpins in Alzheimer disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Neurology, 2007. 69(16): p. 1569-79). In addition, the isoform-distribution of Serpin A1 was characterized and a different protein-pattern with 6 or more spots in PDD and with 5 spots or less in PD and CON was identified, wherein spots 1 and/or 2 were indicative for differentiation with 100% sensitivity for PDD. These results could be verified in a larger cohort of patients of three different specialized centres (Ulm/Germany, Perugia/Italy and Kuopio/Finland) whereby two PD cases presented the 6 spot-pattern which interestingly developed a dementia in the course of their disease. Thus, the isoform-pattern does not only help to support the diagnosis of PDD but has also a predictive value."

Here, Serpin A1 was detected in all 7 spots from a representative gel of a PDD-patient being the dominant protein in spots 1 through 5. Serpin A1 was also detected in spots 6 and 7 but the dominant protein was identified as GC vitamin D-binding protein precursor (see FIG. 2B).",

Glycosylations were detected for spots 3 to 7 but not for spots 1 and 2 (see Table 3) which are the diagnostic relevant ones to differentiate between PD and PDD. As this does not necessarily mean that there are no glycosylations in spots 1 and 2, a PNGase F digest was performed that detected all Serpin A1 spots in a PDD-patient to harbour N-glycosylations (see FIG. 6). However, as the additional Serpin A1 spots are still present after PNGase F treatment, N-linked glycans (or more precisely their terminal sialic acids) cannot be responsible for the altered charge states. It was therefore hypothesized that sialylated O-linked glycans may be the underlying posttranslational modifications for the characteristic Serpin A1 spot pattern. This hypothesis was tested by performing a neuraminidase-digest. A shift of the Serpin A1 isoforms towards a more basic pI (see FIG. 5) was indeed found. Most importantly, the diagnostic relevant acidic spots disappeared, indicating a hypersialylation of those isoforms.",

                                "This hypersialylation is not due to a decrease of neuraminidase (enzyme responsible for desialylation) in CSF, since its activity in CSF remains unchanged (data not shown in detail).

As glycosylation processes can be identified on N-linked or on O-linked glycans, both enzymes responsible for this, PNGase F and neuraminidase, were tested. PNGase F is able to remove N-linked glycans and neuraminidase is able to remove terminal sialylation from N- and O-linked glycans. Only treatment with the latter resulted not only in a shift of the Serpin A1 isoforms towards a more basic pI but also in the disappearance of the two relevant (most) acidic spots in PDD, indicating an O-linked hypersialylation of those isoforms (by neuraminidase) to be responsible for altered charged states. Thereby, hypersialylation does not seem to be traced back to a decrease in sialidase-activity (neuraminidase), as activity of this enzyme does not change in the CSF of any of the groups analysed.",
