    "title": "Polymer-tetrodotoxin conjugates to induce prolonged duration local anesthesia with minimal toxicity",
    "date": "2019-06-12",
    "abstract": "There is clinical and scientific interest in developing local anesthetics with prolonged durations of effect from single injections. The need for such is highlighted by the current opioid epidemic. Site 1 sodium channel blockers such as tetrodotoxin (TTX) are extremely potent, and can provide very long nerve blocks but the duration is limited by the associated systemic toxicity. Here we report a system where slow release of TTX conjugated to a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, poly(triol dicarboxylic acid)-co-poly(ethylene glycol) (TDP), is achieved by hydrolysis of ester linkages. Nerve block by the released TTX is enhanced by administration in a carrier with chemical permeation enhancer (CPE) properties. TTX release can be adjusted by tuning the hydrophilicity of the TDP polymer backbone. In vivo, 1.0\u201380.0 \u00b5g of TTX released from these polymers produced a range of durations of nerve block, from several hours to 3 days, with minimal systemic or local toxicity.",

                "Opioids are often the mainstay of perioperative and chronic pain management, even with relatively localized pain. Opioids have numerous side effects, including nausea, clouding of the sensorium, pruritus, urinary retention, and constipation. More seriously, opioid therapy often results in tolerance, addiction, diversion, and fatal overdose. Opioids are often delivered systemically, and act predominantly on the central nervous system, the origin of the major side effects. Consequently, there has been growing interest in local and regional approaches to treating pain.",
                "Conventional amino-amide and amino-ester local anesthetics are the principal compounds used for local and regional anesthesia1,2. Although these compounds are effective, their durations of action are relatively short, and they can cause severe cardiovascular and neurologic systemic side effects1,3. Encapsulation in sustained release systems can prolong the duration of nerve blockade of conventional local anesthetics, and can greatly mitigate systemic effect. However, it can exacerbate the intrinsic myo- and neurotoxicity of conventional local anesthetics, and can leave debris at the nerve, causing inflammation that can outlast the duration of nerve blockade1,3,4.",
                "Given these limitations, it has been a long-standing goal to develop a local anesthetic sustained release system that can provide prolonged peripheral nerve blockade with minimal systemic and local side effects. Naturally occurring site 1 sodium channel blockers (S1SCBs), such as tetrodotoxin (TTX), have been studied for this purpose, as they are extremely potent and cause minimal local toxicity5. Consequently, S1SCBs are being investigated clinically for local anesthesia6,7. However, the dosing of S1SCBs, and therefore the maximal durations of block achievable, can be limited by systemic toxicity8. Mitigation of that toxicity by encapsulation is challenging due to the hydrophilicity of S1SCBs; in particular the initial burst release can be dose-limiting9,10. We have hypothesized that covalent conjugation of TTX onto a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer backbone via a hydrolyzable ester linkage would prevent the initial burst release of TTX, and that the slow hydrolysis of ester bonds would achieve sustained release of TTX in its native, biologically active form. Since the hydrophilicity of polymers is a primary determinant of the hydrolysis rate of ester bonds and therefore the TTX release from these polymers, the TTX release rate could be tailored by altering the hydrophilicity of the polymer backbone11.",
                "We hypothesized that safety and efficacy could be enhanced by minimizing the amount of S1SCB released\u2014even to subanesthetic levels\u2014but to additionally provide a means of enhancing the effectiveness of released drug to anesthetic levels (Fig.\u00a01a). The approach we selected was based on the fact that only a very small fraction (perhaps 0.05%) of S1SCBs applied outside a nerve bundle penetrates to the axonal surface4. The penetration of S1SCBs into nerve can be enhanced by chemical permeation enhancers\u00a0(CPEs)12,13, a heterogeneous group of (usually) small molecules that can help drugs cross biological barriers14.Fig. 1Design of a sustained release system for prolonged duration local anesthesia. a A polymer\u2013TTX conjugate, designed to have a large TTX content with slow release, is placed near a nerve. Flux of TTX into the nerve is enhanced by a delivery system that acts as a chemical permeation enhancer. The polymer\u2013TTX conjugate, schematized here as a hyperbranched structure has a much higher TTX loading than those actually produced here (which have 0.008 or 0.03 TTX molecules on each polymer chain). b Steglich esterification to synthesize TDP and TDP\u2013TTX. The first step is optional, depending on whether the PEG moiety needs to be incorporated into the polymer",
                "Here, we selected TTX as the model S1SCB as it is commercially available. For the sustained release component of this system, we designed a family of biodegradable poly(triol dicarboxylic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) (TDP) polymers, to which TTX would be covalently conjugated by ester bonds. We investigated the release of TTX in its native state from the polymers, as a function of monomer composition and polymer hydrophilicity, and studied anesthetic efficacy and toxicity in relation to those properties. The family of polymers so developed could produce nerve blocks in vivo lasting hours to days with minimal local and systemic toxicities."

                        "TDP polymers were synthesized from dicarboxylic acids, triols, and hydroxyl poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The dicarboxylic acids provide carboxyl groups for TTX conjugation. The three hydroxyl groups of the triols allow the possibility of forming hyperbranched polymers. Hyperbranched TDP would terminate with multiple carboxyl groups, to which TTX could be covalently conjugated via ester bonds. TTX could be subsequently released via the hydrolysis of those bonds (Fig.\u00a01a). The hydrophilicity of TDP polymers and hence the TTX release rate could be regulated by tuning the composition of monomers.",
                        "The TDP polymers were formed via Steglich esterification at room temperature (Fig.\u00a01b, Supplementary Table\u00a01). The hydrophilicity of the polymers was modified by using a hydrophilic (glycerol) or hydrophobic (polycaprolactone,\u00a0PCL) triol, altering the number of carbons (1, 5, or 8) in the aliphatic chain of dicarboxylic acid, and varying the molecular weight of PEG. The nomenclature of synthesized TDP polymers will be TxDyPz, where x represents the type of triol (g is glycerol, c is PCL triol), y represents the number of carbons in the aliphatic chain of dicarboxylic acid, and z represents the molecular weight of PEG (200, 1000, 2000\u2009Da) (Table\u00a01). The presence of glycerol and PEG within TDP polymers was intended to increase the hydrophilic fraction (fphil) of the polymers, defined as the weight percentage of glycerol and PEG within the TDP polymer.Table 1Characterization of TDP polymersNameafphil (%)bDicarboxylic acidTriolPEGMncMwcPDIcTgD8P200083.5Sebacic acidGlycerolPEG2000664311,2341.691TgD8P100072.1Sebacic acidGlycerolPEG1000557876721.375TgD8P20037.8Sebacic acidGlycerolPEG200447070811.584TgD134.0Malonic acidGlycerol\u2013456711,6282.546TgD528.9Glutaric acidGlycerol\u2013596216,5952.783TgD821.0Sebacic acidGlycerol\u2013601116,5642.756TcD80Sebacic acidPCL triold\u2013612617,0732.787aThe polymer names are abbreviated or simplified as described in the main textbHydrophilic fraction of the polymers (fphil): weight percentage of PEG and glycerol within the polymercAs determined by GPCdPCL triol\u2009=\u2009polycaprolactone triol",

                        "To avoid drug degradation, Steglich esterification, which occurs at room temperature, was selected for the synthesis of TDP\u2013TTX conjugates (Fig.\u00a01b). DMSO was chosen as the solvent because TTX had its highest solubility in DMSO (10\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) among the tested organic solvents (Supplementary Table\u00a02). 1\u20134\u2009mg (0.003\u20130.012\u2009mmol) of TTX was added into the reaction mixture (see Methods, Table\u00a02). Only a small amount of TTX was originally dissolved in DMSO and participated in the reaction. However, as the Steglich esterification reaction proceeded and dissolved TTX was conjugated to TDP polymer, the solution equilibrium drove more TTX to dissolve and participate in the reaction. To achieve a high proportion of binding of TTX to TDP, TTX was reacted with excess TDP polymers (Table\u00a02), the reaction occurred at room temperature for 7 days, and TDP\u2013TTX conjugates were collected as yellowish solids. The proportion of bound TTX was determined by measuring the unbound TTX in the reaction mixture by ELISA. >99.0% of the TTX was conjugated to TDP polymer (Table\u00a02, Supplementary Table\u00a03). Given the potency of TTX, milligram quantities of TTX were conjugated to gram quantities of TDP polymers.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed a peak at ~5.0\u2009min in release samples and the TTX standard (Fig.\u00a02f). Mass spectra confirmed that the molecular weight of the molecule at this retention time corresponded to that of TTX (m/z 320.1 is [TTX\u2009+\u2009H]+) (Fig.\u00a02g), indicating that TTX was released in its native form. All TDP\u2013TTX conjugates significantly increased the duration of TTX release compared to free TTX (Fig.\u00a02h, i). TTX release followed a near linear profile at lower values of fphil (TgD8\u2013TTX and TgD8P200\u2013TTX), suggesting the potential to release TTX at a constant rate for prolonged local anesthesia with minimal systemic toxicity. As the fphil decreased from 83.5 to 0%, the TTX release half-time increased from 25\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009h to 723\u2009\u00b1\u200975\u2009h.",

To investigate whether PEG200 acted as a CPE, fluorescein sodium (excitation 460\u2009nm, emission 515\u2009nm) was used as a proxy for TTX because both are very hydrophilic. Animals were injected at the rat sciatic nerve with 0.25\u2009mg of fluorescein sodium in 0.5\u2009mL of PEG200 or PBS. One or four hours later, animals were euthanized and the sciatic nerve and surrounding tissue were harvested. Frozen sections of the nerve were produced, the nuclei stained, and fluorescent images taken (Fig.\u00a04). No fluorescence was observed in the nerve in animals injected with fluorescein sodium in PBS at either time point. In animals injected with fluorescein sodium in PEG200, fluorescence was observed throughout the nerve 1\u2009h after injection, but none 4\u2009h after injection. These results demonstrated that PEG200 can act as a CPE, to help molecules penetrate into the nerve. Since PEG200 acted as a CPE, and it was needed to solubilize the polymers to make them injectable, it was used as the CPE in subsequent experiments.Fig. 4Representative fluorescence images of sections of sciatic nerves and surrounding tissues. Tissues were harvested 1 and 4\u2009h after injection of 0.25\u2009mg of fluorescein sodium in 0.5\u2009mL of PEG200 or PBS. Arrows indicate fluorescein sodium (green). Blue: cell nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole (DAPI). Data are representative of 4 animals in each group. Scale bars, 100\u2009\u00b5m",
                        "To enhance safety and prolong release of TTX from TDP\u2013TTX for a given loading, we selected TgD8\u2013TTX/PEG200 for in vivo testing. Animals were injected at the left sciatic nerve with 2.5\u201325\u2009mg of TgD8\u2013TTX containing 1\u201310\u2009\u00b5g of TTX, or, if higher doses were needed, with 12.5\u201350\u2009mg of TgD8\u2013TTXH containing 20\u201380\u2009\u00b5g of TTX (Supplementary Table\u00a07), in 0.5\u2009mL of PEG200. TgD8\u2013TTXH was used in order to be able to increase the TTX dose without excessive increases in the mass of polymer injected. TTX release kinetics from TgD8\u2013TTX and TgD8\u2013TTXH were similar (p\u2009>\u20090.05, one-way ANOVA) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011), perhaps because the loading of TTX (1.6% of total mass) was still very low.",
                        "Efficacy, safety, and nerve block duration were greatly enhanced by covalent incorporation of TTX in TgD8/PEG200 (Fig.\u00a03a, b). Sensory block success and duration increased with increasing doses of conjugated TTX. In particular, TgD8\u2013TTX/PEG200 enhanced the efficacy of small doses of TTX, e.g., enabling 2\u2009\u00b5g (12\u2009\u00b5M) of conjugated TTX in TgD8\u2013TTX/PEG200 to produce block with 100% success, and a median block duration of 5.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009h (p\u2009\u00ab\u20090.001 compared to block duration from 2\u2009\u00b5g of free TTX, one-way ANOVA). In addition, TgD8\u2013TTX/PEG200 significantly increased the safety of TTX as evidenced by the absence of toxicity after injection of high doses of TTX. For example, sensory nerve block with 80\u2009\u00b5g (480\u2009\u00b5M) of TTX conjugated in TgD8\u2013TTXH/PEG200 lasted 71.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009h (approximately 3 days; Fig.\u00a03b) and no animals died or had contralateral deficits (Fig.\u00a03c, d). That dose of TTX was 16-fold higher than the dose of free TTX that was uniformly fatal. Moreover, in this animal model it is not possible, due to limiting toxicity, to achieve such long nerve blocks with TTX in the absence of sustained release4, CPEs12,13, and/or drugs that enhance the effect of S1SCBs9,21. Motor block was not statistically significantly longer than sensory block at any dose of conjugated TTX (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09b).",
                        "The unconjugated mixture of TgD8 with free TTX in PEG200 provided similar nerve block and toxicity as did free TTX in PEG200 (Supplementary Table\u00a06), indicating that the covalent bonding of TTX to TgD8 had a marked impact on nerve block and safety (Supplementary Note\u00a01), and that TgD8 had no CPE-like effect (Supplementary Note\u00a02). Separate experiments showed that nerve block depended on both the sustained release of TTX from TgD8\u2013TTXH and the CPE effect of PEG200 (Supplementary Note\u00a03).",
                        "A crucial hypothesis underlying this work was that TTX bound to a polymer would be inactive. To test this hypothesis, 10\u2009\u03bcg of TTX conjugated to TgD8 via urethane bonds were injected at the sciatic nerve. No sensory or motor nerve blockade was produced in any of the animals tested (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c). These results indicated that TTX had no biological activity when covalently conjugated onto a polymer backbone.",
                        "To address the possibility that the enhanced nerve block with TgD8\u2013TTX/PEG200 was due to translocation of TgD8\u2013TTX into the sciatic nerve, we labeled TgD8 with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, excitation 488\u2009nm and emission 519\u2009nm) and injected animals with FITC-labeled TgD8 in 0.5\u2009mL PEG200. The FITC was covalently conjugated (see Methods) to TgD8 so that the dye would not be able to diffuse independently of the polymer: the labeled polymer is denoted FITC\u2013TgD8. At predetermined time points after injection, animals were euthanized and the nerves and surrounding tissues processed for histology. Fluorescent confocal microscopy showed FITC in the connective tissue between muscle and nerve 24, 48, and 168\u2009h after injection, but not within the sciatic nerve itself (Fig.\u00a05a).Fig. 5Retention in tissue of fluorescently labeled TgD8 injected at the sciatic nerve. a Representative fluorescent confocal photomicrographs 24, 48, and 168\u2009h after sciatic nerve injection of 25\u2009mg of FITC\u2013TgD8 in 0.5\u2009mL of PEG200.

                        "To evaluate the time course of local retention of TDP in tissue, we injected animals with TgD8/PEG200 to which Cy5.5 (excitation 684\u2009nm, emission 710\u2009nm) was covalently conjugated; the polymer is denoted Cy5.5\u2013TgD8. Fluorescent images were taken by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). A fluorescent signal was seen at the sciatic nerve of all animals, with no detectable fluorescence elsewhere (Fig.\u00a05b). The fluorescence signal decreased over 4 weeks, indicating the gradual degradation of TgD8 (Fig.\u00a05b, c). On necropsy 24\u2009h after injection, visible deposits were located at the sciatic nerve; these were fluorescent, confirming that they contained TgD8 (Fig.\u00a05d).",
                        "Since the fphil of TDP polymers determined the TTX release rate from TDP\u2013TTX conjugates in vitro, we hypothesized that it would determine the toxicity and efficacy of the formulations in vivo. To test our hypothesis, animals were injected at the left sciatic nerve with TD\u2013TTX/PEG200 or TDP\u2013TTX/PEG200 conjugates with various fphil containing 1 (6\u2009\u00b5M) or 10\u2009\u00b5g (60\u2009\u00b5M) of TTX (Supplementary Table\u00a07). In animals injected with 1\u2009\u00b5g of conjugated TTX, the frequency of successful blocks and the block duration increased with increasing fphil (Fig.\u00a06a, b). In animals injected with 10\u2009\u00b5g of conjugated TTX, the toxicity (sensory deficits in the uninjected [contralateral] leg and mortality) increased, while the block duration decreased with increasing fphil (Fig.\u00a06c, d). These results demonstrated that the fphil of TDP polymers determined the efficacy and toxicity of the formulations. At a low dose of TTX (1\u2009\u00b5g conjugated to TDP polymers), a relatively rapid release of TTX was required to achieve and maintain the tissue level of anesthetic required to provide nerve block. This was more readily achieved with molecules with a high fphil, which have more rapid drug release. However, at a high dose of conjugated TTX (10\u2009\u00b5g), where the concentration of released TTX readily achieved that needed for effective nerve block, more rapid release of TTX could cause systemic toxicity, and a shorter duration of effect. Therefore, at higher TTX doses a lower fphil would enable a slower rate of TTX release to minimize systemic toxicity and prolong block duration.Fig. 6Effects of fphil (%) on efficacy and toxicity of sciatic nerve block. a Frequency of successful blocks, b duration of sensory nerve blocks, c frequency of nerve blocks in the uninjected (contralateral) extremity, and d animal mortality. Animals were injected with 1 or 10\u2009\u00b5g of conjugated TTX in TD\u2013TTX/PEG200 or TDP\u2013TTX/PEG200.\u00a0Data are means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20094",
                        "Since inadvertent intravascular injection can cause systemic anesthetic toxicity, the safety of intravenous polymer\u2013TTX/PEG200 was assessed. TgD8-TTXH/PEG200 solution (50\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 TgD8\u2013TTXH) was diluted 1:1 in PBS containing 10\u2009wt% BSA, to a final concentration of 25\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 TgD8\u2013TTXH. 0.5\u2009mL of the formulation (12.5\u2009mg of TgD8\u2013TTXH) containing 20\u2009\u00b5g (120\u2009\u00b5M) of TTX was injected intravenously. There were no neurobehavioral deficits at the sciatic nerve (which would reflect systemic toxicity) or other signs of toxicity, including animal death (Supplementary Table\u00a09). Notably, 20\u2009\u00b5g of intravenous TTX is enough to kill many rats, since the LD50 of intravenous TTX is 2\u201310\u2009\u00b5g\u2009kg\u22121 in mammals22, i.e., 0.7\u20133.5\u2009\u00b5g in a 350\u2009g rat."

Minimal peripheral injury (decreased density of axons) involving <5% of the nerve, was detected at 4 days\u00a0in 1 of 3\u00a0rats injected with TgD8\u2013TTXH/PEG200 (Fig.\u00a07e, f).",
                        "That minimal nerve injury was due to the high concentration of PEG200 (5.62\u2009M, i.e., pure) used to disperse the TgD8\u2013TTXH, as evidenced by comparable minimal nerve injury present at 4 days in 3 of 3 rats injected with 0.5\u2009mL of pure PEG200 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012a, b). We eliminated the minimal nerve injury by reformulating the injection solution. We selected compounds for the following properties: (a) ability to disperse the TTX-polymer conjugate, (b) activity as a CPE, (c) liquidity at room temperature, (d) lack of toxicity. Poly(propylene glycol) (4000\u2009Da, PPG4000) was found to cause no nerve damage, which is consistent with reports on the safety of high molecular weight poly(propylene glycol) (2000 Da or greater)23. Nerve histology was normal in all rats injected with 0.5\u2009mL of pure PPG4000 at 4 days (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012c). However, injection of TgD8\u2013TTXH in PPG4000 containing up to 80\u2009\u00b5g (480\u2009\u00b5M) of TTX did not result in nerve block in rats, due to the poor CPE effect of PPG4000: confocal imaging showed that PPG4000 did not facilitate the penetration of fluorescein sodium into sciatic nerves (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). Consequently, we combined PPG4000 (95\u2009v%) acting as an inert carrier with 5\u2009v% PEG200 (281\u2009mM) as the active CPE. Injection of TgD8\u2013TTXH containing 40\u2009\u00b5g of TTX in 5% PEG200/95% PPG4000 induced nerve block lasting 64.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.6\u2009h, similar to that resulting from the TgD8\u2013TTXH/PEG200 formulation (p\u2009=\u20090.88, one-way ANOVA).

                "We had conjectured that prolonged duration local anesthesia could be achieved without significant systemic or local toxicity by combining a sustained release system eluting drug at a subtherapeutic level, with a CPE to enhance the effect of the released anesthetic. For sustained release, we developed biodegradable polymer\u2013TTX conjugates; for the CPE we used a mixture containing 5\u2009v% of PEG200 and 95\u2009v% of PPG4000. This combination of materials with distinct properties was able to provide prolonged local anesthesia with no systemic toxicity.",
                "Animal testing confirmed that TDP\u2013TTX/PEG200 could significantly broaden the therapeutic index of TTX, i.e., reducing toxicity while increasing efficacy. All TDP\u2013TTX/PEG200 formulations significantly increased the safety of TTX (Fig.\u00a03, Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). In particular, TgD8-TTXH/PEG200 allowed the injection of up to 80\u2009\u00b5g of TTX without systemic toxicity; TDP\u2013TTX/PEG200 was able to increase the efficacy of TTX,\u00a0i.e. increasing the duration of nerve block that could be achieved and enhancing the effectiveness of small doses of TTX (e.g. enabling 1\u2009\u00b5g of TTX to produce nerve blockade).",
                "Hydrolyzable covalent bonds have been used to create drug conjugates for controlled drug release due to their excellent control over release rates and avoidance of burst release19,20. However, for a specific drug, precise control of the hydrolysis rate of the covalent bonds is required to maintain drugs level within a therapeutic window. TTX has a very narrow therapeutic window24 (Fig.\u00a03a), which requires control of the TTX release rate to avoid systemic toxicity while prolonging block. To achieve this goal, TDP polymers with adjustable backbone hydrophilicity and therefore a tunable hydrolysis rate of ester bond were developed. Synthesis of a library of TDP\u2013TTX conjugates with various TTX release rates, allowed the identification of TDP\u2013TTX conjugates with desired characteristics.",
                "Given their adjustable hydrophilicity, and their multiple hydroxyl and carboxyl ending groups, the TDP polymers have the potential to be a platform for reversible binding of a wide range of drugs with hydroxyl or carboxyl groups (such as dexamethasone, above). For highly potent drugs, such as TTX, TDP polymers with a lower fphil may be preferred to achieve slow drug release. For drugs of lower potency, TDP polymers with a higher fphil may be required to achieve a faster drug release rate.",
                "TDP\u2013TTX conjugates were biodegradable and tissue reaction was benign. All monomers used for the synthesis of TDP\u2013TTX conjugates, including glycerol25, polycaprolactone26, dicarboxylic acid25, and PEG27 have excellent biocompatibility. TDP\u2013TTX conjugates should gradually degrade into intermediates, e.g., TTX in its native form or linked to a small segment of TDP chains, which would eventually hydrolyze off.",
                "PEG200, a solvent with low toxicity, has been widely used in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations as a medium for hydrophobic pharmaceuticals19. We discovered that PEG200 was both a vehicle and a CPE. PEG200 enhanced TTX flux into nerve and enhanced the effectiveness of TTX, probably due to its amphiphilic nature28,29. Pure PEG200 caused minimal nerve injury. However, the minimal nerve injury was avoided completely by using a low yet effective concentration of PEG200 combined with PPG4000.",
                "The TDP\u2013TTX conjugate would be easy to scale up, weigh, and store for the future clinical applications. Milligram quantities of TTX were conjugated to gram quantities of TgD8\u2013TTXH (4\u2009mg of TTX in 2500\u2009mg of TgD8\u2013TTXH, Table\u00a02). Such a batch would allow the delivery of 100 doses of 25\u2009mg of TgD8-TTXH containing 40\u2009\u00b5g of TTX, which produced a duration of nerve block up to 63.2\u2009\u00b1\u20099.8\u2009h in a rat (Fig.\u00a03b). The reaction could be further scaled up without decreasing the proportion of binding of TTX to TgD8 polymer due to excess of TgD8 in the reaction mixture. The synthesized TgD8-TTX conjugate is solid, which could be easily stored at room temperature in a dry environment.",
                "The formulations developed here would likely be even safer and provide longer blocks in larger animals such as humans. The rationale behind that hypothesis is that toxicity of a systemically distributed drug (TTX in this case) tracks fairly well with animal mass, while local anesthetic effect has a much weaker relationship to body size4. Therefore, while a sciatic nerve block in a 70\u2009kg human may require more active material than in a 350\u2009g rat, that increment will likely be much smaller than the 200-fold decrease in systemic toxicity in the human. In addition to this potential increase in the therapeutic index, it is likely that it will be possible to deliver much more material in a larger animal. Thus, for example, rat sciatic nerve block with bupivacaine-dexamethasone polymeric microspheres lasted a few days30, and lasted 10 days in sheep intercostal blocks31.",
                "The TgD8\u2013TTX/PEG200 formulation enables great dose flexibility. The TTX loading of TgD8-TTXH (1.60\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mg\u22121, 0.03 TTX molecules on each polymer chain) is still very low. If TgD8-TTX conjugates with higher loadings of TTX were required, that could be readily achieved by simply feeding larger amounts of TTX into the reaction, since the polymer component is present in excess. It should also be possible to substitute other S1SCB\u2014such as the saxitoxins24\u2014for TTX, since those also have hydroxyl groups available for reaction to the polymers. Nerve block durations even longer than those reported in this work could be achieved using approaches such as enhancing local retention (Supplementary Discussion\u00a01) and co-administration/co-delivery with other drugs (Supplementary Discussion\u00a02).",
                "In conclusion, a local anesthetic system was developed that provided hours to days of nerve block with minimal local or systemic toxicity. The design entailed two key components: a rationally designed TDP\u2013TTX conjugate that provided precise control of TTX release at a safe rate, and a CPE increasing TTX flux into nerve."

The inflammation score was a subjective assessment of severity (0: no inflammation, 1: peripheral inflammation, 2: deep inflammation, 3: muscular hemifascicular inflammation, 4: muscular holofascicular inflammation). The myotoxicity score reflected two characteristic features of local anesthetic myotoxicity: nuclear internalization and regeneration. Nuclear internalization is characterized by myocytes normal in size and chromicity, but with nuclei located away from their usual location at the periphery of the cell9. Regeneration is characterized by shrunken myocytes: cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. Scoring was as follows: 0. normal; 1. perifascicular internalization; 2. deep internalization (>5 cell layers), 3. perifascicular regeneration, 4. deep regeneration (>5 cell layers), 5. hemifascicular regeneration, 6. holofascicular regeneration.
