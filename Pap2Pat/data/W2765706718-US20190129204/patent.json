                        "Meanwhile, the number of persons with myopia is reportedly still increasing worldwide. Myopia includes refractive myopia and axial myopia, many cases being axial myopia. With axial myopia, myopia progresses in association with elongation of an axial length of the eye, and the elongation is irreversible (Morgan IG et al., Lancet, 2012). When myopia progresses, high myopia occurs, and high myopia is known as the leading cause of blindness (Iwase A. et al., Ophthalmology, 2006). For this reason, there has been strong demand for means for preventing the occurrence of myopia and means for suppressing the progression of myopia."

                                "The myopia prevention device according to the present invention comprises the light emission part that emits light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive. The light emission part emits light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive and acts so as to suppress the occurrence and progression of myopia. Specific examples of the myopia prevention device that comprises the light emission part are as follows, but the present invention is not limited thereto: lighting equipment (room lights, lights inside vehicles, lights inside airplanes, street lights, floor lamps, spotlights, and the like), display screens provided to various display devices (for example, televisions, PC monitors, gaming devices, portable media players, cell phones, tablet terminals, wearable devices, 3D glasses, virtual glasses, mobile book readers, car navigation systems, digital cameras, monitors inside vehicles, monitors inside airplanes, and the like), and light irradiation devices used for myopia prevention.",
                                "The light emission part may further produce light having a wavelength greater than 400 nm. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 11, the light emission part may emit light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive in combination with light having a wavelength greater than 400 nm. Light having a wavelength greater than 400 nm may be emitted from a light emission part other than the light emission part that emits light having a wavelength of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, or may be emitted along with the light having a wavelength of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive from the same light emission part. With light having a wavelength greater than 400 nm, the hue of the overall light emitted from one or two or more light emission parts can be adjusted depending on the wavelength range of the light, and thus preferably light of the specified wavelength range corresponding to the desired hue is emitted.",
                                "Examples of such a light emission part include the light-emitting device illustrated in FIG. 18. The light-emitting device illustrated in FIG. 18 comprises a light emission part (LED) that emits excitation light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive. This light-emitting device is a configuration example with an excitation light emission part (LED) that emits excitation light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, and fluorescent substances of red, green, and blue provided so as to cover the excitation light emission part. With such a configuration, the fluorescent substances emit white light when the excitation light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive is irradiated on the fluorescent substances. Further, a portion of the light (excitation light) having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive transmits the fluorescent substances as illustrated. Such a light-emitting device can be used as a white light source and as an application for producing the myopia prevention effect.",
                                "Further, examples of such a light emission part also include the light-emitting device illustrated in FIG. 19. The light-emitting device illustrated in FIG. 19 is an RGB light-emitting device comprising a light emission part (LED) that emits light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive. This light-emitting device is a configuration example with the light emission part that emits light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, and light emission parts (LED) of red (R), green (G), and blue (B). Such a configuration results in the advantages of emitting light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive and thus producing the myopia prevention effect, and emitting white light from the RGB light-emitting device and thus being able to utilize the device as a white light source indoors or the like. It should be noted that light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive can be turned ON and OFF as necessary, and can be emitted for a required time to produce the myopia prevention effect when necessary.",
                                "General RGB light-emitting devices can create pseudo white light close to sunlight, but such white light does not substantially include light within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive. Nevertheless, the light-emitting devices illustrated in FIG. 18 and FIG. 19 are capable of emitting light within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive and constitute non-pseudo white light (natural light) close to sunlight having a broad spectral width, and produce the exceptional effect of selectively emitting light within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, which particularly has the myopia prevention effect. It should be noted that white light may be emitted using the means illustrated in FIG. 18 and FIG. 19, or may be emitted using other means. Examples of other means include a light-emitting device (B not included) made of R (red) and G (green) for which light emission wavelengths are controlled.",
                                "Further, when the myopia prevention device comprises the light emission part that emits light having a wavelength of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, preferably light having a wavelength less than 350 nm is not produced (refer to FIG. 4 and FIG. 11). It should be noted that, more preferably, even if light less than 350 nm is slightly emitted in a noise-like manner, light having a wavelength of 315 nm or less that may be harmful to the eye is not emitted.",
                                "The irradiance at which the light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive and emitted from the light emission part reaches the eye is not particularly limited, but may be 5.0 mW/cm2 or less. The preferred irradiance is 3.0 mW/cm2 or less. On the other hand, the irradiance is preferably set taking into consideration the effect on the human eye and skin. When light is emitted toward a person for a long period of time for the purpose of myopia prevention, the irradiance relates to the light emission time as well, and may be increased if the time is short, but is preferably decreased if the time is long. The irradiance is preferably 1.0 mW/cm2 or less, and is preferably decreased to 0.5 mW/cm2 or less, 0.1 mW/cm2 or less, and 0.05 mW/cm2 or less as the time increases. The irradiance can be measured using a known method. It should be noted that \u201cirradiance\u201d means the intensity of the light that enters or reaches the eye.",
                                "It should be noted that the myopia prevention device comprising the light emission part according to the present invention may be a myopia prevention set combined with the myopia prevention device comprising the light transmission part described above. Accordingly, a more superior myopia prevention effect is exhibited more safely. When the devices are combined, the irradiance of the light emitted from the light emission part may be adjusted in accordance with the light transmission characteristics of the myopia prevention device comprising the light transmission part. For example, when the light transmission part controls the permeability of light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, the irradiance emitted from the light emission part may be set higher than the irradiance values described above. On the other hand, when the light transmission part does not control the permeability of light having a wavelength within the range of 350 nm to 400 nm inclusive, the irradiance emitted from the light emission part may be adjusted within the range of the irradiance values described above."
