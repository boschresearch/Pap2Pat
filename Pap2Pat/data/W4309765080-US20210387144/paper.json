    "date": "2022-11-23",
    "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have been used for carbon dioxide (CO2 ) capture, however, which have never been used as catalysts to accelerate CO2 capture. The record is broken by a uniquely designed IL, [EMmim][NTf2 ]. The IL can universally catalyze both CO2 sorption and desorption of all the chemisorption-based technologies. As demonstrated in monoethanolamine (MEA) based CO2 capture, even with the addition of only 2000 ppm IL catalyst, the rate of CO2 desorption-the key to reducing the overall CO2 capture energy consumption or breaking the bottleneck of the state-of-the-art technologies and Paris Agreement implementation-can be increased by 791% at 85 \u00b0C, which makes use of low-temperature waste heat and avoids secondary pollution during CO2 capture feasible. Furthermore, the catalytic CO2 capture mechanism is experimentally and theoretically revealed.",

                "Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is critical not only because of its close connection with climate change according to Paris Climate Accord [  1 ,  2 ,  3  ] but also because of its increasing importance as a material and fuel synthesis resource.[  4 ,  5 ,  6  ] Thus, CO2 capture is very important.[  7 ,  8  ] Chemisorption is one of the most important methods for CO2 capture.[  9 ,  10 ,  11  ] The fundamental challenge of chemisorption\u2010based technologies is the slow absorption and desorption reaction kinetics, especially the latter one, which leads to the need for CO2 desorption at >100\u00a0\u00b0C.[  12  ] Consequently, excessive energies are needed to vaporize a large amount of liquid water during CO2 desorption operation and condense the same amount of water vapor prior to CO2 sorption during cyclic CO2 sorption and desorption. Also, severe corrosion and sorbent degradations could result in secondary environmental and health issues, especially when organic amines are used as sorbents.",
                "Thus, is there a way to overcome the fundamental and the associated challenges by desorbing CO2 or regenerating spent sorbents at temperatures less than 100 \u00b0C? This is the pivotal to making use of abundant low quality or waste heats for CO2 desorption feasible, while desired CO2 desorption rates are achievable. Fan et\u00a0al.[  13  ] reported that 20 000\u00a0ppm nanostructured TiO(OH)2 as a heterogeneous catalyst can increase CO2 desorption rate of MEA\u2010based CO2 capture over 4000% at 88\u00a0\u00b0C . However, to date, homogeneous catalysis has not been utilized for CO2 capture.",
                "After a long time of study, a homogeneous CO2 capture catalyst\u2014a new ionic liquid (IL), [CH3COOCH2mim][NTf2], denoted as [EMmim][NTf2]\u2014was discovered. The IL, used as a CO2 capture catalyst instead of a sorbent, is not only very effective for catalyzing CO2 desorption but also CO2 sorption. It should be emphasized that [EMmim][NTf2] is used as a transformative catalyst instead of a sorbent for CO2 capture [  14  ] in this work."

A schematic drawing of this CO2 absorption and desorption experimental setup is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Schematic diagram for synthesizing the IL and its characteristic results are provided in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). The optimal dosage of this catalyst for accelerating CO2 desorption, the key step for reducing overall CO2 capture energy consumption, is 2000\u00a0ppm according to Figure S3 (Supporting Information).",

[EMmin][NTf2] can promote both CO2 absorption and desorption. Capturing 90% CO2 is targeted by the U.S. Department of Energy, and thus the period with 90% CO2 capture efficiency is defined as effective absorption time. According to Figure\u00a01A, 20 wt% MEA sorbent without catalyst can absorb only 144.34\u00a0mmol CO2 within the shorter effective absorption time of 4446 s, while the sorbent with 2000\u00a0ppm IL catalyst can absorb 210.09\u00a0mmol CO2, and extend effective absorption time to 6350 s, which are 45.55% and 42.83% absorption improvements, respectively, compared to the sorbent without catalyst.",
                        "Variations of desorption with time with and without uses of catalyst are illustrated in Figure\u00a01B. The time needed for reaching the maximum desorption rate with the use of [EMmim][NTf2] is shortened by 150 s in comparison to the time required for CO2 desorption without the use of the IL catalyst. Meanwhile, the peak desorption rate improvement is 175%. The increases in desorption rate and the desorbed CO2 amount obtained with [EMmim][NTf2] can reach as high as 791% at 507 s and 534% at 551 s (Figure\u00a01B\u2013D), respectively. The quantities of CO2 desorbed from uncatalytic and catalytic solutions are 18.7 and 28.2\u00a0mmol, respectively. When the absorption time is 7000 s or the outlet CO2 concentrations of both uncatalyzed and catalyzed CO2 absorption are 3.2 vol% (Figure S4, Supporting Information), use of [EMmim][NTf2] can increase the total desorbed CO2 amount by 88.90%. It should be noted that dosage of [EMmim][NTf2] is only 2000\u00a0ppm\u2014the lowest dosage for achieving such significant CO2 capture catalysis effect. To the best knowledge, such a low catalyst dosage has not been reported for achieving such a significant CO2 capture. Also, as a homogeneous catalyst, [EMmim][NTf2] is easy to use. Therefore, [EMmim][NTf2] is quite effective for catalyzing both the CO2 absorption and desorption processes."

                                "The molecular structure of the IL, [EMmim][NTf2] is shown in Figure S2A (Supporting Information). After CO2 absorption, the pH of the capture system decreased from 12.01 to 8.52 (Table\u00a0 1 ), indicating the increase of H+ concentration and promotion of the hydrolysis of the \u2010COOCH3 in [EMmim][NTf2] into \u2014COOH, which is need for catalyzing CO2 desorption. Thus, the activation of [EMmim][NTf2] is accompanied with the enhancement of the acidity of [EMmim][NTf2] after CO2 absorption, as illustrated in Figure  3A. The FT\u2010IR spectra of water, and the 2000\u00a0ppm [EMmim][NTf2] aqueous solution with or without CO2 shown in Figure\u00a03B further confirm this mechanism. Anhydrous CH3OH and CH3COOCH3 as well as CH3COOH and 50% CH3COOH solutions were used to identify the functional groups in the catalytic solutions with or without additions of CO2. The bands around 1381\u20131339 cm\u22121 in the catalytic solutions [Figure\u00a03B (1)] are assigned to the \u2014CH3 group in the IL catalyst (\u2014COOCH3), observed in anhydrous CH3OH, CH3COOCH3 and CH3COOH and 50% CH3COOH solutions. With the increase in the introduced CO2 in the solution, hydrolysis of \u2010COOCH3 is enhanced, leading to increasing the concentration of \u2014CH3 or CH3OH in the catalytic solution as illustrated in Figure\u00a03A. Bands with wavenumbers between 1221\u20131190 cm\u22121 [Figure\u00a03B (2)], detected in anhydrous CH3OH as well, confirm the formation of CH3OH with an enhanced hydrolysis process with CO2. As concentration of \u2014COOCH3 decreases, the \u2014C\u2014O\u2014C peak [1160\u20131128 cm\u22121, Figure\u00a03B (3)] in the catalytic solution with the addition of CO2 was weaker than that of the solution without addition of CO2 according to the reference peaks of anhydrous CH3COOCH3. Consequently, more \u2014COO\u2014 or \u2014COOH formation or more \u2014COOCH3 hydrolysis, was detected within 1079\u20131050 cm\u22121 [Figure\u00a03B (4)], which are concluded from the observations of peaks of anhydrous CH3COOCH3 and CH3COOH, and 50% CH3COOH solution. Also, the acidity of the [EMmim][NTf2] was verified via the measurement of the pH (6.19) of the solution resulting from the addition of 0.2\u00a0g [EMmim][NTf2] to 80\u00a0g H2O (Table\u00a01). The FT\u2010IR spectra of fresh catalytic solution, catalytic solutions after the 1st absorption and the 1st absorption\u2013desorption runs are displayed in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The differences in the changes of the quantities of CO2 absorbed and desorbed, and pH values of the uncatalytic and catalytic solutions with absorption and desorption times as shown in Figure  4  result from the use of the catalyst. The uncatalytic solution and catalytic solution both absorbed 232\u00a0mmol CO2 at 130 and 120\u00a0min, respectively. However, the pH value (8.65) of the catalytic solution is lower than that (8.79) of the uncatalytic solution, which is another direct evidence of hydrolysis of \u2010COOCH3 in the IL into \u2014COOH, a key functional group in catalyzing the subsequent CO2 desorption.",
                                "The catalytic effect of [EMmim][NTf2] at different absorption and desorption times is observed through FT\u2010IR spectra, as shown in Figure\u00a0 5 . The bands at 1324 cm\u22121 (stretching of N\u2014COO\u2212), 1488 cm\u22121 (symmetric stretching of COO\u2212) and 1559 cm\u22121 (asymmetric stretching of COO\u2212) are ascribed to the MEACOO\u2212,[  15  ] while peaks at 1385 and 1635 cm\u22121 are assigned to CO3 2\u2212 and HCO3 \u2212, respectively.[  15 ,  16  ] Intensities of peaks of HCO3 \u2212 in the catalytic MEA solution during CO2 absorption (Figure\u00a05B) increase faster than those of the uncatalytic ones (Figure\u00a05A). Moreover, peak intensities of MEACOO\u2212 and CO3 2\u2212 for the catalytic MEA solutions at the end of CO2 absorption (7800 s or 130\u00a0min) are stronger than those of the uncatalytic one. Differences are more obvious for the desorption tests, as shown in Figure\u00a05C,D. Peak intensities of HCO3 \u2212 in the uncatalytic MEA solutions decrease slowly with the continuous CO2 desorption, and the intensities of CO3 2\u2212 and MEACOO\u2212 peaks and thus the concentrations of CO3 2\u2212 and MEACOO\u2212 barely change, in spite of the subsequent slightly noticeable variations. However, peak intensities of HCO3 \u2212, CO3 2\u2212and MEACOO\u2212 of the catalytic MEA solutions decrease considerably fast with time during CO2 desorption, especially in the initial 10\u00a0min. The experimental observations of the changes in concentrations of intermediates with FT\u2010IR spectra confirm the significant catalytic effect of the [EMmim][NTf2]."

The electrophilic characteristic of mim+ in [mimCH2COOH]+ can enhance the acidity of the \u2014COOH in [mimCH2COOH]+ via inductive effect, which is desired for P2\u2010R\u20101,2\u2010WHcat or formation of CO2 and H2O as well as [mimCH2COO\u2212]+. The stable intermediate ([mimCH2COO\u2212]+) resulting from the inherent resonance effect existing in \u2014COO\u2212 is a conjugate base of [mimCH2COOH]+, which can quickly react with Br\u00f8nsted acid, MEAH+ in P2\u2010R\u20101,1\u2010WHcat for realization of MEA regeneration. Furthermore, the essential part of P2\u2010R\u20101,2\u2010WHcat is to convert HCO3 \u2212 into CO2 and H2O, which is a well\u2010known rate limiting step in all the chemisorption\u2010based capture CO2 technologies. Thus, [EMmim][NTf2] with the desired Br\u00f8nsted acidity is shown to be a highly effective homogenous organocatalyst for chemisorption\u2010based capture CO2 technologies."

The catalyst can make CO2 capture much less demanding for high quality energy, and thus widely available low\u2010temperature heat (e.g., those from solar collectors or waste heat) can be effectively used for CO2 capture, which will not only leads to a significant decrease in parasitic energy penalty, capital and operating costs, but also is beneficial to the elimination of the secondary environmental pollutant resulting from MEA degradation during high\u2010temperature CO2 desorption of conventional CO2 capture technologies. Therefore, [EMmim][NTf2] is a transcendent catalyst for CO2 capture technology."

First, [EMmim][Br] was synthesized with the reaction between 1\u2010methylimidazole and methyl bromoacetate. In a typical experiment, methyl bromoacetate (0.155\u00a0mol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1\u2010methylimidazole (0.15\u00a0mol) in acetonitrile (150\u00a0mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature until it was thoroughly homogeneous, following by heating the mixture at 55 \u00b0C for 12\u00a0h. The resulting solution was evaporated under vacuum and washed with ethyl acetate repeatedly to remove excess methyl bromoacetate. [EMmim][Br] was obtained after evaporating the above solution under vacuum condition. The produced IL was dried under vacuum for at least 24\u00a0h before use (31.6\u00a0g, yield 89.6%). [EMmim][NTf2] was prepared from the metathesis reaction between [EMmim][Br] and [Li][NTf2]. In a typical procedure, [EMmim][Br] (0.06\u00a0mol) was mixed with equimolar amount of [Li][NTf2] in 20\u00a0mL water. Then the mixture was vigorously stirred for 4\u00a0h at room temperature. After that, the bottom phase was washed with deionized water repeatedly to remove the excess salt. The resulting solution was rotary evaporated under vacuum to obtain the final product [EMmim][NTf2]. The prepared IL was dried under vacuum for at least 24\u00a0h before use (23.1\u00a0g, yield 88.3%)."

The first run of CO2 absorption process was conducted at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and atmospheric pressure (0.78\u00a0bar at Laramie, Wyoming, USA, where the experiment was conducted), while the cyclic tests were conducted at 22\u00a0\u00b0C (room temperature).

The outlet gas concentration was monitored with an inline gas analyzer (NDIR ZRE, California Analytical Instruments), and then recorded using a data recording unit. Absorption time for the first run test was 7800 s and that for each cyclic test was 1800 s. Upon the completion of the CO2 absorption experiment, the temperatures of the uncatalytic and catalytic MEA solutions were gradually heated to 85 \u00b0C. During the desorption process, N2 with a flow rate of 500\u00a0mL min\u22121 was used as the carrier gas. Desorption times were 1800 s for both first\u2010run and cyclic tests. The uncatalytic and catalytic solutions for Fourier\u2010transform infrared (FT\u2010IR) spectroscopy characterizations were collected under similar conditions except for different absorption or desorption times."
