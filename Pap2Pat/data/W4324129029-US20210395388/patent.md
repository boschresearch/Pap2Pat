# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER, erbB) family includes EGFR (HER1), HER2 (erbB2), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4) and the activity of this receptor family regulates the development and maintenance of normal tissue. Overexpression of and/or aberrant regulation of the activity of this receptor family have been implicated in the development and growth of human tumor cells. Members of this family have become targets for the development of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of cancers. For example, trastuzumab (Herceptin™) and pertuzumab (Perjeta™) are anti-HER2 antibodies that have been developed for the treatment of breast cancers expressing high levels of HER2 (HER2 3+), as measured by the Herceptest™, while T-DM1 (Kadcyla™), a maytansine conjugate of trastuzumab, has also been developed for the treatment of these types of breast cancers.

Therapeutic antibodies targeting HER2 are disclosed in WO 2012/143523 to GenMab and WO 2009/154651 to Genentech. Antibodies are also described in WO 2009/068625 and WO 2009/068631.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Described herein are antigen-binding constructs comprising at least one modified antigen-binding polypeptide construct that binds to ECD2 of HER2 (HER2 ECD2) with increased affinity compared to a parent 2C4 antibody. Such modified antigen-binding polypeptide constructs comprise one or more amino acid modifications in the framework region and/or CDRs compared to the amino acid sequence of a parent 2C4 antibody that increase affinity of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct for ECD2 by 2-fold or greater, and are referred to herein as modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs. A 2C4 antibody is an antibody that binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 (HER2 2C4 epitope) and includes, for example, the mouse monoclonal antibody 2C4, as well as humanized versions of this antibody such as pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises a heavy chain variable (VH) domain of a 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 and comprises a light chain variable (VL) domain sequence and a heavy chain variable (VH) domain sequence, both derived from a 2C4 antibody.

The antigen-binding constructs can be prepared in several formats including, but not limited to the following exemplary formats: (i) a monospecific monovalent format (or one-armed (OA) format) in which the antigen-binding construct comprises a single modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct; (ii) a monospecific bivalent format (or full-sized antibody (FSA) format) in which the antigen-binding construct comprises two modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs, or (iii) a bispecific format comprising one modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct, and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct which binds to a second antigen. In one embodiment, the bispecific format may be a biparatopic format in which, for example, the antigen-binding construct comprises a first modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct that binds to ECD4 (extracellular domain 4) of HER2.

In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs, in monospecific bivalent format (FSAs), can inhibit the growth of HER2-expressing breast cancer cells and gastric cancer cells. Antigen-binding constructs in biparatopic format are internalized in HER2-expressing cells. Thus, the antigen-binding constructs described herein can be used in the treatment of cancers expressing HER2.

### Antigen-Binding Constructs

Provided herein are antigen-binding constructs, e.g. antibodies, that bind HER2 ECD2. The antigen-binding constructs comprise at least one modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprising one or more amino acid modifications compared to a parent 2C4 antibody that increase the affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct for HER2 ECD2 by 2-fold or greater, compared to a parent 2C4 antibody. In some embodiments, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises one or more amino acid modifications in the CDRs or in the framework region of the 2C4 antibody, or combinations thereof, and binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 with an affinity that is at least 2-fold higher than that of the parent 2C4 antibody.

The term “antigen-binding construct” refers to an agent, e.g., polypeptide or polypeptide complex capable of binding to an antigen or to an epitope on an antigen. In some aspects an antigen-binding construct specifically binds to an antigen of interest. In some embodiments, the antigen-binding construct specifically binds to a particular epitope on the antigen of interest. An antigen-binding construct can be a monomer, dimer, multimer, a protein, a peptide, or a protein or peptide complex; an antibody, an antibody fragment, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof; an scFv and the like. An antigen-binding construct can be monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific. In some aspects, an antigen-binding construct can include one or more antigen-binding polypeptide constructs. In some aspects the antigen-binding construct can include one or more antigen-binding polypeptide constructs linked to one or more Fc. In other aspects, the antigen-binding construct can include two antigen-binding polypeptide constructs linked to each other by linker polypeptides. Further examples of antigen-binding constructs are described below and provided in the Examples.

An antigen-binding construct can be an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof. As used herein, an “antibody” or “immunoglobulin” refers to a polypeptide substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or immunoglobulin genes, or fragments thereof, which specifically bind and recognize an analyte (e.g., antigen). The immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. The “isotype” of an antibody or immunoglobulin refers to the type of constant domain or constant region possessed by its heavy chain. There are five major antibody isotypes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subtypes, e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively.

An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is composed of two pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kD) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminal domain of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) domain and variable heavy chain (VH) domain refer to these light and heavy chain regions respectively. The IgG1 heavy chain comprises the VH, CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains respectively from the N to C-terminus. The light chain comprises the VL and CL domains from N to C terminus. The IgG1 heavy chain comprises a hinge region between the CH1 and CH2 domains.

The term “hypervariable region” or “HVR”, as used herein, refers to each of the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops (“hypervariable loops”). Generally, native four-chain antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH domain (H1, H2, H3), and three in the VL domain (L1, L2, L3). HVRs generally comprise amino acid residues from the hypervariable loops and/or from the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the latter being of highest sequence variability and/or involved in antigen recognition. With the exception of CDR1 in VH domain, CDRs generally comprise the amino acid residues that form the hypervariable loops. Hypervariable regions (HVRs) are also referred to as “complementarity determining regions” (CDRs), and these terms are used herein interchangeably in reference to portions of the variable region that form the antigen-binding regions. This particular region has been described by Kabat et al., U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1983) and by Chothia et al., J Mol Biol 196:901-917 (1987), where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. Additional methods of identifying CDRs are known including IMGT (Lefranc, M.-P., et al., IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® Nucl. Acids Res, 37, D1006-D1012 (2009), and Lefranc, M.-P., IMGT, the International ImMunoGeneTics Information System, Cold Spring Harb Protoc. 2011 Jun. 1; 2011(6)), Aho (Honegger, A et al. (2001) J. Mol Biol. 309:657-670), AbM (Martin et al. (1989) PNAS 86:9268-9272; Martin et al. (1991) Methods Enzymol. 203: 121-153; Pedersen et al. (1992) Immunomethods 1: 126; and Rees et al. (1996) in Sternberg (ed), Protein Structure Prediction, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 141-172), and contact. The latter two methods are known in the art and described at the website maintained by Andrew C. R. Martin's Bioinformatics Group at University College London (www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/). Application of any of these definitions to refer to a CDR of an antibody or variants thereof is intended to be within the scope of the term as defined and used herein. The exact residue numbers which encompass a particular CDR will vary depending on the sequence and size of the CDR. Those skilled in the art can routinely determine which residues comprise a particular CDR given the variable region amino acid sequence of the antibody. As an example, FIG. 14 provides the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL domains of pertuzumab, showing the CDR sequences as defined by the numbering systems identified above.

The six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) can contribute in varying degrees to the affinity of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct for the antigen. The antigen-binding constructs described herein can include functional antigen-binding polypeptide constructs with antigen binding sites comprised of fewer CDRs (i.e., where binding specificity is determined by one, two, three, four or five CDRs). For example, less than a complete set of 6 CDRs may be sufficient for binding.

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding construct is monospecific. A monospecific antigen-binding construct refers to an antigen-binding construct that can bind to only one antigen or epitope. A monospecific antigen-binding construct can be monovalent, i.e. having only one antigen-binding polypeptide construct that is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. One example of a monovalent monospecific antigen-binding construct is a one-armed (OA) antibody, having only a first antigen-binding polypeptide construct that is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. Alternatively, the monospecific antigen-binding construct can be bivalent, having two antigen-binding polypeptide constructs that are modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs. One example of this type of antigen-binding construct is a full-sized antibody (FSA), where both antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are linked to an Fc. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct is a monospecific monovalent antigen-binding construct comprising a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. In another embodiment, the antigen-binding construct is a monospecific bivalent antigen-binding construct comprising two antigen-binding polypeptide constructs that are modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct is a monospecific bivalent antigen-binding construct comprising two antigen-binding polypeptide constructs, both of which are modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs, where the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are different from each other. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct is a monospecific bivalent antigen-binding construct in which one antigen-binding polypeptide construct is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct and the other is an antigen-binding polypeptide construct corresponding to a parent 2C4 antibody.

A bispecific antigen-binding construct has two antigen binding polypeptide constructs, each with a unique binding specificity. Thus, a bispecific antigen-binding construct comprises one antigen binding polypeptide construct that binds to an epitope on a first antigen, and a second antigen binding polypeptide construct that binds to an epitope on a second antigen. In one embodiment, the first antigen and the second antigen are on the same protein. In another embodiment, the first antigen and the second antigen are on different proteins. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct is a bispecific antigen-binding construct comprising a first antigen-binding polypeptide construct that is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct that binds to a second antigen. The second antigen can be selected from numerous antigens known in the art, including, but not limited to antigens expressed on cancer cells, antigens that are cell surface receptors such as GPCRs, and/or immune receptors.

In some embodiments, antigen-binding constructs include a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct binding a second antigen. In some embodiments, the second antigen is the HER2 ECD4. In some embodiments, the second antigen is HER2 ECD2.

The term “biparatopic antigen-binding construct” as used herein, refers to a bispecific antigen-binding polypeptide construct where the first antigen-binding polypeptide construct and the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct bind to different epitopes on the same protein. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct comprises a first antigen-binding polypeptide that is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct that binds to a different epitope on HER2. In one embodiment, the different epitope on HER2 is selected from those found on ECD1, ECD3, or ECD4 of HER2. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct comprises a first antigen-binding polypeptide that is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct that binds to the 4D5 epitope on ECD4 of HER2. As described in more detail below, the antigen-binding polypeptide constructs can be, but are not limited to, formats such as Fab (fragment antigen-binding), scFv (single chain Fv), camelid antibodies, and sdab (single domain antibody). In some embodiments, the antigen-binding construct comprises a scaffold, e.g, an Fc.

In one embodiment, the biparatopic antigen-binding construct can bind to two different molecules and/or to the same molecule. For example, a single biparatopic antigen-binding construct that binds to the 2C4 epitope and the 4D5 epitope of HER2 can bind to the same HER2 molecule, and/or it can bind to two different HER2 molecules, potentially cross-linking two different HER2 molecules. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct comprises a first antigen-binding polypeptide construct that is a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct that binds to an epitope on HER2 ECD2 that is not the HER2 2C4 epitope.

**Antigen-Binding Polypeptide Constructs**

The antigen-binding constructs described herein comprise at least one modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are derived from a parent 2C4 antibody, have one or more amino acid modifications in the CDRs and/or framework region compared to the parent 2C4 antibody, and bind to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 with an affinity that is 2-fold or greater than that of the parent 2C4 antibody. Parent 2C4 antibodies bind to HER2 ECD2 and suitable parent 2C4 antibodies that can be engineered to prepare modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are described in more detail following.

The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs may comprise a VH domain, a VL domain and/or one or more CDRs from a parent 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs comprise a VH domain and/or VL domain derived from a parent 2C4 antibody. As is known in the art, it is sometime possible to combine the heavy chain of a first antibody that binds to a first antigen, with the light chain of a second antibody that binds to a second antigen, where the resulting Fab region maintains the ability to bind to one of the antigens. This type of situation arises when using a common light chain approach to design bispecific antibodies. Thus, in one embodiment, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises a VH domain from a parent 2C4 antibody and a VL domain from a different antibody.

Thus, in some embodiments, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises one or more CDRs from a parent 2C4 antibody. With some antibodies, the CDRs of the heavy chain are sufficient to allow binding of the antibody to the antigen. Thus, in one embodiment, the antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises the CDRs from the VH domain of the parent 2C4 antibody.

**HER2 and HER2 Epitopes**

As indicated above, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2. The expressions “ErbB2” and “HER2” are used interchangeably herein and refer to human HER2 protein described, for example, in Semba et al., PNAS (USA) 82:6497-6501 (1985) and Yamamoto et al. Nature 319:230-234 (1986) (Genebank accession number X03363). The term “erbB2” and “neu” refers to the gene encoding human ErbB2 protein. p185 or p185neu may also be used to refer to the protein product of the neu gene.

HER2 is a HER receptor. A “HER receptor” is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family and includes EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4 receptors. A HER receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain, which may bind an HER ligand; a lipophilic transmembrane domain; a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain; and a carboxyl-terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. By “HER ligand” is meant a polypeptide which binds to and/or activates an HER receptor.

The extracellular (ecto) domain of HER2 comprises four domains, Domain I (ECD1), Domain II (ECD2), Domain III (ECD3), and Domain IV (ECD4). See Garrett et al. Mol. Cell. 11: 495-505 (2003), Cho et al. Nature 421: 756-760 (2003), Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004), Tse et al. Cancer Treat Rev. 2012 Apr;38(2):133-42 (2012), or Plowman et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90:1746-1750 (1993).

The sequence of the extracellular domain of HER2 is shown below (SEQ ID NO: 980); ECD boundaries are Domain I: 1-195; Domain II: 196-320; Domain III: 321-488; Domain IV: 489-607.

The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. The “2C4 epitope” or “HER2 2C4 epitope” is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the mouse monoclonal antibody 2C4 binds. The mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,245, along with a humanized version referred to as pertuzumab. Epitope 2C4 comprises residues from domain II in the extracellular domain of HER2 (ECD2). The crystal structure of the Fab region of Pertuzumab bound to ECD2 of HER2 is known, as shown in PDB structure 1S78 and described in Franklin et al. (Cancer Cell 5:317-328). In one embodiment, the HER2 2C4 epitope is defined by the residues involved in binding to the Fab region of pertuzumab, as shown in PDB structure 1S78. In another embodiment, the HER2 2C4 epitope is defined by HER2 residues that are within 5 Angstroms of the Fab region of pertuzumab in PDB structure 1S78. As described in Franklin et al., both the mouse antibody 2C4 and pertuzumab bind to the extracellular domain of HER2.

**Parent 2C4 Antibodies**

The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs described herein are derived from a parent 2C4 antibody, comprise one or more amino acid modifications in the CDRs and/or framework region compared to a parent 2C4 antibody, and bind to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 with an affinity that is 2-fold or greater than that of the parent 2C4 antibody. A “parent 2C4 antibody” is an antibody that binds to the 2C4 epitope and is capable of being modified to include one or more amino acid modifications, as described herein, that increase the affinity of the 2C4 antibody for the HER2 2C4 epitope. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of pertuzumab. A parent 2C4 antibody can be, for example, a mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep, goat, chicken, camelid (for example, camel, llama, or alpaca), non-human primate, or human antibody that binds to HER2 ECD2. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a mouse 2C4 antibody such as the mouse monoclonal antibody 2C4 described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,245. The amino acid and DNA sequences of this antibody are known in the art. The amino acid sequence of the VH domain of mouse monoclonal antibody 2C4 is set forth in SEQ ID NO:19 and the amino acid sequence of the VL domain of this antibody is set forth in SEQ ID NO:20. Exemplary DNA sequences encoding the VH and VL domains of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody are set forth in SEQ ID NO:21 and SEQ ID NO:22, respectively. Exemplary CDRs for this mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody are shown in FIG. 13A and FIG. 13B.

Additional parent 2C4 antibodies can be identified by screening for antibodies which bind to the 2C4 epitope. In order to identify such antibodies, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 using methods known in the art and/or one can study the antibody-HER2 structure (Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004)) to identify what domain(s) of HER2 is/are bound by the antibody.

In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized version of a mouse 2C4 antibody. “Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody can comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also can comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992).

Humanized versions of the mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody are known in the art and include the humanized 2C4 antibody pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is pertuzumab. Other humanized mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,245. A hybridoma cell line expressing a humanized 2C4 (pertuzumab) was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA as ATCC HB-12697 on Apr. 8, 1999. The amino acid sequence of the VH domain of pertuzumab is set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 and the amino acid sequence of the VL domain of this antibody is set forth in SEQ ID NO:11. FIG. 13 compares the amino acid sequence of the VL domain of pertuzumab and mouse monoclonal 2C4 (FIG. 13A), and of the VH domain of pertuzumab and mouse monoclonal 2C4 (FIG. 13B), with an identification of amino acid residues according to the Kabat numbering system. Exemplary CDRs for pertuzumab are also shown in FIG. 13A, FIG. 13B and FIG. 14.

In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody other than pertuzumab. In this embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody can be generated from the mouse monoclonal antibody 2C4, for example, by a humanization method that is different from that used to generate pertuzumab. Such humanized antibodies can be designed using several methods known in the art including the one described by J C Almagro & J Fransson, in Frontiers in Bioscience, 13:1619-1633 (2008). These humanized antibodies can have the same CDRs as a mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody, with modifications described herein, but may have variation in VH and/or VL framework regions dependent upon the acceptor framework utilized in the particular humanization method.

In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody may already comprise one or more amino acid modifications that increase the affinity of the antibody for HER2 ECD2 compared to pertuzumab. Thus, in one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody may be a humanized 2C4 antibody other than pertuzumab comprising one or more amino acid modifications in the CDRs that increase affinity to HER2 ECD2, as described herein. In another embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody may be a humanized 2C4 antibody other than pertuzumab comprising one or more amino acid modifications in the framework regions that increase affinity to HER2 ECD2, as described herein. In another embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody may be a humanized 2C4 antibody other than pertuzumab comprising one or more amino acid modifications in the framework regions and the CDRs that increase affinity to HER2 ECD2, as described herein.

In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody that comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 90% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody that comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 95% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody that comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 96% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody that comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 97% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody that comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 98% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody is a humanized 2C4 antibody that comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 99% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of pertuzumab.

In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 90% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 95% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 96% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 97% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 98% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody comprises a VH domain and a VL domain with greater than 99% sequence identity with the VH domain and VL domain of mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody.

In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody can be an antibody that binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 and comprises one or more CDRs that are identical to the CDRs of pertuzumab or mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody can be an antibody that binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 and comprises one or more CDRs that have one amino acid substitution compared to the corresponding the CDRs of pertuzumab or mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody can be an antibody that binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 and comprises one or more CDRs that have two amino acid substitutions compared to the corresponding the CDRs of pertuzumab or mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody. In one embodiment, the parent 2C4 antibody can be an antibody that binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2 ECD2 and comprises one or more CDRs that have three amino acid substitutions compared to the corresponding the CDRs of pertuzumab or mouse monoclonal 2C4 antibody.

As described above, in some embodiments where the antigen-binding construct is a bispecific antigen-binding construct, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct can bind HER2 ECD4. In one embodiment, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct can bind to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 ECD4. The “epitope 4D5” is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 4D5 (ATCC CRL 10463) and Trastuzumab bind. This epitope is close to the transmembrane domain of HER2, and within Domain IV of HER2. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 4D5 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 (e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about residue 529 to about residue 625, inclusive, see FIG. 1 of US Patent Publication No. 2006/0018899).

In one embodiment, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises the VH and VL domains of mouse monoclonal 4D5 antibody as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337. In one embodiment, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises the VH and VL domains of a humanized mouse monoclonal 4D5 antibody. In one embodiment, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises the VH and VL domains of trastuzumab. Other humanized anti-HER2 ECD4 antibodies include huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 or Trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337; humanized 520C9 (WO93/21319) and humanized 2C4 antibodies as described in US Patent Publication No. 2006/0018899, all expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Additional anti-HER2 ECD4 antibodies have been described in WO 2012/143523 to GenMab and WO 2009/154651 to Genentech, both expressly incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct may comprise the VH and VL domains of these antibodies.

Amino Acid Modifications that Increase Affinity to the 2C4 Epitope of HER2 ECD2

The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs described herein comprise one or more amino acid modifications compared to a parent 2C4 antibody that increase the affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct for HER2 ECD2 by 2-fold or greater, compared to a parent 2C4 antibody. The term “amino acid modification” refers to amino acid insertions, deletions, substitutions, and rearrangements. In one embodiment, the amino acid modification is an amino acid substitution.

The one or more amino acid modifications may be in the CDR sequences of the parent 2C4 antibody, in the framework region of the parent 2C4 antibody or in both the CDR sequences and framework region of the parent 2C4 antibody. Unless otherwise indicated, the identification of framework and CDR residues is according to the Kabat numbering system (as described in Kabat and Wu, 1991; Kabat et al, Sequences of proteins of immunological interest. 5th Edition—US Department of Health and Human Services, NIH publication No. 91-3242, p 647 (1991)). FIG. 13 provides the amino acid sequence of the VH and VL domains of pertuzumab and mouse monoclonal 2C4, and the Kabat numbering of these sequences. One of skill in the art would readily be able to identify the amino acid residues corresponding to the one or more amino acid modifications discussed herein, in other 2C4 antibodies, based on Kabat numbering. Amino acid residues in the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct are noted in two ways. For example, “S74W of the VH domain” indicates that the parent amino acid residue serine at position 74 of the VH domain is substituted with tryptophan. This same substitution can also be abbreviated as “H_S74W” where “H” indicates that the amino acid modification is in the heavy chain at position 74 according to Kabat numbering.

**Affinity**

The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs described herein exhibit increased affinity for HER2 ECD2 compared to the affinity of a parent 2C4 antibody for HER2 ECD2. In some embodiments, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct binds HER2 ECD2 with an affinity that is greater than 2-fold that of the parent 2C4 antibody. In some embodiments, the increased affinity for HER2 is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 fold greater than the affinity of the parent 2C4 antibody for HER2. In some embodiments, the increased affinity for HER2 is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 fold greater than the affinity of pertuzumab for HER2. In some embodiments, affinity is determined by SPR (surface plasmon resonance) and/or FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting). In some embodiments, affinity is determined by SPR and/or FACS as described below. In some embodiments, affinity is determined by SPR at 25° C. In other embodiments, affinity is determined by SPR at 37° C.

Dissociation Constant (KD or Kd) and Maximal Binding (Bmax)

In some embodiments, the affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct is described by functional characteristics including but not limited to a dissociation constant and a maximal binding.

The term “dissociation constant (KD or Kd)” as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular ligand-protein interaction. As used herein, ligand-protein interactions refer to, but are not limited to protein-protein interactions or antibody-antigen interactions. The KD measures the propensity of two proteins complexed together (e.g. AB) to dissociate reversibly into constituent components (A+B), and is defined as the ratio of the rate of dissociation, also called the “off-rate (koff)”, to the association rate, or “on-rate (kon)”. Thus, KD equals koff/kon and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). It follows that the smaller the KD, the stronger the affinity of binding, and thus a decrease in KD indicates an increase in affinity. Therefore, a KD of 1 mM indicates weak binding affinity compared to a KD of 1 nM. Affinity is sometimes measured in terms of a KA or Ka, which is the reciprocal of the KD or Kd. KD values for antigen-binding constructs can be determined using methods well established in the art. One method for determining the KD of an antigen-binding construct is by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), typically using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is another method that can be used to measure KD.

In one embodiment, the increase in affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct for the HER2 ECD2 results from an increase in the association rate constant (ka or kon) compared to that of the parent 2C4 antibody.

In one embodiment, the increase in affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct for the HER2 ECD2 results from an decrease in the dissociation rate constant (kd or koff) compared to that of the parent 2C4 antibody.

In one embodiment, the increase in affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct for the HER2 ECD2 results from an increase in the association rate constant (ka or kon) and a decrease in the dissociation rate constant (kd or koff) compared to that of the parent 2C4 antibody.

The term “avidity” is used here to refer to the combined synergistic strength of binding affinities. Avidity can be an important structural and biological attribute of monospecific bivalent antibodies.

The binding characteristics of a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct can be determined by various techniques, one of which is the measurement of binding to target cells expressing the antigen by flow cytometry (FACS, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Typically, in such an experiment, the target cells expressing the antigen of interest are incubated with antigen-binding constructs at different concentrations, washed, incubated with a secondary agent for detecting the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct, washed, and analyzed in the flow cytometer to measure the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) representing the strength of detection signal on the cells, which in turn is related to the number of antigen-binding constructs bound to the cells. The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct concentration vs. MFI data is then fitted into a saturation binding equation to yield two key binding parameters, Bmax and B50.

Apparent KD, or apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, represents the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct concentration at which half maximal cell binding is observed. Evidently, the smaller the KD value, the smaller modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct concentration is required to reach maximum cell binding and thus the higher is the affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. The apparent KD is dependent on the conditions of the cell binding experiment, such as different receptor levels expressed on the cells and incubation conditions, and thus the apparent KD is generally different from the KD values determined from cell-free molecular experiments such as SPR and ITC.

The term “Bmax”, or maximal binding, refers to the maximum modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct binding level on the cells at saturating concentrations of modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. This parameter can be reported in the arbitrary unit MFI for relative comparison, or converted into an absolute value corresponding to the number of modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct bound to the cell with the use of a standard curve. Under appropriate conditions, a B50 (the concentration of modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct at which 50% of Bmax is achieved) can also be calculated according to methods known in the art.

**Format of Antigen-Binding Polypeptide Construct**

As indicated above, the antigen-binding constructs described herein comprise at least one modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct. The modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct can be, for example, a Fab, an scFv, or a domain antibody. In some embodiments, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct may be in the format of a VHH antibody, generated by grafting one or more CDRs comprising amino acid modifications that increase the affinity of a parent 2C4 antibody to HER2 ECD2, into a VHH framework.

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding construct may comprise multiple modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs of different formats. For example, a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct may comprise combinations such as, for example, an scFv and Fab, or an scFv and VHH, or a Fab and a VHH. Additional combinations of formats would be clear to one of skill in the art.

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding construct includes a first antigen-binding polypeptide construct (a modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct) and a second antigen-binding polypeptide construct. The format of the antigen-binding construct may be Fab-Fab, scFv-scFv, or Fab-scFv or scFv-Fab (first antigen-binding polypeptide construct-second antigen-binding polypeptide respectively). In some embodiments, the second antigen-binding polypeptide construct is a Fab, scFv, camelid antibody, domain antibody, or a peptide or polypeptide that binds to the second antigen.

A Fab (also referred to as fragment antigen-binding) contains the constant domain (CL) of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain along with the variable domains VL and VH on the light and heavy chains respectively. The variable domains comprise the complementarity determining loops (CDR, also referred to as hypervariable region) that are involved in antigen-binding. Fab′ fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region.

A “single-chain Fv” or “scFv” includes the VH and VL domains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. In one embodiment, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen-binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). HER2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO93/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458.

A “single domain antibody” or “sdAb” format is an individual immunoglobulin domain and is also known as a camelid or VHH format. SdAbs are fairly stable and easy to express as fusion partner with the Fc chain of an antibody (Harmsen M M, De Haard H J (2007). “Properties, production, and applications of camelid single-domain antibody fragments”. Appl. Microbiol Biotechnol. 77(1): 13-22).

A “domain antibody” or “dAb” format corresponds to either the VH domain or VL domain of a human antibody.

A peptide or polypeptide that binds to the second antigen can be a fibronectin, an affibody, anticalin, cysteine knot protein, DARPin, avimer, Kunitz domain or variant or derivative thereof.

The antigen binding polypeptide constructs described herein can be converted to different formats. For example, a Fab can be converted to an scFv or an scFv can be converted to a Fab. Methods of converting between types of antigen-binding domains are known in the art (see for example methods for converting an scFv to a Fab format described at, e.g., Zhou et al (2012) Mol Cancer Ther 11:1167-1476. The methods described therein are incorporated by reference.).

In one embodiment, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide constructs described herein specifically bind HER2 ECD2. “Specifically binds”, “specific binding” or “selective binding” means that the binding is selective for the antigen and can be discriminated from unwanted or non-specific interactions. The ability of an antigen-binding construct to bind to a specific antigenic determinant can be measured either through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other techniques familiar to one of skill in the art, e.g. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique (analyzed on a BIAcore instrument) (Liljeblad et al, Glyco J 17, 323-329 (2000)), and traditional binding assays (Heeley, Endocr Res 28, 217-229 (2002)).

In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an antigen-binding polypeptide construct to an unrelated protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct to the antigen as measured, e.g., by SPR.

**Additional Amino Acid Modifications**

In one embodiment, the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct comprises one or more amino acid modifications that do not change the affinity of the modified 2C4 antigen-binding polypeptide construct, but may provide some increase in thermal stability. Such amino acid modifications are selected from H_A49G and/or H_L69F.

**Scaffolds**

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs described herein comprise a scaffold. A scaffold may be a peptide, polypeptide, polymer, nanoparticle or other chemical entity. In embodiments where the scaffold is an Fc or dimeric Fc, the antigen-binding polypeptide construct(s) of the antigen-binding construct may be linked to either the N- or C-terminus of the scaffold. A dimeric Fc can be homodimeric or heterodimeric.

In embodiments where the scaffold is a peptide or polypeptide, the antigen-binding construct may be linked to the scaffold by genetic fusion with or without polypeptide linkers. In other embodiments, where the scaffold is a polymer or nanoparticle, the antigen-binding construct may be linked to the scaffold by chemical conjugation. In some embodiments, the scaffold is an albumin polypeptide or split albumin polypeptide.

The term “Fc domain” or “Fc region” herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that contains at least a portion of the constant region. The term includes native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Unless otherwise specified herein, numbering of amino acid residues in the Fc region or constant region is according to the EU numbering system, also called the EU index, as described in Kabat et al, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1991. An “Fc polypeptide” of a dimeric Fc as used herein refers to one of the two polypeptides forming the dimeric Fc domain, i.e. a polypeptide comprising C-terminal constant regions of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, capable of stable self-association. For example, an Fc polypeptide of a dimeric IgG Fc comprises an IgG CH2 and an IgG CH3 constant domain sequence.

An Fc domain comprises either a CH3 domain or a CH3 and a CH2 domain. The CH3 domain comprises two CH3 sequences, one from each of the two Fc polypeptides of the dimeric Fc. The CH2 domain comprises two CH2 sequences, one from each of the two Fc polypeptides of the dimeric Fc.

In some aspects, the Fc comprises at least one or two CH3 sequences. In some aspects, the Fc is coupled, with or without one or more linkers, to a first antigen-binding construct and/or a second antigen-binding construct. In some aspects, the Fc is a mouse Fc, rat Fc, rabbit Fc, sheep Fc, goat Fc, chicken Fc, camelid, or non-human primate Fc. In some aspects, the Fc is a human Fc. In some aspects, the Fc is a human IgG or IgG1 Fc. In some aspects, the Fc is a heterodimeric Fc. In some aspects, the Fc comprises at least one or two CH2 sequences.

In some aspects, the Fc comprises one or more modifications in at least one of the CH3 sequences. In some aspects, the Fc comprises one or more modifications in at least one of the CH2 sequences. In some aspects, an Fc is a single polypeptide. In some aspects, an Fc is multiple peptides, e.g., two polypeptides.

In some aspects, an Fc is an Fc described in patent applications PCT/CA2011/001238, filed Nov. 4, 2011 or PCT/CA2012/050780, filed Nov. 2, 2012, the entire disclosure of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Modified CH3 Domains

In some aspects, the antigen-binding construct described herein comprises a heterodimeric Fc comprising a modified CH3 domain that has been asymmetrically modified. The heterodimeric Fc can comprise two heavy chain constant domain polypeptides: a first Fc polypeptide and a second Fc polypeptide, which can be used interchangeably provided that Fc comprises one first Fc polypeptide and one second Fc polypeptide. Generally, the first Fc polypeptide comprises a first CH3 sequence and the second Fc polypeptide comprises a second CH3 sequence.

Two CH3 sequences comprising one or more amino acid modifications that promote preferential pairing, introduced in an asymmetric fashion generally results in a heterodimeric Fc, rather than a homodimer, when the two CH3 sequences dimerize. As used herein, “asymmetric amino acid modifications” refers to any modification where an amino acid at a specific position on a first CH3 sequence is different from the amino acid on a second CH3 sequence at the same position, and the first and second CH3 sequence preferentially pair to form a heterodimer, rather than a homodimer. This heterodimerization can be a result of modification of only one of the two amino acids at the same respective amino acid position on each sequence; or modification of both amino acids on each sequence at the same respective position on each of the first and second CH3 sequences. The first and second CH3 sequence of a heterodimeric Fc can comprise one or more than one asymmetric amino acid modification.

Table B provides the amino acid sequence of the human IgG1 Fc sequence, corresponding to amino acids 231 to 447 of the full-length human IgG1 heavy chain. The CH3 sequence comprises amino acid 341-447 of the full-length human IgG1 heavy chain.

Typically an Fc can include two contiguous heavy chain sequences (A and B) that are capable of dimerizing. In some aspects, one or both sequences of an Fc include one or more mutations or modifications at the following locations: L351, F405, Y407, T366, K392, T394, T350, S400, and/or N390, using EU numbering. In some aspects, an Fc includes at least one of the mutations shown in Table B. In some aspects, an Fc includes the mutations of Variant 1 A-B. In some aspects, an Fc includes the mutations of Variant 2 A-B. In some aspects, an Fc includes the mutations of Variant 3 A-B. In some aspects, an Fc includes the mutations of Variant 4 A-B. In some aspects, an Fc includes the mutations of Variant 5 A-B.

In another embodiment, a heterodimeric Fc comprises a modified CH3 domain with a first CH3 sequence having amino acid modifications at positions L351, F405 and Y407, and a second CH3 sequence having amino acid modifications at position T366, K392, and T394, one of the first or second CH3 sequences further comprising amino acid modifications at position Q347, and the other CH3 sequence further comprising amino acid modification at position K360, and one or both of said CH3 sequences further comprise the amino acid modification T350V.

In one embodiment, a heterodimeric Fc comprises a modified CH3 domain with a first CH3 sequence having amino acid modifications at positions L351, F405 and Y407, and a second CH3 sequence having amino acid modifications at positions T366, K392, and T394 and one of said first and second CH3 sequences further comprising amino acid modification of D399R or D399K and the other CH3 sequence comprising one or more of T411E, T411D, K409E, K409D, K392E and K392D. In another embodiment, a heterodimeric Fc comprises a modified CH3 domain with a first CH3 sequence having amino acid modifications at positions L351, F405 and Y407, and a second CH3 sequence having amino acid modifications at positions T366, K392, and T394, one of said first and second CH3 sequences further comprises amino acid modification of D399R or D399K and the other CH3 sequence comprising one or more of T411E, T411D, K409E, K409D, K392E and K392D, and one or both of said CH3 sequences further comprise the amino acid modification T350V.

In one embodiment, a heterodimeric Fc comprises a modified CH3 domain comprising the following amino acid modifications, where “A” represents the amino acid modifications to the first CH3 sequence, and “B” represents the amino acid modifications to the second CH3 sequence: A:L351Y_F405A_Y407V, B:T366L_K392M_T394W, A:L351Y_F405A_Y407V, B:T366L_K392L_T394W, A:T350V_L351Y_F405A_Y407V, B:T350V_T366L_K392L_T394W, A:T350V_L351Y_F405A_Y407V, B:T350V_T366L_K392M_T394W, A:T350V_L351Y_S400E_F405A_Y407V, and/or B:T350V_T366L_N390R_K392M_T394W.

The one or more asymmetric amino acid modifications can promote the formation of a heterodimeric Fc in which the heterodimeric CH3 domain has a stability that is comparable to a wild-type homodimeric CH3 domain. In an embodiment, the one or more asymmetric amino acid modifications promote the formation of a heterodimeric Fc domain in which the heterodimeric Fc domain has a stability that is comparable to a wild-type homodimeric Fc domain. In an embodiment, the one or more asymmetric amino acid modifications promote the formation of a heterodimeric Fc domain in which the heterodimeric Fc domain has a stability observed via the melting temperature (Tm) in a differential scanning calorimetry study, and where the melting temperature is within 4° C. of that observed for the corresponding symmetric wild-type homodimeric Fc domain. In some aspects, the Fc comprises one or more modifications in at least one of the CH3 sequences that promote the formation of a heterodimeric Fc with stability comparable to a wild-type homodimeric Fc.

In one embodiment, the stability of the CH3 domain can be assessed by measuring the melting temperature of the CH3 domain, for example by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thus, in a further embodiment, the CH3 domain has a melting temperature of about 68° C. or higher. In another embodiment, the CH3 domain has a melting temperature of about 70° C. or higher. In another embodiment, the CH3 domain has a melting temperature of about 72° C. or higher. In another embodiment, the CH3 domain has a melting temperature of about 73° C. or higher. In another embodiment, the CH3 domain has a melting temperature of about 75° C. or higher. In another embodiment, the CH3 domain has a melting temperature of about 78° C. or higher. In some aspects, the dimerized CH3 sequences have a melting temperature (Tm) of about 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 77.5, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, or 85° C. or higher.

In another embodiment, the heterodimeric Fc is formed with a purity greater than about 97%. In some aspects, the Fc is a heterodimer formed with a purity greater than about 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% when expressed. In some aspects, the Fc is a heterodimer formed with a purity greater than about 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% when expressed via a single cell.

Additional methods for modifying monomeric Fc polypeptides to promote heterodimeric Fc formation are described in International Patent Publication No. WO 96/027011 (knobs into holes), in Gunasekaran et al. (Gunasekaran K. et al. (2010) J Biol Chem. 285, 19637-46, electrostatic design to achieve selective heterodimerization), in Davis et al. (Davis, J H. et al.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013 Mar 26; 110(13):5145-50, and in Leaver-Fay et al. (negative state repertoires).

CH2 Domains

In some embodiments, the Fc of the antigen-binding construct comprises a CH2 domain. One example of an CH2 domain of an Fc is amino acid 231-340 of the sequence shown in Table B. Several effector functions are mediated by Fc receptors (FcRs), which bind to the Fc of an antibody.

The terms “Fc receptor” and “FcR” are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. For example, an FcR can be a native sequence human FcR. Generally, an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcγRII receptors include FcγRIIA (an “activating receptor”) and FcγRIIB (an “inhibiting receptor”), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Immunoglobulins of other isotypes can also be bound by certain FcRs (see, e.g., Janeway et al., Immuno Biology: the immune system in health and disease, (Elsevier Science Ltd., NY) (4th ed., 1999)). Activating receptor FcγRIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor FcγRIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain (reviewed in Daëron, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., Immunomethods 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term “FcR” herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976); and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)).

Modifications in the CH2 domain can affect the binding of FcRs to the Fc. A number of amino acid modifications in the Fc region are known in the art for selectively altering the affinity of the Fc for different Fcgamma receptors. In some aspects, the Fc comprises one or more modifications to promote selective binding of Fc-gamma receptors.

Exemplary mutations that alter the binding of FcRs to the Fc are listed below:

Therapeutic Antibody Engineering (by William R. Strohl and Lila M. Strohl, Woodhead Publishing series in Biomedicine No 11, ISBN 1 907568 37 9, Oct 2012) lists mutations on page 283.

In some embodiments the antigen-binding construct described herein comprises an antigen-binding polypeptide construct which binds an antigen; and a dimeric Fc that has superior biophysical properties like stability and ease of manufacture relative to an antigen-binding construct which does not include the same dimeric Fc. In some embodiments a CH2 domain comprises one or more asymmetric amino acid modifications. Exemplary asymmetric mutations are described in International Patent Application No. PCT/CA2014/050507.

Additional Modifications to Improve Effector Function.

In some embodiments an antigen-binding construct described herein includes modifications to improve its ability to mediate effector function. Such modifications are known in the art and include afucosylation, or engineering of the affinity of the Fc towards an activating receptor, mainly FCγRIIIA for ADCC, and towards C1q for CDC. The following Table C summarizes various designs reported in the literature for effector function engineering.

Methods of producing antigen-binding constructs with little or no fucose on the Fc glycosylation site (Asn 297 EU numbering) without altering the amino acid sequence are well known in the art. The GlymaX® technology (ProBioGen AG) is based on the introduction of a gene for an enzyme which deflects the cellular pathway of fucose biosynthesis into cells used for antigen-binding construct production. This prevents the addition of the sugar “fucose” to the N-linked antibody carbohydrate part by antigen-binding construct-producing cells. (von Horsten et al. (2010) Glycobiology. 2010 Dec; 20 (12):1607-18. Another approach to obtaining antigen-binding constructs with lowered levels of fucosylation can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,409,572, which teaches selecting cell lines for antigen-binding construct production for their ability to yield lower levels of fucosylation on antigen-binding constructs Antigen-binding constructs can be fully afucosylated (meaning they contain no detectable fucose) or they can be partially afucosylated, meaning that the isolated antibody contains less than 95%, less than 85%, less than 75%, less than 65%, less than 55%, less than 45%, less than 35%, less than 25%, less than 15% or less than 5% of the amount of fucose normally detected for a similar antibody produced by a mammalian expression system.

Thus, in one embodiment, a construct described herein can include a dimeric Fc that comprises one or more amino acid modifications as noted in Table C that confer improved effector function. In another embodiment, the construct can be afucosylated to improve effector function.

Fc modifications reducing FcγR and/or complement binding and/or effector function are known in the art. Recent publications describe strategies that have been used to engineer antibodies with reduced or silenced effector activity (see Strohl, W R (2009), Curr Opin Biotech 20:685-691, and Strohl, W R and Strohl L M, “Antibody Fc engineering for optimal antibody performance” In Therapeutic Antibody Engineering, Cambridge: Woodhead Publishing (2012), pp 225-249). These strategies include reduction of effector function through modification of glycosylation, use of IgG2/IgG4 scaffolds, or the introduction of mutations in the hinge or CH2 regions of the Fc. For example, US Patent Publication No. 2011/0212087 (Strohl), International Patent Publication No. WO 2006/105338 (Xencor), US Patent Publication No. 2012/0225058 (Xencor), US Patent Publication No. 2012/0251531 (Genentech), and Strop et al ((2012) J. Mol. Biol. 420: 204-219) describe specific modifications to reduce FcγR or complement binding to the Fc.

Specific, non-limiting examples of known amino acid modifications to reduce FcγR or complement binding to the Fc include those identified in the following table:

In one embodiment, the Fc comprises at least one amino acid modification identified in the above table. In another embodiment the Fc comprises amino acid modification of at least one of L234, L235, or D265. In another embodiment, the Fc comprises amino acid modification at L234, L235 and D265. In another embodiment, the Fc comprises the amino acid modification L234A, L235A and D265S.

**Linkers and Linker Polypeptides**

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs described herein include two antigen-binding polypeptide constructs. In some embodiments, the antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are each operatively linked to a linker polypeptide. In some embodiments, the antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are each operatively linked to a linker polypeptide wherein the linker polypeptides are capable of forming a complex or interface with each other. In some embodiments, the linker polypeptides are capable of forming a covalent linkage with each other. The spatial conformation of the antigen-binding construct comprising a first and second antigen-binding polypeptide constructs with the linker polypeptides is similar to the relative spatial conformation of the paratopes of a F(ab′)2 fragment generated by papain digestion, albeit in the context of an antigen-binding construct with two antigen-binding polypeptide constructs.

In one embodiment, the linker polypeptides are selected from IgA, IgE, IgD, or IgM hinge regions. In one embodiment, the linker polypeptides are selected from IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 hinge regions.

In some embodiments, the linker polypeptides are selected such that they maintain the relative spatial conformation of the paratopes of a F(ab′) fragment, and are capable of forming a covalent bond equivalent to the disulphide bond in the core hinge of IgG. Suitable linker polypeptides include IgG hinge regions such as, for example those from IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4. Modified versions of these exemplary linkers can also be used. For example, modifications to improve the stability of the IgG4 hinge are known in the art (see for example, Labrijn et al. (2009) Nature Biotechnology 27, 767-771).

In one embodiment, the linker polypeptides are operatively linked to a scaffold as described here, for example an Fc. In some aspects, an Fc is coupled to the one or more antigen-binding polypeptide constructs with one or more linkers. In some aspects where the antigen-binding construct comprises an heavy chain fragment, the Fc is coupled to the heavy chain fragment of each antigen-binding polypeptide by a linker. In some aspects where the antigen-binding construct comprises light chain, the Fc is coupled to the light chain of each antigen-binding polypeptide by a linker.

In other embodiments, the linker polypeptides are operatively linked to scaffolds other than an Fc. A number of alternate protein or molecular domains are known in the art and can be used to form selective pairs of two different antigen-binding polypeptides. One example is the leucine zipper domains of proteins such as Fos and Jun that selectively pair together [S A Kostelny, M S Cole, and J Y Tso. Formation of a bispecific antibody by the use of leucine zippers. J Immunol 1992 148:1547-53; Bernd J. Wranik, Erin L. Christensen, Gabriele Schaefer, Janet K. Jackman, Andrew C. Vendel, and Dan Eaton. LUZ-Y, a Novel Platform for the Mammalian Cell Production of Full-length IgG-bispecific Antibodies J. Biol. Chem. 2012 287: 43331-43339]. Alternately, other selectively pairing molecular pairs such as the barnase barstar pair [Deyev, S. M., Waibel, R., Lebedenko, E. N., Schubiger, A. P., and Plückthun, A. (2003). Design of multivalent complexes using the barnase*barstar module. Nat Biotechnol 21, 1486-1492], DNA strand pairs [Zahida N. Chaudri, Michael Bartlet-Jones, George Panayotou, Thomas Klonisch, Ivan M. Roitt, Torben Lund, Peter J. Delves, Dual specificity antibodies using a double-stranded oligonucleotide bridge, FEBS Letters, Volume 450, Issues 1-2, 30 Apr. 1999, Pages 23-26], split fluorescent protein pairs [Ulrich Brinkmann, Alexander Haas. Fluorescent antibody fusion protein, its production and use, WO 2011135040 A1] can also be employed. In some embodiments, the scaffold is an albumin polypeptide or split albumin polypeptide. In some embodiments, one or more antigen-binding polypeptide constructs are each operatively linked to a linker polypeptide, wherein each linker polypeptide is further linked to a scaffold.

### Testing of Antigen-Binding Constructs: HER2 Binding

The antigen-binding constructs or pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be tested in vitro, and/or in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of an antigen-binding construct or pharmaceutical composition include, the effect of an antigen-binding construct on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the antigen-binding construct or composition on the cell line and/or tissue sample can be determined by numerous assays including, but not limited to, those that assess effects on growth of cells, the ability of the antigen-binding constructs to bind to an antigen or to an antigen expressed on cells, the ability of the antigen-binding constructs to be internalized by a cell, or the thermal stability of the antigen-binding construct. In vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific antigen-binding construct is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays, or in vitro assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered antigen-binding construct, and the effect of such antigen-binding construct upon the tissue sample is observed.

Candidate antigen-binding constructs can be assayed using cells, e.g., breast cancer cell lines or cells derived from other types of cancers, expressing HER2. The following Table E describes the expression level of HER2 in several representative cancer cell lines.

The receptor numbers noted in Table E are estimates and can vary depending on the experimental conditions used to assess receptor level.

As is known in the art, a number of assays may be employed in order to identify antigen-binding constructs suitable for use in the methods described herein. These assays can be carried out in cancer cells expressing HER2. Examples of suitable cancer cells are identified in Table E. Examples of assays that may be carried out are described as follows.

To determine the ability of candidate antigen-binding constructs to inhibit the growth of HER2-expressing cells one may measure the effect of the candidate antigen-binding construct on the viability, cytotoxicity, or proliferation of such cells. Assays for measuring these functions are well known in the art. For example, cell viability may be measured by LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assay, MTT assay, Neutral Red assay, or resazurin assay. Kits for performing these assays are commercially available from suppliers such as Sigma, Promega, and R&D Systems. In one embodiment, the candidate antigen-binding construct of choice is able to inhibit growth of cancer cells in cell culture by about 20-100% and preferably by about 50-100% at compared to a control antigen-binding construct.

To select for candidate antigen-binding constructs which induce cell death, loss of membrane integrity as indicated by, e.g., PI (phosphatidylinositol), trypan blue or 7AAD uptake may be assessed relative to control. These assays are well known in the art and kits for performing these assays are commercially available from suppliers such as Sigma, Promega, and R&D Systems.

In order to select for candidate antigen-binding constructs which induce apoptosis, an annexin binding assay may be employed. In addition to the annexin binding assay, a DNA staining assay, or caspase activity assay may also be used. These assays are also well known in the art. Kits for performing these assays are commercially available from suppliers such as Sigma, Promega, BD Biosciences, or Roche Life Science.

The ability of an antigen-binding construct to bind to a target antigen can be assessed by antigen-binding assays or cell binding assays. Antigen-binding assays are carried out by incubating the antigen-binding construct with antigen, either purified, or in a mixture and assessing the amount of antigen-binding construct bound to the antigen, compared to controls or reference antigen-binding construct. The amount of antigen-binding construct bound to the antigen can by assessed by ELISA, or SPR (surface plasmon resonance), for example. Cell binding assays are carried out by incubating the antigen-binding construct with cells that express the antigen of interest. The amount of antigen-binding construct bound to the cells can be assessed by flow cytometry, for example, and compared to binding observed in the presence of controls or reference antigen-binding construct. Methods for carrying out these types of assays are well known in the art.

To determine binding characteristics of an antigen-binding construct, such as affinity to a target antigen, binding assays as described above may be performed and the binding characteristics calculated. Details relating to the calculation of binding characteristics are described elsewhere herein and in the Examples. Additional details can be found in the Handbook of Therapeutic Antibodies, eds. Dubel, S. and Reichert J M, Chapter 6, pp 115-140, Wiley.

To screen for antigen-binding constructs which bind to an epitope on ErbB2 bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art.

Competition between antigen-binding constructs can be determined by an assay in which an antigen-binding construct under test inhibits or blocks specific binding of a reference antigen-binding construct to a common antigen (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 50:1495, 1990; Fendly et al. Cancer Research 50: 1550-1558; U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,245). A test antigen-binding construct competes with a reference antigen-binding construct if an excess of a test antigen-binding construct (e.g., at least 2×, 5×, 10×, 20×, or 100×) inhibits or blocks binding of the reference antigen-binding construct by, e.g., at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay. Antigen-binding constructs identified by competition assay (competing antigen-binding construct) include antigen-binding constructs binding to the same epitope as the reference antigen-binding construct and antigen-binding constructs binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antigen-binding construct for steric hindrance to occur. For example, a second, competing antigen-binding construct can be identified that competes for binding to HER2 with a first antigen-binding construct described herein. In certain instances, the second construct can block or inhibit binding of the first construct by, e.g., at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay. In certain instances, the second construct can displace the first construct by greater than 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%.

The ability of an antigen-binding construct to be internalized by cells may be determined by incubating the cells with the antigen-binding construct and assessing the amount of antigen-binding construct localized within the cell. Internalization assays may be direct, indirect, or measured by indirect cytotoxicity. The antigen-binding construct may be conjugated with a dye or toxin in order to facilitate its detection. Where the antigen-binding construct is conjugated to a dye, internalization may be measured by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. Where the antigen-binding construct is conjugated to a toxin, internalization may be measured by assessing the viability of cells. Kits for assessing internalization are commercially available from ThermoFisher Scientific, ATS Bio, for example.

The thermal stability of the antigen-binding constructs can be determined according to methods known in the art such as differential scanning calorimetry (Chen et al (2003) Pharm Res 20:1952-60; Ghirlando et al (1999) Immunol Lett 68:47-52), or circular dichroism (Murray et al. (2002) J. Chromatogr Sci 40:343-9).

In some embodiments, antigen-binding constructs described herein are assayed for function in vivo, e.g., in animal models. Several suitable animal models are known in the art to test the ability of candidate therapies to treat cancers, such as breast cancers or gastric cancers. In general, these models are mouse xenograft models, where cell line-derived tumors or patient-derived tumors are implanted in mice. The antigen-binding construct to be tested is generally administered after the tumor has been established in the animal, but in some cases, the antigen-binding construct can be administered with the cell line. The volume of the tumor and/or survival of the animal is monitored in order to determine if the antigen-binding construct is able to treat the tumor. In some embodiments, the animal models are those described in Table F. In some embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs display an increase in efficacy of treatment in an animal model compared to a reference antigen-binding construct.

### Reference Antigen-Binding Construct

In some embodiments, the functional characteristics of the antigen-binding constructs described herein are compared to those of a reference antigen-binding construct. The identity of the reference antigen-binding construct depends on the functional characteristic being measured or the distinction being made. For example, when comparing the functional characteristics of antigen-binding constructs described herein, the reference antigen-binding construct may be a pertuzumab (for example v6322), or analog thereof, or may be a monovalent or one-armed version of pertuzumab (v10013). Alternatively, when assessing or comparing the functional characteristics of a biparatopic anti-HER2 antigen-binding construct, the reference antigen-binding construct can be one in which the HER2 ECD4-binding arm is an scFv, and the HER2 ECD2-binding arm is a pertuzumab Fab (v7091). Additional reference antigen-binding constructs may be employed and a worker skilled in the art would readily be able to identify appropriate reference antigen-binding constructs.

### Antigen-Binding Constructs and Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC)

In certain embodiments an antigen-binding construct is conjugated to a drug, e.g., a toxin, a chemotherapeutic agent, an immune modulator, or a radioisotope. Several methods of preparing ADCs (antibody drug conjugates or antigen-binding construct drug conjugates) are known in the art and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,624,003 (pot method), U.S. Pat. No. 8,163,888 (one-step), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 (two-step method) for example.

In some embodiments, the drug is selected from a maytansine, auristatin, calicheamicin, or derivative thereof. In other embodiments, the drug is a maytansine selected from DM1 and DM4. Further examples are described below.

In some embodiments the drug is conjugated to the antigen-binding construct with an SMCC linker (DM1), or an SPDB linker (DM4). Additional examples are described below. The drug-to-antigen-binding protein ratio (DAR) can be, e.g., 1.0 to 6.0 or 3.0 to 5.0 or 3.5-4.2.

In some embodiments the antigen-binding construct is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. The term “cytotoxic agent” as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes (e.g. At211, I131, I125, Y90, Re186, Re188, Sm153, Bi212, P32, and Lu177), chemotherapeutic agents, and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof. Further examples are described below.

Drugs

Non-limiting examples of drugs or payloads used in various embodiments of ADCs include DM1 (maytansine, N2′-deacetyl-N2′-(3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)- or N2′-deacetyl-N2′-(3-mercapto-1 -oxopropyl)-maytansine), mc-MMAD (6-maleimidocaproyl-monomethylauristatin-D or N-methyl-L-valyl-N-[(1S,2R)-2-methoxy-4-[(2S)-2-[(1R,2R)-1-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxo-3-[[(1S)-2-phenyl-1-(2-thiazolyl)ethyl]amino]propyl]-1-pyrrolidinyl]-1-[(1S)-1-methylpropyl]-4-oxobutyl]-N-methyl-(9Cl)-L-valinamide), mc-MMAF (maleimidocaproyl-monomethylauristatin F or N-[6-(2,5-dihydro-2,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-oxohexyl]-N-methyl-L-valyl-L-valyl-(3R,4S,5S)-3-methoxy-5-methyl-4-(methylamino)heptanoyl-(αR,βR,2S)-β-methoxy-α-methyl-2-pyrrolidinepropanoyl-L-phenylalanine) and mc-Val-Cit-PABA-MMAE (6-maleimidocaproyl-ValcCit-(p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl)-monomethylauristatin E or N-[[[4-[[N-[6-(2,5-dihydro-2,5-dioxo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-oxohexyl]-L-valyl-N5-(aminocarbonyl)-L-ornithyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]carbonyl]-N-methyl-L-valyl-N-[(1S,2R)-4-[(2S)-2-[(1R,2R)-3-[[(1R,2S)-2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]amino]-1-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxopropyl]-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-methoxy-1-[(1S)-1-methylpropyl]-4-oxobutyl]-N-methyl-L-valinamide). DM1 is a derivative of the tubulin inhibitor maytansine while MMAD, MMAE, and MMAF are auristatin derivatives.

Other examples include the cytotoxic, anti-mitotic compounds described in WO 2014/014487 and WO 2016/041082.

Maytansinoid Drug Moieties

Many positions on maytansine compounds are known to be useful as the linkage position, depending upon the type of link. For example, for forming an ester linkage, the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C-20 position having a hydroxyl group are all suitable.

All stereoisomers of the maytansinoid drug moiety are contemplated for the ADCs described herein, i.e. any combination of R and S configurations at the chiral carbons of D.

Auristatins

In some embodiments, the drug is an auristatin, such as auristatin E (also known in the art as a derivative of dolastatin-10) or a derivative thereof. The auristatin can be, for example, an ester formed between auristatin E and a keto acid. For example, auristatin E can be reacted with paraacetyl benzoic acid or benzoylvaleric acid to produce AEB and AEVB, respectively. Other typical auristatins include AFP, MMAF, and MMAE. The synthesis and structure of exemplary auristatins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,884,869, 7,098,308, 7,256,257, 7,423,116, 7,498,298 and 7,745,394, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes.

Conjugate Linkers

In some embodiments, the drug is linked to the antigen-binding construct, e.g., antibody, by a linker. Attachment of a linker to an antibody can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as through surface lysines, reductive-coupling to oxidized carbohydrates, and through cysteine residues liberated by reducing interchain disulfide linkages. A variety of ADC linkage systems are known in the art, including hydrazone-, disulfide- and peptide-based linkages.

Suitable linkers include, for example, cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. A cleavable linker is typically susceptible to cleavage under intracellular conditions. Suitable cleavable linkers include, for example, a peptide linker cleavable by an intracellular protease, such as lysosomal protease or an endosomal protease. In exemplary embodiments, the linker can be a dipeptide linker, such as a valine-citrulline (val-cit), a phenylalanine-lysine (phe-lys) linker, or maleimidocapronic-valine-citruline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (mc-Val-Cit-PABA) linker. Another linker is Sulfosuccinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). Sulfo-SMCC conjugation occurs via a maleimide group which reacts with sulfhydryls (thiols, —SH), while its Sulfo-NHS ester is reactive toward primary amines (as found in Lysine and the protein or peptide N-terminus). Yet another linker is maleimidocaproyl (MC). Other suitable linkers include linkers hydrolyzable at a specific pH or a pH range, such as a hydrazone linker. Additional suitable cleavable linkers include disulfide linkers. In some embodiments, the linker may be a sulphonamide linkage system as described in WO 2015/095953. The linker may be covalently bound to the antibody to such an extent that the antibody must be degraded intracellularly in order for the drug to be released e.g. the MC linker and the like.

Preparation of ADCs

The ADC may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent, to form antibody-linker intermediate Ab-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety D; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of a drug moiety with a linker reagent, to form drug-linker intermediate D-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group or an electrophilic group of an antibody. Conjugation methods (1) and (2) may be employed with a variety of antibodies, drug moieties, and linkers to prepare the antibody-drug conjugates described here.

Several specific examples of methods of preparing ADCs are known in the art and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,624,003 (pot method), U.S. Pat. No. 8,163,888 (one-step), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 (two-step method).

### Methods of Preparation of Antigen-Binding Constructs

Antigen-binding constructs described herein may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567.

In one embodiment, isolated nucleic acid encoding an antigen-binding construct described herein is provided. Such nucleic acid may encode an amino acid sequence comprising the VL and/or an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antigen-binding construct (e.g., the light and/or heavy chains of the antigen-binding construct). In a further embodiment, one or more vectors (e.g., expression vectors) comprising such nucleic acid are provided. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid is provided in a multicistronic vector. In a further embodiment, a host cell comprising such nucleic acid is provided. In one such embodiment, a host cell comprises (e.g., has been transformed with): (1) a vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct and an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct, or (2) a first vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct and a second vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antigen-binding polypeptide construct. In one embodiment, the host cell is eukaryotic, e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell, or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell, or lymphoid cell (e.g., Y0, NS0, Sp20 cell). In one embodiment, a method of making an antigen-binding construct is provided, wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell comprising nucleic acid encoding the antigen-binding construct, as provided above, under conditions suitable for expression of the antigen-binding construct, and optionally recovering the antigen-binding construct from the host cell (or host cell culture medium).

For recombinant production of the antigen-binding construct, nucleic acid encoding an antigen-binding construct, e.g., as described above, is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and/or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antigen-binding construct).

The term “substantially purified” refers to a construct described herein, or variant thereof that may be substantially or essentially free of components that normally accompany or interact with the protein as found in its naturally occurring environment, i.e. a native cell, or host cell in the case of recombinantly produced heteromultimer that in certain embodiments, is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1% (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the heteromultimer or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein in certain embodiments is present at about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, about 10%, about 5%, about 4%, about 3%, about 2%, or about 1% or less of the dry weight of the cells. When the heteromultimer or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein, in certain embodiments, is present in the culture medium at about 5 g/L, about 4 g/L, about 3 g/L, about 2 g/L, about 1 g/L, about 750 mg/L, about 500 mg/L, about 250 mg/L, about 100 mg/L, about 50 mg/L, about 10 mg/L, or about 1 mg/L or less of the dry weight of the cells. In certain embodiments, “substantially purified” heteromultimer produced by the methods described herein, has a purity level of at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, specifically, a purity level of at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, and more specifically, a purity level of at least about 90%, a purity level of at least about 95%, a purity level of at least about 99% or greater as determined by appropriate methods such as SDS/PAGE analysis, RP-HPLC, SEC, and capillary electrophoresis.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antigen-binding construct-encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells described herein.

A “recombinant host cell” or “host cell” refers to a cell that includes an exogenous polynucleotide, regardless of the method used for insertion, for example, direct uptake, transduction, f-mating, or other methods known in the art to create recombinant host cells. The exogenous polynucleotide may be maintained as a nonintegrated vector, for example, a plasmid, or alternatively, may be integrated into the host genome.

As used herein, the term “eukaryote” refers to organisms belonging to the phylogenetic domain Eucarya such as animals (including but not limited to, mammals, insects, reptiles, birds, etc.), ciliates, plants (including but not limited to, monocots, dicots, algae, etc.), fungi, yeasts, flagellates, microsporidia, protists, etc.

As used herein, the term “prokaryote” refers to prokaryotic organisms. For example, a non-eukaryotic organism can belong to the Eubacteria (including but not limited to, Escherichia coli, Thermus thermophilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, etc.) phylogenetic domain, or the Archaea (including but not limited to, Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Halobacterium such as Haloferax volcanii and Halobacterium species NRC-1, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aeuropyrum pernix, etc.) phylogenetic domain.

For example, antigen-binding construct may be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antigen-binding construct fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,237, 5,789,199, and 5,840,523. (See also Charlton, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B. K. C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 2003), pp. 245-254, describing expression of antibody fragments in E. coli.) After expression, the antigen-binding construct may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified.

In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antigen-binding construct-encoding vectors, including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been “humanized,” resulting in the production of an antigen-binding construct with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See Gerngross, Nat. Biotech. 22:1409-1414 (2004), and Li et al., Nat. Biotech. 24:210-215 (2006).

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antigen-binding constructs are also derived from multicellular organisms (invertebrates and vertebrates). Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells, particularly for transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells.

Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,959,177, 6,040,498, 6,420,548, 7,125,978, and 6,417,429 (describing PLANTIBODIES™ technology for producing antigen-binding constructs in transgenic plants).

Vertebrate cells may also be used as hosts. For example, mammalian cell lines that are adapted to grow in suspension may be useful. Other examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells as described, e.g., in Graham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK); mouse sertoli cells (TM4 cells as described, e.g., in Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA); canine kidney cells (MDCK; buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A); human lung cells (W138); human liver cells (Hep G2); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562); TRI cells, as described, e.g., in Mather et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982); MRC 5 cells; and FS4 cells. Other useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, including DHFR− CHO cells (Urlaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); and myeloma cell lines such as Y0, NS0 and Sp2/0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for antigen-binding construct production, see, e.g., Yazaki and Wu, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B. K. C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.), pp. 255-268 (2003).

In one embodiment, the antigen-binding constructs described herein are produced in stable mammalian cells, by a method comprising: transfecting at least one stable mammalian cell with: nucleic acid encoding the antigen-binding construct, in a predetermined ratio; and expressing the nucleic acid in the at least one mammalian cell. In some embodiments, the predetermined ratio of nucleic acid is determined in transient transfection experiments to determine the relative ratio of input nucleic acids that results in the highest percentage of the antigen-binding construct in the expressed product.

Antigen-binding constructs produced in mammalian cells are typically glycosylated. Glycosylation can affect properties of the antigen-binding construct such as effector function and stability. In some embodiments the antigen-binding constructs are glycosylated and include fucose. In other embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs are glycosylated and do not include fucose.

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs are aglycosylated. Aglycosylation of antigen-binding constructs can be performed by methods known in the art, for example, those described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs are deglycosylated to remove sugar moieties. Methods of deglycosylating antibodies are known in the art and include treatment with PNGase F, for example. Kits for deglycosylating antibodies are commercially available.

In some embodiments is the method of producing a antigen-binding construct in stable mammalian cells as described herein wherein the expression product of the at least one stable mammalian cell comprises a larger percentage of the desired glycosylated antigen-binding construct as compared to the monomeric heavy or light chain polypeptides, or other antibodies.

In some embodiments is the method of producing a glycosylated antigen-binding construct in stable mammalian cells described herein, said method comprising identifying and purifying the desired glycosylated antigen-binding construct. In some embodiments, the said identification is by one or both of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

If required, the antigen-binding constructs can be purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, affinity, sizing or gel filtration, and reversed-phase, carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic, immunological, precipitation, dialysis, and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. As is well known in the art, a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies, and these proteins can used for purification of antigen-binding constructs. For example, the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise, the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example, antibodies may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed, Ni+2 affinity chromatography if a His-tag is employed, or immobilized anti-flag antibody if a flag-tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see, e.g. incorporated entirely by reference Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, 3rd Ed., Scopes, Springer-Verlag, NY, 1994, incorporated entirely by reference. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the use of the antigen-binding constructs. In some instances no purification is necessary.

In certain embodiments the antigen-binding constructs are purified using Anion Exchange Chromatography including, but not limited to, chromatography on Q-sepharose, DEAE sepharose, poros HQ, poros DEAF, Toyopearl Q, Toyopearl QAE, Toyopearl DEAE, Resource/Source Q and DEAE, Fractogel Q and DEAE columns.

In specific embodiments the proteins described herein are purified using Cation Exchange Chromatography including, but not limited to, SP-sepharose, CM sepharose, poros HS, poros CM, Toyopearl SP, Toyopearl CM, Resource/Source S and CM, Fractogel S and CM columns and their equivalents and comparables.

In addition, antigen-binding constructs described herein can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Creighton, 1983, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W. H. Freeman & Co., N.Y and Hunkapiller et al., Nature, 310:105-111 (1984)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4diaminobutyric acid, alpha-amino isobutyric acid, 4aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, □-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as β-methyl amino acids, Cα-methyl amino acids, Nα-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary).

Post-Translational Modifications:

In certain embodiments antigen-binding constructs described herein are differentially modified during or after translation.

The term “modified,” as used herein refers to any changes made to a given polypeptide, such as changes to the length of the polypeptide, the amino acid sequence, chemical structure, co-translational modification, or post-translational modification of a polypeptide. The form “(modified)” term means that the polypeptides being discussed are optionally modified, that is, the polypeptides under discussion can be modified or unmodified.

The term “post-translationally modified” refers to any modification of a natural or non-natural amino acid that occurs to such an amino acid after it has been incorporated into a polypeptide chain. The term encompasses, by way of example only, co-translational in vivo modifications, co-translational in vitro modifications (such as in a cell-free translation system), post-translational in vivo modifications, and post-translational in vitro modifications.

In some embodiments, the modification is at least one of: glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage and linkage to an antibody molecule or antigen-binding construct or other cellular ligand. In some embodiments, the antigen-binding construct is chemically modified by known techniques, including but not limited, to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease, NaBH4; acetylation, formylation, oxidation, reduction; and metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin.

Additional post-translational modifications of antigen-binding constructs described herein include, for example, N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-terminal or C-terminal ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The antigen-binding constructs described herein are modified with a detectable label, such as an enzymatic, fluorescent, isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein. In certain embodiments, examples of suitable enzyme labels include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin; and examples of suitable radioactive material include iodine, carbon, sulfur, tritium, indium, technetium, thallium, gallium, palladium, molybdenum, xenon, fluorine.

In specific embodiments, antigen-binding constructs described herein are attached to macrocyclic chelators that associate with radiometal ions.

In some embodiments, the antigen-binding constructs described herein are modified by either natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. In certain embodiments, the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. In certain embodiments, polypeptides from antigen-binding constructs described herein are branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and in some embodiments are cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides are a result from posttranslation natural processes or made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.

### Pharmaceutical Compositions

Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antigen-binding construct described herein. Pharmaceutical compositions comprise the construct and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. In some aspects, the carrier is a man-made carrier not found in nature. Water can be used as a carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

In certain embodiments, the composition comprising the construct is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein are formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxide isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.

### Methods of Treatment

In certain embodiments, provided is a method of treating a disease or disorder comprising administering to a subject in which such treatment, prevention or amelioration is desired, an antigen-binding construct described herein, in an amount effective to treat, prevent or ameliorate the disease or disorder.

“Disorder” refers to any condition that would benefit from treatment with an antigen-binding construct or method described herein. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. In some embodiments, the disorder is cancer, as described in more detail below.

The term “subject” refers to an animal, in some embodiments a mammal, which is the object of treatment, observation or experiment. An animal may be a human, a non-human primate, a companion animal (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animal (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) or a laboratory animal (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like).

The term “mammal” as used herein includes but is not limited to humans, non-human primates, canines, felines, murines, bovines, equines, and porcines.

“Treatment” refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishing of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antigen-binding constructs described herein are used to delay development of a disease or disorder. In one embodiment, antigen-binding constructs and methods described herein effect tumor regression. In one embodiment, antigen-binding constructs and methods described herein effect inhibition of tumor/cancer growth.

Desirable effects of treatment include, but are not limited to, one or more of preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, improved survival, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antigen-binding constructs described herein are used to delay development of a disease or to slow the progression of a disease.

The term “effective amount” as used herein refers to that amount of construct being administered, which will accomplish the goal of the recited method, e.g., relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease, condition or disorder being treated. The amount of the composition described herein which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of a therapeutic protein can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses are extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

The antigen-binding construct is administered to the subject. Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer an antigen-binding construct formulation described herein, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, in certain embodiments, it is desirable to introduce the antigen-binding construct compositions described herein into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.

In a specific embodiment, it is desirable to administer the antigen-binding constructs, or compositions described herein locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably, when administering a protein, including an antigen-binding construct, described herein, care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.

In another embodiment, the antigen-binding constructs or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.)

In yet another embodiment, the antigen-binding constructs or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); see also Levy et al., Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target, e.g., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)).

In a specific embodiment comprising a nucleic acid encoding antigen-binding constructs described herein, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see e.g., Joliot et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864-1868 (1991)), etc. Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by homologous recombination.

In certain embodiments an antigen-binding construct described herein is administered as a combination with antigen-binding constructs with non-overlapping binding target epitopes.

The amount of the antigen-binding construct which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses are extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

The antigen-binding constructs described herein may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy and anti-tumor agents). Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in an embodiment, human antigen-binding constructs, fragments derivatives, analogs, or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.

**Methods of Treating Cancers**

Described herein are methods of treating a HER2+ cancer or a tumor in a subject, and methods of inhibiting the growth of a HER2+ tumor cell or killing a HER2+ tumor cell using the antigen-binding constructs described herein.

By a HER2+ cancer is meant a cancer that expresses HER2 such that the antigen-binding constructs described herein are able to bind to the cancer. As is known in the art, HER2+ cancers express HER2 at varying levels. To determine ErbB, e.g. ErbB2 (HER2) expression in the cancer, various diagnostic/prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment, ErbB2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC, e.g. using the HERCEPTEST® (Dako). Paraffin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a ErbB2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows:

Score 0: no staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of tumor cells.

Score 1+: a faint/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10% of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.

Score 2+: a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells.

Score 3+: a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1+ scores for ErbB2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not overexpressing ErbB2, whereas those tumors with 2+ or 3+ scores may be characterized as overexpressing ErbB2.

Alternatively, or additionally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays such as the INFORM™ (sold by Ventana, Ariz.) or PATHVISION™ (Vysis, Ill.) may be carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent (if any) of ErbB2 overexpression in the tumor. In comparison with IHC assay, the FISH assay, which measures HER2 gene amplification, seems to correlate better with response of patients to treatment with HERCEPTIN®, and is currently considered to be the preferred assay to identify patients likely to benefit from HERCEPTIN® treatment.

Table E describes the expression level of HER2 on several representative breast cancer and other cancer cell lines (Subik et al. (2010) Breast Cancer: Basic Clinical Research:4; 35-41; Prang et al. (2005) British Journal of Cancer Research:92; 342-349). As shown in the table, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells are considered to be low HER2 expressing cells; JIMT-1, and ZR-75-1 cells are considered to be medium HER2 expressing cells, and SKBR3 and BT-474 cells are considered to be high HER2 expressing cells. SKOV3 (ovarian cancer) cells are considered to be medium HER2 expressing cells.

Described herein are methods of treating a subject having a HER2+ cancer or a tumor comprising providing to the subject an effective amount of an antigen-binding construct or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen-binding construct described herein.

Also described herein is the use of an HER2 antigen-binding construct described herein for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a cancer or a tumor. Also described herein are HER2 antigen-binding constructs for use in the treatment of cancer or a tumor.

In some embodiments, the subject being treated has pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, brain cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer or an epidermal-derived cancer. In some embodiments, the tumor is metastatic.

In general, the tumor in the subject being treated expresses an average of 10,000 or more copies of HER2 per tumor cell. In certain embodiments the tumor is HER2 0-1+, 1+, HER2 2+ or HER2 3+ as determined by IHC. In some embodiments the tumor is HER2 2+ or lower, or HER2 1+ or lower.

Provided herein are methods for treating a subject having a HER2+ tumor that is resistant or becomes resistant to other standard-of-care therapies comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising the antigen-binding constructs described herein. In certain embodiments the antigen-binding constructs described herein are provided to subjects that are unresponsive to current therapies, optionally in combination with one or more current anti-HER2 therapies. In some embodiments the current anti-HER2 therapies include, but are not limited to, anti-HER2 or anti-HER3 monospecific bivalent antibodies, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, a bi-specific HER2/HER3 scFv, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the cancer is resistant to various chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes. In some embodiments the cancer is resistant to trastuzumab. In some embodiment the cancer is resistant to pertuzumab. In one embodiment, the cancer is resistant or refractory to T-DM1 (trastuzumab conjugated to DM1). In some embodiments, the subject has previously been treated with an anti-HER2 antibody such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab or T-DM1. In some embodiments, the subject has not been previously treated with an anti-HER2 antibody. In one embodiment, the antigen-binding construct is provided to a subject for the treatment of metastatic cancer when the patient has progressed on previous anti-HER2 therapy.

Provided herein are methods of treating a subject having a HER2+ tumor comprising providing an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antigen-binding construct described herein in conjunction with an additional anti-tumor agent. The additional anti tumor agent may be a therapeutic antibody as noted above, or a chemotherapeutic agent. Chemotherapeutic agents useful for use in combination with the antigen-binding constructs described herein include cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, irinotecan, etoposide, vinblastine, pemetrexed, 5-fluorouracil (with or without folinic acid), capecitabine, carboplatin, epirubicin, oxaliplatin, folfirinox, abraxane, and cyclophosphamide.

The additional agents may be administered to the subject being treated concurrently with the antigen-binding constructs or sequentially.

The subject being treated with the antigen-binding constructs may be a human, a non-human primate or other mammal such as a mouse.

In some embodiments, the result of providing an effective amount of the antigen-binding construct to a subject having a tumor is shrinking the tumor, inhibiting growth of the tumor, increasing time to progression of the tumor, prolonging disease-free survival of the subject, decreasing metastases, increasing the progression-free survival of the subject, or increasing overall survival of the subject or increasing the overall survival of a group of subjects receiving the treatment.

Also described herein are methods of killing or inhibiting the growth of a HER2-expressing tumor cell comprising contacting the cell with the antigen-binding construct provided herein.

### Kits and Articles of Manufacture

Individual components of the kit would be packaged in separate containers and, associated with such containers, can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale. The kit may optionally contain instructions or directions outlining the method of use or administration regimen for the antigen-binding construct.

When one or more components of the kit are provided as solutions, for example an aqueous solution, or a sterile aqueous solution, the container means may itself be an inhalant, syringe, pipette, eye dropper, or other such like apparatus, from which the solution may be administered to a subject or applied to and mixed with the other components of the kit.

The components of the kit may also be provided in dried or lyophilized form and the kit can additionally contain a suitable solvent for reconstitution of the lyophilized components. Irrespective of the number or type of containers, the kits described herein also may comprise an instrument for assisting with the administration of the composition to a patient. Such an instrument may be an inhalant, nasal spray device, syringe, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, eye dropper or similar medically approved delivery vehicle.

In another aspect described herein, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, IV solution bags, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is by itself or combined with another composition effective for treating, preventing and/or diagnosing the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is an antigen-binding construct described herein. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. Moreover, the article of manufacture may comprise (a) a first container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises an antigen-binding construct described herein; and (b) a second container with a composition contained therein, wherein the composition comprises a further cytotoxic or otherwise therapeutic agent. The article of manufacture in this embodiment described herein may further comprise a package insert indicating that the compositions can be used to treat a particular condition. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second (or third) container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.

Polypeptides and Polynucleotides

The antigen-binding constructs described herein comprise at least one polypeptide. Also described are polynucleotides (also referred to herein as nucleic acids) encoding the polypeptides described herein. The antigen-binding constructs are typically isolated.

As used herein, “isolated” means an agent (e.g., a polypeptide or polynucleotide) that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural cell culture environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antigen-binding construct, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. Isolated also refers to an agent that has been synthetically produced, e.g., via human intervention.

The terms “polypeptide,” “peptide” and “protein” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. That is, a description directed to a polypeptide applies equally to a description of a peptide and a description of a protein, and vice versa. The terms apply to naturally occurring amino acid polymers as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is a non-naturally encoded amino acid. As used herein, the terms encompass amino acid chains of any length, including full length proteins, wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.

The term “amino acid” refers to naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally encoded amino acids are the 20 common amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, praline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and pyrrolysine and selenocysteine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, such as, homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (such as, norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Reference to an amino acid includes, for example, naturally occurring proteogenic L-amino acids; D-amino acids, chemically modified amino acids such as amino acid variants and derivatives; naturally occurring non-proteogenic amino acids such as β-alanine, ornithine, etc.; and chemically synthesized compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of amino acids. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids include, but are not limited to, α-methyl amino acids (e.g. α-methyl alanine), D-amino acids, histidine-like amino acids (e.g., 2-amino-histidine, β-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine), amino acids having an extra methylene in the side chain (“homo” amino acids), and amino acids in which a carboxylic acid functional group in the side chain is replaced with a sulfonic acid group (e.g., cysteic acid). The incorporation of non-natural amino acids, including synthetic non-native amino acids, substituted amino acids, or one or more D-amino acids into the antigen-binding constructs described herein may be advantageous in a number of different ways. D-amino acid-containing peptides, etc., exhibit increased stability in vitro or in vivo compared to L-amino acid-containing counterparts. Thus, the construction of peptides, etc., incorporating D-amino acids can be particularly useful when greater intracellular stability is desired or required. More specifically, D-peptides, etc., are resistant to endogenous peptidases and proteases, thereby providing improved bioavailability of the molecule, and prolonged lifetimes in vivo when such properties are desirable. Additionally, D-peptides, etc., cannot be processed efficiently for major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted presentation to T helper cells, and are therefore, less likely to induce humoral immune responses in the whole organism.

Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.

Also included herein are polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the antigen-binding constructs. The term “polynucleotide” or “nucleotide sequence” is intended to indicate a consecutive stretch of two or more nucleotide molecules. The nucleotide sequence may be of genomic, cDNA, RNA, semisynthetic or synthetic origin, or any combination thereof.

The term “nucleic acid” refers to deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleosides, ribonucleosides, or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term also refers to oligonucleotide analogs including PNA (peptidonucleic acid), analogs of DNA used in antisense technology (phosphorothioates, phosphoroamidates, and the like). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (including but not limited to, degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al., Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98 (1994)).

“Conservatively modified variants” applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, “conservatively modified variants” refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are “silent variations,” which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.

As to amino acid sequences, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a “conservatively modified variant” where the alteration results in the deletion of an amino acid, addition of an amino acid, or substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles described herein.

Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and [0139] 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties (W H Freeman & Co.; 2nd edition (December 1993)

The terms “identical” or percent “identity,” in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Sequences are “substantially identical” if they have a percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., about 60% identity, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% identity over a specified region), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms (or other algorithms available to persons of ordinary skill in the art) or by manual alignment and visual inspection. This definition also refers to the complement of a test sequence. The identity can exist over a region that is at least about 50 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or over a region that is 75-100 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or, where not specified, across the entire sequence of a polynucleotide or polypeptide. A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide described herein, including homologs from species other than human, may be obtained by a process comprising the steps of screening a library under stringent hybridization conditions with a labeled probe having a polynucleotide sequence described herein or a fragment thereof, and isolating full-length cDNA and genomic clones containing said polynucleotide sequence. Such hybridization techniques are well known to the skilled artisan.

For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.

A “comparison window”, as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, including but not limited to, by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement)).

One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information available at the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=−4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm is typically performed with the “low complexity” filter turned off.

The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, or less than about 0.01, or less than about 0.001.

The phrase “selectively (or specifically) hybridizes to” refers to the binding, duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under stringent hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA).

The phrase “stringent hybridization conditions” refers to hybridization of sequences of DNA, RNA, or other nucleic acids, or combinations thereof under conditions of low ionic strength and high temperature as is known in the art. Typically, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology—Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, “Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays” (1993).

As used herein, the terms “engineer, engineered, engineering”, are considered to include any manipulation of the peptide backbone or the post-translational modifications of a naturally occurring or recombinant polypeptide or fragment thereof. Engineering includes modifications of the amino acid sequence, of the glycosylation pattern, or of the side chain group of individual amino acids, as well as combinations of these approaches. The engineered proteins are expressed and produced by standard molecular biology techniques.

By “isolated nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide” is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or RNA, which has been removed from its native environment. For example, a recombinant polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide contained in a vector is considered isolated. Further examples of an isolated polynucleotide include recombinant polynucleotides maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) polynucleotides in solution. An isolated polynucleotide includes a polynucleotide molecule contained in cells that ordinarily contain the polynucleotide molecule, but the polynucleotide molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts, as well as positive and negative strand forms, and double-stranded forms. Isolated polynucleotides or nucleic acids described herein, further include such molecules produced synthetically, e.g., via PCR or chemical synthesis. In addition, a polynucleotide or a nucleic acid, in certain embodiments, include a regulatory element such as a promoter, ribosome binding site, or a transcription terminator.

The term “polymerase chain reaction” or “PCR” generally refers to a method for amplification of a desired nucleotide sequence in vitro, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195. In general, the PCR method involves repeated cycles of primer extension synthesis, using oligonucleotide primers capable of hybridising preferentially to a template nucleic acid.

By a nucleic acid or polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% “identical” to a reference nucleotide sequence, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the 5′ or 3′ terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. As a practical matter, whether any particular polynucleotide sequence is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence described herein can be determined conventionally using known computer programs, such as the ones discussed above for polypeptides (e.g. ALIGN-2).

A derivative, or a variant of a polypeptide is said to share “homology” or be “homologous” with the peptide if the amino acid sequences of the derivative or variant has at least 50% identity with a 100 amino acid sequence from the original peptide. In certain embodiments, the derivative or variant is at least 75% the same as that of either the peptide or a fragment of the peptide having the same number of amino acid residues as the derivative. In certain embodiments, the derivative or variant is at least 85% the same as that of either the peptide or a fragment of the peptide having the same number of amino acid residues as the derivative. In certain embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the derivative is at least 90% the same as the peptide or a fragment of the peptide having the same number of amino acid residues as the derivative. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the derivative is at least 95% the same as the peptide or a fragment of the peptide having the same number of amino acid residues as the derivative. In certain embodiments, the derivative or variant is at least 99% the same as that of either the peptide or a fragment of the peptide having the same number of amino acid residues as the derivative.

The term “modified,” as used herein refers to any changes made to a given polypeptide, such as changes to the length of the polypeptide, the amino acid sequence, chemical structure, co-translational modification, or post-translational modification of a polypeptide. The form “(modified)” term means that the polypeptides being discussed are optionally modified, that is, the polypeptides under discussion can be modified or unmodified.

In some aspects, an antigen-binding construct comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical to a relevant amino acid sequence or fragment thereof set forth in the Table(s) or accession number(s) disclosed herein. In some aspects, an isolated antigen-binding construct comprises an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide that is at least 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or 100% identical to a relevant nucleotide sequence or fragment thereof set forth in Table(s) or accession number(s) disclosed herein.

### Example 1: Affinity-Improved Anti-HER2 Antibodies Based on Pertuzumab

The variable region of the anti-HER2 antibody pertuzumab was engineered to identify mutations that increased the affinity of the engineered antibody for HER2. The engineered antibodies, e.g. variants or antigen-binding constructs, were prepared in two formats: a monovalent, one-armed (OA) format, and a bivalent, mono-specific, full-sized antibody (FSA) format. FIG. 1 provides a representation of a select number of different antibody or antigen-binding construct formats described herein and is not meant to be a complete description of potential formats for the antigen-binding constructs. FIG. 1A represents an example of an OA format, while FIG. 1B represents one example of an FSA format.

Table 1 identifies variant antigen-binding constructs in the OA format, with mutations in the variable region of the heavy and/or light chains of pertuzumab. The antigen-binding constructs in Table 1 have a heterodimeric Fc containing the following mutations in the CH3 domain: HC (heavy chain) with Pertuzumab Fab: T350V_L351Y_F405A_Y407V; HC with no Fab, including hinge: T350V_T366L_K392L_T394W. The amino acid residues in the Fc region are identified according to the EU index as in Kabat referring to the numbering of the EU antibody (Edelman et al., 1969, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63:78-85). The location of the mutations, whether in the CDRs or the framework regions, is also noted. The CDRs were identified according to the IMGT system as described for example in Lefranc, M. P. et al. (2003) Dev. Comp. Immunol. 27:55-77. Variant 10013 is wild-type pertuzumab in OA format, with the Fc mutations described above.

Additional variants were prepared based on single mutations that increased the affinity of pertuzumab for HER2, as described in Vajdos et al., 2002 J. Mol. Biol. 320:415-428. These additional variants included the single mutations described in Vajdos et al. (literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs), as well as combinations of the mutations described in Vajdos et al. Table 2 identifies the additional variant Pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs that were prepared in the OA format. The antigen-binding constructs in Table 2 have the same heterodimeric Fc as those in Table 1, containing the following mutations in the CH3 domain: HC with Pertuzumab Fab: T350V_L351Y_F405A_Y407V; HC with no Fab: T350V_T366L_K392L_T394W. Variants 12610 and 12611 include single mutations as described in Vajdos et al. Variant 10014 is a variant that includes a combination of the mutations in the latter two variants.

Table 3 identifies variant pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs, in the FSA format, with mutations in the variable region of the heavy and/or light chains. The amino acid residues in the variable domain are identified according to Kabat (as described in Kabat and Wu, 1991; Kabat et al, Sequences of proteins of immunological interest. 5th Edition—US Department of Health and Human Services, NIH publication no. 91-3242, p 647 (1991)). The antigen-binding constructs in Table 3 have a wild type Fc. Variant 6322 is wild-type pertuzumab having the HC amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, and the LC amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:10.

The position of the mutations described in Tables 1-3 with respect to SEQ ID NO:2 (VH domain of pertuzumab) or SEQ ID NO:11 (VL domain of pertuzumab) can be determined with reference to the Sequence Table and Numbering Key found at the end of the Examples. The antigen-binding constructs described above were prepared as described in Example 2.

### Example 2: Preparation of Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs with Improved Affinity for HER2

The antigen-binding constructs and controls described in Example 1 were cloned and expressed as follows. The genes encoding the antibody heavy and light chains were constructed via gene synthesis using codons optimized for human/mammalian expression. The Pertuzumab Fab sequence was generated from a known HER2/neu domain 2 binding Ab (Adams C W et al. (2006) Humanization of a recombinant monoclonal antibody to produce a therapeutic her dimerization inhibitor, Pertuzumab. Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2006;55(6):717-27). Gene synthesis was used to generate v9996 and v12471 in which framework residues A49 and L69 were changed.

The final gene products were sub-cloned into the mammalian expression vector PTT5 (NRC-BRI, Canada) and expressed in CHO cells (Durocher, Y., Perret, S. & Kamen, A. High-level and high-throughput recombinant protein production by transient transfection of suspension-growing CHO cells. Nucleic acids research 30, e9 (2002)).

Antigen-binding constructs in OA format were prepared in 50 mL cultures of CHO cells, while those in FSA format were prepared in 500 mL cultures of CHO cells. CHO cells were transfected in exponential growth phase (1.5 to 2 million cells/ml) with aqueous 1 mg/ml 25 kDa polyethylenimine (PEI, polysciences) at a PEI:DNA ratio of 2.5:1.(Raymond C. et al. A simplified polyethylenimine-mediated transfection process for large-scale and high-throughput applications. Methods. 55(1):44-51 (2011)). To determine the optimal concentration range for forming heterodimers for antigen-binding constructs containing an heterodimeric Fc, the DNA was transfected in optimal DNA ratios of the heavy chain a (HC-A), light chain (LC), and heavy chain B (HC-B) that allow for heterodimer formation (e.g. HC-A/HC-B/LC ratios=30:30:40. Transfected cells were harvested after 5-6 days with the culture medium collected after centrifugation at 4000 rpm and clarified using a 0.45 μm filter.

Protein A Purification

The clarified culture medium was loaded onto a MabSelect SuRe (GE Healthcare) protein-A column and washed with 10 column volumes of PBS buffer at pH 7.2. The antibody was eluted with 10 column volumes of citrate buffer at pH 3.6 with the pooled fractions containing the antibody neutralized with TRIS at pH 11. The OA antigen-binding constructs were produced with a yield of 50-80 mg/L, and the FSA antigen-binding constructs were produced with a yield of about 30 mg/L.

Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)

In some cases, the protein-A antibody eluate was further purified by gel filtration (SEC). For gel filtration, 3.5 mg of the antibody mixture was concentrated to 1.5 mL and loaded onto a Sephadex 200 HiLoad 16/600 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) via an AKTA Express FPLC at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. PBS buffer at pH 7.4 was used at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. Fractions corresponding to the purified antibody were collected, concentrated to ˜1 mg/mL.

Analysis of Heterodimer Purity

For the OA constructs, heterodimer purity (i.e. amount of OA with a heterodimeric Fc) was assessed by non-reducing High Throughput Protein Express assay using Caliper LabChip GXII (Perkin Elmer #760499). Procedures were carried out according to HT Protein Express LabChip User Guide version2 LabChip GXII User Manual, with the following modifications. Heterodimer samples, at either 2 μl or 5 μl (concentration range 5-2000 ng/μl), were added to separate wells in 96 well plates (BioRad # HSP9601) along with 7 μl of HT Protein Express Sample Buffer (Perkin Elmer #760328). The heterodimer samples were then denatured at 70° C. for 15 mins. The LabChip instrument is operated using the HT Protein Express Chip (Perkin Elmer #760499) and the Ab-200 assay setting. After use, the chip was cleaned with MilliQ water and stored at 4° C.

### Example 3: Affinity of Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs as Measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance

The effect of amino acid substitutions on the affinity of the variant antigen-binding constructs for HER2 was tested using Surface Plasmon Resonance. The experiment was carried out as follows.

The experimental set up is summarized in the following table:

The affinity towards HER2 ECD of the samples was measured by SPR on a Biacore T200 as follows. Between 2000 and 4000 RU of anti-human Fc injected at concentration between 5 and 10 μg/ml was immobilized on a CM5 chip using standard amine coupling. Antigen-binding constructs were captured on the anti-human Fc (injected at concentration at 0.51 microg/mL in PBST, 1 min at 10 microl/min) at response levels ranging from 120-270 RU. Recombinant human HER2 was diluted in PBST and injected at starting concentration of either 3.25 nM, 7.5 nM, 15 nM, 30 nM or 60 nM and injected at a flow rate of 100 microl/min for 200 seconds, followed by dissociation for another 30 minutes at the end of the last injection. HER2 dilutions were analyzed in duplicates. Sensograms were fit globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, using the software provided with the Biacore T200. All experiments were conducted at 25° C.

The affinity of antigen-binding constructs in OA format was determined by SPR following protein A purification. Selected affinity-improved antigen-binding constructs were then assessed to determine heterodimer purity and further purified by SEC prior to a second SPR measurement. Antigen-binding constructs in FSA format were purified by protein A affinity and SEC prior to assessment of affinity by SPR.

Tables 5 and 6 show the ratios of the association constant of the antigen-binding constructs versus the WT pertuzumab (v10013) in OA format. Table 7 shows the ratios of the association constant of the antigen-binding constructs versus the WT pertuzumab (v6322) in FSA format. Kd represents the equilibrium dissociation constant, while Ka represents the association constant.

Table 5 demonstrates that some antigen-binding constructs displayed decreased affinity towards the HER2 ECD compared to the OA pertuzumab control, while other antigen-binding constructs displayed increased affinity towards the HER2 ECD. Of the antigen-binding constructs that displayed increased affinity, most displayed an increase between about 2-fold to 6-fold over wild-type. Variant 9996 displayed about a 10-fold increase in affinity, while variant 12506 displayed about a 30-fold increase in affinity versus wild-type.

The affinity of antigen-binding constructs with combinations of the literature mutations tested is shown in Table 6. The majority of these antigen-binding constructs showed an increase in affinity over wild-type pertuzumab in the OA format, in the range of about 2-fold to 8-fold.

The affinity of the antigen-binding constructs tested in FSA format is shown in Table 7. Variant 12471 displayed an increase in affinity of about 8.5-fold compared to wild-type pertuzumab in FSA format. The effect of combining these mutations was tested as shown in subsequent Examples.

### Example 4: Measurement of Thermal Stability of Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs by Differential Scanning Calorimetry

The thermal stability of the Fabs of the antigen-binding constructs was determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as follows. Each antigen-binding construct was purified by protein A chromatography and SEC as described in Example 2. The antigen-binding construct was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in PBS, and a total of 400 μL was used for DSC analysis with a VP-Capillary DSC (GE Healthcare). At the start of each DSC run, five buffer blank injections were performed to stabilize the baseline, and a buffer injection was made before each antigen-binding construct injection for referencing. Each sample was scanned from 20 to 100° C. at a 60° C./hr rate, with low feedback, 8 sec filter, 5 min preTstat, and 70 psi nitrogen pressure. The resulting thermograms were referenced and analyzed using Origin 7 software.

Thermal unfolding curves for selected antigen-binding constructs are shown in FIG. 2, where FIG. 2A compares the thermograms of v9996 vs. wild-type v10013; FIG. 2B compares the thermograms of v12506 vs. wild-type v10013, and FIG. 2C compares the thermograms of v12534 vs. wild-type v10013. The first transition in the wild-type v10013 corresponds to the melting temperature of the CH2 domain, the second transition corresponds to the melting temperature of the Fab, and the third transition corresponds to the melting temperature of the CH3 domain. The difference in melting temperature (Tm) of the Fab transition of all antigen-binding constructs tested compared to wild-type pertuzumab in OA format are shown in Table 8A below. Antigen-binding constructs for which Tm was not measured are noted by “n/d.” The difference in melting temperature (Tm) of the Fab transition of all literature antigen-binding constructs tested compared to wild-type pertuzumab in OA format are shown in Table 8B below. The Tm of the Fab transition of wild-type pertuzumab in OA format (variant 10013) is 77.2° C.

The DSC results indicated that in most cases, the antigen-binding constructs showed minimal change to the Tm, or a decrease in Tm of less than 3° C. In particular, variant 9996 showed only a 0.4° C. drop in Tm compared to wild-type pertuzumab. Variants 12506 and 12536 showed a decrease in Tm of about 4 to 5° C.

### Example 5: Measurement of Binding Affinity of a Variant Antigen-Binding Construct in FSA Format to Whole Cells by Flow Cytometry

The following experiment was performed to measure the ability of an exemplary affinity matured antigen-binding construct in FSA format (v12471) to bind to cells expressing varying levels of HER2 in comparison to controls. The cell lines used were SKOV3 (HER2 3+), SKBR3 (HER2 3+), MCF7 (HER2 1+) and BT-474 (HER2 3+). The wild-type pertuzumab in FSA format (v6322) was used as a control. The ability of v12471 and v6322 to bind to the HER2 expressing (HER2+) cells was determined as described below, with specific measurement of Bmax and B50.

Binding of the test antigen-binding constructs to the surface of HER2+ cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in DMEM at 1×105 cells/100 μl. 100 μl cell suspension was added into each microcentrifuge tube, followed by 10 μl/tube of the antigen-binding constructs. The tubes were incubated for 2 hr at 4° C. on a rotator. The microcentrifuge tubes were centrifuged for 2 min 2000 RPM at room temperature and the cell pellets washed with 500 μl media. Each cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of fluorochrome-labelled secondary antibody diluted in media to 2 μg/sample. The samples were then incubated for 1 hr at 4° C. on a rotator. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 2000 rpm and washed in media. The cells were resuspended in 500 μl media, filtered, transferred to a tube containing 5 μl propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The B50 of the tested antigen-binding constructs was assessed by FACS with data analysis and curve fitting performed in GraphPad Prism. The experiment was carried out once (n=1) in SKBr3 cells, and twice (n=2) in SKOV3, MCF7, and BT-474 cells.

A summary of the B50 and Bmax values measured for each cell line are shown in Tables 9-12.

The binding curves are shown in FIG. 3. FIG. 3A (linear scale) and FIG. 3B (logarithmic scale) show binding curves in SKBR3 cells; FIG. 3C (linear scale) and FIG. 3C (logarithmic scale) show binding curves in SKOV3 cells; FIG. 3E (linear scale) and FIG. 3F (logarithmic scale) show binding curves in BT-474 cells; FIG. 3G (linear scale) and FIG. 3H (logarithmic scale) show binding curves in MCF7 cells.

This example shows that v12471 and v6322 bind to cells expressing varying levels of HER2.

### Example 6: Ability of a Variant Antigen-Binding Construct in FSA Format to Inhibit Cell Growth

The ability of the antigen-binding constructs in FSA format (v12471 and the control pertuzumab variant 6322) to inhibit growth of cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of HER2 was examined. The cell lines tested were SKBR3 (HER2 3+), MCF7 (HER2 1+) and BT-474 (HER2 3+). The growth inhibitory activity of the tested constructs was also tested in BT-474 cells in the presence of exogenous growth-stimulatory ligands (EGF and HRG).

Test antigen-binding constructs and/or exogenous ligand (10 ng/mL HRG or 50 ng/mL EGF) were added to the target cells in triplicate and incubated for 5 days (for the MCF7 and SKBR3 cells) or 6 days (for BT474 cells) at 37° C. Cell viability was measured using AlamarBlue™ (37° C. for 2 hr), absorbance read at 530/580 nm. Data was normalized to untreated control and analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism.

The results are shown in Tables 13-15, and FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4A shows growth inhibition by the antigen-binding constructs as a function of concentration in MCF7 cells, while FIG. 4B shows growth inhibition by the antigen-binding constructs as a function of concentration in SKBR3 cells. FIG. 5A shows growth inhibition in BT-474 cells in the absence of exogenous growth-stimulatory ligand, while FIGS. 5B and 5C show growth inhibition in BT-474 cells in the presence of HRG and EGF, respectively. Tables 13-15 summarize the growth inhibition observed in SKBR3, MCF7, and BT-474 cells respectively, in terms of potency (IC50) and efficacy (percentage of cells killed, or span) where NA=No detectable growth inhibition observed.

The control pertuzumab variant 6322 and the increased-affinity variant 12471 were able to inhibit growth of SKBr3 cells, with v12471 having increased efficacy vs 6322. Both variants were unable to inhibit growth of MCF7 cells.

The WT v6322 showed no growth inhibitory activity in BT-474 cells, but v12471 showed low growth inhibitory activity in the absence of ligand stimulation (FIG. 5A). Under ligand-stimulated conditions, v6322 and v12471 showed maximal growth inhibition of about 30% in the presence of EGF (FIG. 5C), but were unable to inhibit growth in the presence of heregulin.

### Example 7: Assessment of Affinity of Literature Pertuzumab Variants for HER2 by SPR

As indicated in Example 1, Vajdos et al. identified pertuzumab variants having improved affinity for HER2. The Vajdos et al. pertuzumab variants are referred to herein as “literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs.” These variants were identified by alanine scanning and homolog scanning to identify the side chains of CDR residues that contribute to antigen binding. The Vajdos et al. publication measured the affinity of the literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs by calculating a function ratio (Fwt/mut) for each variant based on an ELISA, where Fwt/mut values greater than 1.0 indicated a deleterious mutation, and ratios less than 1.0 indicated a mutation that improved the affinity of pertuzumab for HER2. In order to facilitate comparison between the variant antigen-binding constructs described herein and the literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs, selected literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs were prepared following the procedures described in Example 2, and the affinity of these constructs was assessed by SPR, as described in Example 3. Table 16 shows the results of the SPR binding assay for the literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs as well as the function ratios from the Vajdos et al. publication for reference.

Table 16 demonstrates that direct measurement of the affinity of the literature pertuzumab antigen-binding constructs for ECD2 of HER2 using the SPR assay described herein yields fold increases in affinity over wild-type that are different from those determined using measurement of function ratios (compare data in column 3 to data in column 6). The greatest discrepancy was observed for variant 4435, for which a 7.7-fold increase in function ratio was reported in the Vajdos publication, while no significant increase in affinity vs. wild-type pertuzumab was measured by SPR. Thus, the affinity measurements of the literature pertuzumab variants as measured by the SPR assay described herein were used as a benchmark in order to compare the changes in affinity of the variant antigen-binding constructs versus the literature pertuzumab variants.

### Example 8: Design and Preparation of Combination Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs Based on Selected 1X Amino Acid Substitution Variants, and Measurement of Affinity for ECD2 of HER2 by SPR

Based on the data shown in Example 3, variant antigen-binding constructs showing a 2-fold or greater increase in affinity for ECD2 of HER2 were identified as shown in Table 17 below. Table 17 also includes the calculated difference in Gibbs free energy, or ΔΔG (DDG), of binding between the WT and each mutant. This value provides a measure of the gain (if negative) or loss (if positive) in energy for binding upon introducing the mutation in question.

In order to determine whether the 1X amino acid substitutions described in Table 17 could be combined to further improve the affinity of these variant antigen-binding constructs for ECD2 of HER2, a large number of potential 2X, 3X, and 4X combinations were identified and from this group a select number of variants with 2X, 3X, and 4X combinations were evaluated and tested, in OA format. These variants are referred to as combination variant antigen-binding constructs. The variants were tested in OA format in order to assess affinity for HER2 in the absence of avidity.

These combination variant antigen-binding constructs were expressed as described in Example 2, and purified by protein A chromatography as described in Example 2. The affinity for ECD2 of HER2 was measured by SPR at 25° C., as described in Example 3. Table 18 provides an identification of the combination variant antigen-binding constructs tested and affinity measurements of these constructs for ECD2 of HER2, including the measured kinetic association rate (ka), the measured kinetic dissociation rate (kd), the calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), the fold improvement in affinity over wild-type pertuzumab, and DDG values for the selected combination variants. NB indicates “no binding” and n/d indicates “not determined.”

The majority of the combination variant antigen-binding constructs tested showed an increase in affinity for ECD2 of HER2 vs wild-type pertuzumab (v10013) that was greater than that of each individual amino acid substitution of the combination. FIG. 6 provides a summary of the combinations that increased affinity vs wild-type pertuzumab and their Ka, and shows that the Ka improved with respect to the number of 1X mutations used. The 1X amino acid substitution H_K75W (v12506) exhibited a very large increase in affinity compared to pertuzumab, and combinations containing this substitution, whether as 2X (v14024-v14029), 3X (v14043-v14049), or 4X (v14055-14059) consistently showed larger increases in affinity for HER2 ECD2 compared to wild-type pertuzumab than did combination variant antigen-binding constructs without this mutation.

A subset of combinations was found to result in a decrease in affinity for ECD2 of HER2 vs. wild-type pertuzumab. This subset of combinations included the amino acid substitutions H_S99W+L_Y96G, present in variants with no detectable binding (e.g. 14036 and 14061), reduced binding (e.g. 14052), or very moderate increase in binding (e.g. 14057, 14058, 14060).

### Example 9: Measurement of Thermal Stability of Selected Combination Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)

The thermal stability (Tm) of the Fab region of the selected combination variant antigen-binding constructs listed in Table 18 was assessed by DSC, as described in Example 4. Table 19 provides the Tm values of the Fab region (Fab Tm), as well as the change in the Tm values for the Fab compared to wt pertuzumab (Fab ΔTm).

All of the Fabs combination variant antigen-binding constructs exhibited Tm values that were within 10° C. of the WT. However, a number of combination variant antigen-binding construct were within 5° C. of the WT, including v14029, v14032, v14035, v14039, v14062, and v14067. All of the Fab Tm values were 70° C. or higher, suggesting that these combination variant antigen-binding constructs are potentially amenable to large scale manufacturing.

**Example 10: Measurement of Binding of Selected Combination Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs in FSA Format in Cells Expressing HER2 by Flow Cytometry**

In order to test functional characteristics of the combination variant antigen-binding constructs, a number of these constructs were prepared in FSA format, as described in Example 2. The ability of these constructs, v14018, v14019, v14020, v14021, v14022, as well as v12471 and wild-type pertuzumab in FSA format (v6322) to bind to cells expressing HER2 was tested as described in Example 5, with specific measurement of Bmax and B50 (concentration at which 50% of Bmax is achieved) values. The cell lines tested were SKBR3 (HER2 3+), MCF7 (HER2 1+) and BT-474 (HER2 3+). A summary of the B50 and Bmax values measured for binding to SKBR3 and BT-474 cells are shown in Table 20, while the B50 and Bmax values measured for binding to MCF7 cells are shown in Table 21. The experiment was performed once (n=1) in each cell line.

As shown above, all variant antigen-binding constructs displayed similar Bmax values, and only small differences in B50 values were observed. This experiment demonstrates that the combination variant antigen-binding constructs tested are capable of binding to HER2 expressed on the surface of BT-474 cells, SKBr3 cells and MCF7 cells.

**Example 11: Ability of Combination Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs in FSA Format to Inhibit Cell Growth in HER2 3+ Cells**

The ability of selected combination variant antigen-binding constructs in FSA format to inhibit growth of cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of HER2 was examined and compared to wild-type pertuzumab (v6322). The following cell lines were tested: SKBR3 (HER2 3+), and BT-474 (HER2 3+), and growth inhibition was measured as described in Example 6, except that the BT-474 cells were incubated for 6 days instead of 5 days. The growth inhibitory activity of the tested constructs was also tested in BT-474 cells in the presence of the exogenous growth-stimulatory ligand EGF (epidermal growth factor). Each combination variant antigen-binding construct was tested in duplicate.

The results are shown in FIGS. 7, 8 and 9. FIGS. 7A to 7G depict the growth inhibition plots for variant antigen-binding constructs 12471, 14018, 14019, 14020, 14021, 14022, and 14023 vs. wild-type v6322, respectively, in SKBr3 cells. FIGS. 8A to 8G depict the growth inhibition plots for variant antigen-binding constructs 14019, 12471, 14018, 14020, 14021, 14022, and 14023 vs. wild-type v6322, respectively, in BT-474 cells. FIGS. 9A to 9G depict the growth inhibition plots for variant antigen-binding constructs 12471, 14019, 14018, 14020, 14021, 14022, and 14023 vs. wild-type v6322, respectively, in BT-474 cells in the presence of EGF.

FIGS. 7 to 9 indicate that there was no significant difference in the potency between the variants and the WT, as measured by IC50 in any of the cell types tested. In contrast, significant differences in the efficacy were observed, where variants with enhanced affinity showed enhanced efficacy as reflected in increased percentage of cells that had reduced viability. The average of the observed efficacy of the two independent runs, standard error divided by the average, and ratio of the efficacy (span) with respect to the WT are shown below in Table 22 (SKBr3 cells), Table 23 (BT-474 cells), and Table 24 (BT-474 +EGF).

In order to determine if there was a correlation between the affinity of the variants and the observed efficacy, the affinity at 25° C. of the corresponding OA variant (as measured in Example 8) was compared with the observed efficacy and summarized in Table 25 for SKBr3 cells, and in Table 26 for BT-474 cells in the presence and absence of EGF.

FIG. 10 demonstrates the correlation between affinity of the Fab and the corresponding efficacy of the FSA antibody in SKBr3 cells (FIG. 10A), BT-474 cells (FIG. 10B), and BT-474 cells in the presence of EGF (FIG. 10C).

The ability of the combination variant antigen-binding constructs to inhibit growth of JIMT-1, MCF7 and MALME-3M cells was also tested using the methods described in this Example. In these cell line, neither WT nor the combination variant antigen-binding constructs were able to inhibit cell growth (data not shown). These cells line express low levels of HER2 and the lack of growth inhibition observed is expected as these cell lines are not typically responsive to HER2-targeting antibodies.

**Example 12: Ability of Combination Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs in FSA Format to Inhibit Cell Growth in Gastric Cancer Cells Expressing HER2**

The ability of combination variant antigen-binding constructs to inhibit growth of non-breast cancer high HER2-expressing cell lines was tested in FSA format and compared to wild-type pertuzumab (v6322). The growth inhibition experiment was carried out in the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N87, classified as HER2 3+, according to the method described in Example 11, except the constructs were tested in triplicate, and the cells were incubated for 5 days. The measured potencies and efficacies are summarized in Table 27. Growth inhibition curves for each antigen-binding construct vs. wild-type pertuzumab are shown in FIGS. 11A-G.

Table 27 and FIG. 11 demonstrate that all of the combination variant antigen-binding constructs tested were more efficacious and more potent in inhibiting growth of NCI-N87 cells than the wild type pertuzumab control (v6322).

**Example 13: Ability of Combination Variant Antigen-Binding Constructs in FSA Format to Inhibit Cell Growth in Low HER2-Expressing Cancer Cells**

The ability of combination variant antigen-binding constructs to inhibit growth of a low HER2-expressing breast cell line was tested in FSA format and compared to wild-type pertuzumab (v6322). The growth inhibition experiment was carried out in MDA-MB-175 cells, classified as HER2 1+ (see Crocker et al., Cancer Res. (2005) 65:253), as described in Example 6, except that the antigen-binding constructs were tested in triplicate, and the cells were incubated for 5 days. The measured potencies and efficacies are summarized in Table 28. Growth inhibition curves for the tested antigen-binding constructs vs. wild-type pertuzumab are shown in FIG. 12.

This experiment demonstrates that in the low HER2-expressing cell line MDA-MB-175, the efficacy of the tested combination variant antigen-binding constructs is similar to that of the WT. However, the potency of the variants is higher than the potency of the WT.

**Example 14: Preparation of Biparatopic Anti-HER2 Antigen-Binding Constructs Comprising Antigen-Binding Polypeptide Constructs with Improved Affinity for ECD2 of HER2**

A number of exemplary anti-HER2 biparatopic antibodies (or antigen-binding constructs) and controls were prepared as described below. FIG. 1 depicts a number of antigen-binding construct formats, including exemplary biparatopic formats C, D, and E. In these biparatopic formats, the heterodimeric Fc is depicted with one chain (Chain A) shown in black and the other (Chain B) shown in grey, while one antigen-binding domain (1) is shown in hatched fill, while the other antigen-binding domain (2) is shown in white. Biparatopic anti-HER2 antigen-binding constructs were prepared in format D, where the ECD2-binding arm was either wt pertuzumab or included amino acid substitutions that improved the affinity of pertuzumab for ECD2, and was in the Fab format (hatched fill). The second arm was based on trastuzumab in an scFv format (white) and binds to ECD4.

These antibodies were cloned and expressed as follows. The genes encoding the antibody heavy and light chains of Pertuzumab with mutations T350V_L351Y_F405A_Y407V described in example 1 were used. For the other heavy chain, an scFv of Trastuzumab Fab sequence was generated from a known HER2/neu domain 4 binding antibody (Carter P. et al. (1992) Humanization of an anti p185 HER2 antibody for human cancer therapy. Proc Natl Acad Sci 89, 4285.) And the Fc was an IgG1 isotype. The scFv sequence was generated from the VH and VL domains of Trastuzumab using a glycine-serine linker (Carter P. et al. (1992) Humanization of an anti p185 her2 antibody for human cancer therapy. Proc Natl Acad Sci 89, 4285.).

The final gene products were sub-cloned into the mammalian expression vector PTT5 (NRC-BRI, Canada) and expressed in CHO cells (Durocher, Y., Perret, S. & Kamen, A. High-level and high-throughput recombinant protein production by transient transfection of suspension-growing CHO cells. Nucleic acids research 30, e9 (2002)).

The CHO cells were transfected in exponential growth phase (1.5 to 2 million cells/ml) with aqueous 1 mg/ml 25 kDa polyethylenimine (PEI, polysciences) at a PEI:DNA ratio of 2.5:1.(Raymond C. et al. A simplified polyethylenimine-mediated transfection process for large-scale and high-throughput applications. Methods. 55(1):44-51 (2011)). To determine the optimal concentration range for forming heterodimers, the DNA was transfected in optimal DNA ratios of the heavy chain a (HC-A), light chain (LC), and heavy chain B (HC-B) that allow for heterodimer formation (e.g. HC-A/HC-B/LC ratios=30:30:40. Transfected cells were harvested after 5-6 days with the culture medium collected after centrifugation at 4000 rpm and clarified using a 0.45 μm filter.

The clarified culture medium was loaded onto a MabSelect SuRe (GE Healthcare) protein-A column and washed with 10 column volumes of PBS buffer at pH 7.2. The antibody was eluted with 10 column volumes of citrate buffer at pH 3.6 with the pooled fractions containing the antibody neutralized with TRIS at pH 11.

The protein-A antibody eluate was further purified by gel filtration (SEC). For gel filtration, 3.5 mg of the antibody mixture was concentrated to 1.5 mL and loaded onto a Sephadex 200 HiLoad 16/600 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) via an AKTA Express FPLC at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. PBS buffer at pH 7.4 was used at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. Fractions corresponding to the purified antibody were collected, concentrated to ˜1 mg/mL.

Table 29 identifies the biparatopic anti-HER2 antigen-binding constructs prepared along with the corresponding FSA and OA version for comparison.

**Example 15: Ability of Biparatopic Anti-HER2 Antigen-Binding Constructs to be Internalized in HER2-Expressing Cells**

The ability of the biparatopic antigen-binding constructs described in Example 14 to be internalized was assessed by a direct internalization experiment. The direct internalization method was carried out according to the protocol detailed in Schmidt, M. et al., Kinetics of anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody internalization: effects of affinity, bivalency, and stability. Cancer Immunol Immunother (2008) 57:1879-1890. Specifically, the antibodies were directly labeled using the AlexaFluor® 488 Protein Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. A10235), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Internalization was measured MCF7 cells (HER2 1+), JIMT-1 cells (HER2 2+) and SKOV3 cells (HER2 3+).

For the internalization assay, 12 well plates were seeded with 1×105 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37° C.+5% CO2. The following day, the labeled antibodies were added at 200 nM in DMEM+10% FBS and incubated 24 hours at 37° C.+5% CO2. Under dark conditions, media was aspirated and wells were washed 2×500 μL PBS. To harvest cells, cell dissociation buffer was added (250 μL) at 37° C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μL DMEM+10% FBS without or with anti-Alexa Fluor 488, rabbit IgG fraction (Molecular Probes, A11094) at 50 μg/mL, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Prior to analysis 300 μL DMEM+10% FBS the samples filtered 4 μl propidium iodide was added. Samples were analyzed using the LSRII flow cytometer. The detected MFI values were divided by the UV-determined fluorophore-to-antibody ratio (DAR) to normalize the values and allow for a direct comparison of the variants. Independent repeats in the past have shown that the Standard Error/Average in JIMT-1 cells was 4%, 10% and 2% for the DAR-normalized MFI of Surface 4° C., Surface 37° C. and Internal 37° C., respectively.

Tables 30, 31 and 32 shows the results of detectable surface and internal antibody in HER2 1+ MCF7, HER2 2+ JIMT-1, and HER2 3+ SKOV3 cells, respectively, following 24 h incubation with 200 nM of the exemplary anti-HER2 biparatopic antibodies with WT Pertuzumab (v7091) or with the constructs demonstrating increased affinity for ECD2 of HER2 compared to pertuzumab.

The surface 4° C. DAR-normalized MFI measurement was taken at 4° C., prior to incubation at 37° C., before internalization occurred. Hence, it is representative of the amount of HER2 receptors present on the cells. As shown in Tables 30 to 32, the MFI at 4° C. increased from below 100 in the HER2 1+ MCF7 cell line, to ˜500 in the HER2 2+ JIMT-1 cell line, and to ˜4500 in the HER2 3+ SKOV3 cell line. During incubation at 37° C., internalization occurred, and the number of surface receptors decreased. More importantly, antibodies accumulated inside the cell, and the internal 37° C. DAR-normalized MFI is indicative of the level of accumulation. This data shows that the biparatopic antigen-binding constructs tested here are internalized in the cell lines tested.

**Example 16: Framework Mutations Increase Stability and Do Not Affect Binding Affinity**

As indicated in example 10, the FSA antigen-binding constructs included the framework amino acid substitutions A49G and L69F in addition to the amino acid substitution that improved the affinity of pertuzumab. To determine the effect of the A49G and L69F substitutions, a variant with those mutations (v9996) was expressed as described in Example 2 in OA format, and evaluated for binding affinity by SPR at 25 C as described in Example 3 and stability as described in Example 4. The results are summarized in Table 33.

By comparing SPR data for v9996 and v10014, it can be concluded that the H_A49G/L69F mutations had little effect on binding affinity to HER2. However, the DSC data showed that the H_A49G/L69F mutations increased the thermal stability of the variants by about 2° C.
