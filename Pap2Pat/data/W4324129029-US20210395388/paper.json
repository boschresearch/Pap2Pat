    "abstract": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an oncogenic role in breast, gastric and other solid tumors. However, anti-HER2 therapies are only currently approved for the treatment of breast and gastric/gastric esophageal junction cancers and treatment resistance remains a problem. Here, we engineer an anti-HER2 IgG1 bispecific, biparatopic antibody (Ab), zanidatamab, with unique and enhanced functionalities compared to both trastuzumab and the combination of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (tras + pert). Zanidatamab binds adjacent HER2 molecules in trans and initiates distinct HER2 reorganization, as shown by polarized cell surface HER2 caps and large HER2 clusters, not observed with trastuzumab or tras + pert. Moreover, zanidatamab, but not trastuzumab nor tras + pert, elicit potent complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against high HER2-expressing tumor cells in vitro. Zanidatamab also mediates HER2 internalization and downregulation, inhibition of both cell signaling and tumor growth, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP), and also shows superior in vivo antitumor activity compared to tras + pert in a HER2-expressing xenograft model. Collectively, we show that zanidatamab has multiple and distinct mechanisms of action derived from the structural effects of biparatopic HER2 engagement.",

                "HER2 is overexpressed in approximately 20% of breast and gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers and is a validated therapeutic target for antitumor therapy1\u20133. HER2 overexpression activates a variety of signaling pathways leading to cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis4. Unlike other members of the EGFR family, HER2 is capable of constitutive activity, initiating signaling pathways without the need for a bound, activating ligand. HER2 overexpression further leads to HER2 homodimerization and heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR family which can subsequently activate signaling pathways leading to tumor growth. Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) is a classical monoclonal (monospecific) antibody (Ab) that binds to the extracellular domain 4 (ECD4) of HER2 and was the first FDA-approved HER2-targeted therapy for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer as well as gastric/ gastric esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma5. Trastuzumab mediates its antitumor activity via the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation6, suppression of cell signaling 7 and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)8. Pertuzumab (Perjeta\u00ae) is another HER2-targeting monospecific Ab that binds to the ECD2 and blocks ligand-induced heterodimer-driven activation9. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab have also been evaluated in combination (tras + pert), which has shown enhanced antitumor activity pre-clinically10 and clinically11 for HER2-positive breast cancer.",
                "Several anti-HER2 agents, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, neratinib, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), and trastuzumab deruxtecan have been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Outside of breast cancer, trastuzumab and trastuzumab deruxtecan are approved for the treatment of gastric cancers3. However, the clinical benefit of other approved anti-HER2 therapies, such as lapatinib, T-DM1, and pertuzumab, have not universally translated to HER2-positive gastric cancer. In particular, tras + pert plus chemotherapy did not significantly improve OS compared to trastuzumab plus chemo in HER2-expressing gastric/GEJ cancer12.",
                "Beyond breast and gastric cancer, HER2 overexpression has been described in other solid tumors, including biliary tract cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer, among others3, but HER2 therapies have yet to have achieved approval in those cancers. Moreover, intrinsic and acquired resistance to approved HER2 therapies remains a clinical issue as many patients show disease progression over time13. Thus, to extend clinical benefit of HER2-targeted therapies to other HER2-expressing solid tumors, and to treat patients with recurrent or metastatic disease that have progressed after standard of care therapy, there is a need for novel anti-HER2 therapies that have greater antitumor activity and differentiated mechanisms of action (MOA)3.",
                "In efforts to engineer anti-HER2 therapies with increased antitumor activity, several anti-HER2 bispecific (biparatopic) Abs have been reported to have enhanced antitumor activity compared to trastuzumab or parental Ab combinations14\u201318. Biparatopic Abs are a class of bispecific Ab that target two non-overlapping epitopes on the same target. These anti-HER2 biparatopic Abs show increased receptor internalization and receptor degradation17,19, likely promoted by receptor crosslinking20\u201322, which results in enhanced tumor growth inhibition activity. However, none of these biparatopic Abs demonstrated unique cytotoxic antitumor mechanisms that were absent from the parental Ab or parental Ab combinations. As a result, biparatopic Abs to date have been described as a type of \u2018combinatorial\u2019 bispecific since they do not provide additional functionalities compared to combinations of parental Abs with the same specificities23.",
                "Antitumor Abs often show a variety of MOAs that may operate simultaneously and overlap with each other, such as neutralization of the target antigen and activation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Engagement of the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathway has been proposed as a mechanism to increase the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor Abs24 and is one of the reported MOA for B-cell targeting monoclonal Abs including rituximab and ofatumumab25\u201328. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab and tras + pert mediate antitumor activity through multiple MOAs but are incapable of eliciting CDC in HER2-expressing cells in the presence of human serum29\u201331. Engagement of the classical complement pathway is governed by a number of factors, including antigen size and density, that impact the ability of the antigen-Ab complex to assume a geometry that allows efficient C1q binding32. Optimal CDC activity requires hexameric organization of Ab Fc domains in the Ab-antigen clusters33. Among the CDC competent B-cell (CD20) targeting Abs, ofatumumab has been shown to have greater CDC activity compared to rituximab28,34, which may be due to the Abs\u2019 distinct membrane proximal epitope and CD20 binding kinetics that enables a geometry that facilitates greater C1q binding and complement activation27,34. Strategies that enhance CDC, including Ab hexamerization33,35 and Fc mutations36 have shown promise for enhancing antitumor activity in preclinical studies. For example, hexamerization was used to generate a B-cell targeting anti-CD37 biparatopic Ab with enhanced in vitro CDC activity37.We hypothesized that a biparatopic Ab engineered to enhance receptor crosslinking and clustering may provide the receptor-Ab organization required to bind C1q and engage this potent antitumor mechanism, and maintain and/or enhance all other measurable antitumor MOA ascribed to approved anti-HER2 Ab therapeutics.",
                "We present a comprehensive mechanistic evaluation of zanidatamab (previously referred to as ZW25), a humanized biparatopic IgG1-like Ab directed against ECD4 and ECD2 of HER2. We show that zanidatamab mediates antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo via multiple MOAs in HER2-expressing tumors, including increased tumor cell binding, HER2 internalization, suppression of cell signaling and tumor growth, as well as ADCC, and ADCP. Additionally, we show that zanidatamab elicits CDC in HER2-overexpressing cells, a functionality that is not observed with trastuzumab, pertuzumab or the combination tras + pert. We demonstrate that the geometry of zanidatamab binding and its ability to co-operatively engage adjacent HER2 molecules in trans, results in an improved capacity to cluster HER2 and has the ability to induce CDC."

The scFv and Fab arms of the original precursor biparatopic molecule bound to HER2 ECD with a KD of 1\u2009nM and 15\u2009nM, respectively, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using monovalent one-armed Ab (OAA) constructs (Supplementary Table\u00a01).Fig. 1Zanidatamab is a biparatopic anti-HER2 Ab that binds HER2-expressing tumor cells with greater Ab saturation than trastuzumab or pertuzumab.a Zanidatamab is a humanized, biparatopic, immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1)-like Ab with an scFv (light blue) that binds the juxtamembrane ECD4 of HER2 and a Fab (dark blue) that binds the ECD2 dimerization domain of HER2, the same domains targeted by trastuzumab and pertuzumab, respectively. b Representative class-averaged TEM image, derived from 216 images, showing the 3-lobed structure of zanidatamab with putative assignments of the scFv, Fab, and Fc region from a single experiment. c Zanidatamab binds with greater Ab saturation to tumor cell lines compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab.

                        "It has been previously reported that Ab combinations and biparatopic Abs can induce target antigen crosslinking, leading to increased receptor-driven internalization and receptor downregulation20\u201322. We hypothesized that our biparatopic Ab, which binds to two non-overlapping epitopes on HER2, would crosslink HER2 and that affinity enhancements to either the anti-HER2-ECD2 Fab or the anti-HER2-ECD4 scFv would further enhance HER2 crosslinking. Computational modeling revealed that increasing the affinity of the weaker anti-ECD2 Fab arm would have the highest impact on the crosslinking ability of the biparatopic Ab (Supplementary Results; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Based on these modeling results, we engineered a series of mutations into the lower affinity parental anti-ECD2 Fab using a structure guided approach and screened them as OAA to identify candidates with increased anti-HER2 binding affinity. One variant exhibited similar thermal stability as the parental Ab, as determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e), and importantly, had an 8.8-fold greater affinity with a KD of 1.7\u2009nM for binding the HER2 ECD2 (Supplementary Table\u00a01). This affinity-improved Fab was incorporated into the final anti-HER2 biparatopic Ab, zanidatamab. Zanidatamab bound human HER2 with subnanomolar apparent KD of 0.74\u2009nM, as determined by SPR (Supplementary Table\u00a02).",

Zanidatamab is mono-disperse in solution (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01g, h), and TEM imaging revealed that zanidatamab did not oligomerize or aggregate. Two-dimensional averaging of TEM images showed that zanidatamab appears to have the typical Ab \u201cY\u201d shape with 3 distinct lobes, one appearing like a dumbbell, another as a smaller lobe and the third as a ring, consistent with the Fab-scFv-Fc composition of zanidatamab (Fig.\u00a01a, b, Supplementary Results)."

                        "To understand the mechanism of our biparatopic Ab binding to HER2 ECD and gain information on the ability for cis and trans receptor binding (binding a single HER2 molecule vs. binding two distinct molecules, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a), we used SPR to assess the stoichiometry and kinetics of HER2 ECD binding. We compared the HER2 binding kinetics of zanidatamab, our anti-HER2 biparatopic precursor molecule (with the 8-fold lower affinity anti-ECD2 binding arm; zanidatamab precursor) and trastuzumab over increasing densities of immobilized Ab. The dissociation rate (koff) of HER2 ECD from trastuzumab would be independent of Ab density because of its obligate 1:1 binding mode; HER2 ECD is bound by trastuzumab only at ECD4 regardless of Ab concentration (Fig.\u00a02a cartoon, left). If the biparatopic zanidatamab binds to HER2 ECD in cis, its dissociation rate koff would also be expected to be independent of Ab density, as for trastuzumab, because of its 1:1 binding mode. If the biparatopic Ab binds to HER2 ECD in trans, its dissociation rate koff would be expected to decrease with increasing Ab density on the chip surface because HER2 ECD can be crosslinked by two molecules of zanidatamab through ECD2 and ECD4 at high Ab density, but not at very low Ab density (Fig.\u00a02a cartoon). SPR assay results showed the dissociation rate koff decreased with increasing density of captured zanidatamab and zanidatamab precursor, whereas the dissociation rate koff for trastuzumab remained constant at all surface densities tested (Fig.\u00a02a, right; Supplementary Table\u00a03). Additionally, a reduction in apparent KD (increased binding affinity) was observed as a consequence of koff decrease over increasing Ab capture concentrations with the zanidatamab and zanidatamab precursor but not with trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b, Supplementary Table\u00a03). These observations support the hypothesis that biparatopic antibodies such as zanidatamab can bind HER2 ECD in trans and that the frequency of trans-binding is increased at higher Ab concentrations.Fig. 2Zanidatamab binds HER2 in trans and forms large Ab:HER2 complexes in solution.a Cartoon depicts the SPR experimental set up to distinguish between cis and trans Ab:receptor binding. The dissociation constant koff for the monospecific anti-HER2 Ab control (left) is expected to be independent of Ab surface density; the same is expected for a biparatopic Ab binding in cis. For a biparatopic Ab binding in trans, crosslinking of receptor is expected to increase with increasing Ab chip densities (right), causing koff to decrease. Reduction in koff observed with increasing zanidatamab and zanidatamab precursor surface concentrations, but not for the control trastuzumab, shows ability of zanidatamab and zanidatamab precursor to bind HER2 in trans (right, see Supplementary Table\u00a03). Data from two independent experiments are shown. b AUC results for mixtures of HER2 ECD with anti-HER2 Abs at 1-, 2- and 5-fold HER2 excess. For reference, HER2 ECD and Abs were run separately and plotted with the HER2:Ab mixtures. For zanidatamab and tras + pert, higher order complexes were detected with increasing amounts when the excess of HER2 ECD was reduced. Tras or pert formed mainly 1:1 and 2:1 HER2:Ab complexes and only trace amounts of higher order complexes were detected. Complex compositions larger than 2:1 (HER2:Ab) are approximate. c Representative cryo-EM 2D class average, 3D reconstruction at 7.6\u2009\u00c5; resolution (middle) showing a core HER2 molecule bound to zanidatamab Fab and scFv, and a cartoon representation of the zanidatamab:HER2 complex observed by cryo-EM (right). The fuzzy halo observed in the 2D images is likely due to the Fc domain in multiple conformations. A model of HER2 (cyan) in complex with zanidatamab Fab (green) and scFv (blue) is also shown. The distance between the C-termini of the two antigen-binding domains cannot be spanned by a single zanidatamab molecule (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). Because this structural constraint prevents zanidatamab from binding to HER2 in cis, a single zanidatamab molecule can only bind in trans and crosslink two HER2 molecules by binding to the ECD2 on one and the ECD4 on another. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.",
                        "To determine the nature of complexes formed by zanidatamab and HER2 ECD in solution, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) with different mixed molar ratios of Ab and HER2 was employed. Zanidatamab (125\u2009kDa), trastuzumab (145\u2009kDa), pertuzumab (145\u2009kDa) or tras + pert (at 1:1 ratio) were mixed in solution phase with HER2 ECD (72\u2009kDa) at 1-, 2- and 5-fold molar excess and each component and mixtures were characterized by AUC in a sedimentation velocity experiment. The sedimentation coefficient S20, w of peaks in the AUC experiment correlates with molecular weight, while the area under the peaks in the normalized sedimentation coefficient distribution (c(s)) correlates with the relative amount of the species detected (Fig.\u00a02b). Zanidatamab formed 2:1 (HER2:Ab) and higher order multimeric complexes with HER2 ECD and only trace amounts of 1:1 complex. Multimeric complex formation for zanidatamab was observed even when HER2 ECD was in molar excess. With HER2 ECD in 5-fold molar excess, zanidatamab predominantly formed 2:1 complexes and a small amount of 2:2 complexes. When the molar excess of HER2 ECD relative to zanidatamab was decreased from 5-fold to 1-fold, the relative quantity of multimeric complexes increased to approximately 95% of the total peak area, presenting 2:2, 3:3 (or 2:3, 3:2) and 4:4 (or 4:3, 3:4) complexes. Complexes larger than 4:4 were detected at approximately 10% of the total peak area at equimolar concentration of HER2 ECD and zanidatamab. HER2 ECD mixed with tras + pert behaved similarly with increasing higher order multimeric complexes when the molar excess of HER2 was decreased, with some differences in the peak distribution. Trastuzumab or pertuzumab formed mainly 2:1 complexes when HER2 ECD was in excess, and only small quantities (<3% of the total peak area) of larger assemblies. At equimolar concentrations of HER2 with trastuzumab or pertuzumab, 1:1 complexes predominated, which is not the case for zanidatamab or tras + pert. Evidence for the formation of larger complexes in solution driven by anti-HER2 biparatopic molecules has been presented before17,19. Oganesyan et al.39 similarly employed AUC to demonstrate the formation of large biparatopic-driven HER2 complexes, which were not observed with the parental Ab.",
                        "We further examined zanidatamab in complex with HER2 ECD by cryo-EM. 2D class averaging revealed a core HER2 molecule bound to zanidatamab Fab and scFv (Fig.\u00a02c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). The diffuse background observed on the periphery of the images is likely formed by the multiple conformations of Fc and the second antigen-binding domain of the two Abs bound to the resolved HER2 ECD (Fig.\u00a02c, cartoon). Cryo-EM 3D reconstruction at 7.6\u2009\u00c5; resolution was used to fit the model of HER2 complexed with zanidatamab\u2019s Fab and scFv (Fig.\u00a02c). Our model reveals that the orientation and distance between the Fab and scFv domains cannot be bridged by a single zanidatamab hinge (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b) and must belong to two distinct zanidatamab molecules. Since HER2 ECD adopts a rigid conformation40 these structural constraints preclude zanidatamab from binding to HER2 in cis, as previously illustrated by Oh and Bang3. This further demonstrates that zanidatamab must bind HER2 in trans and crosslink two HER2 molecules by binding to the ECD2 on one and the ECD4 on another. Similar conclusions for the inability of a biparatopic Ab to bind in cis based on a crystal structure model have been previously presented by Oganesyan et al.39.",

                        "To determine whether HER2 crosslinking induced by the trans binding of zanidatamab translates into distinct clustering geometries of HER2 on the surface of tumor cells, we used confocal microscopy to image Ab-induced HER2 spatial organization (detected using the monovalent anti-HER2 ECD1-AF647 OAA) in high HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 cells (Fig.\u00a03). We used 3D spinning disk confocal microscopy to visualize the microscale organization of HER2 on randomly selected cells and to determine whether the different anti-HER2 Abs caused observable differences in HER2 organization or clustering. SK-BR-3 cells treated with the negative control Ab palivizumab (anti-RSV protein F), which does not bind HER2, exhibited a relatively uniform cell surface distribution of HER2 with occasional HER2 patches or microclusters (Fig.\u00a03b, c, d). In contrast, 3D reconstructions of cells that had been treated with zanidatamab, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert revealed Ab-induced reorganization and clustering of HER2 on the cell surface, with a significantly greater fraction of cells exhibiting distinct microclusters (Fig.\u00a03b\u2013d, Supplementary Movie\u00a01, Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).

These HER2 caps were readily distinguishable from smaller microclusters in both 3D reconstructed images (Supplementary Movie\u00a01) and in 2D confocal slices showing the plane of the cell with the greatest HER2 fluorescence (Fig.\u00a03c, d). The percent of zanidatamab-treated cells with HER2 caps increased from 5\u2009min to 15\u2009min but the HER2 caps were largely absent after 30\u2009min., although fluorescence polarized to one side of the cell was still observed. The HER2 caps were not observed with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or the tras + pert combinations (Fig.\u00a03c, d) at any time point tested. Pairwise comparisons using a binomial logistic regression model showed that only zanidatamab binding induced significant cap formation at the 5 and 15\u2009min (p\u2009<\u20090.001) time points in SK-BR-3 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c). The ability of zanidatamab to induce HER2 cap formation was confirmed in an additional HER2-expressing cell line (NCI-N87), with the level of HER2 caps formation facilitated by zanidatamab greater than that observed with trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Tras + pert also induced HER2 cap formation in NCI-N87 cells but to a lesser extent than zanidatamab (Supplementary Fig\u00a06d\u2013f). In summary, these data show that zanidatamab binding significantly induces distinct cell surface HER2 clustering, observed as a polarized \u2018HER2 cap\u2019, that is not observed with trastuzumab or pertuzumab."

                        "Having observed that zanidatamab binding induced significantly different microscale organization of HER2 on the cell surface, we hypothesized that zanidatamab would also induce distinct changes to HER2 clustering at the nanoscale level. To test this, we performed single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to determine the localization coordinates of HER2 molecules on the surface of Ab-treated SK-BR-3 cells. Quantitative analysis of HER2 clustering was performed using StormGraph41, a graph theory-based clustering algorithm.",
                        "SMLM and StormGraph analysis revealed that zanidatamab altered the local nanoscale clustering of HER2 to a greater extent than trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert (Fig.\u00a03e). Detection of HER2 on SK-BR-3 cells (with the anti-ECD1-AF647 Ab) following treatment with the negative control Ab, which does not bind HER2, showed many small HER2 clusters. In contrast, HER2 clusters on zanidatamab-treated cells were larger, with a corresponding decrease in the number of small HER2 clusters (Fig.\u00a03e). Importantly, zanidatamab treatment induced the formation of larger clusters, as well as a greater number of large clusters, than trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert.",
                        "To quantify these differences in HER2 clusters sizes, for each Ab treatment we generated graphs of cluster area versus the number of HER2 localizations per cluster (Fig.\u00a03f). In dSTORM, fluorescent molecules undergo multiple cycles of excitation and emission (i.e. blinking) such that a single fluorophore molecule yields multiple localizations42,43. Moreover, each molecule of the anti-HER2 ECD1-AF647 OAA detection reagent that we used was labeled with an average of 8-9 AF647 molecules. Hence, although they are related, it is difficult to determine the extent of \u2018overcounting\u2019, i.e., the number of dSTORM localizations per individual molecule. Mathematical approaches have been used to estimate the local degree of overcounting (described in44,45) but they often rely on multiple assumptions. Therefore, we report the experimentally determined number of HER2 localizations per cluster.",
                        "For each Ab treatment, we plotted the number of localizations per cluster versus cluster area for each cluster (>2900 clusters per condition) (Fig.\u00a03f). Note that there was a largely linear relationship between cluster area and the number of localizations per cluster for all Ab treatments (R2\u2009=\u20090.765\u20130.855) (Fig.\u00a03f). For all Ab treatments, 97\u201399% of the HER2 clusters detected (>2900 clusters per condition) contained fewer than 500 localizations (Fig.\u00a03f). Importantly, consistent with the dSTORM images in Fig.\u00a03e, SK-BR-3 cells treated with zanidatamab, and to a lesser extent trastuzumab, had a greater number of large clusters (Fig.\u00a03f). Relative to the control Ab, zanidatamab treatment increased the percent of clusters with >1500 localizations by 17.5-fold whereas trastuzumab caused an 8.2-fold increase while pertuzumab and tras + pert caused much smaller increases in the frequency of these large clusters (Fig.\u00a03g).",
                        "To analyze the local effects of the different Ab treatments on HER2 clustering, we calculated the mean cluster area for all of the clusters within each 2\u2009\u00b5m \u00d7 2\u2009\u00b5m region of interest (ROI) that we imaged for each Ab treatment (55-124 ROIs from multiple cells) and then compared the distribution of these values (Fig.\u00a03h). On SK-BR-3 cells treated with the negative control Ab, HER2 localizations were present mainly in small clusters (Fig.\u00a03e, f) and the ROI mean cluster areas ranged from 2055\u20134061 nm2 (geometric mean: 2921 nm2) (Fig.\u00a03h). The mean cluster areas for the ROIs on pertuzumab-treated cells ranged from 1699\u20135075 nm2 with a geometric mean of 2835 nm2, similar to that of control Ab-treated cells. Trastuzumab treatment increased this geometric mean value to 4052 nm2, with the 2009\u20138846 nm2 range of cluster areas reflecting a modest increase in the frequency of ROIs with larger mean cluster areas. Interestingly, the ROI mean cluster areas (1641\u20136425 nm2 range) observed after tras + pert treatment had a geometric mean of 3343 nm2, which was intermediate in size between the geometric mean values for either trastuzumab or pertuzumab alone. Zanidatamab treatment caused the largest increase in ROI mean cluster area with a resulting geometric mean of 4919 nm2 and a range of 2343\u201343,915 nm2. Pairwise comparisons of the means confirmed that zanidatamab significantly increased the ROI mean HER2 cluster area compared to trastuzumab (p\u2009=\u20090.005), pertuzumab or tras + pert (p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03h). Moreover, only zanidatamab treatment resulted in ROIs with mean cluster areas >10,000 nm2. These data indicate that zanidatamab induced the formation of large HER2 clusters in many ROIs and did so to a significantly greater extent than trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert."

                        "Next, we asked whether the increased saturation and HER2 clustering observed with zanidatamab would translate into higher Fc-effector function activity, such as CDC, compared to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert. We selected a panel of high HER2-expressing (HER2 3+) cell lines (Table\u00a01) derived from breast (BT-474, SK-BR-3, ZR-75-30, AU565, HCC1419), gastric (NCI-N87), esophageal (OE-19), and lung (NCI-H2170) tumors, and evaluated CDC by measuring cell viability following Ab treatment in the presence of normal human serum (NHS) as a complement source. For all high HER2-expressing cell lines, zanidatamab-mediated concentration-dependent CDC with mean IC50 values ranging from 7 to 13\u2009nM and induced approximately 40 to 95% cell death (i.e. decreased the percent of viable cells ranging from 4 to 60%) (Fig.\u00a04a, Table\u00a01). Tras + pert mediated weak CDC in NCI-N87 cells at the highest antibody concentrations tested, and to a much lower extent than zanidatamab, but did not induce CDC-mediated cell death in any other HER2-expressing cancer cell lines (Table\u00a01, Fig.\u00a04a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a07f, g). To verify that the antitumor activity observed was CDC-dependent, the complement cascade components in NHS were heat inactivated or tested in the presence of EDTA (NHS\u2009+\u20090.01\u2009M EDTA). CDC was not observed with the heat-inactivated NHS, or with NHS\u2009+\u20090.05\u2009M EDTA for any of the Abs tested (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a, h, i). We then evaluated CDC activity in four low-HER2-expressing cancer cell lines including JIMT-1, ZR-75-1, MCF7, and MDA-MB-175-VII and did not observe CDC with any anti-HER2 Abs including zanidatamab (Supplementary Table\u00a04). CDC was not observed for trastuzumab or pertuzumab in any of the cell lines tested (Table\u00a01, Supplementary Table\u00a04). We further evaluated CDC activity by adding NHS to the tumor cells (5\u2009min, 37\u00b0C), followed by antibody treatment and observed similar activity where only zanidatamab elicited CDC in all cell lines tested (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig.\u00a07f, g). Thus, zanidatamab uniquely supported substantial CDC in multiple high HER2-expressing cancer cell lines but not in the limited number of low-HER2-expressing cancer cell lines that were evaluated.Table 1Percent complement-dependent cytotoxicity at maximal effect values of anti-HER2 Abs in HER2 expressing cancer cell linesCell lineCancer typeHER2 IHC overall scoreaAverage HER2 receptors/cellbPercent of viable cells remaining following treatment at maximal effect (95% CI)cZanidatamabTrastuzumabPertuzumabTras\u2009+\u2009pertNegative controlHCC1954Breast3+7.03\u2009\u00d7\u200910649.8 (46, 54)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveHCC1419Breast3+6.58\u2009\u00d7\u20091066.18 (2.3, 10)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveZR-75-30Breast3+5.36\u2009\u00d7\u20091064.07 (1.7, 6.4)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveAU565Breast3+4.54\u2009\u00d7\u200910634.3 (28, 40)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveNCI-H2170Lung3+4.40\u2009\u00d7\u200910620.6 (16, 26)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveOE-19Esophageal3+3.44\u2009\u00d7\u200910624.6 (21, 28)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveBT-474Breast3+3.43\u2009\u00d7\u20091069.45 (4.2, 15)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveSK-BR-3Breast3+3.40\u2009\u00d7\u200910659.7 (56, 64)InactiveInactiveInactiveInactiveNCI-N87Gastric3+2.67\u2009\u00d7\u200910610.7 (6.4, 15)InactiveInactive76.6 (48, 110)Inactive95% CI 95% confidence interval.aHER2 expression by IHC was determined with HercepTest (Dako, Carpinteria, California).

                        "To elucidate the basis for the enhanced ability of zanidatamab to induce CDC, we analyzed early steps of complement engagement and classical pathway activation. We used flow cytometry to assess the deposition of C1q, the first component of the complement cascade, and C3 fragments (C3b/iC3b/C3dg), subsequent cascade components upstream of the membrane attack complex formation, on a representative HER2 3+ cell line, NCI-N87, following Ab binding in the presence of NHS. Zanidatamab mediated the highest deposition of C1q and C3 fragments of all anti-HER2 Ab treatments examined (Fig.\u00a04b). Zanidatamab and tras + pert mediated concentration-dependent C1q deposition, whereas no C1q deposition was detected with trastuzumab or pertuzumab. Zanidatamab and tras + pert mediated concentration-dependent C3 fragment deposition, whereas trastuzumab and pertuzumab showed weak C3 fragment deposition on NCI-N87 cells. Compared to tras + pert, zanidatamab demonstrated 1.4 and 6.5-fold higher maximum geometric MFI of C1q and C3 fragments including C3b/iC3b and C3dg, respectively. We further compared C3b/iC3b/C3dg and C3b/iC3b deposition on SK-BR-3 cells in the presence of NHS. As observed in NCI-N87 cells, zanidatamab mediated the highest C3b/iC3b/C3dg or C3b/iC3b deposition compared to tras + pert, whereas trastuzumab or pertuzumab mediated no C3 fragment deposition.

Under all conditions tested with NHS, zanidatamab elicited CDC activity (Supplementary Results, Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c\u2013e). Together, these data establish CDC as a rapid and consistently differentiating cytotoxic mechanism of action of zanidatamab, which is not observed with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert."

In summary, zanidatamab treatment reduced total HER2, pHER3, and pAKT levels in HER2-expressing SK-BR-3 and JIMT-1 breast cancer cells, and reduced HER2, pHER2, pHER3 pEGFR, pAKT and pERK in NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells."

Ligand-mediated HER2-heterodimer formation (e.g. HER2-EGFR) drives compensatory signaling and proliferation and is believed to play a role in driving trastuzumab resistance47. We first identified cell lines, media conditions and ligand concentrations in which EGF-mediated growth proliferation was observed (Supplementary Table\u00a08). Under the conditions identified, addition of EGF resulted in a 12% to 86% increase in cell proliferation compared to non-ligand treated BT-474, NCI-H2170, NCI-N87, OE-19, and ZR-75-30 cells (Supplementary Table\u00a08). Importantly, zanidatamab mediated a significant concentration-dependent reduction of viability compared to the EGF-treated control in all cell lines tested (Fig.\u00a06b, Supplementary Tables\u00a08 and 9). Zanidatamab mediated significantly greater EGF-driven growth inhibition than trastuzumab or pertuzumab in all 5 cell lines and compared to tras + pert in NCI-H2170 cells.

                "Targeting HER2 has improved outcomes in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast and gastric/GEJ cancers. However, because the cancers in these patients ultimately progress, there remains a need for anti-HER2 therapies with greater efficacy and differentiated MOAs3. To address limitations of the current standard of care, we engineered a biparatopic anti-HER2 Ab, zanidatamab, a human IgG1-like bispecific Ab that recognizes two non-overlapping epitopes (ECD2 and ECD4) and promotes receptor crosslinking. Here, we demonstrated that zanidatamab has unique and enhanced functionalities compared to regulatory approved anti-HER2 monoclonal Abs trastuzumab and pertuzumab. We show that zanidatamab binds HER2 in trans and forms distinct and large cell surface HER2 clusters. We hypothesized that zanidatamab\u2019s distinct Ab:HER2 crosslinking leads to potent CDC, an activity that is not observed for trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert. Zanidatamab also mediated HER2 internalization and downregulation, inhibition of cell signaling and tumor growth, as well as ADCC, and ADCP. When translated to an in vivo model, zanidatamab showed superior in vivo antitumor activity compared to trastuzumab and tras + pert in HER2-expressing xenograft models.",
                "Biparatopic Abs have been shown to bind tumor cells with increased saturation compared to canonical monospecific Abs15 and induce receptor crosslinking20\u201322 leading to cell intrinsic effects including receptor internalization and downregulation, decreased receptor signaling, and growth inhibition. We hypothesized that the biparatopic Ab zanidatamab would increase Ab saturation compared to trastuzumab or pertuzumab and form distinct receptor clusters on HER2-expressing tumor cells that could additionally promote cell extrinsic effects of Fc-mediated cytotoxicity, including CDC.",
                "Evaluation of cell surface binding to HER2-expressing cancer cells by flow cytometry showed that zanidatamab had 1.3 to 1.6-fold higher maximum binding capacity (saturation) compared to the monospecific Abs trastuzumab or pertuzumab. The SPR experiment and cryo-EM-derived model demonstrated the mechanism of HER2 engagement and showed that zanidatamab binds HER2 ECD in trans. The trans binding of zanidatamab led to the formation of large crosslinked HER2:zanidatamab complexes, or clusters, both in solution as observed by AUC and on-cell surfaces as shown by microscopy experiments. Overall, the formation of clusters, driven by trans receptor binding and crosslinking, can be seen as one of the defining characteristics of biparatopic Abs\u00a0such as zanidatamab.",
                "Using dSTORM, we showed that treatment of HER2-expressing breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3) with zanidatamab induced the formation of large HER2 clusters to a much greater extent than trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tras + pert treatment. This contrasts with the AUC data, where both zanidatamab and tras + pert promote similarly large oligomers in solution. We believe that the clustering observed by AUC with free HER2 ECD in solution is not fully representative of the binding constraints imposed by HER2 molecules in the cell membrane. Moreover, HER2 is expected to be present as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with other HER receptor family members on the cell surface48, which is not represented in the AUC study in a homogenous HER2 environment.",
                "The distinct clustering properties of zanidatamab were also observed on a macroscopic level. Zanidatamab promoted the formation of large, polarized clusters of HER2, or caps, a unique property of this biparatopic Ab that was not recapitulated by tras + pert or either Ab alone (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d). This capping, which was observed at 5 and 15\u2009min following zanidatamab addition to the cells, likely reflects a redistribution of cell surface HER2 into a highly crosslinked receptor aggregate that polarizes to one side of the cell. We hypothesize that the cap structure is a consequence of the nanoscale changes in HER2 organization that were observed by dSTORM.",
                "The absence of HER2 caps at 30\u2009min after zanidatamab addition may be a consequence of the kinetics of receptor internalization following Ab binding. Indeed, we observed zanidatamab internalization as early as 15\u2009min after addition to SK-BR3 cells (Fig.\u00a05a). To our knowledge, we are the first to report the observations of Ab-induced HER2 capping on tumor cells.",
                "Hexameric organization of Ab Fc regions in the Ab-antigen clusters has been shown to be required for optimal CDC activity33. Because we had observed that zanidatamab binding induced large cell surface HER2 clusters, we asked whether the oligomeric Fc organization of zanidatamab on the cell surface could facilitate hexamerization and enable complement binding and activation. Indeed, evaluation of CDC in a panel of HER2-expressing cell lines showed that zanidatamab mediated potent antitumor activity in all high HER2-expressing (HER2 3+) cell lines tested. The uniqueness of the zanidatamab-induced HER2 clusters is apparent in the dSTORM imaging (Fig.\u00a03e) and in confocal microscopy (Fig.\u00a03d). Our data suggests that the disappearance of HER2 caps at 30\u2009min in the confocal microscopy does not impact CDC activity since zanidatamab pre-incubation with SK-BR-3 and NCI-N87 cells from 30\u2009min to 1\u2009h did not result in lower CDC activity than was observed for earlier time points. In fact, CDC potency increased with longer duration of zanidatamab:tumor cell pre-incubation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c). Increasing the percent of NHS to 80% showed increased CDC with zanidatamab, whereas all other anti-HER2 treatments remained inactive (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d). Our data suggests that zanidatamab-induced HER2 clusters facilitate a distinct organization of cell surface HER2, and thus a distinctive organization of zanidatamab Fc, that meets the hexameric Fc requirements needed to promote CDC activity. Furthermore, our modeling suggests that zanidatamab bound to HER2 is capable of forming a hexamer (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010) and provides a rationale for why HER2 clustering by zanidatamab appears to provide high avidity docking sites for C1q binding. Additionally, zanidatamab elicited rapid CDC as early as 5\u2009min post serum addition in NCI-N87 and SK-BR-3 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07e), a timescale consistent with large HER2 cluster formation observed in the dSTORM (15\u2009min) and confocal (HER2 caps at 5 and 15\u2009min) data.",
                "Unlike zanidatamab, tras + pert, trastuzumab, or pertuzumab did not mediate formation of HER2 caps, large HER2 clusters, or CDC. In particular, the cluster sizes formed by tras + pert treatment were not larger than those seen with trastuzumab alone. Despite the on-cell flow cytometry binding data that showed both zanidatamab and tras + pert binding with equivalent Ab densities, the tras + pert cluster profiles observed by dSTORM show differences in HER2 engagement among these treatments. Based on the tras + pert cluster profiles observed, it appears that the two antibodies may engage the HER2 receptors independently. Interestingly, the only cell line in which tras + pert elicited weak CDC (NCI-N87), also showed a modest increase in HER2 caps formation following tras + pert binding. While we and others46 have shown CDC activity with tras + pert in the presence of rabbit complement serum, it is important to note that tras + pert was inactive in the presence of human complement (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b, Fig.\u00a04). Due to the capacity of rabbit serum to mediate high background CDC activity compared to human serum (as a result of functional pathway differences, including ability to lyse target cells without substantial C3 deposition49 and lack of cross-reactivity to, and inhibition by, human complement regulatory proteins50), caution should be taken when drawing conclusions about CDC results using rabbit serum. Overall, the distinct and large HER2 cluster formation we observed with zanidatamab correlated with its CDC activity. We propose that these large HER2 clusters may be sites where a high local density of C1q or Fc receptor binding interactions enables complement-mediated and cellular responses.",
                "The observations we present with zanidatamab, including Ab-induced target receptor capping and clustering, and CDC in tumor cells with high target expression, parallels the observations of approved type I anti-CD20 Abs, such as rituximab. Rituximab binding has been shown to induce CD20 capping on the B-cell surface51 and CD20 clustering leading to stronger C1q binding and activation of CDC52 in tumor cells with high CD20 expression levels53. Moreover, the formation of receptor caps following rituximab binding to CD20 was associated with increased target killing by ADCC51. Rituximab has several mechanisms of action, including ADCC and CDC54,55. It has been proposed that ADCC and CDC may act cooperatively in heterogeneous tumor cell populations, for example, where complement eradicates cells with high CD20 expression and ADCC eliminates cells with low CD20 expression56. We hypothesize that the reasons for the observed differences in CDC with zanidatamab in high vs. low-HER2-expressing cell lines may be a function of the HER2 density required for large cluster formation and subsequent C1q engagement, as well as the relative levels of HER2 compared to complement regulatory protein (CD46, CD55, CD59) that inhibit CDC57. This requires further investigation and confirmation.",
                "Obligate bispecific Abs, possessing unique functional activities that are not recapitulated by a combination of Abs, represent an emerging approach in antitumor therapy23. Distinct clustering properties and potent CDC activity define zanidatamab as an obligate biparatopic Ab since these activities are not recapitulated by tras + pert. To our knowledge, we describe the first example of an obligate biparatopic Ab. Beyond CDC, zanidatamab also promotes a multitude of other antitumor activities that are present in a range of HER2 expressing cells, as summarized in Fig.\u00a08.Fig. 8Zanidatamab has multiple mechanisms of action.We hypothesize that the trans biparatopic HER2 binding properties of zanidatamab forms the foundation of its multiple mechanisms of action. Zanidatamab binding leads to approximately 1.5-fold increased cell surface Ab saturation as well as to receptor crosslinking. The large cell surface HER2 clusters mediated by zanidatamab engagement facilitate C1q binding, likely by promoting hexamerization, and elicit potent CDC in HER2-high cell lines. In all HER2-expressing cells, including HER2-low tumors, ADCC and ADCP activities were also observed. It is also likely that receptor crosslinking and clustering prevent HER2 homodimerization and heterodimerization with other signaling partners, leading to the ligand-independent and ligand-dependent signal inhibition observed. Additionally, large receptor clusters are not efficiently recycled from early endosomes, culminating in increased receptor internalization and degradation. Together, these mechanisms contribute to the overall effect of tumor cell death and growth inhibition of zanidatamab in vitro and in vivo.",
                "We hypothesize that the trans biparatopic HER2 binding properties of zanidatamab, which result in increased cell surface Ab saturation, HER2 crosslinking, and the formation of distinctive and large receptor clusters, form the foundation for the diverse MOA observed for this Ab. Extracellularly, these properties lead to ADCC and ADCP activities, and a robust CDC activity that is unique to zanidatamab, compared to trastuzumab, pertuzumab and tras + pert. Zanidatamab-driven crosslinking and clustering likely contribute, at least in part, to ligand-independent and ligand-dependent signal inhibition by preventing HER2 homodimerization and heterodimerization with other signaling partners, a phenomenon previously described for a DARPin biparatopic molecule18. Crosslinking impacts the recycling of HER2:zanidatamab complexes, leading to increased receptor internalization and degradation21 which, combined with direct inhibition of HER2 signaling pathways, promotes inhibition of growth of HER2-expressing cancer cells. There is likely an interplay among these mechanisms; for example, the opportunity for rapid Fc-mediated effector functions and intracellular mechanisms that together contribute to the overall effect of tumor cell death and growth inhibition. An antitumor framework could exist in zanidatamab-treated tumors, where certain mechanisms predominate in high HER2-expressing tumors and other mechanisms in HER2-low tumors; however, this requires further investigation.",
                "Zanidatamab\u2019s functionalities observed in vitro translate into potent tumor growth inhibition in HER2-expressing gastric cancer xenografts in vivo. In the PDX model GXA 3054, treatment with zanidatamab-induced tumor regression, whereas treatment with trastuzumab did not. In the CDX model NCI-N87, zanidatamab mediated significantly greater antitumor activity compared to trastuzumab or tras + pert, consistent with the in vitro observations, where zanidatamab also showed significantly greater growth inhibition compared to trastuzumab and tras + pert in NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells. Zanidatamab also showed significantly greater in vitro ligand-independent and EGF-driven growth inhibition compared to trastuzumab and tras + pert in cell lines including esophageal, gastric, lung, and breast cancer.\u00a0(Fig. 6, Supplementary Tables 7, 9) Moreover, cell intrinsic antitumor MOAs including HER2 downregulation, internalization, and pHER3 and pAKT inhibition likely contribute to the antitumor activity observed with zanidatamab in vitro and in vivo. Because mouse models have impaired complement activity compared to human and other mammals58,59, the ability of zanidatamab treatment to cause significant regression in the PDX model suggests that the other antitumor mechanisms contribute significantly to the overall effect observed. Our data corroborates the impaired CDC activity with mouse serum reported by others, and zanidatamab did not elicit CDC activity in the high HER2-expressing NCI-N87 with mouse serum (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07f). These data highlight the translational challenges in using mouse models, as they may underestimate antitumor activity driven by CDC. Given those limitations, the relative therapeutic contributions of each of the described mechanisms to zanidatamab\u2019s antitumor activity in vivo are yet to be determined and are currently being evaluated clinically. While findings in rodent models do not always translate to clinical outcomes, the strong antitumor activity of zanidatamab in our PDX model along with its potency in vitro suggests that zanidatamab will function in the clinical setting.",
                "Data from the ongoing phase 1 study (NCT02892123) demonstrate that zanidatamab is well tolerated and has single agent activity in patients with advanced HER2-expressing cancers, including breast, gastric, and biliary tract cancers, that have progressed after standard of care therapies, including administration of HER2-targeted agents such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM160,61. The preclinical data presented herein supports mechanisms of action for the clinical antitumor activity observed with zanidatamab as monotherapy and the potential differentiation of zanidatamab from trastuzumab and tras + pert, which are part of the current standards of care for HER2-positive gastric and breast cancers, respectively. Zanidatamab is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in multiple HER2 overexpressing solid tumors, including a registration-enabling clinical trial in HER2 gene amplified biliary tract cancer (NCT04466891).",
                "In summary, zanidatamab is a biparatopic anti-HER2 Ab with unique and enhanced functionalities compared to trastuzumab, pertuzumab and tras + pert. The strong antitumor activity observed in vivo and in vitro suggests that zanidatamab will show activity in the clinical setting, and perhaps even with greater efficacy than the current anti-HER2 therapies and in indications outside of breast and gastric cancer."

At each capture level, this was followed by HER2 ECD injections between 3.75 and 60\u2009nM over a blank reference and the captured antibody surfaces to generate the binding sensograms. A flow rate of 100 \u03bcL/min was used for the HER2 injections to minimize mass transport, with a 200\u2009s association and a long 2000 s dissociation for off-rate determination of the high affinity interactions.

All studies were repeated at least three times, except for the TEM, AUC and in vivo studies and in few cases noted in supplementary data tables. Meta-analysis on experimental replicate data was performed for CDC, receptor depletion and ligand-independent growth inhibition. The mean estimate from n experiments for the meta-analysis was calculated as follows, where xi is the maximal effect in the ith experiment:\\(\\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i}^{n}x_{i}\\) The mean standard error for the meta-analysis was calculated with the following formula, where \u03c3i is the standard deviation in the ith experiment:\\(\\overline{SE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i}^{n}\\frac{\\sigma_{i}}{\\sqrt{n_{i}}}\\) The 95% confidence interval was calculated assuming the mean follows a Normal distribution using:\\(\\overline{x} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\overline{SE}\\)"
