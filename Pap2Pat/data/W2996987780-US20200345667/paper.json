    "abstract": "Spermatogonia, which produce sperm throughout the male lifetime, are regulated inside a niche composed of Sertoli cells, and other testis cell types. Defects in Sertoli cells often lead to infertility, but replacement of defective cells has been limited by the inability to deplete the existing population. Here, we use an FDA-approved non-toxic drug, benzalkonium chloride (BC), to deplete testis cell types in vivo. Four days after BC administration, Sertoli cells are preferentially depleted, and can be replaced to promote spermatogenesis from surviving (host) spermatogonia. Seven days after BC treatment, multiple cell types can be engrafted from fresh or cryopreserved testicular cells, leading to complete spermatogenesis from donor cells. These methods will be valuable for investigation of niche-supporting cell interactions, have the potential to lead to a therapy for idiopathic male infertility in the clinic, and could open the door to production of sperm from other species in the mouse.",

                "The efficient production of sperm from spermatogonia requires the coordinated interplay between germ cells and various somatic support cells making up the spermatogenic niche. Approximately 1:100 adult males is azoospermic, and in ~40% of these cases the defect is idiopathic and may lie with the germ cell itself or any of the somatic cell types making up the spermatogenic niche. Of these cell types, Sertoli cells reside within the testis tubules attached to the same basal lamina as the spermatogonia, while Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and macrophages lie immediately outside the tubules in the supporting stroma. Since the Sertoli cells interact directly with germ cells and are vital to provide morphological and nutritional support for spermatogenesis, their dysfunction is often the cause of spermatogenic failure1\u20135.",
                "To compensate for Sertoli cell dysfunction, several therapeutic approaches have been investigated, such as transplantation of healthy Sertoli cells6, supplementation of missing growth factors by viral transduction7\u201310, or explant and culture of testis tissue in vitro11. Although researchers showed evidence that offspring did not carry the transgene7\u201310, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of viral transmission to the next generation, and no human testis culture system has yet been established. Since auto-transplantation of testicular cells from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients was reported12,13, Sertoli cell transplantation has been a possible approach for the clinic. However, long-term success depends upon sufficient space being made available along the basal lamina for repopulation of the tubules by donor Sertoli cells. For in vivo feasibility studies, some groups have used transgenic mouse models expressing cytotoxic genes or specific toxin receptors to eliminate Sertoli cells prior to transplantation14. However, since these approaches require genetic manipulations, they are not suitable for clinical studies. Other studies used cadmium injection into the testis to deplete Sertoli cells, but cadmium administration has many adverse side effects and could not be used in the clinic15.",
                "Here, we demonstrate the use of a well-described FDA-approved nontoxic drug, benzalkonium chloride (BC), to remove host Sertoli cells and enable cell transplantation into the testis in vivo. BC is a quaternary ammonium that acts as a detergent to disrupt the lipid membrane of cells. Originally developed as a germicide to kill microorganisms, it was first used in the ophthalmic industry in the 1940s as a preservative in hard contact lens solutions.",
                "We show that treatment of the testis with BC leads to rapid depletion of Sertoli cells. We describe two windows of opportunity for engraftment of various testis cell types after BC injection into the rete testis. Within 4 days of administration, BC preferentially depletes only Sertoli cells, leaving a scaffold into which healthy, isolated Sertoli cells can be engrafted to allow rescue of spermatogenesis from surviving (host) spermatogonia. At later times after BC treatment, some germ cell and stromal support cell types are also lost, most likely secondary to the loss of the trophic support of Sertoli cells. Significantly, these cells can be replaced by engraftment of fresh or cryopreserved testicular cells, leading to recovery of spermatogenesis from donor cells.",
                "We show that the effects of BC extend to a large animal model (canine). As BC is a common component of eye drops, we anticipate that our Sertoli/niche cell ablation method could be safely adapted for the clinic to overcome the weaknesses of previous approaches. We anticipate that this method could be used to rescue host fertility, and possibly to produce xenogeneic sperm in mouse. This approach will also open up opportunities for in vivo studies of niche cell interactions and function."

                        "In our initial experiments, we incubated a whole neonatal mouse testis in 0.02% BC solution for 10\u2009min and, after thorough washing, cultured the organ for 4 days at the surface/air interface in wells atop an agarose block (Fig.\u00a01a). The testis was then fixed and stained for whole-mount immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody against the Sertoli cell marker SOX9 (Sry-box 9). In this assay, SOX9\u2009+\u2009Sertoli cells were depleted throughout the testis (Fig.\u00a01b, c). Neonatal testes incubated in PBS, 0.02% or 0.03% BC were sectioned, and Sertoli and other cell types were counted (Fig.\u00a01; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a\u2013l). A solution of 0.02% BC completely eliminated Sertoli cells in 82% of the tubule cross-sections analyzed (719/873 tubule sections, n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes), while fewer Sertoli cells were left in the remainder (952 cells/154 tubule sections; ~6 cells/tubule section; n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) compared with control (3070 cells/115 tubule sections; ~27 cells/tubule section; n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) (P\u2009=\u20090.029).

                        "We performed H&E staining on samples treated with 0.02% BC to confirm that Sertoli cells (and not only SOX9 protein) were lost. These assays showed that by day 3, there was a severe depletion of Sertoli cell nuclei along the basal lamina of seminiferous cords (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a, b). Apoptotic cell death increased from day 2 to day 4 based on staining with cleaved caspase 3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c, d). Loss of SOX9\u2009+\u2009cells (Fig.\u00a01b, c) was associated with elevated numbers of F4/80\u2009+\u2009macrophages. However, despite the severe depletion of Sertoli cells based on both histology and SOX9 staining, the normal distribution of Laminin (LMN) showed that the structure of the seminiferous tubule was well maintained (Fig.\u00a01d, e). Importantly, other cell types in the testis, 3\u03b2HSD (3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)-positive Leydig cells (Fig.\u00a01f, g) were spared. Immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle actin, alpha (\u03b1SMA) suggested that PMCs were intact (Fig.\u00a01h, i), and antibody staining with both the germ-cell-specific monoclonal antibody (TRA98)16 and GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFR\u03b11) revealed that some germ cells remained along the basement membrane in Sertoli-ablated tubules (Fig.\u00a01, j\u2013m). Testes treated with 0.02% or 0.03% BC were sectioned, and the number of germ cells per tubule cross-section was counted. In samples treated with 0.02% BC, germ cell numbers were significantly reduced (~4 cells/tubule cross-section in a total of 968 cross-sections analyzed; n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) compared with controls (~9 cells/tubules cross-section in a total of 340 tubules counted; n\u2009=\u20094 testes) (P\u2009=\u20090.029) (Fig.\u00a01n), likely a secondary effect of Sertoli cell depletion. However, the numbers of PMCs and Leydig cells outside the tubules were not affected: 1303 PMCs/125 tubule cross-sections in treated testis (n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) versus 963 cells/101 tubule cross-sections in control testis (n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes); and 3253 Leydig cells/873 tubules in treated testis (n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) versus 1883 cells/541 tubules in control testis (n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) (Fig.\u00a01n). Although incubation of the neonatal testis with 0.03% BC led to a more severe loss of Sertoli cells, it also caused disruption of cord structure and loss of germ cells, PMCs, and Leydig cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e, f)."

H&E staining and immunohistochemistry showed that many Sertoli cell nuclei disappear by day 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a\u2013d). This result was confirmed by loss of SOX9\u2009+\u2009Sertoli cells from 27% of the tubule cross-sections analyzed (248/908, n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes) (Fig.\u00a02b\u2013l). In 6% of the tubule cross-sections (59/908, n\u2009=\u20094 testes), fewer Sertoli cells remained (an average of 6 Sertoli cells/tubule cross-section compared with an average of 28 Sertoli cells/tubule cross-section in testes injected with PBS) (P\u2009=\u20090.029). Analysis of affected testis tubules on day 3 showed defects in the differentiating germ cell layer, with many irregularly condensed nuclei (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e, f). Cleaved Caspase 3\u2009+\u2009cells were rarely seen on day 3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e), but some cells, presumably spermatocytes, were positive for Caspase 3 on day 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03g). There was evidence for accumulation of F4/80 macrophages around the tubules, including invasion into the lumen of some tubules on day 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03h). These macrophages may have scavenged dying Sertoli cells and spermatocytes. In summary, on day 3, testes injected with BC showed the onset of cell degeneration within tubules. However, cell loss and inflammation were not observed until day 4.Fig. 2Four days after BC treatment in vivo, only Sertoli and germ cells were severely depleted.a Schematic representation of experimental procedures for in vivo adult Sertoli cell ablation. b\u2013k Sox9-ECFP adult mouse testis 4 days after PBS or BC injection into seminiferous tubules.

                        "Immunohistochemistry for \u03b1SMA suggested that PMC morphology was intact (Fig.\u00a02c, d), and Laminin staining also showed an intact basal lamina surrounding affected tubules (Fig.\u00a02e). Antibodies against 3\u03b2HSD and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) revealed that Leydig cells and endothelial cells were not obviously affected (Fig.\u00a02f, g). Although loss of Sertoli cells resulted in the rapid loss of differentiating germ cells (Fig.\u00a02h), some surviving spermatogonia were present along the basal lamina in drug-affected tubules based on staining with antibodies against STRA8 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene) (Fig.\u00a02i), HuC/D (human HuC/HuD neuronal protein) and C-KIT (Fig.\u00a02j, k; Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, b). To quantify the effect of BC on other cell types in adult testis in vivo, the number of HuC/D\u2009+\u2009spermatogonia, Leydig cells, or PMCs per cross-section of BC-affected seminiferous tubules was counted (n\u2009=\u20094 independent testes). On day 4, the number of spermatogonia (positive for the spermatogonial marker, HuC/D) per tubule cross-section was decreased in drug-treated testes (P\u2009=\u20090.029). However, the numbers of Leydig cells and PMCs were similar to controls (Fig.\u00a02l). In summary, 4 days after 0.02% BC treatment, Sertoli cells were significantly depleted, but the interstitial compartment, testis cord structure, and some spermatogonia were still present, and there was no evidence of an effect on the behavior or viability of the treated animals."

A highly colonized region of a testis isolated 59 days posttransplantation is shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a, b.

Seven days after BC treatment of wild-type host mice, cryopreserved donor testicular cells were thawed and introduced into the rete testis. The results were similar to the results using freshly prepared cells for transplantation. Seventy-one days after transplantation, we found that cryopreserved Sertoli cells and spermatogonia had colonized testis tubules and donor supporting cells, presumably Leydig cells and PMCs, were found in the interstitium (Fig.\u00a06, a\u2013d; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08c, d). In some tubules, cryopreserved Sertoli cells supported host spermatogenesis (Fig.\u00a06b), and in other tubules, cryopreserved donor Sertoli cells colonized with donor spermatogonia and supported donor spermatogenesis (Fig.\u00a06c, d). In 3/3 host testes, cryopreserved Sertoli cells and spermatogonia colonized the tubules, and advanced spermatogenesis from donor cells was observed in two of these hosts.Fig. 6Cryopreserved donor testicular cells injected 7 days post-BC treatment reconstitute multiple cell types in the testis.a Schematic representation of experimental procedures for cryopreserved testicular cell transplantation 7 days after BC treatment. b\u2013d Host testis 71 days after transplantation of 9 dpp CAG-EGFP testicular cells that had been cryopreserved for 39 days.

                "Defects in Sertoli cells and other somatic cell types that form the spermatogonial niche in the testis are responsible for many cases of infertility2\u20134, but efforts to replace defective Sertoli cells in vivo have been hampered by the inability to achieve engraftment in competition with resident cells14. Ablation of Sertoli cells was previously reported using diphtheria toxin receptor-mediated conditional and targeted cell ablation systems14,17,18. However, while these methods have significantly advanced our knowledge of testis biology, they are not feasible in the clinic.",
                "We have devised a technique to deplete Sertoli cells using a nontoxic agent, benzalkonium chloride. BC was previously reported to remove mouse and rat enteric nerve plexi when the GI tract was treated in vitro19\u201325. In this study, 0.02% BC injection into the rete testis caused no discernable side effects in the mouse, but did cause severe Sertoli cell depletion and partial depletion of spermatogonia and differentiating sperm. BC is a cationic surfactant that works preferentially on cells with a strong negative membrane charge26, raising the possibility that the Sertoli cell membrane might have a more negative charge than other cell types in the testis. Future experiments will be designed to address the mechanism of BC action. We hypothesize that the most depleted tubules were those most closely connected to the rete site of injection. We show that the effect of incubation with BC is similar in canine testes, which suggests that the treatment can be used in large mammals. In all, 0.03% BC treatment of mouse and canine testes in vitro led to Sertoli cell elimination, but also caused PMC depletion and reduced the number of Leydig and germ cells. These results indicate that the dose and time to engraftment will require optimization for each species.",
                "Alongside this discovery, we developed methods for engraftment of Sertoli cells or multiple testis cell types. An ultrasound-guided seminiferous tubule transplantation technique has already been established for primates and humans27, thus our method is technically feasible for clinical applications. Sertoli cells used for engraftment could be derived via an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) strategy28 to avoid immune rejection. In cases where the defect in Sertoli cells is identified through whole-exon sequencing and cross-referencing with known Sertoli essential genes (eg. KITL), it could be corrected via CRISPR-mediated genome editing strategies in iPSCs prior to transplantation following BC depletion. A proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating this approach in mice would be an important follow-up experiment. Testing the fertility of sperm generated with support from donor Sertoli cells is not feasible in this experiment, because we cannot distinguish host sperm matured in the company of donor Sertoli cells from sperm matured in regions of the host testis where host Sertoli cells survived BC treatment. In future experiments, we will replace Sertoli cells in the KitlSl/Sld mutant mouse, which lacks spermatogenesis due to a Sertoli cell defect, and perform micro insemination to test fertility.",
                "Since seminiferous transplantation was developed by Brinster29, xenogeneic transplantation has been investigated. Although human and piglet spermatogonia attach to the mouse testis basement membrane and remain for several months, they do not show further maturation30\u201332, suggesting that the mouse germ cell niche cannot support xenogeneic spermatogonia. Here, we show that cryopreserved Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and PMCs can colonize the BC-treated testis, regenerate the germ cell niche, and support spermatogenesis. Replacement of many cell types comprising the germ cell niche might make it possible to produce human sperm in an immunocompromised BC-treated mouse testis from cryopreserved tissue of pre-pubertal donors.",
                "In summary, we have identified an FDA approved, safe drug that induces severe Sertoli cell depletion when added to isolated mouse or canine testes in vitro or injected into the rete testis of mice in vivo. Using this drug, we have developed techniques for Sertoli-only transplantation and for transplantation of spermatogonia plus multiple supporting cell types. We hope to use these approaches to analyze the function of Sertoli cells, design a therapy for human idiopathic male infertility, and investigate the cross talk between niche cells and stem cells. Finally, if xenogeneic spermatogenesis can be achieved, it may not only be valuable for treatment of infertility for young cancer patients but may also be adapted to produce sperm from humans or endangered species in mice."
