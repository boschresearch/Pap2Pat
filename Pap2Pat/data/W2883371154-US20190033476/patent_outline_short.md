- limitations of current early warning systems

## SUMMARY

- introduce new statistical association

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### I. Terms

- define aftershock
- define amplitude measure
- define angular coordinates
- define other terms

### II. Method for Determining Enhancement of Earthquake Risk

- define primary earthquake event and spatial region
- introduce historical record of earthquake events
- assign earthquake events to space-time bins
- determine baseline event rates for spatial zones
- determine observed event rates for spatial zones
- evaluate p-values based on observed and baseline event rates
- accept or reject null hypothesis based on p-values
- illustrate disclosed method with diagrams
- perform forward-looking experiment to test for associated events
- filter foreshocks and aftershocks from analysis
- filter clustered events from analysis
- introduce backward-looking experiment 2
- describe experiment 2 methodology
- present results of experiment 2
- introduce second exemplary method for determining enhanced earthquake risk
- describe second method's four phases
- present results of second method
- discuss risk enhancement
- illustrate cascaded earthquake events
- conclude on earthquake risk enhancement and cascaded events

### III. Method for Generating and Disseminating an Earthquake Alert

- receive indication of primary earthquake
- determine probability measure for follow-on earthquake
- generate earthquake alert
- transmit earthquake alert to destination
- store earthquake alert in database or log file

### IV. System for Providing Earthquake Alerts

- configure system to generate and disseminate earthquake alerts

### V. A Generalized Computer Environment

- describe computing system for implementing methods
- illustrate components of computing system

### VI. General Considerations
