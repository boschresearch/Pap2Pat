                        "Osteosarcoma is the most frequent malignant primary bone tumor that occurs mainly in the young, with an incidence peak observed at 18 years of age. Despite recent improvements in chemotherapy and surgery, the problem of non-responsiveness to chemotherapy remains and this poor prognosis warrants new therapeutic strategies to improve the overall rate of survival. Osteosarcoma is characterized by a high potency to form metastases, which is the main cause of death (Ando et al., Sarcoma, 2012, 2012: 523432-523432; Odri et al., BMC Cancer, 2014, 14: 169-177).",
                        "Recent studies have described the molecular mechanisms of metastasis occurrence that can help to identify new therapeutic strategies (Barkan et al., Europ. J. Cancer, 2010, 46: 1181-1188). Carbohydrates, and especially heparin or heparan sulfate, are now considered as good candidates to treat cancers, in particular to treat cancer metastasis. However, their therapeutic use is limited because they both exhibit anticoagulant activity and therefore they can induce adverse bleeding complications. Another disadvantage of heparin and heparan sulfate is their animal origin, which can result in a high risk of unknown cross-species contamination (Stevenson et al., Research, 2007, 120: 5107-5111; Velasco et al., Drug Discov. Today, 2010, 15: 553-560). Consequently, the exploration of the therapeutic potential of heparin mimetics is now booming. Sulfated oligosaccharides are currently studied, such as a sulfated form of phosphomannopentaose and phosphomannotetraose named P1-88 (Ferro et al., Carbohydr. Res., 2001, 332: 183-189); sulfated form of maltohexose and sulfated maltotriose (Vismara et al., Molecules, 2012, 17: 9912-9930). Recently, two polysaccharides extracted from Prunella vulgaris L. were described for their anti-lung adenocarcinoma activity (Feng et al., Molecules, 2010, 15: 5096-5103).",
                        "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the isolation and identification of new microbial polysaccharides that might have new applications in diverse industries. They compete with polysaccharides from other sources such as seaweeds, crustaceans, animals or plants. Interest in mass culture of microorganisms from the marine environment has increased considerably, representing an innovative approach to the biotechnological use of under-exploited resources. When they are sulfated, polysaccharides from different sources can share some biological properties with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and especially heparan sulfate or heparin, without exhibiting the same bleeding risks and with a low risk to be contaminated by a non-conventional transmissible agent such as prions or emerging viruses due to a large \u201cspecies-barrier\u201d (DeAngelis, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 2012, 94: 295-305).",
                        "Marine bacteria associated with deep-sea hydrothermal conditions have demonstrated their ability to produce, in an aerobic carbohydrate-based medium, unusual extracellular polymers. They present original structural features that can be modified to design bioactive compounds and improve their specificity (Rehm et al., Rev. Microbiol., 2010, 8: 578-592; Colliec-Jouault et al., Handbook of Exp. Pharmacol., 2012, 423-449). In particular, with the aim of promoting biological activities, chemical modifications (depolymerization and substitution reactions) of an exopolysaccharide (GY785 EPS) produced by a deep-sea hydrothermal bacterial named Alteromonas infernus have been undertaken. The structure of the native GY785 EPS has been described (Roger et al., Carbohydr. Res., 2004, 339: 2371-2380). A low molecular weight (LMW) over-sulfated exopolysaccharide (OS-EPS) of 24 kDa has been isolated after chemical modifications of this native GY785 EPS. This LMW derivative was found to be less efficient (10 fold) than heparin in clotting assays. In activated partial thromboplastin time, the same anticoagulant effect was obtained with a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml of 24 kDa OS-EPS and with a concentration of 1.5 \u03bcg/ml of heparin, respectively (Colliec-Jouault et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 2001, 1528: 141-151).",
                        "The growth and differentiation of bone cells is controlled by various factors that can be modulated by heparan sulfates. The effects of the 24 kDa OS-EPS on bone biology have previously been studied. The effect of this highly sulfated LMW derivative (40% sulfate groups) has been compared to that of a non-oversulfated LWM EPS of 13 kDa (10% sulfate groups). The observed data have shown different levels of bone resorption regulation by GAGs or OS-EPS, most of them leading to pro-resorptive effects (Velasco et al., Glycobiology, 2011, 21: 781-795).",
                        "In spite of the progress made in promoting biological properties of exopolysaccharides, there still remains a need in the art to provide new therapeutic strategies to improve the overall rate of survival in metastatic cancer, in particular in metastatic osteosarcoma."

Indeed, in in vitro experiments, they first compared the activity of three low-molecular-weight over-sulfated polysaccharides with different molecular weights (4 kD (GYS4), 8 kDa (GYS8) and 15 kDa (GYS15)) on osteosarcoma cell lines (mouse POS-1 and human HOS cell lines), using heparin as a reference. Proliferation, migration, cell cycle analysis and expression in osteosarcoma cell lines of matrix metalloproteinases such as gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 and their inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were studied. Then, GYS15, which showed the most interesting properties in vitro was evaluated in vivo on both primary malignant bone tumor growth (paratibial model) and formation of lung metastases in an osteosarcoma mouse model, again using heparin as a reference. The results obtained showed that GYS15 was very efficient at inhibiting the formation of lung metastases in vivo.",

The nature of the reducing agents that can be used to this effect is not essential. In particular, the reducing agent may be sodium borohydride.",

Finally, the purified polysaccharide derivatives are conditioned in salt form by addition of a weak or strong base that may be chosen, for example, from pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. This lyophilized salt may be prepared, for example, by elution of an aqueous solution of the polysaccharide derivatives at a concentration of between 1 and 8 mg/ml on an ion exchange resin column such as, for example, those sold under the name DOWEX\u00ae by the company Dow Chemical. The eluate is collected as long as the pH remains acid, for example less than 5, then the pH is subsequently adjusted to approximately 6.5 with the desired base as defined above.

The amount of polysaccharide derivatives present in the anhydrous solvent may be between approximately 1 and 10 mg/ml, preferably between about 1 mg/ml and about 5 mg/ml, and even more preferably this amount is about 2.5 mg/ml. The dissolution of the EPS in the anhydrous solvent is preferably carried out, with stirring, at ambient temperature for about 1 hour to about 2 hours and then at a temperature of between 40\u00b0 C. and 50\u00b0 C., preferably at a temperature of about 45\u00b0 C. for about 2 hours under argon or azote with molecular sieve.",

The one or more chemical sulfation agents are added to the solution of polysaccharide derivatives in a weight amount preferably representing from about 4 to about 6 times, and even more preferably about 5 times, the mass of polysaccharide derivatives in solution. The chemical sulfation reaction is then preferably carried out with stirring for a period of between 2 and 24 hours depending on the desired degree of sulfation. When the desired degree of sulfation is reached, the sulfation reaction is stopped after cooling of the reaction medium:\n\n\n- - either by precipitation in the presence of sodium-chloride-saturated\n    acetone or of methanol, and then dissolution of the precipitate in\n    water;\n  - or, preferably, by addition of water in a proportion preferably\n    equal to 1/10 of the reaction volume and adjustment of the pH of the\n    reaction medium to 9 with a basifying agent such as, for example,\n    sodium hydroxide (3 M).",

The final product (i.e., GYS15), typically with an accurate molecular weight and a low polydispersity index, is obtained by isolation from the low-molecular weight depolymerized EPS obtained. Isolation may be performed by any suitable method known in the art. Preferably, isolation is carried out by fractionation performed by size exclusion chromatography.",

The polydispersity index (PDI) according to the invention is a measure of the distribution of molecular mass of the derivatives.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 2,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solution or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid may also be used in the preparation of injectable formulations. Sterile liquid carriers are useful in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.",
                                "Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or suspensions can be administered by, for example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Injection may be via single push or by gradual infusion. Where necessary or desired, the composition may include a local anesthetic to ease pain at the site of injection.",
                                "In order to prolong the effect of an active ingredient, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the ingredient from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Delaying absorption of a parenterally administered active ingredient may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the ingredient in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming micro-encapsulated matrices of the active ingredient in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of active ingredient to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of ingredient release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations can also be prepared by entrapping the active ingredient in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.",
                                "Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and pressurized compositions. In addition to the GYS derivative, the liquid dosage form may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvent, solubilising agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cotton seed, ground nut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, suspending agents, preservatives, sweetening, flavouring, and perfuming agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizes or osmo-regulators. Examples of suitable liquid carriers for oral administration include water (potentially containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols such as glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For pressurized compositions, the liquid carrier can be halogenated hydrocarbon or other pharmaceutically acceptable propellant.",
                                "Solid dosage forms for oral administration include, for example, capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the inventive GYS derivative may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and one or more of: (a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannital, and silicic acid; (b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia; (c) humectants such as glycerol; (d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay; and (i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. Other excipients suitable for solid formulations include surface modifying agents such as non-ionic and anionic surface modifying agents. Representative examples of surface modifying agents include, but are not limited to, poloxamer 188, benzalkonium chloride, calcium stearate, cetostearyl alcohol, cetomacrogol emulsifying wax, sorbitan esters, colloidal silicon dioxide, phosphates, sodium dodecylsulfate, magnesium aluminum silicate, and triethanolamine. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.",

The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferably, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delaying manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.",

Other topical carriers include liquid petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol (95%), polyoxyethylenemonolaurat (5%) in water, or sodium lauryl sulfate (5%) in water. Other materials such as antioxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers, and similar agents may be added as necessary.",

Such devices include patches, implants, and injections which release the active ingredient by either passive or active release mechanisms. Transdermal administrations include all administration across the surface of the body and the inner linings of bodily passage including epithelial and mucosal tissues. Such administrations may be carried out using the present compositions in lotions, creams, foams, patches, suspensions, solutions, and suppositories (rectal and vaginal).",
                                "Transdermal administration may be accomplished through the use of a transdermal patch containing an active ingredient (i.e., the GYS derivative) and a carrier that is non-toxic to the skin, and allows the delivery of the ingredient for systemic absorption into the bloodstream via the skin. The carrier may take any number of forms such as creams and ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The creams and ointments may be viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions of either the oil-in-water or water-in-oil type. Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in petroleum or hydrophilic petroleum containing the active ingredient may be suitable. A variety of occlusive devices may be used to release the active ingredient into the bloodstream such as a semi-permeable membrane covering a reservoir containing the active ingredient with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the active ingredient.",
                                "Suppository formulations may be made from traditional materials, including cocoa butter, with or without the addition of waxes to alter the suppository's melting point, and glycerine. Water soluble suppository bases, such as polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights, may also be used.",

The preparation, purification and characterization of low molecular weight (LMW) over-sulfated (OS) EPS derivatives were performed as previously reported (Ruiz Velasco et al., Glycobiology, 2011, 21: 781-795; WO 2006/003290). Briefly, native high molecular weight (HMW) GY785 EPS was depolymerized first using a free-radical depolymerisation process to obtain LMW derivatives with different molecular weights. LMW GY785 EPS derivatives were then sulfated in dimethylformamide (DMF) using pyridine sulfate as sulfating agent leading to LMW OS-EPS derivatives. Molecular weights (Mws) before and after sulfation were determined by HPSEC-MALS and sulfur content (wt % S) by HPAEC chromatography. ATR-FTIR and NMR spectroscopy were used to assess the efficiency of sulfation reaction. Heparin sodium salt from porcine intestinal mucosa H4784 was purchased from Sigma.",

The tumor volume (V) was calculated from the measurement of two perpendicular diameters using a caliper, according to the following formula: V=0.5\u00d7L\u00d7(S)2, wherein L and S are, respectively, the largest and smallest perpendicular tumor diameters. A curative protocol was performed, when the tumor volume reached 100 mm3, mice were treated with PBS (control) or with the LMW OS-EPS derivative. The polysaccharides diluted in PBS buffer (50 \u03bcL) were injected subcutaneously each day at 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg and the tumor growth was measured from Day 5 to Day 35. This mouse model (paratibial model) was preferred to the model using the injection of tumor cells directly into the tibia (intratibial model) because bone lesions were very similar at the end of the experiment in the two models and because the results are more reproducible in the former model (i.e., the paratibial model). In addition, the paratibial model mimics more closely the bone lesions observed in human."

The most potent LMW OS-EPS derivative to inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma cell lines was found to be GYS4 (FIG. 1A). GYS8 was equally potent as heparin to inhibit POS-1 cell proliferation but they did not act as efficiently on cells of the HOS cell line (FIG. 1A). While 3 days of treatment with GYS15 did not result in any significant effect on HOS cell proliferation, 25 \u03bcg/mL of GYS15 markedly decreased the HOS cell proliferation after 7 days of treatment (FIG. 1B). In terms of cell viability, no significant difference was observed between all tested compounds compared to the controls (data not shown). Based on these results, it can be hypothesized that the LMW OS-EPS derivatives (GYS4 and GYS8) exert their activities through an indirect effect requiring the release of a second biological messenger. These data are in agreement with those obtained with an OS-EPS 24 kDa on osteoblastic cells (Ruiz Velasco et al., Glycobiology, 2011, 21: 781-795).",

All compounds assessed (GYS4, GYS8, GYS15 and heparin) were found to inhibit the migration of murine POS-1 osteosarcoma cells (data not shown). In contrast to this cell line, only GYS4 and GYS15 exhibited the ability to inhibit the migration of human HOS osteosarcoma cells (FIG. 2), in particular GYS15 was found to strongly slow down the migration of HOS cells compared to the other compounds.",

Thromb. Hemost., 2007, 33: 688-694). In vitro and in vivo experimental evidence demonstrated that heparin is an efficient inhibitor of cell migration, adhesion and metastasis (Laubli et al., Cancer Invest., 2009, 27: 474-481). Common molecular pathways with platelet-tumor cell thrombi formation such as the inhibition of heparanase or P-/L-selectin may be involved in this activity (Fritze et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 2006, 72: 474-485). In contrast to heparin, the LMW OS-EPS derivatives assessed in the present work inhibited the cell migration of osteosarcoma, suggesting a mechanism of action that is independent of heparanase and selectin. Mechanisms associating inhibition of integrin activity can be hypothesized (Kapp et al., Expert Opin. Ther. Pat., 2013, 23: 1273-1295).",

                                "Since GYS15 was found to modulate human HOS osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion, the present Inventors analyzed the expression of the main key regulators of these processes, especially MMPs and their TIMP inhibitors. As expected, human HOS osteosarcoma cells expressed MMP-2, MMP-9 as well as their inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (FIG. 5). MMP-2 and its inhibitor (TIMP-2) were not modulated by the treatment with GYS15 or with heparin. In contrast, MMP-9 expression was increased by GYS15 in a time-dependent manner. Indeed, 50 \u03bcg/ml of GYS15 induced a two-fold increase of MMP-9 mRNA expression compared to the untreated cells (FIG. 5). Simultaneously, GYS15 was found to up-modulate the expression of TIMP-1, which is a natural inhibitor of MMP-9 activity. Heparin only modulated the expression of TIMP-1 (FIG. 5).",
                                "Whether MMP-9 is linked to the migration, proliferation and invasiveness of osteosarcoma cells (Zhang et al., Int. Immunopharmacol., 2015, 24: 50-58; Ma et al., Eur. Rev. Med. Pharmacol. Sci., 2013, 17: 1102-1109), the use of MMP-9 as biomarker of survival in patients with osteosarcoma remains controversial (Li et al., Tumour Biol., 2014, 5: 5487-5491; Zhang et al., Tumour Biol., 2015, 36: 35: 5-6). Nevertheless, the anti-invasion and anti-migration properties of GYS15 can be partly explained by the modulation of the balance between MMP-9 and its inhibitor TIMP-1 (Cottam and Rees, Int. J. Oncol., 1993, 2: 861-872). GYS15 increased both MMP-9 and TIMP-1; however the resulting balance between the enzyme and its inhibitor is in favor of the inhibition.",

A curative treatment was performed on a mouse model (paratibial model) of osteosarcoma induced by inoculation with cells of the mouse POS-1 cell line or of the human HOS cell line. The treatment started when the tumor volume reached 100 mm3 (Day 0) and the mice were divided in 3 groups: 1\u2014treated with PBS (control); 2\u2014treated with GYS15 and 3\u2014treated with heparin. The polysaccharides were injected subcutaneously (50 \u03bcL) each day at 2 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg and the tumor growth was measured from Day 5 to Day 9. The tumor growth was similar in the 3 groups (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both GYS15 and heparin had no effect on the primary osteosarcoma tumor induced by either the mouse POS-1 cell line (data not shown) or the human HOS cell line (FIG. 6). Both polysaccharides were not able to inhibit primary tumor growth in preclinical osteosarcoma mouse models. GYS15 had no pro-apoptotic effect on osteosarcoma cells as analyzed by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining (TUNEL) (data not shown).",

                                "A preventive treatment was conceived to study the effect of GYS15 on the metastatic ability of osteosarcoma by the technique of retro-orbital injection of the venous sinus in mice (Cottam and Rees, Int. J. Oncol., 1993, 2: 861-872). In this experiment, mice received POS-1 cells, metastases arising spontaneously after POS-1 cell line injection. GYS15-treated mice exhibited significantly less metastases (a decrease of around 40%) than the untreated mice or heparin treated ones (p<0.001) (FIG. 7A). The histological analyses of lung tissue showed that GYS15-treated mice did not exhibit the presence of metastatic foci similarly to heparin in contrast to the control group treated with a vehicle (PBS) (FIG. 7C). This lower incidence of detectable lung metastases was accompanied by an improvement of animal survival rate, 70% of treated animals survived 65 days after the POS-1 cell line injection whereas in control group only 14% of the animals survived that long (FIG. 7C). As expected, heparin decreased the incidence of lung metastatic incidence (Laubli et al., Cancer Invest., 2009, 27: 474-481; Falanga et al., Semin. Thromb. Hemost., 2007, 33: 688-694). No adverse effects of GYS15 were observed in mice. Therefore, GYS15 exhibits anti-metastatic activity and its low efficiency in clotting assays (Roger et al., Carbohydr. Res., 2004, 339: 2371-2380; Ruiz Velasco et al., Glycobiology, 2011, 21: 781-795), is clearly an added therapeutic value."

With their low efficiency in clotting assays and their ability to reduce the in vitro invasiveness of osteosarcoma cells as well as the metastatic process, LMW OS-EPSs represent a new class of polysaccharides with high interest in oncology. In the present study, only GYS15 was able to effectively inhibit both migration and invasiveness of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Moreover, GYS15 was found to be very efficient at inhibiting the formation of lung metastases in vivo.",
