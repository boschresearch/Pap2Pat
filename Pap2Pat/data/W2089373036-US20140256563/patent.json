According to embodiments of the present disclosure, preferably, the nucleic acid sample is fragmented to obtain a nucleic acid fragment having a length of 200 bp to 300 bp.

The advantages and the characteristics of the sequencing-library and the method of constructing the same previously described in detail may also apply to the method of determining the methylation distribution information of the exome in the human whole genome, so a detailed description thereof will be omitted here. Recent research (Brenet F et al. 2011; Harder A et al. 2010; Suzuki M M et al. 2008, which are incorporated by reference herein) has found out that: existence of the methylated exon is more prevalent than that of previously appreciated and expected; methylation distributions of the first exon and the first intron are much different from methylation distributions of a downstream exon and a downstream intron; and the methylation level in most downstream regions does not closely relate to gene expression. In short, the relationship of the methylation level surrounding a transcription initial site and the methylation level of the first exon with gene silence is much closer than that of the methylation level of a promoter in upstream region with gene silence. Analyzing the methylation level of exon plays an important role in studying on gene expression.",
