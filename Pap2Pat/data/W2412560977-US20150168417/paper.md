# Methods And Materials

## Animals

Adult (6 mo.) non-transgenic C57BL6/J mice were used in this study. All experimental protocols were approved by the University of Houston Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.

## Tissue Processing

Animals were euthanized with CO2 and brains were harvested. Brains were either fixed with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde-free fixative. For formaldehyde fixation, transcardial perfusion with heparinized (2.5 IU/mL) saline followed by 30 ml of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) was used. Brains were then dissected and post-fixed in 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde for 48-72 hr at 4 °C. After fixation brains were processed for paraffin sections (10 μ). For formalin-free fixation, brains were submersed in Accustain (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for three days and then transferred to 70% ethanol solution and stored at 4 °C. Brains were then processed for paraffin sections (10 μ).

## Antigen Retrieval

Paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. For all antigen retrieval experiments, a Decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) was used for heating. For sodium citrate, slides were heated in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) initially at 80 °C and peaked at 125 °C for 45 s and then cooled back down to 80 °C for a total of 45 min. Pepsin AR treatment followed protocol reported by Franciosi et al.15 For formaldehyde scavengers (2-imidazolidinone, ascorbic acid, and tris) pH was adjusted to 3-4 and slides were initially heated to 80 °C then raised to 95 °C, held for 45 min, then cooled back down to 80 °C for a total of 60 min.

## Immunofluorescence

Tissues were deparaffinized using xylene, graded ethanol baths and rehydration in water. Following rehydration, immunofluorescence was performed on hemibrain sections using the Type IV Collagen antibody (anti-Collagen IV, 1:500, Cosmo Bio USA, Carlsbad, CA) that recognizes the basal lamina of blood vessels and Claudin 5 (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a tight-junction protein. Sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit goat antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized using an avidin-linked fluorophore (Vector Laboratories). Slides were imaged using standard epifluorescence conditions using an Olympus IX61 DSU confocal microscope.

## Mass Spectrometry

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on an AB Sciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer using AB Sciex 4000 Series Data Explorer control and processing software (V3.7.1 Build 1, AB Sciex). Samples (0.7 μl) were combined with 0.7 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in 50% acetonitrile in water with 1% formic acid and spotted onto a 96-well AB Sciex MALDI plate. Each sample was deposited on two different spots. Each spectrum acquired was a composite of 250–500 laser shots. Typically 2–3 spectra for each spot were acquired and only one representative spectrum is displayed in the figures.

The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer was operated in the delayed extraction/reflector mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, a grid voltage setting of 72%, and a 500 ns delay. Positively charged ions were analyzed in reflection mode. External calibration was performed with a mixture of 5 standard peptides at approximately 100 ng peptides per 10 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution: Des-Arg(9) Bradykinin (m/z = 904.4676 Da), Human Angiotensin 1 (m/z = 1296.6848 Da), Glu-1-Fibrinopeptide B (m/z = 1570.6768 Da), ACTH 1–17 (m/z = 2093.0862 Da), ACTH 18–39 (m/z = 2465.1983 Da). All peptides were purchased from Bachem.

## Antigen Retrieval Experiments With Model Peptides

For studies using model peptides, 10 μl of a solution of human angiotensin I (DRVYIHPFHL) purchased from Bachem (5 mg/ml water) or ACTH (18–39 clip) (RPVKVYPNGAEDESAEAFPLEF) (5 mg/ml water) was added to 40 μL formalin (pH 6.8). The mixture was kept at 4 °C for 48 h prior to mass spectrometry.

To the formalin treated peptide (2 μL) was added 98 μl of reagent (5% w/v solution); reagents tested were: ascorbic acid, 2-imidazolidinone, and tris (both buffered to pH 3–4). The mixture was heated at 95–98 °C for 45 min. The reaction was monitored by MALDI-TOF at 3 time points (0 min, 20 min, and 45 min). Experiments were repeated at least 3 times and representative spectra are displayed from the 45 min time point.

## Ar Agent Prevents Transfer Of Formaldehyde Label From Formaldehyde-Treated Myoglobin To Acth (18–39)

Equine Myoglobin (200 μg, Aldrich) (Measured m/z = 17150.48 Da, average of 7 measurements) was treated with 200 μL formalin (47%, pH 6.8) for 48 h at 4 oC. (Measured m/z = 17776.32 Da, average of 7 measurements).

The formylated myoglobin was concentrated with a Vivaspin 500 3 kDa cut-off filter (GE Healthcare), washed with water (250 μL) for six times, lyophilized, and taken up in 200 μL of water.

Human ACTH (18–39) (1 μL from 0.5 mg/ml stock Bachem) was added to the formylated myoglobin solution (20 μL) and 1 μL of water. Similarly Human ACTH (18–39) (1 μL) was added to formylated myoglobin (20 μL) and 1 μL of ascorbic acid (500 mg/mL water). Mixtures were heated at 95 oC for 1.5 h and monitored by MALDI as described above.
