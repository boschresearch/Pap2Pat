    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a novel mechanism to control RNA virus replication and gene expression using a conditional protease approach using a specific protease inhibitor for regulation. More specifically it relates to a single-stranded RNA virus, preferably of the order Mononegavirales, comprising a polynucleotide sequence encoding at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, a protease and a cleavage site for said protease. The protease can be inhibited using a protease inhibitor and hence the protease and the cleavage site for said protease form a regulatable switch. By changing the insertion site of the regulatable switch from an INTRA- to an INTER-molecular location in the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, the effect of the protease inhibitor can be altered from an ON switch to an OFF switch. RNA virus may further encode a heterologous protein, the expression of which is then regulated by regulating viral activity. The ON switch may also be used in an RNA virus to directly regulate heterologous protein expression. Further provided are in vivo and in vitro uses of said virus with conditional viral activity or heterologous protein expression.",

                        "Genetically modified viruses have shown great potential as efficient gene therapy vectors, for viral immunotherapy or as oncolytic viruses in cancer virotherapy. Generally these three different types of treatments utilize gene overexpression, gene knockdown using RNA interference and suicide gene delivery. In a therapeutic setting temporal control of transgene or viral gene expression constitutes both a safety switch and a potency dial. While modifiers of activity of DNA viruses are well established, such as regulatable promoters (e.g. Tet system), these mechanisms cannot be used to regulate most RNA viruses (retroviruses being the exception).",
                        "Aptazymes are a mechanism to tightly control RNA viruses (Ketzer et al., PNAS, 2014, 111(5): E554-62). An aptazyme consists of an RNA structure responding to a small compound (aptamer) and an enzymatically active RNA (ribozyme). This mechanism was shown to be able to regulate spread of the RNA measles virus by serving as an OFF-switch to its fusion protein. However, viral transcription or replication activity was not controlled. In measles virus, aptazymes had to be placed into both 3\u2032- and 5\u2032 UTRs of the viral fusion protein to achieve effective inhibition of viral spread, resulting in reduction of viral progeny by 3 logarithmic orders. Inhibition was applied at a late stage of the virus replication cycle, i.e. fusion. Apparently, even small amounts of fusion protein are sufficient to facilitate virus spread. Therefore, the reduction of 3 logarithmic orders was only accomplished with a multistep infection assay (low MOI of 0.0001) and a long observation period of 8 days. Single insertions of aptazymes in either 3\u2032- or 5\u2032 UTRs did not drastically reduce titers.",
                        "Following a different approach, OFF switch control of measles virus RNA replication was shown via small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh)-tags fused C-terminally to the viral P-protein (Chung et al., Nature Chemical Biology, 2015, 11:713-722) controlling degradation of the protein.",
                        "We sought to develop a regulatable systems based on conditional proteolysis, which involved cloning of the small human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease (99 amino acids) flanked by HIV protease cleavage sites into different loci of the genome of the RNA vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) as a model protease. The HIV protease is active as a homodimer and functions as aspartyl protease. In HIV, it cleaves the polyprotein that is translated from the positive strand genome, into functional proteins. Since the HIV protease is essential for its virus replication cycle, several protease inhibitors have been approved by drug administration agencies and new inhibitors are being developed. One such protease inhibitor is amprenavir, which binds in the catalytic center between the HIV protease homodimers, thereby mitigating its function.",
                        "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a negative-sense single-strand RNA virus and prototypical member of the family Rhabdoviridae, is widely studied as vaccine vector, oncolytic virus, and tracing tool. Despite its broad use in virology basic science and the development of therapeutic viruses, VSV, being an RNA virus, has so far not been shown to be externally regulatable. The VSV RNA genome includes five viral genes in the following order from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032: nucleoprotein (N-protein), followed by the phosphoprotein (P-protein), the matrix protein (M-protein), the glycoprotein (G-protein) and finally the polymerase or large protein (L-protein). All VSV genes are transcribed in a sequential manner by the VSV polymerase using the same entry site at the 3\u2032end (upstream the N-protein) from which transcription is initiated. The genes are interspersed with intergenic regions that enable the transcription of several viral mRNAs from one RNA genome. The first viral protein, the N protein covers the viral RNA genome and interacts with the viral polymerase complex, which is formed by the P- and L-protein. The M-protein forms the viral capsid and obstructs cellular translation via blockage of nuclear pores. The G-protein facilitates cell attachment and entry and its fusogenic characteristic constitutes another pathogenicity factor. VSVs clinical development has been limited by potential neurotoxic adverse effects shown in laboratory animals."

                        "We present here for the first time a regulatory switch putting the activity of an RNA virus under conditional control in the presence of an exogenously applied clinically approved compound. By changing the insertion site of the switch from an INTRA- to an INTER-molecular location, we can flip the effect of the compound from an ON switch to an OFF switch. These regulatory elements provide novel safety measures for RNA viruses currently considered for development as therapeutic viruses in the field of oncology and vaccinations. Furthermore, dependence on the presence of an applied drug provides an environmental safety shield in case of shedding of viruses during therapy. For the ON-switch, an autocatalytically active protease, such as the HIV protease, is inserted into an intramolecular insertion site, i.e., into the open reading frame, of an essential protein, such as the P-protein and/or the L-protein of the prototypical negative-stranded RNA virus, such as VSV. Addition of protease specific inhibitors, such as HIV protease inhibitors, prevent the cleavage of these essential viral proteins and viral polymerase activity can proceed. We further identified a new insertion site in the L-protein that only mildly affects viral replication. For the OFF-switch the autocatalytically active protease is inserted into an intermolecular insertion site and is fused to an essential protein, generating a non-functional fusion protein. Autoproteolysis releases the functional essential protein, such as the L-protein of the prototypical negative-stranded RNA virus VSV. Addition of specific protease inhibitors, such as HIV protease inhibitors, prevent the cleavage of the dysfunctional polyprotein and therefore blocks viral polymerase activity.",

These terms also include proteins that are post-translationally modified through reactions that include, but are not limited to, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, glycation or protein processing. Modifications and changes, for example amino acid sequence substitutions, deletions or insertions, can be made in the structure of a polypeptide while the molecule maintains its biological functional activity. For example certain amino acid sequence substitutions can be made in a polypeptide or its underlying nucleic acid coding sequence and a protein can be obtained with the same properties. The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d typically refers to a sequence with more than 10 amino acids and the term \u201cpeptide\u201d means sequences with up to 10 amino acids in length.

A fusion protein may contain full length proteins (i.e., comprising all functional domains) or a fragments thereof, such as one or more functional domain(s), a consensus motive, a cleavage site fused to another full length proteins (i.e., comprising all functional domains) or a fragments thereof. Fused means that the nucleotide sequence coding for the first polypeptide to the nucleotide sequence coding for the second polypeptide in frame, such that the nucleotide sequence will be expressed as a single protein. A polyprotein is a subtype of fusion proteins, typically occurring in RNA viruses. A polyprotein is a protein generated by translation of a single mRNA encoding several proteins in a single open reading frame, i.e., fused to each other (multicistronic mRNA). The polyprotein is processed post-translationally or co-translationally into single proteins, typically via proteases.",

However, in the context of the present invention the term \u201cgenome\u201d typically also refers to the genome of an RNA virus and hence an RNA genome having a ribonucleic acid sequence. The person skilled in the art will understand that the genome of an RNA virus may also be provided as a DNA sequence in a vector, such as a plasmid. The RNA genome is then generated in a host cell following transfection of the host cell via transcription.",

Genes and polynucleotides may include introns and exons as in genomic sequence, or just the coding sequences as in cDNAs, such as an open reading frame (ORF), comprising a start codon (methionine codon) and a translation stop codon. Genes and polynucleotides can also include regions that regulate their expression, such as transcription initiation, translation and transcription termination. Thus, also included are regulatory elements such as a promoter.",

RNAs are usually single stranded molecules and can exert various functions. The term ribonucleic acid specifically comprises messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), short interfering RNA (siRNA), small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA), each of which plays a specific role in biological cells. It includes small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNA), short interfering RNAs (siRNA), small hairpin RNA (shRNA), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA). The term \u201cnon-coding\u201d means that the RNA molecule is not translated into an amino acid sequence.",

One type of vector is a \u201cplasmid\u201d, which refers to a linear or circular double stranded DNA molecule into which additional nucleic acid segments can be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector (e.g., retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, VSV and MeV replication defective or active form), wherein additional DNA or RNA segments can be introduced into the viral genome.",

The second molecule may have a chemical structure that is different from the chemical nature of the first molecule. For example, the term \u201cencode\u201d describes the process of semi-conservative DNA replication, where one strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule is used as a template to encode a newly synthesized complementary sister strand by a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Further, a DNA molecule can encode an RNA molecule (e.g., by uses a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) or a RNA molecule (negative stranded) can encode an RNA molecule (positive-stranded) (e.g., by use of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Also, an RNA molecule (positive-stranded) can encode a polypeptide, as in the process of translation. When used to describe the process of translation, the term \u201cencode\u201d also extends to the triplet codon that encodes an amino acid. An RNA molecule can also encode a DNA molecule, e.g., by the process of reverse transcription using an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. When referring to a DNA molecule encoding a polypeptide, a process of transcription and translation is referred to.",

In the context of the present invention the skilled person would understand that it refers to a protein not naturally expressed by the virus. The term \u201cheterologous\u201d when used with reference to portions of a protein may also indicate that the protein comprises two or more amino acid sequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. In the context of the present invention it is typically a therapeutic protein, an antigen, such as a tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigen, or a reporter (such as luciferase or a fluorescent protein).",

Cytokines may be secreted by immune or other cells, such as T-cells, B-cells, NK cells and macrophages. Cytokines may be involved in intercellular signaling events, such as autocrine signaling, paracrine signaling and endocrine signaling. They may mediate a range of biological processes including, but not limited to immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. Cytokines may be chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines or tumor necrosis factors.",

                        "The term \u201cexpression\u201d as used herein refers to transcription and/or translation of a heterologous nucleic acid sequence within a host cell. The level of expression of a gene product of interest in a host cell may be determined on the basis of either the amount of the corresponding mRNA (or positive-stranded RNA) that is present in the cell, or the amount of the polypeptide encoded by the selected sequence. For example, RNA transcribed from a selected sequence can be quantified by Northern blot hybridization, ribonuclease RNA protection, in situ hybridization to cellular RNA or by PCR, such as qPCR. Proteins encoded by a selected sequence can be quantitated by various methods, e.g. by ELISA, by Western blotting, by radioimmunoassay, by immunoprecipitation, by assaying for the biological activity of the protein, by immunostaining of the protein followed by FACS analysis or by homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assays. The level of expression of a non-coding RNA, such as a miRNA or shRNA may be quantified by PCR, such as qPCR.",

Thus, a measurement of the level of expression of the reporter is typically indicative of the level of transcription and/or translation. The gene encoding the reporter is a reporter gene. For example, a reporter gene can encode a reporter, for example, an enzyme whose activity can be quantified, for example, alkaline phosphatase (AP), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), Renilla luciferase or firefly luciferase protein(s). Reporters also include fluorescent proteins, for example, green fluorescent protein (GFP) or any of the recombinant variants of GFP, including enhanced GFP (EGFP), blue fluorescent proteins (BFP and other derivatives), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP and other derivatives), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP and other derivatives) and red fluorescent protein (RFP and other derivatives) or other fluorescent proteins, such as mCherry and mWasabi.",
                        "The term \u201cprotease\u201d or \u201cproteinase\u201d are used herein synonymously and refer to an enzyme that helps proteolysis, i.e., protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases can be classified into seven broad groups of serine proteases, cysteine proteases, threonine proteases, aspartic proteases, glutamic proteases, metalloproteases and asparagine peptide lyases. Proteases occur in all organisms, in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses. In principle all proteases are suitable in the context of the present invention as long as they are highly specific, i.e., have a restricted set of substrate sequences, and a specific inhibitor is available. The protease inhibitor should be specific for the protease and be known to be suitable for in vivo use, i.e., being safe, bioavailable and active in vivo, such as following oral or parenteral administration to a subject, preferably a human subject. Viral proteases are advantageous as they are common targets for antiviral drugs and hence a number of protease inhibitors inhibiting viral proteases have been approved and tested to be safe in humans. For example, for the human immune deficiency (HIV) protease, various well-characterized protease inhibitors are available and allow regulation of the system with desired kinetics. Example of suitable HIV protease inhibitors are without being limited thereto, e.g., indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenevir, atazanavir, tipranavir and darunavir. In therapy the protease inhibitor, particularly the HIV protease inhibitor, may be administered in combination with ritonavir. Ritonavir augments the plasma concentration of the other protease inhibitors. Human proteases are advantages as they are endogenous proteins to human patients and hence do not elicit an immune response. The protease used in the RNA virus according to the invention is a heterologous protease, i.e., a protease not endogenous to the virus. The term \u201cProt\u201d or \u201cprot\u201d as used herein is an abbreviation of protease, thus e.g., L-Prot refers to the L-protein comprising an intramolecular protease as disclosed herein and P-Prot refers to the P-protein comprising an intramolecular protease as disclosed herein or Prot-L refers to a protease fused to the L-protein and Prot-P refers to a protease fused to the P-protein.",
                        "The protease may be a monomer or a dimer. Preferably a dimer is used in form of a single-chain dimer, by linking the monomers via a flexible linker. Examples for a protease that is active only as a dimer is the HIV protease used in the Examples. As explained for the HIV-1 protease, single-chain dimers are preferably codon-optimized to avoid homology between the first and second protease. A codon optimized single-chain dimer of HIV 1 protease may, e.g., have the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. This reduces the risk of \u201ccopy-choice\u201d recombination events as previously described in VSV (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011), in which the viral polymerase, the L-protein, can switch between templates and skip sequence stretches. \u201cCopy-choice\u201d occurs when the polymerase is guided by sequence homology of the nascent RNA strand with the newly chosen template. Preferably the protease is autocatalytically active, i.e., it mediates cis-cleavage. This may be an inherent property of the protease or may be generated by cloning the respective cleavage site in close proximity to the protease, i.e., the protease has a N-terminal and/or a C-terminal cleavage site. Preferably the protease is framed by a cleavage site for said protease on either side. Thus, the protease has two cleavage sites for said protease, one on the N-terminal side and one on the C-terminal side of the protease. Preferably the two cleavage sites are not identical. The protease having a cleavage site may further have a linker on one or both side, either flanking the cleavage site on one or both sides or alternatively between the protease and the one or more cleavage sites.",
                        "Thus, the regulatory element or \u201cswitch\u201d according to the present invention comprises a protease, at least one cleavage site for said protease and a protease inhibitor specific for said protease.",
                        "The term \u201cRNA virus\u201d as used herein refers to a virus that has a ribonucleic acid (RNA) as its genetic material. RNA viruses may be single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded (dsRNA). Single-stranded RNA viruses include the category (Phylum) \u201cnegative-sense ssRNA virus\u201d (Negarnaviricota), which includes among others the order Mononegavirales and Articulavirales (comprising the family orthomyxovirus, which includes the influenza virus) and the category \u201cpositive-sense ssRNA virus\u201d, such as Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Enteroviridae. The negative-sense ssRNA viruses, particularly of the order Mononegavirales, include, Bornaviridae (e.g., Borna disease Virus (BDV), Nyamaviridae (Nyamanini virus (NYMV), Rhabdoviridae (rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Maraba virus), Filobiridae (Ebola virus including EBOV), Paramyxoviridae (comprising measles virus (MeV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV)), and Pneumoviridae (e.g., Human Respiratory Syncytial-Virus (HRSV)). In the context of the present invention Rhabdoviridae and Paramyxoviridae are preferred, more preferably RNA virus of the genus Vesiculovirus.",
                        "Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and must be converted into positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. Thus, purified RNA of a negative-sense RNA is not infectious as it needs to be transcribed first, which requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase comprised in the virus particle (virion). The sequence of recombinant RNA viruses is commonly provided as cDNA sequence, as the RNA sequence is reverse transcribed for sequencing.",
                        "The term \u201clinker\u201d refers to a sequence coding for a separating peptide of variable length of about 6 to 30 amino acids, preferably 7 to 15 amino acids that separate different parts of a protein without affecting the function of the different parts of the protein or having a function on its own. A linker may be flexible or rigid, preferably the linker is a flexible linker. Preferably no linker is used between the protease cleavage site and the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication."

                                "In another aspect the invention relates to a single-stranded RNA virus comprising a modified genome of the virus comprising a polynucleotide sequence encoding at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, a protease and a cleavage site for said protease, wherein the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication is encoded as a fusion protein comprising the protease fused to the N-terminal or C-terminal end, separated by the cleavage site for said protease. The fusion protein may or may not comprise a linker between the cleavage site and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, such as a glycine-serine linker. More generally the fusion protein may or may not comprise a linker between the protease and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, i.e., between the protease and the cleavage site or between the cleavage site and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. Preferably the fusion protein does not comprise a linker between the cleavage site and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. Alternatively the fusion protein may or may not comprise a linker between the protease and the cleavage site. The protease cleaves at the cleavage site for said protease located at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication encoded as a fusion protein to release the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. Thus, the protease and the protease cleavage site for said protease are at an intermolecular location. Proteolytic release of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication renders said protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication active. In other words the proteolytic cleavage releases the active at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. The term \u201crelease\u201d or \u201cproteolytic release\u201d as used herein refers to the removal of sequences fused to the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication that inactivate said protein.

Thus, the fusion protein may or may not comprise a linker between the cleavage site and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication; or alternatively the fusion protein may or may not comprise a linker between the protease and the cleavage site. Preferably the fusion protein does not comprise a linker between the cleavage site and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. However, no further elements are required for inactivation of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication in said fusion protein. Thus, the fusion protein may consist of the protease fused to the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, separated by the cleavage site for said protease and optionally a linker. The fusion protein may also comprise or consist of (a) the protease fused to the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, separated by the cleavage site for said protease, and (b) a further viral protein or a heterologous protein fused to the opposite end of the protease fused to the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, and wherein said further viral protein or heterologous protein and said protease are also separated by a cleavage site for said protease. The fusion protein optionally further comprises a linker between the protease and the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, and/or a linker between the protease and the further viral protein or heterologous protein. In this context it is important that the protease comprises a cleavage site on either side of the protease (framed by a cleavage site for said protease on either side) in order to release both proteins, the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication as well as the further viral protein or the heterologous protein. Preferably the protease is fused to the N-terminal end of the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, or the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication is an L-protein, or the protease is fused to the N-terminal end of an L-protein. The two cleavage sites for said protease (and the optional linkers) on either side are preferably different from each other. The protease having a cleavage site on either side may further have a linker on one or both side, either flanking the cleavage site on one or both sides or alternatively between the protease and the one or more cleavage site.

The term polymerase cofactor refers to an essential component of the RNA polymerase transcription and replication complex. In VSV the RdRp complex comprises the large protein (L-protein) acting as the RdRp and the phosphoprotein (P-protein). The P-protein has two domains, the first being involved in transcription and the second in replication. It typically binds the viral ribonucleocapsid and positions the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase on the templates.",

The Nyamaviridae comprise a further polymerase cofactor, the X-protein, in addition to the P-protein. Thus examples for a functional equivalent of the P-protein are the X/P-protein in Bornoviridae, the VP35-protein in Filoviridae, the P/V/C-protein in Paramyxovirinae and the X-protein in Nyamaviridae.",

Preferably the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication is a polymerase, e.g. the L-protein. Without being bound by theory, as transcription of the viral genes occurs in sequential order from a single promoter at the 3\u2032 end of the genome resulting in decreasing amounts of each transcript, modifications at the L-protein being last in the genome results in less attenuation compared to modifications in other proteins.",

The protease inactivates the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication with at least a cleavage site for said protease at an intramolecular location, whereas at the intermolecular location the protease activates the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. This refers to the protease in its active state and in the absence of a protein inhibitor for said protease. Thus, the protease also regulates viral transcription and/or replication. The term \u201ccleavage site for said protease\u201d refers to a consensus amino acid sequence that serves as a substrate for proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide. Cleavage sites for the respective proteases are known in the art.",
                                "In one embodiment the protease is an autocatalytic protease or the protease acts as an autocatalytic proteases. A protease acts as an autocatalytic protease means that the protease is autocatalytically active, i.e., it mediates cis-cleavage. Typically an autocatalytically active protease also mediates trans-cleavage, i.e., in a different polypeptide comprising the respective cleavage site, in addition to cis-cleavage. Mediating cis-cleavage may be an inherent property of the protease (autocatalytic protease). For example the protease is flanked by one or more cleavage site(s). The protease therefore mediates cleavage of the polypeptide comprising the protease. In specific cases the protease may be released from a polyprotein by autocatalytic cleavage. A protease may also become autocatalytically active by incorporation of one or two cleavage site(s) at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the protease. Thus, a protease acting as an autocatalytic protease or a protease that is catalytically active may also be generated by cloning the respective cleavage site in close proximity to the protease (not naturally expressing the cleavage site on the same polypeptide), such that the recombinant protease has a N-terminal and/or a C-terminal cleavage site. Preferably the protease is framed by a cleavage site for said protease on either side. Thus, the protease has two cleavage sites for said protease, one on the N-terminal side and one on the C-terminal side of the protease. An autocatalytic protease or a protease that acts as an autocatalytic protease is preferred for the aspect relating to the ON-switch (the addition of a protease inhibitor \u201cswitches on\u201d the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication) as well as the aspect relating to the OFF-switch (the addition of a protease inhibitor \u201cswitches off\u201d the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication). However, in the aspect relating to the ON-switch, the insert at the intramolecular insertion site may comprise only the cleavage site for said protease, while the protease may be provided in trans, i.e., as a separate polypeptide preferably encoded by the RNA virus. Therefore, the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication comprises an insert at an intramolecular insertion site comprising at least the cleavage site for said protease, preferably the protease and the cleavage site for said protease. Thus, in case the insert at the intramolecular insertion site comprising only the cleavage site for said protease, the protease is provided in trans.",
                                "Further the protease or autocatalytic protease may be any protease, particularly a viral protease, a prokaryotic protease or a eukaryotic protease, particularly a viral or a eukaryotic protease. The protease used in the RNA virus according to the invention is a heterologous protease, i.e., a protease not endogenous to the virus. In one embodiment the protease is a viral protease, such as the protease is from HCV or HIV. The person skilled in the art will understand that proteases suitable in the context of the present invention are highly specific, i.e., have a restricted set of unique and rare substrate sequences, and further have a specific inhibitor available. The availability of a specific inhibitor allows for conditional regulation of the RNA virus. The protease inhibitor inhibits the proteolytic activity of the protease, wherein inhibits means that the protease shows at least 80% inhibition, at least 90% inhibition, at least 95% inhibition, at least 99% inhibition and preferably 100% inhibition compared to the protease in the absence of the inhibitor. Preferably, the inhibitor is used at a dose corresponding to a therapeutic serum concentration.",
                                "The protease inhibitor should be specific for the protease and suitable for in vivo use, i.e., being safe, bioavailable and active in vivo, such as following oral or parenteral administration to a subject, preferably a human subject. Viral proteases are advantageous as they are common targets for antiviral drugs and hence a number of protease inhibitors inhibiting viral proteases have been approved and tested to be safe in humans. For example, for the human immune deficiency (HIV) protease, various well-characterized protease inhibitors are available and allow regulation of the system with desired kinetics. Examples of suitable HIV protease inhibitors are, without being limited thereto, e.g., indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenevir, atazanavir, tipranavir and darunavir. Human proteases are advantageous as they are endogenous proteins to human patients and hence do not elicit an immune response. Examples for suitable human proteases, without being limited thereto, are caspases and metalloproteinases. Examples of suitable human protease inhibitors are, without being limited thereto, e.g. caspase inhibitors emricasan and nivocasan; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat and tanomastat, and ecaliximab.",

Examples for a protease that is active only as a dimer is the HIV protease used in the Examples. As explained for the HIV-1 protease, single-chain dimers are preferably codon-optimized to avoid homology between the first and second protease. This reduces the risk of \u201ccopy-choice\u201d recombination events as previously described in VSV (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011), in which the viral polymerase, the L-protein, can switch between templates and skip sequence stretches. \u201cCopy-choice\u201d occurs when the polymerase is guided by sequence homology of the nascent RNA strand with the newly chosen template. Preferably the protease is autocatalytically active, i.e., it mediates cis-cleavage. In one embodiment the protease is the HIV-1 protease, preferably a single chain dimer of the HIV-1 protease (e.g., a single chain dimer of the HIV-1 protease having the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5). Suitable HIV-1 protease inhibitors are, without being limited thereto, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenevir, atazanavir, tipranavir or darunavir, preferably amprenavir, saquinavir or indinavir. In another embodiment the protease is the HCV protease NS3 and suitable NS3 inhibitors are, without being limited thereto, boceprevir, telaprevir, asunaprevir, ciluprevir, feldaprevir, vaniprevir, narlaprevir, simeprevir or danoprevir, preferably vaniprevir, narlaprevir, simeprevir or danoprevir.",

                                "The insert at the intramolecular insertion site of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication does not affect activity of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. Activity of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication may be assessed by detecting viral reporter gene expression, TCID50 replication assays or MTT killing assays (see FIG. 13C), preferably using a TCID50 replication assay. Wherein the modified protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication carrying an insert at the intramolecular site may be expressed by the single-stranded RNA virus or may be expressed in trans on a plasmid together with a single-stranded RNA virus deficient in said protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. The insert at the intramolecular insertion site of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription or replication is considered not to affect activity of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication if the activity of the protein and hence viral replication as measured, e.g., by TCID50, provides titers of no more than 2 log lower titers, preferably no more than 1.5 log lower titers, more preferably no more than 1 log lower titers and more preferably equal titers compared to a recombinant single-stranded RNA virus without the insert at the intramolecular insertion site (control) and in case of a protease at the intramolecular insertion site in the presence of a protease inhibitor in the control and the test sample.",
                                "In the single-stranded RNA virus at least the cleavage site for said protease, and optionally further the protease, is located within the intramolecular insertion site of the least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication, and the proteolytic cleavage of the protein cleaves the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication at the cleavage site for said protease within the intramolecular insertion site. Cleavage within the intramolecular insertion site inactivates the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication. Thus, cleavage within the intramolecular insertion site of the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication further inhibits viral transcription and/or replication. Consequently, the virus is active in the presence of a specific inhibitor of the protease and inactive in the absence of a specific inhibitor of the protease. The single-stranded RNA virus may further encode at least one heterologous protein, wherein the heterologous protein is expressed if the virus is active in the presence of a specific inhibitor of the protease and is not expressed if the virus is inactive in the absence of a specific inhibitor of the protease. Production of such heterologous protein depends on intact activity of the viral transcription complex. A suitable heterologous protein is a protein such as a therapeutic protein, a reporter or a tumor antigen.",

In the presence of protease inhibitor, the integrity of the viral proteins is preserved and the virus replicates. Without protease inhibitors, the HIV protease dimer is autocatalytically active, cleaving the essential viral proteins upon translation. Analogous to regulatory modules in DNA viruses (e.g. Tet-On), this mechanism is referred to as \u201cprot-ON\u201d in the Examples.",

At the intramolecular location, the protease has a two cleavage sites. Thus, the protease has a cleavage site on either side and optionally a linker on one or both sides. The linker may either flank the cleavage site on one or both sides or alternatively may be located between the protease and the one or more cleavage site. The two cleavage sites for said protease (and the optional linkers) on either side of the protease are preferably different from each other.",

The at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication may be one, two or three proteins essential for viral transcription and/or replication, preferably one or two proteins essential for viral transcription and/or replication. In certain embodiments the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication is the P-protein or a functional equivalent thereof or the L-protein or a combination thereof.",
                                "The codon usage of the flexible linkers and protease dimer has been optimized to avoid homology between the first and second protease. This precaution was taken, since so called \u201ccopy-choice\u201d recombination events in VSV have been described previously (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011), in which the viral polymerase, the L-protein, can switch between templates and also skip sequence stretches. \u201cCopy-choice\u201d occurs preferentially when the polymerase is guided by sequence homology of the nascent RNA strand with the newly chosen template. Furthermore, point mutations arise frequently in RNA viruses, in the case of VSV at a mutation rate of about 1 nucleotide in 10,000. Theoretically, every genome carries one mutation, which leads virologists to refer to the VSV genome (and other RNA virus genomes) not as one sequence, but to a mixture of so called \u201cquasi-species\u201d. Therefore, occurrence of mutations within the HIV protease sequence rendering the proteolytic switch inactive are a real possibility. To avoid such escape mutants or revertant viruses that may lose the conditional ON switch control, the protease module (ON-switch) may be doubled by introducing protease dimers in a first and a second essential VSV protein, such as the P-protein and the L-protein. The protease and the respective cleavage site may be the same in the two proteins essential for viral transcription and/or replication or may be different and hence may be regulated by the same or different protease inhibitors.",

Based on the recently published full structure information on the VSV L-protein (Liang, Li et al. 2015) possible permissive sites were identified and tested, initially with fluorescence proteins and subsequently with the HIV protease dimer.",

Upon proteolytic cleavage, the protease and the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication are separated. The at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication is inactive in the fusion protein and gets activated upon release by proteolytic cleavage (also referred to as proteolytic release). According to the invention, the fusion protein does not comprise an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 30. This sequence functions as a degron in a SMASh tag described by Chung et al.

Thus, within the fusion protein the at least one protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication is functionally inactive.

Thus, loss of the protease leads to a further inactive fusion protein comprising the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication and the further viral protein. In other words, deletion of the protease and the cleavage site(s) for said protease in a revertant or escape mutant would lead to a new non-functional fusion protein comprising the protein essential for viral transcription and/or replication in its inactive state fused to the further viral protein.

Replacing the intergenic region with the protease has the advantage of reducing (in the case of a further viral protein) or of not increasing (in the case of a heterologous protein) the number of intergenic regions and hence reducing the risk of virus attenuation.

The P-protein gene in VSV Indiana was replaced by P196PR2. GFP at position 5 was used as marker gene. P196PR2 with flanking VSV-N and VSV-M sequences was amplified by PCR with sequences lapping over 2 restriction enzyme sites (XbaI and Bst11071) by 30 bp to the full length VSV vector, which was cut with said enzymes. The construct was then generated by Gibson assembly cloning (FIG. 4).",

The 5\u2032 GGSG linker has the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 and the 3\u2032 GGSG linker has the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9. The linker codons were designed manually to avoid homologies of the upstream with the downstream linker. The cleavage sites are located between each protease domain and the linker and have the DNA sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6 and SEQ ID NO: 7). The protease dimer codons were chosen by the interplay of an optimization algorithm and manual adjustments. The optimization process was a compromise between human codon usage and avoidance of homologies between the first and second protease. Overhangs were introduced by Gibson assembly cloning.",
                                "The functionality of the Phosphoprotein-protease construct was first tested with a P expression plasmid (FIG. 2) in which the DNA of P196PR2 as generated by GeneArt was cloned by digestion of vector and insert with XbaI and Bst11071 and then ligated with a T4 ligase. BHK cells were transfected with this P-Prot (P-Protein and protease) construct and infected with a VSV-AP variant. The VSV-AP was equipped with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) as reporter gene. For the function of VSV-AP a working P-protein is necessary, which was provided in trans by the cell expressing P-Prot. In this set-up we could show that the activity of VSV-AP-RFP was directly linked to the presence of protease inhibitor (amprenavir, concentrations 0.1, 1 and 10 \u03bcM). Without protease inhibitor the P-protein was cleaved and no RFP signal detectable."

                                "To generate a regulatable switch to control activity of RNA viruses, we developed a system that incorporates an autocatalytically active protease sequence into genes essential for VSV gene expression and replication (FIG. 1a). In our first ON-switch construct we introduced an HIV protease dimer into the cofactor of the polymerase of VSV, the P-protein (SEQ ID NO: 1), generating VSV-P-prot. The intramolecular insertion site was previously shown to not affect P-protein function (Das et al., J Virol., 2006, 80(13):6368-6377). The HIV protease function requires dimerization. To facilitate instant post-translational proteolytic activity, the gene insertion construct was designed to harbor two copies of the HIV protease (PR) joined by a flexible linker (FIG. 1b, 2) (Krausslich, PNAS, 1991, 88(8): 3213-3217). Flexible linkers (SEQ ID Nos: 8 and 9) were also applied up- and downstream of the protease construct (SEQ ID NO: 5) resulting in a protease dimer with cleavage sites and likers having the coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 to ensure independent function of the proteases from the rest of the fusion protein (Chen et al., Adv Drug Deliv Rev, 2013, 65(10:1357-1369). The codon usage of both protease sequences was a compromise to take into consideration human codon usage and the coordination between the two sequences to avoid sequence homologies to minimize risk for copy-choice events during replication (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, Nat Rev Microbiol, 2011, 9(8):617-626). The resulting amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 29) is shown in FIG. 5. The single chain linked dimer (PR2) was further flanked by corresponding cleavage sites (SEQ ID Nos: 6 and 7) (de Oliveira et al., J Virol, 2003, 77(17):9422-9430) as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 and cloned into the flexible hinge region of the VSV P-protein at position aa196 (P196), which was previously described as a region tolerating functional intramolecular insertion (Das et al. 2006).",

RFP signal in VSV-\u0394P-RFP infected cells was only detectable in the presence of P196PR2 and a specific HIV protease inhibitor (here: amprenavir) (FIG. 3, photographs B1-B3). Absence of protease inhibitor resulted in lack of viral gene expression and virus replication (FIG. 3, photographs A1-A3) indicating P196PR2 maintains essential viral P-protein function and can be controlled via inhibition of the proteolytic on-switch.",

PCR amplification and sequencing confirmed the correct integration of the P196PR2 construct into the VSV genome (FIG. 6A). Infection of BHK cells with VSV-P-prot resulted in strong GFP signal within 24 hours in the presence but not in the absence of amprenavir (10 \u03bcM) indicating the supplied protease inhibition controlled gene expression of VSV-P-prot (FIG. 6B). Conversely, viral replication observed by virus plaque formation of VSV-P-prot was also found to be protease inhibitor-dependent (FIG. 6C).

In line with the amprenavir effect, both inhibitors facilitated viral gene expression (GFP signal) and viral replication (plaque formation) (FIG. 7) confirming the universal targetability of the HIV protease-based VSV on-switch system. Also lopinavir (10 \u03bcM) and other HIV protease inhibitors were shown to regulate VSV-P-prot (data not shown).",

Additionally, a dose response study was performed to address whether the amprenavir-controlled activity of VSV-P-prot is dose dependent. As discussed before, the effect of amprenavir on both viral gene expression (GFP) and viral replication (TCID50 replication assay) was assessed. BHK cells were infected with an MOI of 1 and viral infection assessed after 24 hours (FIG. 8A). A single step growth curved revealed that VSV-Pprot activity started at amprenavir doses of 100 nM, reached a plateau of maximum activity at a dose range between 3 and 100 \u03bcM and deteriorated at higher doses (FIG. 8B). Viral replication of standard recombinant VSV without P-prot control mechanism resulted in 1.5 log higher titers and was not affected by amprenavir doses up to 30 \u03bcM, indicating that amprenavir does not control VSV replication in the absence of the P-prot switch. The replication curve revealed a slight attenuation of VSV-P-prot over VSV.",

                                "VSV is known for pronounced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals once entered into the CNS space. The VSV glycoprotein shows a strong affinity to neurons and both anterograde and retrograde axonal spread have been described. To address to what extend neurotoxicity of VSV-P-prot is abrogated compared to normal VSV, we employed direct stereotactic injection into the mouse striatum. Intracranial instillation of wildtype-based VSV-dsRed (2\u00d7105 TCID50 in 2 \u03bcl) led to profound signs of neurotoxicity (FIG. 9A) expressed as hind-limb paralysis, lack of coordination, hunched position, and severe weight drop (FIG. 9C) starting within 2 days post injection. All mice had to be euthanized within 4 days for humane reason (FIG. 9B). In stark contrast, injection of the brain with VSV-P-prot at the same dose resulted in no signs of neurotoxicity. Mice also showed no brain-related adverse signs after intracranial VSV-P-prot injection when treated simultaneously with amprenavir and ritonavir (100 \u03bcM amprenavir, 25 \u03bcM ritonavir (inhibits degradation of APV) in 100 \u03bcl PBS i.p., administered two times a day for 10 days) (FIG. 9A-C). To study potential intracranial spread after stereotactic injection, brains were harvested at day of toxicity-related euthanasia (VSV-dsRed) or at day 10 past VSV-P-prot inoculation. Histological fluorescence analysis of coronal brain sections revealed extended spread of VSV-dsRed expressing red fluorescence. Virus infection was found throughout the striatum, subcortical areas and hypothalamus (bilateral). In contrast, GFP expression from VSV-P-prot was highly restricted to the immediate lining of the injection needle track without any signs of intracranial spread of VSV-P-prot regardless of whether amprenavir was systemically applied or not (FIG. 9D). These data confirm that VSV-P-prot is not associated with the neurotoxicity and intracranial spread typical for VSV.",
                                "Thus, the ligand-dependent virus activity was also confirmed in vivo by complete abrogation of neurotoxicity and intracranial spread associated with the parental VSV. As amprenavir does not cross the blood brain barrier, systemic application of the compound did not confer virus activity and neurotoxicity was absent despite a systemically present ON system.",

                                "RNA viruses are prone to frequent mutations, in the case of VSV at a mutation rate of about 1 in 10,000 (Steinhauer and Holland 1986, Steinhauer, de la Torre et al. 1989). To test whether the regulatable viral control ON switch of VSV-P-prot remains functionally stable throughout a number of viral replication rounds, we employed in-vitro serial virus passage in optimal (10 \u03bcM) and suboptimal (1 \u03bcM) amprenavir conditions. After each passage protease inhibitor dependency was assessed by GFP expression after transferring a sample of the supernatant onto parallel dishes incubated without amprenavir. After 20 passages (P20), no amprenavir escape virus variants could be observed (FIG. 10A). To confirm the genomic integrity of VSV-P-prot, viral genomic RNA collected from passage P20 from the suboptimal amprenavir-treated virus propagation was purified, reverse transcribed and a PCR performed on the insert P-196PR2. A VSV variant without protease insertion was used as negative control. We found the P-196PR2 and the protease negative P-protein PCR fragments to be at their expected sizes (FIG. 10B). Subsequent sequencing of the P-prot site and alignment comparison with the respective sequence in the parental plasmid construct (SEQ ID NO: 4) revealed one mutation (protease 2: nucleotide G23A; amino acid R8K) in the construct, which did not render the construct non-functional. It remains to be seen if this mutation is functionally fully silent, reflects an adaptation to low APV concentration or an exchange of a rare codon (R: 7%) to a frequent codon (K: 74%).",

                                "In order to test whether the virus-controlling autocatalytically active protease approach could also function when inserted in an alternative essential VSV protein, we sought to generate a VSV-L-prot. As stable and unattenuated intramolecular insertions have not been successfully reported to date (Ruedas and Perrault, J Virol, 2009, 83(23):12241-12252; Ruedas and Perrault, J Virol, 2014, 88(24): 14458-14466), we first set out to study the ability of VSV L-protein to tolerate an insertion of a reporter gene (mCherry) or not. We used a structure-guided approach to identify five different L-protein insertion sites (amino acid position CD1506, CD1537, MT1603, MT1620 and MT1889 of the L-protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 28) for mCherry, which we deemed plausible because they were located at the surface and in flexible loops, which should minimize the possibility of steric clashes (FIG. 11A, C). We also avoided insertion sites within alpha-helices and beta-sheets to conserve structural integrity of the L-protein. FIG. 11D depicts a model of the insertion at MT1620, which resulted in a replication competent virus as explained below. To screen the proposed in silico designed structure predictions for candidate insertion sites, VSV L-protein expression vectors with insertions at CD1506, CD1537, MT1603, MT1620 and MT1889 were generated. After transfection of these five constructs in HEK cells, infection with a propagation-incompetent VSV-GFP-\u0394L virus, coding for eGFP as reporter, was performed. In this screening all sites showed mCherry signal, but only two sites (CD1506, MT1620) showed eGFP signal, indicating transcriptional activity of L-mCherry fusion protein (FIG. 12A). Thus, every insertion site allows correct mCherry folding, although with varying efficiency, but only two insertions retain polymerase activity. To test the eGFP positive clones for viral replication competency, we chose to clone these sites (CD1506, MT1620) in a full VSV genome. Each site was cloned into two VSV backbones, one with eGFP as reporter at fifth position in the genome, the other without eGFP. Neither of the VSV variants with the CD1506 construct could be rescued, even after multiple attempts. In contrast, VSV-L-MT1620 and VSV-GFP-L-MT1620 virus rescue yielded replication competent viruses. This was confirmed by the cytopathic effect and fluorescent signal (FIG. 12B). As expected, VSV-eGFP-L-MT1620-mCherry showed fluorescent signals in both FITC (green) and TRITC (red) channels, and VSV-L-MT1620-mCherry only in TRITC channel. mCherry flanked by a linker on each side has the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11. VSV-L-MT1620-mWasabi showed green fluorescence in the FITC channel (FIG. 12B). The protein mWasabi is likewise flanked by a linker on each side and is encoded by the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12. To verify mCherry presence at protein level we performed immunoblots with an mCherry specific antibody. BHK-21 cells were infected with VSV, VSV-GFP, VSV-L-MT1620-mCherry and VSV-GFP-L-MT1620-mCherry. As a positive control, a vector containing only mCherry was transfected in BHK-21 cells. mCherry inside L-protein displayed a signal at high molecular weight (expected at 267 kDa), in accordance with the production of the L-mCherry fusion protein after viral infection (FIG. 12C).",

                                "To assess the replication capability and potential attenuation of VSV-L-insert compared to wild-type based VSV, plaque assays were performed to illustrate plaque size (FIG. 13A) and TCID50 assay was performed to quantify virus replication (FIG. 13B). Both tests revealed an attenuation of VSV-L-insert compared to wildtype VSV, with a reduction in virus replication titers of about 1-2 logs. In addition, MTT viability assays were performed to assess the ability of VSV-L-insert to induce cell killing in BHK cells in the presence or absence of interferon compared to VSV. In the absence of IFN, virus cytotoxicity after VSV-L-insert infection was comparable to VSV infection (FIG. 13C). In the presence of IFN, the two L-MT1620-mCherry VSV variants showed a stronger IFN-dependency and consequently a slightly reduced killing compared to VSV and VSV-GFP (FIG. 13C; data for GFP variants not shown) corroborating the finding that insertions of mCherry at position MT1620 lead to mild attenuation compared to wild-type VSV, without significantly impairing its replicative or cytolytic potential.",

VSV-L-prot activity started at amprenavir doses of 100 nM and reached a maximum activity at a dose of 30 \u03bcM. Higher amprenavir concentrations were not tested for L-prot, since they had shown to decrease titers by being toxic for cells in our previous VSV-P-prot studies.

In the presence of protease inhibitor, the integrity of the viral proteins was preserved and the viruses could replicate. Without protease inhibitors, the HIV protease dimer was autocatalytically active, cleaving the essential viral proteins upon translation. Analogous to regulatory modules in DNA viruses (e.g. Tet-On), we termed this mechanism \u201cprot-ON\u201d.",
                                "We optimized the codon usage of the flexible linkers and protease dimer to avoid homology between the first and second protease. This precaution was taken, since so called \u201ccopy-choice\u201d recombination events in VSV have been described previously (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011), in which the viral polymerase, the L-protein, can switch between templates and also skip sequence stretches. \u201cCopy-choice\u201d occurs preferentially when the polymerase is guided by sequence homology of the nascent RNA strand with the newly chosen template. Furthermore, point mutations arise frequently in RNA viruses, in the case of VSV at a mutation rate of about 1 nucleotide in 10,000. Theoretically, every genome carries one mutation, which leads virologists to refer to the VSV genome (and other RNA virus genomes) not as one sequence, but to a mixture of so called \u201cquasi-species\u201d. Therefore, occurrence of mutations within the HIV protease sequence rendering the proteolytic switch inactive are a real possibility. To avoid such escape mutants or revertant viruses that may lose the conditional ON switch control, we doubled the protease module (ON-switch) by introducing protease dimers in a second essential VSV protein the P-protein and the L-protein.",

However, it is preferred to control the replication machinery of VSV directly, since regulation of the M-protein would still allow the virus to undergo replication, possibly facilitating escape mutations. Insertion sites within the L-protein have been described, but the resulting viruses were temperature sensitive and instable after passage (Ruedas and Perrault 2009, Ruedas and Perrault 2014). In contrast, we were able to generate functional insertions with initially fluorescence proteins and subsequently the HIV protease dimer. Both P-prot and L-prot responded to the presence of every HIV protease inhibitor we tested and replicated in a compound dose-dependent fashion.

                                "Following the generation of a protease-based ON-switch we also generated a VSV variant VSV-Prot-Off that can be switched off. Using the same HIV protease mediated autocatalytic switch system, a location change of the insertion from INTRA- to INTER-molecular site results in a reversal of direction from virus promoting to virus stopping control. For this OFF-switch, the protease dimer with a variant codon optimization was inserted into the VSV genome to create a fusion protein of GFP, the protease dimer and the viral polymerase L. This large fusion protein with the protease dimer fused to the N-terminus of the L protein is expected to be functionally inactive, but to be activated by proteolytic liberation of L protein in the absence of protease inhibitor. In this OFF construct we replaced an intergenic region of VSV with the HIV protease flanked by its cleavage sites. Intergenic regions play a crucial part in generating multiple proteins from one RNA strand. We chose the intergenic region between the non-essential reporter protein GFP and the L-protein (FIG. 17A) in VSV-GFP and generated two viruses. The first one carried flexible linker regions surrounding the HIV protease dimer construct (SEQ ID NO: 16) and a second one having no regions surrounding the HIV protease dimer construct (SEQ ID NO: 17). It would be advantageous to avoid flexible linker regions, because they would remain as C-terminal tag on GFP and N-terminal tag on the L-protein, after the HIV protease dimer has cleaved its recognition sequence. However, the two constructs differ only slightly in their replicative capacity. Adding of amprenavir (10 \u03bcM) resulted in stop of virus activity both at the level of viral transgene expression (GFP) as well as virus replication (plaque assays) (FIG. 18A). An additional unique safety feature has been added to this system. In theory, a potential loss of the protease insert could result in viral progeny escaping the OFF switch control. We therefore put the protease OFF switch in place of the intergenic region, so that an insert loss would come with a penalty of forming a fusion protein of two neighboring VSV proteins or in this case a VSV protein with GFP resulting in a dysfunctional virus.",
                                "To test genomic integrity of VSV-GFP-Prot-L, viral genomic RNA was purified, reverse transcribed and a PCR performed on GFP-Prot-L.

The mutations are not described as typical protease inhibitor resistance mutations and do not interfere with regulation by protease inhibitors. Possibly these mutations made the protease more active when fused between GFP and L.",

                                "Like with the two prot-ON constructs, a dose response study was performed to address whether the amprenavir-controlled activity of VSV-GFP-Prot-L (VSV-Prot-Off) is dose dependent. As discussed before, the effect of amprenavir on both viral gene expression (GFP) and viral replication (TCID50 replication assay) was assessed (FIGS. 19 A and B). In the absence of protease inhibitors, VSV-GFP-Prot-L activity was unattenuated compared to normal VSV. VSV-GFP-Prot-L activity was high at low amprenavir concentrations (0-300 nM) and started to decline at 1 \u03bcM. We also tested whether VSV-GFP-Prot-L would respond to other protease inhibitors than amprenavir. 10 \u03bcM saquinavir treatment resulted in even stronger inhibition of virus replication than amprenavir (FIG. 19B). This was further confirmed in FIG. 19 C using saquinavir concentrations of 0-30 \u03bcM). Further a single step replication kinetic was determined by seeding 105 BHK cells per well in 12-Well plates and infected at an MOI of 3 with VSV-Prot-Off or VSV-GFP (FIG. 19D). One hour after infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 500 \u03bcl GMEM until indicated time points. For starting values, i.e. 0-hour time points, the 500 \u03bcl GMEM were collected immediately. VSV-Prot-Off showed no attenuation compared to VSV-GFP (FIG. 19D).",
                                "Thus, using the same autoproteolytic system as in the \u201cprot-ON\u201d constructs but in a functionally different genome location, we also developed the reversal mechanism of protease-dependent OFF regulation, which works by the replacement of an intergenic region with the HIV protease dimer. In this construct the protease must be active to separate two viral proteins, similar as it does in HIV. Adding protease inhibitor in this construct leads to non-functional fusion proteins (polyproteins), which inhibit viral activity. Continuing the Tet-On/Tet-Off analogy, we termed this construct \u201cprot-Off\u201d. For optimal virus activity control, both ON and OFF switches were designed to interfere with an early stage of virus propagation by modulating proteins of the viral replication/transcription machinery. Hence our approach expands and potentially bests the current methods of RNA virus regulation.",
                                "The replacement of the intergenic region in the Prot-Off viruses has been exemplified between a non-essential reporter protein, GFP, and the essential L-protein, however, the Prot-Off may equally replace an intergenic region that links an essential viral protein with a further viral protein, thereby making the virus safer, since deletion of the protease construct would result in a non-functional fusion protein. Classical resistance mutations, as they occur in HIV under continuous treatment with protease inhibitors could theoretically still occur in the Prot-OFF construct. However, the broad spectrum of available protease inhibitors could compensate for such point mutations.",

Six- to eight-week old female athymic nude mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were housed in a BL2 facility with a 12-hour light/dark cycle with unrestricted access to food and water. For subcutaneous xenografts, 100 \u03bcl human U87 glioblastoma cell suspension containing 2\u00d7106 cells were injected into the right flanks of nude mice. After an engraftment period, U87 xenografts with a median volume of 0.1 cm3 were intratumorally injected with a single dose of 30 \u03bcl containing 107 virus (titrated via TCID50) of VSV-Pprot-Luc or control buffer. Protease inhibitor treatment (50 \u03bcl intraperitoneal of 0.8 mM APV+0.2 mM RTV every 12 hours in drug vehicle containing 10% DMSO, 40% PEG300, 5% Tween80 and 45% PBS) was initiated one hour before virus application. Ritonavir serves as a blocker of degradation enzymes (Cyp family) in vivo. It augments the concentration of the other PI. RTV is also used as additive in the treatment of HIV for exactly that purpose. Additionally it blocks p-glycoproteins and therefore increases the concentration of the other PI in the brain. Bioluminescence in vivo imaging of luciferase expressing VSV variants was performed using an IVIS\u00ae Lumina II (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) system as described by Urbiola C. et al., (int. J. Cancer, 2018, 148: 1786-1796). FIG. 20A shows representative bioluminescence images from 8 days after virus injection. At day 8, luminescence is only detected in mice that have been treated with protease inhibitor. This is also confirmed by the bioluminescence imaging (BLI) quantified luciferase signal data shown in FIG. 20B. In the absence of protease inhibitor the luciferase signal is maximal between days 2 to 3 and then starts to decline. The initial bioluminescence signal independent of protease inhibitor application can be explained by the fact that the virus preparation contained amprenavir to block autoproteolysis during virus production and storage. Without further protease inhibitor injections, the bioluminescence signal decreased significantly after 3 days (FIG. 20B), followed by loss of tumor control (data not shown). By contrast, in the presence of protease inhibitor the luciferase signal plateaued for 17 days at an overall much higher level (FIG. 20B) and tumors were controlled in size (data not shown). These data demonstrates in vivo functionality of the ON switch construct, allowing virus replication and expression of a transgene, such as the reporter gene luciferase as used in this experiment or a therapeutic protein, in the presence of a protease inhibitor.",

                                "Due to strong toxicity of systemically applied IL12, membrane anchored variants have been developed to retain IL12 at desired sites (Poutou, J. et al., Gene Therapy (2015) 22, 696-706). We applied this principle to gain several advantages over soluble IL12 constructs. First, as has been described by Poutou et al., locally produced IL12 decreases systemic toxicity. Nevertheless, toxicity is not abrogated completely; therefore, further regulation is still desirable. By fusing IL12 with a transmembrane domain of CD4 directly to the VSV polymerase (L protein) as shown in FIG. 27, both viral replication and transgene expression can be decreased through the presence of protease inhibitors. Furthermore, in the context of virus escape mutants, fusing the possibly toxic transgene to the protease dimer in the regulatory virus OFF-switch variant would force the virus to delete both transgene and regulatory switch at once. Deletion of only the switch would still result in a non-functional transgene-polymerase fusion protein. Additionally, by combining both transgene and OFF-switch, coding capacity the virus is economized. Typically, genes are added to the VSV genome by further intergenic regions. VSV genes are transcribed in a continuous gradient, whereby every intergenic region reduces the expression of the downstream transcript. Therefore, introduction of a transgene without the need for an extra intergenic region could reduce virus attenuation.",
                                "Previous Prot-Off constructs showed that a flexible linker between the HIV protease dimer and the polymerase result both in lower titers in the absence of protease inhibitors and a slightly less stringent regulation. Residual linker after protease cleavage attached to the N-terminus of the polymerase could be an explanation for the first phenomenon. A flexible linker between the HIV protease and the polymerase could furthermore allow some activity due to less stringent sterical hindrance, possibly resulting in less stringent regulation. Transmembrane anchored IL12 virus variants were therefore designed with either a flexible linker only between IL12-TM and the HIV protease dimer (forward linker\u2014fl) or without any linker flanking the protease (without linker\u2014w/ol). We designed the forward linker construct to provide some additional space between the CD4 membrane anchor and the protease-polymerase fusion protein. The transmembrane domain has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 31 (encoded by nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 32) and is separated from IL12 encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 33 by a linker having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 34 (encoded by nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 35).",

Virus titers were determined via TCID50 (FIG. 28A). Furthermore, unfiltered supernatants were tested for IL12 in an ELISA.

Indeed, maximal IL12 concentrations were lower in PI-negative control samples compared to secreted IL12 (compare FIG. 28B with FIGS. 24B and 25B).
