    "date": "2021-11-11",
    "abstract": "This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.",

                "Deep learning has witnessed an explosion of architectures of continuously growing capability and capacity [33,25,57]. Aided by the rapid gains in hardware, models today can easily overfit one million images [13] and begin to demand hundreds of millions of-often publicly inaccessible-labeled images [16].",
                "This appetite for data has been successfully addressed in natural language processing (NLP) by self-supervised pretraining. The solutions, based on autoregressive language modeling in GPT [47,48,4] and masked autoencoding in BERT [14], are conceptually simple: they remove a portion of the data and learn to predict the removed content. These methods now enable training of generalizable NLP models containing over one hundred billion parameters [4].",
                "The idea of masked autoencoders, a form of more general denoising autoencoders [58], is natural and applicable in computer vision as well. Indeed, closely related research ) is masked out. The encoder is applied to the small subset of visible patches. Mask tokens are introduced after the encoder, and the full set of encoded patches and mask tokens is processed by a small decoder that reconstructs the original image in pixels. After pre-training, the decoder is discarded and the encoder is applied to uncorrupted images (full sets of patches) for recognition tasks.",
                "in vision [59,46] preceded BERT. However, despite significant interest in this idea following the success of BERT, progress of autoencoding methods in vision lags behind NLP. We ask: what makes masked autoencoding different between vision and language?",
                "We attempt to answer this question from the following perspectives: (i) Until recently, architectures were different. In vision, convolutional networks [34] were dominant over the last decade [33]. Convolutions typically operate on regular grids and it is not straightforward to integrate 'indicators' such as mask tokens [14] or positional embeddings [57] into convolutional networks. This architectural gap, however, has been addressed with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) [16] and should no longer present an obstacle.",
                "(ii) Information density is different between language and vision. Languages are human-generated signals that are highly semantic and information-dense. When training a model to predict only a few missing words per sentence, this task appears to induce sophisticated language understanding. Images, on the contrary, are natural signals with heavy spatial redundancy-e.g., a missing patch can be recovered from neighboring patches with little high-level un-Figure 2. Example results on ImageNet validation images. For each triplet, we show the masked image (left), our MAE reconstruction \u2020 (middle), and the ground-truth (right). The masking ratio is 80%, leaving only 39 out of 196 patches. More examples are in the appendix. \u2020 As no loss is computed on visible patches, the model output on visible patches is qualitatively worse. One can simply overlay the output with the visible patches to improve visual quality. We intentionally opt not to do this, so we can more comprehensively demonstrate the method's behavior. derstanding of parts, objects, and scenes. To overcome this difference and encourage learning useful features, we show that a simple strategy works well in computer vision: masking a very high portion of random patches. This strategy largely reduces redundancy and creates a challenging selfsupervisory task that requires holistic understanding beyond low-level image statistics. To get a qualitative sense of our reconstruction task, see Figures 234.",
                "(iii) The autoencoder's decoder, which maps the latent representation back to the input, plays a different role between reconstructing text and images. In vision, the decoder reconstructs pixels, hence its output is of a lower semantic level than common recognition tasks. This is in contrast to language, where the decoder predicts missing words that contain rich semantic information. While in BERT the decoder can be trivial (an MLP) [14], we found that for images, the decoder design plays a key role in determining the semantic level of the learned latent representations.",
                "Driven by this analysis, we present a simple, effective, and scalable form of a masked autoencoder (MAE) for visual representation learning. Our MAE masks random patches from the input image and reconstructs the missing patches in the pixel space. It has an asymmetric encoderdecoder design. Our encoder operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), and our decoder is lightweight and reconstructs the input from the latent representation along with mask tokens (Figure 1). Shifting the mask tokens to the small decoder in our asymmetric encoder-decoder results in a large reduction in computation. Under this design, a very high masking ratio (e.g., 75%) can achieve a win-win scenario: it optimizes accuracy while allowing the encoder to process only a small portion (e.g., 25%) of patches. This can reduce overall pre-training time by 3\u00d7 or more and likewise reduce memory consumption, enabling us to easily scale our MAE to large models.",
                "Our MAE learns very high-capacity models that generalize well. With MAE pre-training, we can train datahungry models like ViT-Large/-Huge [16] on ImageNet-1K with improved generalization performance. With a vanilla ViT-Huge model, we achieve 87.8% accuracy when finetuned on ImageNet-1K. This outperforms all previous results that use only ImageNet-1K data. We also evaluate transfer learning on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. In these tasks, our pre-training achieves better results than its supervised pre-training counterparts, and more importantly, we observe significant gains by scaling up models. These observations are aligned with those witnessed in self-supervised pre-training in NLP [14,47,48,4] and we hope that they will enable our field to explore a similar trajectory. original mask 75% mask 85% mask 95%",

For example, PCA and k-means are autoencoders [29]. Denoising autoencoders (DAE) [58] are a class of autoencoders that corrupt an input signal and learn to reconstruct the original, uncorrupted signal. A series of methods can be thought of as a generalized DAE under different corruptions, e.g., masking pixels [59,46,6] or removing color channels [70].",

Recently, contrastive learning [3,22] has been popular, e.g., [62,43,23,7], which models image similarity and dissimilarity (or only similarity [21,8]) between two or more views. Contrastive and related methods strongly depend on data augmentation [7,21,8]. Autoencoding pursues a conceptually different direction, and it exhibits different behaviors as we will present."

Like all autoencoders, our approach has an encoder that maps the observed signal to a latent representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the original signal from the latent representation. Unlike classical autoencoders, we adopt an asymmetric design that allows the encoder to operate only on the partial, observed signal (without mask tokens) and a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the full signal from the latent representation and mask tokens. Figure 1 illustrates the idea, introduced next.",
                "Masking. Following ViT [16], we divide an image into regular non-overlapping patches. Then we sample a subset of patches and mask (i.e., remove) the remaining ones. Our sampling strategy is straightforward: we sample random patches without replacement, following a uniform distribution. We simply refer to this as \"random sampling\".",
                "Random sampling with a high masking ratio (i.e., the ratio of removed patches) largely eliminates redundancy, thus creating a task that cannot be easily solved by extrapolation from visible neighboring patches (see Figures 234). The uniform distribution prevents a potential center bias (i.e., more masked patches near the image center). Finally, the highly sparse input creates an opportunity for designing an efficient encoder, introduced next. MAE encoder. Our encoder is a ViT [16] but applied only on visible, unmasked patches. Just as in a standard ViT, our encoder embeds patches by a linear projection with added positional embeddings, and then processes the resulting set via a series of Transformer blocks. However, our encoder only operates on a small subset (e.g., 25%) of the full set. Masked patches are removed; no mask tokens are used. This allows us to train very large encoders with only a fraction of compute and memory. The full set is handled by a lightweight decoder, described next.",
                "MAE decoder. The input to the MAE decoder is the full set of tokens consisting of (i) encoded visible patches, and (ii) mask tokens. See Figure 1. Each mask token [14] is a shared, learned vector that indicates the presence of a miss-ing patch to be predicted. We add positional embeddings to all tokens in this full set; without this, mask tokens would have no information about their location in the image. The decoder has another series of Transformer blocks.",
                "The MAE decoder is only used during pre-training to perform the image reconstruction task (only the encoder is used to produce image representations for recognition). Therefore, the decoder architecture can be flexibly designed in a manner that is independent of the encoder design. We experiment with very small decoders, narrower and shallower than the encoder. For example, our default decoder has <10% computation per token vs. the encoder. With this asymmetrical design, the full set of tokens are only processed by the lightweight decoder, which significantly reduces pre-training time.",
                "Reconstruction target. Our MAE reconstructs the input by predicting the pixel values for each masked patch. Each element in the decoder's output is a vector of pixel values representing a patch. The last layer of the decoder is a linear projection whose number of output channels equals the number of pixel values in a patch. The decoder's output is reshaped to form a reconstructed image. Our loss function computes the mean squared error (MSE) between the reconstructed and original images in the pixel space. We compute the loss only on masked patches, similar to BERT [14]. 1   We also study a variant whose reconstruction target is the normalized pixel values of each masked patch. Specifically, we compute the mean and standard deviation of all pixels in a patch and use them to normalize this patch. Using normalized pixels as the reconstruction target improves representation quality in our experiments.",
                "Simple implementation. Our MAE pre-training can be implemented efficiently, and importantly, does not require any specialized sparse operations. First we generate a token for every input patch (by linear projection with an added positional embedding). Next we randomly shuffle the list of tokens and remove the last portion of the list, based on the masking ratio. This process produces a small subset of tokens for the encoder and is equivalent to sampling patches without replacement. After encoding, we append a list of mask tokens to the list of encoded patches, and unshuffle this full list (inverting the random shuffle operation) to align all tokens with their targets. The decoder is applied to this full list (with positional embeddings added). As noted, no sparse operations are needed. This simple implementation introduces negligible overhead as the shuffling and unshuffling operations are fast. 1 Computing the loss only on masked patches differs from traditional denoising autoencoders [58] that compute the loss on all pixels. This choice is purely result-driven: computing the loss on all pixels leads to a slight decrease in accuracy (e.g., \u223c0.5%). "

For linear probing, the ac- curacy increases steadily with the masking ratio until the sweet point: the accuracy gap is up to \u223c20% (54.6% vs. 73.5%). For fine-tuning, the results are less sensitive to the ratios, and a wide range of masking ratios (40-80%) work well. All fine-tuning results in Figure 5 are better than training from scratch (82.5%).",
                        "Decoder design. Our MAE decoder can be flexibly designed, as studied in Table 1a and 1b. Table 1a varies the decoder depth (number of Transformer blocks). A sufficiently deep decoder is important for linear probing. This can be explained by the gap between a pixel reconstruction task and a recognition task: the last several layers in an autoencoder are more specialized for reconstruction, but are less relevant for recognition. A reasonably deep decoder can account for the reconstruction specialization, leaving the latent representations at a more abstract level. This design can yield up to 8% improvement in linear probing (Table 1a, 'lin'). However, if fine-tuning is used, the last layers of the encoder can be tuned to adapt to the recognition task. The decoder depth is less influential for improving fine-tuning (Table 1a, 'ft').",
                        "Interestingly, our MAE with a single-block decoder can perform strongly with fine-tuning (84.8%). Note that a single Transformer block is the minimal requirement to propagate information from visible tokens to mask tokens. Such a small decoder can further speed up training.",

As such, while the decoder processes all tokens, it is still a small fraction of the overall compute.  Mask token. An important design of our MAE is to skip the mask token [M] in the encoder and apply it later in the lightweight decoder. Table 1c studies this design.",
                        "If the encoder uses mask tokens, it performs worse: its accuracy drops by 14% in linear probing. In this case, there is a gap between pre-training and deploying: this encoder has a large portion of mask tokens in its input in pretraining, which does not exist in uncorrupted images. This gap may degrade accuracy in deployment. By removing the mask token from the encoder, we constrain the encoder to always see real patches and thus improve accuracy.",
                        "Moreover, by skipping the mask token in the encoder, we greatly reduce training computation. In Table 1c, we reduce the overall training FLOPs by 3.3\u00d7. This leads to a 2.8\u00d7 wall-clock speedup in our implementation (see Table 2). The wall-clock speedup is even bigger (3.5-4.1\u00d7), for a smaller decoder (1-block), a larger encoder (ViT-H), or both. Note that the speedup can be >4\u00d7 for a masking ratio of 75%, partially because the self-attention complexity is quadratic. In addition, memory is greatly reduced, which can enable training even larger models or speeding up more by large-batch training. The time and memory efficiency makes our MAE favorable for training very large models.  1f). Here each output is from an MAE trained with the specified masking strategy.

Using pixels with normalization improves accuracy. This per-patch normalization enhances the contrast locally. In another variant, we perform PCA in the patch space and use the largest PCA coefficients (96 here) as the target. Doing so degrades accuracy. Both experiments suggest that the high-frequency components are useful in our method.",

Specifically for this variant, we use the DALLE pre-trained dVAE [50] as the tokenizer, following [2]. Here the MAE decoder predicts the token indices using cross-entropy loss. This tokenization improves fine-tuning accuracy by 0.4% vs. unnormalized pixels, but has no advantage vs. normalized pixels. It also reduces linear probing accuracy. In \u00a75 we further show that tokenization is not necessary in transfer learning.",
                        "Our pixel-based MAE is much simpler than tokenization. The dVAE tokenizer requires one more pre-training stage, which may depend on extra data (250M images [50]).

Linear probing has been a popular protocol in the past few years; however, it misses the opportunity of pursuing strong but non-linear features-which is indeed a strength of deep learning. As a middle ground, we study a partial fine-tuning protocol: fine-tune the last several layers while freezing the others. This protocol was also used in early works, e.g., [65,70,42].",
                        "Figure 9 shows the results. Notably, fine-tuning only one Transformer block boosts the accuracy significantly from 73.5% to 81.0%. Moreover, if we fine-tune only \"half\" of the last block (i.e., its MLP sub-block), we can get 79.1%, much better than linear probing. This variant is essentially fine-tuning an MLP head. Fine-tuning a few blocks (e.g., 4 or 6) can achieve accuracy close to full fine-tuning.",
                        "In Figure 9 we also compare with MoCo v3 [9], a contrastive method with ViT-L results available. MoCo v3 has higher linear probing accuracy; however, all of its partial fine-tuning results are worse than MAE. The gap is 2.6% when tuning 4 blocks. While the MAE representations are less linearly separable, they are stronger non-linear features and perform well when a non-linear head is tuned. These observations suggest that linear separability is not the sole metric for evaluating representation quality. It has also been observed (e.g., [8]) that linear probing is not well correlated with transfer learning performance, e.g., for object detection. To our knowledge, linear evaluation is not often used in NLP for benchmarking pre-training."

While using dVAE tokens is better than using unnormalized pixels, it is statistically similar to using normalized pixels across all cases we tested.

                "Simple algorithms that scale well are the core of deep learning. In NLP, simple self-supervised learning methods (e.g., [47,14,48,4]) enable benefits from exponentially scaling models. In computer vision, practical pre-training paradigms are dominantly supervised (e.g. [33,51,25,16]) despite progress in self-supervised learning. In this study, we observe on ImageNet and in transfer learning that an autoencoder-a simple self-supervised method similar to techniques in NLP-provides scalable benefits. Selfsupervised learning in vision may now be embarking on a similar trajectory as in NLP.",
                "On the other hand, we note that images and languages are signals of a different nature and this difference must be addressed carefully. Images are merely recorded light without a semantic decomposition into the visual analogue of words. Instead of attempting to remove objects, we remove random patches that most likely do not form a semantic segment. Likewise, our MAE reconstructs pixels, which are not semantic entities. Nevertheless, we observe (e.g., Figure 4) that our MAE infers complex, holistic reconstructions, suggesting it has learned numerous visual concepts, i.e., semantics. We hypothesize that this behavior occurs by way of a rich hidden representation inside the MAE. We hope this perspective will inspire future work.",

The proposed method predicts content based on learned statistics of the training dataset and as such will reflect biases in those data, including ones with negative societal impacts. The model may generate inexistent content. These issues warrant further research and consideration when building upon this work to generate images."

As the MAE encoder and decoder have different width, we adopt a linear projection layer after the encoder to match it. Our MAE adds positional embeddings [57] (the sine-cosine version) to both the encoder and decoder inputs. Our MAE does not use relative position or layer scaling (which are used in the code of [2]).",

Following [9], we disable many common regularization strategies: we do not use mixup [69], cutmix [68], drop path [30], or color jittering, and we set weight decay as zero.",
                "It is a common practice to normalize the classifier input when training a classical linear classifier (e.g., SVM [11]). Similarly, it is beneficial to normalize the pre-trained features when training the linear probing classifier. Following [15], we adopt an extra BatchNorm layer [31] without affine transformation (affine=False). This layer is applied on the pre-trained features produced by the encoder, and is before the linear classifier. We note that the layer does not break the linear property, and it can be absorbed into the linear classifier after training: it is essentially a reparameterized linear classifier. 3 Introducing this layer helps calibrate the feature magnitudes across different variants in our ablations, so that they can use the same setting without further lr search.
