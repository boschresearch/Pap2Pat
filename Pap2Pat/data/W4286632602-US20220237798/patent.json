                        "Ultrasound imaging is a medical imaging technique for imaging organs and soft tissues in a human body. Ultrasound imaging uses real time, non-invasive high frequency sound waves to produce two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and/or four-dimensional (4D) (i.e., real-time/continuous 3D images) images.",
                        "Ultrasound imaging is a valuable, non-invasive tool for diagnosing various medical conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States with 30-40% of adults in the United States having NAFLD. Liver with steatosis (i.e., fat content of more than 5%) may be visualized in ultrasound as being brighter than the neighboring kidney. Hepatorenal index (HRI), defined as the ratio of mean sample value of the liver to renal cortex, is a biomarker used in clinical practice for steatosis grading of NAFLD and is a simple and efficient way of identifying liver steatosis. However, clinicians have high subjectivity in estimating HRI due to lack of guidelines and consensus in the community. In addition, identifying liver and kidney region for calculating HRI is subjective to clinician's skill level, size of the region, anatomical view, depth, ultrasound machine, type of input data, and selection/avoidance of certain anatomical parts. For example, a smaller region of interest (ROI) size often used by clinicians makes HRI very susceptible to variations in kidney anatomy.",

Each neuron of each layer may perform a processing function and pass the processed ultrasound image information to one of a plurality of neurons of a downstream layer for further processing. As an example, neurons of a first layer may learn to recognize edges of structure in the obtained ultrasound image. The neurons of a second layer may learn to recognize shapes based on the detected edges from the first layer. The neurons of a third layer may learn positions of the recognized shapes relative to landmarks in the obtained ultrasound image.
