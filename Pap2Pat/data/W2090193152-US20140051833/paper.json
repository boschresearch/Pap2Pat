    "date": "2015-02-12",
    "abstract": "Bispecific antibodies enable unique therapeutic approaches but it remains a challenge to produce them at the industrial scale, and the modifications introduced to achieve bispecificity often have an impact on stability and risk of immunogenicity. Here we describe a fully human bispecific IgG devoid of any modification, which can be produced at the industrial scale, using a platform process. This format, referred to as a \u03ba\u03bb-body, is assembled by co-expressing one heavy chain and two different light chains, one \u03ba and one \u03bb. Using ten different targets, we demonstrate that light chains can play a dominant role in mediating specificity and high affinity. The \u03ba\u03bb-bodies support multiple modes of action, and their stability and pharmacokinetic properties are indistinguishable from therapeutic antibodies. Thus, the \u03ba\u03bb-body represents a unique, fully human format that exploits light-chain variable domains for antigen binding and light-chain constant domains for robust downstream processing, to realize the potential of bispecific antibodies.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "To enable the identification of mAbs binding with high specificity to two different antigens but having an identical heavy chain, we generated several human antibody variable gene repertoires combining a unique rearranged heavy chain variable gene (VH) and different repertoires of light chain variable genes (VL). We have used either generic fixed VH or the VH from an existing mAb. In the first case, the repertoire containing a generic VH can be used simultaneously for the de novo isolation of two antibodies sharing the same VH against two antigens (Fig. 1a). In the second approach, the VH of a first mAb is combined with a VL repertoire for the isolation of a second mAb with specificity for a second target (Fig. 1b). The VL sequences were either isolated from circulating B cells from healthy individuals or generated in vitro using different diversification strategies. A total of 15 scFv phage display libraries were built, containing either diversified \u03bb or \u03ba VL genes (Supplementary Table 1). In each library, the VL repertoire was combined with a unique rearranged VH based on the IGHV3-23, IGHV3-30 or IGHV3-48 germline genes17. These VH genes were chosen for their frequent occurrence in natural human antibody repertoires, intrinsic stability and suitability for in vitro display technologies1819. The total diversities of the \u03ba and \u03bb libraries were 5.6 \u00d7 1010 and 1.6 \u00d7 1010, respectively. These fixed heavy chain libraries were used separately for phage display selection and screening campaigns against several soluble and cell surface human antigens, including CD47, CD19, EpCAM, EGFR, HER2, IFN\u03b3, IL6R, MSLN, GPC3 and FOLR1. More than 680 individual sequences encoding scFvs specifically binding to one of these antigens were selected and confirmed to contain different \u03ba and \u03bb light chains. Out of the 173 unique sequences that were reformatted and expressed as hIgG1, 103 were confirmed for specific binding against their respective target antigen by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Table 1 and Fig. 2a). The binding affinities for several IgGs were determined by biolayer interferometry or surface plasmon resonance to be in the subnanomolar to the micromolar range (Supplementary Table 2). More than half of the candidates isolated directly out of the fixed VH libraries had affinities in the low nanomolar range, which is comparable to candidates isolated from standard scFv libraries bearing diversity in both heavy and light chains, thus indicating that light chains can efficiently drive high-affinity binding2021.",
                        "The interaction between CD47 and its ligand, SIRP\u03b1 (expressed on myeloid cells), conveys a negative signal that inhibits phagocytosis and plays an important role in the recognition of self by the immune system as well as other biological processes2223. We therefore evaluated whether the anti-CD47 IgGs generated by this approach could block the interaction between these two proteins in an assay monitoring the binding of SIRP\u03b1 on cells expressing CD47. Both IgGK1 and IgGK2 were able to neutralize this interaction in a dose-dependent manner. The subnanomolar IC50 observed with IgGK1 was similar to that of the neutralizing anti-hCD47 murine mAb, B6H12 (ref. 24; Fig. 2b). The interaction between MSLN and CA125/MUC16 promotes cancer cell dissemination and correlates with poor prognosis in patients25. We tested the neutralization activity of some of the anti-MSLN candidates and showed that the IgGO1 and IgGO3 could block the interaction between MSLN and CA125/MUC16 in vitro, with an IC50 similar to the therapeutic anti-MSLN mAb Amatuximab (Fig. 2d). Taken together, these results demonstrate that antibodies can be isolated directly from fixed heavy chain libraries with target\u2013ligand neutralization capacity.",
                        "Eight candidates directed against either hCD19, hCD47 or hEpCAM were selected for affinity maturation by further diversification of their VL sequences. Different randomization strategies targeting the complementary determining regions (CDR) were applied and the resulting libraries were used for selections under increasingly stringent conditions. In all cases, scFvs with a higher affinity could be isolated and confirmed in an IgG format. For instance, variants of the anti-CD47 IgGK2 with up to a >100-fold increased neutralization potential in the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 assay were generated (Fig. 2c). Another example is the low-affinity anti-CD19 IgG1B7 from which the improved variant IgGL7-1 was derived. The latter was then further optimized in a second affinity maturation round to obtain IgGL7-2, which had a 50-fold increase in affinity over the parental antibody and, subsequently, a significantly improved binding on CD19+ Raji cells (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 2). This data demonstrates that the affinity of antibodies initially isolated from fixed heavy chain libraries can be increased by optimization of the VL, while leaving the VH unmodified throughout the selection process. Taken together, the generation of a panel of over 100 human IgGs sharing a common VH and directed against 10 different antigens confirms that the light chain is sufficient to drive antibody specificity and enables the isolation of high-affinity antibodies with neutralizing activity."

                        "The V\u03ba, V\u03bb and common VH sequences of two mAbs to be combined into a \u03ba\u03bb-body were cloned into a single expression vector containing three expression cassettes, one for each of the \u03ba and \u03bb light chains (the latter containing the IGLC2\u03bb constant region) and one for the common IgG1 heavy chain. Each cassette was under the transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Overall, the method was tested with the VH and VL of 19 IgG\u03ba and 10 IgG\u03bb for the expression of 51 \u03ba\u03bb-bodies (Supplementary Table 3). Small-scale transient transfections were performed in PEAK cells, leading to the production of three species: an IgG\u03ba, an IgG\u03bb and the \u03ba\u03bb-body, with a theoretical distribution of 25%, 25% and 50%, respectively, provided the expression and assembly of the three chains is equivalent. \u03ba\u03bb-bodies were then purified from the supernatant by a three-step affinity process (Fig. 3a). First, a non-distinguishing affinity-capture chromatography step was performed using either a protein A or Capture Select CH1 resin that binds to the Fc or CH1 domain of human IgG, respectively. The common heavy chain and the two light chains differ in molecular weight and therefore could be observed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the actual distribution of three IgG forms in the supernatant was evaluated after this first purification step by separation on an isoelectric focusing gel (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The total IgG yield (8\u201352\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121) was in a range similar to those obtained for standard mAbs using this transient expression system (Supplementary Table 3), indicating that the expression of three chains in this manner did not have a negative impact on overall IgG expression. The second affinity-capture purification step, using the KappaSelect affinity resin, which binds to the human \u03ba constant region, allows for the recovery of the IgG\u03ba and the \u03ba\u03bb-body, while the IgG\u03bb is eliminated in the column flow through. Finally, the \u03ba\u03bb-body is purified to homogeneity by a third affinity-capture step, using the LambdaFabSelect affinity resin that binds selectively to human \u03bb constant region, thus eliminating the IgG\u03ba species (Fig. 3c). The purified \u03ba\u03bb-bodies were generally low in aggregate content (average of 2.8%) and in a range similar to that found for human mAbs expressed using this expression system (Supplementary Table 3). Thus, these three affinity steps enable a fast, robust and generic purification process that was successfully applied to the 51 \u03ba\u03bb-bodies characterized in this study."

                        "Inhibition of the CD47-SIPR\u03b1 interaction has been demonstrated to be an attractive strategy to increase the phagocytic activity of an anti-CD20 mAb, whereby phagocytosis was significantly increased by the co-injection of an anti-CD47 mAb, leading to complete tumour eradication24. Although appealing, targeting CD47 with a mAb is challenging due to the ubiquitous expression of this receptor. Selective inhibition of the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction on tumour cells is potentially achievable using a BiAb having one arm targeting a tumour-associated antigen and the other arm targeting CD47. The co-engagement of the two receptors should subsequently lead to increased binding on cells expressing the tumour-associated antigen via an avidity effect. We evaluated this possibility by testing the capacity of two CD47 \u00d7 CD19 \u03ba\u03bb-bodies to bind to the surface of CD19+ B cells (Raji) versus CD19\u2212 B cells (DS-1; Fig. 4a). Raji cells express similar levels of CD47 and CD19 (65,000 and 72,000, respectively) and 136,000 CD47 molecules are found at the surface of DS-1 cells, while neither Raji nor DS-1 cells express EpCAM (Supplementary Table 4). Binding of K3L7-2 to the surface of Raji cells was increased compared to DS-1 cells, indicating that CD19 and CD47 are co-engaged by K3L7-2 on Raji cells. In contrast, the CD47 \u00d7 EpCAM \u03ba\u03bb-body, K3L6-1, can only bind via the anti-CD47 K3 arm on either cell type, as neither express EpCAM. The monovalent engagement of K3L6-1 leads to weaker binding to both cells types (Fig. 4b). We then compared the potency of the anti-CD47 mAb, B6H12, with K3L7-1 and K3L7-2, as well as the K3L6-1 (that is, the monovalent control), to inhibit the binding of SIRP\u03b1 to CD47 on the surface of Raji and DS-1 cells. As expected, the IC50 observed with the anti-CD47 mAb is equivalent (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 0.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 on Raji and DS-1 cells, respectively; Fig. 4c). The potency of K3L6-1 was similar on both cell types, but lower compared with the CD47 mAb due to a loss of avidity (IC50 of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22128 and 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 on Raji and DS-1 cells, respectively). In contrast, the potency of the CD19 \u00d7 CD47 \u03ba\u03bb body K3L7-1 was more than tenfold higher on Raji cells than on DS-1 cells (IC50 of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22128, respectively). Moreover, the CD19 \u00d7 CD47 \u03ba\u03bb body K3L7-2 that incorporates the higher-affinity CD19 arm L7-2 was 300-fold more potent at inhibiting SIRP\u03b1 binding on Raji than on DS-1 cells (IC50 of 10\u221210 and 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22128, respectively; Fig. 4c). These experiments demonstrate that CD19 \u00d7 CD47 \u03ba\u03bb-bodies are able to co-engage CD47 and CD19 on the surface of Raji cells, and that the selectivity for CD19+ cells can be fine-tuned by modifying the affinity of the \u03ba\u03bb-body arms.",
                        "Tumour cell killing via retargeting of T cells with an anti-CD3 containing BiAb is an extensively studied and clinically validated mechanism of action682627. To exemplify the utility of the \u03ba\u03bb-body in additional modes of action, we generated CD3 \u00d7 EpCAM candidates. In this case, we used the sequential discovery approach (Fig. 1b) and used an existing anti-CD3 mAb as a starting point. We combined its VH (germline IGHV3-48) with repertoires of diversified light chains, to generate a library of 9.5 \u00d7 109 transformants (Library 48K, Supplementary Table I). This library was then used for phage display selections and lead to the isolation of candidates specific for EpCAM (Table I). As the resulting IgGs share the same VH as the starting anti-CD3 mAb, they could directly be used to generate CD3 \u00d7 EpCAM \u03ba\u03bb-bodies by co-expression of the two light chains and the common heavy chain as described above. Three of these \u03ba\u03bb-bodies, that is, L6-3L3-1, L6-4L3-1 and L6-5L3-1, were tested in a T-cell retargeting assay, using T cells purified from human blood and MCF-7 cells expressing EpCAM as target cells. Only the CD3 \u00d7 EpCAM \u03ba\u03bb-bodies were able to mediate MCF-7 killing in a dose-dependent manner, while the anti-CD3 and anti-EpCAM mAbs were inactive (Fig. 4d). Thus, via monovalent engagement of two different antigens either in cis at the surface of the same cell or in trans on two different cells, \u03ba\u03bb-bodies exhibit mechanisms of action that are unique to BiAbs."

To this end, we generated \u03ba\u03bb-body-expressing recombinant GS-CHO cell lines for each product using the same \u2018triple-gene\u2019 expression vectors used for the transient transfections described above. Each cassette was under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. In parallel, for \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H1-1, cell lines expressing monospecific control products (that is, transfected with \u2018double-gene\u2019 expression constructs expressing either a \u03ba light chain and an IgG1 heavy chain or a \u03bb light chain and an IgG1 heavy chain) were also generated to use as comparators.",
                        "Several cell lines for each transfection condition were initially evaluated in a non-fed overgrow fermentation to determine IgG titres. These cell lines were selected from an initial panel of ~100 cell lines screened post selection, based on their growth profiles and IgG expression levels determined during the selection process (Supplementary Table 5). No statistical differences were observed for \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H1-1, between the overall IgG productivity from the recombinant GS-CHO cell lines transfected with either the triple-gene or the control double-gene expression constructs (Supplementary Fig. 2a). These data suggest that concomitant expression of a \u03ba and \u03bb light chain along with an IgG1 heavy chain in the same cell had no detrimental effect on IgG productivity compared with the expression of either the \u03ba or \u03bb light chain and an IgG1 heavy chain. Total IgG titres from cell lines derived from the transfection with the \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H2-2, were slightly higher on average than those derived from the transfection of the \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H1-1 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). A fed-batch culture evaluation was performed using a scale-down model on five cell lines from the H2-1H1-1 transfection condition and two cell lines from the H2-1H2-2 transfection condition. At the end of the fed-batch process, titres in excess of 1\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 were obtained for all cell lines, confirming the general amenability of the \u03ba\u03bb-body bispecific format to the high productivity of a platform mammalian expression system (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Post protein A purification from the harvest culture medium, the material was analysed for the distribution of bispecific \u03ba\u03bb-body versus monospecific species. Although distribution of the monospecific species (that is, IgG1\u03ba and IgG1\u03bb) varied between candidates, the \u03ba\u03bb-body species was more consistent, ranging between 37% and 46% of the total IgG produced (Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting that \u03ba\u03bb-body expression is less sensitive to differences in \u03ba and \u03bb light chain levels than the monospecific forms.",
                        "The stability of \u03ba\u03bb-body expression was confirmed over the course of 50 generations for the recombinant GS-CHO cell lines expressing the H2-1H1-1 \u03ba\u03bb-body. For each cell line, the relative bispecific/monospecific levels were determined every ten generations, following a small-scale, non-fed overgrow fermentation culture (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The \u03ba\u03bb-body/monospecific species distribution was not found to be altered over the course of the 50 generation study for all 5 cell lines tested (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Furthermore, total IgG and \u03ba\u03bb-body titres as well as the time integral of viable cell concentration were found to be stable over time (Supplementary Fig. 3b).",
                        "Finally, the robustness of the scaled up high-titre fed-batch platform fermentation process was confirmed at two different manufacturing scales. For \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H1-1, a total IgG productivity of 1.5\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 was achieved at harvest in a 25 l wave bioreactor fermentation (Supplementary Fig. 2e) with an Ab species distribution of 41%, 12% and 47% for \u03ba\u03bb-body monospecific IgG1\u03ba and monospecific IgG1\u03bb, respectively (data not shown). For \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H2-2, in a 100 l disposable stirred bioreactor, the IgG productivity reached ~2\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 at harvest (Supplementary Fig. 2f), with an Ab species distribution of 45%, 42% and 13% for \u03ba\u03bb-body, monospecific \u03ba and monospecific \u03bb IgG1, respectively (Table 2).",
                        "The platform three-step ligand-affinity chromatography process (that is, protein A followed by KappaSelect and LambdaFabSelect; Fig. 3a) was evaluated at an industrially relevant scale using culture supernatant from the fed-batch fermentation process. Protein A chromatography conditions previously optimized for fully human recombinant IgG1\u03ba and IgG1\u03bb products expressed using the GS-CHO system were applied. However, as the KappaSelect and LambdaFabSelect chromatography conditions recommended by the supplier were developed for the purification of Fab fragments, we determined optimal capacity, flow-rate and residence time conditions for human IgG1 using an empirical approach (Supplementary Fig. 4). We selected a single set of parameters that suited both chromatography supports, to facilitate downstream processing and allowing the KappaSelect and LambdaFabSelect chromatography steps to be interchangeable. Indeed, as the culture supernatant from the \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H1-1, fermentation contained more IgG1\u03bb than IgG1\u03ba monospecific species (Supplementary Fig. 2c), we chose to place the KappaSelect chromatography step ahead of the LambdaFabSelect step, to maximize the loading capacity of the column for \u03ba\u03bb-body product. For the \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H2-2, where IgG1\u03ba was the predominant monospecific species (Supplementary Fig. 2c), we reversed the two chromatography steps. Table 2 summarizes the overall recoveries obtained for the \u03ba\u03bb-body, H2-1H2-2, produced at the 100 l scale for which 66.5\u2009g of purified \u03ba\u03bb-body were obtained after downstream processing. The ligand-affinity chromatography steps were found to be robust and selective, with the process yielding a product with the desired product quality attributes (that is, low aggregation and high purity; Fig. 5a\u2013d). Together, these data illustrate the robust platform nature of the scaled-up purification process.",
                        "Next, the stability of the \u03ba\u03bb-body format was assessed using H2-1H1-1 and H2-1H2-2 post purification. Thermal stability was investigated using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), a technique that assesses domain unfolding over a temperature range. As anticipated due to the fully human and non-engineered nature of the format, the DSF profile of the \u03ba\u03bb-body was identical to that of the \u03ba and \u03bb monospecific control Abs (Fig. 6a). Domain unfolding occurred at temperatures comparable to those reported for fully human therapeutic mAbs28. Both \u03ba\u03bb-bodies were stable, comparable to their \u03ba and \u03bb monospecific control Abs. Furthermore, using a standard formulation (that is, 10\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121 in a standard buffer), their stability was comparable to a standard mAb during storage for 6 months at either 5\u2009\u00b0C or 25\u2009\u00b0C and 3 months at 40\u2009\u00b0C (Fig. 6b\u2013e). In particular, the aggregate levels remained low for 12 weeks at either 5\u2009\u00b0C or 25\u2009\u00b0C (Fig. 6a). Finally, we assessed the stability of the \u03ba\u03bb-body format in vivo by evaluating the circulating levels of the H2-1H2-2 and K15L7-2 \u03ba\u03bb-bodies over time following a single intravenous administration in mice. Elimination kinetics for the \u03ba\u03bb-bodies were comparable to those of control human IgG1\u03ba and IgG1\u03bb (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Table 6). The calculated half lives of the four molecules were between 16 and 20 days, a range in agreement with previous reports for the half life of human IgG1 measured in mice29. The production of several candidates including K15L7-2 were scaled up, to perform a single dose, pharmacokinetic study in nonhuman primates (that is, cynomolgous monkeys). The study showed that a single intravenous administration of K15L7-2 (Fig. 6g) and three other candidates (data not shown), at doses of either 0.5 or 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, were well tolerated and the terminal plasma clearance linear."

                "In natural antibody repertoires, the VH domain is the most diversified region and, in most cases, plays a central role in antigen binding, leading to the general view that the light chain\u2019s contribution is more supplemental than a driver. Despite this observation, we have developed an antibody generation platform that delivered over 100 antibodies sharing a common heavy chain that specifically bind a panel of 10 different proteins. Our results also illustrate the suitability to depend on light-chain diversity for the generation of high-affinity binders as well as to provide potent inhibition for ligand\u2013receptor interactions. Although counterintuitive, our rationale that the light chain can drive specificity and affinity is supported by previous studies using antibody repertoires incorporating limited synthetic diversity, indicating that the CDR L3 can in some cases contribute more to antigen binding than the CDR H3 (ref. 30). Moreover, single-domain antibodies, such as VHH domains found in camelids, as well as several alternative scaffolds rely on two or three loops to establish protein\u2013protein interactions with the target313233. Finally, bovine antibodies often solely rely on their extended CDR H3 for interaction with the antigen, further indicating specificity does not necessarily require multiple interacting loops34.",

Furthermore, we were able to use either a predefined, fixed VH for a parallel discovery approach (Fig. 1a) or commence by employing the VH of an existing mAb (Fig. 1b). This second scenario can be quite attractive, as it enables the combination of a well-characterized mAb, with potentially suitable properties, into a \u03ba\u03bb-body. These two options for VH usage illustrate the flexibility of the technology. In this study, we have successfully used three germlines of the VH3 family. Additional studies using different VH germlines will indicate whether some frameworks are better suited than others for creating \u03ba\u03bb-bodies. It is possible that fixing the heavy chain in the libraries could lead to some constraints that might limit the targeting of certain epitopes. Identifying such potential constraints is difficult, as in fact, we generated candidates against ten different targets demonstrating that no major limitation existed at least for this set of antigens. Interestingly, we observed that when the fixed VH used during the selection of the VL was changed for another VH in the IgG, the binding capacity was lost, although the IgG could still be assembled (data not shown), indicating that the heavy chain either directly contributed to the interaction with the antigen or in an indirect manner by interacting with light-chain CDRs. Future structural studies will help to clarify the relative roles of the two chains in fixed heavy-chain antibodies directed against different epitopes.",
                "Most approaches to generate a BiAb aim at forcing the secretion of a unique species of bispecific molecule by the production cell line or rely on the assembly of half antibodies that are secreted independently1135. In many formats, the CH3\u2013CH3 interface is modified to favour formation of heavy-chain heterodimers, and swapping of CH1 and CL constant domains or remodelling of the CH1\u2013CL and VH\u2013VL interfaces has been used to promote correct heavy- and light-chain pairing91215. Despite numerous elegant molecular designs, unwanted product-related contaminants, mainly in the form of homodimers, multimers or molecules containing mispaired domains are also produced, and their elimination during downstream processing can be challenging. However, several BiAbs are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, demonstrating that these development hurdles can be overcome3637. Here we have taken a different approach by allowing three unmodified immunoglobulin chains to assemble naturally, and using a robust and scalable purification process to retrieve the bispecific \u03ba\u03bb-body. The benefit of our strategy is that the \u03ba\u03bb-body contains no mutations or nonhuman sequences (except for diversification of the light-chain CDRs that confer target specificity) and is therefore indistinguishable from a human IgG. In line with this, the stability of our \u03ba\u03bb-bodies during processing and storage, as well as their pharmacokinetic profiles in mice and non-human primates were comparable to those of a human IgG. Given the limited number of BiAbs having entered clinical trials, the potential impact on immunogenicity of linkers or mutations introduced at the interface between constant domains that are present in different BiAb formats is currently difficult to evaluate. It is however an important point of consideration that will become better understood, as more BiAbs, using different architectures, will enter clinical development for acute and, in particular, chronic indications38. It can be anticipated from the observations made during the last decades with therapeutic mAbs, that \u2018foreignness\u2019 of sequence, level of aggregates and purity from contaminants for provocation of anti-drug antibodies will also apply to BiAbs394041. The stability and the human nature of \u03ba\u03bb-bodies should therefore minimize the risk of immunogenicity. The \u2018two-in-one antibody\u2019 is another approach that generates unmodified human IgG capable of binding two different antigens42. In this format, the antibody combining site is engineered so that it can bind two targets independently but not simultaneously. This elegant format also benefits from unmodified IgG properties, but because the nature of the antigen bound by each combining site cannot be controlled, this format is not suitable for applications such as T-cell retargeting, where the bridging between two targets is required.",
                "Another important similarity between \u03ba\u03bb-bodies and therapeutic mAbs is that the purification process is platform, that is, can be applied to any \u03ba\u03bb-body, thus facilitating parallel development of multiple candidates. By establishing stable cell lines using a recombinant CHO system and scaling up the bioprocess to 100\u2009l, we demonstrated compatibility with industrial scale manufacturing. Notably, the \u03ba\u03bb-bodies are also able to perform BiAb mechanisms by, for example, mediating co-engagement of two antigens in cis at surface of the same cell or in trans, for example, bridging two cells.",
                "In summary, the \u03ba\u03bb-body represents a unique human BiAb format that exploits the antibody light chain for antigen-binding specificity and robust downstream processing. The stability and fully human nature of the \u03ba\u03bb-body should be particularly well suited for therapeutic intervention, especially in chronic settings."

For small-scale (50\u2009ml Erlenmeyer flask) non-batch fermentations, cells were inoculated at 2 \u00d7 105 cells per ml in CD CHO medium (Invitrogen) and harvested following 10 days of culture. For small-scale (50\u2013100\u2009ml Erlenmeyer flask), 25 l WAVE Bioreactor (GE Healthcare) and 100\u2009l STR 200 fed-batch fermentations, the Lonza Biologics media and feed version 7.0 platform process was followed. Cultures were harvested at day 15 post-inoculum or within 24\u2009h of the viability dropping below 70%, whichever came first.",
                        "Culture supernatant at harvest was clarified by depth filtration using a D0HC/B1HC/filtration train (Millipore) followed by a 0.22-\u03bcm filtration into a flexboy (Sartorius) and subjected to three-step ligand affinity chromatography comprising the MabSelectSure, KappaSelect and LambdaFabSelect affinity resins (GE Healthcare). Running conditions are as described in figure legends. KappaSelect and LambdaFabSelect affinity resins were loaded at pH 7.0. To remove unbound proteins, all resins were washed sequentially with 50\u2009mM sodium phosphate, 250\u2009mM NaCl, pH 7.0, and 50\u2009mM sodium phosphate, 1\u2009M NaCl, pH 7.0. Bound proteins were eluted with 50\u2009mM glycine/HCl, pH 3.5. Following purification, the \u03ba\u03bb-body product was formulated into 25\u2009mM histidine, 125\u2009mM NaCl, pH 6.0, for subsequent analyses. For the assessment of stability during storage, \u03ba\u03bb-body was aliquoted into type I glass vials sealed with flurotec-coated rubber stoppers (West Pharmaceutical)."

The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used with the Protein 80 kit as described by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies). Four microlitres of purified samples were mixed with sample buffer supplemented with dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were heated at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and then loaded onto the chip.",
                        "BiAb distribution (in a mix with monospecific species) and integrity was assessed by isoelectric focusing (Cambrex pH 3\u201310 IsoGel agarose plates) and SDS\u2013PAGE analysis (Novex NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis Tris gels). Distribution and purity was quantified by HIC-HPLC with a ProPac HIC-10 column (Dionex) using 10\u2009mM sodium phosphate, 1.0\u2009M ammonium sulfate, pH 3.5, mobile phase and a 10\u2009mM sodium phosphate, 10 % acetonitrile, pH 3.5, buffer for gradient elution. The limit of detection of this HIC-HPLC method is 1%. Aggregate and fragment levels were determined by SEC-HPLC with a Biosep-SEC-s3000 column (Phenomenex) for H2-1H1-1 or a TSKgel G3000SWXL column (Tosoh) for H2-1H2-2. Both columns were run using a 200-mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, mobile phase. DSF was performed with the SYPRO Orange fluorescent probe (Invitrogen) using a Rotor-Gene Q 2plex HRM platform (Qiagen). Five micrograms of antibodies formulated in PBS were mixed with SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) diluted from a 20 \u00d7 concentrate in a total volume of 20\u2009\u03bcl. Samples in 0.2-ml PCR tubes (Qiagen) were loaded onto 72-well rotor disc, which was mounted on a Rotor-Gene Q 2 plex HRM cycler (Qiagen). Fluorescence was then measured with the HRM channel and plotted against temperature using the following parameters: temperature ramp from 35 to 95\u2009\u00b0C, 1\u2009\u00b0C rise of temperature at each step, 5\u2009s between each step.",
                        "The melting temperature was determined with the Rotor-Gene Q software (Qiagen, version 2.1.0) and defined as the turning point of the sigmoidal-like curve of fluorescence plotted against temperature. The melting temperature was calculated by assigning the minimum of the corresponding inverted second derivative curve. All samples were tested for endotoxin contamination according to the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test (Charles River Laboratories)."

The single dose pharmacokinetic profile of the BiAb in mice was determined by injecting 5\u2009mg per kg in the tail vein of 8-week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Serum human IgG concentrations were determined using the FastELYSA system (RD-Biotech). Serum from three animals was tested for each time point. BiAb concentrations was also measured using a sandwich ELISA format comprising a biotin-coupled anti-\u03bb domain capture reagent and an horeseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-\u03ba mAb detection reagent (Jackson ImmunoResearch), to confirm the integrity of the \u03ba\u03bb-body. An in-vivo study was performed in non-human primates, to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the \u03ba\u03bb-body K15L7-2. Female cynomolgus monkeys (three per group) of 2.5\u20133.7\u2009kg and in the age range of 2\u20133 years were dosed once by intravenous administration of K15L7-2 at 0.5 or 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121. The animals were inspected twice daily and any clinical observations were recorded. Blood samples were collected at various time points for 8 weeks. The serum concentrations of K15L7-2 were determined by ELISA, using a generic human IgG detection immunoassay. This study was performed at Covance Laboratories GmbH test facility in Munster. All procedures in the study were in compliance with the German Animal Welfare Act and were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee."
