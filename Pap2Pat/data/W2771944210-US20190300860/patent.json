As such, intestinal neuromodulation impacts many aspects of human health and an improved understanding of such a system would have major implications improving the health of patients worldwide. The enteric nervous system (ENS) has been termed the \u2018second brain\u2019 due to its central role in autonomy, functional control and impact in the human body. Current options to assess intestine neuromodulatory functions are primarily limited to animal studies, cell culture studies, organoids and related systems, all of which have inherent limitations."

                        "Intestinal Tissue",
                        "The human small intestine is a highly complex hollow organ located at the upper part of the intestinal tract. It is comprised of an intestinal epithelium, lamina propria, submucosa, muscularis mucosa, and serosa. The small intestinal epithelium is the innermost layer featuring two topographic structures, the villi (luminal protrusions) and crypts (luminal invaginations), on the top of which trillions of commensal microbes reside. The epithelium covering the villi encompasses at least four major cell populations: absorptive enterocyte cells, mucus-producing Goblet cells, hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells (EECs), and antimicrobial peptide secreting Paneth cells in the crypt. All intestinal epithelial cell types are derived from proliferative crypt regions containing undifferentiated intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that self-renew to maintain stem cell populations which are identified by the specific expression of leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 gene (Lgr5). These differentiated epithelial cells enable the small intestine to perform two major physiological functions: efficient absorbance of nutrients and water from ingested food and establishment of a dynamic physical and biochemical barrier against external toxins and invading enteric pathogens. Loss of either of these functions is associated with the initiation and propagation of several intestine diseases, such as bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, and inflammatory bowel diseases, which affect millions of people worldwide. To develop effective solutions to this worldwide problem, animal models are utilized for studies related to its causes and treatments, however, costly facilities and lack of correlations to human physiological responses limit the relevance of these animal models. This disconnect has limited the development of effective treatments to combat many of these infectious diseases, leaving large populations around the world susceptible. Tissue engineering approaches offer an alternative strategy to recapitulate human intestinal structure and function in vitro, which circumvent the limitations of animal models and provide new experimental systems with which detailed study of disease and interventions can be pursued in a more effective manner.",
                        "In the past decade, there have been many attempts to recreate in vitro bioengineered intestine-like tissue models for the study of intestinal diseases and for the development of new therapies. However, previously existing in vitro models of the human intestine rely on cultures of intestinal epithelial cell monolayers on cell culture platforms to mimic the human small intestine microenvironment. These culture platforms may be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) and typically include flattened or ridged 2D substrates, microfabricated substrates, microfluidic chips, hollow fiber bioreactors, or biomaterial scaffolds. The major pitfall of the abovementioned intestine models is the use of heterogeneous human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines, such as Caco-2 and HT-29. Cell lines are not representative of native intestinal tissue in many ways. For instance, each cell line only comprises one single cell population and fails to recapitulate the cell diversity in normal intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, the genotype of the subclones of these cell lines, especially Caco-2 cells, tends to change with increasing passage numbers or with differing culture conditions, yielding at best, inconsistent drug screening and host-pathogen interaction data. A s a result, the pharmaceutical industry, which uses cell line-derived intestinal systems for drug testing purposes, suffers high attrition rates, with less than 10% of clinical drug candidates making it to phase I testing and entering the market. In an attempt to overcome the limitations of cell lines, tissue engineers have adopted primary human small intestinal epithelial cells (hInEpiCs) which are isolated directly from native intestinal tissues for the in vitro establishment of a more physiologically relevant human small intestinal epithelium. However, hInEpiCs are difficult to isolate, remain viable for only several days and readily lose their phenotype in culture, hampering their widespread application in tissue engineering. Therefore, an alternative non-transformed epithelial cell source is needed to model a physiological 3D human intestine, and is provided in the present invention.",
                        "In some embodiments, provided compositions comprise or are created at least in part through the use of human small intestinal enteroids (HIEs). HIEs are LGR5-positive intestinal stem cells generated ex vivo from small intestinal crypt samples (endoscopic biopsies or surgical tissues) of individuals consenting to tissue donation for research. Compared to cancer cell lines and hInEpiCs, HIEs have at least two major advantages. First, HIEs, when cultured under the correct conditions, can self-renew, expand indefinitely and differentiate into all cell types of the intestinal epithelium. Secondly, HIEs are patient-specific, which may allow investigation of personalized therapeutics. Each enteorid has a micro-scaled enclosed lumen with apical cell surfaces facing the lumen and basal surfaces exposed to the Matrigel. For a long time, accessing the lumen of enteroids and inducing appropriate luminal stimulations or bacterial infections has been difficult, limiting their use in intestinal tissue modeling and disease studies.",
                        "Tight Junction Formation",
                        "In some embodiments, provided compositions include the formation of one or more tight junctions. Tight junctions, as used herein, refers to the formation of closely associated areas between two or more cells wherein the membranes of those cells form an impermeable or semi-permeable barrier to one or more substances (e.g., to microbial pathogens, toxic substances, ions, allergens, etc). In some embodiments, a tight junction will prevent or substantially prevent the passage of a fluid, ions and molecules. Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) maintain the intestinal barrier while regulating permeability of ions, nutrients, and water. The epithelial pemeability can be measured in terms of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value. TEER values of a fully differentiated intestinal epithelial monolayer range between 200-1500 \u03a9\u00b7cm2. The permeability can also be assessed by using permeability markers, including FITC-dextran, ovalbumin, polyethylene glycol and lactulose/mannitol. Tight junctions, as used herein, refers to the formation of closely associated areas between two or more cells wherein the membranes of those cells form an impermeable or semi-permeable barrier to one or more substances (e.g., to microbial pathogens, toxic substances, ions, allergens, etc).

Microvilli greatly increase the intestinal surface area, and are known to be important for nutrient absorption, mucus secretion, digestive enzyme secretion, and cellular adhesion. In vivo, microvilli also typically include a glycocalyx coating which itself comprises glycoproteins.",

In some embodiments, one or more digestive enzymes are secreted by enteroendocrine cells, as further described below.",
                        "Low Oxygen Tension",
                        "Low oxygen tension is critical for intestinal tissue function, as it is required for maintenance of a healthy gut microbial community. Prior to the present invention, in vitro generation and dynamic control of oxygen gradients mimicking in vivo intestinal tissue, which vary from the anaerobic lumen across the epithelium into the highly vascularized sub-epithelium, has been a challenge for bioengineering and tissue regeneration. Accordingly, one of the advantages of various embodiments is that some provided compositions are able to exhibit a low oxygen tension.",
                        "In some embodiments, provided compositions may exist in or include portions that exhibit a state low oxygen tension. In some embodiments, the low oxygen tension means less than 5% pO2. In some embodiments, the low oxygen tension means less than 2% pO2. In some embodiments, provided compositions which comprise a lumen exhibit a depth-graded oxygen profile, for example, in a luminal direction. By way of specific example, for non-patterned scaffold lumens, in some embodiments wherein a silk fibroin scaffold includes a hollow channel and thus a lumen, when such provided compositions are oriented vertically, in the scaffold lumen, a region of microaerobic conditions (pO2 between 5% and 1%) may be detected at depths ranging from 2 to 5 mm into the scaffold lumen; and a nanaerobic region (pO2 \u02dc1%) may be detected at the depth of 5 to 6 mm. By way of additional specific example, for pattened-lumens, a highly oxygen-deficient, anaerobic condition (pO2<0.1%) was found at a depth of 2 to 6 mm in the lumens.",

                        "Enterocytes are absorptive intestinal cells found in the small intestine. Typically, enterocytes include a surface coating (called a glycocalyx) which includes, inter alia, digestive enzymes. Enterocytes are known to have a variety of functions including, but not limited to uptake of a variety of materials including ions, water, sugars, lipids, protein and other amino acids, and vitamins; resorption of unconjugated bile salts; and secretion of immunoglobulins.",

                        "Fibroblasts are cells are a stromal cell that is known to synthesize collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix including glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans. In vivo, intestinal myofibroblasts are fibroblasts that reside in proximity to epithelial cells and provide nutrition and support. It is also known the fibroblasts play a role in supporting the growth and differentiation of intestinal epithelium. Further, intestinal myofibroblasts are known to be important in initiating certain antimicrobial reactions in the body (e.g., inflammation).",
                        "Goblet Cells",
                        "Goblet cells are epithelial cells whose primary functions is to secrete mucus. Goblet cells in general are highly polarized with the nucleus at one end and a large number of secretory granules at the other. The presence of the mucus containing granules are responsible for the shape form which these cells derive their name. Goblet cells may be found throughout the intestinal epithelia and in both the large and small intestines. Goblet cell function is important to intestinal health at least because mucus is critical in lubricating the surface of the intestine and protecting the tissue form insult. In vivo, the intestinal mucus layer in humans is known to be approximately 200 \u03bcm thick, though the thickness can vary somewhat in humans and may be less in other species.",

The microenvironment, has been shown to provide geometric tunability for cellular cultures, mimicking physiorelevant conditions. Tissue engineered systems offer the potential for a technology that encompasses the properties of the endogenous human system in a modular, tunable in vitro model. Therefore, we disclose the development of an in vitro human innervated intestinal tissue model that encompasses both human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) that may be differentiated into pertinent enteric nervous system neural cell types, as well as enterocyte and goblet cells that create the intestinal epithelial layer.

Past work indicates that a neural driven cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway directly modulates the systemic response to pathogen invasion. In the GI tract the net response of nerve activation upregulates the mucosal defense, demonstrating its importance in pathogenesis prevention.

Currently, the mechanisms by which the ENS affects intestinal inflammation are being explored through the intestinal barrier functions, innate immunity, and immunoregulation. Additionally, alterations in the level of mucosal enterochromaffin cell-derived serotonin (5-HT) levels oppose symptoms of intestinal inflammation, which is promoted in the presence of 5-HT. By emulating the conditions found within mouse models in the in vitro tissue model, we can compare the mechanisms present in human cells to the in vivo models."

                                "In some embodiments, one or more silk scaffolds (and/or silk solutions from which a scaffold is made) may comprise, for example, low molecular weight silk fibroin fragments (e.g., fragments of silk fibroin between 3 kDa and 200 kDa), though any molecular weight silk may be used in accordance with various embodiments. In any of the embodiments described herein, silk fibroin fragments can include one or more mutations and/or modifications, relative to a naturally occurring (e.g., wild type) sequence of silk fibroin. Such mutation and/or modification in the silk fibroin fragment can be spontaneously occurring or introduced by design. For example, in some embodiments, such mutation and/or modification in the silk fibroin fragment can be introduced using recombinant techniques, chemical modifications, etc.",

                                "In some embodiments, a conformational change can be induced in the silk fibroin to control the solubility of the silk fibroin composition. In some embodiments, the conformational change can induce the silk fibroin to become at least partially insoluble. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, an induced conformational change may alter the crystallinity of the silk fibroin, e.g., Silk II beta-sheet crystallinity. In accordance with various embodiments, the conformational change can be induced by any methods known in the art, including, but not limited to, alcohol immersion (e.g., ethanol, methanol), water annealing, shear stress, ultrasound (e.g., by sonication), pH reduction (e.g., pH titration and/or exposure to an electric field) and any combinations thereof. For example, the conformational change can be induced by one or more methods, including but not limited to, controlled slow drying (Lu et al., Biomacromolecules 2009, 10, 1032); water annealing (Jin et al., 15 Adv. Funct. Mats. 2005, 15, 1241; Hu et al; Biomacromolecules 2011, 12, 1686); stretching (Demura & Asakura, Biotech & Bioengin. 1989, 33, 598); compressing; solvent immersion, including methanol (Hofmann et al., J Control Release. 2006, 111, 219), ethanol (Miyairi et al., J.

                                "In some embodiments, the conformation of the silk fibroin can be altered by water annealing. Without wishing to be bound by a theory, it is believed that physical temperature-controlled water vapor annealing (TCWVA) provides a simple and effective method to obtain refined control of the molecular structure of silk biomaterials. The silk materials can be prepared with control of crystallinity, from a low beta-sheet content using conditions at 4\u00b0 C. (a helix dominated silk I structure), to higher beta-sheet content of \u02dc60% crystallinity at 100\u00b0 C. (\u03b2-sheet dominated silk II structure). This physical approach covers the range of structures previously reported to govern crystallization during the fabrication of silk materials, yet offers a simpler, green chemistry, approach with tight control of reproducibility. Water or water vapor annealing is described, for example, in PCT application no. PCT/US2004/011199, filed Apr. 12, 2004 and no. PCT/US2005/020844, filed Jun. 13, 2005; and Jin et al., Adv. Funct.

Specifically, in this Example, Teflon made rods and tubes were used to construct a mold first. The basement layer was prepared by casting PDMS prepolymer (10:1 w/w ratio of PDMS to curing agent) in the mold and the inner layer walls were prepared by casting ECOFLEX\u00ae 00-30 silicone rubber (1:1 w/w ratio of part 1A and part 1B). The ECOFLEX\u00ae was highly stretchable rubber and PDMS was less deformable. After the inner layer wall formed, PDMS was used again to form the outside layer of the bioreactor. An airtight chamber was created between the inner layer wall and outside layer wall. A barbed socket was mounted to the outside layer. In the center of the basement, an adaptor was mounted on the bottom layer of the scaffold. The upper end of this adaptor inside the inner layer was used to fit into the lumen of the tissue scaffold; the lower end of this adaptor was used to connect the tube which reserve the waste medium. A lid was used to cover the bioreactor. In the center of the lid, another adaptor was mounted in the center of the lid. The lower end of this adaptor inside the bioreactor was used to fit the lumen of the scaffold, and the other end of this adaptor was used to connect the tube to transport the medium. Before close of the lid, the lumen of the intestinal tissue was set into the upper end of the adapter in the basement of the bioreactor and nutrient medium was filled in the rest space. When the lid in the bioreactor was closed, the lower end of the adaptor in the lid would also fit into the lumen of the scaffold (see FIG. 1).",

                                "Among the advantages provided by some embodiments of the present invention, the bioreactor exemplified in this Example highlights at least two new and powerful physiologically relevant features, a perfusion system and peristaltic motion system. For the exemplary perfusion system described in this Example, the intestinal tissue was fit between two adaptors. The epithelium culture medium was circulated at a constant flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/h, which corresponds to a shear stress of 0.02 dyne/cm2, was perfused through the lumen of the scaffold. This flow was sufficient to provide nutrient support to the epithelial layer of the tissue. The rest space in the bioreactor was filled with nutrient medium to support the myofibroblast in the sponge of the tissue. After the first two weeks, until the epithelium was well formed, the perfusion medium was changed to simulated intestinal fluid, which better mimics the physiology of the systems. For the exemplary peristaltic motion system described in this Example, a tube was used to connect the socket and the syringe pump which pump and plug air into the chamber to create a different air pressure inside the chamber and outside environment. Therefore, the highly stretchable ECOFLEX\u00ae could provide mechanical stimulation to the tissue inside the inner wall. The frequency of the deformation was set to 2 cycle/min, 5 cycle/min and 10 cycle/min separately (see FIG. 2).",

                                "In the oxygen control system described in this Example, a media container, serving as a perfusion liquid reservoir, was sealed and purged with a gas mixture with the desired oxygen level for 24 hours prior to perfusion. To create a microaerophilic lumen environment, a gas mixture of 5% CO2, <5% O2, >90% N2 was used to pre-equilibrate the luminal media. To create an anaerobic lumen environment, the luminal perfusion medium was equilibrated with <1% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2 gas. To create a fully anaerobic environment in the lumen (<0.1%), the oxygen was reduced to the lowest level we could attain by perfusion. The luminal perfusion medium was equilibrated with 4% H2, 5% CO2, 91% N2 gas. The oxygen levels in each perfusion medium were monitored with a Microx TX3 oximeter (PreSens, Regensburg, Germany). The purge gas compositions may be tailored to meet specific needs in engineering of a particular desired luminal-epithelial oxygenation profile. The pHs of the perfusion media were checked using a SevenMulti benchtop pH meter (Mettler-Toledo; Columbus, Ohio, USA) immediately before and after purging. Medium was collected in waste bottles after perfusion for further analysis (FIG. 3).",

Briefly, the hollow channel of the 3D scaffolds was used to accommodate human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells (3:1)), while the porous bulk space was used, inter alia, to house primary human intestinal myofibroblasts (H-InMyoFibs). After implanting the cells in the scaffold, the tissues were housed in the well plate with a nutrient medium (DMEM: SMGM (1:1)) for 24 hours. Subsequently, the tissue was set into the bioreactor. For the short term study (2 weeks), the epithelium culture medium was perfused at a constant flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/h through the lumen of the scaffold. The frequency of air pumping was set to either 2 cycle/min, 5 cycle/min or 10 cycle/min separately. For the long term study, the epithelium culture medium was perfused at a constant flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/h through the lumen of the scaffold in the first 2 weeks. After that, the perfused medium was changed to simulated intestinal fluid with the same perfusion speed. The frequency of the air pumping was set to 2 cycle/min to compare control sample (static, perfuse only, without peristaltic associated movement).",

                                "3D silk scaffolds were prepared as described previously. Briefly, silk fibroin was extracted from Bombyx mori silkworm cocoons. To prepare silk scaffolds with hollow channels, special cylindrical molds were cast from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Down Corning). PDMS was prepared by mixing the base reagent with the curing reagent in a mass ratio of 10:1. The cylindrical PDMS molds consisted of a Teflon-coated stainless steel wire (diameter, 2 mm; McMaster-Carr) inserted through the cross section of the cylinder to develop a hollow channel in the silk scaffold. Finally, a 4 to 5% (wt/vol) viscous silk solution was poured into the PDMS molds. The molds were frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. overnight and then transferred to a lyophilizer for drying. The dried silk scaffolds were then autoclaved to induce the \u03b2-sheet conformations (insolubility in water), soaked in distilled water overnight, and trimmed along the axis of the hollow channel into a cuboid 5 by 5 by 8 mm. The fabrication method resulted in a scaffold consisting of a hollow channel space (diameter, 2 mm) and a bulk space around the channel that contained interconnected pores (FIG. 9d).",

The cell seeding strategy for HIE-derived constructs is summarized in FIG. 9. For each HIE-derived scaffold, before being seeded on the scaffolds, 4 wells of HIEs were collected by washing with 500 uL/well of 0.5 mM EDTA (0.5M EDTA diluted 1:1000 in PBS), spun at 1200 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. for 5 mins. HIEs were then digested with 0.25% Trypsin for 4 mins at 37\u00b0 C. to obtain pellets containing singlets and doublets for luminal cell seeding. Pellets were resuspended in 354, enteroid growth medium containing 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich), and then seeded onto each side of the scaffold lumen. Collagen gels containing 2\u00d7105 H-InMyoFibs per ml were then delivered into the spongy silk scaffold bulks. HIE-derived scaffolds were first cultured in enteroid growth medium containing 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 over night, and then switched to differentiation medium (growth medium without the addition of Wnt 3a, Nicotinamide and SB202190, and with 50% reductions in the concentrations of R-Spondin and Noggin conditioned medium). HIE-derived tissues were cultured in differentiation medium up to 14 days.

Each of the 3D intestinal tissue scaffolds was then placed in an Eppendorf tube with its luminal direction oriented perpendicularly, and allowed to stabilize for 1 to 2 hours before taking measurements. In each step of probe advancement (0.05 inch/step), the oxygen tension reading was allowed to equilibrate for at least 5 minutes followed by data recording. At the end of each depth-profile measurement, the probe was retracted and the process was repeated 3 times for each sample. Five oxygen readings (30 sec/reading) were collected at each measurement position, subsequently averaged and plotted (FIG. 10).

We bioengineered the primary intestine model by cultivating HIE-derived primary epithelial cells on the luminal surface of silk scaffolds and primary human intestinal myofibroblasts (H-InMyoFibs) within the scaffold bulk space as feeder cells (FIG. 9a-d). After cell seeding, the HIE-derived scaffolds were maintained in growth medium overnight and then differentiation medium for up to 14 days. Three days after tissue differentiation, the primary small intestinal epithelial cells derived from HIEs formed confluent monolayers on the luminal surface of 3D silk scaffolds. The process of differentiation led to the formation of brush border with well-developed microvilli (FIG. 9e and FIG. 11), the presentence of apical ZO-1 tight junctions (FIG. 9f), and a polarized distribution of membrane components, such as digestive enzymes, ALP (FIG. 9g).",

Thus, we next aimed to identify the four cell populations from HIE-derived epithelium under differentiation on 3D silk scaffolds. Two other major cell sources for in vitro intestine engineering, Caco-2/HT29-MTX and hInEpiCs, seeded in the same scaffolds were used for the comparison (FIG. 12a, b). Antibodies for each cell population were used for immunostaining. Using confocal microscopy, in HIE-derived epithelium, enterocytes were identified by Sucrase-isomaltase (SI) (FIG. 12c), an enterocyte-specific, brush-border enzyme; Goblet cells by Mucin 2 (Muc2) (FIG. 12d), a mucin exclusively and abundantly expressed by goblet cells; Paneth cells by Lysozyme (FIG. 12e), specific marker for mature Paneth cells; and EECs by Chromogranin A (ChgA) (FIG. 120, a general cell surface markers for the enteroendocrine cells. Four markers were also observed in hInEpiC-derived epithelium (day 5 post cell seeding); however, the intensity of staining was relatively weaker. In cell line-derived epithelium (day 21 post cell seeding), the staining of Lysozyme and ChgA was not detectable, which means no Paneth cells and EECs present in the system. In addition to locating the protein expression of these markers by imaging, their gene expression in the epithelium grown in 3D constructs were also assessed by quantitative PCR. We found that mature HIE-derived epithelium (day 3) had the overall highest expression of these four marker transcripts than hInEpiC-derived (day 5) and cell line-derived epithelia (day 21) (FIG. 12o).",

                                "Typically, the maturity of the differentiated cells is evaluated by transcript levels of representative characteristic markers. To further characterize HIE-derived epithelial cell genotypes within the 3D scaffold culture, we performed mRNA expression analysis to directly quantify the gene expression levels of an extensive panel of known intestinal differentiation markers over time (FIG. 10). The markers included the four abovementioned epithelial cell markers (SI, Muc2, Lysozyme and ChgA), mature epithelium markers (ZO-1, Villi and ALP), and an intestinal stem cell marker, Lgr5. HIE-derived epithelium showed a significant upregulation (\u02dc6-26 fold) of all marker genes after 3 days of cultivation in differentiation medium, with stable expression levels until around day 9 (FIG. 10). In contrast, hInEpiC-derived constructs only showed upregulated mRNA expression levels of SI, CghA, ZO-1, Villin, and ALP at day 5. The mRNA expression levels of the genes began to go down after day 7 (FIG. 10a, d, e, f, g). Cell line-derived constructs achieved stable expression of marker genes between days 14-21. Although the enterocyte marker (SI) and Goblet cell marker (Muc-2) were highly expressed in cell line-derived epithelium on 3D scaffolds (FIG. 10a, b), the Paneth cell marker (Lysozyme) and EEC marker (ChgA) were almost undetectable (FIG. 10c, d). Generally, HIE-derived and hInEpiC-derived epithelia survived for shorter terms in culture (\u02dc9-12 days) than cell line-derived epithelium (\u02dc8 weeks); however, differentiated HIE-derived epithelium on 3D scaffolds reached maturity earlier (\u02dc3 days) than the hInEpiC-derived (\u02dc5-7 days) and the cell line-derived (\u02dc15-21) epithelia. Moreover, the overall expression levels of all markers from HIE-derived epithelium on 3D scaffolds were significantly higher than cell line-derived and hInEpiC-derived epithelia across all time points. The expression of Lgr5 transcript was only detectable in HIE-derived scaffolds and declined after differentiation (FIG. 10h).",

This hollow structure enables decreased oxygen levels which mimic in vivo conditions through oxygen consumption kinetics and metabolic activities of the cells in the lumen. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether HIE-derived cells grown in the lumen of the 3D scaffolds would also experience low oxygen tension. Similar to cell line-derived scaffolds (FIG. 13c), HIE-derived scaffolds also exhibited depth-graded oxygen profiles in the luminal direction (FIG. 13a). In the HIE-derived scaffolds, a region of microaerobic conditions (pO2 between 5% and 1%) was detected at depths ranging from 2 to 5 mm into the scaffold lumen; a nanaerobic region (pO2 \u02dc1%) was detected at the depth of 5 to 6 mm. However, in hInEpiC-derived scaffolds, the lowest pO2 measured in the lumen was \u02dc6% (FIG. 13b).",

Differentiated HIE-derived epithelium (3 days post differentiation), hInEpiC-derived epithelium (5 days in culture) and cell line-derived epithelium (15 days in culture) were separately incubated with a non-invasive strain of E. coli (BL23(DE3)). Gene expression profiles of epithelial cells from the three epithelial models were determined by the PCR array at 4 hours post inoculation, and compared with controls of each cell source without E. coli co-culture. The gene expression ratios between infected HIE-derived epithelium, infected hInEpiC-derived epithelium or infected cell line-derived epithelium and their corresponding uninfected control samples for all 84 genes were clustered and displayed in heat maps where individual elements of the plot are colored according to their standardized expression values (FIG. 14a-c; red squares: upregulated genes; green squares: downregulated genes). Compared to hInEpiC-derived and cell line-derived epithelia, HIE-derived epithelium displayed more upregulation after exposure to E. coli (more red squares). To more directly illustrate how these various source-derived epithelia on 3D scaffolds responded to the E. coli infection, the standardized expression values of all upregulated genes in FIG. 14a-c are displayed as a heat-map detailed in FIG. 14g for the cell line derived, hInEpiC-derived and HIE-derived epithelium samples, respectively (FIG. 14g; red squares: high expression; green squares: low expression). The dominant bright red color in HIE-derive epithelium indicated the enhanced antibacterial response of HIE-derived epithelium compared to hInEpiC-derived and cell line-derived epithelia. Based on gene selection criteria (P<0.05 and fold change \u22654), we identified 34 upregulated genes for HIE-derived epithelium, 16 upregulated genes for hInEpiC-derived epithelium, and 21 upregulated genes for cell line-derived epithelium (FIG. 14d-f).

                                "As described herein, the combination of stem cells and 3D biomaterial scaffolds has emerged as a promising strategy for tissue engineering. Stem cell-derived enteroids from human patients have become a valuable ex vivo model of normal human intestinal epithelia, allowing the indefinite establishment and propagation from normal nontumorigenic human specimens. In this Example, stem cell-derived spherical HIEs from the intestinal crypt were used to investigate the possibility of growing the HIE-derived primary epithelial cells in the 3D tubular silk scaffold system in vitro with H-InMyoFibs embedded in the system bulk for the tissue engineering of a 3D primary human intestinal epithelium. The results suggest that the 3D silk scaffold system supports a primary functional intestinal epithelium derived from HIEs. The resulting epithelial tissues formed in the 3D scaffolds consisted of multiple differentiated and undifferentiated stem cells found in human native intestine, expressed elevated levels of transcripts of intestinal markers, generated low oxygen tension in the lumen, and demonstrated a significant anti-bacterial response to bacterial infections.",
                                "In this Example, we adapted a previously published protocol for the isolation and differentiation of single stem cells from patient-derived enteroids. As shown, the single cells formed a confluent monolayer on the luminal surface of the 3D scaffolds. After culture in differentiation medium, four major native human intestinal epithelial cells were identified in the mature HIE-derived epithelium on 3D scaffolds by immunofluorescence analysis for protein expression (FIG. 12c-f) and qRT-PCR for expression of cell population-specific transcripts (FIG. 10o). The cells included the absorptive enterocyte cells, the mucus-producing Goblet cells, the hormone-secreting EECs, and the antimicrobial peptide secreting Paneth cells. The epithelium also developed mature epithelial markers, including ZO-1 tight junctions, dense microvilli with brush border, and ALP production (FIG. 9e-g). Additionally, the gene expression of crypt stem cell marker Lgr5 was also detected in the tissue, indicating the existence of intestinal stem cells in culture (FIG. 10h). These findings suggested that the 3D silk scaffold system provides an appropriate epithelial niche for the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells. Silk protein as a scaffold has been fabricated to support wide variety of stem cells for different tissue engineering applications, such as cartilage, bone, adipose, etc. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt at exploiting such systems for intestinal stem cell culture which permit cellular remodeling and tissue regeneration of a primary human intestinal epithelium in vitro.",
                                "Comparison of the gene expression of intestinal epithelial markers over time by qRT-PCR between HIE-derived, hInEpiC-derived and cell line-derived epithelia revealed distinctions between these cell lineages (FIG. 10). In the three epithelia, the differentiated HIE-derived epithelium was characterized by the highest biological complexity with the highest expression of major marker transcripts. By contrast, cell lines are of cancer cell origin and can only represent one cell population of human intestine. Interestingly, though hInEpiCs are primary cells directly isolated from human tissues and express most intestinal epithelial markers, the overall gene expression levels of hInEpiC-derived epithelium were found to be lower than that of the HIE-derived epithelium. This result is in contrast with findings where marker expression of primary intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal stem cell-derived epithelial cells were on the same order of magnitude. This inconsistency could be due to the source and passage of the primary cells used in the study. To obtain high enough cell numbers for scaffold seeding, we used cells from passage 2 after purchase from the vendor. Primary human cells tend to lose their genotype with passage in culture. With this consideration, the lower expression of intestinal marker genes in the hInEpiC-derived epithelium could be explained by the loss of cell genotype during passaging. These results indicate that human stem cell-derived enteroids may be the best choice for in vitro remodeling of human intestinal epithelium.",
                                "Low oxygen tension is critical for intestinal tissue function, as it is required for maintenance of a healthy gut microbial community. In vitro generation and dynamic control of oxygen gradients mimicking in vivo intestinal tissue, which vary from the anaerobic lumen across the epithelium into the highly vascularized sub-epithelium, has been a challenge for bioengineering and tissue regeneration.",
                                "In an effort to overcome this challenge, we developed a 3D tubular silk scaffold system for intestine engineering in which cells are seeded on the luminal surface, which provides stable access to the full range of oxygen conditions but without exposure to a low oxygenated cultivation atmosphere. In this Example, we take advantage of the luminal geometry to cultivate HIEs. Similar to cell line-derived intestinal models, the 3D in vitro HIE-derived intestinal models were also capable of reaching microaerobic, nanaerobic or anaerobic conditions in a standard CO2 incubator (21% O2, 5% CO2, 37\u00b0 C.) (FIG. 13). Under physiological conditions, the intestinal mucosa experiences frequent and wide fluctuations in blood perfusion and metabolism. For example, the villus oxygen tension in the murine small intestine is reported as being \u02dc2% under normal condition but decreases to \u02dc0.5% during glucose absorption. During acute or early stage gastrointestinal tract infections, pathogenic microorganisms and toxins, which enter the intestinal lumen and disrupt the mucous layer, trigger or exaggerate imbalances in tissue oxygen supply and demand. The bioengineered oxygen profiles and outcomes in vitro provide opportunities to study the role of oxygen concentrations in a wide variety of biological scenarios such as physiological stresses and pathological stimuli.",
                                "While the tissue characteristics of the HIE-derived primary epithelium on 3D scaffolds are very encouraging based on intestinal marker expression and low luminal oxygen profiles, it was unclear how capable these cells are of activating immune defenses when exposed to bacterial infections. To investigate this, we challenged the 3D intestine tissues with laboratory E. coli to determine if and how they respond to a well-known intestinal pathogen. Human intestines are constantly exposed to a vast number and diversity of bacteria. To cope with the substantial microbial threats, the intestinal epithelium uses defense mechanisms which involve the activation of a number of microbial recognition and innate immune pathways, the secretion of diverse proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and antimicrobial proteins to kill or prevent the growth of bacteria in infected tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that HIE-derived epithelia exhibit significant antibacterial responses, as evidenced by the increased expression of genes with important roles in pathogen recognition and the activation of immune responses, including microbial sensor genes, cytokines, inflammatory mediator genes, downstream signal transduction genes, and inflammasome signaling genes (FIG. 14). Interestingly, many of these genes are activated in the intestinal tissues of IBD patients. For example, IBD patients have increased mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6, in the distal colon during colitis; CRP (C-reactive protein) is a clinical biomarker of IBD, as patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have elevated CRP; cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-1B and CXCL2, were upregulated in active IBD patients at diagnosis and during therapy; the enhancement of both NOD1 and NOD2 mRNAs was detected in tissue biopsies from IBD patients; the TNF serum level was significantly increased in IBD patients compared to healthy controls; expression of SLPI mRNA are higher in patients with ulcerative colitis than in healthy controls or patients with Crohn's disease. Strikingly, multiple upregulated genes identified in the infected HIE-derived epithelium, including TLR6, CRP, CXCL12, SLPI, were not changed or only slightly upregulated in the infected hInEpiC-derived and cell line-derived epithelia. It has been reported that infection with E. coli triggers an immune response that may cause uncontrolled inflammation that occurs in Crohn's disease and other types of IBD. The results presented here suggested that the HIE-derived primary 3D intestinal epithelium not only replicates many in vivo characteristics of the human intestine, but also closely reflects the human innate immune response to bacterial infection, which may permit the in vitro study of host-microbe-pathogen interplay and pathogenesis of IBD.",
                                "In conclusion, this Example demonstrates the possibility of growing human intestinal enteroid-derived primary epithelial cells in vitro in a biocompatible 3D tubular silk scaffold system. Since HIEs are intestinal stem cells-derived, they can differentiate into all relevant intestinal epithelial cell types (enterocytes, Goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells) required to recreate a physiologically relevant system. Importantly, HIEs are directly isolated from native intestine tissues donated by individual patients, which allow this system to study patient-specific disease mechanisms and drug responses. Moreover, the 3D primary intestinal epithelium tissue model closely mimics natural human infection. This promising feature will provide the basis for acute and chronic studies of interactions between the mammalian cells, bacterial infectious agents and the study of antibiotic resistance."

This system is a major advance from previously known organoid cultures, which are limited due to necrosis, sustainability and lack of compartmentalization control, among other factors. Previously known intestinal systems for studying the enteric nervous system rely on in vivo murine and embryonic chick systems, and in vitro 2D cell culture, or organoid models, with little focus on adult cell interactions and microbiome crosstalk. In contrast, some embodiments of the present invention provide in vitro 3D human innervated intestinal tissues that encompasses both human induced neural stem cells (hiNSCs) differentiated into pertinent enteric nervous system neural cell types, as well as enterocyte-like (Caco-2) and goblet-like (HT29-MTX) cells that create the intestinal epithelial layer that is both robust and capable of long term culture.

These cells expressed neural crest migration capabilities and were seen to have migrated to the intestine of D14 chicken embryos after injection into the neural tube at D3 (FIG. 15). In addition, we have generated a 3D intestine model capable of months-long sustained access to these intestinal functions in vitro that ensures a reliable ex vivo tissue system for studies in a broad context of human intestinal diseases and treatments (Chen et al., 2016). Although this in vitro system recapitulates many intestinal functions, including continuous mucus accumulation, that lack of an enteric nervous system limits the functionality.
