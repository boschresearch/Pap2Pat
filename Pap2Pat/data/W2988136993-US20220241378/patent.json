                        "Autophagy is the process mediating lysosomal degradation of target materials in the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is critical for sensing microorganisms or their metabolic products by translating the signaling host physiological responses at mucosal surfaces. Thus, autophagy may play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Genetic studies of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have revealed important roles for autophagy pathway proteins in intestinal immune homeostasis.",
                        "LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) is a non-canonical autophagy pathway that may be activated during phagocytosis upon recognition of microbes recognition receptors. Different from canonical autophagy, LAP is activated during phagocytosis upon recognition of microbes by pattern recognition receptors for rapid pathogen degradation. The efficient clearance of the infectious cargo promoted by LAP could by itself be sufficient to reduce the inflammatory response, and hence immunopathology. However, a mechanism by which inflammation is regulated during LAP has been recently described and involves the death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). LAP may be regulated by DAPK1. IFN-\u03b3 activation of DAPK1 has been shown to mediate LAP to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus with concomitant inhibition of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), resulting in mitigation of pathogenic inflammation.",
                        "A granuloma is a structure formed during inflammation that is found in many diseases. It is a collection of immune cells known as macrophages. Granulomas (also referred to as granulomata) form when the immune system attempts to wall off substances it perceives as foreign but is unable to eliminate. Such substances include infectious organisms including bacteria and fungi, as well as other materials such as keratin and suture fragments. Granulomas are associated with various diseases, disorders and conditions including, but not limited to cat-scratch disease, granuloma annulare, cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis, leprosy, Listeria monocytogenes, aspiration pneumonia, Foreign-body granuloma, childhood granulomatous periorificial dermatitis, pneumocystis pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic Fever, sarcoidosis, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis.",
                        "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a heritable immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the proteins forming the NAPDH complex that results in defective production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired microbial killing by phagocytic cells and increased susceptibility to infections. This leads to the formation of painful granulomas in the affected areas. DAPK1 activity is defective in human and murine CGD. Characterization of CGD shows severe recurrent bacterial and other anti-inflammatory disorders such as non-infections severe colitis. Because although severe colitis is common in these patients and subclinical colitis is also evident in most asymptomatic patients, this suggests a dysregulated immune homeostasis at mucosal surfaces in CGD. A common feature of CGD patients is the presence of a hyperinflammatory state in multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract, lungs, and eyes to which inflammation caused by defective LAP greatly contributes.",
                        "The generation of ROS by the influx of neutrophils during infection is accompanied by local oxygen consumption that results in a condition known as inflammatory hypoxia, with stabilization of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)\u03b1 and resolution of inflammation. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the colonic mucosa and the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 in the induction of angiogenesis- and glycolysis-related genes as well as genes involved in mucosal barrier protection has been validated in animal models of colitis and in human-derived colonic tissue. Consistent with the role of ROS in inflammatory hypoxia, the majority of CGD patients manifest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like symptoms and pharmacological stabilization of HIF1\u03b1 within the mucosa protected CGD mice from severe colitis.",
                        "Although the contribution of inflammatory hypoxia in the lung is disputed, hypoxia develops during pulmonary invasive fungal infection in models of invasive aspergillosis, including CGD mice, and HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization is required for protection. HIF-1\u03b1 mediates the autophagic process induced by a hypoxic environment. Aberrant HIF-1\u03b1 induction/stabilization in CGD patients may be causally related to the impaired autophagy. Thus, pharmacological stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 might restore LAP/DAPK1 and immune homeostasis during infection in CGD.",
                        "At present the most curative treatment for patients with X-chromosome-linked CGD (X-CGD) is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). But for many patients without an HLA-matched donor and active infections/inflammatory complications still require novel approaches. There is a need for new treatments for granulomata and CGD."

T\u03b24 is a \u03b23 amino acid thymic hormone polypeptide providing diverse intra- and extracellular activities. The amino acid sequence of T\u03b24 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,297,276 (Goldstein), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. T\u03b24 is the major actin- sequestering molecule in all eukaryotic cells and is considered to play a significant role in the cellular metabolism due to its actin-sequestering properties. Variants of T\u03b24 are disclosed throughout this disclosure for use in accordance with the disclosed treatment methods. For example, thymosin beta 4 sulfoxide is disclosed in PCT International Publication No. WO 99/49883 (Stevenson), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure further shows that both autophagy and repair were dependent on HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. Accordingly, the inventors have surprisingly discovered a method of treating CGD by administering T\u03b24 to a subject in need thereof. Because of the similarities between the proteins DAPK1 and T\u03b24, basal autophagy is not affected by LAP, yet autophagy in response to microbial signaling is promoted by this process. Controlling autophagy in this way can benefit patients with granulomatous disorders such as CGD or schistosomiasis.",

In another aspect, the survival rate is increased by at least about 20% compared to a subject not receiving the treatment. In another aspect, the survival rate is increased by at least about 30% compared to a subject not receiving the treatment. In another aspect, the survival rate is increased by at least about 40% compared to a subject not receiving the treatment. In another aspect, the survival rate is increased by at least about 50% compared to a subject not receiving the treatment.

This mechanism involves the activation of DAPK1 through LAP. As disclosed herein, experimental studies in vitro and in vivo with human cells and mice with CGD unexpectedly demonstrated that LAP using DAPK1 is promoted by T\u03b24 when in the presence of A. fumigatus. Tests were done using mice with CGD to monitor inflammation in both the lungs and intestines. Using murine cells in vitro, DAPK1 and T\u03b24 were both defective in those affected by CGD. The data show that T\u03b24 balances inflammation and growth of granulomas as seen in cases of non-infectious granulomatous disorders, e.g., due to the increase in activity of phagocytes to stop the growth of granulomas. The method of the present disclosure is useful for effecting a matrix protein synthesis process that repairs granuloma healing mechanisms with help of TGF-\u03b2 when stimulated appropriately by T\u03b24.",

                                "The ability of T\u03b24 to promote autophagy was assessed by the determining the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, widely used to monitor autophagy (Oikonomou et al., 2016) on RAW 264.7 cells exposed to live Aspergillus conidia in the presence of different concentrations of T\u03b24. T\u03b24 did not induce autophagy in unpulsed cells (FIG. 1A), but dose-dependently increased the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio in cells pulsed with conidia. This effect was observed as early as 2 hours after the exposure to the fungus (FIG. 1B). This finding suggests that T\u03b24 could be able to activate LAP. Accordingly, the experiment testing the effect of T\u03b24 on DAPK1 and Rubicon proteins, shows the expression of DAPK1 and Rubicon proteins, known to be involved in LAP, were dose-dependently increased by T\u03b24 (FIG. 1C). As a result, T\u03b24 may promote non-canonical autophagy involving DAPK1 and Rubicon.",
                                "Next, macrophages were purified from lungs of C57BL/6 and p47phox-/- mice and pulsed in vitro with A. fumigatus conidia in the presence of T\u03b24. Both autophagy and DAPK1 expression were defective in cells from p47phox-/- mice but were dose-dependently restored by T\u03b24 (FIG. 1D). T\u03b24 also increased LC3B expression in monocytes from CGD patients exposed to Aspergillus conidia in vitro (FIG. 1E). Therefore, the data suggest that T\u03b24 can restore LAP involving DAPK1 in human CGD.",
                                "In vivo models mimicking human pathology such as lung and gut inflammation were prepared. A model of lung inflammation was tested using C57BL/6 and p47phox-/- mice. The mice were infected with A. fumigatus intranasally and treated them with T\u03b24 for 7 consecutive days starting a week after the infection. LC3-II (FIG. 1F) and DAPK1 (FIG. 1G) expression were both defective in p47phox-/- mice, but restored by T\u03b24 and ablated (LC3-II) upon siT\u03b24 (FIGS. 10A and 10B). In addition, gut inflammation was tested using the same mouse model. Acute colitis in p47phox-/- mice was initiated by administering 2.5 DSS in drinking water for 7 days followed by 7 days of DSS-free autoclaved water. Subsequently, T\u03b24 was therapeutically administered daily for 7 days, after DSS treatment, at the time at which mice started to lose weight. Consistent with previous findings (de Luca et al., 2014), LC3-II (FIG. 1H) and DAPK1 (FIG. 1I) expression were both defective in the colon ofp47phox-/- mice with colitis as opposed to WT mice but restored upon treatment with T134 (FIGS. 1H and 1I).

A similar experiment using colon homogenates of p47phox-/- mice in the DSS-induced colitis model showed upregulation of these genes by T\u03b24 (FIG. 3D). These results show that HIF-1\u03b1 mediates fundamental effects of T\u03b24, including LAP and induction of genes involved in the angiogenesis and repair.

In this experiment, T\u03b24 reduced the fungal growth in the lung of both types of mice (FIG. 4A), an effect to which the ability of T134 to potentiate phagocytosis and fungal killing of effector phagocytes likely contributed (FIG. 4B), and significantly increased the survival of infected mice in that more than 50% of mice survived at the time when all untreated mice had died (FIG. 9). Gross lung pathology and histological examination was conducted on p47phox-/- mice. No signs of inflammatory lung injury and granuloma formation after T\u03b24 administration was observed (FIG. 4C). Conversely, T\u03b24 deficiency by means of siT\u03b24 administration promoted lung pathology in C57BL/6 mice (FIG. 10B). T\u03b24 treatment down-regulated NLRP3 expression in an experiment conducted with these mice (FIG. 4D) and, accordingly, reduced IL-1\u03b2, along with TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A and IFNy production, an effect negated upon siHifla treatment (FIG. 4E).",
