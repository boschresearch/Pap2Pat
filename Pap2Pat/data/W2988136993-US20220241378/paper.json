    "abstract": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a genetic disorder of the NADPH oxidase characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and hyperinflammation associated with defective autophagy and increased inflammasome activation. Herein, we demonstrate that thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24), a g-actin sequestering peptide with multiple and diverse intracellular and extracellular activities affecting inflammation, wound healing, fibrosis, and tissue regeneration, promoted in human and murine cells noncanonical autophagy, a form of autophagy associated with phagocytosis and limited inflammation via the death-associated protein kinase 1. We further show that the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)\u03b1 was underexpressed in CGD but normalized by T\u03b24 to promote autophagy and up-regulate genes involved in mucosal barrier protection. Accordingly, inflammation and granuloma formation were impaired and survival increased in CGD mice with colitis or aspergillosis upon T\u03b24 treatment or HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization. Thus, the promotion of endogenous pathways of inflammation resolution through HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization is druggable in CGD by T\u03b24.",

                "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the proteins forming the NADPH complex, which results in defective production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and increased susceptibility to infections (Rider et al, 2018). A common feature of CGD patients is the presence of a hyperinflammatory state in multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract, lungs, and eyes (Rider et al, 2018), to which inflammation caused by defective LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) greatly contributes (de Luca et al, 2014).",
                "LC3-associated phagocytosis is a noncanonical autophagy pathway that plays a key role in the process of linking signals from phagocytosis to inflammation and innate immune responses (Henault et al, 2012; Martinez et al, 2016). Different from canonical autophagy, LAP is activated during phagocytosis upon recognition of microbes by pattern recognition receptors for rapid pathogen degradation (Simon & Clarke, 2016; Sprenkeler et al, 2016). The efficient clearance of the infectious products promoted by LAP could by itself be sufficient to reduce the inflammatory response and, hence, immunopathology. However, a mechanism by which inflammation is regulated during LAP has been recently described and involves the death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) (Oikonomou et al, 2016), a kinase mediating many different cellular functions such as cell death and repair (Bialik & Kimchi, 2006; Singh et al, 2016). Activated by IFN-\u03b3, DAPK1 not only mediates LAP of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus but also concomitantly inhibits nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) activation, thus restraining pathogenic inflammation (Oikonomou et al, 2016). Of interest, DAPK1 activity was defective in murine and human CGD (Oikonomou et al, 2016), a finding suggesting that the LAP/DAPK1 axis may represent a druggable pathway in CGD (Oikonomou et al, 2018).",
                "Besides participating in direct microbial killing, the generation of ROS by the influx of neutrophils during infection is accompanied by local oxygen consumption that results in a condition known as inflammatory hypoxia, with stabilization of the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)\u03b1 and resolution of inflammation (Campbell et al, 2014). This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the colonic mucosa, and the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 in the induction of angiogenesis- and glycolysis-related genes as well as genes involved in mucosal barrier protection has been validated in animal models of colitis and in human-derived colonic tissue (Campbell & Colgan, 2019). Consistent with the role of ROS in inflammatory hypoxia, most CGD patients manifest inflammatory bowel disease\u2013like symptoms (Campbell & Colgan, 2019), and pharmacological stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 within the mucosa protected CGD mice from severe colitis (Campbell et al, 2014). Although the contribution of inflammatory hypoxia in the lung is disputed (Taylor & Colgan, 2017), hypoxia develops during pulmonary invasive fungal infection in models of invasive aspergillosis, including CGD mice (Grahl et al, 2011), and HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization is required for protection (Shepardson et al, 2014). Of note, HIF-1\u03b1 mediates the autophagic process induced by a hypoxic environment (Bellot et al, 2009), thus raising the interesting hypothesis that a defective HIF-1\u03b1 induction/stabilization in CGD patients might be causally related to the impaired autophagy and that pharmacological stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 might restore LAP/DAPK1 and immune homeostasis during infection with CGD.",
                "Thymosin \u03b24 (T\u03b24) is a major g-actin sequestering peptide found in eukaryotic cells and represents 70\u201380% of the total thymosin content in human tissues. It is an active peptide with 43 amino acids with moonlighting properties and multiple and diverse intracellular and extracellular activities (Goldstein et al, 2005). Several physiological properties of T\u03b24 have been reported, including the regulation of wound healing, inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue regeneration (Goldstein et al, 2012). The circumstantial evidence points to T\u03b24 as a potential molecule that could link HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization to LAP in CGD. First, T\u03b24 promotes HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization (Oh et al, 2008; Jo et al, 2010; Oh & Moon, 2010) and, in turn, HIF-1\u03b1 may transcriptionally regulate T\u03b24 expression (Ryu et al, 2014). Second, T\u03b24 is the major actin-sequestering molecule in all eukaryotic cells (Ballweber et al, 2002) and the actin networks contribute to autophagosome formation and membrane remodeling during autophagy (Aguilera et al, 2012), which suggests a possible role for T\u03b24 in autophagy.",
                "Based on these premises, in the present study, we have resorted to in vitro and in vivo studies involving human cells and mice with CGD to provide evidence that T\u03b24 promotes LAP involving DAPK1 in murine and human CGD although concomitantly impairing granuloma formation in the lung and gut of mice with CGD. Both autophagy and repair were dependent on HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization, in the lung and likely in the gut, a finding qualifying T\u03b24 as a promising peptide with beneficial effects in CGD through the promotion of endogenous pathways of autophagy and inflammation resolution."

                        "In order to assess the ability of T\u03b24 to promote autophagy, we first evaluated the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, widely used to monitor autophagy (Oikonomou et al, 2016), on RAW264.7 cells exposed to live Aspergillus conidia in the presence of different concentrations of T\u03b24. We have already shown that internalized conidia undergo swelling and concomitantly induce autophagy in these cells (de Luca et al, 2014; Oikonomou et al, 2016). Immunoblotting revealed that T\u03b24, although not inducing autophagy in unpulsed cells (Fig 1A), dose-dependently increased the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio in cells pulsed with conidia, an effect observed as early as 2 h after the exposure to the fungus (Fig 1B). This finding suggests that T\u03b24 could be able to activate LAP. To confirm this, the expression of DAPK1 and Rubicon proteins, known to be involved in LAP (Martinez et al, 2016), was dose-dependently increased by T\u03b24 (Fig 1C), a finding suggesting that T\u03b24 promotes noncanonical autophagy involving DAPK1 and Rubicon. This result prompted us to assess the ability of T\u03b24 to restore LAP in CGD, in vitro and in vivo. To this purpose, we purified macrophages from the lungs of C57BL/6 and p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice and pulsed them in vitro with A. fumigatus conidia in the presence of T\u03b24. Consistent with previous findings (de Luca et al, 2014; Oikonomou et al, 2016), both autophagy and DAPK1 expression were defective in the cells from p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice but were dose-dependently restored by T\u03b24 (Fig 1D). Confirming the murine observation, T\u03b24 also increased LC3B expression in monocytes from CGD patients exposed to Aspergillus conidia in vitro (Fig 1E), a finding suggesting that T\u03b24 is able to restore LAP involving DAPK1 in human CGD. For in vivo, we resorted to two different experimental models that mimic the human pathology, such as lung and gut inflammation. To this purpose, we infected C57BL/6 and p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice with A. fumigatus intranasally and treated them with T\u03b24 for 7 consecutive days starting a week after the infection. LC3-II (Fig 1F) and DAPK1 (Fig 1G) expression were both defective in p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice but restored by T\u03b24 and ablated (LC3-II) upon siT\u03b24 (Fig S1). For gut inflammation, we resorted to the acute colitis in p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice by administering 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 d followed by 7 d of DSS-free autoclaved water. T\u03b24 was therapeutically administered daily for 7 d, after DSS treatment, at the time at which mice started to lose weight. The DSS treatment has been reported to repress Dapk1 gene expression in colonic epithelial cells (Takeshima et al, 2012). Consistent with previous findings (de Luca et al, 2014), LC3-II (Fig 1H) and DAPK1 (Fig 1I) expression were both defective in the colon of p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice with colitis as opposed to WT mice but restored upon treatment with T\u03b24 (Fig 1H and I)."

                        "Given that the defective LAP in CGD is amenable to restoration by T\u03b24, we wonder whether the production of T\u03b24 could be defective in CGD. To this purpose, we assessed T\u03b24 gene and protein expression in p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice. We found a lower expression of T\u03b24 in CGD lungs than that in C57BL/6 mice, both in terms of gene and protein expression, as revealed by real-time (RT) PCR and immunoblotting (Fig 2A) and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig 2B). Given the reciprocal regulation between T\u03b24 and HIF-1\u03b1 (Oh et al, 2008; Ryu et al, 2014), we assessed whether defective T\u03b24 levels in CGD mice could be associated with altered HIF-1\u03b1 expression. This turned out to be the case, as HIF-1\u03b1 levels were reduced in CGD mice (Fig 2C and D) and T\u03b24 ablation decreased HIF-1\u03b1 in C57BL/6 mice (Fig S1A). Interestingly, administration of T\u03b24 could restore HIF-1\u03b1 levels in CGD mice (Fig 2E and F), whereas HIF-1\u03b1 silencing decreased T\u03b24 expression (Fig 2B). Defective T\u03b24 expression (Fig 2G) and restoration of HIF-1\u03b1 expression upon administration of T\u03b24 (Fig 2H) were also observed in the colon. Consistent with the murine results, T\u03b24 also increased HIF-1\u03b1 expression in monocytes from CGD patients challenged with Aspergillus conidia (Fig 2I), thus suggesting that T\u03b24 is able to restore HIF-1\u03b1 expression in human CGD. These results indicate that intracellular autocrine crosstalk between T\u03b24 expression and HIF-1\u03b1 induction occurs in CGD."

                        "To assess whether a causal link exists between HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and induction of autophagy by T\u03b24, we first observed that T\u03b24 induced the expression in vitro of Bnip3 and Bnip3l, known to be involved in hypoxia-induced autophagy (Bellot et al, 2009) (Fig S2A). To assess this in vivo, we infected p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice with A. fumigatus intranasally and treated them with T\u03b24 in the presence or absence of siRNA for HIF-1\u03b1. The restoration of LC3-II (Fig S2B) expression in p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice by T\u03b24 was abrogated by HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition, thus indicating that T\u03b24 requires HIF-1\u03b1 to induce LAP. Moreover, as HIF-1\u03b1 is also directly involved in mucosal barrier protection in hypoxia (Campbell & Colgan, 2019), this would predict a role for T\u03b24 in mucosal protection. To prove this, we selected genes known to be regulated by HIF-1\u03b1 and measured their levels in vivo after treatment with T\u03b24. Our screening revealed that genes involved in angiogenic signaling (Angpt2, Tie2, and Vegfa), remodeling (Fgf2), hormonal regulation (Epo), and cell migration (Cxcr4) were all up-regulated in the lungs of Aspergillus-infected mice upon treatment with T\u03b24 (Fig S2C). A similar up-regulation occurred in colons of p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice in the DSS-induced colitis model (Fig S2D). Strikingly, treatment with HIF-1\u03b1 siRNA completely abrogated the up-regulation induced by T\u03b24 in the lung (Fig S2C). Overall, our results indicate that HIF-1\u03b1 mediates fundamental effects of T\u03b24, in the lung and likely in the gut, including LAP and induction of genes involved in the angiogenesis and repair, thus pointing to the T\u03b24-HIF-1\u03b1 axis as a potential therapeutic pathway in CGD."

                        "These results would anticipate a beneficial effect of T\u03b24 in diseased CGD mice. To this purpose, we evaluated the effect of T\u03b24 in mice with aspergillosis and colitis. The p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice are known to be highly susceptible to pulmonary aspergillosis and inflammation (Romani et al, 2008). Mice were monitored for fungal growth, antifungal activity of effector cells, survival, lung histopathology, and innate and adaptive Th immunity. Thymosin \u03b24 reduced the fungal growth in the lung of both types of mice (Fig 3A), an effect to which the ability of T\u03b24 to potentiate phagocytosis and fungal killing of effector phagocytes likely contributed (Fig 3B), and significantly increased the survival of infected mice, being more that 50% of mice survived at the time of which all the untreated mice have died (Fig 3C). Impressively, in p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice, gross lung pathology and histological examination (Fig 3D) revealed no signs of inflammatory lung injury and granuloma formation after T\u03b24 administration. Conversely, T\u03b24 deficiency by means of siT\u03b24 administration promoted lung pathology in C57BL/6 mice (Fig S1B). Consistent with the finding that resistance to infection could be restored in these mice by dampening inflammation through NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 blocking (de Luca et al, 2014; Iannitti et al, 2016), T\u03b24 down-regulated NLRP3 expression in these mice (Fig 3E) and, accordingly, reduced IL-1\u03b2, along with TNF-\u03b1, IL-17A, and increased IFN-\u03b3 production, an effect negated upon siHif1\u03b1 treatment (Fig 3F). Pathogenic Th2/Th17/Th9 cell responses were down-regulated and protective Th1/Treg cell responses promoted upon T\u03b24 treatment (data not shown). Strikingly, the effects on tissue pathology (Fig 3D) and inflammasome expression (Fig 3E) were all abolished by treatment with HIF-1\u03b1 siRNA, further strengthening the relevance of HIF-1\u03b1 in mediating T\u03b24 effects. These results suggest that T\u03b24 ameliorates inflammation and granuloma formation in the CGD lung via HIF-1\u03b1. In the murine colitis model, mice were evaluated a day after T\u03b24 treatment for weight loss, colon histology, cytokine levels, and tight junction gene expression. Consistent with previous findings (de Luca et al, 2014; Falcone et al, 2016), p47phox\u2013/\u2013mice lost more weight than C57BL/6 mice (about 50% loss of their initial body weight on day 14) (Fig 4A) and had more severe colitis as observed by significantly increased disease activity index scores (Fig 4B). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of colon sections showed severe patchy inflammation characterized by transmural lymphocytic infiltrates, epithelial ulceration, and complete crypt loss (Fig 4C). In addition, p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice displayed high levels of NLRP3 expression (Fig 4D) and IL-1\u03b2 production (Fig 4E), along with high levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17A (Fig 4F) and low levels of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig 4G). Treatment with T\u03b24 significantly led to weight regain (Fig 4A), decreased disease activity index scores (Fig 4B), amelioration of inflammatory pathology and tissue architecture (Fig 4C), decreased NLRP3 expression (Fig 4D) and inflammatory cytokine levels (Fig 4E and F), and up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines (Fig 4G). Of interest, T\u03b24 greatly promoted the expression of both Cldn1 and Ocln, tight junction proteins that regulate intestinal permeability (Gunzel & Yu, 2013; Kyoko et al, 2014) (Fig 4H), thus suggesting a positive effect on the mucosal barrier function. The protective effect of T\u03b24 also occurred when treatment was given concomitantly with DSS (that is, from day 0 to day 7 [Fig S3]), a finding suggesting that prophylactic T\u03b24 is also beneficial. Altogether, these results suggest that T\u03b24, by activating LAP-DAPK1 and inhibiting inflammasome activity, could have beneficial effects on the outcome of colitis in CGD."

For this reason, given the well-known beneficial effects of HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization on disease outcomes and barrier function in animal models of intestinal inflammation (Colgan et al, 2015), we treated p47phox\u2013/\u2013 mice with aspergillosis with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG)\u2014a cell-permeable competitive inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) that stabilizes HIF-1\u03b1 (Mole et al, 2003)\u2014for 5 d. Similar to T\u03b24, DMOG reduced fungal burden (Fig 5A), ameliorated lung pathology (Fig 5B), increased HIF-1\u03b1 expression (Fig 5C), and up-regulated HIF-1\u03b1-responsive genes (Fig 5D).

                "The results of the present study show that T\u03b24 restored autophagy and up-regulated hypoxia-responsive genes in human and murine CGD and this resulted in amelioration of disease pathology (Fig 5E). The increased autophagy, epithelial barrier protection, and repair induced by T\u03b24 are consistent with its antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects (Kumar & Gupta, 2011) and represents a plausible mechanism through which inflammation and granuloma formation are balanced in CGD by T\u03b24. It is clear that the innate immune system is pivotal in orchestrating granuloma formation in response to microbial and foreign body challenge (Petersen & Smith, 2013). Impaired antibacterial autophagy links inflammation to granuloma formation in intestinal diseases (Lassen & Xavier, 2018). By promoting LAP, T\u03b24 may successfully contribute to pathogen elimination, thus clearly preventing granuloma formation. Thus, the beneficial activity of T\u03b24 may encompass a possible activity on the microbial composition at different body sites. Moreover, by inducing TGF-\u03b2 (Sosne et al, 2004)\u2014known to modulate the fibrotic repair process accompanying granuloma healing (Limper et al, 1994)\u2014T\u03b24 may impair granuloma formation. However, excess TGF-\u03b2 activity, by preventing effective granuloma formation, may interfere with antimicrobial mechanisms (Toossi et al, 1995). Thus, whether the high levels of TGF-\u03b2 (Toossi et al, 1995) and T\u03b24 (Kang et al, 2014) observed in granulomatous lung lesions or colorectal cancer (Gemoll et al, 2015) are the cause or effect of defective granuloma formation needs clarification.",
                "In lung aspergillosis, and likely in DSS-induced colitis, the effects of T\u03b24 were dependent on HIF-1\u03b1 that mediated not only the induction of autophagy but also the up-regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes. Interestingly, T\u03b24 up-regulated HIF-1\u03b1\u2013dependent genes, involved in barrier protection and angiogenesis and not in glycolysis, are known to contribute to inflammation in myeloid cells (Palazon et al, 2014) (Fig S4A), thus suggesting the unique ability of T\u03b24 to activate physiologic HIF-1\u03b1 to resolve inflammation. HIF-1\u03b1 can be regulated by both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms in hypoxic and normoxic conditions, respectively, and strategies are being studied to either activate or inhibit the activity of HIF-1\u03b1 depending on the clinical setting (Giaccia et al, 2003; Yee Koh et al, 2008). Indeed, whereas HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition is recognized as an antitumor therapeutic strategy, up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 is critical in the treatment of ischemic states (Giaccia et al, 2003; Yee Koh et al, 2008). In the context of CGD, HIF-1\u03b1 was underexpressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa and lung, suggesting that a potential therapy for CGD should include the elevation of HIF-1\u03b1 levels to restore the hypoxia-mediated tissue homeostasis and the optimal antimicrobial response. It has indeed been reported that hypoxia and HIF proteins are required for protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro (Schaible et al, 2013) and against A. fumigatus in vivo (Shepardson et al, 2014).",
                "The dependency of T\u03b24 activity on HIF-1\u03b1 in lung aspergillosis, and likely in DSS-induced colitis, underpins a more general relationship between the two molecules. In agreement with the published literature (Oh et al, 2008; Ryu et al, 2014), we found that T\u03b24 and HIF-1\u03b1 crossregulate their reciprocal expression being the levels of HIF-1\u03b1 defective in CGD mice but restored by T\u03b24 and, conversely, silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 in wild-type mice being associated with reduced levels of T\u03b24. Several mechanisms might underlie the ability of T\u03b24 to regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Thymosin \u03b24 may inhibit PHDs that target HIF-1\u03b1 to degradation. Prolyl hydroxylases can be inhibited through succinate upon accumulation by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (Selak et al, 2005). Interestingly, in the mouse model of lung inflammation, T\u03b24 increased the levels of Irg1 (Fig S4B), the enzyme responsible for the production of the anti-inflammatory mediator itaconate, an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (Lampropoulou et al, 2016), thus raising the intriguing possibility that T\u03b24, by regulating succinate levels, might modulate the levels of HIF-1\u03b1 via PHDs. However, it has been reported that itaconate may also down-regulate HIF-1\u03b1 levels (Lampropoulou et al, 2016). Alternatively, T\u03b24 might stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), as previously reported (Oh & Moon, 2010). Indeed, we could detect production of mtROS from isolated alveolar macrophages challenged with conidia and treated with T\u03b24 (Fig S4C and D), thus supporting the hypothesis that mtROS might mediate the regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 levels by T\u03b24. The ability of T\u03b24 to induce mtROS is reminiscent of the activity of pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonist, currently approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 and recently proposed as a therapeutic molecule for CGD (Migliavacca et al, 2016). In normal phagocytes, PPAR\u03b3 activation linked NADPH oxidase activity with enhanced mtROS production (Fernandez-Boyanapalli et al, 2010), but this mechanism was defective in CGD. Peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 agonists, such as pioglitazone, could bypass the need for the NADPH oxidase for enhanced mtROS production and partially restored host defense in CGD. Given that pioglitazone is currently in a phase1/phase2 trial in CGD patients with severe infection (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03080480), it will be intriguing to assess whether endogenous T\u03b24 is involved in the clinical efficacy of pioglitazone.",
                "Whatever the mechanism by which T\u03b24 regulates HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the recent finding that HIF-1\u03b1 reprograms ILC3 metabolism for mucosal barrier protection (Di Luccia et al, 2019), offers a further plausible explanation for the protective function of T\u03b24 at the mucosal level.",
                "In conclusion, by unraveling the biological activity of T\u03b24 in CGD, this study points to the relevance of mtROS production and HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization as druggable pathways promoting autophagy and repair in CGD."

Thymosin \u03b24 was administered i.p. at a dose of 5 mg/kg as an effective dose as described (Badamchian et al, 2003), every day in concomitance with (days 0\u21927) or after (days 7\u219214) infection.

Intranasal siRNA was given once the day before infection and 1, 3, and 5 d after infection (Iannitti et al, 2013b). It is known that lung-specific siRNA delivery can be achieved by intranasal administration without the use of viral vectors or transfection agents in vivo (Iannitti et al, 2013a). Mice were euthanized 7 or 14 d postinfection. Fungal burden was determined by quantitative PCR and expressed as conidial equivalents. Lung tissue was aseptically removed and homogenized in 3 ml of sterile saline. Lung homogenates were subjected to a secondary homogenization step with 0.5 mm glass beads in Bead Beater homogenizer (Gemini BV) and then processed for DNA extraction with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Fungal burden was quantified by quantitative PCR by using the sequences for the multicopy 18S ribosomal DNA gene.
