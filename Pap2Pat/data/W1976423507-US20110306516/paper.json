    "title": "Improved Methods for Reprogramming Human Dermal Fibroblasts Using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting",
    "date": "2013-03-29",
    "abstract": "Current methods to derive induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from human dermal fibroblasts by viral infection rely on expensive and lengthy protocols. One major factor contributing to the time required to derive lines is the ability of researchers to identify fully reprogrammed unique candidate clones from a mixed cell population containing transformed or partially reprogrammed cells and fibroblasts at an early time point post infection. Failure to select high quality colonies early in the derivation process results in cell lines that require increased maintenance and unreliable experimental outcomes. Here, we describe an improved method for the derivation of iPSC lines using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate single cells expressing the cell surface marker signature CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS on day 7\u201310 after infection. This technique prospectively isolates fully reprogrammed iPSCs, and depletes both parental and \u201ccontaminating\u201d partially reprogrammed fibroblasts, thereby substantially reducing the time and reagents required to generate iPSC lines without the use of defined small molecule cocktails. FACS derived iPSC lines express common markers of pluripotency, and possess spontaneous differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo. To demonstrate the suitability of FACS for high-throughput iPSC generation, we derived 228 individual iPSC lines using either integrating (retroviral) or non- integrating (Sendai virus) reprogramming vectors and performed extensive characterization on a subset of those lines. The iPSC lines used in this study were derived from 76 unique samples from a variety of tissue sources, including fresh or frozen fibroblasts generated from biopsies harvested from healthy or disease patients.",

                "The discovery that differentiated somatic cells could be reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state by forced expression of four transcription factors (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, cMyc) has revolutionized the stem cell field [1]. Reprogrammed, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), show remarkable similarities to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and hold great promise for in vitro disease modeling, drug discovery, and therapeutic interventions because they provide a potentially unlimited source of differentiated cells from individuals with specific diseases [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].",
                "However, initial derivation of stable iPSC clones by viral transduction of dermal fibroblasts is a slow (4\u20136 weeks) and inefficient (\u22640.01% of total fibroblasts) process. Current methods of identifying colonies of bona fide iPSCs early in the reprogramming process (2\u20133 weeks post-infection) utilize light microscopy and manual isolation of candidate colonies, which requires training and expertise in advanced cell culture techniques. To enable future clinical applications requiring de novo iPSC derivation, there remains a need for standardized and validated methods for identifying, isolating and purifying reprogrammed cells.",
                "Previous imaging studies based on tracking of cell-of-origin suggest that early events occur during defined factor reprogramming, including a change in cell proliferation rates and morphology [7], downregulation of CD13, a marker of mesenchymal cells including fibroblasts [8], as well as upregulation of the cell surface markers of pluripotency SSEA4 and TRA-1-60 [9]. These studies demonstrate that both partially and fully reprogrammed iPSCs can be identified by combined use of surface expression of multiple markers. Recently, a method of enriching reprogrammed fibroblasts by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for cells with dual expression of the pluripotency surface markers SSEA4 and TRA-1-81 arising late during reprogramming was described [10]. While a step forward, this method relies heavily on the use of a defined small molecule cocktail, and multiple rounds of sorting and extensive screening to identify fully reprogrammed clones. This suggests that pluripotency markers alone are not sufficient to purify fully reprogrammed iPSCs. Additionally, it is likely that the high variability among clones seen within this population is compounded by the use of integrating vectors to deliver the reprogramming factors. Here, we confirm that throughout the reprogramming process a significant proportion of SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells retain the fibroblast surface marker, CD13. Through the use of negative selection against CD13, we were able to purify fully reprogrammed iPSCs from partially reprogrammed cells and parental fibroblasts by FACS. This method removes contaminating cells at an early stage and can be used with a variety of cell populations including: cells reprogrammed with DNA-integrating or non-integrating viruses; fibroblasts harvested from healthy or specific disease patients. Using this method we have generated and characterized 228 iPSC lines from 76 fibroblast lines obtained from multiple sources including fresh biopsies, frozen stocks, and cell line repositories."

These studies suggest that isolation of fully reprogrammed iPSCs during early stages of reprogramming may be accomplished by FACS using a combination of positive and negative surface markers. While current sorting strategies for purification of pluripotent cells rely on positive selection [7], it is possible that a significant proportion of clones isolated using this method may not be fully reprogrammed. To test this hypothesis we first optimized the conditions for survival of live-cell sorted, fully reprogrammed cells by examining the expression levels of three surface markers in a manually derived, early passage clone (p4) of an iPSC line (1018) cultured on MEFs.",
                        "Populations of cells expressing all three markers were found in the culture suggesting a heterogeneous mixture of cells containing parental and partially reprogrammed fibroblasts  Figure 1A . We then sorted the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS (Tra-1-60POS) population and, as a control, the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60NEG (Tra-1-60NEG) population to approximately 70% purity directly into one well of a 6 well plate containing MEFs in the presence of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. The sorted populations were maintained for 20 days on MEFs without ROCK inhibitor or removal of differentiated cells or splitting prior to reanalysis by flow cytometry (FCM). At 20 days post-sorting (dps), the cultures originating from the enriched Tra-1-60POS population contained fewer Tra-1-60NEG differentiated cells and no detectable CD13POS parental fibroblasts. The Tra-1-60POS population was present in these cultures at approximately double the proportion found in the Tra-1-60NEG enriched culture (30% vs. 14%). Conversely, at 20 dps the culture originating from the Tra-1-60NEG enriched population contained a Tra-1-60POS population at a similar proportion to the originally sorted culture (18%T vs. 14%T). However, these cultures also contained a higher proportion of differentiated or transformed cells (CD13NEGSSEA4NEGTra-1-60NEG) as well as adult fibroblasts (CD13POS) suggesting that our FACS conditions allow for purification of fully reprogrammed cells from contaminating cell types.",
                        "To confirm this strategy, adult skin fibroblasts at 8 days post infection (dpi) were sorted based on the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS surface marker profile. As a control, the CD13NEGSSEA4POS population that contained two subpopulations of cells expressing either Tra-1-60POS or Tra-1-60NEG was isolated in parallel. 5,000 or 10,000 cells from each population were sorted directly into MEF-containing plates, and monitored for the formation of colonies. Small but distinct colonies were evident in both sorted populations as early as 3 days post sort (dps), with the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population producing larger and more abundant colonies than the CD13NEGSSEA4POS population (3 dps, 11 dpi;  Figure 1B ). Following an additional 2 weeks of expansion without manual removal of differentiated cells, wells containing the CD13NEGSSEA4POS population had become overgrown with transformed and differentiated cells, whereas wells containing the sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells contained large, well-separated colonies with few differentiated cells between the colonies and lacked cells with transformed morphology (17 dps, 25 dpi;  Figure 1B ). We observed a 3\u20134 fold increase in the number of colonies present in wells containing the sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells compared to the sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POS cells  Figure 1C .",
                        "We then analyzed CD13 expression within the SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population of reprogrammed fibroblasts at 7 dpi. Roughly one quarter of the SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population expressed CD13 indicating the presence of a heterogeneous population of fully reprogrammed, transformed, or transitioning cells (23% CD13POS, 66% CD13\u2212;  Figure 1D ), some of which expressed both Nanog and CD13  Figure 1E .",
                        "Because surface marker expression during reprogramming is dynamic, we wanted to first identify the earliest time point at which to enrich fully reprogrammed iPSCs. Time course analysis conducted by flow cytometry following retroviral reprograming suggested that SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells were detectable as early as 7 dpi, and their proportion increased up to 21 dpi, then remained constant as marker negative cells outgrew the reprogrammed cells Figure S1. The SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population also expressed the SSEA3 and CD326 pluripotency markers [16], [17], [18], [19]. SSEA4POSCD13POS cells appeared by 7 dpi and while most of this population disappeared by 14 dpi, a proportion remained in the culture. To test whether this timing was consistent among different skin samples, we analyzed cultures derived from a foreskin fibroblast line (0825), a healthy adult control fibroblast line (1023), and a fibroblast line from a subject with type I diabetes (1018) for up to 21 dpi. The three fibroblast cell lines showed a consistent emergence of pluripotent surface markers with SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells present at low numbers at 7 dpi (D7, 0.3%\u20130.4%  Figure 2A ), increasing in proportion at 14 dpi (D14, 1.4%\u20132.2%), and decreasing by day 21 as other cells overtook the culture (D21, 0.7%), suggesting a consistent appearance of potentially early reprogrammed cells between 7 and 14 dpi. However, at early time points, the majority of SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells also expressed CD13 (D7, 98%\u2013100%). The proportion of CD13POSSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS decreased approximately half by day 14 post infection (D14, 37%\u201354%), suggesting loss of this fibroblast marker on cells undergoing reprogramming. Interestingly, the CD13POSSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population increased again by day 21, suggesting that this population was expanding or that CD13NEG cells were lost from the culture.",
                        "Based on these results we developed the sorting strategy shown in  Figure 2B  which omits the contaminating partially reprogrammed CD13POSSSEA4POS population by selecting the highest Tra-1-60POS expressing cells within the CD13NEGSSEA4POS population. Using this strategy we FACS derived 228 individual iPSC lines from over 75 fresh or frozen fibroblast lines generated from biopsies harvested from healthy or disease patients using either integrating (retroviral) or non-integrating (Sendai virus) reprogramming vectors and performed extensive characterization on a subset of those lines which is described in the data that follows. We further characterized the first 2 weeks of the reprogramming process on 128 FACS derived iPSC lines using the analysis structure shown in  Figure 1D . As shown in  Figure 2C , a higher percentage of SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells were generated in Sendai infections compared to retroviral infections over the entire time course. However, Sendai infections demonstrated a delayed reduction in the proportion of CD13POSSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells  Figure 2D . By the second week of induction, the proportion of the CD13POS population between the cultures was similar."

First, the 0825, 1018, and 1023 fibroblast lines shown in  Figure 2A  reprogrammed using the 4-factor retroviral protocol were subjected to either FACS derivation at 7 dpi or standard picking techniques. For each method, one clone from each line was randomly selected for expansion and further characterization by a standard battery of assays, including karyotypic analysis, DNA fingerprint, pluripotent surface marker expression, qRT-PCR, and Embryoid body (EB) and teratoma formation. All fibroblasts and reprogrammed iPSC lines displayed normal karyotypes, and had DNA fingerprints matching the parental fibroblast line Figure S2. Clones from the 0825 foreskin fibroblast line had a DNA fingerprint that matched a major subpopulation in the parental fibroblasts that contained a contaminating subpopulation with a different genotype, suggesting isolation of clonal cultures from a mixed population.",
                        "Both the manually and FACS-derived iPSC lines expressed common markers of pluripotency, including the surface marker Tra-1-60 and the transcription factor Nanog, and generated compact colonies morphologically consistent with normal hESCs, Figure S3 (A\u2013B). Next, the cell lines were expanded for ten passages and the expression of endogenous Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, and Klf4, and silencing of the viral transgenes Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc were assayed. We used a probe-based Nanostring nCounter transcript quantification assay, to assess pluripotency by detecting both activation of endogenous gene expression  Figure 3A  and silencing of retroviral transgenes  Figure 3B . These data were further confirmed by qPCR Figure S3 and revealed a similar pattern of endogenous gene expression in all iPSC lines compared to undifferentiated hESC controls  Figure 3A  , Figure S3. However, two of the three manually derived clones (1018_2 and 1023_C) maintained much higher expression of the viral transgenes than the sorted clones  Figure 3B . Additionally, the 1018_2 cultures expressed CD13, indicating the presence of non-reprogrammed or partially transformed human fibroblasts in the manually picked lines  Figure 3B . These analyses suggest that selection of single cells based on CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS expression can be used to select against partially reprogrammed or contaminating cell types in reprogrammed cultures. The full data set for these experiments is provided in Table S7.",
                        "We next examined undirected EB formation to measure the in vitro differentiation potential of FACS and manually-derived iPSCs clones. Following differentiation for 5 weeks, EBs were collected and assayed for markers of three embryonic germ layers endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm by immunohistochemistry for \u03b11-fetoprotein (AFP), smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and beta III tubulin (Tuj1), respectively. EBs derived from FACS or manually picked clones expressed markers associated with formation of the three germ layers  Figure 4A\u2013B  . To further define the differentiation potential of the derived lines, RNA from the EBs were collected after two weeks of differentiation and tested against a panel of lineage-specific nCounter probes Table S4 previously validated to detect expression of genes commonly found in the three germ layers [15]  Figure 4C . With the exception of the FACS-derived 0825 line, all lines expressed comparable levels of the germ layer-associated genes, indicating they have similar potential to spontaneously differentiate in vitro into any germ layer. The full data set for these experiments is provided in Table S8.",

The resulting teratomas were sectioned and examined by H&E staining. This analysis showed that teratomas generated from sorted  Figure 4D  or manually derived  Figure 4E  clones formed all three germ layer tissues, including gut-like epithelial tissues (endoderm), cartilage (mesoderm), and retinal pigment epithelium (ectoderm). Together, these analyses validate the use of CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS expression as a surface marker signature compatible with FACS that can be used to isolate a population of fully reprogrammed iPSCs."

                        "Because iPSC lines can arise from rare apparently stochastic events at early time points during reprogramming, it was important to establish that FACS sorting could isolate multiple independent reprogramming events. To determine whether FACS derivation can produce unique cell lines in a similar manner to manual picking, we performed Southern blotting on several clones derived by both methods. Klf4 and Oct4 probes were used to identify the endogenous and virally integrated forms of the genes. Different banding patterns indicate differences in the chromosomal integration sites and, in some cases, varying numbers of detectable integration events. As shown in  Figure 3C , all three sorted clones from line 1023 have different integration sites for both Klf4 and Oct4, demonstrating they are independent clones. In contrast, two of the three picked clones from line 1023 have identical banding patterns for Klf4 and Oct4, suggesting they are the same clone. Of the iPSC lines generated from three different fibroblast lines, 8/9 FACS-derived lines were independent clones, while 7/9 manually picked lines were independent (data not shown), suggesting equivalent ability to generate clonal cultures. Therefore, FACS sorting between 7\u201314 dpi using of CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS can generate independent clonal cultures following retroviral reprogramming."

Three individual clones were chosen from each derivation method and expanded on MEFs to asses pluripotent surface marker expression by FCM at later passages. As shown in the first row of  Figure 5A\u2013B , cultures of all clones (C1\u2013C6) resulting from each derivation method possessed populations of cells positively expressing both SSEA4 and Tra-1-60 at varying proportions indicating stability at between 12\u201314 passages. Although not shown in  Figure 5 , cultures of these clones were stable at earlier (p4\u2013p11) and later (p20\u2013p25) passages. Clones C3 and C6 were adapted to matrigel and mTser media (*C3 and *C6 in Fig. 5A,B) following 11 passages on MEFS and expanded for 3\u20135 passages to demonstrate the stability of FACS derived ips lines following changes in substrate and media conditions. FCM analysis of Matrigel adapted ips lines show stable surface marker expression with less SSEA4POSTra-1-60NEG populations than the manually derived clone C6. Small populations of CD13POS expressing both Tra-1-60POS and Tra-1-60NEG (second row of  Figure 5A\u2013B ) were present in all cultures with the exception of the FACS derived C3 and *C3 clones indicating the variability present in individual clones derived under DNA integrating reprogramming techniques. Similar results are observed within clones derived using the non-integrating Sendai viral platform (Data not shown). These results demonstrate that FACS derived ips clones remain stable over multiple passages and following adaptation to feeder free conditions."

For these studies, an adult fibroblast line (131) was infected and subjected to either FACS sorting at 11 dpi or to manual derivation. At 11 dpi, the fraction of SSEA4POSTRA-1-60POS cells that were also CD13POS was significantly lower (1\u20132%, data not shown) than with retroviral reprogramming (37\u201354%,  Figure 2C ), suggesting an accelerated rate of reprogramming. As before with the retroviral lines, several clones from each derivation technique were selected and expanded for characterization following confirmation that the parent fibroblast line possessed a normal karyotype and DNA fingerprint, and was free of contaminating cell lines Figure S2.",

In addition, the sorted (SRT) and picked (PCK) clones showed comparable levels of endogenous Oct4, Sox2, KLF4, MYC, and Nanog gene expression as early as passage 5, which remained relatively constant to passage 10,  Figure 6E . Similarly, though greatly reduced compared to control infected fibroblasts, Sendai virus gene expression was slightly above background at passage 5 in one sorted and one picked clone. However, this Sendai gene expression was eliminated by passage 10 in both cases,  Figure 6F . The full data set for these experiments is provided in Table S9.",

Similar trends in gene expression were observed for clones derived under both methods,  Figure 6G . Both sorted and picked lines expressed levels of the ectodermal marker FGFR2 comparable to that of the control HUES42 line but higher levels of the mesodermal marker HHEX. Most clones showed levels of endodermal gene expression comparable to the HUES42 line with the exception of a manually derived clone that expressed higher levels of GATA6 than the remaining picked lines or FACS-derived lines. The full data set for these experiments is provided in Table S10. Collectively, these data demonstrate that using FACS to purify the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells from either retroviral or Sendai viral 4-factor reprogramming protocols consistently produces high quality iPSC lines."

                "Clinical application of iPSC technology will require standardized and reproducible methods for each step of derivation and differentiation into relevant cell types. We have found that the majority of manually derived iPSC lines contain CD13POS cells even after prolonged culture suggesting that these lines were either not fully reprogrammed or that CD13POS cells were carried over during passage. While both manual picking and FACS sorting methods [10] have been used to isolate reprogrammed pluripotent cells, we demonstrated that inclusion of a negative selection marker such as CD13 has significant advantages in improving the purity of reprogrammed cultures. This fact was previously demonstrated [13]. Here, we have validated a surface marker profile that enables selection of early reprogrammed iPSCs following reprogramming with either DNA-integrating or non-integrating viruses by FACS. Employing this strategy as early as 7 dpi isolates a highly purified starting population of fully functional CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells that are depleted of contaminating non-transduced and transformed fibroblasts. We have successfully generated and characterized 228 individual iPSC lines in 2 years from 76 fibroblast lines obtained from fresh biopsies, frozen stocks, and cell line repositories harvested from healthy and individuals possessing various forms of diabetes, neurodegenerative, cardiac and autoimmune diseases. Table S6.",
                "Moreover, we routinely use FACS for maintenance of established cell lines to remove differentiated cells and to dispense graded numbers of highly purified CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations cells for use in high-throughput derivation and screening assays which include directed differentiation and automated drug screening and phenotyping experiments. This is an important property because the results of these assays could be unequivocally attributed to a defined population of reprogrammed cells rather than to a heterogeneous mixture of cells. Taken together, these results suggest that isolation of the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population following reprogramming, including integrating or non-integrating viral technologies, allows for the rapid isolation of high quality iPSC lines. Negative selection against CD13POS cells significantly reduces the appearance of transformed cells in ipsc cultures and suggests that negative selection for a marker present on the starting somatic cells can be used to exclude non-reprogrammed or transformed cells from the cultures. Future studies will be needed to determine if this strategy applies to derivation from other somatic cell types or reprogramming methods."
