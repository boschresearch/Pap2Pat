The methods include contacting adult fibroblasts with a reprogramming composition suitable for reprogramming the adult fibroblasts to iPSC, under conditions effective for the reprogramming composition to penetrate the adult fibroblasts, followed by culturing the contacted fibroblasts for a time period sufficient for the cells to be reprogrammed. The cultured cells are then sorted to select cells based upon their expression of the cell membrane surface markers CD13NEG SSEA4POS Tra-1-60POS. iPSC colonies are then identified from the sorted cells.",

                        "Stem cells are =specialized cells that self-renew for long periods through cell division, and can be induced to differentiate into cells with specialized functions. These qualities give stem cells great promise for use in therapeutic applications to replace damaged cells and tissue in various medical conditions. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the blastocyst of an early stage embryo and have the potential to develop into endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm (the three germ layers) (i.e., they are \u201cpluripotent\u201d). In vitro, ES cells tend to spontaneously differentiate into various types of tissues, and the control of their direction of differentiation can be challenging. There are unresolved ethical concerns that are associated with the destruction of embryos in order to harvest human ES cells. These problems limit their availability for research and therapeutic applications.",
                        "Adult stem (AS) cells are found among differentiated tissues. Stem cells obtained from adult tissues typically have the potential to form a more limited spectrum of cells (i.e., \u201cmultipotent\u201d), and typically only differentiate into the cell types of the tissues in which they are found, though recent reports have shown some plasticity in certain types of AS cells. They also generally have a limited proliferation potential.",
                        "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are widely recognized as important tools for conducting medical research. Heretofore, the technology for producing iPSC has been time consuming and labor-intensive. Differentiated adult cells, e.g., fibroblasts, are reprogrammed, cultured, and allowed to form individual colonies which represent unique clones. Identifying these types of cells is difficult because the majority of the cells are not fully reprogrammed iPSC clones. The iPSC clones are then selected based on the morphology of the cells with \u201cgood\u201d colonies possesing sharply demarcated borders containing cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. When clones are identified, they are manually picked by micro thin glass tools and cultured on \u201cfeeder\u201d layers of cells typically Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF). This step is performed typically at 14-21 days post infection. Then the clones are expanded for another 14-21 days or more prior to undergoing molecular characterization.",
                        "Others have focused on developing techniques to rapidly and more accurately identify and characterize fully reprogrammed adult fibroblasts and their downstream differentiation potential (Bock et al., 2011, Cell 144: 439-452; Boulting et al., 2011, Nat Biotechnol 29: 279-286). These techniques include the use of Flow Cytometry (FC) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to identify and live sort unique subpopulations of cells as defined by unique expression patterns of surface proteins.",
                        "Although FC and FACS are firmly established techniques in the field of immunology, their use in the stem cell field is still in its infancy and few researchers are incorporating these techniques into stem cell research other than for basic multiparameter characterization of cell lines. When employing retroviral constructs in reprogramming there is an additional concern over integration of viral DNA into the host genome and the integration at multiple sites, resulting in multiple clones from the reprogramming event (polyclonalism). It has been suggested that this, and other limitations, would interfere with early detection of fully reprogrammed cells by FACS alone. See, e.g., Chan et al., 2009, Nat Biotechnol 27: 1033-1037.",
                        "Thus, stem cells are an attractive source of cells for therapeutic applications, medical research, pharmaceutical testing and the like. However, there remains a longstanding need in the art for improved methods for producing and isolating iPSC cell lines in order to meet these and other needs."

The iPSCs produced do not refer to cells as they are found in the nature.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment the methods of the invention include steps for enriching early reprogrammed fibroblasts expressing the combination of CD13NEG SSEA4POS Tra-1-60POS surface markers using FACS. The inventive methods both enrich the cells of interest and remove partially reprogrammed and adult fibroblasts and effectively reduce the time, labor, and resources required to generate stable, monoclonal iPSClines. The inventive methods are also effective in generating clones from fibroblast lines that exhibit resistance to current reprogramming technology. The inventive methods can also be applied to fibroblasts from normal and disease specific samples reprogrammed under multiple techniques, including retroviral and Sendai viral systems.",
                        "In a further preferred embodiment, the inventive methods can also be used to obtain cell populations enriched in fully reprogrammed cells, from among cells that have undergone differentiation in established iPSC cell lines that were cultured under both murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layer, as well as feeder free conditions. The inventive methods further enable the live sorting of defined subpopulations of fully-reprogrammed, or differentiated, iPSC cells into 96 well plates for use in high throughput screening campaigns.",
                        "Methods for transfecting and transforming or reprogramming adult cells to form iPSC lines are generally known, e.g., Takahashi et al., 2007 Cell, 131: 861-872, 2007, Yu et al., 2007, Science, vol. 318, pp. 1917-1920. iPSC are induced from somatic cells by introducing and expressing a combination of specific transcription factors, e.g., a combination of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc genes. Others have demonstrated that other transcription factors may be employed in transforming or reprogramming adult cells. These other transcription factors include, e.g., Lin28, Nanog, hTert and SV40 large T antigen as described, for example, by Takahashi et al., 2006 Cell, 126: 663-676 and Huiqun Yin, et al. 2009, Front. Agric. China 3(2): 199-208, incorporated by reference herein.",
                        "It has also been shown that a single transcription factor may be employed in reprogramming adult fibroblasts to iPSC with the addition of certain other small molecule pathway inhibitors. Such pathway inhibitors include e.g., the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) pathway inhibitors, SB431542 (4-[4-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-5-(2-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-benzamide), and A-83-01 [3-(6-Methyl-2-pyridinyl)-N-phenyl-4-(4-quinolinyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide], the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and microtubule-associated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway inhibitor PD0325901 (N-[(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropoxy]-3,4-difluoro-2-[(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)amino]-benzamide), the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 [6-((2-((4-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)ethyl)amino)nicotinonitrile] which activates activates Wnt signalling by stabilizing beta-catenin, the lysine-specific demethylase1 Parnate (a/k/a tranylcypromine), the small molecule activator of 3\u2032-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) PS48 [(2Z)-5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-3-phenyl-2-pentenoic acid], the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors sodium butyrate and valproic acid, small molecules that modulate mitochondrial oxidation (e.g., 2,4-dinitrophenol), glycolytic metabolism (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and oxalate), HIF pathway activation (N-oxaloylglycine and Quercetin) Zhu et al., 2010, Cell Stem Cell 7: 651-655, incorporated by reference herein it its entirety. Zhu et al showed that Oct4 combined with Parnate and CHIR99021 was sufficient to reprogram adult human epidermal keratinocytes.",
                        "Although individual protocols differ, a general reprogramming protocol consists of expanding fibroblasts from tissue samples, e.g., skin biopsies and infecting them, ie., transfecting, with e.g., expression vectors, such as viral constructs containing transcripts for pluripotent transcription factors. The fibroblasts are obtained by art-known methods, e.g., by mechanically disrupting the tissue followed by enzymatic dissociation to release the fibroblasts, and culturing the fibroblasts by art-known methods, e.g., as described by Dimos et. al., 2008, Science Vol. 321 (5893): 1218-1221.",
                        "Transfection of the fibroblasts with an expression vector is carried out according to instructions provided with the desired vector. After a time ranging from about 3 to about 7 days post-transfection, the cells are dissociated and contacted with fluorescent tagged antibodies raised against the CD13NEG, SSEA4POS and Tra-1-60POS surface markers. The dissociated and antibody-labeled cells are then resuspended in a phosphate buffered saline solution and loaded onto the FACS machine. Surface marker positive cells are sorted by tag color or absence thereof directly into sterile tubes containing tissue culture media or multiwell (6-96 well) tissue culture plates coated with MEFs or cell free biological matrices and cultured until formation of visible colonies occurs.",
                        "Colonies are then further confirmed as iPSC by light microscopic inspection of the resulting clones or optionally by microscopic fluorescence inspection of clones labeled with fluorescent tagged antibodies. Optionally, in certain embodiments, one or more of the vectors also insert a green flourescence protein (GFP) expression marker, for convenience in sorting and identification. Several individual colonies possesing morphological characteristics consistent with pluripotent ES lines are plucked from cultures and expanded individually to form monoclonal cultures.",
                        "In one preferred embodiment of the inventive method, the sorted cells are subjected to genetic analysis to provide early confirmation and identification of iPSC cells. Preferably, the genetic analysis is conducted by Southern blot, but other art-known methods may be employed which include but are not limited to MicroArray, Nano String, quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry. Detection of enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase, positive expression of the cell membrane surface markers SSEA3, SSEA4, Tra-1-60, Tra-1-81 and the expression of the KLF4, Oct3/4, Nanog, Sox2 transcription factors in reprogrammed human fibroblasts confirms that a clone is an iPSC. Preferably, all of the markers are present.",
                        "Any art-known transfection vector may be employed, including, e.g., an RNA such as mRNA, microRNA, siRNA, antisense RNA and combinations thereof. Other expression vectors that may be employed include, e.g., a retrovirus, a lentivirus, an adenovirus, an adeno associated virus, a herpes virus, a Sindbis virus, a pox virus, a bacula virus, a bacterial phage, a Sendai virus and combinations thereof. Preferably, an employed vector is a non-replicative vector such as, e.g., Sendai virus vectors engineered to be nonreplicative. The preferred Sendai virus vector, while incapable of replication, remains capable of productive expression of nucleic acids encoding protein(s) carried by the vector, thereby preventing any potential uncontrolled spread to other cells or within the body of a vaccinee. This type of Sendai vector is commercially available as a CytoTune\u2122-iPS Sendai viral vector kit (DNAVEC, DV-0301).",
                        "Any art known transfection method may be employed to insert such vectors into the adult fibroblasts, including, e.g., electroporation, gene gun, and the like. Chemical transfection is optionally conducted by means of a transfecting agent e.g., a polymer, calcium phosphate, a cationic lipid, e.g., for lipofection, and the like. Cell penetrating peptides are also optionally employed to carry vectors or other agents into the adult fibroblast cells. In brief, cell penetrating peptides include those derived from proteins, e.g., protein transduction domains and/or amphipathic peptides, that can carry vectors or other agents into the cell include peptides. The subject of cell penetrating peptides has been reviewed, e.g., by Heitz et al., 2009 British Journal of Pharmacology, 157: 195-206, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Other cell penetrating peptides are art-known, and are disclosed by Heitz, Id. Other cell penetrating technologies including, e.g., liposomes and nanoparticles, are also contemplated to be employed in the methods of the present invention. Liposomes and nanoparticles are also described by Heitz, Id.",
                        "Antibodies are employed in order to tag the transformed cells for FACS sorting. Four antibodies against stem cell specific surface proteins are commonly used to identify and characterize human pluripotent stem cell populations; SSEA3, SSEA4, Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. The Stage Specific Embryonic Antigens 3 and 4 (SSEA3 and SSEA4) are two monoclonal antibodies which recognize sequential regions of a ganglioside present on human 2102Ep cells (Henderson et al., 2002 Stem Cells 20: 329-337; Kannagi et al., 1983, Embo J 2: 2355-2361). The Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81 antibodies were originally raised against human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells (PW et al., 1984, Hybridoma 3: 347-361) and have been shown to specifically recognize a carbohydrate epitope on a keratan sulfated glycoprotein identified as podocalyxin, a member of the CD34-related family of sialomucins (Badcock et al., 1999, Cancer Research 59: 4715-4719; Nielsen et al., 2007, PLoS ONE 2: e237; Schopperle and DeWolf, 2007, Stem Cells 25: 723-730). Several other surface markers have been shown to be expressed on ES cells and include CD326 or EpCam (Sundberg et al., 2009, Stem Cell Res 2: 113-124), CD24 (Heat Stable Antigen) and CD133 (Barraud et al., 2007, Journal of Neuroscience Research 85, 250-259) (Gang et al., 2007, Blood 109: 1743-1751). Chan et al., 2009, Id. reported that the identification of bona fide IPSc from fibroblasts undergoing reprogramming via four factor retro viral transduction can be achieved via live cell imaging and by the observation, over time, that fibroblasts lose expression of the cell surface markers CD13 and D7Fib, and gain expression of the pluripotent stem cell markers SSEA4 and Tra-1-60 (Chan et al., 2009, Id.).",

                                "To assess the ability of FACS to live sort reprogrammed fibroblasts a stable clone of the 1018 T1 D line was selected. This line had previously been established by manual picking and maintenance and FACS was used to enrich for the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60NEG and the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations in this line. Following 20 days of culture on MEFs the cultures were dissociated and surface marker expression was measured by flow cytometry (FC) (FIG. 1A). Adult fibroblasts expressing CD13POS and CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations were present in the wells containing sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60NEG cells, indicating that a proportion of Tra-1-60NEG cells were still undergoing reprogramming.",
                                "The presence of adult CD13POS fibroblasts may have been due to carryover in the form of doublets (target cells plus nontarget cells) resulting from incomplete dissociation. Alternatively, partially transformed cells may retain the ability to revert back to a fibroblast like state. As expected, the well containing sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations contained lower proportions of differentiated cells and very few adult fibroblasts expressing CD13POS.",
                                "These data demonstrate the ability of FACS to simultaneously deplete the adult fibroblasts from cultures and enrich reprogrammed cells.",
                                "To investigate the kinetics of fibroblast reprogramming using the retroviral vector, four factor system and determine the earliest time point post infection at which reprogrammed fibroblasts from could be successfully sorted from cultures of adult skin fibroblasts, the emergence of a population of cells negatively expressing the adult fibroblast marker CD13 and positively expressing the pluripotent surface markers SSEA4 and Tra-1-60 (CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS) was measured at 7 days intervals post infection (dpi) using flow cytometry. Previous time course expression analyses (Data Not Shown) carried out on foreskin fibroblasts for >30 dpi suggested that small number of SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS are present in cultures as early at dpi7, and increase in proportion by dpi21, but decrease at later time points as uninfected and transformed fibroblasts take over the culture.",
                                "The previous analyses was extended to include a foreskin (0825), a control (1023) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D) adult skin fibroblast line (1018), in order to investigate variability in reprogramming kinetics between tissue samples and healthy and disease types. As in previous experiments a similar trend was observed in the emergence of SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS cells in all cultures at dpi7, which increased in proportion with partially transformed cells, and decreased at later time points as uninfected and transformed fibroblasts took over the culture. (FIG. 1B). The double positive CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population continued to increase in the foreskin line but decreased in both adult fibroblast lines, although they contained less transformed cells.",
                                "Based on these observations it was hypothesized that a single cell suspension of the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population could be generated by FACS to provide a highly enriched starting point for the formation of unique clones of iPS colonies. To this end CD13NEGSSEA4POS and CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations were sorted from adult skin fibroblasts at dpi8 directly into MEF coated 6 well plates and monitored the formation of colonies. (FIG. 1C) Small but distinct colony formation was observed in both the CD13NEGSSEA4POS and CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS sorted populations as early as 3 days post sorting (dps) with the sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations producing more and larger colonies than the CD13NEGSSEA4POS populations. Following an additional two weeks of expansion without maintenance by manually removing differentiated cells, wells containing the CD13NEGSSEA4POS had become overgrown with differentiated cells but the sorted CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS wells contained large, well separated colonies with little differentiation occurring between them.",
                                "These data demonstrate that FACS can be used to enrich iPS cells which are viable, form colonies and contain very few transformed cells or adult fibroblasts.",
                                "To demonstrate the phenotypic and functional similarity between FACS and manually derived ips clones the fibroblast lines shown in FIG. 1B (0825, 1018, 1023) were reprogrammed in parallel wells under the retroviral protocol and standard derivation techniques or with FACS performed at dpi7.",
                                "Several colonies possessing \u201cgood\u201d qualities by eye were manually selected from each cell line and derivation technique and expanded prior to freezing. One clone from each line and technique was chosen for characterization. The karyotype of all derived clones matched the parent fibroblast line, displayed a normal karyotype and was free from of contamination with other cell lines. Table 5 and FIG. 2. Intriguingly, the parent 0825 fibroblast lines were found to be contaminated with an unknown cell lines most likely introduced into the tissue sample during time of tissue collection at the clinic. However, the cell lines derived by both techniques matched the parent fibroblast lines and were free of contamination with other cell lines.",
                                "All iPSC lines generated compact colonies with morphology consistent with normal human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines and were expanded for nine or greater passages prior to characterization. All lines expressed common markers of pluripotency by immunofluorescent microscopy, including the surface marker Tra-1-60 and the transcription factor Nanog (FIGS. 3A-B). Silencing of the virally transfected transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc and the endogenous gene expression of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 was confirmed by qPCR analysis (FIGS. 3C-D).",
                                "One advantage of using of FACS in derivation protocols is the capability of enriching rare reprogrammed cell populations from high passage fibroblast lines which show resistance to viral reprogramming techniques. A high passage fibroblast line was obtained from a commercial cell line repository, which failed to generate visually identifiable colonies after extended periods (>30 days) in culture.",
                                "Samples of these cultures were dissociated and underwent FACS and produced colonies which were then manually picked, expanded and characterized. FACS derived iPS colonies displayed the pluripotent surface marker SSEA4 and transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog (FIG. 4A). Silencing of the virally transfected transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc and the endogenous gene expression of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 was confirmed by qPCR analysis (FIGS. 4B-4C).",
                                "To demonstrate the ability of FACS to derive clonally unique iPS lines generated by retroviral reprogramming protocols genomic DNA was harvested from manually, and FACS derived, cell lines and Southern blot analysis was performed to detect the presence of multiple DNA integration sites for the KLF4 and Oct4 transcription factors. Clones A and T derived from the 1023 lines appear to be the same clone as both contain the same integration sites for KLF4 (data not shown). The D2 clone derived by FACS displayed a unique integration pattern for KLF4 indicating a single clone. Additional lines derived by manual and FACS retroviral reprogramming protocols were tested and confirmed the existence of unique patterns of integration suggesting that FACS can be used to produce monoclonal cell lines under the retroviral protocol (data not shown).",
                                "Several groups have reported the existence of subpopulations lineage precursors that are identified by unique combinations of surface markers (Pruszak et al., 2009, Stem Cells 27: 2928-2940; Sundberg et al., 2009 Stem Cell Res 2: 113-124). It was hypothesized that there may be unique combinations of surface markers that may identify more fully reprogrammed cells within the CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations. A previous analysis using the 1018 ipS line suggested that the SSEA4POSCD326POS gated population expressed moderate to high levels of CD117, CD146, and CD49f and little to none CD49d, CD73, CD144, CD184, and CD309. This analysis was extended with the BD Lyoplate\u2122 kit which consists of 242 purified antibodies to human Cluster of Differentiation (CD) surface markers. CD13NEGSSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations from FACS or manually derived cell lines were sorted into 96 well plates and allowed to recover prior to incubation with the primary antibodies and image acquisition.",
                                "Consistent expression was observed in approximately 15% of surface markers contained in the Lyoplate\u2122 kit, in at least 5 of the 9 lines tested, and variable expression of 4% of the surface markers in at least 3 of 9 lines tested. Based on these and the previous results of FC analysis it was determined to validate the expression of 48 surface markers on the SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS populations by flow cytometry using the 0819 foreskin line. All cells withing the SSEA4POSTra-1-60POS population expressed Alkaline Phosphatase, CD133, and CD326. To further define the reprogrammed population the characterization panel was adjusted to include CD236 and expression levels of 49 cell membrane surface markers on the SSEA4POSTra-1-60POSCD326POS population were evaluated.",
