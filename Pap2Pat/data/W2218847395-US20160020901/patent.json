                        "Sponge functions may be used in cryptographic applications. In this regard, the sponge functions can be used to implement symmetric cryptography functionalities (e.g., key derivation, message encryption, and authentication code computation). A detailed discussion of sponge functions is provided in a document entitled \u201cCryptographic Sponge Functions\u201d, which was written by Bertoni et al. and published on Jan. 14, 2011 (\u201cBertoni\u201d). As stated in Bertoni, a sponge function instantiates a sponge construction. The sponge construction is a simple iterated construction for building a function F based on a fixed length permutation. The function F has a variable-length input and an arbitrary output length. The fixed length permutation operates on a state of b=r+c bits, where r is the bitrate and c is the capacity. The capacity c determines the security level of the sponge construction.",
                        "During operation, each of the bits b is initialized to zero and an input message is cut into blocks of r bits. Thereafter, absorbing operations are performed in which: the r bits of each block are respectively XORed with the first r initialized bits; and a first permutation operation is performed using the results of the XOR operation as inputs. Next, squeezing operations are performed in which a second permutation operation is performed using the output bits of the first permutation operation as input bits. The output of the second permutation operation may then be truncated to the first l bits.",
                        "Duplex constructions are closely related to the sponge construction. Duplex constructions comprise a plurality of duplexing stages. During a first duplexing stage, all bits of the state are set to zero and a first input string \u03c40 is padded. The first input string \u03c40 is then XORed with the first r initialized bits. Then, a permutation function is applied to the results of the XOR operations so as to generate a set of first output bits. The first output bits are then truncated to the first l bits. In a next duplexing stage, a second input string \u03c41 is padded. The second input string \u03c41 is then XORed with the first output bits of the first duplexing stage. The permutation function is applied to the results of the XOR operations so as to generate a set of second output bits. The second output bits are then truncated to the first l bits."

The sponge construction 100 is a simple iterated construction for building a function F based on a unique permutation function \u0192. The function F has a variable-length input and an arbitrary output length. The unique permutation function \u0192 operates on a state of b=r+c bits, where r (e.g., 128 bits) is the bitrate and c (e.g., 384 bits) is the capacity. The capacity c determines the security level of the sponge construction.",

Such absorption is achieved by combining K (or K\u2225N) with the first r bits of the initialized state bits b. In some scenarios, the bits b (e.g., 512 bits) are initialized to zero. The present invention is not limited in this regard. The bits b (e.g., 512 bits) may alternatively be initialized to any bit value (e.g., any 512 bit value).

XOR operations are well known in the art, and therefore will not be described in detail here. Still, it should be understood that the XOR operations are performed on a bit-by-bit basis. The result of each XOR operation is true whenever an odd number of inputs are true and false whenever an even number of inputs are true.

Notably, permutation functional block 102 takes the output of the absorbing phase 120 as an input. Permutation functional block 104 takes the output of permutation functional block 102 as an input.
