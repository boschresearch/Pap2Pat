                        "The day-night cycle is a major environmental cue that controls daily and seasonal rhythms in plants. Diurnal light-dark transitions entrain the internal circadian clock that generates rhythms that are self-sustained (free-running) under constant light conditions. A simplified model of the clock is comprised by three basic components: an input pathway that senses light; a core oscillator that is the transcriptional machinery generating rhythms; and output pathways that control various developmental and metabolic processes, resulting in the appropriate physiological adaptations to the day-night cycle (Barak, et al., (2000) Trends Plant Sci 5:517-522; Harmer, (2009) Annu Rev Plant Biol 60:357-377). The proper synchronization of the internal clock and external light/dark cycles result in better plant fitness, survival, competitive advantage (Dodd, et al., (2005) Science 309:630-633) and growth vigor (Ni, et al., (2009) Nature 457:327-331).",
                        "The genetic architecture of the plant circadian system has thus far been mostly elucidated in Arabidopsis (Mas, (2008) Trends Cell Biol 18:273-281). The input pathways are comprised of two sets of photoreceptors, the red/far-red sensing phytochromes (PHYA-E) and the UV-A/blue-light sensing cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2), which percept light during the day and send signals to the core oscillator (Nemhauser, (2008) Curr Opin Plant Biol 11:4-8). The core oscillator genes form interlocking transcriptional feedback loops (Harmer and McClung, (2009) Science 323:1440-1441). The morning loop, consists of the MYB-like transcription factors CCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED) and LHY (LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), which participate in regulation of two different loops. In the morning loop, CCA1/LHY negatively regulate transcription of the pseudo-response regulator TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) and the TCP-like transcription factor CHE (CCA1 HIKING EXPEDITION). TOC1/CHE form a complex that positively regulates transcription of CCA1/LHY (Pruneda-Paz, et al., (2009) Science 323:1481-1485). In the day loop, CCA1/LHY positively regulates transcription of the PRR7 and PRR9 (PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORS) both of which negatively regulate CCA1/LHY. In the evening loop, TOC1/CHE works as a negative regulator of GI (GIGANTIA), itself a positive regulator of TOC1. The evening gene ZTL (ZEITLUPE, a protein-degrading F-box protein), involved in degradation of TOC1 and PRR3 proteins, provides regulation of the core clock components at the protein level (Mas, et al., (2003) Nature 426:567-570). The multiple interlocking transcription loops maintain a robust yet flexible genetic machinery (Harmer (2009))",
                        "The circadian clock generates rhythmic outputs that regulate many plant developmental and physiological processes including: growth (Nozue, et al., (2007) Nature 448:358-361; Nozue and Maloof, (2006) Plant Cell Environ 29:396-408), flowering time, tuberization in annuals, growth cessation and bud set in perennials (Lagercrantz, (2009) J Exp Bot 60:2501-2515), photosynthesis (Sun, et al., (2003) Plant Mol Biol 53:467-478), nitrogen uptake (Gutierrez, et al., (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:4939-4944) and hormone signaling and stress response (Covington and Harmer, (2007) PLoS Biol 5:e222). However, knowledge of the molecular nodes that link the circadian clock with output pathways are just now emerging. So far the best understood connection is the photoperiod regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis and rice. The Arabidopsis clock gene GI and its rice homologue OsGI promotes expression of the transcription factors CO (CONSTANS) and OsCO (Hd1, HEADING1), which control transcription of the downstream floral activator FT (FLOWERING LOCUS T) in Arabidopsis and its homologous gene Hd3a (HEADING 3a) in rice (Michaels, (2009) Curr Opin Plant Biol 12:75-80, Tsuji and Komiya, (2008) Rice 1:25-35). The photoperiod sensitive pathways ensure flowering under favorable conditions.",
                        "Several publications identified molecular connections between the Arabidopsis core oscillators and a broad range of plant physiological processes. Rhythmic hypocotyl growth is promoted by positive action of two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5 (PHYTOCHROM-INERACTING FACTOR) whose transcript levels are regulated by CCA1 (Nozue, et al., (2007) Nature 448:358-361). The hypocotyl growth is also independently regulated by free levels of the phytohormone auxin, produced by the auxin biosynthetic gene YUCCAS, that is controlled directly by the clock-dependent Myb-like transcription factor RVE1 (REVEILLE 1) (Rawat, et al., (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:16883-16888). This is a direct link between circadian oscillators and the auxin networks that coordinate seedling growth in Arabidopsis. Output pathways of PPR9/7/5 genes are related to maintenance of the central metabolism, mainly in mitochondria, and in particular the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fukushima, et al., (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:7251-7256). TOC1 is also linked with the stress-related ABA hormone connecting the circadian clocks with plant responses to drought (Legnaioli, et al., (2009) The EMBO Journal 28:3745-3757).",
                        "The use of microarray technology has uncovered the pervasive influence of circadian rhythms on gene transcription in Arabidopsis. These studies have mainly focused on light-sensing tissues, such as Arabidopsis rosettes. Up to 35% of Arabidopsis genes are circadian-regulated in green tissues (Covington, et al., (2008) Genome Biol 9:R130; Harmer, et al., (2000) Science 290:2110-2113; Ptitsyn, (2008) BMC Bioinformatics 9(9):S18). While animal models have shown that nearly every tissue has a large circadian component to its transcriptional program, diverse plant tissues have not yet been systematically evaluated as to the relative contribution of diurnal light cycles on transcription (Ptitsyn, et al., (2006) PLoS Comput Biol 2:e16). In the pre-genomic era diurnal changes were observed in maize leaf photosynthesis and leaf elongation rates, which were the greatest at midday (Kalt-Torres and Huber, (1987) Plant Physiol 83:294-298, Kalt-Torres, et al., (1987) Plant Physiol 83:283-288, Usuda, et al., (1987) Plant Physiol 83:289-293). Diurnal oscillation of the endosperm-specific transcription factor O2 (Opaque 2) was also found in non-photosynthetic kernels, and it was proposed that O2 activity is controlled by diurnal metabolite flux (Ciceri, et al., (1999) Plant Physiol 121:1321-1328). Diurnal and circadian rhythms were demonstrated for maize homologues of GI (gigz1) and CO (conz1), which are direct outputs of the circadian clock in the photoperiod pathway controlling Arabidopsis flowering time (Miller, et al., (2008) Planta 227:1377-1388), even though temperate maize is a day-neutral plant whose flowering is not regulated by the day length.",
                        "This study identified two TOC1 homologues, ZmTOCa and ZmTOCb, which mapped to chromosome 5 and 4, respectively. Transcription of both genes peaks at 6 \u03bcm, consistent with Arabidopsis TOC1 gene expression. TOC1 is a member of the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) family composed of evolutionarily conserved five PRR genes in Arabidopsis and rice (Murakami, et al., (2007) Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 71:1107-1110; Murakami, et al., (2003) Plant Cell Physiol 44:1229-1236). In addition to two ZmTOC1 homologues, the study also identified ZmPRR73, ZmPRR37 and ZmPRR59 that were named after rice PRR genes based on the level of sequence similarly (Murakami, et al., (2003)). Also identified were two ZEITLUPE homologues (Kim, et al., (2007) Nature 449:356-360), ZmZTLa and ZmZTLb, which mapped to chromosome 2 and 4. Two maize orthologs of GIGANTIA, gigz1A and gigz1B, were described previously (Miller, et al., (2008) Planta 227:1377-1388) and are here confirmed their oscillation in both ears and leaves. The majority of the known core components cycle in both Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis, 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, Del. 19808-1610, USA) and Illumina (Illumina, Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, Calif. 92121 USA), analyses. Cycling of the core components ZmCCA, ZmLHY, ZmTOC1a and ZmTOC1b were further confirmed via RT-PCR analysis. The amplitudes of the core components is attenuated in the developing ear when compared with leaf tissue, but still robust. These data show that the majority of the plant core oscillator system is functioning in non-photosynthetic tissues such as ear, but the oscillator output is apparently largely isolated from the transcriptional machinery affecting downstream diurnal expression changes.",
                        "Components of the core clock mechanism and proximal signaling mechanism emanating from it, could be modified in such manner as to positively affect crop performance, as by for example shifting or extending the relationship between sources and sinks such as leaves and ears. Wholesale genetic complementation of diurnal patterns from different germplasm sources has been shown to augment the combined diurnal patterns and apparent fitness (Ni, (2009))."

                        "No systematic study of diurnal/circadian transcriptional patterns in maize has yet been undertaken. The present study was initiated to examine the extent that the diurnal cycle plays in regulating gene transcription in maize using modern genome-wide profiling technologies. Field experiments were designed under natural undisturbed conditions and sampled both a photosynthetic tissue, leaf and a non-photosynthetic tissue, developing ear. Thousands of transcripts that markedly cycle in the maize leaves were identified. In non-photosynthetic ears however just a small set of genes, as little as 45, were clearly diurnally cycling. Many of these are maize homologues of Arabidopsis core oscillator genes, indicating that core circadian genes are conserved in maize and diurnally expressed in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues.",
                        "A number of maize diurnally regulated genes were identified during the analyses. A total of 471 sequences, including those from immature ear, those having high amplitude/magnitude cycling in leaf tissue, and diverse sequences associated with NUE and Carbon::Nitrogen functions.

                        "The term \u201cconservatively modified variants\u201d applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refer to those nucleic acids that encode identical or conservatively modified variants of the amino acid sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations\u201d and represent one species of conservatively modified variation. Every nucleic acid sequence herein that encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of ordinary skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine; one exception is Micrococcus rubens, for which GTG is the methionine codon (Ishizuka, et al., (1993) J. Gen. Microbiol. 139:425-32) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid, which encodes a polypeptide of the present disclosure, is implicit in each described polypeptide sequence and incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \u201cconservatively modified variant\u201d when the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Thus, any number of amino acid residues selected from the group of integers consisting of from 1 to 15 can be so altered. Thus, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 or 10 alterations can be made. Conservatively modified variants typically provide similar biological activity as the unmodified polypeptide sequence from which they are derived. For example, substrate specificity, enzyme activity, or ligand/receptor binding is generally at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90%, preferably 60-90% of the native protein for it's native substrate.

A nucleic acid encoding a protein may comprise non-translated sequences (e.g., introns) within translated regions of the nucleic acid, or may lack such intervening non-translated sequences (e.g., as in cDNA). The information by which a protein is encoded is specified by the use of codons. Typically, the amino acid sequence is encoded by the nucleic acid using the \u201cuniversal\u201d genetic code.

Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing conditions, target sequences can be identified which can be up to 100% complementary to the probe (homologous probing). Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in sequences so that lower degrees of similarity are detected (heterologous probing). Optimally, the probe is approximately 500 nucleotides in length, but can vary greatly in length from less than 500 nucleotides to equal to the entire length of the target sequence.",
                        "Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30\u00b0 C. for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60\u00b0 C. for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide or Denhardt's. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) at 37\u00b0 C. and a wash in 1\u00d7 to 2\u00d7SSC (20\u00d7SSC=3.0 M NaCl/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55\u00b0 C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions include hybridization in 40 to 45% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C. and a wash in 0.5\u00d7 to 1\u00d7SSC at 55 to 60\u00b0 C. Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C. and a wash in 0.1\u00d7SSC at 60 to 65\u00b0 C. Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl, (1984) Anal. Biochem. 138:267-84: Tm=81.5\u00b0 C.+16.6 (log M)+0.41 (% GC)\u22120.61 (% form)\u2212500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, % GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Tm is reduced by about 1\u00b0 C. for each 1% of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with \u226790% identity are sought, the Tm can be decreased 10\u00b0 C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3 or 4\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm); moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm); low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 20\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm). Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired Tm, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a Tm of less than 45\u00b0 C. (aqueous solution) or 32\u00b0 C. (formamide solution) it is preferred to increase the SSC concentration so that a higher temperature can be used.

                        "GAP uses the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, supra, to find the alignment of two complete sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. GAP considers all possible alignments and gap positions and creates the alignment with the largest number of matched bases and the fewest gaps. It allows for the provision of a gap creation penalty and a gap extension penalty in units of matched bases. GAP must make a profit of gap creation penalty number of matches for each gap it inserts. If a gap extension penalty greater than zero is chosen, GAP must, in addition, make a profit for each gap inserted of the length of the gap times the gap extension penalty. Default gap creation penalty values and gap extension penalty values in Version 10 of the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package\u00ae are 8 and 2, respectively. The gap creation and gap extension penalties can be expressed as an integer selected from the group of integers consisting of from 0 to 100. Thus, for example, the gap creation and gap extension penalties can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 or greater.",

GAP displays four figures of merit for alignments: Quality, Ratio, Identity and Similarity. The Quality is the metric maximized in order to align the sequences. Ratio is the quality divided by the number of bases in the shorter segment. Percent Identity is the percent of the symbols that actually match. Percent Similarity is the percent of the symbols that are similar. Symbols that are across from gaps are ignored. A similarity is scored when the scoring matrix value for a pair of symbols is greater than or equal to 0.50, the similarity threshold. The scoring matrix used in Version 10 of the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package\u00ae is BLOSUM62 (see, Henikoff and Henikoff, (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915).",

However, many real proteins comprise regions of nonrandom sequences, which may be homopolymeric tracts, short-period repeats, or regions enriched in one or more amino acids. Such low-complexity regions may be aligned between unrelated proteins even though other regions of the protein are entirely dissimilar. A number of low-complexity filter programs can be employed to reduce such low-complexity alignments. For example, the SEG (Wooten and Federhen, (1993) Comput. Chem. 17:149-63) and XNU (Claverie and States, (1993) Comput. Chem. 17:191-201) low-complexity filters can be employed alone or in combination.",
                        "As used herein, \u201csequence identity\u201d or \u201cidentity\u201d in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences includes reference to the residues in the two sequences, which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences, which differ by such conservative substitutions, are said to have \u201csequence similarity\u201d or \u201csimilarity.\u201d Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., according to the algorithm of Meyers and Miller, (1988) Computer Applic. Biol. Sci. 4:11-17, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif., USA).",

The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.",
                        "The term \u201csubstantial identity\u201d of polynucleotide sequences means that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has between 50-100% sequence identity, preferably at least 50% sequence identity, preferably at least 60% sequence identity, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%, compared to a reference sequence using one of the alignment programs described using standard parameters. One of skill will recognize that these values can be appropriately adjusted to determine corresponding identity of proteins encoded by two nucleotide sequences by taking into account codon degeneracy, amino acid similarity, reading frame positioning and the like. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences for these purposes normally means sequence identity of between 55-100%, preferably at least 55%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90% and most preferably at least 95%.",
                        "Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. The degeneracy of the genetic code allows for many amino acids substitutions that lead to variety in the nucleotide sequence that code for the same amino acid, hence it is possible that the DNA sequence could code for the same polypeptide but not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. This may occur, e.g., when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. One indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is that the polypeptide, which the first nucleic acid encodes, is immunologically cross reactive with the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid.",

Preferably, optimal alignment is conducted using the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, supra. An indication that two peptide sequences are substantially identical is that one peptide is immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against the second peptide. Thus, a peptide is substantially identical to a second peptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by a conservative substitution. In addition, a peptide can be substantially identical to a second peptide when they differ by a non-conservative change if the epitope that the antibody recognizes is substantially identical. Peptides, which are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d share sequences as, noted above except that residue positions, which are not identical, may differ by conservative amino acid changes.",

                        "Maize orthologs of the Arabidopsis and rice circadian genes were identified by reciprocal BLAST searches plus evaluation of whether the inferred proteins relationships abide by the speciation pattern, and then queried for oscillation patterns in leaf and ear tissues. Employing these criteria, maize homologues were identified for several major core components including CCA1/LHY, TOC1, PRR7/3, GI and ZTL (FIG. 1).",
                        "This study identified two TOC1 homologues, ZmTOCa and ZmTOCb, which mapped to chromosome 5 and 4, respectively. Transcription of both genes peaks at 6 \u03bcm, consistent with Arabidopsis TOC1 gene expression. TOC1 is a member of the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) family composed of evolutionarily conserved five PRR genes in Arabidopsis and rice (Murakami, et al., (2007) Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 71:1107-1110; Murakami, et al., (2003) Plant Cell Physiol 44:1229-1236). In addition to two ZmTOC1 homologues, the study also identified ZmPRR73, ZmPRR37 and ZmPRR59 that were named after rice PRR genes based on the level of sequence similarly (Murakami, et al., (2003)). Also identified were two ZEITLUPE homologues (Kim, et al., (2007) Nature 449:356-360), ZmZTLa and ZmZTLb, which mapped to chromosome 2 and 4. Two maize orthologs of GIGANTIA, gigz1A and gigz1B, were described previously (Miller, et al., (2008) Planta 227:1377-1388) and are here confirmed their oscillation in both ears and leaves. Cycling of the core components ZmCCA, ZmLHY, ZmTOC1a and ZmTOC1b were further confirmed via RT-PCR analysis (FIG. 2). The amplitudes of the core components is attenuated in the developing ear when compared with leaf tissue, but still robust. These data show that the majority of the plant core oscillator system is functioning in non-photosynthetic tissues such as ear, but the oscillator output is apparently largely isolated from the transcriptional machinery affecting downstream diurnal expression changes.",
                        "It was determined that diurnally regulated transcripts pervade most functions of the maize leaf cells. The 6674 transcripts (out of 10,037 Agilent array probes) that are here determined to be diurnally regulated represent over 22% of the total detected transcripts expressed and these 6674 transcripts could be assigned to 1716 different Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 22 KOGs functional categories.",
                        "Generally, individual genes peak have just one peak in their diurnal cycle. When these genes were assigned to functional terms and the relative enrichment of those functional terms was plotted across the span of the day, most functions had a marked enrichment for a time particular pattern in the day. There was also however a clear tendency for some functional terms to have a bimodal pattern, wherein there was a mid-morning peak at 10 AM and a secondary peak in the late afternoon or evening at 6 PM or 10 PM. Over 18% of the functional terms were classified as bimodal regulated, with further subdivisions made according to relative enrichment of the morning or afternoon peak. Together with the functions assigned as peaking at just one peak in the day, 94.5% of the 1738 functions were assigned to one of these patterns, with just 95 leftover to be assigned to the \u201cOther\u201d patterns.",
                        "Often the bimodal patterned functional terms represent broader gene-rich functional classifications such as protein kinase activity, signal transduction mechanism, or amino acid transport and metabolism. (FIG. 5) Accordingly, these bimodal patterns tend to also have fair representation across the day and not just at 10 AM and 6/10 PM. Nonetheless, it remains a chief feature of the diurnal pattern that gene and functional enrichment peaks typically occur in the mid-morning and again later in the afternoon/evening. In this experiment the sunrise was 6:02 AM and the sunset at 8:40 PM. The sunrise is thus 4 hours before the 10 AM functional peak, but the sunset is 2.45 hours after the 6 PM timepoint and 1.25 hours before the 10 PM timepoint. Additional timepoints may provide greater resolution, but that among the bimodal patterns the 10 AM>6/10 PM patterns have over 70% higher functional enrichment indexes than the 6 PM>10 AM patterns may relate to this asymmetrical placement of the timepoints relative to the sunrise and sunset. Alternatively, some functional classes may be inherently enriched for the morning phase, reflecting underlying biological tendencies.",
                        "That 1643 or 94.5% of the functional terms were assigned to one temporal peak pattern indicates a fairly defined progression of functions across the day. Functional groups are thus not uniformly spread across the different phases of the day, but instead exhibit distinct patterns and biases. The dawn enriched functional categories include for example: response to cold, lipid catabolism and hormone signaling. This follows by mid-morning with multiple hormone response functions becoming enriched. The mid-day becomes dominated expectedly by photosynthesis systems I and II, chlorophyll synthesis, and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR) involved in antioxidant generation. Late afternoon and evening reveal a marked enrichment for ribosomal and DNA damage repair, including helicase, telomerase and endonuclease activity, suggesting chromosomal and ribosomal repair systems are activated. In addition sucrose transport and the pentose-phosphate shunt peak in late afternoon/evening suggesting dynamics of chloroplast carbohydrate metabolism. Late evening peaks include the red::far-red light phototransduction, noted in the introduction as regulating the core clock, but also hydrogen peroxide metabolism. At night caspase(-like) activity, often associated with cell death, photosystem II catabolism, nucleotide transport and metabolism and acyl-CoA binding functions all peak. Other irregular but interesting peak patterns are amino acid glycosylation cresting at both 6 PM and 2 AM, and both malic enzyme and calmodulin binding peaking at 10 AM and 2 AM. These are just a few examples of a very complex story addressing the whole plant cellular physiology.",
                        "Notably, despite the great variety of genes and functions being diurnally regulated, most functional categories have only a minority of members that are diurnally regulated. Among the 1738 functional categories, the mean coverage was 28.2% with the median 20% and mode about 15%. Functional categories containing multiple genes were not completely represented by diurnally regulated transcripts, and few functional categories were outstandingly enriched for diurnally regulated transcripts. GO:0004614 phosphoglucomutase activity had five of six and GO:0009926 auxin polar transport had three of four, transcripts among the diurnal set. These findings indicate that diurnally regulated transcripts are within but do not dominate these diverse functions.",

In some embodiments, the selected characteristic will be an altered Km and/or Kcat over the wild-type protein as provided herein. In other embodiments, a protein or polynucleotide generated from sequence shuffling will have a ligand binding affinity greater than the non-shuffled wild-type polynucleotide. In yet other embodiments, a protein or polynucleotide generated from sequence shuffling will have an altered pH optimum as compared to the non-shuffled wild-type polynucleotide. The increase in such properties can be at least 110%, 120%, 130%, 140% or greater than 150% of the wild-type value."

An example of a splicing sequence is the VP1 intron from SV40 (Sprague, et al., (1983) J. Virol. 45:773-81). Additionally, gene sequences to control replication in the host cell may be incorporated into the vector such as those found in bovine papilloma virus type-vectors (Saveria-Campo, \u201cBovine Papilloma Virus DNA a Eukaryotic Cloning Vector,\u201d in DNA CLONING: A PRACTICAL APPROACH, vol.

A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes are plant pathogenic soil bacteria, which genetically transform plant cells. The Ti and Ri plasmids of A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes, respectively, carry genes responsible for genetic transformation of plants. See, e.g., Kado, (1991) Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 10:1. Descriptions of the Agrobacterium vector systems and methods for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer are provided in Gruber, et al., supra; Miki, et al., supra and Moloney, et al., (1989) Plant Cell Reports 8:238.",
                                "Similarly, the gene can be inserted into the T-DNA region of a Ti or Ri plasmid derived from A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes, respectively. Thus, expression cassettes can be constructed as above, using these plasmids. Many control sequences are known which when coupled to a heterologous coding sequence and transformed into a host organism show fidelity in gene expression with respect to tissue/organ specificity of the original coding sequence. See, e.g., Benfey and Chua, (1989) Science 244:174-81. Particularly suitable control sequences for use in these plasmids are promoters for constitutive leaf-specific expression of the gene in the various target plants. Other useful control sequences include a promoter and terminator from the nopaline synthase gene (NOS). The NOS promoter and terminator are present in the plasmid pARC2, available from the American Type Culture Collection and designated ATCC 67238. If such a system is used, the virulence (vir) gene from either the Ti or Ri plasmid must also be present, either along with the T-DNA portion or via a binary system where the vir gene is present on a separate vector. Such systems, vectors for use therein, and methods of transforming plant cells are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,658,082; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 913,914, filed Oct. 1, 1986, as referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,306, issued Nov. 16, 1993 and Simpson, et al., (1986) Plant Mol. Biol. 6:403-15 (also referenced in the '306 patent), all incorporated by reference in their entirety.",
                                "Once constructed, these plasmids can be placed into A. rhizogenes or A. tumefaciens and these vectors used to transform cells of plant species, which are ordinarily susceptible to Fusarium or Alternaria infection. Several other transgenic plants are also contemplated by the present disclosure including but not limited to soybean, corn, sorghum, alfalfa, rice, clover, cabbage, banana, coffee, celery, tobacco, cowpea, cotton, melon and pepper. The selection of either A. tumefaciens or A. rhizogenes will depend on the plant being transformed thereby. In general A. tumefaciens is the preferred organism for transformation. Most dicotyledonous plants, some gymnosperms and a few monocotyledonous plants (e.g., certain members of the Liliales and Arales) are susceptible to infection with A. tumefaciens. A. rhizogenes also has a wide host range, embracing most dicots and some gymnosperms, which includes members of the Leguminosae, Compositae and Chenopodiaceae. Monocot plants can now be transformed with some success. EP Patent Application Number 604 662 A1 discloses a method for transforming monocots using Agrobacterium. EP Patent Application Number 672 752 A1 discloses a method for transforming monocots with Agrobacterium using the scutellum of immature embryos. Ishida, et al., discuss a method for transforming maize by exposing immature embryos to A. tumefaciens (Nature Biotechnology 14:745-50 (1996)).",
                                "Once transformed, these cells can be used to regenerate transgenic plants. For example, whole plants can be infected with these vectors by wounding the plant and then introducing the vector into the wound site. Any part of the plant can be wounded, including leaves, stems and roots. Alternatively, plant tissue, in the form of an explant, such as cotyledonary tissue or leaf disks, can be inoculated with these vectors and cultured under conditions, which promote plant regeneration. Roots or shoots transformed by inoculation of plant tissue with A. rhizogenes or A. tumefaciens, containing the gene coding for the fumonisin degradation enzyme, can be used as a source of plant tissue to regenerate fumonisin-resistant transgenic plants, either via somatic embryogenesis or organogenesis. Examples of such methods for regenerating plant tissue are disclosed in Shahin, Theor. Appl. Genet. 69:235-40 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 4,658,082; Simpson, et al., supra and U.S. patent application Ser.

Several methods of plant transformation, collectively referred to as direct gene transfer, have been developed as an alternative to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.",
                                "A generally applicable method of plant transformation is microprojectile-mediated transformation, where DNA is carried on the surface of microprojectiles measuring about 1 to 4 \u03bcm. The expression vector is introduced into plant tissues with a biolistic device that accelerates the microprojectiles to speeds of 300 to 600 m/s which is sufficient to penetrate the plant cell walls and membranes (Sanford, et al., (1987) Part. Sci. Technol. 5:27; Sanford, (1988) Trends Biotech 6:299; Sanford, (1990) Physiol. Plant 79:206 and Klein, et al., (1992) Biotechnology 10:268).",

For antisense suppression, the expression cassette is designed to express an RNA molecule complementary to all or part of a messenger RNA encoding the diurnal polypeptide. Over expression of the antisense RNA molecule can result in reduced expression of the native gene.

In addition, the antisense polynucleotide may be fully complementary (i.e., 100% identical to the complement of the target sequence) or partially complementary (i.e., less than 100% identical to the complement of the target sequence) to the target sequence. Antisense suppression may be used to inhibit the expression of multiple proteins in the same plant. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,657. Furthermore, portions of the antisense nucleotides may be used to disrupt the expression of the target gene. Generally, sequences of at least 50 nucleotides, 100 nucleotides, 200 nucleotides, 300, 400, 450, 500, 550 or greater may be used.

For dsRNA interference, a sense RNA molecule like that described above for cosuppression and an antisense RNA molecule that is fully or partially complementary to the sense RNA molecule are expressed in the same cell, resulting in inhibition of the expression of the corresponding endogenous messenger RNA.",

These methods are highly efficient at inhibiting the expression of endogenous genes. See, Waterhouse and Helliwell, (2003) Nat. Rev. Genet. 4:29-38 and the references cited therein.",

The base-paired stem region comprises a sense sequence corresponding to all or part of the endogenous messenger RNA encoding the gene whose expression is to be inhibited and an antisense sequence that is fully or partially complementary to the sense sequence. Thus, the base-paired stem region of the molecule generally determines the specificity of the RNA interference. hpRNA molecules are highly efficient at inhibiting the expression of endogenous genes, and the RNA interference they induce is inherited by subsequent generations of plants. See, for example, Chuang and Meyerowitz, (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:4985-4990; Stoutjesdijk, et al., (2002) Plant Physiol. 129:1723-1731 and Waterhouse and Helliwell, (2003) Nat. Rev.

                                "For ihpRNA, the interfering molecules have the same general structure as for hpRNA, but the RNA molecule additionally comprises an intron that is capable of being spliced in the cell in which the ihpRNA is expressed. The use of an intron minimizes the size of the loop in the hairpin RNA molecule following splicing, and this increases the efficiency of interference. See, for example, Smith, et al., (2000) Nature 407:319-320. In fact, Smith, et al., shows 100% suppression of endogenous gene expression using ihpRNA-mediated interference. Methods for using ihpRNA interference to inhibit the expression of endogenous plant genes are described, for example, in Smith, et al., (2000) Nature 407:319-320; Wesley, et al., (2001) Plant J. 27:581-590; Wang and Waterhouse, (2001) Curr.

In this embodiment, the sense and antisense sequence flank a loop sequence that comprises a nucleotide sequence corresponding to all or part of the endogenous messenger RNA of the target gene. Thus, it is the loop region that determines the specificity of the RNA interference. See, for example, WO 02/00904, herein incorporated by reference.",

Light conditions at sampling were approximately 14.75 hours of sunlight according to records of US Naval Observatory (Materials and Methods). Starting at sunrise on day 1, the top leaves and immature ears were sampled at 4 hour time intervals over three consecutive days. RNA profiling was performed on custom Agilent Maize arrays designed to interrogate global gene expression patterns across circa 105K probes. Samples for the Illumina Digital Gene Expression (DGE) platform were collected with 3 replicate pools of 3 plants every 4 hours over a 1 day period. The three samples were then split into three groups for analysis.",
                                "The GeneTS methodology was applied to the data to determine periodicity (Wichert, et al., (2004) Bioinformatics 20:5-20). This method first creates a periodogram for Fourier frequencies. Significant Fourier frequencies are then assessed for significance via Fisher's g-statistic. Given the experimental design, this method shows greater power in the detection of circadian rhythmicity than other commonly used methods (Hughes, et al., (2007) Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol 72:381-386; Hughes, et al., (2009) PLoS Genet. 5:e1000442). The significance values from Fisher's G-Test were then corrected for multiple measures comparisons via conversion to q-values to assess False Discovery Rates (Storey and Tibshirani, (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:9440-9445). Diurnally regulated transcripts were determined as those having significant expression at least once per day and also that were significant at a FDR rate of 10%.",

                                "Diurnal rhythms of gene expression were readily detectable within the photosynthetic leaf tissue. Of the 44,187 probes with detectable expression, 10,037 or 22.7% were identified as cycling by the GeneTS algorithm. This proportion of cycling transcripts is in line with the proportion reported for Arabidopsis (Hazen, et al., (2009) Genome Biol 10:R17). Significantly cycling transcripts have a median period of 24.1 hours, as would be expected for natural conditions. Amplitudes of cycling transcripts are robust, with a median peak/trough ratio-5-fold, with many showing peak/trough ratios of higher than 20-fold. The peak expression for these cycling transcripts exhibits a broad distribution, peaking at all phases of the day.",

                                "In contrast to the leaf results, very few transcripts within the developing ear exhibited diurnal rhythms. Only 149 of the 38,445 expressed transcript probes (1.7%) were positively identified as cycling. Despite the low numbers of cycling transcripts, there is early-evening enrichment, with roughly half of the cycling transcripts peaking in this phase. Of the 149 transcripts, 100 (67.1%) were also diurnally cycling in the leaf tissue. Among those that cycled in both leaf and ear tissues, the amplitudes of the rhythms is severely attenuated in the developing ear. This list was reduced to 45 putative ear cycling genes after consolidation of redundant probes and more thorough gene annotation (FIG. 3). Many of these genes appeared to be maize homologues of well-described Arabidopsis oscillators CCA1/LHY, TOC1, PRR7/3, GI, ZTL (ZEITLUPE, known as Adagio-like protein 3 in rice). The maize ear tissue core oscillator thus appears to be intact, but is apparently decoupled from the majority of its transcriptional output systems.",
                                "A few output genes are nonetheless found in the set of genes that cycle in ears. The list of robust cycling transcripts include up to 13 maize light-harvesting CAB transcripts (chlorophyll a-b binding protein), which is a subset of the greater maize CAB gene family. The CONSTANS-like (ZmCO-like) gene, mapped to chromosome 1, cycles in ears and leaves with a peak of expression at early evening (6 PM). However it is a different CO homologue that have been previously identified as conz1 on chromosome 9 (Miller, et al., (2008) Planta 227:1377-1388). Robust cycling was detected for the MYB-like transcription factor (ZmMyb.L) which peaked at dawn (6 AM). This gene is a homologue of REVEILLE1, a Myb-transcription factor integrating the circadian clock and auxin pathway in Arabidopsis (Rawat, et al., (2009)). Two ear-specific genes have intriguing putative functions, a zinc finger protein (ZmZF-5) peaking at 10 AM and an osmotic stress/abscisic acid-activated serine/threonine-protein kinase (ZmSAPK9) peaking at 6 PM. Among other cycling genes there are three encoding transporters, two heat shock proteins, several enzymes and hypothetical proteins.",

This represents the first NexGen-style deep sequencing effort for determining rhythmic diurnal expression patterns. Three replicates from each of six time points (ZT0, ZT4, ZT8, ZT12, ZT16 and ZT20) were sequenced off anchor points for two restriction enzyme cut sites, DPNII and NLAIII. Each multiplexed sample was run in separate flow cell lanes. Output sequences were assessed for quality and aligned against the Dana Farber Gene Index Maize 19.0 (found on world wide web at compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/). A total of 4.7\u00d7109 base pairs passed all quality control and alignment measures from the sequencing runs, which is approximately 1.3\u00d7108 bp per lane. Over 1.89\u00d7108 tags were advanced for gene expression analysis of rhythmic behavior, or roughly 5.25 million tags per sample. The three replicates were artificially split into three consecutive days. The data was then assessed for periodicity in the same manner as the microarray data. This data is chiefly used here as independent confirmation for those cycling transcripts identified through the more statistically robust microarray strategy, and therefore it is not here used as a stand-alone discovery experiment.",
                                "The results show broad concordance with the Agilent analysis. In the leaf tissue, 2559 transcripts were identified as cycling in the leaf tissue. All of the core components identified as cycling by Agilent were also determined to be cycling under Illumina. There were 1378 transcripts that were identified as cycling by both technologies. As these transcripts were independently found by each distinct profiling platform, these transcripts serve as the most confident base set for cycling transcripts in photosynthetic (leaf) tissues of maize.",
                                "The developing ear Illumina profiling showed over twice as many cycling transcripts than Agilent, with 362 showing significant rhythms. Yet, while the number of cycling genes in developing ear increased, it remained small in comparison to the leaf photosynthetic tissue. Though the concordance between these distinct technologies was lower, 48 transcripts were still identified from ears as cycling in both platforms. Of these 48 transcripts that did cycle, 23 were identified by both the Agilent and Illumina technologies and in both leaf and ear tissues. Of the remaining 25, 24 were identified as cycling in three out of the four possible tests (Leaf Agilent, Leaf Illumina, Ear Agilent and Ear Illumina). These independent results confirm that the core oscillator is functioning in ear tissue.",

                                "The diurnal transcriptional profiles of maize are robust and similar to that of the model plant Arabidopsis in independent biological tissues and technical platforms. Results from the light receiving photosynthetic leaf tissue identified diurnal rhythms for as high as 22.7% (10K/44K probes) of the expressed transcripts using the Agilent technology. Using two independent transcriptome-wide analysis platforms, Agilent Microarrays and Illumina Tag Sequencing, compensates for the biases inherent to either technology and reveals a minimal core high confidence set of 1400 transcripts that are diurnally regulated.",
                                "In the non-photosynthetic developing ear, diurnal rhythms were not a significant contributor to the transcriptional program. Just 45 genes were identified as cycling either in ears only or in both ears and leaves. Among them 13 CAB (chlorophyll A/B transcripts) were found, now well-established markers of diurnal expression patterns in plants (Millar and Kay, (1991) Plant Cell 3:541-550). However, their amplitudes were severely attenuated in ears as compared to leaves. Eleven orthologs of the core oscillator system appear in this cross-tissue leaf-ear set. Therefore it appears that the core oscillator is active in ears. The core oscillator of plants has been described as an interlocking three or four loop process (Harmer, (2009); Ueda, (2006) Mol Syst Biol 2:60). The results indicate that the central feedback loop, consisting of ZmCCA1/ZmLHY and ZmTOC1a,b is conserved in maize. This loop shows extreme amplitude waves in leaf tissue and likely serves as the main driver for transcriptional output. In the ear tissue, the amplitude of these waves are attenuated, reduced 83% and 94% respectively, mainly by a reduction in peak transcriptional levels. The reduced height of the ear tissue wave pattern strongly points to persistent diurnal cycling but at decreased amplitude. It does not appear to be a de-synchronization of the diurnal pattern that might spread offsets in cycling patterns so as to mute or obscure the peak-trough wave pattern. If the ZmCCA1/ZmTOC1 loop does serve as the central zeitgeber, with its attenuated wave pattern, its relative contribution to signaling diurnal output genes should be severely reduced. The two exterior loops, containing such genes as ZmPRR73/ZmPRR37, gigz1/gigz2 and ZmZTLa/ZmZTLb also show significant reductions in wave amplitude.",
                                "One explanation for the decoupling of the core machinery from the output pathways in ears could be attributed to the low light intensity penetrating developing ears through the husk leaves (bracts) that are wrapped around ears. Transcriptional reinforcement of the diurnal expression pattern may occur via light sensing proteins such as the phytochromes and cryptochromes and therefore this reinforcement would be reduced accordingly in ears experiencing a relative absence of light. As shown in Arabidopsis, the core oscillator clock genes, such as CCA1 and LHY, are activated by light and mediate activation of the output CAB genes (Wang, et al., (1997)). The low amplitude of the core oscillators may therefore not generate enough protein to trigger transcription of the output pathways or do so feebly. A few output genes whose promoters might be sensitive to lower levels of the core oscillator products are activated but the overall transcriptional outputs has been effectively decoupled.",
                                "In ears there are few cycling genes that may be proximal translational nodes connecting the core oscillator to the output pathways. One of them is ZmMyb.L which has a peak of expression at 6 AM in leaves and ears. The ZmMYB.L protein shows a high degree of identity to the MYB domain of the morning phase genes CCA/LHY of both Arabidopsis and maize, extending even to including the distinctive SHAQKYFF protein motif. ZmMyb.L might have the orthologous function of Arabidopsis REVEILLE1, that integrates the circadian clock with the auxin pathway (Rawat, (2009)).",
                                "Microarray analysis of Arabidopsis root and shoot tissue grown has shown that a simplified version of the core oscillator does cycle in root non-photosynthetic tissue (James, et al., (2008) Science 322:1832-1835). According to that microarray expression study, 6518 transcripts are identified as cycling in shoot tissue compared with 335 in the root tissue. Those results largely agree with the hereby disclosed findings; that is, in largely non-photosynthetic tissues, whether root or ear, many components of the core oscillator function, but their transcriptional output is largely attenuated.",
                                "**Diurnal Physiological Functions**",
                                "Diurnal gene expression rhythms were studied in order to better understand the scope of diurnally regulated biology at the molecular level that could lead to opportunities to improve crop plant performance. (FIG. 5) These results reveal many aspects of the maize diurnal mechanism, from core clock genes, signaling and downstream effecter genes. The diurnal swing in maize leaf gene expression is pervasive, with thousands of genes and their attendant functions cycling in a diurnal tide. The apparent succession of physiological roles across the span of the day is intriguing and suggests specifically staged control of expression, but this may also be a natural progression of physiological events unfolding in response to both proximal and distal events in the diurnal rhythm. It is acknowledged that finer timepoint resolution will yield both more diurnally regulated transcripts, and also better delineate the succession of functional focusing across the day. This genome-wide diurnal profiling survey, the first for maize, coupled with assignments to over 1700 functional terms, has uncovered a durable outline of the succession of functional events in the day. It is clear that diurnal rhythms are complex and deeply woven into the biology of the cell and presumably it is adaptive to have coincident or coordinated expression of cellular machinery.",
                                "The presence of the bimodal functional enrichment pattern in the morning and afternoon/evening is intriguing and almost certainly reflects a fundamental activity in the plants daily regimen. More genes are peaking at the 10 AM and 6 PM timepoints and this will by itself cause more functional categories to which these genes belong to also peak at those times, resulting in this bimodal functional pattern. Although individual diurnally regulated genes are peaking at just one time during the day, the fact that the functional categories are bimodal, means that different genes under those functional umbrellas are peaking at different times. A possible connection to the recently described \u2018solar clock\u2019 that is calibrated to mid-day can now also be considered (Yeang, (2009) Bioessays 31:1211-1218). These morning and evening peaks could signify communication occurring between diurnally regulated genes and solar clock-regulated genes.",
                                "The diurnal patterns are strong in leaves, but feeble in developing ears. Developing ears are also the main sink for the photosynthetic source organs experiencing the throws of diurnal swings. Even if immature ears do not themselves have a marked internal diurnal drive, received from source organs might be expected to occur, as via waves of mobile signals and fixed carbon, to stir diurnal transcriptional action of some genes from outside. Yet, this is apparently not observed. Considering the times at which the few ear diurnally regulated genes peak during the day the functional enrichment suggests signal transduction and transcription in the morning, photosynthesis in the afternoon and core oscillator and transcriptional regulation in the evening.",
                                "Components of the core clock mechanism and proximal signaling mechanism emanating from it, could be modified in such manner as to positively affect crop performance, as by for example shifting or extending the relationship between sources and sinks such as leaves and ears. Wholesale genetic complementation of diurnal patterns from different germplasm sources has been shown augment the combined diurnal patterns and apparent fitness (Ni, (2009))."

                                "In the course of working out the maize gene models for ZmCCA1 and ZmLHY it was revealed that the genes are encoded by genic regions of circa 45 kb and 78 kb respectively (FIG. 4). Maize genes of this size are extremely rare, where the average gene size is closer to 4 kb (Bruggmann, et al., (2006) Genome Res 16:1241-1251). The exon-intron model of ZmCCA1 and ZmLHY genes was deduced from alignment of their cDNA and genomic sequences obtained from BAC sequencing. The ZmCCA1 gene is composed of 11 exons separated by 10 introns of various lengths. The longest are intron#2 (\u02dc9 kb) and intron#6 (\u02dc15.6 kb) which are rarely seen in maize genome. The translation start codon ATG is located in exon#5. This means that the untranslated 5\u2032 UTR is divided into 5 small exons ranging in the sizes of 40-200 bp. The ZmLHY gene is composed of 10 exons separated by 9 introns of various lengths. (It is likely that one of the small exon is missing in available ESTs). The intron 2 is \u221230.0 kb and intron 6 is \u02dc20.1 kb that are likely the largest introns in the maize genome. It is known that regulatory sequences controlling gene expression are often located in introns. The unusually long introns may play a role in ZmCCA1 and ZmLHY regulation. Both ZmCCA1 and ZmLHY genes are extremely long. Exceptionally long genes could slow transcription, thereby be a form of genomic regulation of gene expression. Similar to ZmCCA1 the translation start codon ATG is located in the exon 5. The complex exonic structures of the 5\u2032UTRs suggest that maturation of pre-mRNA may be the other level of regulation of these genes.",

Fields, J. C. Venter (Eds.), Automated DNA Sequencing and Analysis, Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, pp. 42-50). Briefly, after the BAC clones were isolated via a double-acetate cleared lysate protocol, they were sheared by nebulization and the resulting fragments were end-repaired and subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+). After transformation into DH-10B electro-competent Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) via electroporation, the colonies were picked with an automatic Q-Bot colony picker (Genetix) and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. in freezing media containing 6% glycerol and 100 \u03bcg/ml Ampicillin. Plasmids then were isolated, using the Templiphi DNA sequencing template amplification kit method (GE Healthcare). Briefly, the Templiphi method uses bacteriophage \u03c629 DNA polymerase to amplify circular single-stranded or double-stranded DNA by isothermal rolling circle amplification (Reagin, et al., (2003) J. Biomol. Techniques 14:143-148). The amplified products then were denatured at 95\u00b0 C. for 10 min and end-sequenced in 384-well plates, using vector-primed M13 oligonucleotides and the ABI BigDye version 3.1 Prism sequencing kit. After ethanol-based cleanup, cycle sequencing reaction products were resolved and detected on Perkin-Elmer ABI 3730\u00d71 automated sequencers, and individual sequences were assembled with the public domain Phred/Phrap/Consed package (on the world wide web at:phrap.org/phredphrapconsed.html). Contig order was viewed and confirmed with Exgap (A. Hua, University of Oklahoma, personal communication). Exgap is a local graphic tool that uses pair read information to order contigs generated by Phred, Phrap and Consed, and confirm the accuracy of the Phrap-based assembly. Subsequently, a majority of the sequencing gaps between contigs of interest were closed by sequencing plasmid DNA templates previously amplified with the Templiphi amplification kit method, in the presence of custom-designed sequencing primers and by inserting the resulting custom sequences to the original Phrap-based assemblies. Sequencing overlaps with public BAC DNA sequences (namely, ZMMBBc0099K11 (GenBank AC211312.1) and ZMMBBc0076L18 (GenBank AC213378.3) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's nucleotide database) also were used to confirm remaining gap sequences between contigs of interest."

                                "Genes involved in a variety of agronomic traits such as, for example, freezing tolerance, chilling or cold tolerance, drought tolerance, yield increase through improved metabolism are suitable for modulation by the diurnal regulatory elements disclosed herein. Optionally, these diurnal elements are used in combination with tissue specific promoters to optimize desired expression pattern of the genes of interest. For example, in an embodiment, genes that improve drought tolerance are expressed under the control of a diurnal regulatory element that exhibits a peak expression pattern around noon or late afternoon and in combination with a root-specific promoter element. Similarly, genes that improve tolerance to chilling and freezing are expressed under the control of a diurnal regulatory element that exhibits a peak expression pattern at dawn or night and in combination with a leaf-specific promoter element. In addition, genes that are involved in carbohydrate metabolism and source/sink relationships during photosynthesis are expressed under the control of diurnal promoter elements disclosed herein in combination with one or more tissue specific promoter elements. A variety of genes are known to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency (see, e.g., US Patent Application Publication Numbers US 2010/0223695; US 2010/0313304; US 2010/0269218). As shown in FIG. 5, genes belonging to various functional categories exhibit different diurnal expression pattern. For example, GO:0009651 response to salt stress peaks during mid-morning whereas GO:0008643 carbohydrate transport peaks at night.",

Promoters of the 144 maize genes were grouped by Zeitgeber time, the timing of their peak expression, Where ZT0=6 am, ZT4=10 am, ZT8=2 pm, ZT12=6 pm, ZT16=10 pm and ZT20=2 am. Each group of promoters was analyzed for the existence of motifs identified in the distant species Arabidopsis Thaliana.

Twelve of the promoters contain none of the motifs at all, spanning every time point. In the ZT12 peaking set, which includes the highly prevalent EE motif, 11/23 genes contained no canonical EE and as stated above, several contained no known motifs at all, indicating that other factors and motifs are at play causing the high amplitude observed waveforms, which nonetheless may be contained within the promoter sequences disclosed herein.",

No. 5,981,840 and PCT Publication Number WO98/32326, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). Briefly, immature embryos are isolated from maize and the embryos contacted with a suspension of Agrobacterium, where the bacteria are capable of transferring the transformation sequence to at least one cell of at least one of the immature embryos (step 1: the infection step). In this step the immature embryos are preferably immersed in an Agrobacterium suspension for the initiation of inoculation. The embryos are co-cultured for a time with the Agrobacterium (step 2: the co-cultivation step). Preferably the immature embryos are cultured on solid medium following the infection step. Following this co-cultivation period an optional \u201cresting\u201d step is contemplated. In this resting step, the embryos are incubated in the presence of at least one antibiotic known to inhibit the growth of Agrobacterium without the addition of a selective agent for plant transformants (step 3: resting step). Preferably the immature embryos are cultured on solid medium with antibiotic, but without a selecting agent, for elimination of Agrobacterium and for a resting phase for the infected cells. Next, inoculated embryos are cultured on medium containing a selective agent and growing transformed callus is recovered (step 4: the selection step). Preferably, the immature embryos are cultured on solid medium with a selective agent resulting in the selective growth of transformed cells. The callus is then regenerated into plants (step 5: the regeneration step) and preferably calli grown on selective medium are cultured on solid medium to regenerate the plants. Plants are monitored and scored for a modulation in meristem development. For instance, alterations of size and appearance of the shoot and floral meristems and/or increased yields of leaves, flowers and/or fruits."
