DNA DSBs may, potentially, damage living cells, tissues, or both, and may result in illness (for example, Acute Radiation Syndrome and cancer), death, or both. Identifying the amount of exposure to a DNA DSB-causing agent may be useful for determining the need for and nature of further testing and/or medical treatment. Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods and kits for measuring the amount of exposure of a host to a DNA DSB-causing agent."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The methods and kits of the invention provide many advantages. For example, because the inventive methods and kits quantify both \u03b3-H2AX and total H2AX, the inventive methods and kits may provide an accurate biodosimetric measurement of the amount of exposure of a host to a DNA DSB-causing agent. The inventive methods and kits also may provide the ratio of \u03b3-H2AX to total H2AX in a sample independent of any one or more of cell type, cell number, cell viability, cell lysis efficiency, and laboratory operator variability. In the inventive methods and kits, total H2AX may advantageously serve as an internal control that may account for differences in sample quality that may have arisen due to any one or more of specimen collection, storage, shipping, sample processing, extract preparation, and ELISA testing. Other advantages that may be provided by the inventive methods and kits include any one or more of lower background signals, greater sensitivity, and the ability to test patient tissue samples. The inventive methods and kits may provide a quantitative range of about 100-fold for both \u03b3-H2AX and total H2AX. The inventive methods and kits may also provide a sensitivity of at least about 5 pM for \u03b3-H2AX and at least about 50 pM for total H2AX. The inventive methods and kits may also advantageously measure an actual amount of protein (e.g., actual pictograms) as opposed to merely providing relative values of proteins. In addition, the inventive methods and kits may employ an immobilized antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to capture total H2A core protein and \u03b3-H2AX, which may reduce or eliminate the need to purify the antigen from complex mixtures prior to analysis, which may simplify the methods and increase the specificity and sensitivity of the methods. Moreover, the inventive methods and kits may provide a standardized clinical assay that can be used as a biodosimeter. The inventive methods may, advantageously, be completed rapidly (for example, within about one working day, less than about one working day, or more than about one working day). The inventive methods may, advantageously screen agents for the ability to cause DNA DSB after a short treatment with the agent(s) to be screened in vitro (e.g., about 1 hr, less than about 1 hr, more than about 1 hr). The inventive methods may, for example, be suitable for high-throughput screening (for example, about 100 to about 5000 cells per well) and may be carried out using a plate-based immunoassay, for example, a 96/384 plate-based immunoassay. Because the cell extract employed in the inventive methods may also be used for additional, conventional immunoassays such as, for example Western Blot (WB), the inventive methods and kits may also be compatible with other, additional assays in order to, for example, further identify potential downstream targets and carry out mechanistic and molecular studies (e.g., PARP1 assays, Top1 assays, and LUMINEX protein assays for apoptosis (Invitrogen, Waltham, Mass.)). Without being bound to a particular theory or mechanism, it is also believed that because \u03b3-H2AX forms at a biological endpoint as opposed to an intermediate biochemical step, the inventive methods provide a more comprehensive measurement of DNA DSB because the inventive methods cover \u03b3-H2AX formed by multiple biochemical enzymatic targets and pathways.",
                        "The inventive methods and kits may also advantageously overcome one or more obstacles to obtaining an accurate biodosimetric measurement using other methods such as those that involve counting \u201cnuclear foci\u201d through a microscope. \u201cNuclear foci\u201d refer to areas surrounding the DSB, which may be microscopically detected and counted using an anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody. However, because each focus contains a certain percentage of the total nuclear H2AX, and the total H2AX content may vary from cell type to cell type, methods that involve counting nuclear foci lack the total H2AX value necessary to convert those data into biodosimetric measurements. The inventive methods and kits may advantageously overcome one or more of these obstacles.",
                        "An embodiment of the invention provides a method of measuring the amount of exposure of a host to a DNA DSB-causing agent. The DNA DSB-causing agent may be any agent that causes DNA DSBs. Non-limiting examples of DNA DSB-causing agents include IR (such as, for example, X-rays and gamma rays), environmental agents such as, for example, ultraviolet (UV) light, reactive oxygen species, mutagenic chemicals, cigarette smoke, and radiation from, for example, cell phones, and drugs such as, for example, anti-cancer agents (e.g., bleomycin and topotecan).",
                        "In response to DSB formation, cells phosphorylate the histone protein H2AX. In this regard, the method may comprise contacting (i) a first portion of a positive control biological sample and (ii) a first portion of a biological sample from the host with an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to phosphorylated H2AX (gamma (\u03b3)-H2AX) and forms a first complex with the \u03b3-H2AX.",
                        "The biological samples (from the host and the positive control biological sample) may comprise any suitable biological sample. The biological samples can comprise any solubilized homogenate or extract from any suitable biological material. Non-limiting examples include tissues, serum, plasma, urine, sputum, saliva, whole cells, cell lysate, or a fraction of the cell lysates, e.g., a nuclear or cytoplasmic fraction, a whole protein fraction, or an acid extract of histones. If the sample comprises whole cells, the cells can be any cells of the host, e.g., the cells of any organ or tissue, including blood cells or cancer cells. In an embodiment of the invention, the cells may be hair bulb cells. Hair bulbs contain dividing cells and are believed to be more sensitive to drug effects. In an embodiment of the invention, the source material may be from any eukaryotic source such as, for example, invertebrates (such as, for example, yeast), and vertebrates. Preferably, the biological samples comprise cell lysate. In an embodiment of the invention, the biological samples comprise cell lysate from no more than a single cell type. In another embodiment of the invention, the biological samples comprise cell lysates from two or more cell types, for example, normal and abnormal tissues, such as those in a tumor biopsy. In an embodiment of the invention, the biological sample is a cancer cell or a lysate of a cancer cell. Regardless of the origin or composition of the biological sample from the host, the positive control biological sample is preferably identical to the biological sample from the host with the exception that the positive control biological sample has been exposed to a known amount of the DSB-causing agent.",
                        "The host may be any eukaryote such as, for example, an invertebrate (such as, for example, yeast) or vertebrate. Mammals are the preferred host. The mammalian host may be, for example, of the order Rodentia, such as mice and hamsters, or of the order Logomorpha, such as rabbits. The host may be from the order Carnivora, including Felines (cats) and Canines (dogs). The host may be from the order Artiodactyla, including Bovines (cows) and Swines (pigs) or of the order Perssodactyla, including Equines (horses). The host may be of the order Primates, Ceboids, or Simoids (monkeys) or of the order Anthropoids (humans and apes). Most preferably, the host is a human.",
                        "The antibody and antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically bind to \u03b3-H2AX are also collectively referred to herein as \u201canti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody\u201d or \u201canti-\u03b3-H2AX antibodies.\u201d The anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody binds to \u03b3-H2AX with measurably higher affinity to \u03b3-H2AX than to other molecules. In an embodiment of the invention, the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody may specifically bind to the carboxyl terminus of \u03b3-H2AX (SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the serine in the first position of SEQ ID NO: 1 is phosphorylated), and does not bind to the carboxyl terminus of non-phosphorylated H2AX (SEQ ID NO: 3, wherein the serine in the first position of SEQ ID NO: 3 is not phosphorylated). In an embodiment of the invention, the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody may specifically bind to \u03b3-H2AX (SEQ ID NO: 2, wherein the serine at position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 2 is phosphorylated), and does not bind to non-phosphorylated H2AX (SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein the serine at position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 3 is not phosphorylated). Suitable anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,884,873 and 6,362,317, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibodies are also commercially available (from, for example, Millipore (Billerica, Mass.)).",
                        "While the contacting may take place in vitro or in vivo with respect to the host, preferably, the contacting is in vitro. Contacting a biological sample with the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody may comprise physically contacting the biological sample with the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody such that the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody binds to \u03b3-H2AX that is present in the sample. The binding of the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody to the \u03b3-H2AX forms a first complex that comprises the \u03b3-H2AX bound to the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody.",
                        "The method may further comprise contacting (i) a second portion of the positive control biological sample and (ii) a second portion of the biological sample from the host with an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to an H2A core protein and forms a second complex with the H2A core protein. The antibody and antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically bind to the H2A core protein are also collectively referred to herein as \u201canti-H2A core protein antibody\u201d or \u201canti-H2A core protein antibodies.\u201d The anti-H2A core protein antibody binds to H2A core protein with measurably higher affinity to H2A core protein than to other molecules. In an embodiment of the invention, the anti-H2A core protein antibody specifically binds to H2A core protein that is present in the sample, such as, for example, H2A1, H2A2, H2AX (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated), and H2AZ. In this regard, the anti-H2A core protein antibody captures all H2A proteins that are present in the biological sample (total H2A), including H2AX (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated). Accordingly, the second complex may comprise anti-H2A core protein antibody bound to phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated H2AX. Anti-H2A core protein antibodies are commercially available from companies such as, for example, Novus (St. Charles, Mo.).",
                        "Contacting a biological sample with the anti-H2A core protein antibody may comprise physically contacting the biological sample with the anti-H2A core protein antibody such that the anti-H2A core protein antibody binds to H2A core protein that is present in the sample. The binding of the anti-H2A core protein antibody with the anti-H2A core protein forms a second complex that comprises the H2A core protein bound to the anti-H2A core protein antibody.",
                        "The contacting of the biological sample(s) with the anti-\u03b3-H2AX antibody and the contacting of the biological sample(s) with the anti-H2A core protein antibody may take place simultaneously or in any sequence.
