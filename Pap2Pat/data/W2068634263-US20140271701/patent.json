                "The present invention concerns epitopes of Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and antibodies recognizing thereof and cross-reacting with the beta-cell antigen znt8 as early biomarkers of type 1 diabetes.",
                "Particularly, the present invention provide with antibodies recognizing Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis epitopes able to cross-reacting with the beta-cell antigen ZnT8 to be used as early biomarkers of type 1 diabetes, epitopes for in vitro prognostic and diagnostic methods suitable to reveal a risk to develop type 1 diabetes, a therapy for the prevention of T1D by avoiding, controlling or monitoring Mycobacterium paratuberculosis infection.",
                "Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is transmitted from dairy herds to humans through food contamination. MAP causes an asymptomatic infection, which is highly prevalent in Sardinian T1 D patients compared with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and healthy controls. Moreover, MAP elicits humoral responses against several mycobacterial proteins.",
                "Type 1 diabetes (T1 D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease resulting from the destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic 13 cells. It is a paradigmatic example of autoimmune disease stemming from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. While several genetic susceptibility loci have been pinpointed, the environmental factors at play remain boldly elusive. Yet, environmental factors play a prominent role in T1D pathogenesis, as suggested by the incomplete (\u221265%) T1D concordance between monozygotic twins, by migrant studies or by the decreasing weight of susceptible and protective HLA Class II haplotypes over the last decades.",
                "Among the environmental factors that have been called forth, viral infections\u2014particularly enteroviruses\u2014have received overarching attention. While epidemiological studies show a temporal correlation between enteroviral infections and appearance of anti-islet auto-antibodies (aAbs), investigations using the NOD mouse model suggest that enteroviral infections may accelerate rather than initiate T1D progression, as they are effective only once autoimmune T cells have already accumulated in the islets. The pathophysiological mechanisms through which enteroviral infections may favor T1 D development include promoting local islet inflammation, cytolytic effects on \u03b2 cells and molecular mimicry. This latter concept has been proposed based on aminoacid sequence homologies and/or immune cross-reactivity between viral and \u03b2-cell epitopes.",
                "The role of bacterial infections as T1D triggers or accelerators have received comparatively less attention. Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease), a chronic enteritis that affects dairy herds. Environmental contamination with MAP is widespread, as MAP is detected in cattle's feces, soil, water (where it survives chlorination), it is shed into milk and is found in commercially pasteurized dairy preparations and meat products. Although transmitted to man, MAP infection is asymptomatic in human carriers and is not therefore regarded as a zoonosis, nor subjected to eradication in contaminated animals.",
                "Counting \u02dc1.8 million inhabitants, \u02dc3.5 millions sheeps and approximately two hundred thousand cattle, MAP exposure may be particularly high in the Western Mediterranean island of Sardinia, where it is estimated that \u02dc60% of flocks may be contaminated. Sardinia is also one of the regions with the highest incidence of T1D and multiple sclerosis (MS) worldwide, a notable exception in the north-south gradient followed by these autoimmune diseases.",
                "During the period preceding T1 D clinical onset, autoantibodies (aAbs) directed to islets antigens such as insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), insulinoma associated protein-2 (IA-2) and zinc transporter 8 (Znt8) may be detectable for months up to years before disease onset and progressively wane after diagnosis. For instance, WO2008/083331 (Hutton et al.) discloses ZnT8 epitopes consisting of the C-terminal amino acids as epitopes related with the risk of T1 D development. It is also commercially available RSR ZnT8 Ab ELISA kit (RSR Limited, Avenue Park Pentwyn Cardiff CF23 8HE United Kingdom, Tel.: +44 29 2073 2076 Fax: +44 29 2073 2704 Email: info@rsrltd.com Website: www.rsrltd.com). This kit searches and identifies Abs against residues 275-369 inclusive of the human ZnT8 protein and is also capable of detecting and quantifying autoantibodies (aAbs) specific to R(Arg) 325 or to W(Trp) 325 variant or to residue Q (Glu) 325 non specific variant.",
                "The inventors have found that Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection is a risk factor for T1D in the Sardinian population. The inventors have reported that anti-MAP and anti-ZnT8 Abs targeting homologous membrane-spanning sequences are cross-reactive and capable of eliciting strong immune responses in T1D patients, opening the possibility of a molecular mimicry mechanism precipitating disease. Particularly, the inventors have found that antibodies (Abs) against MAP3865c, which displays a sequence homology with the \u03b2-cell protein zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), are cross-reactive with ZnT8 epitopes. Ab responses against MAP3865c were analyzed in Sardinian T1D, T2D and healthy subjects using an enzymatic immunoassay. Abs against MAP3865c recognized two immunodominant transmembrane epitopes in 52-65% of T1 D patients, but only in 5-7% of T2D and 3-5% of healthy controls. There was a linear correlation between titers of anti-MAP3865c and anti-ZnT8 Abs targeting these two homologous epitopes, and pre-incubation of sera with ZnT8 epitope peptides blocked binding to the corresponding MAP3865c peptides. These results demonstrate that Abs recognizing MAP3865c epitopes cross-react with ZnT8, underlying a molecular mimicry mechanism which may precipitate T1D in MAP-infected individuals.",
                "MAP3865c is a 298 aminoacid 6-membrane-spanning channel which endows MAP with the ability to transport cations through the membrane, an important feature associated with intracellular survival of mycobacteria. ZnT8 is a 369 aminoacid protein which belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator family of ZnT (Slc30) proteins. It displays a remarkably similar structure and function, allowing Zn2+ to accumulate in the insulin granules of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Zn2+ cations are essential to form hexavalent insulin storage crystals and, eventually, for effective insulin secretion. Most of the 71 aminoacid difference in length between MAP3865c and ZnT8 is made up by the first extra-luminal domain, which is much shorter for MAP3865c (FIG. 3B).",
                "To look for potential cross-reactive Ab epitopes, the analysis has been focused on a trasmembrane region of high homology. Ab reactivities against peptide sequences of this region were even more prevalent in T1D patients than those against the whole MAP3865c protein, perhaps reflecting masking of these hydrophobic epitopes in the solubilized MAP3865c protein. Importantly, Abs against this membrane-spanning epitopes would not be detected by conventional anti-ZnT8 aAb assays, which employ a fusion protein combining the 4 extra-luminal domains of ZnT8. Other regions of high homology are mostly located in these extra-luminal domains, raising the possibility that other cross-reactive epitopes may be recognized by other Abs, including conventional anti-ZnT8 aAbs. Of further note, the transmembrane region identified here does not comprise the polymorphic ZnT8 R/W variant at position 325, which is located in the last extra-luminal domain, thus making it unlikely that the ZnT8 genetic background may shape these Ab reactivities, as described for conventional anti-ZnT8 aAbs.",
                "The intestinal localization of MAP infection may also favor cross-reactivity with Abs and T cells recognizing ZnT8. Indeed, the first encounter with \u03b2-cell antigens takes place in pancreatic lymph nodes, which also drain intestinal tissues. Epitope mimicry and spreading may be further favored by high precursor frequencies of ZnT8-reactive na\u00efve T cells. As ZnT8 has not been found expressed by medullary thymic epithelial cells, negative selection of ZnT8-reactive T cells may be ineffective.",
                "Thus, tolerance to ZnT8 may heavily rely on peripheral mechanisms such as immune ignorance, which may be readily overcome by MAP infection. The intestinal localization of MAP infection may also give reason for the lack of correlation between MAP IS900 DNA and Ab detection. Not all MAP-infected individuals may mount systemic Ab responses detectable in blood, or they may develop Abs against other MAP antigens.",
                "In addition to the above, the inventors have investigated the seroreactivity against the identified ZnT8/MAP epitopes in children with new-onset T1 D and hyperglycemia (Hy) compared to healthy controls (HCs). This study shows that ZnT8/MAP peptides are recognized in new-onset T1 D. Therefore, Abs against the epitopes of the invention can be used as early markers of T1 D in pediatric population.",
                "On the basis of the above, the present invention provides an in vitro method for diagnosing if an individual is susceptible to or is developing T1 D. The diagnostic method of the invention is more sensitive in comparison to known diagnostic methods, such as the method based on the epitopes disclosed in WO2008083331 to be performed by the commercially available RSR ZnT8 Ab ELISA kit.",
                "The method of the invention is useful for monitoring the progression of T1D and allows to intervene in time with a treatment for preventing or delaying the onset of T1 D, for instance by avoiding, controlling or monitoring Mycobacterium paratuberculosis infection.",

Competition assays demonstrated that these epitopes are immunodominant Ab targets within the full-length MAP3865c protein, as sera pre-adsorbed with these peptides, either alone or in combination, were capable of blocking binding to the MAP3865c-MBP fusion protein, to a similar extent to what observed when pre-adsorbing sera with the MAP3865c-MBP protein itself (FIG. 4).",

The similar frequencies of Abs recognizing MAP3865c and ZnT8 homologous regions among T1D patients (65.4-68.0% and 51.6-55.6%, respectively; FIG. 5) suggest that Abs targeting these epitopes could be cross-reactive. Indeed, there was a high degree of correlation between the titers of Abs recognizing MAP3865c and ZnT8 homologous sequences in both T1D patients and healthy controls (FIG. 7A-B; 12=0.74 for MAP3865c125-133 vs ZnT8178-186 and r2=0.58 for MAP3865c133-141 vs ZnT8186-194; p<0.0001). This correlation was maintained when the analysis was restricted to either T1D patients or healthy controls (data not shown). This demonstrates that anti-MAP3865c and anti-ZnT8 Abs recognizing homologous sequences segregate within the same sera. The same was true for Ab reactivities against the two neighboring regions MAP3865c125-133 and MAP3865c133-141 and for ZnT8178-186 and ZnT8186-194 (FIG. 7C-D; r2=0.67 and 0.74, respectively; p<0.0001), suggesting that recognition of these epitopes stems from an immune response against the whole MAP3865c/ZnT8 transmembrane region to which they belong.",
                                "To verify whether co-segregation of these reactivities was due to Ab specificities cross-reacting between each other, competition experiments were performed. Anti-MAP3865c125-133-positive and negative sera were pre-adsorbed overnight with different peptides, then subjected to ELISA on MAP3865c125-133-coated plates (FIG. 8A). While a control peptide did not cause any decrease in signal, both MAP3865c125-133 and its homologous ZnT8178-186 peptide strongly inhibited the MAP3865c125-133 reactivity to a similar extent (57-89%). The same observation was repeated with the MAP3865c133-141 reactivity, which was efficiently inhibited (55-66%) upon serum preadsorption with either MAP3865c133-141 or its homologous ZnT8186-194 (FIG. 8B).
