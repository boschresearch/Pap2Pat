    "title": "A Motion Detection Algorithm Using Local Phase Information",
    "date": "2016-01-01",
    "abstract": "Previous research demonstrated that global phase alone can be used to faithfully represent visual scenes. Here we provide a reconstruction algorithm by using only local phase information. We also demonstrate that local phase alone can be effectively used to detect local motion. The local phase-based motion detector is akin to models employed to detect motion in biological vision, for example, the Reichardt detector. The local phase-based motion detection algorithm introduced here consists of two building blocks. The first building block measures/evaluates the temporal change of the local phase. The temporal derivative of the local phase is shown to exhibit the structure of a second order Volterra kernel with two normalized inputs. We provide an efficient, FFT-based algorithm for implementing the change of the local phase. The second processing building block implements the detector; it compares the maximum of the Radon transform of the local phase derivative with a chosen threshold. We demonstrate examples of applying the local phase-based motion detection algorithm on several video sequences. We also show how the locally detected motion can be used for segmenting moving objects in video scenes and compare our local phase-based algorithm to segmentation achieved with a widely used optic flow algorithm.",

                "Following Marr, the design of an information processing system can be approached on multiple levels [1].  Figure 1 illustrates two levels of abstraction, namely, the algorithmic level and the physical circuit level. On the algorithmic level, one studies procedurally how the information is processed independently of the physical realization. The circuit level concerns the actual realization of the algorithm in physical hardware, for example, a biological neural circuit or silicon circuits in a digital signal processor. In this paper, we put forth a simple motion detection algorithm that is inspired by motion detection models of biological visual systems (in vivo neural circuit) and provide an efficient realization that can easily be implemented on commodity (in silico) DSP chips.",
                "Visual motion detection is critical to the survival of animals. Many biological visual systems have evolved highly efficient/effective neural circuits to detect visual motion. Motion detection is performed in parallel with other visual coding circuits and starts already in the early stages of visual processing. In the retina of vertebrates, it is known that at least three types of Direction-Selective Ganglion Cells (DSGC) are responsible for signaling visual motion at this early stage [2]. In flies, direction-selective neurons are found in the optic lobe, 3 synapses away from the photoreceptors [3].",
                "The small number of synapses between photoreceptors and direction-selective neurons suggests that the processing involved in motion detection is not highly complex but still very effective. In addition, the biological motion detection circuits are organized in a highly parallel way to enable fast, concurrent computation of motion. It is also interesting to note that the early stages of motion detection are carried out largely in the absence of spiking neurons, indicating that initial stages of motion detection are preferably performed in the \u201canalog\u201d domain. Taking advantage of continuous time processing may be critical for quickly processing motion since motion intrinsically elicits fast and large changes in the intensity levels, that is, large amounts of data under stringent time constraints.",
                "Modern, computer-based motion detection algorithms often employ optic flow techniques to estimate spatial changes in consecutive image frames [4, 5]. Although, often time, optic flow estimation algorithms produce accurate results, the computational demand to perform many of these algorithms is too high for real-time implementation.",
                "Several models for biological motion detection are available and their architecture is quite simple [6]. The Reichardt motion detector [7] was thought to be the underlying model for motion detection in insects [8]. The model is based on a correlation method to extract motion induced by spatiotemporal information patterns of light intensity. Therefore, it relies on a correlation/multiplication operation. A second model is the motion energy detector [9]. It uses spatiotemporal separable filters and a squaring nonlinearity to compute motion energy and it was shown to be equivalent to the Reichardt motion detector. Earlier work in the rabbit retina was the foundation to the Barlow-Levick model [10] of motion detection. The model relies on inhibition to compensate motion in the null direction.",
                "In this paper, we provide an alternative motion detection algorithm based on local phase information of the visual scene. Similar to mechanisms in other biological models, it operates in continuous time and in parallel. Moreover, the motion detection algorithm we propose can be efficiently implemented on parallel hardware. This is, again, similar to the properties of biological motion detection systems. Rather than focusing on velocity of motion, we focus on localization, that is, where the motion occurs in the visual field as well as the direction of motion.",
                "It has been shown that images can be represented by their global phase alone [11]. Here we provide a reconstruction algorithm of visual scenes by only using local phase information, thereby demonstrating the spectrum of the representational capability of phase information.",
                "The Fourier shift property clearly suggests the relationship between the global shift of an image and the global phase shift in the frequency domain. We elevate this relationship by computing the change of local phase to indicate motion that appears locally in the visual scene. The local phases are computed using window functions that tile the visual field with overlapping segments, making it amenable for a highly parallel implementation. In addition, we propose a Radon-transform-based motion detection index on the change of local phases for the readout of the relation between local phases and motion.",
                "Interestingly, phase information has been largely ignored in the field of linear signal processing and for good reason. Phase-based processing is intrinsically non-linear. Recent researches, however, showed that phase information can be smartly employed in speech processing [12] and visual processing [13]. For example, spatial phase in an image is indicative of local features such as edges when considering phase congruency [14]. The role of spatial phase in computational and biological vision, emergence of visual illusions, and pattern recognition is discussed in [15]. Together with our result for motion detection, these studies suggest that phase information has a great potential for achieving efficient visual signal processing.",
                "This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we show that local phase information can be used to faithfully represent visual information in the absence of amplitude information. In Section 3, we develop a simple local phase-based algorithm to detect motion in visual scenes and provide an efficient way for its implementation. We then provide examples and applications of the proposed motion detection algorithm to motion segmentation. We also compare our results to those obtained using motion detection algorithms based on optic flow techniques in Section 4. Finally, we summarize our results in Section 5."

When represented in polar coordinates, the output of a complex valued transform of a signal can be split into amplitude and phase. In this section, we define two types of phases of an image: global phase and local phase. We then argue that both types of phases can faithfully represent an image and we provide a reconstruction algorithm that recovers the image from local phase information. This indicates that phase information alone can largely represent an image or video signal.",

The full video of this example can be found in Supplementary Video S1; see Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/7915245. Figure 6(a) depicts a still from the \u201chighway video\u201d in the Change Detection 2014 dataset [22] evaluated at a particular time t 0. As suggested by the algorithm, the screen in Figure 6(a) is divided into 26 \u00d7 19 overlapping blocks and the window functions are applied to each block. Local phases can then be extracted from the 2D FFT of each windowed block, and the local phase changes are obtained by temporal high-pass filtering. The phase change is shown in Figure 6(b) for all blocks, with block (12,11) enlarged in Figure 6(c) and block (23,6) enlarged in Figure 6(d) (see also the plane \u201c2D FFT and extract phase change\u201d in Figure 5).

For these blocks the maximum of |(d\u03d5 kl/dt)(\u03c9 x, \u03c9 y, t 0)| over all (\u03c9 x, \u03c9 y) \u2208 \ud835\udd3b 2 is comparable to the maximum obtained for blocks that cover the vehicles in motion.",

Given the block structure employed in the computation of the local phase, it is natural to utilize phase change information from multiple sources.",

For example, in Figures 6(b) and 6(c), (d\u03d5 kl/dt)(\u03c9 x, \u03c9 y, t 0) clearly exhibits this property for blocks that cover a vehicle in motion. The PMI is a tool to evaluate this property.",

The figure shows clearly that the blocks corresponding to the two moving vehicles have a high PMI value while the stationary background areas have a low PMI value, allowing one to easily detect motion by employing simple thresholding (see also the plane \u201cRadon transform and extract strength orientation of plane\u201d in Figure 5). In addition, the orientation of motion in each block is readily observable even by inspection in Figure 6(b) by a line separating the yellow part and blue part in each block. Further results about the direction of motion are presented in Section 4."

The phase-based motion detection algorithm captured both the moving cars and the tree leaves moving (due to the wind). In the time interval between the 9th and 10th second, the camera was slightly moved left- and right-wards within 5 frames, again possibly due to the wind. Movement due to this shift was captured by the motion detection algorithm and the algorithm was fast enough to correctly determine the direction of this movement. In this video, we already noted that this algorithm suffers from the aperture problem. For example, in front of the van where a long, horizontal edge is present, the detected motion is mostly pointing downwards. In addition to moving downwards, the edge is also moving to the left, however. This is expected since the algorithm only detects motion locally and does not take into account the overall shape of any object.",

In addition, motion is still detected in some parts of the screen where the vehicles have just passed by. The detection result for the Barlow-Levick motion detector was poorer. In particular, the response to OFF edge movement is always the opposite to the actual movement direction.",

For reference, the motion detection results for the original video are shown in red arrows. Motion detected in the low-contrast video is shown in blue arrows if no motion is detected for the block in the original video. If motion is detected in both the original and the low-contrast video, the arrows are shown in magenta. Figure 9 clearly shows that while the motion detection performance is degraded for all three detectors, the phase-based motion detector performed still quite well in the low-contrast video, detecting most of the moving vehicles.

For example, in the case of phase-based motion detector, we computed, for each block, the ratio between the PMI index for the lower contrast video and that for the full contrast video. The ratios are then averaged across all blocks where motion is detected in the full contrast video. This average for different contrasts is shown in Figure 10 by the blue curve. In the ideal case when the normalization constant \u03f5 is 0, the phase detector should produce invariant responses to videos with different contrast. The curve shown here is mainly due to a nonzero \u03f5. The ratios for the Reichardt motion detector and the Barlow-Levick motion detector are computed similarly and are shown in red and yellow, respectively. It is clear that the phase-based motion detector has a superior performance across a range of contrast values. At 20% contrast, the phase-based detector still has 50% of the PMI index value for full contrast video. As expected, the response of Barlow-Levick motion detector is linear with respect to contrast, and the Reichardt motion detector has a quadratic relation to contrast. For a fixed threshold value a larger ratio equates to a more consistent performance at lower contrast.",

Therefore, only the cars were identified as moving objects and they are indicated in red. Although the moving objects were not perfectly segmented on their boundary, they were mostly captured. For the optic flow based segmentation, since the regions of interest are set by thresholding the length of the velocity vector, objects moving at lower speed, for example, the cars on the top, were not always picked up by the segmentation algorithm.",

                "Previous research demonstrated that global phase information alone can be used to faithfully represent visual scenes. Here we provided a reconstruction algorithm of visual scenes by only using local phase information. More importantly, local phase information can be effectively used to detect local motion. Through a simple temporal derivative of the phase, we obtained a second order Volterra kernel that is applied on two normalized inputs. The structure of the second order Volterra kernel in the phase-based motion detector is akin to models employed to detect motion in biological vision, for example, the Reichardt detector [7] and the motion energy detector [9].",
                "We then proposed an efficient, FFT-based algorithm employing the change in local phase for detecting motion. In order to exploit the special structure of the change in phase in the frequency domain that is due to rigid motion, the phase-based motion detection algorithm also incorporates the Radon transform, a transform closely related to the Fourier transform. Based on the Radon transform, a motion indicator was proposed to robustly detect whether the phase change is caused by motion. Therefore, the algorithm can be efficiently implemented whenever the FFT is available/supported. We showed examples of applying the phase-based motion detection algorithm on several video sequences. We also showed that the locally detected motion can be used for segmenting moving objects in video scenes. We compared the segmentation of moving objects using our local phase-based algorithm to segmentation achieved using a widely used optic flow based algorithm. Our results suggest that spatial phase information may provide an efficient alternative to perform many visual tasks in silico as well as in modeling in vivo biological vision systems. This is consistent with other recent findings [15].",
                "Note that phase information has been used for solving various visual tasks in the past. In fact, phase has been successfully employed in optic flow algorithms [24] and image registration for translation [25], both applied to motion related tasks. The phase-based optic flow algorithm applies the optic flow equation on the local phase of images rather than the intensity itself to achieve better resolution and robustness in estimating motion velocity. The phase correlation method computes the normalized cross-power spectrum of two images to extract the phase difference. It provides better accuracy and robustness as compared to the classical cross correlation approach applied to two consecutive images in a sequence. However, it has limitations when dealing with images with a repetitive structure.",
                "Our method differs from the above two cases in the following ways. First, it employs a simple temporal derivative/high-pass filtering on the phase to extract local phase changes. The structure of the phase change is exploited for better detection of motion. On the contrary, the phase correlation method considers the structure of the phase itself. This also allowed us to make the motion detection a more local, continuous process rather than purely operating globally on discrete frames. Second, it explores the structure of the change of phase due to motion in the frequency domain rather than in the spatial domain, in which the key constraints of optic flow equations are based. Third, instead of focusing on estimating the exact velocity or shift, our method is centered on the detection of motion with a coarse local estimate of direction. This is the case in the first steps of biological motion detection in the retina or optic lobe of insects; we discussed the resemblance of the method presented here to those of biological models of motion detection.",
                "The proposed motion detection algorithm, however, shares several advantages with the other phase-based methods. For example, it is sensitive to motion that only induces a subpixel shift between frames and for very small differences in intensity. In addition, when compared to the amplitude, the local phase is robust under different contrast and illumination conditions. Consequently, the algorithm presented here can operate in a wide range of contrast/illumination conditions.",
                "Furthermore, once the local phase is extracted from each block, motion detection becomes a localized, temporal operation on the local phase of each block. This forms the basis for the highly parallel structure in the phase-based motion detection algorithm. By contrast, traditional optic flow techniques often rely on explicit comparisons across spatial locations, which increase, for example, memory complexity since all states must be made available to their neighbors.",
                "We also notice that, for each block, a large number of measurements of phase changes are obtained. From Figure 6, we see that this number is much higher than that of the original pixel space. In other words, in order to detect motion in a robust way, the local phase-based motion detection algorithm undergoes an expansion of measurements before settling down onto a single motion indicator value. This number of measurements, however, does not incur additional computational demand thanks to the highly efficient FFT algorithm. Biological visual systems often have a similar structure. For example, in the vertebrate retina, computations are carried out by an extraordinarily large number of neurons until measurements of the visual scene are projected by a fraction of the neurons onto the cortex [26]. Similar expansion takes place in the primary visual cortex as well.",
                "We also highlight the ease of implementation of the intrinsically parallel algorithm proposed here. The algorithm introduced in Section 3.3 is based on the FFT algorithm and does not require solving an optimization problem. It can be efficiently implemented in hardware, for example, FPGAs, or in software, for example, using GPU accelerators. We note that extending the FFT to higher dimensions is straightforward and the implementations of higher dimensional FFTs are also highly efficient. Clearly, the methodology can be applied to motion detection of data in 3D or higher dimensional space, where the Radon transform operates over planes or hyperplanes.",
                "Finally, we argue that the change of phase, although highly nonlinear, can be obtained through a normalization (gain control) followed by a second order Volterra kernel. This separation of a higher order nonlinearity into gain control block and a lower order nonlinear filter can be used for modeling motion detection circuits in biological systems."
