    "title": "A High-Performance System for Robust Stain Normalization of Whole-Slide Images in Histopathology",
    "date": "2019-09-30",
    "abstract": "Stain normalization is an important processing task for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in modern digital pathology. This task reduces the color and intensity variations present in stained images from different laboratories. Consequently, stain normalization typically increases the prediction accuracy of CAD systems. However, there are computational challenges that this normalization step must overcome, especially for real-time applications: the memory and run-time bottlenecks associated with the processing of images in high resolution, e.g., 40X. Moreover, stain normalization can be sensitive to the quality of the input images, e.g., when they contain stain spots or dirt. In this case, the algorithm may fail to accurately estimate the stain vectors. We present a high-performance system for stain normalization using a state-of-the-art unsupervised method based on stain-vector estimation. Using a highly-optimized normalization engine, our architecture enables high-speed and large-scale processing of high-resolution whole-slide images. This optimized engine integrates an automated thresholding technique to determine the useful pixels and uses a novel pixel-sampling method that significantly reduces the processing time of the normalization algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our architecture using measurements from images of different sizes and scanner formats that belong to four different datasets. The results show that our optimizations achieve up to 58x speedup compared to a baseline implementation. We also prove the scalability of our system by showing that the processing time scales almost linearly with the amount of tissue pixels present in the image. Furthermore, we show that the output of the normalization algorithm can be adversely affected when the input images include artifacts. To address this issue, we enhance the stain normalization pipeline by introducing a parameter cross-checking technique that automatically detects the distortion of the algorithm\u2019s critical parameters. To assess the robustness of the proposed method we employ a machine learning (ML) pipeline that classifies images for detection of prostate cancer. The results show that the enhanced normalization algorithm increases the classification accuracy of the ML pipeline in the presence of poor-quality input images. For an exemplary ML pipeline, our new method increases the accuracy on an unseen dataset from 0.79 to 0.87.",

                "With the advent of high-resolution whole-slide imaging technology and the advances in deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have become a very important part of the clinical work today. Machine learning (ML) based image analysis algorithms applied to digitized histological slides can assist the pathologists in terms of workload reduction, efficient decision support, and interpretability of the results (1\u20133). Given the vast amount of gigapixel-sized whole-slide imaging data, and the need to accelerate the time-to-insight, there is an increasing demand to build automated and scalable pipelines for large-scale, fast, and robust image analysis.",
                "One of the main pre-processing algorithms in whole-slide image (WSI) analysis is the color normalization of stained tissue samples (4). Despite the standardized staining protocols, variations in the staining results are still frequent due to differences in, e.g., the antigen concentration and incubation time and temperature, the different conditions across slide scanners etc. (3). Such color/intensity variations can adversely affect the performance and accuracy of the CAD systems. Stain normalization methods aim to help the CAD systems by generating images with a standardized appearance of the different stains (5\u201312).",
                "In this work, we use the Macenko method (7) to build a high-performance stain normalization system. This method estimates the stain vectors of the WSI of interest by using a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach applied to the non-background pixels of the input image. Using the normalized median intensity (NMI) metric, it was shown in Zanjani et al. (13), that the quality of this method is one of the highest when compared to other stain normalization methods. In addition, due to the simplicity of the algorithmic steps, the particular method can be efficiently parallelized. Moreover, the algorithm does not involve intermediate steps that require training of model parameters and is thus computationally less expensive.",
                "Our stain normalization system architecture is based on an optimized multi-core implementation that integrates multiple system-level optimizations (14)1. With this architecture we address two challenges of the stain normalization algorithm: (1) long processing time, and (2) large system memory consumption, when normalizing high-resolution images. Typical implementations of stain normalization algorithms cannot process high-resolution images, such as 40X resolution of a 160 k \u00d7 80 k WSI corresponding to 37.5 GB of data, on typical servers with less than 64 GB of RAM. Our implementation enables the processing of such images and can be used with different image formats, such as .svs, .tif, .ndpi, etc. This allows us to evaluate the performance of our stain normalization system on datasets generated by different scanners, e.g., Ventana, Hamamatsu, Aperio, Philips.",
                "Furthermore, we show that the stain normalization algorithm under study is sensitive to the quality of the input images. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new method to detect the poor-quality images and design a variant of the algorithm that is robust to such images. For the rest of the paper, we will refer to an image as having poor quality, when that image contains artifacts, e.g., stain spots, dirt etc. Finally, we show that our new normalization method can increase the accuracy of machine learning (ML) pipelines that use stain-normalized images as input. As an exemplary ML pipeline, we used a Tensorflow-based convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects tumor in prostate biopsy WSIs. Figure 1 shows a top-level overview of the ML-based pipeline used in this paper. Before feeding the ML engine with histological WSIs, we normalize the full image in a user pre-defined resolution, e.g., 10X. The normalized images can be stored to disk or directly pipelined with the ML engine. Then, the latter trains a CNN model using patches from the normalized WSI. The trained model is then used for inference to predict the presence of tumor in images.",
                "This paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we describe the datasets used in our study. In section 3.1 we describe the stain normalization algorithm employed in this study and re-emphasize the motivation of this work. In section 3.2 we present a high-performance version of the Macenko normalization algorithm that not only speeds up the execution time, but also enables the normalization of large whole-slide images, e.g., in 40X resolution, on off-the-shelf servers with less than 64 GB of RAM. In section 3.3, we show how sensitive the normalization algorithm under study can be to input images of poor quality, e.g., containing artifacts, spots of ink, dirt etc. We continue the section with depicting a method that detects such images and normalizes them using an algorithm variant which is robust to such input. Next, in section 3.4, we present the CNN architecture used to train models for detection of tumor in prostate biopsy whole-slide images. We summarize and discuss the results of the paper in sections 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, we conclude the paper in section 6."

                        "We use all datasets to analyze the performance, i.e., the run-time, speedup, and scalability, of our stain normalization system. We show that our implementation not only accelerates the normalization pre-processing, but it also supports different whole-slide image formats. In particular, the .ndpi/Hamamatsu format is not yet supported by standard open-source software for large-scale image analysis, such as the OpenSlide library (17). We included in our performance analysis the latter dataset to show the flexibility of our normalization system to load and process different image formats.",
                        "To evaluate the impact of stain normalization on the accuracy of ML-based medical pipelines and to assess the robustness of our enhanced normalization method to poor-quality images, we used only one of the proprietary datasets. More specifically, we used the prostate biopsy dataset, as it contains poor-quality images, which is not the case for the publicly available datasets. Thus, we can train and test a neural network model using a reasonably large number of such images. This dataset is the main focus regarding the new robust method presented in section 3.3, because it allowed us to identify shortcomings of the stain normalization algorithm and motivated us to design an enhanced normalization method which is robust to poor-quality images.",
                        "The prostate biopsy dataset contains 96 WSIs with tumor regions annotated by two pathologists. The annotations include Gleason scores: non-tumor, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3, 4+4, and 4+5. Modeling this problem as a multi-class classification is not appropriate in our case for several reasons. The distribution of samples across the Gleason scores is imbalanced. Although there are ways to compensate for class imbalance, in this particular case, some classes have so few examples that training on them would not be meaningful. Moreover, at Gleason score granularity, the class patterns overlap heavily, and it is hard to discriminate between classes, e.g., 3+3 and 3+4 or 4+3 and 4+4. Modeling the problem as a binary classification task mitigates these issues and still provides a useful categorization between healthy and tumorous samples. The regions with a Gleason score higher than or equal to 3+3 are considered as tumor and the remaining as non-tumor. Modeling this problem as a binary classification task has also been widely used by the scientific community (18, 19)."

                        "The stain normalization (SN) method presented in Macenko et al. (7) belongs to the class of unsupervised normalization methods. The algorithm first estimates the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain vectors of the WSI of interest by using a singular value decomposition (SVD) approach applied to the non-background pixels of the input image. Second, the algorithm applies a correction to account for the intensity variations due to the original strength of the stain, staining procedure etc. Finally, the image is projected to a reference image such that after stain normalization all normalized images have similar color characteristics. The algorithm is based on the principle that the color of each pixel (RGB channels) is a linear combination of the two H&E stain vectors which are unknown and need to be estimated. A reference MATLAB implementation of the Macenko algorithm is publicly available in (20). We outline the algorithmic steps of the Macenko normalization method in Algorithm 1. Most of the processing steps are applied to the RGB color vectors converted to optical density (OD) domain. Each RGB vector I with the color components normalized to [0,1] is transformed as follows OD = \u2212log10(I). This transformation provides a space where a linear combination of stains results in a linear combination of OD values.",
                        "In Figure 2 we show how stain normalization reduces the stain variability across images within and across different datasets. As a reference image, we have used the H&E vectors and maximum concentration values reported as a template in (20). We use the same reference image for the rest of the paper. To generate these normalized images we have used an optimized implementation of Algorithm 1, that we will describe in detail in section 3.2. We show original and normalized patches extracted from WSIs that belong to the two proprietary datasets described in section 2 and generated by different scanners A and B.",
                        "Previous state-of-the-art studies such as Ciompi et al. (21) demonstrated that the classification accuracy of a machine learning-based histopathology system is improved when using stain-normalized images. Other machine learning-based systems that use stain-normalized histopathology images have been proposed in the past. Zerhouni et al. (4) introduce an ML architecture for mitosis detection in breast histopathology WSIs. The approach uses stain-normalized patches of the original image in 40X resolution to train a Wide Residual Network. Ciresan et al. (22) propose an ML-based pipeline also for mitosis detection in breast histopathology images. The study uses H&E-stained WSIs split into patches that feed the training engine of an 11-layer CNN model. Litjens et al. (19) describe an ML pipeline for the detection of prostate cancer in H&E-stained whole-slide biopsy specimens. In general, stain normalization helps significantly to reduce the variability between whole-slide images, especially when they come from different hospitals or laboratories. When the variability between images is small, e.g., when they belong to the same dataset from the same clinic, stain normalization may have small impact on the ML pipeline, as was also shown in Lafarge et al. (23).",
                        "In Figure 3, we show the prediction accuracy of an ML pipeline with and without applying stain normalization to the input images. For these experiments we have used images from one of the proprietary datasets described in section 2 where the images show variability. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with non-normalized images (SN: no) and with normalized images (SN: fast_sn) and we plot the loss (Figure 3A) and F1 score (Figure 3B) on a validation dataset at different training epochs. We describe the CNN architecture in detail in section 3.4. The results depicted in Figure 3 show that after the same number of epochs, i.e., 430, training on stain-normalized images leads to a 35% lower validation loss and to an improvement in F1 score of 11 percentage points. We have also evaluated the generalization strength of the two trained CNN models on an unseen (test) dataset: normalizing the input whole-slide images improves the F1 score by 5 percentage points, from 0.74 (without normalization) to 0.79 (with normalization)."

A direct porting of this implementation to C++ suffers from memory and run-time bottlenecks, especially when trying to process 40X images. For example, the implementation fails to run on systems with 64 GB of RAM on 40X WSIs. Even when increasing the RAM capacity, it suffers from long processing time (>16 min per image on an 8-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3) for 40X images. The reason behind these issues is the lack of a system-aware implementation that uses the multi-core processors and the memory of the running system in an efficient way to allow fast loading and processing of the WSIs. For the rest of the paper, we will denote this C++ reference implementation by reference. In this section we present the steps we have taken to build an optimized stain normalization implementation that addresses the drawbacks of the reference implementation. We will refer to this optimized Macenko method implementation as fast_sn.",

(14). This first processing step automatically calculates the threshold based on which the pixels with low optical density are removed in Step 2 of Algorithm 1. In the original Macenko method, these pixels are removed based on an empirically-defined value which is common for all WSIs in a dataset. However, due to the intra-dataset color and intensity variability, a unique threshold is usually not recommended, as for some images the algorithm might remove too few or too many pixels and the robust extremes from Steps 6 and 11 in Algorithm 1 could be wrongly identified.",
                        "We propose to use an Otsu-based algorithm (24) to automatically identify the correct threshold for each individual image. To reduce the processing overhead, the block A in Figure 4 reads the input image in a low resolution, e.g., 2.5X, converts the pixels to gray-scale and applies Gaussian blur to further separate the maximum of the image intensity histograms. The optimal threshold is then extracted using Otsu thresholding. Both the Gaussian blur and the Otsu thresholding functions are integrated from the C/C++ opencv library.",
                        "Figure 5A shows an original image from one of the datasets described in section 2. In Figure 5B we display its corresponding image after applying Otsu thresholding. We further extract the Otsu-detected thresholds for a set of images from the same dataset and we plot them in Figure 5C. The background threshold value is a number between 0 and 255. As we can see in Figure 5C, even though the images belong to the same dataset they can have very different thresholds for filtering the pixels with low optical density. This parameter may therefore significantly affect the output of the SN algorithm. Our proposed automated detection step in Figure 4 ensures the determination of an accurate parameter value for each image.",
                        "Next, we present a set of implementation optimizations to decrease the run-time and memory footprint of the Macenko algorithm. The processing blocks B, C, and D in Figure 4 correspond to the optical density matrix (ODM (5)) calculation, the computation of stain concentrations and their robust maximum values, and the pixel normalization after transformation back to RGB space, respectively. Our implementation follows the steps shown in Algorithm 1. Due to multiple optimizations, we reorganize the steps of the original Macenko algorithm as shown in Figure 4.",
                        "(a) After image loading, only the RGB pixel values are stored in CPU memory. Since stain normalization is typically performed in the optical density (OD) domain, the conversion from RGB to OD in the various processing blocks B, C, and D is performed on the non-background pixels only. A look-up table method is used for the conversion from RGB to OD space instead of the log function in order to speed up the logarithmic computation.",
                        "(b) In block B, the covariance matrix in Step 3 of Algorithm 1 is calculated using the property that the element (i, j) of the matrix, \\(\\Sigma_{ij} = \\frac{1}{N^{2}}{({\\sum\\limits_{p}x_{p,i}x_{p,j} - \\sum\\limits_{p}x_{p,i}\\sum\\limits_{p}x_{p,j}})}\\) , requires only the sums of OD components.",
                        "(c) In blocks B and C, which are benchmarked as the most time-consuming steps, we use partial sorting to find the percentiles from Steps 6 and 10 in Algorithm 1. This partial sorting runs 3-4x faster compared to full sorting for our data.",
                        "(d) For the exponential function in processing block D, we use the fast exponentiation library (25) since it performs 5-10x faster compared to the corresponding function in the standard C library.",
                        "(e) Since processing blocks B-D perform many independent operations on individual pixels, their execution is parallelized across all available CPU threads using the OpenMP library (26).",
                        "(f) Given that processing blocks B and C are the most time-consuming due to the inherent difficulty of parallelizing the sorting operations, we propose a further optimization that is based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique (27). In this method, a sample of non-background pixels is randomly chosen from the set of all non-background pixels in order to estimate the required robust extremes from Steps 6 and 10. Even though there are different methods for estimating the population percentiles (28), an analytical estimation of the required sample size is difficult (29). Therefore, we derive the optimal sample size based on empirical experimental results. A good sampling rate that we use in this paper is 1%. This rate was found by computing the Euclidean distance of the OD matrix and the relative error of the robust maximum of the individual stain concentrations (max Ch and max Ce) between the sampling (with different sampling rates) and no-sampling results (14)."

In this section we address yet another challenge of this normalization method. We show that the Macenko algorithm may fail to estimate the correct H&E vectors when the quality of the input image is poor, e.g., the image contains artifacts and/or impurities, such as staining spots, dirt, etc. In such cases, the estimated H&E vectors may not be accurate and may be biased toward a specific color (e.g., blue or pink). Such normalization results may adversely impact the accuracy of a machine learning pipeline that uses as input normalized whole-slide images. We demonstrate examples of such cases in section 4.",

Figures 6B,E depict selected patches from their corresponding normalized images. We can see that these normalized patches are not projected to a common color space as expected. These results show that the Macenko algorithm does not work in the presence of artifacts in the input image. This is due to the algorithm taking artifact pixels into account while calculating the H&E vectors.",
                        "A conventional method to identify the presence of artifacts in an image is to divide it into patches, and then analyze each patch in order to detect the presence of artifacts, e.g., by examining the color, intensity, or other features of the image. For example, Vahadane et al. (30) describe a method of dividing the image into patches which are then filtered based on a luminosity threshold for background. Only the remaining patches are used for the estimation of the stain vectors. Such a method however increases the complexity and latency of medical pipelines. We propose a less complex method to detect the cases of problematic H&E estimation for input images. For the rest of the paper, we will refer to this method as fast_rsn. Figure 7 gives an overview of our proposed method.",

We run fast_sn without the last normalization step, as we only need the estimated H&E vectors and maximum Ch and Ce concentrations. Next, we assess the quality of these values, assuming that poor-quality images have values that deviate from those estimated from good-quality images. By removing images that are assessed to be of poor quality we create a subset of good-quality images. If the image is detected as poor-quality, then the method replaces its estimated parameters with average estimates of the subset of the good-quality images in the same dataset. The image is then normalized using Step 11 in Algorithm 1. Two main components of this proposed method are: (1) detecting the poor-quality images (there is no a-priori knowledge about which images have artifacts and which not), and (2) finding a representative set of H&E and maximum Ch and Ce values. Figure 8 illustrates how the two components work in this paper.",

In addition, we extract the estimated maximum Ch and Ce stain concentration values (Figures 8D,H). We define acceptable ranges for the values of each H&E channel and maximum Ch and Ce. Figure 8A shows an example of such a range defined by a lower bound and an upper bound. A value that falls outside its respective range is considered an outlier and any image that has at least one outlier value is considered of poor quality. Otherwise, the image is a good-quality WSI. Once we identify the poor-quality WSIs, we normalize them by using a representative set of H&E vector values and maximum Ch and Ce stain concentration values. This representative set is derived from the values of the good-quality images from the same dataset, by taking the mean of HR, HG, HB, ER, EG, EB, maximum Ch and maximum Ce, respectively.",
                        "Figures 6C,F show the patches in Figures 6B,E but normalized using the new fast_rsn method. We can already visually notice that fast_rsn projects the images to a more common color space than fast_sn. Moreover, the original images containing the red and blue artifacts (Figures 6A,D) are correctly identified by our new normalization method as poor-quality images as they show up as outliers in Figure 8. For example, Figures 6A,D correspond to the red and blue outliers marked in Figures 8F,H, respectively.",
                        "Another variant of the robust normalization method depicted above is the following. Similarly to the fast_rsn method, we first detect the good-quality images and compute the representative set of the H&E and maximum Ch and Ce stain concentration parameters, as described above. Then, instead of replacing the values of the critical parameters only for the outliers (the poor-quality images), we replace them for all images. This method can further reduce the runtime of the stain normalization algorithm and could help in using a more uniform set of stain vectors for normalization across WSIs from the same dataset. We denote this second method by fast_rsn_all.",

This is different from other methods that use color deconvolution with fixed H&E vectors. For example, the main differences when compared to Ruifrok et al. (5) are: (1) our method does not use an arbitrary set of fixed H&E vectors but a set of representative vectors that have been estimated and updated for each dataset and, thus, they are characteristic of the dataset and not agnostic to it, and (2) the set of representative vectors is coming from the same dataset as the input image."

Therefore, we process the WSIs for the tumor detection task in a patch-wise manner. We choose to extract patches from resolution 10X, because 10X contains biological information, such as shape and structure of glands, and arrangement of cells around glands, which are important features for tumor detection. First, we fully normalize the 10X images. We use 70% of the images for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing. Each patient's biopsies are in a single WSI and this WSI is assigned to exactly one of the train/validation/test partitions to make the testing scenario as realistic as possible (we do not assess the accuracy of our CNN model on data used for training). After normalization, we split the 10X images into patches. The average tumor content in a WSI of our dataset is 5%, thus in order to deal with such a class imbalance, we start extracting patches from the full 10X image using a stride of 512 and reduce it to a stride of 10 when we identify a patch with tumor tissue. The stride is restored to 512 when a patch without tumor region is identified. These stride values ensured a good tumor/non-tumor class balance for our dataset."

When using pixel sampling, it is important to define metrics that quantify the impact of using only a part of the available pixels on the quality of the normalization. In our work, we used the Euclidean distance of the H&E vectors and the relative error of the robust maximum of the individual stain concentrations (max Ch and max Ce) between the sampling (with different sampling rates) and no-sampling results (14).",

In the case of poor-quality images, these parameters are replaced with the average parameter values of the good-quality images from the same dataset. As shown in section 4, such a method can significantly increase the accuracy of ML pipelines. Other color-based normalization algorithms may have similar or other critical parameters.

Moreover, it can be used with different whole-slide image formats, generated by scanners such as Ventana, Aperio, Philips, or Hamamatsu, and it can be easily extended to other whole-slide image formats. Such a system enables the pre-processing of large datasets, which is a critical pre-requisite for any machine learning framework applied to biomedical images.",
