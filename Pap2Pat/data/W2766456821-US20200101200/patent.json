The mammal is not particularly limited, but is preferably a human. ES cells in passage culture can be maintained using a culture solution containing substances, such as a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and/or a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). ES cells can be selected, for example, using expression of gene markers, such as OCT-3/4, NANOG, and ECAD, as an indication.",

These cells can be induced to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages like ES cells. GS cells can be self-renewed in a culture solution containing a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Repeated passage under the same conditions as those for ES cells produces sperm stem cells (M. Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2003) Biol. Reprod., 69: 612-616).",

In an embodiment, glucose can be added to the medium. The glucose concentration of the medium can be adjusted to 2.0 g/L or less, or 0.1 to 1.0 g/L. In an embodiment, it is preferable to add to the medium a growth factor such as a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), an epidermal growth factor (EGF), recombinant EGF (rEGF), insulin and/or fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Of these factors, a single factor or a combination of two or more factors may be added to the medium. The concentration of the growth factor(s) in the medium is typically 1 to 100 ng/mL, and preferably 2 to 5 ng/mL. From the standpoint of efficient culture of corneal endothelial cells, it is preferable to add a 5 to 1,000 \u03bcg/mL ascorbic acid derivative, such as ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, to the medium. In addition, the pH and temperature of the medium, the culture container, etc., may be as described above. The time period for culture is not particularly limited, and, for example, cells can be cultured until the stage at which the cells become confluent (steady state) (e.g., 1 to 5 days).

A usable medium is a DME medium containing 15% fetal calf serum (FCS) and a 2 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

When the cell population cultured under conditions suitable for inducing differentiation into corneal endothelial cells is in a monolayer state, the cell population can be brought into a suspended state according to a conventional method. A suspended cell population can be obtained, for example, by suspending a cell population using a proteolytic enzyme (e.g., trypsin) and/or a chelating agent for destroying cell-cell adhesion molecules.

Therefore, corneal endothelial cells, or a cell population suitable for transplantation into the cornea, can be obtained using the expression of these genes as an indication. Further, the expression of these genes can be used as an indication to determine whether the cell population is suitable for transplantation into the cornea. That is, if these genes are expressed in the cell population, it can be determined that the cell population is suitable for transplantation into the cornea; and if these genes are not expressed, it can be determined that the cell population is not suitable for transplantation into the cornea. Moreover, POU6F2 is expressed at high levels in relatively mature corneal endothelial cells. Therefore, relatively mature corneal endothelial cells, or a cell population suitable for transplantation into the cornea, can be obtained using the expression or expression levels of POU6F2 as an indication.",

In an embodiment, the expression level of the gene in the cell population is preferably equal to or higher than a predetermined reference value. The reference value can be determined in any manner from the viewpoint of being suitable for transplantation into the cornea. For example, the reference value can be set equal to or higher than the expression level of the gene in in vivo corneal endothelial cells and/or cultured corneal endothelium.",

Then, using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc.), total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol, and Heliscope CAGE libraries were prepared for three samples (Kanamori-Katayama M, et al. (2011), Genome Res. 21: 1150-1159). Then, sequencing was performed by SeqLL (Boston, Mass.) using the HeliScope\u2122 Single Molecule Sequencer (Helicos BioSciences Corp., Cambridge, Mass.).",
                                "The Descemet's membrane isolated as described above was incubated in StemPro Accutase (Thermo Fisher) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and corneal endothelial cells were isolated from the Descemet's membrane. The isolated corneal endothelial cells were gently centrifuged and collected, and then suspended in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, Ohio), and 2 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Invitrogen). The cells were seeded on dishes coated with a cell attachment reagent (FNC coating mix; Athena ES, Baltimore, Md.), and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Total RNA was then extracted using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All the cells used for RNA extraction were those harvested during the first passage. For this as well, Heliscope CAGE libraries were prepared for two samples. Then, sequencing was performed by SeqLL (Boston, Mass.) using HeliScopeT Single Molecule Sequencer (Helicos BioSciences Corp., Cambridge, Mass.).",

Further, the number of tags mapped to 184,827 promoter regions identified in the FANTOM5 project was counted. For the in vivo corneal endothelium, the expression level was compared with the data of 182 human tissue samples analyzed in FANTOM5, and for the cultured corneal endothelial cells, the expression level was compared with the data of 536 human cultured cell samples analyzed in FANTOM5. Each was corrected by the total number of mapped tags, and the expression level was calculated with tpm (tags per million) as the unit. Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR (Robinson, M.

As a reference for human transcription factors, a reference was made to http://fantomgsc.riken.jp/5/sstar/Browse_Transcription_Factors_hg19.",

It was confirmed that TFAP2B was most highly expressed in the in vivo corneal endothelium.",

The same level of expression as in the corneal endothelial cells was also observed in the trabecular meshwork cells. Further, expression in the corneal parenchymal cells was also confirmed. Since the corneal endothelium, corneal parenchyma, and trabecular meshwork are all periocular neural crest-derived tissues, these results suggest that LMX1B is expected to be applied not only as a corneal endothelial marker, but also as a marker for periocular neural crest-derived tissues.",
                                "FIG. 5 shows the expression levels of POU6F2 in human tissue samples.

The expression level in the cultured corneal endothelial cells was 100 tpm or more, whereas no expression was observed in 535 out of the 536 human cultured cell samples analyzed in FANTOM5.

                                "The expression of the above three genes was quantitatively analyzed in the corneal endothelium and other tissues. FIG. 7 shows the results of measuring expression in cells induced from iPS cells (iPS) (e.g., neural crest cells (iNC)) and intraocular tissues by quantitative PCR. As shown in FIG. 7, it was confirmed that POU6F2, LMX1B, and TFAP2B were highly expressed in the cultured corneal endothelial cells (HCEC), corneal endothelial precursor cells (HCEP), differentiation-induced corneal endothelial precursor cells (dHCEP), and in vivo corneal endothelium (Cendo). In contrast, POU6F2 was hardly expressed in the corneal stroma (CS), iris stroma (IS), ciliary body (CB), trabecular meshwork (TM), corneal limbal epithelium (Clim), central corneal epithelium (Cepi), corneal limbal fibroblasts (LF), conjunctival epithelium (Cj), lens (LN), iris epithelium (IE), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retina (Retina), and optic nerve (ON). LMX1B was also expressed in the trabecular meshwork, corneal parenchyma, and iris stroma, which were neural crest-derived tissues. TFAP2B was highly expressed in the iPS-derived neural crest cells. These results suggest that POU6F2, LMX1B, and TFAP2B are useful as markers for corneal endothelial cells.",

(2013), Hum Mol Genet 22: 1271-1279) in the human adult/fetal-derived corneal endothelium revealed no significant changes in the expression of TFAP2B and LMX1B; in contrast, the expression of POU6F2 was significantly higher in the adult-derived corneal endothelium (FIG. 8). This suggests that POU6F2 is expressed on the functional mature corneal endothelium and is related to terminal differentiation of the corneal endothelium. Therefore, POU6F2 is considered to be useful for the quality evaluation of corneal endothelial cell products, and also useful for the production of corneal endothelial cells because it is a transcription factor."
