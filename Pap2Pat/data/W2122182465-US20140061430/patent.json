                        "A solar concentrator battery system has a higher electricity generating efficiency than a conventional one, but requires a high accuracy sun tracking system to achieve the high efficiency. How accurate the sun tracking system is has a direct effect upon the electricity generating efficiency. A sun position sensor is a key element for tracking the sun position in the sun tracking system, and thus a very issue is focused on improvement of the accuracy of the sun position sensor in the industry.",
                        "However, the currently available sun position sensor, e.g. the one disclosed in TW patent I300465, still has the four issues: viewing angle, light intensity, sensitivity, and cost, and will be explained in the following.",

Thus, this issue has to be well addressed.",
                        "Light intensity: within the viewing angle of the sun position sensor, the light intensity is used as a basis for determining if the tracking action should be performed. For example, when the light intensity of sun is too weak, no electricity generation is possible and thus the tracking action is saved for cost saving.",

                        "Cost: since the cost issue has a direct effect on competitiveness of the solar energy electricity generating system, the key element of the sun position sensor plays the same role.",
                        "In a conventional sun position sensor, the characteristics of limited viewing angle, incapable recognition of light intensity, weak sensitivity and high cost are presented. And as a method for following sun is concerned, the former three characteristics issues are also encountered. For the currently available sun position sensor, although the three characteristics have been improved, the sensitivity issue still has to be overcome, forming a weak point in achieving a high accuracy of the sun position sensor since the light intensity of sun has been always the most important key for sensitivity.",
