    "abstract": "The invention relates to a method for producing functionalised monomers, the method comprising: a) providing a starting material selected from terpenes and terpenoids; b) forming a derivative of the starting material by incorporation of a hydroxyl group; c) esterifying the hydroxyl group of the derivative to introduce a moiety containing a vinyl group, so as to produce a functionalised monomer.

                        "Renewable polymers currently capture only a very small share (<5%) of the global polymers market, largely as a result of their perceived high cost and inferior performance compared with synthetic polymers produced from petroleum sources. However, plastics presently account for a global annual usage of more than 7% of fossil fuels and this will undoubtedly grow. Petroleum-derived products will in due course become obsolete and society now demands polymers that are derived from sustainable substitutes.",
                        "There is therefore a pressing need for bio-derived feedstocks to replace fossil fuels as the basis for the fine and commodity chemical industries, including the production of polymers. Biorenewable feedstocks are thought of as more environmentally friendly and sustainable by consumers, and can also be biodegradeable in some cases. This leads to manufacturers choosing bio-derived plastics over similar fossil fuel based plastics, provided the cost and quality of the polymer is not significantly different.",
                        "In the polymer sector, there is a clear desire for new technologies related to renewable (bio-derived) raw material and biological processes. These have advantages in terms of, for example, stronger industrial competitiveness, raw materials diversification, quicker routes to sustainability, an efficient and sustainable use of natural resources, and a rapid development of new consumer markets.",
                        "Any new monomers that are derived from (bio-derived) raw material should be able to be synthesised in an atom efficient manner, and should maximise their renewable component, thus ensuring take-up by industry. However, the polymers as derived from these materials must also offer good or improved performance as compared with synthetic polymers if they are to find a place in the market.",
                        "Terpenes and terpenoids are known in the art as naturally occurring materials. They are naturally abundant from plant sources and they are also available as waste products from the wood and citrus juice industries.",
                        "Most terpenes have a basic cycloaliphatic structure with an isoprene elementary unit (2-methyl-1,4-butadiene). Terpenoids can be considered as modified terpenes, wherein methyl groups have been moved or removed, or oxygen atoms added.",
                        "Terpenes and terpenoids are molecules that arise from biomass, particularly from plants and coniferous trees and are currently available in significant volumes from forestry waste streams. For example, turpentine (\u02dc350 kt per annum) is steadily rising in production volumes. \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-pinene account for 45-90% and 1-30% of the total turpentine composition respectively (depending on the kind of tree and geographical area)",
                        "D-limonene is currently derived from citrus and coniferous sources for aroma, flavour and pharmaceutical application and is produced at \u02dc75 kt per annum. Globally, \u02dc88 Mt per annum of citrus fruit material is used to produce juice and foods (e.g. marmalade) and half of this ends up as citrus waste. While a small portion of this waste is dried and used as animal feed, this is typically not economically viable and a large fraction is simply sent to waste disposal facilities or dumped into the ocean.",
                        "Carvone is a naturally occurring terpenoid, being found in both Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Carum carvi (caraway) oils. However, most of the carvone used in industry is synthesised from limonene.",
                        "The four most commercially available products from the group of terpenes and terpenoids are:",
                        "A wide range of methodologies have been applied to polymerise terpenes and have been reviewed extensively. See, for example, M. O. Carmody et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 59, 1312 (1937); A. Gandini, Macromolecules 41, 9491 (2008); P. A. Wilbon et al., Macromol. Rapid Commun. 34, 8 (2013); and K. J. Yao et al., Macromolecules 46, 1689 (2013).",
                        "The range of polymers that can be formed via cationic polymerisation appears very limited. Amongst the few successes, \u03b2-pinene has been shown to polymerise via cationic routes and can form some co-polymers. In order to avoid side reactions, reach high conversions and obtain poly(\u03b2-pinene) with high Mn (40,000 g/mol) very low temperatures are required (\u221240 to \u221280\u00b0 C.), however. Thus the conditions required to achieve high yield and good control are not ones that can be easily reproduced on the commercial scale.",
                        "Direct polymerisation has in theory seemed a viable opportunity, because many of the terpene and terpenoid structures have unsaturated moieties. However, extensive studies have demonstrated that their reactivities are extremely low and they simply do not polymerise well with free radical initiators. They do not homopolymerise, and even in the presence of a co-monomer (such as styrene or an acrylate) the level of incorporation of \u03b2-pinene or d-limonene is minimal and the polymers have only very low molecular weights. See A. Gandini, Macromolecules 41, 9491 (2008).",
                        "Recently, ruthenium catalysed ring opening metathesis has been utilised to polymerise just two natural sesquiterpenes, caryophyllene and humulene\u2014see E. Grau et al., Green Chemistry 15, 1112 (2013). The polymers have glass transition temperatures in the range from \u221215 to \u221250\u00b0 C. The methodology cannot, however, be applied to the most readily available terpenes.",
                        "Others have taken different approaches and have modified the terpene structures to create more reactive monomers. For example, a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation has been used to create lactone monomers from menthone and carvone; these could then be polymerised via ring-opening using a Zn catalyst to yield new polymers and copolymers with glass transition temperatures in the range of \u221220 to \u221227\u00b0 C. See J. R. Lowe et al., Polymer Chemistry 2, 702 (2011). A key attraction of these materials was that they are, in principle, biodegradable. However their low glass transition temperatures preclude most applications requiring mechanical strength.",
                        "In a different approach, careful oxidation of limonene was used to create epoxides that could react with CO2 to form poly(carbonates) in a reaction catalysed by \u03b2-diiminate zinc acetate complexes to yield polymer with controlled molecular weight and a glass transition temperature of around 100\u00b0 C. See C. M. Byrne et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 11404 (2004).",
                        "Though promising, both of these examples are limited in the range of polymers that can be achieved and it is difficult to envisage simple commercial routes by which controlled block copolymer structures could be created.",
                        "In summary, there is an unmet need for polymers that are obtained from polymerising monomers which are bio-derived materials, especially such polymers that can be obtained via a commercially viable and flexible polymerisation route."

These polymers are formed from terpenes and terpenoids, which can be obtained from a number of sustainable sources, including tree resin, waste citrus peel or through fermentation. This new technology improves upon the known approaches for making terpene-based polymers, giving products with more desirable properties.",

                        "This opens up opportunities for the terpene derived polymer to be used in a variety of applications where existing bio-derived polymers are unsuitable. Two specific example are: plastic cups, where the good thermomechanical stability of the bio-derived polymer is important; and polymer coatings, where the double bonds in the terpenes allow for curing of the coating to enable it to be stabilised. For example, when considering medical applications it is important that coatings as provided on surgical instruments have high thermomechanical stability, so that the instruments can be sterilised at high temperature, e.g. in an autoclave. Clearly, the present invention is not limited to such end uses, but they are examples of where the ability to produce polymers with high Tg values is important.",
                        "Meanwhile, the benefits of terpenes and terpenoids as starting materials are retained, in that they are renewable natural feedstocks which are abundant and relatively low cost.",

                        "This step may be carried out with a reducing agent, e.g. with lithium aluminium hydride or with diisobutylaluminium hydride. Sodium borohydride may also be considered.",
                        "The reduction may be carried out in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. THF, MeTHF, diethyl ether, toluene or hexane. The skilled person will appreciate that for reduction with diisobutylaluminium hydride a polar organic solvent such as THF should be used.",

                        "This route therefore involves the use of borane (BH3) to form an organoborane and then transformation to an alcohol by treatment with basic hydrogen peroxide. This is described in, for example, H. C. Brown, B. S. Subba Rao, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959, 81, 6423.",

                        "In the oxidation stage, the hydrogen peroxide may be used together with any suitable base to provide the required basic conditions. For example, sodium hydroxide may be used or potassium hydroxide may be used.",
                        "The treatment with basic hydrogen peroxide is carried out in aqueous solution.",

Indeed preferably, step b) is not carried out and the terpenoid that already includes a hydroxyl group is used directly in step c). However, it will be appreciated that as long as the material has a hydroxyl group when step c) is effected, in theory the skilled person could choose to modify the terpenoid starting material\u2014and this is not precluded from the invention.",

All reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware under Ar atmosphere. THF was distilled from Na/benzophenone immediately prior to use. DCM was dried over 4 \u212b molecular sieves prior to use. Methyl-tetrahydrofuran was purchased from Aldrich over 4 \u212b molecular sieves. Column chromatography was carried out either manually on silica gel Fluka 60 or on a Biotage\u00ae SP4 using Biotage\u00ae SNAP KP-Sil cartridges and petroleum ether (40-60\u00b0 C.)/ethyl acetate as eluent, whilst monitoring by UV (254 nm) and thin layer chromatography (PMA stain). All NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3 at room temperature using Bruker\u00ae DPX300, Bruker\u00ae AV400 spectrometers for which chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to the solvent and coupling constants are expressed in Hz. Infrared spectroscopic data were recorded using a Bruker\u00ae Tensor27 FTIR spectrometer. Mass spectral data (and HRMS) were obtained using a Bruker\u00ae MicroTOF spectrometer. Optical rotations were measured on an ADP440 Polarimeter. Melting points were measured on a Gallenkamp\u00ae apparatus.",

After that time, keeping the solution at 0\u00b0 C., solvent and an oxidising agent system were added subsequently in a drop wise manner. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour warming to room temperature and additionally two hours at 80\u00b0 C. The reaction was then allowed to cool before quenching by addition of a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl. Aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (3\u00d7).
