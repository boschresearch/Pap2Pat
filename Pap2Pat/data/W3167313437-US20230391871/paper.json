    "title": "Targeting monoamine oxidase A-regulated tumor-associated macrophage polarization for cancer immunotherapy",
    "date": "2021-06-10",
    "abstract": "Targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising strategy to modify the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve cancer immunotherapy. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an enzyme best known for its function in the brain; small molecule MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are clinically used for treating neurological disorders. Here we observe MAO-A induction in mouse and human TAMs. MAO-A-deficient mice exhibit decreased TAM immunosuppressive functions corresponding with enhanced antitumor immunity. MAOI treatment induces TAM reprogramming and suppresses tumor growth in preclinical mouse syngeneic and human xenograft tumor models. Combining MAOI and anti-PD-1 treatments results in synergistic tumor suppression. Clinical data correlation studies associate high intratumoral MAOA expression with poor patient survival in a broad range of cancers. We further demonstrate that MAO-A promotes TAM immunosuppressive polarization via upregulating oxidative stress. Together, these data identify MAO-A as a critical regulator of TAMs and support repurposing MAOIs for TAM reprogramming to improve cancer immunotherapy.",

                "Over the past decade, cancer immunotherapy has achieved significant breakthroughs. In particular, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has yielded remarkable clinical responses and revolutionised the treatment of many cancers1. So far, the FDA has approved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) blockade therapies for treating more than ten different malignancies2; however, only a small fraction of cancer patients respond to these therapies3,4. Most ICB therapies work through enhancing antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses, which can be greatly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)5. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the immunosuppressive TME, dampen T-cell antitumor reactivity in the majority of solid tumors6\u20139. Growing evidence suggests that TAMs are responsible for inhibiting antitumor T-cell reactivity and limiting the ICB therapy efficacy, making TAMs potential targets for reversing the immunosuppressive TME and improving cancer immunotherapy10\u201312.",
                "In general, TAMs are considered to mature from bone marrow-derived circulating monocytes; these monocytes are recruited to the tumor sites, exposed to chemokines and growth factors in the TME, and subsequently differentiate into TAMs13,14. There is also increasing evidence for tissue-resident macrophage-originated TAMs15. Depending on the surrounding immune environment, macrophages can be polarized towards an immunostimulatory phenotype by pro-inflammatory stimuli (e.g., IFN-\u03b3) or towards an immunosuppressive phenotype by anti-inflammatory stimuli (e.g., IL-4 and IL-13)16. Although a binary polarization system is commonly used in macrophage studies, in most large-scale transcriptome analyses, TAMs showed a continuum of phenotypes expressing both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive markers in addition to the extreme ends of polarization16,17. These mixed phenotypes and polarization states suggest the complexity of the TME and the residential TAM functionality. As a tumor develops, the enrichment of IL-4 and IL-13 produced by tumor cells and CD4+ T cells in the TME results in the polarization of TAMs towards an immunosuppressive phenotype, that promotes tumor growth, malignancy, and metastasis16,18. In established solid tumors, TAMs predominately exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype, evidenced by their production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and arginase-1 (Arg1), as well as their expression of mannose receptor (CD206) and scavenger receptors19,20. Through metabolising l-arginine via Arg1, TAMs can directly suppress cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses21,22. Mannose receptor (CD206) expressed by TAMs can impair cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells by suppressing CD45 phosphatase activity23. In addition, TAMs can inhibit T-cell activities through immune checkpoint engagement by expressing the ligands of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4. For example, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on TAMs interact with PD-1 of T cells to directly inhibit TCR signalling, cytotoxic function, and proliferation of CD8+ T cells19. These characteristics of TAMs make them potential targets for reversing the immunosuppressive TME to augment antitumor immunity.",
                "Although the predominant phenotype of TAMs in established solid tumors is immunosuppressive, polarization is not fixed. Plasticity, one of the key features of TAMs, enables TAMs to change their phenotype in solid tumors and thereby providing a therapeutic window24,25. Repolarizing/reprogramming TAMs from an immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotype towards an immunostimulatory and tumoricidal phenotype has thus become an attractive strategy in immunotherapy18. Preclinical and clinical studies are ongoing, evaluating TAM-repolarizing reagents (e.g., CD40 agonists, HDAC inhibitors, PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors, creatine, etc.) for improving ICB therapy; certain efficacies have been reported11,19,26. Therefore, the search for new molecules regulating TAM polarization and the development of new combination treatments targeting TAM reprogramming is an active direction of current cancer immunotherapy studies.",
                "Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an outer mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme encoded by the X-linked MAOA gene. MAO-A is best known for its function in the brain, where it is involved in the degradation of a variety of monoamine neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Through regulating the availability of serotonin, MAO-A modulates neuronal activities thereby influencing mood and behaviour in humans27,28. Through regulating the availability of dopamine and the abundance of dopamine breakdown by-product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; hence oxidative stress), MAO-A is involved in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD)29,30. FDA-approved small-molecule MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are currently available for the treatment of neurological disorders, including depression and PD30\u201332. However, the functions of MAO-A outside of the brain are largely unknown.",
                "In this study, we investigate the role of MAO-A in regulating TAM polarization and evaluate the possibility of repurposing MAOIs for reprogramming TAMs and improving cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate that MAO-A promotes TAM immunosuppressive polarization and subsequent inhibition of antitumor immunity in mice via upregulating oxidative stress. MAOI treatment induces TAM reprogramming and suppresses tumor progression in preclinical mouse syngeneic and human xenograft tumor models. Combining MAOI and anti-PD-1 treatments result in synergistic tumor suppression. Clinical data correlation studies associate high intratumoral MAO-A expression with poor patient survival in a broad range of cancers. Together, these data identify MAO-A as a critical regulator of TAMs and support repurposing MAOIs for TAM reprogramming to improve cancer immunotherapy."

In addition to changes in classical genes involved in regulating macrophage immune responses, we observed the induction of a Maoa gene in TAMs (Fig.\u00a01a), suggesting that MAO-A may be involved in modulating TAM activities.Fig. 1MAO-A-deficient mice show reduced tumor growth associated with altered TAM polarization.a QPCR analyses of Maoa mRNA expression in TAMs isolated from wild-type mice-bearing B16-OVA tumors.

                        "To study the role of MAO-A in antitumor immunity in vivo, we used MAO-A-deficient mice that carry a hypomorphic MAO-A mutant33. Although a degree of Maoa expression leakage in the brain had been previously reported in these mice33, analysis of their immune system showed nearly complete ablation of MAO-A expression in major lymphoid organs, including the spleen and bone marrow (BM) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). Since we focused on immune cells in this study, we denote these mice as Maoa knockout (KO) mice. When challenged with B16-OVA melanoma cells (Fig.\u00a01b), tumor growth in Maoa KO mice was significantly suppressed compared to that in Maoa wild-type (WT) mice (Fig.\u00a01c, d). Although similar levels of TAMs (gated as CD45.2+CD11b+Ly6G\u2212Ly6C\u2212/lowF4/80+ cells) were detected in Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b, c), compared to their WT counterparts, TAMs isolated from Maoa KO mice exhibited a less immunosuppressive phenotype, indicated by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206; Fig.\u00a01e), and their increased expression of immunostimulatory molecules (i.e., CD69, CD86 and MHC class II I-Ab; Fig.\u00a01f\u2013h). Further analysis showed that TAMs from Maoa KO mice expressed reduced levels of immunosuppression-associated genes (i.e., Mrc1, Chi3l3 and Arg1; Fig.\u00a01i) and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (i.e., Il6, Tnf\u03b1 and Ccl2; Fig.\u00a01j). Corresponding to the altered TAM polarization in Maoa KO mice, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in these mice showed enhanced activation (i.e., increased production of Granzyme B; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis was performed on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIs) isolated from Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of total TIIs showed the formation of 6 cell clusters (TAM/Mono, T cell, NK cell, B cell, DC and pDC; Fig.\u00a01k and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e); cell cluster distributions were similar comparing Maoa WT and KO TIIs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f, g). Further UMAP analysis of the TAM/Mono subpopulation showed the formation of five cell clusters (TAM_1, TAM_2, Mono_1, Mono_2 and Mono_3; Fig.\u00a01k and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01h). Compared to that in Maoa WT mice, the TAM subpopulation in Maoa KO mice comprised an increased ratio of TAM_1 (Mrc1lowCd86high) to TAM_2 (Mrc1highCd86low) cells, corresponding to a reduced immunosuppressive phenotype of TAMs in Maoa KO mice (Fig.\u00a01l and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01i); the monocyte subpopulation in Maoa WT and KO mice comprised a similar composition of Mono_1 (Ly6c2med), Mono_2 (Ly6c2lo), and Mono_3 (Ly6c2hi) cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01j, k). Gene expression profile analysis confirmed a reduction of TAMs expressing immunosuppressive genes (i.e., Mrc1 and Chi3I3; Fig.\u00a01m) and an enrichment of TAMs expressing immunostimulatory genes (i.e., Ccl2, Ccl7, Cd86, H2-Aa, and H2-Ab1; Fig.\u00a01n) in Maoa KO mice. These data strongly indicate that MAO-A is involved in regulating TAM polarization thereby modulating antitumor immunity."

In this experiment, MAO-A deficiency comparison was confined to immune cells. MAO-A deficiency in immune cells resulted in suppressed tumor growth (Fig.\u00a02b, c), altered TAM polarization (i.e., downregulation of immunosuppressive markers such as CD206, Fig.\u00a02d; and upregulation of immunostimulatory markers such as CD69, CD86 and MHC class II I-Ab; Fig.\u00a02e, f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a), and enhanced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cell activation (i.e., increased production of cytotoxic molecules such as Granzyme B; Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b), indicating that MAO-A directly regulates immune cell antitumor activity, in particular TAM polarization and T-cell antitumor reactivity.Fig. 2MAO-A directly regulates TAM polarization and influences TAM-associated antitumor T-cell reactivity.a\u2013f Studying B16-OVA tumor growth and TAM phenotype in BoyJ (CD45.1) wild-type mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells isolated from either Maoa WT or Maoa KO donor mice (denoted as WT or KO experimental mice, respectively). a Experimental design. b Tumor growth (***p\u2009<\u20090.001). c Tumor volume at day 24 (***p\u2009<\u20090.001). d\u2013f FACS analyses of CD206 (d) (**p\u2009=\u20090.0087), CD69 (e) (*p\u2009=\u20090.0349) and CD86 (*p\u2009=\u20090.0429). f Expression on TAMs at day 24.

We observed a sharp induction of Maoa mRNA expression in Maoa WT BMDMs during M-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation; Maoa expression was then plateaued in matured BMDMs and maintained over IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization (Fig.\u00a03b, c).

                        "Next, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating MAO-A promotion of macrophage immunosuppressive polarization. It has been reported that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS; hence, oxidative stress) elicit macrophage immunosuppressive features34\u201336. MAO-A catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamines, thereby generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product that can increase intracellular ROS levels. We, therefore, speculated that MAO-A might promote TAM immunosuppressive polarization in TME via upregulating ROS levels in TAMs (Fig.\u00a04a).Fig. 4MAO-A promotes macrophage immunosuppressive polarization via ROS upregulation.a Schematics showing MAO-A breaks down monoamines and generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a by-product, thereby increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in a TAM. b, c Studying the in vivo ROS levels in TAMs isolated from Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice-bearing B16-OVA tumors (n\u2009=\u20094). b Experimental design. c FACS analyses of ROS levels in TAMs at day 18.

                        "To test this hypothesis, we directly measured ROS levels in TAMs isolated from Maoa WT and KO mice-bearing B16-OVA tumors and detected significantly lower levels of ROS in Maoa KO TAMs (Fig.\u00a04b, c). Measurement of ROS levels in in vitro-cultured Maoa WT and KO BMDMs also showed reduced levels of ROS in Maoa KO BMDMs, with or without IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, in agreement with the in vivo TAM results (Fig.\u00a04d). Supplementing H2O2 to IL-4/IL-13-stimulated Maoa WT and KO BMDMs elevated their intracellular ROS to similar levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, b) and eliminated their differences in expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206; Fig.\u00a04e) and signature genes (i.e., Chi3l3 and Arg1; Fig.\u00a04f, g).",
                        "On the other hand, supplementation of tyramine, a substrate of MAO-A, increased ROS levels and upregulated the expression of immunosuppressive genes (i.e., Chi3l3 and Arg1) in Maoa WT BMDMs but not in Maoa KO BMDMs (Fig.\u00a04h\u2013j). Taken together, these data indicate that MAO-A regulates macrophage immunosuppressive polarization via modulating macrophage intracellular ROS levels.",
                        "The JAK-Stat6 signalling pathway plays a key role in mediating IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization of TAMs in TME37,38. After IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, JAK is phosphorylated and subsequently phosphorylates Stat6; phosphorylated Stat6 dimerises and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoters of IL-4 and IL-13 responsive genes including those involved in macrophage immunosuppressive functions39. ROS has been reported to promote JAK and Stat6 phosphorylation in a variety of cell types40,41. Since we observed decreased ROS levels in Maoa KO macrophages compared to those in Maoa WT macrophages (Fig.\u00a04b, c), we postulated that MAO-A may impact macrophage polarization through upregulating ROS levels and thereby sensitising the JAK-Stat6 signalling pathway. Indeed, direct analysis of TAMs isolated from B16-OVA tumor-bearing Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice confirmed that compared to wild-type TAMs, MAO-A-deficient TAMs showed reduced Stat6 activation (i.e., reduced Stat6 phosphorylation; Fig.\u00a04k, l). Further analysis of IL-4/IL-13-induced JAK-Stat6 signalling pathway in Maoa KO BMDMs compared to that in Maoa WT BMDMs showed significantly reduced JAK-Stat6 signalling (i.e., reduced JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Stat6 phosphorylation; Fig.\u00a04m). Supplementing H2O2 to IL-4/IL-13-stimulated Maoa WT and KO BMDMs increased their JAK-Stat6 signalling to similar levels (i.e., comparable JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Stat6 phosphorylation; Fig.\u00a04m), corresponding to their comparable high levels of ROS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, b). These data indicate that MAO-A promotes macrophage immunosuppressive polarization via ROS-sensitised JAK-Stat6 pathway activation.",
                        "Collectively, these in vivo and in vitro data support a working model that MAO-A promotes TAM immunosuppressive polarization in TME, at least partly through upregulating TAM intracellular ROS levels and thereby enhancing the IL-4/IL-13-induced JAK-Stat6 signalling pathway."

                        "The identification of MAO-A as a key regulator of TAM immunosuppressive polarization makes MAO-A a promising drug target for cancer immunotherapy. Because of the known functions of MAO-A in the brain, small-molecule MAOIs have been developed and clinically utilised for treating various neurological disorders, making it a highly feasible and attractive approach to repurpose these established MAOI drugs for cancer immunotherapy31,42. In an in vitro WT BMDM IL-4/IL-13-induced polarization culture (Fig.\u00a05a), addition of multiple MAOIs efficiently reduced ROS levels in BMDMs (Fig.\u00a05b) and suppressed their immunosuppressive polarization, evidenced by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206; Fig.\u00a05c) and immunosuppressive genes (i.e., Chi3l3 and Arg1; Fig.\u00a05d, e). Notably, the MAOIs that we tested include phenelzine, clorgyline, moclobemide, and pirlindole, covering the major categories of established MAOIs classified on the basis of whether they are non-selective or selective for MAO-A, and whether their effect is reversible (Fig.\u00a05a)31,43. Among these MAOIs, phenelzine (trade name: Nardil) is clinically available in the United States42. In the following studies, we chose phenelzine as a representative to study the possibility of repurposing MAOIs for cancer immunotherapy, using two syngeneic mouse tumor models: a B16-OVA melanoma model and a MC38 colon cancer model44. Of note, phenelzine is a non-selective irreversible MAOI that inhibits both MAO-A and its isoenzyme MAO-B31; however, because mouse macrophages predominantly express MAO-A over MAO-B, phenelzine treatment mainly regulates TAM reprogramming via inhibiting MAO-A in these tumor models (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a).Fig. 5MAO-A blockade for cancer immunotherapy\u2014syngeneic mouse tumor model studies.a\u2013e Studying the effect of MAOI treatment on IL-4/IL-13-induced BMDM polarization in vitro (n\u2009=\u20094). a Experimental design.

                        "First, we studied the therapeutic potential of phenelzine in a B16-OVA tumor prevention model (Fig.\u00a05f). Phenelzine treatment effectively suppressed B16-OVA tumor growth in B6 wild-type mice (Fig.\u00a05g, h). No tumor growth difference was observed when we depleted TAMs in experimental mice via a clodronate liposome treatment, indicating that phenelzine suppressed tumor growth via modulating TAMs (Fig.\u00a05g, h and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b). Correspondingly, TAMs isolated from phenelzine-treated mice displayed a less immunosuppressive phenotype, evidenced by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206; Fig.\u00a05i) and signature genes (i.e., Chi3l3 and Arg1; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c) while increased expression of immunostimulatory markers (i.e., CD69, CD86 and I-Ab; Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d\u2013f), that was correlated with an enhanced antitumor reactivity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (i.e., increased production of Granzyme B; Fig.\u00a05j) in these mice. Further studies showed that phenelzine treatment also effectively suppressed the progression of pre-established solid tumors in both B16-OVA and MC38 models (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05g\u2013k). Notably, similar to that for the B16-OVA tumor model, direct challenge of Maoa WT and KO mice with MC38 tumor cells also resulted in a significantly suppressed tumor growth in Maoa KO mice, confirming a general impact of MAO-A-deficiency on tumor growth for multiple tumor models (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05l\u2013n).",
                        "Next, we evaluated the potential of phenelzine for combination therapy, in particular combining with other ICB therapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy (Fig.\u00a05k). Although most ICB therapies target CD8+ T cells, these cells are in fact closely regulated by TAMs in the TME, making targeting TAMs another potential avenue for immunotherapy9,26. In both B16-OVA and MC38 tumor models, phenelzine treatment significantly suppressed the progression of pre-established solid tumors at a level comparable to the anti-PD-1 treatment; importantly, the combination of phenelzine and anti-PD-1 treatments yielded synergistic tumor suppression efficacy (Fig.\u00a05l\u2013o). These tumor suppression effects of phenelzine were due to immunomodulation but not direct tumor inhibition, because phenelzine treatment did not suppress the growth of B16-OVA and MC38 tumors in immunodeficient NSG mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05o\u2013s).",
                        "Collectively, these syngeneic mouse tumor model studies provided proof-of-principle evidence for the cancer immunotherapy potential of MAOIs via targeting TAM reprogramming and thereby enhancing antitumor T-cell responses."

                        "To explore the translational potential of MAO-A blockade therapy, we first studied MAO-A regulation of human macrophage polarization. Using a Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) computational method45, we analysed the gene expression signatures of in vitro-cultured immunostimulatory M1-like and immunosuppressive M2-like human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (GSE35449)46. Interestingly, among all immune checkpoint, immunostimulatory, and immunosuppressive genes examined, MAOA ranked as the top gene with the most dramatically elevated expression in M2-like MDMs (i.e., 7.28 M2/M1 log-fold change; Fig.\u00a06a), suggesting a possible role of MAO-A in promoting human macrophage immunosuppressive polarization. Time-course analysis of MDM culture confirmed an upregulation of MAO-A gene and protein expression during macrophage differentiation that was further upregulated post-IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization (Fig.\u00a06b\u2013d). Blockade of MAO-A using phenelzine significantly inhibited IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization of MDMs, evidenced by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206 and CD273; Fig.\u00a06e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a) and signature genes (i.e., ALOX15 and CD200R1; Fig.\u00a06f, g). Collectively, these in vitro data suggest that MAO-A is highly expressed in human macrophages especially during their immunosuppressive polarization, and that MAO-A blockade has the potential to reprogramme human macrophage polarization.Fig. 6MAO-A blockade for cancer immunotherapy\u2014human TAM and clinical data correlation studies.a Heatmap showing the mRNA expression fold change of the indicated genes in human M2-like/M1-like macrophages. b\u2013d Studying the MAO-A expression in in vitro-cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (n\u2009=\u20094). b, c QPCR analyses of MAOA mRNA expression in MDMs over the 6-day differentiation culture (b) and post the IL-4/IL-13-induced polarization (c). d Western blot analyses of MAO-A protein expression in IL-4/IL-13-polarized MDMs. e\u2013g Studying the IL-4/IL-13-induced polarization of human MDMs (n\u2009=\u20093). e FACS analyses of CD206 expression (***p\u2009<\u20090.001). f, g QPCR analyses of ALOX15 (f) (**p\u2009=\u20090.0012) and CD200R1 (g) (***p\u2009<\u20090.001) mRNA expression. h\u2013j Studying the in vivo polarization of human macrophages in a human tumor-TAM co-inoculation xenograft mouse model (n\u2009=\u20094). h Experimental design. i, j FACS analyses of CD206 (i) (**p\u2009=\u20090.0093) and CD273 (j) (**p\u2009=\u20090.0013) expression on TAMs (gated as hCD45+hCD11b+hCD14+ cells of TIIs). k\u2013m Studying the in vitro efficacy of phenelzine in reprogramming human TAMs and enhancing human T-cell antitumor reactivity (n\u2009=\u20096). k Experimental design. l, m FACS quantification of live tumor cells (gated as hCD45\u2212 cells) and ESO-T cells (gated as hCD45+hCD8+ESO-TCR+ cells).

                        "To directly evaluate whether MAOIs could reprogramme human TAM polarization in vivo, we established a human tumor/TAM xenograft NSG mouse model. A375 human melanoma cells were mixed with monocytes sorted from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and s.c. injected into NSG mice to form solid tumors, with or without phenelzine treatment after inoculation (Fig.\u00a06h). Phenelzine treatment effectively suppressed immunosuppressive polarization of human TAMs (gated as hCD45+hCD11b+hCD14+; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b), supported by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206 and CD273; Fig.\u00a06i, j).",
                        "Next, we studied whether MAOI-induced human TAM reprogramming could impact human T-cell antitumor reactivity, using a 3D human tumor/TAM/T-cell organoid culture (Fig.\u00a06k). NY-ESO-1, a well-recognised tumor antigen commonly expressed in a large variety of human cancers47, was chosen as the model tumor antigen. An A375 human melanoma cell line was engineered to co-express NY-ESO-1 as well as its matching MHC molecule, HLA-A2, to serve as the human tumor target (denoted as A375-A2-ESO; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c, d). NY-ESO-1-specific human CD8+ T cells were generated by transducing healthy donor peripheral blood CD8+ T cells with a Retro/ESO-TCR retroviral vector encoding a NY-ESO-1-specific TCR (clone 3A1; denoted as ESO-TCR); the resulting T cells, denoted as ESO-T cells, expressed ESO-TCRs and specifically targeted A375-A2-ESO tumor cells, thereby modelling the tumor-specific human CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06e, f). Human MDMs were cultured from healthy donor PBMCs, followed by IL-4/IL-13 stimulation to induce immunosuppressive polarization in the presence or absence of phenelzine treatment (Fig.\u00a06k). The A375-A2-ESO human melanoma cells, ESO-T cells, and IL-4/IL-13-polarized MDMs were mixed at a 2:2:1 ratio and placed in a 3D tumor organoid culture mimicking TME (Fig.\u00a06k). IL-4/IL-13-polarized MDMs effectively suppressed ESO-T-cell-mediated killing of A375-A2-ESO tumor cells; this immunosuppressive effect was largely alleviated by phenelzine treatment during MDM polarization (Fig.\u00a06l). Accordingly, ESO-T cells co-cultured with phenelzine-treated MDMs, compared to those co-cultured with non-phenelzine-treated MDMs, showed an enhancement in T-cell activation (i.e., increased cell number, increased CD25 expression, and decreased CD62L expression; Fig.\u00a06m and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06g). Collectively, these data suggest that MAOI-induced human TAM reprogramming has the potential to improve antitumor T-cell responses.",
                        "To study MAOA gene expression in primary human TAMs, we collected fresh ovarian cancer tumor samples from patients, isolated TAMs (sorted as DAPI\u2212hCD45+hCD11b+hTCR\u03b1\u03b2-hCD14+ cells; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06h), and assessed their MAOA gene expression. Primary human monocytes isolated from healthy donor PBMCs (sorted as DAPI\u2212hCD45+hCD11b+hTCR\u03b1\u03b2\u2212hCD14+ cells; Supplementary Fig.\u00a06i) were included as controls. Like mouse TAMs, human TAMs expressed high levels of MAOA gene, confirming MAO-A as a valid drug target in human TAMs (Figs.\u00a01a and \u00a06n).",
                        "Lastly, we conducted clinical data correlation studies to investigate whether intratumoral MAOA gene expression is correlated with clinical outcomes in cancer patients, using the TIDE computational method45. Intratumoral MAOA expression level was negatively correlated with patient survival in multiple cancer patient cohorts spanning ovarian cancer (Fig.\u00a06o)48, lymphoma (Fig.\u00a06p)49, and breast cancer (Fig.\u00a06q)50. Moreover, analysis of a melanoma patient cohort receiving anti-PD-1 treatment showed that high levels of intratumoral MAOA expression largely abrogated the survival benefit offered by the PD-1 treatment, suggesting that combining MAO-A blockade therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy may provide synergistic therapeutic benefits through modulating TAM polarization and thereby changing the immunosuppressive TME and improving antitumor immunity (Fig.\u00a06r)51. Of note, these whole-tumor lysate transcriptome data analyses could not localise the MAOA expression to a specific cell type (e.g., TAMs); future studies of quality transcriptome data generated from single cells or sorted TAMs are needed to obtain such information. Meanwhile, other intratumoral immune cells may also express MAOA and can mediate MAO-A-regulated antitumor immunity. For instance, human T cells have been indicated to express MAOA (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000189221-MAOA/blood); and in our syngeneic mouse tumor model studies using the Maoa KO mice, we have detected enhanced antitumor T-cell responses\u2014an effect that may result from a combination of MAO-A\u2019s direct regulation of T cells and indirect regulation of T-cell response via modulating TAMs. The study of MAO-A expression in various intratumoral immune cells, as well as MAO-A regulation of the antitumoral immunity of various immune cells, can be interesting directions for future research. Nonetheless, the present clinical data correlation studies identified MAO-A as a possible negative regulator of survival in a broad range of cancer patients, including those receiving existing ICB therapies, suggesting MAO-A blockade as a promising avenue for developing new\u00a0forms of cancer therapy and combination therapy.",
                        "Taken together, these human TAM and clinical correlation studies confirmed MAO-A as a promising drug target in human TAMs and support the translational potential of MAO-A blockade for cancer immunotherapy through targeting TAM reprogramming."

                "Based on our findings, we propose an \u201cintratumoral MAO-A-ROS axis\u201d model to elucidate the role of MAO-A in regulating TAM immunosuppressive polarization (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). Analogous to the well-characterised MAO-A-ROS axis in the brain, where MAO-A controls ROS levels in neurons and thereby modulates neuron degeneration via regulating neuron oxidative stress, the MAO-A-ROS axis in a solid tumor controls ROS levels in TAMs and thereby modulates TAM immunosuppressive polarization via sensitising the IL-4/IL-13-induced JAK-Stat6 signalling pathway (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). The resemblance between these mechanisms is intriguing: from an evolutionary point of view, it makes sense that some critical molecular regulatory pathways are preserved between the nervous and immune systems, considering that both systems are evolved to defend a living organism by sensing and reacting to environmental danger and stress. Indeed, neurons and immune cells share a broad collection of surface receptors, secretory molecules, and signal transducers52. In particular, many neurotransmitters/neuropeptides and their synthesis/degradation machineries traditionally considered specific for neurons are expressed in immune cells, although their functions in the immune system are to a large extent still unknown53. Studying these molecules and their regulatory mechanisms may provide new perspectives in tumor immunology and identifying new drug targets for cancer immunotherapies, as exemplified by our current finding of this \u201cMAO-A-ROS axis\u201d regulation of TAM polarization in the TME.",
                "Considering the importance of TAMs in regulating antitumor immunity, there has been considerable efforts in developing cancer therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs. These strategies can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) those which deplete TAMs, and (2) those which alter TAM immunosuppressive activities26. The first category includes strategies targeting TAM recruitment and survival, such as blocking the CCL2-CCR2 axis thereby preventing monocyte mobilisation from the bone marrow and recruitment into inflammatory sites, or blocking the CSF1-CSF1R axis thereby inducing apoptosis of TAMs, or blocking the CXCL12-CXCR4 and angiopoietin 2 (ANG2)-TIE2 axes thereby depleting TIE2+ macrophages that are critical for tumor angiogenesis26,54. However, an intrinsic downside of depleting TAMs is the loss of their innate immunostimulatory role as the primary phagocytes and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in solid tumors. Reprogramming or repolarizing immunosuppressive TAMs towards an immunostimulatory phenotype therefore can be an attractive direction; this second category of TAM-repolarizing strategies includes those reprogramming TAMs via CD40 agonists, HDAC inhibitors, PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors, and creatine26,55\u201358. Many of these TAM reprogramming strategies are currently under active clinical evaluation26. Notably, CD40 agonists work through activating CD40L-downstream NF-kB pathway56,59; HDAC inhibitors work through altering histone modifications55,60; PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors work through stimulating NF-\u03baB activation while inhibiting C/EBP\u03b2 activation57,61; and creatine uptake works through regulating cytokine responses58. Our discovery of MAO-A as a critical regulator of TAM polarization through modulating oxidative stress provides a drug target and a mechanism of action (MOA) for expanding TAM-repolarizing strategies.",
                "Compared to many new therapeutic candidates, MAO-A is unique in that it is already an established drug target due to its known functions in the brain42. In fact, small-molecule MAOIs have been developed to block MAO-A enzymatic activity in the brain and are clinically used for treating various neurological disorders42. Notably, some MAOIs cross-inhibit the MAO-A isoenzyme MAO-B, that co-expressed with MAO-A in the brain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07)31. However, in human macrophages, especially in M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, MAO-A is the dominant form (i.e., the expression of MAOA was about 40-fold higher than that of MAOB in M2-like human macrophages; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08)46. Of course, other tissues and cells may express significant levels of MAO-B that is subjected to MAOI inhibition and may mediate part of the MAOI-induced therapeutic effects. In our studies, we tested multiple clinically approved MAOIs (phenelzine, clorgyline, moclobemide, and pirlindole) and demonstrated their efficacy in regulating macrophage ROS levels and immunosuppressive polarization, pointing to the possibility of repurposing these drugs for cancer immunotherapy (Figs.\u00a05 and 6). Developing new cancer drugs is extremely costly and time-consuming; drug repurposing offers an economic and speedy pathway to novel cancer therapies because approved drugs have known safety profiles and modes of actions and thus can enter the clinic quickly62.",
                "MAOIs had been used extensively over two decades after their introduction in the 1950s, but since then their use has declined because of reported side effects and the introduction of other classes of antidepressant drugs42. However, these MAOI side effects may be manageable. For instance, a claimed major side effect of MAOIs is the risk of triggering tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis when patients eat tyramine-rich foods such as aged cheese (hence, \u201ccheese effects\u201d), which has led to cumbersome food restrictions42. The development of reversible and increasingly MAO-B-selective MAOI agents administered via a transdermal delivery system (i.e., the EMSAM selegiline transdermal system) has largely avoided the tyramine related \u201ccheese effects\u201d and thereby can relieve food restrictions and improve the overall safety of MAOIs63. Interest in MAOIs as a major class of antidepressants is reviving, and repurposing MAOIs for cancer immunotherapy can be an attractive application of these potent drugs42. Moreover, many cancer patients suffer from depression and anxiety; these overwhelming emotional changes can negatively interfere with the quality of life and cancer treatment efficacy of cancer patients64. Repurposing MAOIs for cancer immunotherapy thus may provide cancer patients with anti-depression and antitumor dual benefits, making this therapeutic strategy particularly attractive. Nonetheless, caution about drug:food and drug:drug interactions are still relevant for MAOIs\u2019 cancer therapy application, evidenced by the side effects (e.g., hypertension) observed in a recent Phase 2 trial of MAOI phenelzine in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer65.",
                "Because preclinical evidence largely supports combinatorial approaches being necessary to achieve significant antitumor efficacy, most TAM-targeting strategies currently under clinical evaluation are tested in combination with standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy or in combination with T-cell-directed ICB therapies such as PD-1 or/and PD-L1 blockade therapy26. In our study, we found that MAOI treatment synergised with anti-PD-1 treatment in suppressing syngeneic mouse tumor growth (Fig.\u00a05k\u2013o), and that intratumoral MAOA gene expression levels dictated poor patient survival in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy (Fig.\u00a06r). These data highlight the promise of MAOI treatment as a valuable component for combination cancer therapies.",
                "Interestingly, MAO-A upregulation has been detected in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues and MAO-A expression has been associated with cancer metastases and decreased cancer-related patient survival for several cancers, including prostate cancer66,67, lung cancer68,69, breast cancer70, glioma71 and lymphoma72. Together with our finding, these studies suggest the possible multifaceted function of MAO-A in promoting certain cancers, through the direct promotion of tumor development and indirect suppression of antitumor immunity. Consequently, MAO-A blockade therapy may provide dual therapeutic benefits for these cancers, by both suppressing tumor metastasis and enhancing antitumor immunity.",
                "In summary, here we identified MAO-A as a critical molecule regulating TAM immunosuppressive polarization and thereby modulating antitumor immunity, and demonstrated the potential of repurposing established MAOI antidepressants for cancer immunotherapy. Future clinical studies are encouraged to investigate the clinical correlations between MAOI treatment and clinical outcomes in cancer patients and to explore the possibility of repurposing MAOIs for combination cancer therapies. Meanwhile, the immune regulatory function of MAO-A certainly goes beyond regulating TAM polarization. Notably, in another recent\u00a0study, we have identified MAO-A as an immune checkpoint restraining antitumor T-cell immunity through controlling intratumoral T-cell autocrine serotonin signalling73. MAO-A\u2019s capacity to regulate various components of antitumor immunity is attractive, suggesting that MAO-A blockade may be multifunctional for cancer immunotherapy. It is also likely that MAO-A regulates immune reactions to other diseases such as infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. Studying the roles of MAO-A in regulating various immune cells under different health and disease conditions will be interesting topics for future research."

In total, 12.5\u2009ml of the cell suspension were added to each 10-cm dish and incubated for an hour in a humidified 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator. Medium that contained non-adherent cells was discarded. Dishes were washed twice and adherent monocytes were cultured in C10 media with human M-CSF (10\u2009ng/ml) (Peprotech, 300-25) for 6 days to generate MDMs. At day 6, the resulting MDMs were collected and reseeded in a 6-well plate in C10 medium (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/ 2\u2009ml/well) for 48\u2009h, in the presence or absence of recombinant human IL-4 (10\u2009ng/ml) (Peprotech, 214-14) and human IL-13 (10\u2009ng/ml) (Peprotech, 214-13) to induce MDM immunosuppressive polarization. In some experiments, MAOIs (phenelzine, 20\u2009\u03bcM) were added to the MDM polarization culture 30\u2009min prior to adding recombinant human IL-4 and human IL-13, to block MAO-A activity during MDM polarization. Polarized MDMs were then collected and used for flow cytometry and QPCR analysis or for setting up the 3D human tumor organoid culture experiments."

Specifically, cells were first filtered to have at least 300 UMIs (unique molecular identifiers), at least 100 genes, and at most 5% mitochondrial gene expression; only one cell did not pass the filter. The filtered matrix was normalised using the Seurat function NormalizeData. Variable genes were found using the Seurat function FindVariableGenes. The matrix was scaled to regress out the sequencing depth for each cell. Variable genes that had been previously identified were used in principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the data. Following this, 13 PCs were used in UMAP to further reduce the dimensions to 2. The same 13 PCs were also used to group the cells into different clusters by the Seurat function FindClusters. Next, marker genes were found for each cluster and used to define the cell types. Subsequently, two clusters of TAMs (identified by co-expression of Mrc1 and Cd86 signature genes) were extracted and compared between the Maoa WT and Maoa KO samples. Expression distribution of immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory signature genes in Maoa WT and Maoa KO TAMs were compared and presented in violin plots. scRNAseq datasets have been uploaded to GEO database with an accession number GSE153615."
