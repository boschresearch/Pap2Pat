                        "Over the past decade, cancer immunotherapy has achieved significant breakthroughs. In particular, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has yielded remarkable clinical responses and revolutionized the treatment of many cancers1. So far, the FDA has approved cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) blockade therapies for treating more than 10 different malignancies2, 3; however, only a small fraction of cancer patients respond to these therapies4, 5, 6. Most ICB therapies work through enhancing antitumour CD8+ T cell responses, which can be greatly limited by the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME)7. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the immunosuppressive TME, dampen T cell antitumour reactivity in the majority of solid tumours8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Growing evidence suggests that TAMs are responsible for inhibiting antitumour T cell reactivity and limiting the ICB therapy efficacy, making TAMs potential targets for reversing the immunosuppressive TME and improving cancer immunotherapy16, 17, 18.",
                        "TAMs mature from bone marrow-derived circulating monocytes. These monocytes are recruited to the tumour sites, exposed to chemokines and growth factors in the TME, and subsequently differentiate into TAMs19, 20, 21, 22. Depending on the surrounding immune environment, macrophages can be polarized toward an immunostimulatory phenotype by pro-inflammatory stimuli (e.g., IFN-\u03b3) or toward an immunosuppressive phenotype by anti-inflammatory stimuli (e.g., IL-4 and IL-13)23. Although a binary polarization system is commonly used in macrophage studies, in most large-scale transcriptome analyses, TAMs showed a continuum of phenotypes expressing both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive markers in addition to the extreme ends of polarization23, 24, 25. These mixed phenotypes and polarization states suggest the complexity of the TME and the residential TAM functionality. As a tumour develops, the enrichment of IL-4 and IL-13 produced by tumour cells and CD4+ T cells in the TME results in the polarization of TAMs towards an immunosuppressive phenotype, that promotes tumour growth, malignancy, and metastasis23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. In established solid tumours, TAMs predominately exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype, evidenced by their production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and arginase-1 (Arg1), as well as their expression of mannose receptor (CD206) and scavenger receptors31, 32, 33. Through metabolizing L-arginine via Arg1, TAMs can directly suppress cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses34, 35. Mannose receptor (CD206) expressed by TAMs can impair cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells by suppressing CD45 phosphatase activity36. In addition, TAMs can inhibit T cell activities through immune checkpoint engagement by expressing the ligands of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4. For example, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on TAMs interact with PD-1 of T cells to directly inhibit TCR signaling, cytotoxic function, and proliferation of CD8+ T cells31. These characteristics of TAMs make them potential targets for reversing the immunosuppressive TME to augment antitumour immunity.",
                        "Although the predominant phenotype of TAMs in established solid tumours is immunosuppressive, polarization is not fixed. Plasticity, one of the key features of TAMs, enables TAMs to change their phenotype in solid tumours and thereby providing a therapeutic window37, 38. Repolarizing/reprogramming TAMs from an immunosuppressive and tumour-promoting phenotype toward an immunostimulatory and tumouricidal phenotype has thus become an attractive strategy in immunotherapy27. Preclinical and clinical studies are ongoing, evaluating TAM-repolarizing reagents (e.g., CD40 agonists, HDAC inhibitors, PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors, creatine, etc.) for improving ICB therapy: certain efficacies have been reported17, 29, 31, 39, 40, 41, 42. Therefore, the search for new molecules regulating TAM polarization and the development of new combination treatments targeting TAM reprogramming are an active direction of current cancer immunotherapy studies.",
                        "For the reasons noted above, there is a need in the art for the development of methods and materials for regulating TAM polarization in cancer immunotherapies."

Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an enzyme best known for its function in the brain: small molecule MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are clinically used for treating neurological disorders. As discussed in detail below, we have discovered MAO-A induction in mouse and human TAMs. Moreover, we determined that MAO-A-deficient mice exhibited decreased TAM immunosuppressive functions corresponding with enhanced antitumour immunity.

Surprisingly, combining MAOI and anti-PD-1 treatments resulted in synergistic tumour suppression. In addition, clinical data correlation studies associated high intratumoural MAOA expression with poor patient survival in a broad range of cancers. We further demonstrated that MAO-A promotes TAM immunosuppressive polarization via upregulating oxidative stress. Together, these data identify MAO-A as a critical regulator of TAMs and provide strong evidence for repurposing MAOIs for TAM reprogramming to improve cancer immunotherapies.",

                        "Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an outer mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme encoded by the X-linked MAOA gene. MAO-A is best known for its function in the brain, where it is involved in the degradation of a variety of monoamine neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Through regulating the availability of serotonin, MAOA modulate neuronal activities thereby influencing mood and behavior in humans43, 44, 45, 46, 47. Through regulating the availability of dopamine and the abundance of dopamine breakdown byproduct hydrogen peroxide (H2O2: hence oxidative stress), MAO-A is involved in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD)48, 49. FDA-approved small-molecule MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are currently available for the treatment of neurological disorders, including depression and PD47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55. However, the functions of MAO-A outside of the brain are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of MAO-A in regulating TAM polarization and evaluated the possibility of repurposing MAOIs for reprogramming TAMs and improving cancer immunotherapy, using knockout and transgenic mice, preclinical mouse syngeneic and human xenograft tumour models, as well as human TAM and clinical data correlation studies.",

Other possible MAOIs that are suitable for loading include isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine. Liposomes can be synthesized using lipid biofilm, rehydration, sonication and extrusion (e.g., using membrane of 100 nm pore size) protocols. One can, for example, use a lipid bilayer that exhibits an DSPC/Cholesterol/DSPE-PEG2000 at molar ratio 3:2:0.15. For silicasome embodiments, a bare MSNP core can be constructed using a templating agent and silica precursors to make 80\u02dc90 nm particles. The particles can be produced in big batch sizes (e.g., \u02dc5 g/batch) and stably stored for 18\u02dc24 months, allowing aliquots to be removed at different project stages for carrier development. Phenelzine can be remotely imported using different trapping agents, such as triethylammmonium sucrose octasulfate, (NH4)2SO4 or citric acid. Lipid coatings can be introduced using ethanol injection method with controlled sonication power.

Monocytes isolated from tumour-free and tumour-bearing mice were included as controls. In addition to changes in classical genes involved in regulating macrophage immune responses, we observed the induction of a Maoa gene in TAMs (FIG. 1a), suggesting that MAO-A may be involved in modulating TAM activities.",
                                "To study the role of MAO-A in antitumour immunity in vivo, we used MAO-A-deficient mice that carry a hypomorphic MAO-A mutant56. Although a degree of Maoa expression leakage in the brain had been previously reported in these mice56, analysis of their immune system showed a nearly complete ablation of MAO-A expression in major lymphoid organs including spleen and bone marrow (BM) (FIG. 7a). Since we focused on immune cells in this study, we denote these mice as Maoa knockout (KO) mice. When challenged with B16-OVA melanoma cells (FIG. 1b), tumour growth in Maoa KO mice was significantly suppressed compared to that in Maoa wildtype (WT) mice (FIG. 1c,d). Although similar levels of TAMs (gated as CD45.2+CD11b+Ly6G\u2212Ly6C\u2212/lowF4/80+ cells) were detected in Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice (FIG. 7b,c), compared to their WT counterparts, TAMs isolated from Maoa KO mice exhibited a less immunosuppressive phenotype, indicated by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206: FIG. 1e), and their increased expression of immunostimulatory molecules (i.e., CD69, CD86, and MHC class II I-Ab: FIG. 1f-h). Further analysis showed that TAMs from Maoa KO mice expressed reduced levels of immunosuppression-associated genes (i.e., Mrc1, Chi313, and Arg1: FIG. 1i) and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (i.e., I16, Tnfa, and Cc12: FIG. 1j). Corresponding to the altered TAM polarization in Maoa KO mice, tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in these mice showed enhanced activation (i.e., increased production of Granzyme B: FIG. 7d). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis was performed on tumour infiltrating immune cells isolated from Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice (FIG. 1k and FIG. 7e,). UMAP analysis of extracted TAMs showed a reduced immunosuppressive phenotype in Maoa KO mice, with an increased ratio of Mrc1lowCd86high cells to Mrc1highCd86low cells (FIG. 1l and FIG. 7g). Gene expression profile analysis confirmed a reduction of TAMs expressing immunosuppressive genes (i.e., Mrc1 and Chi313: FIG. 1m) and an enrichment of TAMs expressing immunostimulatory genes (i.e., Cc12, Cc17, Cd86, H2-Aa, and H2-Ab1: FIG. 1n) in Maoa KO mice. These data strongly indicate that MAO-A is involved in regulating TAM polarization thereby modulating antitumour immunity.",

                                "In our Maoa KO mice tumour challenge study, MAO-A deficiency impacted both immune and non-immune cells (FIG. 1b). To determine whether MAO-A directly regulates immune cells, we conducted a BM transfer experiment wherein BM cells harvested from Maoa WT or KO mice were adoptively transferred into BoyJ (CD45.1) WT recipient mice followed by B16-OVA tumour challenge (FIG. 2a). In this experiment, MAO-A deficiency comparison was confined to immune cells. MAO-A deficiency in immune cells resulted in suppressed tumour growth (FIG. 2b,c), altered TAM polarization (i.e., downregulation of immunosuppressive markers such as CD206, FIG. 2d: and upregulation of immunostimulatory markers such as CD69, CD86, and MHC class II I-Ab: FIG. 2e,f and FIG. 8a), and enhanced tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cell activation (i.e., increased production of cytotoxic molecules such as Granzyme B: FIG. 8b), indicating that MAO-A directly regulates immune cell antitumour activity, in particular TAM polarization and T cell antitumour reactivity.",
                                "To further study whether MAO-A acts as a macrophage autonomous factor directly regulating TAM polarization and thereby influencing antitumour immunity, we performed a macrophage adoptive transfer tumour experiment. BM cells were harvested from Maoa WT and KO mice then cultured into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). These Maoa WT or KO BMDMs were then mixed with B16-OVA melanoma cells and subcutaneously (s.c.) injected into BoyJ WT recipient mice to establish solid tumours (FIG. 2g). In this study, MAO-A deficiency comparison was confined to TAMs. Suppressed tumour growth (FIG. 2h,i), downregulated expression of TAM immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206: FIG. 2j), upregulated expression of TAM immunostimulatory markers (i.e., CD69 and CD86: FIG. 2k,l), and enhanced tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cell reactivity (i.e., increased production of Granzyme B: FIG. 2m) were observed in mice receiving Maoa KO BMDMs. Collectively, these in vivo studies demonstrate that MAO-A acts as an autonomous factor directly regulating TAM polarization, and thereby influencing T cell antitumour reactivity and impacting tumour growth."

We observed a sharp induction of Maoa mRNA expression in Maoa WT BMDMs during macrophage development, that remained high post-IL-4/IL-13 stimulation (FIG. 3b,c). MAO-A expression was undetectable in Maoa KO BMDMs, confirming their Maoa-deficiency genotype (FIG. 3b,d). Compared to their wildtype counterpart, Maoa KO macrophages displayed a less immunosuppressive phenotype under IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, evidenced in their reduced expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206: FIG. 3e) and signature genes (i.e., Chi313 and Arg1: FIG. 3f,g). When tested in a macrophage/T cell co-culture assay (FIG. 3h), in agreement with their less immunosuppressive phenotype, IL-4/IL-13-polarized Maoa KO macrophages exhibited impaired suppression of wildtype CD8+ T cells under anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, shown as their attenuated inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation (FIG. 3i) and activation marker expression (i.e., upregulation of CD25 and CD44, and downregulation of CD62L: FIG. 3j,k and FIG. 9a).",

MAO-A overexpression significantly exacerbated the immunosuppressive phenotype of IL-4/IL-13-stimulated Maoa KO BMDMs (i.e., upregulation of immunosuppressive signature genes such as Chi313 and Arg1: FIG. 3o,p).

                                "Next, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating MAO-A promotion of macrophage immunosuppressive polarization. It has been reported that intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS: hence, oxidative stress) elicit macrophage immunosuppressive features57, 58, 59, 60, 61. MAO-A catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamines, thereby generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a byproduct that can increase intracellular ROS levels. We therefore speculated that MAO-A might promote TAM immunosuppressive polarization in TME via upregulating ROS levels in TAMs (FIG. 4a).",
                                "To test this hypothesis, we directly measured ROS levels in TAMs isolated from Maoa WT and KO mice bearing B16-OVA tumours and detected significantly lower levels of ROS in Maoa KO TAMs (FIG. 4b,c). Measurement of ROS levels in in vitro-cultured Maoa WT and KO BMDMs also showed reduced levels of ROS in Maoa KO BMDMs, with or without IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, in agreement with the in vivo TAM results (FIG. 4d). Supplementing H2O2 to IL-4/IL-13-stimulated Maoa WT and KO BMDMs elevated their intracellular ROS to similar levels (FIG. 10a,b) and eliminated their differences in expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206. FIG. 4e) and signature genes (i.e., Chi313 and Arg1: FIG. 4f,g).",
                                "On the other hand, supplementation of tyramine, a substrate of MAO-A, increased ROS levels and upregulated the expression of immunosuppressive genes (i.e., Chi313 and Arg1) in Maoa WT BMDMs but not in Maoa KO BMDMs (FIG. 4h-j). Taken together, these data indicate that MAO-A regulates macrophage immunosuppressive polarization via modulating macrophage intracellular ROS levels.",
                                "The JAK-Stat6 signaling pathway plays a key role in mediating IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization of TAMs in TME62, 63. After IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, JAK is phosphorylated and subsequently phosphorylates Stat6: phosphorylated Stat6 dimerizes and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the promoters of IL-4 and IL-13 responsive genes including those involved in macrophage immunosuppressive functions64, 65. ROS has been reported to promote JAK and Stat6 phosphorylation in a variety of cell types61, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71. Since we observed decreased ROS levels in Maoa KO macrophages compared to those in Maoa WT macrophages (FIG. 4b,c), we postulated that MAO-A may impact macrophage polarization through upregulating ROS levels and thereby sensitizing the JAK-Stat6 signaling pathway. Indeed, direct analysis of TAMs isolated from B16-OVA tumour-bearing Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice confirmed that compared to wildtype TAMs, MAO-A-deficient TAMs showed reduced Stat6 activation (i.e., reduced Stat6 phosphorylation: FIG. 4k,l). Further analysis of IL-4/IL-13-induced JAK-Stat6 signaling pathway in Maoa KO BMDMs compared to that in Maoa WT BMDMs showed significantly reduced JAK-Stat6 signaling (i.e., reduced JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Stat6 phosphorylation: FIG. 4m). Supplementing H2O2 to IL-4/IL-13-stimulated Maoa WT and KO BMDMs increased their JAK-Stat6 signaling to similar levels (i.e., comparable JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Stat6 phosphorylation: FIG. 4m), corresponding to their comparable high levels of ROS (FIG. 10a,b). These data indicate that MAO-A promotes macrophage immunosuppressive polarization via ROS-sensitized JAK-Stat6 pathway activation.",
                                "Collectively, these in vivo and in vitro data support a working model that MAO-A promotes TAM immunosuppressive polarization in TME, at least partly through upregulating TAM intracellular ROS levels and thereby enhancing the IL-4/IL-13-induced JAK-Stat6 signaling pathway."

                                "The identification of MAO-A as a key regulator of TAM immunosuppressive polarization makes MAO-A a promising new drug target for cancer immunotherapy. Because of the known functions of MAO-A in the brain, small molecule MAOIs have been developed and clinically utilized for treating various neurological disorders, making it a highly feasible and attractive approach to repurpose these established MAOI drugs for cancer immunotherapy51, 72. In an in vitro WT BMDM IL-4/IL-13-induced polarization culture (FIG. 5a), addition of multiple MAOIs efficiently reduced ROS levels in BMDMs (FIG. 5b) and suppressed their immunosuppressive polarization, evidenced by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206: FIG. 5c) and immunosuppressive genes (i.e., Chi313 and Arg1: FIG. 5d,e). Notably, the MAOIs that we tested include phenelzine, clorgyline, mocolobemide, and pirlindole, covering the major categories of established MAOIs classified on the basis of whether they are nonselective or selective for MAO-A, and whether their effect is reversible (FIG. 5a)51, 54, 73. Among these MAOIs, phenelzine (trade name: Nardil) is clinically available in the United States72. In the following studies, we chose phenelzine as a representative to study the possibility of repurposing MAOIs for cancer immunotherapy, using two syngeneic mouse tumour models: a B16-OVA melanoma model and a MC38 colon cancer model74.",
                                "First, we studied the therapeutic potential of phenelzine in a B16-OVA tumour prevention model (FIG. 5f). Phenelzine treatment effectively suppressed B16-OVA tumour growth in B6 wildtype mice (FIG. 5g,h). No tumour growth difference was observed when we depleted TAMs in experimental mice via a clodronate liposome treatment, indicating that phenelzine suppressed tumour growth via modulating TAMs (FIG. 5g,h and FIG. 11a). Correspondingly, TAMs isolated from phenelzine-treated mice displayed a less immunosuppressive phenotype (i.e., decreased expression of CD206: FIG. 5i) that was correlated with an enhanced antitumour reactivity of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (i.e., increased production of Granzyme B: FIG. 5j) in these mice. Further studies showed that phenelzine treatment also effectively suppressed the progression of pre-established solid tumours in both B16-OVA and MC38 models (FIG. 11b-f).",
                                "Next, we evaluated the potential of phenelzine for combination therapy, in particular combining with other ICB therapies such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy (FIG. 5k). Although most ICB therapies target CD8+ T cells, these cells are in fact closely regulated by TAMs in the TME, making targeting TAMs another potential avenue for immunotherapy14, 39. In both B16-OVA and MC38 tumour models, phenelzine treatment significantly suppressed the progression of pre-established solid tumours at a level comparable to the anti-PD-1 treatment: importantly, the combination of phenelzine and anti-PD-1 treatments yielded synergistic tumour suppression efficacy (FIG. 5l-o). These tumour suppression effects of phenelzine were due to immunomodulation but not direct tumour inhibition, because phenelzine treatment did not suppress the growth of B16-OVA and MC38 tumours in immunodeficient NSG mice (FIG. 11g-k).",
                                "Collectively, these syngeneic mouse tumour model studies provided proof-of-principle evidence for the cancer immunotherapy potential of MAOIs via targeting TAM reprogramming and thereby enhancing antitumour T cell responses."

                                "To explore the translational potential of MAO-A blockade therapy, we first studied MAO-A regulation of human macrophage polarization. Using a Tumour Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) computational method75, we analyzed the gene expression signatures of in vitro cultured immunostimulatory MI-like and immunosuppressive M2-like human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) (GSE35449)76. Interestingly, among all immune checkpoint and immune suppressive genes examined, MAOA ranked as the top gene with the most dramatically elevated expression in M2-like MDMs (i.e., 7.28 M2/M1 log-fold change: FIG. 6a), suggesting a possible role of MAO-A in promoting human macrophage immunosuppressive polarization. Time-course analysis of MDM culture confirmed an upregulation of MAO-A gene and protein expression during macrophage differentiation that was further upregulated post IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization (FIG. 6b-d). Blockade of MAO-A using phenelzine significantly inhibited IL-4/IL-13-induced immunosuppressive polarization of MDMs, evidenced by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206 and CD273: FIG. 6e and FIG. 12a) and signature genes (i.e., ALOX15 and CD200R1: FIG. 6f,g). Collectively, these in vitro data suggest that MAO-A is highly expressed in human macrophages especially during their immunosuppressive polarization, and that MAO-A blockade has the potential to reprogram human macrophage polarization.",
                                "To directly evaluate whether MAO-A blockade could reprogram human TAM polarization in vivo, we established a human tumour/TAM xenograft NSG mouse model. A375 human melanoma cells were mixed with monocytes sorted from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and s.c. injected into NSG mice to form solid tumours, with or without phenelzine treatment after inoculation (FIG. 6h). Phenelzine treatment effectively suppressed immunosuppressive polarization of human TAMs (gated as hCD45+hCD11b+hCD14+: FIG. 12b), supported by their decreased expression of immunosuppressive markers (i.e., CD206 and CD273: FIG. 6i,j).",
                                "Next, we studied whether MAO-A blockade-induced human TAM reprogramming could impact human T cell antitumour reactivity, using a 3D human tumour/TAM/T cell organoid culture (FIG. 6k). NY-ESO-1, a well-recognized tumour antigen commonly expressed in a large variety of human cancers77, was chosen as the model tumour antigen. An A375 human melanoma cell line was engineered to co-express NY-ESO-1 as well as its matching MHC molecule, HLA-A2, to serve as the human tumour target (denoted as A375-A2-ESO: FIG. 12c,d). NY-ESO-1-specific human CD8+ T cells were generated by transducing healthy donor peripheral blood CD8+ T cells with a Retro/ESO-TCR retroviral vector encoding an NY-ESO-1 specific TCR (clone 3A1: denoted as ESO-TCR): the resulting T cells, denoted as ESO-T cells, expressed ESO-TCRs and specifically targeted A375-A2-ESO tumour cells, thereby modeling the tumour-specific human CD8+ T cells (FIG. 12e,f). Human MDMs were cultured from healthy donor PBMCs, followed by IL-4/IL-13 stimulation to induce immunosuppressive polarization in the presence or absence of phenelzine treatment (FIG. 6k). The A375-A2-ESO human melanoma cells, ESO-T cells, and IL-4/IL-13-polarized MDMs were mixed at a 2:2:1 ratio and placed in a 3D tumour organoid culture mimicking TME (FIG. 6k). IL-4/IL-13-polarized MDMs effectively suppressed ESO-T cell-mediated killing of A375-A2-ESO tumour cells: this immunosuppressive effect was largely alleviated by phenelzine treatment during MDM polarization (FIG. 6l). Accordingly, ESO-T cells co-cultured with phenelzine-treated MDMs, compared to those co-cultured with non-phenelzine-treated MDMs, showed an enhancement in T cell activation (i.e., increased cell number, increased CD25 expression, and decreased CD62L expression: FIG. 6m and FIG. 12g). Collectively, these data suggest that MAO-A blockade-induced human TAM reprogramming has the potential to improve antitumour T cell responses.",
                                "To study MAOA gene expression in primary human TAMs, we collected fresh ovarian cancer tumour samples from patients, isolated TAMs (sorted as DAPI-hCD45+hCD11b+hTCR\u03b1\u03b2\u2212hCD14+ cells: FIG. 12h), and assessed their MAOA gene expression. Primary human monocytes isolated from health donor PBMCs (sorted as DAPI\u2212hCD45+hCD11b+hTCR\u03b1\u03b2\u2212hCD14+ cells: FIG. 12i) were included as controls. Like mouse TAMs, human TAMs expressed high levels of MAOA gene, confirming MAO-A as a valid drug target in human TAMs (FIG. 1a and FIG. 6n).",
                                "Lastly, we conducted clinical data correlation studies to investigate whether intratumoural MAOA gene expression is correlated with clinical outcomes in cancer patients, using the TIDE computational method75. Intratumoural MAOA expression level was negatively correlated with patient survival in multiple cancer patient cohorts spanning ovarian cancer (FIG. 6o)78, lymphoma (FIG. 6p)79, and breast cancer (FIG. 6q)80. Moreover, analysis of a melanoma patient cohort receiving anti-PD-1 treatment showed that high levels of intratumoural MAOA expression largely abrogated the survival benefit offered by the PD-1 treatment, suggesting that combining MAO-A blockade therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy may provide synergistic therapeutic benefits through modulating TAM polarization and thereby changing the immunosuppressive TME and improving antitumour immunity (FIG. 6r)81. Of note, these whole tumour lysate transcriptome data analyses could not localize the MAOA expression to a specific cell type (e.g., TAMs): future studies of quality transcriptome data generated from single cells or sorted TAMs are needed to obtain such information. Nonetheless, the present clinical data correlation studies identified MAO-A as a possible negative regulator of survival in a broad range of cancer patients, including those receiving existing ICB therapies, suggesting MAO-A blockade as a promising avenue for developing new forms cancer therapy and combination therapy.",
                                "Taken together, these human TAM and clinical correlation studies confirmed MAO-A as a promising drug target in human TAMs and support the translational potential of MAO-A blockade for cancer immunotherapy through targeting TAM reprogramming."

                        "Based on our findings, we propose an \u201cintratumoural MAO-A-ROS axis\u201d model to elucidate the role of MAO-A in regulating TAM immunosuppressive polarization (FIG. 13). Analogous to the well-characterized MAO-A-ROS axis in the brain, where MAO-A controls ROS levels in neurons and thereby modulates neuron degeneration via regulating neuron oxidative stress, the MAO-A-ROS axis in a solid tumour controls ROS levels in TAMs and thereby modulates TAM immunosuppressive polarization via sensitizing the IL-4/IL-13-induced JAK-Stat6 signaling pathway (FIG. 13). The resemblance between these mechanisms is intriguing: from an evolutionary point of view, it makes sense that some critical molecular regulatory pathways are preserved between the nervous and immune systems, considering that both systems are evolved to defend a living organism by sensing and reacting to environmental danger and stress. Indeed, neurons and immune cells share a broad collection of surface receptors, secretory molecules, and signal transducers82. In particular, many neurotransmitters/neuropeptides and their synthesis/degradation machineries traditionally considered specific for neurons are expressed in immune cells, although their functions in the immune system are to a large extent still unknown83, 84. Studying these molecules and their regulatory mechanisms may provide new perspectives in tumour immunology and identifying new drug targets for cancer immunotherapies, as exemplified by our current finding of this \u201cMAO-A-ROS axis\u201d regulation of TAM polarization in the TME.",
                        "Considering the importance of TAMs in regulating antitumour immunity, there has been considerable efforts in developing cancer therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs. These strategies can be roughly divided into two categories: 1) those which deplete TAMs, and 2) those which alter TAM immunosuppressive activities39. The first category includes strategies targeting TAM recruitment and survival, such as blocking the CCL2-CCR2 axis thereby preventing monocyte mobilization from the bone marrow and recruitment into inflammatory sites, or blocking the CSF1-CSF1R axis thereby inducing apoptosis of TAMs, or blocking the CXCL12-CXCR4 and angiopoietin 2 (ANG2)-TIE2 axes thereby depleting TIE2V macrophages that are critical for tumour angiogenesis19, 39, 85. However, an intrinsic downside of depleting TAMs is the loss of their innate immunostimulatory role as the primary phagocytes and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in solid tumours. Reprogramming or repolarizing immunosuppressive TAMs towards an immunostimulatory phenotype therefore can be an attractive direction: this second category of TAM-repolarizing strategies includes those reprogramming TAMs via CD40 agonists, HDAC inhibitors, PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors, and creatine39, 40, 86, 87, 88. Many of these TAM reprogramming strategies are currently under active clinical evaluation39. Notably, CD40 agonists work through activating CD40L-downstream NF-kB pathway87, 89: HDAC inhibitors work through altering histone modifications86, 90, 91: PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors work through stimulating NF-\u03baB activation while inhibiting C/EBP\u03b2 activation88, 92, 93: and creatine uptake works through regulating cytokine responses40. Our discovery of MAO-A as a critical regulator of TAM polarization through modulating oxidative stress provides a new drug target and a new mechanism of action (MOA) for expanding TAM-repolarizing strategies.",
                        "Compared to many new therapeutic candidates, MAO-A is unique in that it is already an established drug target due to its known functions in the brain72. In fact, small molecule MAOIs have been developed to block MAO-A enzymatic activity in the brain and are clinically used for treating various neurological disorders72. Notably, some MAOIs cross-inhibit the MAO-A isoenzyme MAO-B, that co-expresses with MAO-A in the brain (FIG. 13)51. However, in human macrophages, especially in M2-like immunosuppressive macrophages, MAO-A is the dominant form (i.e., the expression of MAOA was about 40-fold higher than that of MAOB in M2-like human macrophages: FIG. 14)76. In our studies, we tested multiple clinically approved MAOIs (phenelzine, clorgyline, moclobemide, and pirlindole) and demonstrated their efficacy in regulating macrophage ROS levels and immunosuppressive polarization, pointing to the possibility of repurposing these drugs for cancer immunotherapy (FIGS. 5 and 6). Developing new cancer drugs is extremely costly and time-consuming: drug repurposing offers an economic and speedy pathway to novel cancer therapies because approved drugs have known safety profiles and modes of actions and thus can enter the clinic quickly94.",
                        "MAOIs had been used extensively over two decades after their introduction in the 1950s, but since then their use has declined because of reported side effects and the introduction of other classes of antidepressant drugs72. However, these MAOIs side effects were vastly overstated and should be revisited72. For instance, a claimed major side effect of MAOIs is the risk of triggering tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis when patients eat tyramine-rich foods such as aged cheese (hence, \u201ccheese effects\u201d): this concern led to cumbersome food restrictions that are now considered largely unnecessary72. A transdermal delivery system (Emsam) has also been developed to deliver MAOIs that can largely avoid potential food restrictions95. Therefore, interest in MAOIs as a major class of antidepressants is reviving, and repurposing MAOIs for cancer immunotherapy can be an attractive new application of these potent drugs72. Moreover, many cancer patients suffer from depression and anxiety: these overwhelming emotional changes can negatively interfere with the quality of life and cancer treatment efficacy of cancer patients96. Repurposing MAOIs for cancer immunotherapy thus may provide cancer patients with anti-depression and antitumour dual benefits, making this therapeutic strategy particularly attractive.",
                        "Because preclinical evidence largely supports combinatorial approaches being necessary to achieve significant antitumour efficacy, most TAM-targeting strategies currently under clinical evaluation are tested in combination with standard chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or in combination with T cell-directed ICB therapies such as PD-1 or/and PD-L1 blockade therapy39. In our study, we found that MAOI treatment synergized with anti-PD-1 treatment in suppressing syngeneic mouse tumour growth (FIG. 5k-o), and that intratumoural MAOA gene expression levels dictated poor patient survival in melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy (FIG. 6r). These data highlight the promise of MAOI treatment as a valuable component for combination cancer therapies.",
                        "In summary, here we identified MAO-A as a critical molecule regulating TAM immunosuppressive polarization and thereby modulating antitumour immunity, and demonstrated the potential of repurposing established MAOI antidepressants for cancer immunotherapy. Future clinical studies are encouraged to investigate the clinical correlations between MAOI treatment and clinical outcomes in cancer patients and to explore the possibility of repurposing MAOIs for combination cancer therapies. Meanwhile, the immune regulatory function of MAO-A certainly goes beyond regulating TAM polarization. In Maoa KO mice, we have observed the changes of antitumour responses of multiple immune cells in various syngeneic mouse tumour models. It is also likely that MAO-A regulates immune reactions to other diseases such as infection diseases and autoimmune diseases. Studying the roles of MAO-A in regulating various immune cells under different health and disease conditions will be interesting topics for future research."

After 15 minutes incubation at room temperature, cells were immediately washed with cold PBS followed by flow cytometry analysis. ROS levels were measured by oxidation of the CM-H2DCFDA probes that can be read out as the fluorescence intensity at the FITC/488 channel of a flow cytometer.\n\nSingle cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)\n\nscRNASeq was used to analyze the gene expression profiles of TIIs. B16-OVA tumours were harvested from Maoa WT and Maoa KO mice to prepare TII suspensions (10 tumours were combined for each group). TII suspensions were then sorted using a FACSAria II flow cytometer to purify immune cells (gated as DAPI-CD45.2+ cells). Sorted TIIs were immediately delivered to the Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics (TCGB) facility at UCLA for library construction and sequencing. Cells were stained with trypan blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, T10282) and counted using a Cell Countess II automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 10,000 TIIs from each experimental group were loaded on the Chromium platform (10X Genomics) and libraries were constructed using a Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 library & Gel Bead Kit V2 (10X Genomics, PN-120237) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 System, using a Novaseq 6000 S2 Reagent Kit (100 cycles: 20012862, Illumina). Data analysis was performed using a Cellranger Software Suite (10X Genomics). BCL files were extracted from the sequencer and used as inputs for the cellranger pipeline to generate the digital expression matrix for each sample. Then cellranger aggr command was used to aggregate the two samples into one digital expression matrix. The matrix was analyzed using Seurat, an R package designed for single cell RNA sequencing. Specifically, cells were first filtered to have at least 300 UMIs (unique molecular identifiers), at least 100 genes and at most 50% mitochondrial gene expression: only 1 cell did not pass the filter. The filtered matrix was normalized using the Seurat function NormalizeData. Variable genes were found using the Seurat function FindVariableGenes. The matrix was scaled to regress out the sequencing depth for each cell. Variable genes that had been previously identified were used in principle component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the data. Following this, 13 PCs were used in UMAP to further reduce the dimensions to 2. The same 13 PCs were also used to group the cells into different clusters by the Seurat function FindClusters. Next, marker genes were found for each cluster and used to define the cell types. Subsequently, 2 clusters of TAMs (identified by co-expression of Mrc1 and Cd86 signature genes) were extracted and compared between the Maoa WT and Maoa KO samples. Expression distribution of immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory signature genes in Maoa WT and Maoa KO TAMs were compared and presented in violin plots."
