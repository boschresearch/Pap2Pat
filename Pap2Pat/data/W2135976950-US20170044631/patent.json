Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compromises the immune system, while Dengue virus (DENV) causes hemorrhagic fever and West Nile virus (WNV) can cause encephalitis and other neuroinflammatory symptoms. Infection with these viruses causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Furthermore, as these viruses are transmitted primarily by blood-borne routes, the presence of infected individuals in the population raises the risk of blood or blood-products from infected donors being transfused to uninfected individuals."

The products of an amplification reaction are called amplification products. An example of in vitro amplification is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which a sample (such as a biological sample from a subject) is contacted with a pair of oligonucleotide primers, under conditions that allow for hybridization of the primers to a nucleic acid molecule in the sample. The primers are extended under suitable conditions, dissociated from the template, and then re-annealed, extended, and dissociated to amplify the number of copies of the nucleic acid molecule. Other examples of in vitro amplification techniques include real-time PCR, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP; see Notomi et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 28:e63, 2000); reverse-transcriptase LAMP (RT-LAMP); strand displacement amplification (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,311); transcription-free isothermal amplification (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,881); repair chain reaction amplification (see WO 90/01069); ligase chain reaction amplification (see EP-A-320 308); gap filling ligase chain reaction amplification (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,930); coupled ligase detection and PCR (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,027,889); and NASBA\u2122 RNA transcription-free amplification (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,134).",

It is estimated that as many as 400 million individuals are infected with DENV yearly worldwide and over 100 million cases of Dengue fever occur annually. DENV infection causes Dengue fever with symptoms including high fever, severe headache, severe joint, muscle, and bone pain, and rash. DENV also causes Dengue hemorrhagic fever, characterized by a fever lasting 2-7 days, followed by persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and hemorrhagic manifestations, including ascites, pleural effusions, or hemorrhagic shock. Dengue hemorrhagic fever may arise when an individual previously infected with one DENV serotype is infected with another DENV serotype and antibody-dependent enhancement occurs due to the presence of cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies.",

Acceptor fluorophores have an excitation spectrum that overlaps with the emission of the donor fluorophore, such that energy emitted by the donor can excite the acceptor. Ideally, an acceptor fluorophore is capable of being attached to a nucleic acid molecule.",

Appropriate samples include any conventional biological samples, including clinical samples obtained from a human or veterinary subject. Suitable samples include all biological samples useful for detection of infection in subjects, including, but not limited to, cells (such as buccal cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells), tissues, autopsy samples, bone marrow aspirates, bodily fluids (for example, blood, serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, middle ear fluids, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirates, oropharyngeal aspirates, or saliva), oral swabs, eye swabs, cervical swabs, vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, stool, and stool suspensions. The sample can be used directly or can be processed, such as by adding solvents, preservatives, buffers, or other compounds or substances. In some examples, nucleic acids are isolated from the sample. In other examples, isolation of nucleic acids from the sample is not necessary prior to use in the methods disclosed herein and the sample (such as a plasma or serum sample) is used directly (without nucleic acid extraction, but potentially with heat-treatment or other processing step). In further examples, the sample is pre-treated with a lysis buffer, but nucleic acids are not isolated prior to use in the disclosed methods.",

Nucleic acids can be extracted using standard methods. For instance, rapid nucleic acid preparation can be performed using a commercially available kit (such as kits and/or instruments from Qiagen (such as QiaAmpO, DNEasy\u00ae or RNEasy\u00ae kits), Roche Applied Science (such as MagNA Pure kits and instruments), Thermo Scientific (KingFisher mL), bioMerieux (Nuclisens\u00ae NASBA Diagnostics), or Epicentre (Masterpure\u2122 kits)).

LAMP is a one-step isothermal amplification method that can produce amplified nucleic acids in a short period of time using a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (see, e.g., Notomi et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 28:e63, 2000). LAMP can be used for amplification of RNA targets with the addition of reverse transcriptase (RT) to the reaction without an additional heat step (referred to as RT-LAMP). The isothermal nature of LAMP and RT-LAMP allows for assay flexibility because it can be used with simple and inexpensive heating devices, which can facilitate viral detection in settings other than centralized clinical laboratories. In addition, LAMP and RT-LAMP assays are rapid, specific, and sensitive.",

This capability is advantageous, for example, because it allows for incorporation of internal control(s), amplification of two or more regions within the same target, or detection of two or more targets or pathogens in a single reaction. In some examples, the disclosed methods include a multiplex LAMP or RT-LAMP assay for detection and/or discrimination of one or more of HBV, HCV, HEV, HIV, WNV, and DENV in a single reaction.",

In some examples, accumulation of an amplification product is detected by measuring the turbidity of the reaction mixture (for example, visually or with a turbidometer). In other examples, amplification product is detected using gel electrophoresis, for example by detecting presence or amount of amplification product with agarose gel electrophoresis. The particular viral nucleic acid may be determined in some cases by the band pattern observed on gel electrophoresis (for example, HCV-1, HCV-2, and HCV-3 can be discriminated by the pattern of bands on gel electrophoresis). In some examples, amplification product is detected using a colorimetric assay, such as with an intercalating dye (for example, propidium iodide, SYBRO green, GelRed\u2122, or GelGreen\u2122 dyes). In further examples, amplification product is detected with a metal ion sensitive fluorescent molecule (for example, calcein, which is a fluorescence dye that is quenched by manganese ions and has increased fluorescence when bound to magnesium ions). In other examples, amplification products are detected using a detectable label incorporated in one or more of the LAMP primers (discussed below). The detectable label may be optically detectable, for example, by eye or using a spectrophotometer or fluorimeter. In some examples, the detectable label is a fluorophore, such as those described above. In some examples, the label is detected using a fluorescence scanner (such as ESEQuant Tube Scanner, Qiagen; NanoDrop\u2122 3300 Fluorospectrometer, Thermo Scientific).

In other examples, the amount of viral nucleic acid in a sample is determined semi-quantitatively or quantitatively. For example, the amount of viral nucleic acid in a test sample can be determined by comparing the amount of fluorescence obtained in a LAMP assay with fluorescence obtained in a LAMP assay with samples containing known amounts of the viral nucleic acid of interest or a standard curve prepared from such samples.",

The buffer can also act as a cell lysis buffer, and thus can be used directly with samples such as blood, serum, or plasma, without prior nucleic acid extraction.",
                                "In some embodiments, the buffer (referred to herein as mannitol acetate buffer, or MAB) has a pH of about 7.8 (such as about 7.7-7.9) and includes about 2% D-mannitol, about 0.2% Triton\u00ae-X100, about 40 mM Tris-HCl, about 20 mM KCl, about 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, about 6 mM MgSO4, about 0.5 M L-proline, about 10 mM Tris acetate, about 1.6 mM magnesium acetate, and about 15 mM potassium acetate. In some examples, the MAB also includes one or more dNTPs, such as dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and/or dTTP. In some examples, the MAB includes about 2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. In other examples, the MAB is as listed above, however, D-mannitol is included at 1-3%, L-proline is included at 0.2-0.5 M, and/or Triton\u00ae-X100 is included at 0.1-0.3%.",
                                "The MAB is highly stable at a range of temperatures and for long periods of time. For example, LAMP reactions can still be successfully performed following storage of the MAB at room temperature for extended periods of time and/or following exposure of the MAB to heating. In some examples, the MAB is stable when stored at room temperature (about 20-27\u00b0 C., such as about 22-25\u00b0 C.) for 1 day to at least about 6 months. In particular examples, the MAB is stable at room temperature for at least about 6 months, at least about 12 months, at least about 18 months, at least about 24 months, or more. In other examples, the MAB is stable when heated to at least about 60\u00b0 C. for 30-60 minutes and cooled to room temperature one or more times.",

For example, MAB can be used in place of other commercially available reaction buffers in nucleic acid synthesis or amplification reactions. In other examples, the MAB buffer is used for cell lysis. Thus, MAB can be used in single tube reactions that include a sample containing cells (such as a blood, plasma, or serum sample), primers (such as one or more sets of LAMP primers disclosed herein), enzymes (such as DNA polymerase and in some cases reverse transcriptase), and other reagents.",
                                "The MAB buffer provides several advantages over conventional reaction and/or lysis buffers. As discussed above, MAB is extremely stable over a range of storage times and temperature exposures. In addition, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the buffer has a destabilizing effect on double-stranded nucleic acids, lowers the Tm of DNA, and/or stabilizes DNA polymerase. As a result, decreased reaction times and/or temperatures can be used for reactions including MAB as compared to conventional buffers. For example, use of MAB can decrease the necessary reaction times for reverse transcription, PCR,",

                                "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a blood-borne pathogen which infects over 4 million people yearly. About 350 million people world-wide are chronically infected and are infectious carriers of the virus. Mainly transmitted through blood-borne methods, HBV-infection can lead to hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and often co-infects with HCV and HIV (Liang, Hepatology 49:S13-S21, 2009; Arababadi et al, Clin. Res. Hepatol. Gastroenterol. 35:554-559, 2011; Kim et al., BMC Infect. Dis. 12:160, 2012).",
                                "HBV is a circular, partially double-stranded DNA virus of 3.2 kilobases. There are 8 known genotypes (A to H) that are divergent by >8% across the entire genome and are distributed world-wide (Okamoto et al., J. Gen Virol. 69:2575-2583, 1988; Wai et al., Clin. Liver Dis. 8:321-352, 2004; Wong et al., Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 25:570-577, 2012). Describing epidemiology of HBV does add to the literature, but treatment remains far-fetched in the developing world due to the high cost of anti-virals. However, a tool capable of generally detecting the major HBV genotypes may help in understanding the global geographic prevalence of HBV, aid in addressing the burden that HBV infection places on health care systems, and guide public health and clinicians in designing preventive and therapeutic measures.",
                                "Infection with HBV is a global public health problem, particularly in poorer countries where health care resources are limited and inaccessible. According to the WHO, countries in regions of Asia, Africa, and South/Central America have high HBV carrier rates of over 8% (Franco et al., World J. Hepatol. 4:74-80, 2012; Ott et al., Vaccine 30:2212-2219, 2012). This problem is compounded by the lack of advanced medical and diagnostic laboratory services for donor screening or routine testing of patients.",
                                "In many developed countries, blood-donors are screened for HBV surface antigen, antibodies to the core of HBV, and HBV-DNA in order to ensure safe blood-supply and clinical diagnosis. Such tests are conventionally performed with tests including, ELISA and real-time PCR. These tests are time-consuming, expensive, and require skilled personnel and elaborate equipment to perform (Caliendo et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 49:2854-2858, 2011; Kao, Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol 2:553-562, 2008; Wang et al., J. Biomed. Nanotechnol. 8:786-790, 2012). Hence, there is a need for a rapid and cost-effective detection tool for screening blood-donors and testing patient specimens for HBV infection in endemic as well as resource-limited environments.",
                                "A simple, sensitive, and specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (HBV-LAMP) for rapid and universal detection of all the major HBV genotypes in peripheral blood is described herein. LAMP is a DNA amplification method that uses 2 to 3 pairs of sequence-specific primers and a DNA strand-displacement process for amplification under isothermal conditions. The amplification results in multiple inverted repeats of amplicons that form a ladder-like banding pattern. This unique and portable detection tool has the potential for use in point-of-care settings for blood-screening and patient follow-up.",

A total of 182 donor-plasma specimens were also used for assay development and evaluation. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp\u00ae DNA Blood-Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, Md.) according to manufacturer's protocol. DNA was extracted from 200-400 \u03bcL of plasma-standards and eluted in 50-150 \u03bcL of Qiagen Buffer AE. Nucleic acid from the clinical specimens was concentrated by addition of 0.5 M Ammonium-Acetate and 0.05 mg/mL glycerol (Ambion/Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.), precipitated with one volume of 100% Isopropanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), centrifuged, and the DNA pellet re-suspended in 25-35 \u03bcL of Buffer AE.

Primers were manually designed, aided by PrimerExplorer4 and Primer3 web-interfaces, and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa) and EuroFins MWG Operon (Huntsville, Ala.).

This underscores the need for a simple and rapid diagnostic and screening tool that is applicable not only in resource-limited settings, but also in any region of the world with high prevalence of HBV infections. In the developed world, the HBV LAMP assay could be useful to verify that a patient undergoing HBV treatment has achieved full virological suppression.",
                                "This example describes development and validation of a sensitive and rapid isothermal amplification assay for pan-detection of HBV-genotypes (A-F) in plasma specimens. The HBV LAMP assay offers several advantages over conventional \u201cgold standard\u201d methods like real-time PCR or ELISA: (i) the assay does not require sophisticated equipment and costly reagents; (ii) it requires less time (<60 minutes) to conduct; (iii) the assay is performed on a simple digital heat-block; and, (iv) it does not require high-level technical expertise. Thus, in regions with struggling national economies and lack of high-tech diagnostic equipment, these advantages make the HBV LAMP assay well-suited for use in such resource-limited settings for blood-screening and diagnosis of HBV infection.",
                                "The sensitivity of the HBV-LAMP assay was evaluated in order to assess its clinical and field applicability, using characterized standards and blinded clinical plasma specimens. When compared to the FDA-licensed Procleix\u00ae Ultrio\u00ae-Plus dHBV test, the HBV-LAMP assay detected 69 of 75 (92%) HBV positive donor plasma specimens. The assay sensitivity approaches 100% with the use of fluorophores for detection (data not shown). As shown by the Probit data, the HBV LAMP Assay also revealed a 100% detection rate for 25, 50, 102, 103, and 104 IU of HBV DNA per reaction, while 1 IU and 10 IU of HBV DNA were detected at 25% and 57% rates, respectively. These findings suggest that the LAMP-assay performed efficiently when used in testing and analysis of clinical specimens for HBV-infection.",
                                "Sample enrichment and volume play a critical role in detection sensitivity. The HBV-LAMP assay employed a smaller starting-volume for nucleic acid extraction and a smaller input-volume for amplification than the Procleix\u00ae Ultra\u00ae assay, yet yielded a sensitivity of 92%. Thus, given its plausible performance vis-\u00e0-vis the clinical and epidemiological relevance of HBV infection, the HBV LAMP assay is potentially applicable in field environment and in clinical-settings for screening and rapid detection of HBV-infection.",
                                "Notably, the HBV LAMP assay also successfully detected HBV DNA in heat-treated plasma, irrespective of the possible presence of potential amplification inhibitory substances that are found in blood-products (Al-Soud et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 38:345-350, 2000; Al-Soud et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 39:485-493, 2001). This method of template preparation (as opposed to nucleic acid extraction) contributed to the rapidity of the assay and simplified the detection process; however, an increase in the volume of starting material from 25 \u03bcL to a larger volume (for example, 100 \u03bcL) may improve the sensitivity of detection when using heat-treated plasma for the reaction.",

J. Clin. Microbiol. 41:5473-5477, 2003). The LAMP assay detected various HBV-genotypes (A-F), thereby demonstrating its global coverage of HBV detection. When healthy donor plasma samples (n=107) were tested, the HBV-LAMP assay revealed a diagnostic specificity of 100%, as no amplification of HBV-DNA was observed in these specimens. This characteristic of the HBV-LAMP assay was also confirmed by its detection of only the target HBV-DNA without cross-reaction with CMV, PV, T. cruzi, and the Leishmania spp.",

This rapid trend of human migration has influenced the spread of viral hepatitis and its changing epidemiology from Afghanistan to Pakistan, from the Indian sub-continent and Asia to Eastern Mediterranean, North Africa and the United States. Hence, the severity and prevalence of HBV emphasizes the need for a rapid and affordable diagnostic-screening tool as described herein, which could be used to investigate HBV-prevalence in different regions of the world.",
                                "A noteworthy advantage of the LAMP-assay described herein is its use of a thermo-stable reaction buffer (Mannitol-Acetate-Buffer) and the Bst DNA-polymerase, two major components that allowed preparation of reaction-mixture at room temperature as well as performance of amplification under isothermal conditions without compromising sensitivity. Bst DNA polymerase has DNA strand-displacement activity, while L-Proline has a destabilizing effect on the DNA double-helix, lowers the Tm of DNA, confers salinity tolerance, and aids in DNA polymerase stability (Walker et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 20:1691-1696, 1992; Walker, PCR Meth. Appl. 3:1-6, 1993; Rajendrakumar et al., FEBS Lett. 410:201-205, 1997). In addition, D-Mannitol, a hygroscopic and osmopotent material also promoted buffer stability and robustness under thermo-stressed conditions (Dittmar et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. 27:333-335, 1935; Ohrem et al., Pharm. Dev. Technol. 19:257-262, 2014). As demonstrated by the accelerated stability tests, the MAB surprisingly retained a considerable level of stability and robustness.",
                                "The advent of nucleic acid amplification tests in clinical diagnosis and donor blood-screening brought tremendous improvement by ensuring safety of blood-products and prevention of disease transmission. Yet, diagnostic tools such as PCR-based tests have inherent limitations which include the lack of rapidity, laborious performance process, use of cumbersome equipment, and being easily prone to contamination. In contrast, the HBV LAMP assay described herein demonstrates ease of performance, rapidity, sensitivity, and the use of multiple-primers that makes the assay highly specific and less liable to cross-contamination. Considered in aggregate, this HBV LAMP detection assay is rapid, simple to use, and specific."

                                "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family (Moratorio et al., Virol. J. 4:79, 2007). Primarily transmitted through transfusion of contaminated blood, infection with HCV may go silent for several years and lead to chronic-active hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Ghany et al., Hepatology 4:1335-1374, 2009; Liang et al., Ann. Int. Med. 132:296-305, 2000; NIH Consensus Statement on Management of Hepatitis C; NIH Consens. Sci. Statements 19:1-46, 2002). Approximately 170 million people globally are infected with HCV. In the United States alone about 3.7 million people are diagnosed with HCV infection, wherein HCV genotypes 1 and 2 account for a majority of infections (Armstrong et al., Ann. Int. Med. 144:704-714, 2006; Zein, Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 13:223-235, 2000). There are six major genotypes of HCV with several subtypes found in different regions of the world (Lamballerie et al., J. Gen. Virol. 78:45-51, 1997; Simmonds, Hepatology 21:570-583, 1995; Simmonds et al., Hepatology 10:1321-1324, 1994). Thus, screening for HCV in blood is important in providing information on its prevalence in various populations and communities around the world, while identification of the specific HCV genotype is clinically important for implementing effective antiviral treatment (de Leuw et al., Liv. Intl. 31:3-12, 2011; Alestig et al., BMC Inf. Dis. 11:124, 2011; Etoh et al., BMC Res. Notes 4:316, 2011). Therefore, there is a need for a specific, sensitive, simple, and robust diagnostic-screening test that can detect HCV infection in blood-derivatives and simultaneously provide genotypic information.",
                                "A plethora of diagnostic tests for detection and genotyping of HCV infection have been designed. These tests are expensive, labor-intensive, and require well-equipped laboratories and highly trained personnel to conduct (Rho et al., J. Microbiol. 46:81-87, 2008; Nolte et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 33:1775-1778, 1995; Sabato et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 45:2529-2536, 2007). Additionally, these tests are prone to cross-contamination and are further limited in their ability to detect and simultaneously identify the specific HCV genotype (Corless et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 38:1747-1752, 2000; Duarte et al., PLoS One 5:e12822, 2010). These limitations render current methods unsuitable for use in clinical settings in the developed-world setting and in resource-limited facilities mainly found in developing countries where sophisticated biomedical diagnostic equipment may be lacking.",

The amplification process is accomplished within 60 minutes, utilizing thermostable enzymes, a robust thermostable reaction-buffer, and three sets of oligonucleotide that target conserved as well as sparsely polymorphic sequences in the 5\u2032-non coding region (NCR) of the HCV genome.

In order to ensure genotype distinction, primers were designed to target sequences with sparse nucleotide diversity or polymorphism within the conserved 5\u2032-NCR (Bukh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4942-4946, 1992). A universal primer set and one set for each genotype were made (Table 1; Example 1). In order to ensure broader coverage for HCV-2 isolates, the 5\u2032-end of primer sequence HCV2-R3 (SEQ ID NO: 27) was designed with a \u201cG\u201d to \u201cC\u201d reverse-complementary nucleotide substitution at position one and a \u201cC\u201d to \u201cT\u201d substitution at position three.

This assay demonstrates salient advantages over methods that require intensive labor and exotic equipment. First, the HCV RT-LAMP genotyping assay was performed as a one-step-procedure, thus obviating the need for an extra cDNA-synthesis step; it utilized two thermostable enzymes (Bst DNA polymerase and cloned-AMY reverse-transcriptase) that catalyzed both synthesis and amplification of the HCV-RNA in a single reaction-tube, using a single temperature. Second, the assay employed three pairs of gene-specific primers directed at specific regions on the HCV genome, thus ensuring specificity and amplification efficiency. Third, the assay detected and simultaneously identified the HCV-genotype tested without requirement for extra genotyping procedure. Fourth, test-results were available in approximately 75 minutes, instead of the 3 to 5 hours required for other genotyping and detection-formats in which products are separately genotyped by restriction enzyme analysis, reverse hybridization, or nested RT-PCR.",
                                "In regions of the world with high prevalence of HCV infection, surveillance and epidemiological studies are periodically conducted in order to establish distribution patterns. This requires a diagnostic assay that is sensitive and specific. In this example, the HBV RT-LAMP genotyping assay demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 25 IU/reaction of HCV-RNA using heat-treated template (without RNA extraction), while detection of 7 IU/reaction of HCV-RNA was achieved when extracted RNA was used. Addition of GelGreen\u2122 intercalating dye to the tubes at the end of the reactions allowed for naked-eye rapid visualization of the assay detection-level of as little as 1.4 IU of HCV-RNA. In addition, the assay detected HCV-RNA in all 20 infected clinical donor specimens, thus revealing a 100% diagnostic sensitivity. The primer specificity of this assay is highly plausible as the amplification yielded detection of only HCV-RNA and the specific HCV-genotypes tested for, but reacted negative to RNAs of phylogenetically related viruses (Dengue and West Nile).",
                                "The 5\u2032-NCR of the HCV genome was utilized for primer design due to its highly conserved nature across the HCV genotypes. For genotype-identification, primer design exploited the sparse nucleotide diversity and polymorphism that exist within the 5\u2032-NCR among the HCV genotypes. This approach contributed to the high specificity of genotype-identification, thereby clearly and accurately distinguishing between HCV 1, 2, and 3 as indicated by the difference in the banding-patterns for each genotype. This characteristic of the assay was validated by testing clinical samples. When donor plasma samples were tested by the RT-LAMP-Genotyping method, the test detected and accurately differentiated the clinical samples that were positive for HCV-1, 2, and 3. All 50 negative/normal human plasma tested negative, thereby demonstrating a diagnostic specificity of 100%. Furthermore, when donor serum samples were employed as test-substrates, the assay detected the presence of HCV in all three serum-specimens using the universal primer set-HCVU. HCV-3 was not tested with the universal primer set, because of its unavailability at the time of testing. Collectively considered, these results demonstrate the capability of the assay to detect HCV, including genotype 4, in plasma and serum. The results have also demonstrated the specificity of the isothermal assay for detection and simultaneous genotyping of HCV, thus rendering the assay potentially applicable in clinical settings where genotype information is important in designing targeted therapeutic management of infected patients.",
                                "A major defining characteristic of the HBV RT-LAMP assay is the demonstration of specificity not only by absence of non-specific bands in the amplification products, but by the demonstration of genotype-specific banding patterns of the targeted genomic sequences. This enables an investigator or end-user to distinguish true positive amplification patterns from atypical band-laddering that may occur in a reaction due to non-specific priming (Curtis et al., J. Med. Virol. 81:966-972, 2009). A review of the literature revealed studies which utilized the 5\u2032-NCR for primer design and have attempted the use of the RT-LAMP method for HCV detection (Esfahani et al., Af J. Microbiol. Res. 4:2580-2586, 2010; Wang et al., FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 63:144-147, 2011). Notably, these studies were confined only to detection, while another study was performed as a two-step method. Also, these studies failed to demonstrate distinguishing pattern-formation of amplicons of the HCV genotypes tested (Esfahani et al., Af J. Microbiol. Res. 4:2580-2586, 2010; Wang et al., FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 63:144-147, 2011). In contrast, our test was performed as: (1) a one-step procedure, (2) a detection and genotyping method, and (3) demonstrated distinctive genotype-unique banding-patterns of HCV 1, 2, and 3.",
                                "Rapid, simple, and accurate identification of pathogens are important for timely therapeutic intervention, and for disease control and surveillance. This concern was addressed by simplifying the substrate preparation process. Plasma standards were heat-treated and used as a template in the amplification-reaction, thereby obviating the extra RNA extraction step and saving time. Use of fluorescence dyes for immediate end-point-read-out also added to the rapidity and simplicity of the assay by obviating gel-end-point analysis. Additionally, the assay accurately detected HCV RNA without assay efficiency being compromised by PCR inhibitory substances that are usually found in blood components and tend to inhibit PCR methods (Al-Soud et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 38:345-350, 2000; Al-Soud et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 39:485-493, 2001).",
                                "In conclusion, the HCV RT-LAMP genotyping assay described in this example has demonstrated its sensitivity, specificity, robustness, and ability to accurately identify HCV-RNA at the genotypic level. This assay may be used to aid clinicians in designing genotype-targeted therapy and follow-up of patients on antiviral treatments. Due to its simplicity and lack of requirements for elaborate equipment or extensive freezer storage conditions, this HCV RT-LAMP assay has also shown its suitability for clinical point-of-care application and epidemiological studies in resource-limited environments, HCV-endemic regions, and in developed world-settings."

                                "For several decades transfusion and clinical medicine have been bridled with issues of contaminated blood from infected donors. This has led to routine testing of potential blood donors in the United States and in many developed countries for blood-borne pathogens. The ultimate public health goal has been to ensure safety of the blood and blood-products supply as well as ensure early diagnosis for immediate therapeutic invention. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the emerging Hepatitis E virus (HEV) together infect approximately 700 million people globally and may lead to chronic active hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compromises the immune system, while Dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV) cause hemorrhagic fever and neurodegenerative symptoms, respectively.",
                                "Serological and nucleic acid test methods, including ELISA and quantitative (reverse transcription) polymerase chain reaction or q-(RT)-PCR, have traditionally been used to test for these viruses and other pathogens. Performance of ELISA is laborious, employs antibody for detection, is less sensitive, and may miss the window-period of some infections, such as HBV, HCV and HIV. On the other hand, quantitative RT-PCR uses oligoprobes that hybridize to the nucleic acid target and allows not only for specific detection, but also for quantitation of target DNA or RNA in real-time.",
                                "However, these methods are time-consuming and expensive. These methods of pathogen detection also require elaborate machines and highly trained personnel to perform. Also, quantitative RT-PCR requires thermocycling for amplification. On the other hand, the quantitative multiplex fluoro-isothermal assay described in this example is simple and inexpensive. It utilizes three pairs of pathogen-specific oligonucleotides, with a strategically attached reporter/fluorophore-quencher pair that emits fluorescent signal or glow when the fluoro-oligo hybridizes to the specific target. This new multiplex isothermal amplification assay can be used for detection and identification pathogens as well as quantitation of pathogen burden in blood.",
